   and was not given any additional Lasix.  She was taking
   poor p.o.  She underwent calorie counting which revealed

   Staphylococcus.  The patient was treated with vancomycin
   for two days until her culture came back.  This was felt
   to be a contaminant and vancomycin was discontinued.  The
   patient was felt to be at high-risk for Clostridium
   difficile colitis as she developed diarrhea with elevated
   LFTs.  She was started on three days of IV Flagyl for
   concern of not absorbing her p.o. dosage.  The patient

   creatinine of 1.4 on the 7th but subsequently elevated her

   with assistance with her meals which subsequently improved
