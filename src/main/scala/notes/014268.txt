Brief Hospital Course:
Summary

19F with repeated flares of presumed asthma presents with
recurrent event with drop in her peak flow from 400->250, cough,
fever, and multifocal infiltrate on CT. Patient was given a FQ
abx last time, but apparently did not improve. Was started on on
ceftriaxone, azithro and pulse dose steroids. She decompensated
with tachypnea to the 40's and violent, stridorous breathsounds.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she underwent direct larygoscopy revealing vocal
cord dysfunction. She did well with anxiolytics and was
discharged to follow up outpatient

By Problem

Vocal Cord Dysfunction

     Clued to a diagnosis other than asthma by the lack of
wheezing and normal lung volumes, direct larygoscopy revealed
vocal cord dysfunction. This is a condition that likely exists
as part of a syndrome of anxiety and coping dysfunctions
manifested in her several diagnoses (eating disorders, sphincter
of oddi dysfunction, lactose intolerance) and is superimposed
upon her Asthma and GERD. She will need follow up for her voice
technique and management of her anxiety/coping.
