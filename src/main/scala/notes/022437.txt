headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
29 y/o male with PMH of migraines,mild Asthma, orbital wall
fracture right eye 2 years ago and multiple head injuries from
sports. He states for the last 2 months he has intermittent
sudden headaches lasting 2 minutes, he states he feels the need
to valsalva when clear his head with this happens. He also
reports right eye visual field changes and one episode of LOC
that was contributed to dehydration and hyponatremia. He
reported
the headache symptoms to his PCP who sent him for a CT on [**6-5**] and they called him and gave him a neurology appointment for
[**6-11**] due to hydrocephlus. Today he had one of his normal
headaches but it lasted much longer approximately 2 hours and he
went to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] ER and was sent here. He now denies
any
headaches or visual changes.

Pertinent Results:
[**2148-6-8**] NCHCT:
Non communicating hydrocephalus with mild transependymal
migration of CSF.
[**2148-6-9**] MRI:
Noncommunicating hydrocephalus, there is evidence of a subtle
enhancing mass lesion attached to the superior aspect of the
cerebral aqueduct on the right measuring approximately 8 mm.
[**2148-6-9**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Irregular pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe as
described above. While this may be infectious in nature,
particualrly in the presence of the other pulmonary nodules, it
is concerning for malignancy. A PET CT may be considered to
further evaluate this finding.
2. Ill-defined pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe in a
tree-in-bu
configuration suggest infection process.
3. Left lung base subpleural enhancing are may represent a
second nodule or atelectasis.
4. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes identified.
5. Non-specific ill-defined slight increased sclerotic focus
within the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] is identified (3, 106).
[**2148-6-9**] chest CT:
1. Irregular pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe as
described above. While this may be infectious in nature,
particualrly in the presence of the other pulmonary nodules, it
is concerning for malignancy. A PET CT may be considered to
further evaluate this finding.
2. Ill-defined pulmonary nodules in the right upper lobe in a
tree-in-bu
configuration suggest infection process.
3. Left lung base subpleural enhancing are may represent a
second nodule or atelectasis.
4. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes identified.
5. Non-specific ill-defined slight increased sclerotic focus
within the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] is identified (3, 106).
Post-OP NCHCT:
Small foci of hemorrhage adjacent to the craniotomy in the right

frontal lobe as well as a tiny amount of hemorrhage in the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle are within the
spectrum of post surgical change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was was found to have a mass in the cerebral aqueduct with a
noncommunicating hydrocephalus on MRI and CT.  Patient was
admitted to the SICU for close neurological examination and was
prepared for surgery. Chest CT showed multiple small lung
nodules concerning for an infectious vs malignant process.
These nodules will require close follow-up with a chest CT in
three months.  An abdominal and pelvic CT was unremarkable.
Patient underwent a stereotactic biopsy of the mass and an
endoscopic stereotactic third ventriculostomy on [**2148-6-10**].
Patient tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, and
transerred to the PACU in stable condition.  His neurological
exam was stable in the PACU.  A post-op NCHCT showed typical
post-operative changes.  Patient was then transferred to the
SICU in stable condition. He continues to progress well with
stable neurologic exam. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has discussed the results of
the anatomical pathology report with Mr. [**Known lastname **] and we will
arrange Brain tumor clinic appointment and follow ups. Care
coordination is following pt as well for anticipated needs.
