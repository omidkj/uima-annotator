Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB/PNA: Etiology most likely [**1-11**] to PNA and possible volume
overload due to missing HD; his SOB has improved after removing
2L from HD. On CT chest, he was noted to have diffuse bronchial
opacities concerning for infection. In ED, he was started on
vanc and cefepime. In MICU, continued vanc (dose based on level
and re-dose at HD) and started levofloxacin to cover for CAP and
possible HAP given recent admission in [**1-16**].  ID was consulted
and felt this was reasonable and low suspicion for other
infectious etiologies. Rapid resp panel was negative. He was
discharged on a course of PO levofloxacin (10 day course)
.
# HTN: Pt admitted with HTN urgency requiring nipride gtt likely
[**1-11**] to not taking BP meds for 2 doses prior to admission. Once
