45 year old male with history of CHF woke up this morning
vomiting black/red vomitus with chest pain.  Also having tan
diarrhea.  He says he has had episodes similar to this in the
past.  He initially presented to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital.  There he was

Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to severe
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle.  There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
Abdominal US with Doppler:
Normal echogenicity of the liver with patent hepatic
vasculature. Decrease in the amount of ascites seen within the
abdomen since the prior examination. Right pleural effusion. A
spot was not marked for paracentesis given the minimal amount of
fluid.
.
CXR:
1. Left subclavian line tip in the mid SVC, without
pneumothorax.
2. Right basilar atelectasis versus aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
45 year old male with history of DM, CHF, esophagitis presenting
to [**Hospital1 18**] with coffee ground emesis, NSTEMI, pna/pleural
effusions, elevated LFTs, nephrotic syndrome.
.
# Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain:
In ED, there was a question of coffee ground emesis.  He was
given anzemet and reglan with minimal relief.  A CT scan was
negative for appendicitis.  He
declined nasogastric tube placement.  His symptoms were
consistent with gastroparesis, especially since his pain
improved with reglan. He had right flank tenderness and right
upper quadrant tenderness with rebound.  An RUQ ultrasound
showed a normal gallbladder with no evidence of stones.  An
upright chest x-ray showed no evidence of free air.  An
abdominal plain film was negative for obstruction and free air.
He was kept NPO and maintained on IV fluids and a PPI.
His symtoms were unlikely cardiac in nature since he ruled out
for an MI by serial enzymes.  Head MRI was negative for a
cerebellar lesion that could contribute to nausea and vomiting.
He required the addition of erythromycin in addition to his
antiemetic regimen to control his nausea and vomiting.  He then
tolerated a gastric emptying study that showed rapid emptying of
gastric contents within one hour.
.
# Upper GIB:
It was suspected that patient's coffee ground emesis was due to
prior AVMs vs. Gastritis vs. [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.  In the MICU,
GI was consulted but because of his stable clinical condition,
did not feel that he needed to have EGD urgently, especially in
the setting of a NSTEMI.  In the MICU, the patient received 1U
PRBC, and remained hemodynamically stable.  He was on protonix
gtt and then [**Hospital1 **], Hct goal was >28 in setting of NSTEMI.
.
He was sent to the medical floor on [**2195-1-25**], and remained stable
till 2:40 AM and then had 240cc of hematamesis.  Patient's SBP
at the time 170 and HR 20.  GI was called, and pt returned to
the MICU.  The next AM, he was scoped and initially found to
have esophagitis and a bleeding artery.  Initially, epinephrine
injections were attempted to try to stop the bleeding but were
unsuccessful.  Thus, he required banding, which stopped the
bleeding.  His Hct was checked Q6 hours thereafter and were
stable.  Hence, he was called out again on [**2195-1-26**] to the floor.
Antihypertensives were held in the setting of the GIB; the
carvedilol was restarte
