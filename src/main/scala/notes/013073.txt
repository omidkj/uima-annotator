Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo M  with CAD, chronic diastolic CHF and HTN with
cholangitis and E Coli bacteremia.

Cholangitis and E Coli bacteremia. Pt presented with nausea,
chest pain, fever and was found to have transaminitis and
hyperbilirubinemia. His blood cultures from [**Location (un) 620**] were
positive for E.Coli sensitive to levofloxacin. He was
transferred from [**Hospital3 628**] and underwent ERCP with
stone/sludge removed. He had a sphincterotomy with stent
placement. He had findings of a biliary [**Doctor Last Name **] vs abscess in the
right intrahepatic system. He was placed on cipro/flagyl with
resolution of clinical symptoms and normalization of LFT's and
bilirubin. He will complete 2 total weeks of antibiotics.  His
home simvastatin and acetaminophen were held due to LFTs and can
be restarted 4 days after discharge. For recurrent fevers he
should have an U/S or MRI of the liver to rule out abscess. He
needs a f/u ERCP for stent removal in [**4-17**] weeks. The patient did
not have gallbladder stones on RUQ U/S done at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and
based upon the ERCP report, this seems mostly to have been
sludge mediated. For now he appears to have adequate biliary
drainage and there is no plan for cholecystectomy.

HTN, CAD. The patient presented with chest pain complaints. He
had no ECG changes and normal cardiac enzymes. He continues on
his home medication regimen except statin which can be restarted
4 days after discharge.

Dysphagia. The patient complained of intermittent dysphagia.
Speech and swallow eval was within normal limits. He can
continue on a regular diet.
