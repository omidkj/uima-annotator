Brief Hospital Course:
She was found to have a right cerebellar hemorrhage on CT Scan.
She was also found to be in atrial fibrillation (new onset).
She was initially admitted to the Neuro-ICU for further
management.  On [**9-30**] she was transferred to the Neurology
floor.

1. Neuro:
The patient was admitted to the neuro-ICU.  Neurosurgery was
also consulted and followed the patient during her
hospitalization-they felt that surgical management was not
indicated.  The most likely etiology of her hemorrhage is HTN.
She was started on mannitol 25g IV q6hours which was tapered,
then d/c'd on [**10-1**].  To keep her SBP<140, she was started on
labetolol drip.  She was switched to metoprolol and her blood
pressure remained controlled.  All anti-platelet agents were
held initially-she will re-start ASA 81mg on [**10-13**] (2
weeks post hemorrhage).  She will need to start Coumadin in the
future for stroke prevention (since she has Afib).  Coumadin
should be started in one month.  Please discontinue aspirin once
Coumadin is initiated.  Her neurologic exam has remained stable,
although her ataxia has improved to some degree.  She will need
follow up imaging (MRI/MRA) in one month to evaluate parenchyma
and intracranial circulation.  She should also follow up in
stroke clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after the MRI is done.

2. CV:
She was found to be in rapid Afib (new onset).  She was started
on a labetalol drip and converted to metoprolol with adequate
rate control. Anti-coagulation was contra-indicated in the acute
setting of ICH and Coumadin was therefore not started (this
should be started in one month as noted above).  She had mild
troponinin elevation 0.11 which trended down over her course.
Echo showed moderately dilated left and right atria, mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis with preservation of basal wall motion.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (EF 30-39%), Moderate AS, Mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+)
mitral regurgitation. She was started on ACEI.  Cardiology was
consulted and recommended increasing metoprolol as tolerated to
reach goal HR of 60bpm, starting amiodarone 400mg tid for 2
weeks, then decreasing dose to 400mg daily for two weeks, then
decreasing the dose again to 200mg daily.  Because the patient
was intermittently in NSR, we did not pursue TEE and
cardioversion.  Cardiology also recommended outpatient stress
test to evaluate for CAD.
She should have her TFTs and LFTs checked as an outpatient since
she will be on Amio.

4. Endo:
Free T4 and TSH were normal.  Her HbA1C was mildly elevated.
She should follow a diabetic diet and have her fingersticks
monitored daily while in rehab.  Please re-check her HbA1C as an
outpatient.

7. ID:
She was found to have and elevated WBC and left shift.  Urine
culture grew pan sensitive E.coli.  She is s/p 7 day course of
Levofloxacin.

8. Ophthal:
Glaucoma meds were continued.

9.  Rehab:
Pt was followed by PT and will require continued physical
therapy.
