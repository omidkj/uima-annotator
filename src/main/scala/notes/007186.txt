Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old gentleman
with severe peripheral vascular disease who has had several
acute myocardial infarctions as well as congestive heart
failure.  He has a history of chronic obstructive lung
disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.  He presented
on [**8-28**] to [**Hospital6 33**] with unstable angina.
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease.  He had a 100%
occlusion of his proximal left anterior descending artery, a
90% occlusion of his distal left anterior descending artery,
a 90% occlusion of his left circumflex, a 100% occlusion of
his right coronary artery as well as an ejection fraction of
20% to 25%.  He was also noted to have a left ventricular
aneurysm.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for management of his severe
coronary artery disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  He had an inferior myocardial infarction in [**2142**] that was
treated with thrombolysis.
2.  He had an anterior wall myocardial infarction in [**2143**] and
was treated with a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of his left anterior descending artery.
3.  He has peripheral vascular disease, status post right
femoral stent in [**2153**].
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Congestive heart failure.
7.  Cervical spine fracture status post motor vehicle
accident.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Preadmission medications were)
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Tenormin 25 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Admission examination
revealed the patient was alert and oriented.  He was
neurologically intact.  He had a regular rate and rhythm.
His lungs were clear.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  His extremities were warm and well perfused.
His lower extremity veins appeared within normal limits
without varicosity or venous stasis changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Service on [**2153-8-28**].  Adequate
resuscitation of his hemodynamic condition was carried out
overnight.

On hospital day two, the patient underwent and uncomplicated
repair of his left ventricular aneurysm as well as a coronary
artery bypass graft consisting of the left internal mammary
artery to the first obtuse marginal branch, and the saphenous
vein graft to the second obtuse marginal branch.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit intubated and in stable
condition.

Postoperatively, the patient was noted to have two runs of
ventricular tachycardia.  His magnesium and potassium levels
were repleted, and he was bolused with lidocaine and was
started on a lidocaine drip at 2 mg per minute.  He was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated without incident.
He was loaded with amiodarone overnight while remaining
atrial paced with an underlying sinus rhythm at a rate in
the 70s.

On the morning of postoperative day one, the patient went
into ventricular tachycardia at a rate in the 170s with a
systolic blood pressure drop to the 50s.  Lidocaine was
given, and the patient was cardioverted at 200 with immediate
conversion to sinus rhythm.  The patient continued to require
supplemental oxygen with a face mask at 60% in order to
maintain his oxygen saturations.  He was making good urine.

On postoperative day two, the patient had an episode of flash
pulmonary edema treated with 40 mg of intravenous Lasix.  He
remained on the nonrebreather with an oxygen saturation
of 93%.  The Electrophysiology Service had consulted on him
and recommended that the ventricular tachycardia could be
suppressed by atrially pacing him and continuing the
amiodarone.

On postoperative day three, the patient continued to require
supplemental oxygen.  He had an episode of slow ventricular
tachycardia at a rate of 150 that was treated with lidocaine
and Versed, and the rhythm was subsequently successfully
treated with rapid atrial pacing at 200.  A chest x-ray at
that time was notable for severe pulmonary edema, and his
face mask was changed to a 100% nonrebreather with oxygen
saturations still only in the 80% to 90% range.  He was begun
on an aggressive Lasix diuresis with good affect.

On postoperative day four, the patient was noted to be having
a continued oxygen requirement on 100% nonrebreather with
marginal arterial blood gases.  He had persistent increase in
work of breathing, and the decision was made to be
reintubated.  The patient underwent a transesophageal
echocardiogram which demonstrated no VEA while being both on
and off atrial pacing.

The patient continued to be plagued by brief episodes of
ventricular tachycardia responsive to rapid atrial pacing.
On postoperative day seven, the patient underwent placement
of a intra-aortic balloon pump.  At that time, a plan was
initiated to hold lidocaine while monitoring for ventricular
tachycardia with 12 lead pads in place for the purpose of
obtaining a 12-lead electrocardiogram which may allow for
identifying a focus for future ablation.  The patient
remained intubated and ventilated with no remarkable changes
in respiratory status.

On postoperative day eight, the patient was initiated on
total parenteral nutrition.  On postoperative day nine, the
patient underwent cardiac mapping of his ventricular
arrhythmias in the Electrophysiology laboratory.  Based on
these results he underwent multiple ablations of what
appeared to be the fossae of his arrhythmias.  He tolerated
the procedure well and was subsequently transported back to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition
with all external pacing off and on a Pronestyl drip.

On postoperative day 10, the patient remained sedated and
intubated.  His intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued,
and he was started on tube feeds.  The patient was noted to
have an increasing white blood cell count, and so his central
lines were replaced.  Throughout the day he was successfully
weaned to CPAP with 5 of pressure support; however, only with
marginal oxygenation.

As the patient had an increasing white blood cell count, and
it was decided that he was going to need to have automatic
internal cardioverter-defibrillator placed to control his
ventricular arrhythmias, an Infectious Disease consultation
was obtained.  Their recommendations included continuing the
vancomycin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone antibiotic regimen that
he was on while waiting for the blood cultures to be
finalized, as well as changing the site of his arterial line.

On postoperative day 12, the patient was weaned from his
ventilator and extubated without incident.  He was placed on
50% cool aerosol maintaining saturations of 97% to 100%
without any respiratory distress.

On postoperative day 13, the patient was seen by the Renal
Service for his rise in creatinine.  They felt that this
could most likely be explained by an acute event on [**9-4**]
when his creatinine bumped from 0.7 to 1.2 in the setting of
worsening ventricular tachycardia.  Initiation of Vasopressin
and the placement of the intra-aortic balloon pump.  It was
felt that he subsequently developed acute tubular necrosis at
that time.  Further diuresis was therefore avoided.

On [**9-14**], after having remained afebrile with a
decreasing white blood cell count the patient underwent the
placement of a [**Company 1543**] Model #7271, dual chamber,
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

By postoperative day 17, the patient continued to remain
afebrile and without any ventricular ectopy, with good
saturations and stable hemodynamics.  The decision was then
made to transfer the patient to the floor.

Once of the floor, the patient had an uncomplicated remainder
of his hospital course.  He had a chest x-ray on [**9-15**]
that demonstrated a lack of a pneumothorax.  His amiodarone
was discontinued.  His procainamide was changed to
