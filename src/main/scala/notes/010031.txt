former admission was for nausea/vomiting and resulted in a
diagnosis of gastroparesis. The latter admission was for edema
and weight gain which was felt to be secondary to dietary
indiscretion resulting in fluid overload as well right heart
failure secondary to left heart failure. A thorough work-up
included normal albumin, TSH and cholesterol. Diagnostic para
showing macrophages, though otherwise unrevealing. The patient's
ascites improved considerably with hemodialysis and
ultrafiltration. Also noted to have a pericardial effusion and
pulmonary hypertention by echo.
.
Four days prior to admission, patient felt dizzy prior dialysis
and fell onto the ground and onto his back. Since then, he has

relief. Did not go to dialysis today given his pain.

increased to 212/82 and was started on nitro gtt (titrated up to
50mcg/min). O2 sat fell to 80s and the patient was started on a
NRB. Noted to be somewhat lethargic but oriented x3. Treated for
hyperkalemia with calcium gluconate 1gram, 10 units of insulin,
amp of D50, amp of bicarb and kayexalate. For FS of 63, given

There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage. There is no mass
effect or shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles,
cisterns, and sulci maintain a normal configuration and the
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The visualized
paranasal sinuses are clear, the mastoid air cells are clear,
and no fractures are identified. The patient is edentulous.
.
CT L-SPINE ([**2149-9-20**]):
There is loss of the normal lumbar lordosis. Vertebral body
alignment is anatomic. Vertebral body height is preserved. No
fractures are
identified. Very mild posterior disc bulges are present at L3-L4
and L4-L5, there is no evidence for spinal canal narrowing. The
neural foramina are normal at all levels.

Alternate read: Nondisplaced fractures through left L1, L2
transverse processes.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73843**] [**Known lastname **] is a 45 man with with a history of diabetes
and ESRD on HD who was admitted on [**9-20**] with back pain and
hypertensive urgency after missing an HD treatment. Initially in
the ED, he was afebrile with a BP of 161/83. BP increased to
212/82 and was started on nitro gtt (titrated up to 50mcg/min).
O2 sat fell to 80s and the patient was started on a NRB. Noted
to be somewhat lethargic but oriented x3. Treated for
hyperkalemia (k 7.0)and admitted to the ICU for hypertensive
urgency. Of note, in setting of fall, had head CT which was
negative, and L spine CT with nondisplaced L2-L3 fracture. The
patient was seen by the orthopedics team with a recommendation
that no acute intervention or bracing was necessary.

In ICU, the plan was initially for HD, however after initiating
HD patient moved his arm and the AV fistula infiltrated, so
dialysis could not be continued at that time.  The patient was
managed with kayexalate and IV calcium, insulin.  HD was resumed
the next day without complications.  The patient's electrolytes
have remained stable.  He was placed back on his home regimen of
anti-hypertensives with adequate control of his BP.  Of note,
there was initial difficulty accessing the AV fistula with the
above mentioned infiltration.  To evaluate the patency a
fistulogram was obtained on [**9-25**] which showed no evidence of
clot and patent flow.  The area where the intial infiltration
occurred continues to improve.  The patient will be discharged
with HD follow up tomorrow at his outpatient center.  At
discharge the patient's potassium is 4.9. He will resume his
Tu,Th,Sat HD tomorrow.

In regards to the patient's back pain, he has sustained the
above mentioned non-displaced fractures that do not require
surgical intervention at this time. He will be discharged on
oxycodone for pain relief as well as a bowel regimen while
receiving narcotics.  The patient has been instructed to follow
up with his PCP if he develops any new neurological symptoms,
worsening back pain or weakness.
