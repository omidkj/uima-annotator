Brief Hospital Course:
# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation vs
atypical pneumonia: initially diagnosed with health care
acquired pneumonia and placed on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and
flagyl.  However, she improved rapidly with blood pressure
control and mild diuresis, and gives no history of fever, cough
or sputum production.  The clinical scenario makes me lean
towards flash pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertensive
emergency, with acute on chronic systolic heart failure
exacerbation.  On discharge, her lungs were clear and she
required no supplemental oxygen for the last 48 hours of her
stay.  Her home heart failure meds were restarted, including
oral Lasix, carvedilol, and isosorbide (short acting mononitrate
instead of SA form previously given).  An ace inhibitor was
started, as she had not been on one previously, in the setting
of heart failure with decreased EF.  I contact[**Name (NI) **] the nursing
home to discuss any recorded personal history of reactions to
ACE inhibitors, and there were none.  Additionally, given the
possibility of atypical pneumonia causing/contributing to her
presentation, she will finish a 5 day course of ciprofloxacin.
Vancomycin and flagyl were discontinued shortly after transfer
out of the ICU, and she remained afebrile with stable/normal
WBC.

# HTN -- see above, blood pressure well controlled on discharge.
 Was on nitro gtt on admit, weaned to home medications without
difficulty.

# PAF: continue on Amiodarone. Pt [**Name (NI) **] paced, device check
previously scheduled in [**Month (only) **].
.
# CAD: continue on carvedilol and aspirin, ROMI'd by enzymes. No
change in EKG.
.
# Hyperglycemia: likely in the setting of acute illness,
normoglycemic prior to discharge.  HgA1c <6%.
.
# Restless leg syndrome: continued on Ropinirole
.
# Depression: continued on mirtazipine

systolic range for greater than 24 hours.


Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized for respiratory distress.  It was due to
an acute on chronic systolic congestive heard failure (with
flash pulmonary edema), which resolved with blood pressure
control and diuresis.  It may have also been related to a
pneumonia, so we ask that you finish the antibiotics given.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight > 3 lbs.
