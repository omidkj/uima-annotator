[**2151-11-29**] ECHO EF 30%
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypo/akinesis of the distal half of the septum and
anterior walls and distal inferior and lateral walls. The apex
is mildly aneurysmal and dyskinetic. The basal segments contract
well. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening and
redundancy/systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve chordae.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD
lesion). Increased LVEDP.
.
[**2151-11-30**] CXR
FINDINGS: Compared to the film from the prior day, there is a
new left effusion with new left lower lobe volume loss. A
femoral Swan-Ganz catheter with tip in the right pulmonary
artery is unchanged. The alveolar infiltrate on the right has
improved, but there continue to be interstitial markings that
are increased in both upper lobes. There is some moderate right
effusion that has also increased.

IMPRESSION: Likely CHF with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
While the alveolar infiltrate on the right has improved, the
increased interstitial markings and bilateral pleural effusions
have worsened.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 F w/o PMH of CAD presents with lg anterior STEMI.  Hospital
course complicated by:
.
# STEMI: Presentation ECG showed ST elevations across anterior
precordial as well as high lateral leads, unfortunately already
with Qs. Presentation CK was already near 1000. Cath showed 1vd
with TO of ostial LAD. s/p POBA.  Received ASA, Plavix, statin,
heparin gtt, integrillin x 18h.  Initially started metoprolol &
captopril but then held [**1-8**] hypotension.  ECHO showed depressed
EF w/ apical aneurysm so heparin ggt was continued with plan for
transition to coumadin.
.
# Respiratory: Was hypoxic/hypoxemic throughout hospital stay.
CXR showed ? RML PNA so was initially started on levo for CAP
coverage but then Vanc was added as she continued to spike
fevers and also with concern for line infection given her R
femoral line/PA catheter.
.
# Pump: EF 30%. Was continued on heparin ggt with eventual
transition to prevent apical thrombus.
.
On [**11-30**] a family meeting was held and the decision was made to
change goals of care to comfort measures only as this was
thought to be consistent with her wishes given her poor
prognosis.  She had been very uncomfortable while in the CCU and
wished to be "left alone".  She was initially treated with
morphine boluses and then transitioned to morphine ggt as she
continued to have respiratory distress.  She passed on [**2151-12-1**]
with her granddaughter at her bedside.
