unimpressive LP with only high protien with traumatic tap. given
history of back pain (acute on chornic), some urinary incontince
and history of IVDU in distant past pt underwent mri here which
revealed ? soft tissue density at t9-sacrum without contrast. Pt
subsequently intubated for repeat mri of better quality w/
contrast. repeat mri revealed no epidural abcess, soft tissue
mass outside her spinal canal. In Er pt recieved CTX, vanco and
acylovir for herpes encephalitis, LP sent for culture and HSV
pcr which are pending. Of note, LDH 1,400 (was 190 or so [**3-17**]!)
no signs of hemolysis, pcp/pna so likley some kind of lymphoma
(possibly the soft tissue mass seen on mri). ER course c/b right
mainstem intubation and infiltration of right arm with propofol

Brief Hospital Course:
1. MS CHANGE
- Quickly resolved. Was on ceftriaxone 2 gm IV 12 then 1 gm IV
12 and then discontinued on [**2106-10-6**] secondary to no clear source
of infection and mental status now at baseline.  It was felt
that her AMS was probably secondary to doxepin and its
associated cholingeric effects.

2. HIGH LDH, HIGH CK, T9 MASS:
- With no evidence of hemolysis, liver enzymes elevated, but
trended down quickly.
- Concern that LDH may be related to mass at T9, representing a
lymphoma - CT torso on [**2106-10-7**] showed no evidence of lymphoma or
[**Doctor First Name **]
- Neurosurgery was consulted, requested gallium scan to better
assess mass before considering biopsy - will get injection on
Friday, [**10-8**] and scan (3 days total) beginning Monday as an
outpatient.
- Other concern for myositis with elevated CKs, rheum was
consulted, felt not an inflammatory myositis was less likely but
possibly a steroid myopathy, will f/u with rheumatology as an
outpatient.

3. PERSISTENT FEVERS
- h/o spiking temps but has been afebrile since antibiotics
d/c'd, concerned mass at T9 is infectious, check blood cultures.
CXR shows no consolidation/pneumonia. Antibiotics d/c'd on
[**2106-10-6**]. Interestingly, no fevers after antibiotics were d/c'd.
CSF negative. Cryptococal serum levels normal.  Blood cultures
negative, urine cultures negative.  Pt had been afebrile for 48'
at time of discharge, no final source identified, but WBC
trended down to normal levels.

4. BACK PAIN- chronic, not new
- Contiued morphine prn, added back neurontin 300 [**Hospital1 **] then
increased to 600 TID then 600 four times daily as per neuro
attending who knows her well, added Baclofen now 20 mg TID with
goal to increase every day by 10 mg to 25 mg QID, added MsContin
XR 15 TID, Morphine IV prn.  Pain was well controlled on this
regimen.

5. Anemia - Her anemia remained stable throughout the course and
was felt to be due to chronic disease/inflammation and thus not
amenable to Fe-therapy.
