History of Present Illness:
74 year-old woman on anticoagulation w/ lovenox with a history
of bilateral PEs dx [**2126-5-14**], CRI, and CHF who now presents with
melena x 1 day and sob. She is s/p admit to medical service w/
?progression of PE/ increased clot burden. At that time, she
presented w/ sob that quickly resolved spontaneously, but
CTA/LENI's showed bilateral PEs/high clot burden. It was thought
that patient may have failed her coumadin that was dosed [**2126-5-14**]
on initial presentation of PE (dx'd by v/q scan). Heme was
consulted and recommended high dose lovenox at 1.5 mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]
(see their consult note). Pt was d/c home on this yesterday.
.
Pt reports returning from the hospital yesterday, doing well w/o
dyspnea, until this am when she noticed very dark brown stools,
slightly looser than normal. She denied any hematochezia. She
had normal stools yesterday and has never had melena before.
Denies abdominal pain, but notes increased heartburn over the
past several days, which is relieved with Tums. This am, with
black stool, she noted shortness of breath, no change from her
d/c, which resolved during transport to the hospital. In the ED,
another black stool was accompanied by faintness, diaphoresis,
and pallor with ambulation. She was unable to cooperate with
orthostatics due to her symptoms. Given protonix, ordered for 2
units of prbc's for hct drop 35-->27. Denies palpitations or
prior sx of orthostasis. Pt noted HTN this am, with SBP approx
170, associated with dyspnea.
On last admission, was felt to have failed coumadin and
therefore was discharged on Lovenox at 1.5mg/kg [**Hospital1 **]. No factor
Xa levels available.
ROS: negative for CP, abdominal pain palpitations, fever,
chills, dizziness. +sore throat since hospitalization.

-------------------
CXR ([**6-6**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Abd CT : IMPRESSION:
1. Large right thigh/groin hematomas. No retroperitoneal
hemorrhage
identified.
2. IVC filter in place.
3. Otherwise, overall stable appearance of the abdomen and
pelvis compared to the exam of [**2126-5-4**].
.
ECHO [**6-4**]: mild symmetric LVH, mildly depressed EF. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include anteroseptal and
apical HK. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared
with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2126-5-16**], right
ventricular cavity size is now smaller and free wall motion is
improved.
.
R groin u/s ([**6-6**]): IMPRESSION: Large right groin hematoma.
R groin u/s ([**6-11**]): IMPRESSION: Right groin hematoma is
decreased in size. No evidence of a pseudoaneurysm.
.
colonoscopy ([**6-10**]): Grade 2 internal hemorrhoids, diverticulosis
of the sigmoid colon, transverse colon and distal ascending
colon, no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding.
EGD ([**6-10**]): Previous gastroenterostomy of the stomach. The
efferent limb was explored until the distal gastroenterostomy
anastomosis was found. Bilious secretions were seen around the
anastomotic site. Again, no blood or ulcers were detected. There
was no blood or anastomic ulcers visualized in the gastric
pouch. Otherwise normal egd to gastroenterostomy

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 74yo woman w/ recent PEs and presumed coumadin
failure on high-dose LMWH in setting of CRI initially admitted
to MICU with melena and concern for UGIB and large right thigh
hematoma, now stable.
.
Hospital course is detailed below by problem:
.
1. Melena: Pt was admitted with melena, noted to have a Hct drop
of 34->27 in the setting of lovenox treatment for DVT/PEs. She
was admitted to the MICU, where she was transfused and her
anticoagulation was discontinued. On [**2126-6-10**], she had a
colonoscopy and EGD which showed no bleeding source. Meanwhile,
the pt's melena resolved. On discharge, she is no longer having
any melena.
.
2. Thigh hematoma: While in the MICU, the patient was noted to
have a rapidly expanding hematoma in her right thigh. The
vascular surgery team was called to evaluate it; after 15mins of
pressure, the bleeding halted. Pt was transfused (see above). On
discharge, the hematoma is diffusing and improving. She had an
ultrasound that showed a hematoma, then a repeat u/s showing it
as much smaller with no pseudoaneurysm.
.
3. PE/DVT: The patient had been on lovenox 80mg sq [**Hospital1 **] at home
when she began to bleed. All anticoagulation (including aspirin)
was thus stopped for her hospitalization. Since she had an IVC
filter, it was considered safe to keep her off the lovenox. She
did not experience any symptoms of PE. Given her history of PEs
and DVTs, the hematology team recommended beginning lovenox and
coumadin after 1 more week without anticoagulation. On [**2126-6-18**],
she should begin lovenox 1mg/kg renally dosed (70mg) sc bid as
well as coumadin 10mg po x 1 dose. On [**2126-6-19**], the coumadin
should be changed to 5mg po qd and maintained with goal INR [**1-17**].
The lovenox should be discontinued 48hrs after coumadin is
therapeutic to goal INR of [**1-17**]. Please check an INR qday
beginning on [**2126-6-18**].
.
4. ARF: During her hospitalization, the pt's Cr rose to 2.2 but
resolved with blood and fluids.
