History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29963**] is an 82y/o gentleman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] and
advanced Parkinson's disease whose wife brought him to the [**Name (NI) **]
because he was having difficulty swallowing at home, and he is
transferred to the ICU with concerns that he may not be able to
protect his airway and that he might have aspirated.
He was recently admitted for altered mental status, and per
Neurology his decreased responsiveness, stiff posture, and
agitation were likely due to advancing Parkinson's Disease.
This morning, the patient's wife reports that he has been more
lethargic, and that when she was feeding him an Ensure, the
liquid dribbled out of his mouth.  She is unsure if he
aspirated.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98, P 100, BP 148/78, R 34, O2 sat
90%2L NC.  He was given 1L IVF.  CXR was suggestive of mild
volume overload and also revealed a possible opacity; aspiration
could not be excluded.  The patient was given Levaquin and
Ceftriaxone.  Wife refused CT, and also expressed that the
patient is DNI.
Vitals on transfer: T 87, BP 112/68, RR 32, SaO2 98% 2L NC
.
In the ICU, the patient is somnolent bit arousable but hedoes
not comply with exam and cannot answer Review of Systems.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29963**] is an 82y/o gentleman with advanced Parkinson's
Disease brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by his wife for possible
aspiration and admitted to the ICU given concern of possible
airway compromise and need for intubation.

#PNA: Patient admitted with tachypnea, increasing respiratory
requirements, elevated WCC, and question of a new opacity on
CXR, in the setting of a AMS and question of aspiration.  The
team considered aspiration PNA to be the most likely diagnosis,
although PE was also considered (but patient's INR was
supratherapeutic).  At time of arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was able
to swallow his oral secretions and was believed to be able to
protect his airway.  He was started on Levofloxacin+Flagyl to
cover CAP and aspiration, which was then broadened to
CTX+flagyl.  He briefly spiked a fever to 102 with rigors, but
remained hemodynamically stable.  The gram stains on his blood
cultures came back with GPCs in [**3-1**] bottles.  His coverage was
broadened to cover MRSA with Vanco.  He remained stable from
hemodynamic and respiratory perspectives.  He was then
transfered to the floors, but was transferred back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] a
day later in the setting of fevers, decreased arouseability, and
low urine output.  At that time, his blood cultures were growing
enterococcus (Vanc-sensitive).  CXR showed progressing PNA.
Patient was stabilized, was satting well with a shovel mask and
humidified air (he is a mouth breather and does not sat well
with nasal cannula).  At the time of discharge, his WBC had
stabilized and he had been afebrile for >24H.  He was discharged
with a PICC line with plans for Vancomycin (14 day course for
bacteremia), and Ceftriaxone/Flagyl (7 day course for aspiration
pneumonia). Discharged home on O2 by face tent.

#. Parkinson's Disease: Patient with a history of progressive
[**Last Name (un) 3562**], with dementia, bradykinesia, paucity of speech, and
pill-rolling tremor.  Recently discharged after an episode of
"slumping over," with decreased arousability.  He was continued
on his Sinemet and Entacapone.  When he was made NPO for concern
of aspiration, an NG tube was placed so that he could receive
his Parkinson's medications.  Family wa
