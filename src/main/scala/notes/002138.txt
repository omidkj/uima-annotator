Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal aortic diameter at
the sinus level. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Mildly dilated
aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Moderate/severe
MVP. Mitral leaflets fail to fully coapt. No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 650**] (4+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears to
be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. There is moderate/severe P2 leaflet
mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully
coapt. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at
time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is A paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. There is a well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring in
place. No mitral regurgitation is seen. No paravalvular leak is
seen. There is a mean gradient of 1 mmHg across the mitral valve
at a cardiac output of 3.4 L/min. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mean gradient through the LVOT and aortic valve is 4
mmHg. Tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
