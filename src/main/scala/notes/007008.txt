Opioid Analgesics / Penicillins

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
80 Y F w/ PMH of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, widely metastatic
breast CA (to bones, lung, pleura, peritoneum, mediastinal and
inguinal lymph nodes), malignant pleural effusion requiring
intermittent drainage, s/p cytoxan, mtx cycle 2, presented to
clinic for a routine PRBC transfusion. While in clinic, she
complained of acute onset RUQ abdominal pain towards the end of
transfusion. She was therefore sent to the ED. While on transit
in the ambulance, she had an episode of nonbillous nonbloody
emesis. She also endorses 3 weeks of worsening shortness of
breath, productive cough with white sputum, fatigue, fevers and
chills and anorexia. In the ED, labs were concerning for new
abnormal LFTs with a predominantly cholestatic picture and CXR
showed BL pleural effusion R>L, and large R lung infiltrate
(with near white out) concerning for pneumonia. USS abdomen
showed ascites, gallstones without e/o acute cholecystitis. CT
abdomen showed GB wall thickening, gallstones, ? liver lesions,
but no e/o pancreatitis. CT chest showed BL pleural effusions, R
lung infiltrate. The patient was given IV vancomycin, flagyl,
zosyn and admitted to OMED for further management.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient's son says that she has
deteriorated over the past month, with malaise and anorexia, new
onset jaundice. Prior to this, she was walking on the treadmill.
Recently, she has been in bed most of the day. Also remarkable
for worsening BL LE edema.

thoracic and lumbar spine

# Left hip fracture [**2144**], s/p hemiarthroplasty.
MEDICATIONS
Furosemide 20mg daily
Quinapril 20mg daily
Prochloperazine 10mg prn TID nausea

able to ambulate although back pain worse when [**Last Name (un) 27797**] or
walking.  Able to cook on own and go to bathroom on own as well.

LFTs:

CT Abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly distorted internal anatomy due to severe vertebral
column changes and loss of anterior abdominal wall muscles,
which limits accurate evaluation of some of the visceral organs
such as pancreatic head and uncinate process which was not well
seen.
2. Gallbladder wall edema, generalized anasarca and ascites.
This likely
represents third spacing.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions loculated on the right with right
lower lobe opacity which could reflect post-obstructive
pneumonia with a component of atelectasis.
4. Multiple hepatic hypodensities, could represent simple cysts,
are unchanged.
5. Extensive osseous metastases with further loss of vertebral
body height as described above.
6. Bilateral common femoral vein thrombosis

AP chest compared to [**3-7**] through [**2158-3-10**]:19 a.m.

Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema in the left lung has increased,
moderate left
pleural effusion stable, right lung airless due in large part to
large right
pleural effusion. Heart size is indeterminate. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27798**] is a 81 year-old woman with metastatic breast
cancer including pulmonary metastases who presents with RUQ
pain, abnormal LFTs, and shortness of breath.
.
# Shortness of breath: Patient was tachypneic to 40, ABG showed
large A-a gradient. Likely contribution from tumor burden in
lungs, pleural effusions, pneumonia, volume overload.  She was
given vancomycin and Zosyn to treat the possible pneumonia. She
may also have had one or multiple pulmonary emboli given DVTs
seen on CT, lower extremity edema, and chest pain.  Lower
extremity Dopplers confirmed DVTs.  Given this, the team felt it
would be appropriate to transfuse platelets to >50k and then
heparinize.  However, the patient stated that she did not want
this intervention.  She also declined therapeutic thoracentesis.
 She was gently diuresed and given supplemental oxygen as neeed.
 Late in the evening on [**3-9**] she developed respiratory distress
and was placed on NRB and was satting at 88%.  She was
transfered to the ICU and was transiently placed on BiPAP. Her
Chest xray showed white out of the entire right lung as well as
portions of the left lung. It was determined that given her
underlying cancer thoracentesis would be ineffective and likely
would damage the lung further. Per her son she was made DNR/DNI
and then comfort measures only after diuresis did not improve
her oxygenation. She was given PRN morphine and appeared to
remain comfortable. She expired on [**2155-3-11**].
.
# Elevated LFTs and RUQ pain:  The cause of this was unclear.
[**Name2 (NI) 1194**] may have been an episode of biliary colic with transient
obstruction causing t bili and alk phos bump. Elevated GGT
confirmed a likely biliary source, and fractionation of
bilirubin demonstrated an elevated conjugated fraction, likely
from the biliary pathology, as well as an elevated unconjugated
fraction, which may have had contributions from both the liver
issues and her recent transfusion.  Haptoglobin and reticulocyte
count did not indicate evidence of hemolysis.  There was
gallbladder wall inflammation on CT but no cholecystitis by US.
She stated that she would not want surgical evaluation or
consideration of percutaneous drainage. She was initially NPO
but was adamant that she should eat.  Thus, her diet was
advanced.  The pain did not recur, and her alk phos and t bili
trended down.
.
# Metastatic breast cancer: s/p CMF cycle 2. Likely few further
chemotherapeutic options.  Further therapy was deferred to her
primary oncologist.
.
# HTN: She was normotensive.  Her ACEl was held in the setting
of contrast load with CT and increase in creatinine
.
# FEN: replete lytes, low salt diet
.
# PPX: bowel prophylaxis, PPI, TEDS
.
# ACCESS: PIV
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient [**2155-3-8**]
