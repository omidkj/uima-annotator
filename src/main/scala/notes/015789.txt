[**2127-5-21**] CXR:
A single frontal radiograph shows bilateral low lung volumes. In

addition, there is increased opacity / atelectasis / pneumonia
at the left
lung base, in a retrocardiac distribution and most notably at
the lateral
aspect of the left lung base, appearing to abut the pleura. The
remainder of the lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures and
soft tissue structures are similarly unremarkable.

[**2127-5-21**] CTA:
Multiple lobar and segmental bilateral pulmonary arterial
filling defects,
most prominently in those vessels supplying the lingula and left
lower lobe indicative of multiple pulmonary emboli. Associated
is a wedge-shaped opacity peripherally at the lingula,
concerning for possible associated pulmonary infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male with a h/o DVT x 2, alcohol use, and HTN who
presented with CP and SOB and was found to have B/L PE. The
following issues were addressed during this admission.

1. Left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath - No evidence
of cardiac ischemia on EKG or by enzymes. CTA with evidence of
B/L PE which is the most likely explanation for his chest pain
and shortness of breath. No evidence of pneumonia. Chest pain
and shortness of breath resolved by time of discharge.

2. B/L PE - Initially started on heparin gtt and transitioned to
Lovenox and coumadin for discharge. Ambulatory oxygen saturation
above 90% and no evidence of hypoxia on room air. Will have INR
checked at PCP's office on [**Month/Day/Year 766**].

3. HTN - BP controlled during admission. Decision was made to
address issue of anti-hypertensive therapy as an outpatient
given pt's history of noncompliance.
