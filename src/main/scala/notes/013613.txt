History of Present Illness:
This 76yo with history of AF, DM2, moderate MR, severe TR and EF
of 25-30% was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of NSVT.
.
  He had initially to his PCP [**2-20**] with difficulty focusing,
shaking, and weakness, was found to be in CHF (BNP [**Numeric Identifier 41960**]).  He
was transferred to Law Mem ED [**2-20**] in CHF and was diuresed with
Bumex 2mg x3 overnight. This morning at OSH he had 25-30 beats
of NSVT and was asymptomatic.  He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for EP
consult and possible ICD vs BiV ICD.  Of note he was recently at
OSH for treatment of pneumonia.

.
ECHO [**2110-3-4**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include inferior akinesis/hypokinesis and adjoining
inferolateral hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Compared to the prior
study of [**2110-2-22**] (images reviewed) mitral regurgitation is now
similar to slightly more prominent.
.
pMIBI: [**2-27**]:
1. Large, severe, mildly reversible inferior wall perfusion
defect and large,moderate, predominantly fixed anterior and
apical perfusion abnormalities.  2. Left ventricular dilatation
and global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 28%. 3. No
anginal symptoms or EKG changes.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**3-4**]:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-Ramus, SVG-D1, and SVG-PDA. External, functional
systolic
compression of SVG-PDA.
3. Patent LIMA-LAD.
4. Successful placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LAD.
5. Successful placement of a drug-eluting stent in the LMCA.

[**2110-3-3**] CXR:  Status post CABG. There is slight cardiomegaly
with mild upper zone redistribution and small bilateral pleural
effusions consistent with CHF. No pulmonary consolidation.
Minimal atelectasis, left lung base.
IMPRESSION: CHF. No overt pulmonary edema or pneumonia.

[**3-11**] CXR: Progression of CHF with increasing amount of pleural
effusions.

[**3-8**] colonoscopy: Extensive diverticulosis of the throughout
colon
Irregular vasculature , friability and erythema in the rectum
and sigmoid colon compatible with radiation proctitis. Internal
hemorrhoids with stigmata of recent bleeding. Bleeding possibly
from radiation proctitis vs. hemorrhoids

[**3-7**] LE U/S:  No DVT in either the right or left lower
extremity.
.
DFA for influenza, Legionella antigen both negative.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 yo m transferred from OSH for evaluation of
cardiac disease. He was undergoing workup for ICD vs. BiV ICD at
an OSH.  However he began spiking temperatures and his planned
p-MIBI was delayed.  He was treated with Levofloxacin for
pneumonia (? of LLL Pna on CXR from OSH).  He continued to spike
temperatures to 102.6 on [**2-24**].  The evening of [**2-24**] he had an
episode of hypotension with SBP in the 70s which resolved with
IV fluids.  PT worked with him and afterwards he had hypotension
with sytolic BPs in the 80s and increased O2 requirement.  He
got 3 250cc boluses with little effect, was placed on 6L FM.
Given concern over his severe CHF there was hesitancy to
continue giving too much IV fluid.  The MICU team was called to
evaluate him and he was transferred to MICU.

In the MICU, the patient was not given additional hydration
given poor heart function and normalization of BP. Because his
blood pressure stabilized, he did not require the addition of
pressors overnight.  Blood pressure medications were held. He
remained afebrile during his time there and antibiotics were
discontinued.  DFA was DFA was negative for influenza. Pt has a
h/o lymphoma, so low grade fevers and neight sweats could be
explained by the recurrence of his disease.  Patient should
follow up with his oncologist if these symptmoms persist.

Stress mibi showed global hypokinesis and LV dilatation, an EF
of 28% and a large, severe, mildly reversible inferior wall
perfusion defect and large, moderate, predominantly fixed
anterior and apical perfusion abnormalities. Cardiac
catheterization showed three vessel disease and a stent was
placed in the 90% occluded LCA.  He also had dynamic obstruction
of one branch of his twin LAD likely [**2-13**] obstruction from a
sternal wire or bone spur. We did not re-stent this obstruction
and cardiac surgery did not believe that replacing the sternal
wire was indicated.  The patient was placed on ASA and plavix,
which should continue for 9 months.  He is also discharged on a
beta blocker and ACE inhibitorHe had a complication of GI bleed,
but colonoscopy was negative except for large hemorrhoids. He
was started on a steroid suppository for hemorrhoid treatment
and GIbleeding decreased. His hematocrit remained stable for
several days prior to discharge.

The patient has ischemic CM with EF of 25-30%.  Cath
hemodynamics revealed elevated filling pressures.  He was
diuresed during his stay. He required 2LNC oxygen for O2 sats
abovve 95% and it is unclear what extent this is secondary to
CHF versus COPD.  He ambulated without O2 on the day of
discharge and felt mildly short of breath. He is discharged with
BB, ACE inhibitor, and lasix.

The patient continued to have many runs of assymptomatic NSVT
throughout his stay. He was evaluated by the electrophysiology
team, however, due to his recent stent placement ICd cannot be
placed at this time, as fibrillating the heard to test an ICD
would be contraindicated. He should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
as an outpatient in [**Month (only) 958**] to discuss ICD placement in the
future. He should be kept on telemetry at rehab.

During his stay the patient was kept on a diabetic diet and
followed with an insulin slide scale. He was also kept on his
usual inhalers and prn nebs for COPD.

He is discharged to a rehab facility, where he should have his
blood pressure monitored (goal as low as tolerated, sbp 80s-90s
acceptable), work with PT and weaned off his O2. He will follow
up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and with his usual
cardiologist.
