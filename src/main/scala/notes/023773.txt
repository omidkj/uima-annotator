History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of coronary
artery disease presented on [**5-22**] with anorexia, emesis x 2,
right-sided abdominal pain, malaise, and fatigue. She was noted
to have a mildly elevated white count of 13.6K. She had a RUQ
ultrasound in the ED which demonstrated moderate amount of
sludge with few shadowing stones in the gall bladder. A
presumptive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was made, and she
was admitted to the surgical service. She was started on
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. She was seen by GI (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 15831**] during the admission, who recommended conservative
management and consideration of elective cholecystectomy as an
outpatient. Her blood pressures on [**5-23**] ranged 110-147/53-82,
and on [**5-24**] ranged 132-180/73-91. She had increased RUQ pain the
morning of [**5-24**], and then triggered the night of [**5-24**] for
tachycardia to the 140's and hypoxia to 80% on room air. Cardiac
enzymes were checked, and the first set was elevated (troponin
0.11, CK at that time 82). Second set was elevated as well (T
0.22, CK 103). Cardiology was consulted. Of note, she was
consented for laparascopic cholecystectomy this morning. The
morning of admission, she again triggered for hypotension
(80/46), heart rate 56. She was given her usual dose of
metoprolol (12.5mg) this morning. On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she is
confused, tachypneic, and pale appearing. No further review of
systems was obtained from the patient. Per the family, she had
been complaining of back pain


She had been admitted twice within the past year for
choledocholithiasis ([**8-/2162**] with two 8-10mm stones in CBD,
sphincterotomy/stent but no stone extractions; [**11/2162**] stone
extraction and stent removed).

CT abdomen [**5-26**]:

1. Evidence of acute cholecystitis, with progression of
inflammation since
[**5-22**]. There is increased distention, wall thickening and
stranding, and at least one intraluminal stone is seen. No
intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.

2. An intraluminal oval rounded hypodense structure is seen near
the junction of the second and third portions of the duodenum,
previously hyperdense on a contrast-enhanced study (and
therefore possibly enhancing). The structure appears quite
hyperdense on the prior exam of [**5-22**]. The etiology is unclear.


There is no upstream duodenal dilation to suggest obstruction.
The
differential diagnosis includes atypical food particles/debris
(if not truly enhancing), polyp (if enhancing) and
neuroendocrine tumor is not excluded.

3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis.


4. Circumscribed fluid attenuation structure in the right hilar
region as
described, likely representing a pericardial cyst.

TTE [**5-26**]:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to severe
hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferior wall, inferolateral
wall and apex. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction. Mild aortic and moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. A pericardial cyst is not seen on this study.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yF with significant cardiac history admitted with ?
cholecystitis, transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension, hypoxia,
elevated white count.

#) Cholecystitis: Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] has a history of
choledocholothiasis, and she had 2 ERCP procedures in [**2162**] with
no complications. She presented on [**5-22**] with symptoms of
anorexia, vomiting, R-sided abdominal pain, and CT scan and U/S
reports concerning for acute cholecystitis. She was admitted to
surgery, started on cipro/flagyl, and monitored with serial
exams as her functional status and comorbidities did not make
her a good candidate for surgery.  In the setting of her sepsis
(see below), surgery continued to opt for medical management and
her coverage was broadened to include vancomycin and zosyn
(started [**5-25**]).  Vancomycin was discontinued when the bacteremia
pathogen was identified (Strep milleri). Over the course of her
hospitalization, Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] improved clinically with her
abdominal pain resolving and improving LFTs. She was discharged
with instructions to continue broad coverage for GI pathogens
with zosyn for 2 weeks, followed by a course of penicillin G
(renally dosed).

#) Sepsis: Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] was triggered on [**5-24**] for increasing
temperature to 99.5, tachycardic to 140s, and increased O2
requirement, as well as hypotenstion.,  She was found to be
bacteremic with positive cultures growing Gram positive Strep
milleri. She
