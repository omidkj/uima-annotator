History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old male with past medical history notable for
prostate cancer, temporal arteritis, hyperlipidemia, and gout
who presents today ont transfer with "massive bilateral PE's."
Per the patient he had been in his regular state of health until
several weeks ago he developed a severe flare of his gout that
he is finally getting over. More recently (approximately [**3-3**] wks
ago) he developed intermittent chest pain that would
occasionally radiate to his back or shoulder. This was about a
[**6-7**] severity and each bout of pain would last perhaps a few
minutes. This pain was nonexertional. In addition to this he
developed some dyspnea on exertion, which was not temporally
associated with the chest pain. This had perhaps been getting a
bit worse with episodes most days over the past week. This
morning while getting his pills he passed out and awoke on the
floor. He denies any prodrome, but after coming back to
consciousness he felt sweaty and unwell. He then was brought
into the [**Location (un) 620**] ED where he was diagnosed with massive,
bilateral pulmonary emboli. He was started on heparin drip after
bolus and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the ED, initial vs were: T
97.7P 91 BP 120/66 R 18 O2 sat 97 % on 2L. Patient was admitted
to the medical intensive care unit.

Past Medical History:
-Prostate Ca s/p external beam radiotherapy 4 years ago
-Temporal Arteritis, diagnosed [**4-/2195**]
-Gout, first attack 3 weeks ago
-Hyperlipidemia
-Hx umbilical hernia repair 3 years ago
-Hx appendectomy at age 11

Social History:
Lives alone. Attorney. Never a regular smoker and no tobacco
during past 3 months. Approximately 1 EtOH beverage/night. No
illicits.

Family History:
Dad w/ CVA. Colon cancer and glaucoma on maternal side. "Heart
Problems" on father's side. Father with history of blood clots,
was on Coumadin.

Microbiology:
.
MRSA screen [**2195-10-30**]: positive
.
EKG [**2195-10-29**]: Sinus arrhythmia. Right bundle-branch block.
Possible inferior myocardial infarction, age indeterminate.
There is an S1-Q3-T3 pattern. Possible pulmonary embolus.
Non-specific T wave changes. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
Imaging:
.
[**2195-11-2**] Thyroid ultrasound: Multinodular thyroid gland with
small nodules, which do not demonstrate any son[**Name (NI) 5326**]
worrisome features. Routine followup is recommended.
.
[**2195-11-1**] Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound: Bilateral deep
venous thrombus definitively involving but not completely
occluding the right popliteal vein and also involving the left
posterior tibial vein in the calf.
.
[**2195-10-30**] Transthoracic echocardiogram - The left atrium is normal
in size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation
jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2195-10-29**] CTA ([**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]) - [**2195-10-29**]. There is extensive
bilateral pulmonary embolism. There is a saddle embolus
involving the main and right and left pulmonary arteries, with
emboli extending into all lobar branches. The right ventricle
appears enlarged, but the chronicity of this finding is unknown.
There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. The aorta is
tortuous. Scattered linear opacities in the dependent basal
portions of the lower lobes are most consistent with
atelectasis. The tracheobronchial tree is patent to segmental
levels. There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary
lymphadenopathy. There is a 1.5 cm solid-appearing nodule with a
coarse calcification arising exophytically from the posterior
inferior aspect of the right thyroid lobe. There is a 3.5 cm
cyst in the imaged portion of the right kidney and a 3.5 cm cyst
in the imaged portion of the left kidney. Other imaged other
abdominal organs are grossly unremarkable in the early phase of
contrast enhancement. Multilevel degenerative changes are
present in the spine. IMPRESSION: 1. MASSIVE BILATERAL PULMONARY
EMBOLISM AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. 2. RIGHT VENTRICULAR ENLARGEMENT OF
UNKNOWN CHRONICITY. GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF MASSIVE PULMONARY
EMBOLISM, THIS FINDINGS IS CONCERNING FOR ACUTE RIGHT HEART
STRAIN. 3. SOLID-APPEARING 1.5 CM RIGHT THYROID NODULE. FURTHER
EVALUATION BY
ULTRASOUND IS RECOMMENDED WHEN THE PATIENT IS STABLE, IF NOT
PERFORMED
PREVIOUSLY.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pulmonary Embolism/Deep venous thrombosis: The patient was
admitted to the medical intensive care unit with extensive
pulmonary embolism and evidence of right heart strain. He was
later found to have bilateral deep venous thrombosis (right
greater than left). Anticoagulation was initiated with IV
heparin. The patient remained stable and was transferred to the
medical floor. On the medical floor, warfarin was started, and
IV heparin was changed to Lovenox. The patient was taught how to
self-administer Lovenox and how to manage his diet while on
Coumadin. The patient will self-administer Lovenox until he has
had a therapeutic INR for 2 days. The patient will follow up
with his primary care physician for management of
anticoagulation, with the first two [**Month/Day/Year **] draws occurring on
[**2195-11-4**] and [**2195-11-6**]. The patient's INR was 1.2 at the of
discharge. The patient was advised to stop his daily aspirin
until his next appointment with his primary care physician and
discuss resuming aspirin at that time.
   The etiology of the patient's PE/DVT was unclear. There was
no recent surgical history. The patient has a family history of
venous thrombosis (father). He has been less mobile than usual
in the setting of gouty flair. The patient has a possible
inflammatory risk factor (temporal arteritis). He also has
history of prostate cancer. The patient is due for colonoscopy.
SPEP/UPEP was ordered while the patient was in the hospital, and
the patient's primary care doctor should follow up on this. The
hypercoagulability work-up will be completed in the
