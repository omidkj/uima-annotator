Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
difficulty speaking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation [**10-8**]

History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 10%),
CHF and pAfib who presented in atrial flutter with severe DOE.
The patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] on [**9-21**] with an acute
CHF exacerbation. He subsequently had a right sided stroke on
[**9-25**] affecting Broca's area. Cardiac MRI showed prior inferior
infarct and global hypokinesis. Discharged on [**9-28**] and seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**10-4**] as an outpatient. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
recommended
TEE cardioversion and
left heart catheterization to investigate CAD with the
possibility of future ICD placement.
.
Pt was readmitted on [**10-8**].  He was in his usual state of health
until 3am that day. His wife found him at 7am on the floor next
to their bed conscious but incoherent. He later stated that he
had gotten up to take medications early this AM and had slipped
onto the floor.  She
notified EMS and he was brought to the ED for evaluation.  He
was
evaluated by Neurology for potential acute treatment for stroke,
but was found to be out of the window for therapy.  He was then
admitted for further evaluation.
.
CT head revealed acute right temporal infarct different from
[**9-25**]. CXR ruled out an acute pulmonary process. He continued to
be severely SOB but denied any chest pain or recent leg edema.
His SOB was not positional and has never occurred before, but
his
wife did report a constant non-productive cough which started
prior to his admission on [**9-21**]. At baseline the patient is able
to climb stairs and ambulate around his house with no SOB (per
wife). When seen on this admission by cardiology, the patient
was
unable to speak due to his tachypnea and had an NG tube in place
as he was unable to take his PO medications. His wife denied
that
he had had any recent illnesses. The patient was given dilt 30
mg
IV in the ED and converted to sinus rhythm with a heart rate
down
to 80's.
.
He was admitted to the neurology service for new stroke, where
he
was stable until the evening of [**10-8**] when he presumably mucous
plugged, became tachypneic and was working very hard to breathe.

He was sent to the ICU for an elective intubation.  Of note,
during his admission he was having jerking movements of his
lower
face that were felt to be myoclonic in nature rather than
seizures.  They were not stopped with IV ativan, but they did
stop once patient was put on a midazolam gtt, which is commonly
the case with myoclonus.  Patient remained intubated so that he
could be paralyzed while an EEG was done to avoid muscle
artifact
on the EEG from his facial movements.  His EEG was negative for
seizure activity.  He was then extubated on [**10-10**] without issue,
although he continued to have difficulty with his secretions. He
was then able to be transferred on [**10-11**] to another serivce to
care for his many complicated medical and cardiac issues.

IMAGING:
CT HEAD [**2164-10-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Cytotoxic edema in the right temporal lobe
concerning for acute
infarction, findings new from prior exam. No hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**2164-10-8**]: IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.
.
REPEAT CT HEAD [**2164-10-8**]: IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of the
early subacute infarction in the right posterior temporal and
parietal lobes, without hemorrhagic transformation.
.
MRI/MRA [**2164-10-8**]: IMPRESSION: New territorial FLAIR signal
abnormality involving the right temporal lobe as well as
discrete cortical FLAIR hyperintensity in the left frontal and
parietal lobe. The areas are not hypointense on ADC maps, but
given the history of prior infarct, their scattered nature,
these lesions likely correspond to subacute embolic infarcts.
There is no evidence of associated hemorrhage and no significant
mass effect.

ECHO [**2164-10-9**]: Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 10 %). There is inferior akinesis, inferolateral
akinesis/dyskinesis and severe hypokinesis elsewhere. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-21**],
mitral regurgitation is now less prominent.

EEG [**2164-10-9**]: IMPRESSION: Abnormal extended routine EEG for most
of the recording due to the very low voltage slow background.
This was not simply sleep but implied a widespread
encephalopathy. In the last minute or so, the background
suggested normal wakefulness. In all sections, there were no
areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform
features.

CXR [**10-11**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
extubated. The nasogastric tube remains in place. Unchanged high
lung
volumes with simultaneous moderate cardiomegaly, but without
evidence of
pulmonary edema. The pre-existing right lower lung parenchymal
opacity with air bronchograms is unchanged. No evidence of
pneumotho
