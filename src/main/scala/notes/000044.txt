Date of Birth:   [**2110-10-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old female
with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2174**] with
a history of five myocardial infarctions, the last in [**2185-7-28**] as well as congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 30%, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  On [**2185-11-11**],
she experienced transient episodes of left arm weakness
associated with slow speech.  Her husband called the
patient's doctor who recommended she present to the emergency
room.

On arrival her vital signs were stable.  Labs were
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were negative initially.  She
was admitted to the Neurology for work up of a question of
TIA or stroke.  She underwent MRI of the head upon admission
that was negative for an acute process.  While on the floor
on [**2185-11-11**], she was noted to become tachycardic in a sinus
rhythm to 150 and was noted to have rales on exam.  She was
given 40 mg of IV Lasix without significant response; she
received a second dose of 40 mg IV Lasix and then a code was
called when she subsequently was noted to drop her oxygen
saturation to the mid 80s on 100% nonrebreather.  She also
became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.

She was intubated and briefly required Dopamine to maintain
her blood pressures.  She was then transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for further management of congestive heart
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2174**].
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 30%.
5.  Alzheimer's dementia.

Her primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1537**].  Her
neurologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Prilosec 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. q.d.
6.  Coreg 6.25 mg p.o. q. AM and 3.125 mg p.o. q. PM.
7.  Colestid with breakfast and supper.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Folate 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Lanoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. Monday, Wednesday and Friday and
0.25 Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Sulfa.
2.  Iodine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not
smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care
Unit, she was intubated and sedated.  She had pink, frothy
sputum suctioned from her G tube.  Her lungs had audible
rales at the bases.  She had a regular rate and rhythm
audible upon precordial exam with no audible extra heart
sounds.  Her abdomen was benign with positive bowel sounds.
She had no edema with 1+ distal pulses.  She was responding
to stimuli, but was sedated.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit had a
sodium 134, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 25, BUN
20, creatinine 0.7, glucose 124, INR 1.1.  White count 7,
hematocrit 33, platelets 211.

EKG normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with a left
axis, left bundle branch block.  There was no comparison
available at the time.

Chest x-ray with patchy vascular markings consistent with
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The initial impression on admission to the
Coronary Care Unit was that the patient was a 75 year-old
female with severe coronary artery disease who developed
symptoms of left arm discomfort on the day prior to
admission.  It may or may not have represented anginal type
symptoms.  She was now admitted directly from the floor in
apparently decompensated congestive heart failure in the
setting of elevated systolic blood pressure (as high as 200).

The patient was able to be weaned off of Dopamine
expeditiously upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit.  She
was diuresed aggressively and successfully with IV Lasix.
She had a PA catheter placed upon admission in order to guide
her management with initial pulmonary artery pressures of
35/10 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10.  Of note,
this was following aggressive diuresis.

The patient did well with subsequent titration up of after
load reduction with Captopril and initiation of Isordil.  She
was able to be extubated successfully on [**2185-11-14**].  She
underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a
severely depressed LV function with ejection fraction of 20
to 30% and akinesis of the inferior row posterior walls and
moderate hypokinesis at the LV as well as 1+ AR and MR.

The patient subsequently did well and at the time of this
dictation on [**2185-11-17**], she is awaiting transfer to the
General Medical Floor where she will await eventual
disposition most likely to short term rehab.

TRANSFER STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Pending.
