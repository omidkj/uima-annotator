Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8810**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
54YO male with multiple myeloma, h/o DVT 2 yrs ago after long
car ride, on coumadin for 8 months and then off, who presented
with syncope, SOB, palpitations and was found to have bilateral
massive PEs on CT. On [**2171-1-29**] pt felt lightheaded, sat down and
then was found on bathroom floor (awoke when wife opened door).
He had sxs of dizziness, SOB, and pounding in his ear, but these
improved. He went to onc appt that afternoon for 3rd injection
of vaccine therapy but was referred to ED for HR 120, BP 144/80,
RR 18 and 88% RA. In ED had CT chest confirming bilateral large
PE and U/S of legs showing bilateral LE clots. He had a STAT
echo that showed RA and RV dilation with global RV HK and
abnormal systolic septal motion.  Patient went to SICU where he
was placed on IV heparin. Patient was hemodynamically stable in
the ICU. He required NC for breathing and this was continued on
transfer to the BMT service.

Past Medical History:
Stage I myeloma not requiring treatment found during hypercoag
work-up. Bone marrow biopsy on [**2168-10-27**] that showed an increased
plasma cell count that was 26% in the aspirate. The plasma cells
were 16% of the nucleated cells of the biopsy.
.
Bone marrow bx [**10-31**]: approximately 30% of the marrow
cellularity is comprised of plasma cells with lambda light chain
restriction. Skeletal survey most recently negative [**10-1**].
.
Started dendritic vaccine trial in [**Month (only) **] and was due for his
third injection yesterday (not given due to PE symptoms-->
referral to ED). Each dendritic cell vaccine accompanied by
three days of growth factor.
.
Beta-2 microglobulin has been stable over two years about 2.7
(most recent [**12-31**]) His Free kappa has been stable at 9.4 and
free lambda stable (elevated) at 600 (most recent [**12-31**]) The
ratio, as expected, is low at 0.2. His UPEP has always been
negative. His SPEP show stable hypogammoglobulin, with his most
recent with IgA=30 (nl 70-400), IgM = 26 (nl 40-230) and IgG
normal at 1061. The percent of monoclonal IgG lamda has been in
the 6-10% range over the past two years, with a slight rise to
the 10% range more recently. Calcium has always been normal.
.
Of note, hypercoagulable workup negative (negative, [**Doctor First Name **], lupus
anti-coagulant, ATIII, protein C, protein S, Factor V Leiden, PT
gene mutation and anti-cardiolipin)
.
PMH:
1. multiple myeloma- currently on dendirtic cell fusion vaccine
therapy
2. DVT 2 years ago, treated with coumadin for 8 months, negative
hypercaog w/u


Social History:
lives with wife and daughter in [**Name (NI) 13588**]
works at [**Name (NI) 1819**], director of service
- TOB
rare ETOH, (-) hx IVDU

Family History:
mother died lung cancer at age 72
father died of CHF, had MI in 50's

Physical Exam:
T: afebrile HR 94-120 155/102 18 96% 2liters
comfortable, no distress
HEENT: NCAT Oropharynx clear
lungs: CTA B/L No wheezing or crackles
heart: +s1+s2 RRR
abd: Soft NTND
ext: R leg chronically larger than the L ; no edema

Pertinent Results:
CT-A:
1. Large extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli. This finding was
relayed immediately to the ED dashboard at the conclusion of the
examination (approximately 1:20 p.m. on [**2171-1-29**]).
2. Right upper lobe subpleural nodule with adjacent pleural
thickening, concerning for carcinoma.
3. Nonspecific nodular opacities within the left lung.
4. Hypodensities within the liver, too small to characterize.
5. Soft tissues structure within the left abdomen adjacent to
the lateral abdominal wall. This could represent a partially
imaged normal structure such as colon or a splenule, but a soft
tissue nodule cannot be excluded given that is not completely
imaged.
.
ECHO:[**2171-1-29**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity  size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There
is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
.
CT Chest/Abd Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tiny, hypoattenuating areas within the right lobe of the
liver which are too small to definitively characterize but
likely represent simple cysts.
2. Enlarged prostate
.
ECHO [**2171-2-1**]: Bubble Study
Limited contrast study was performed at rest with cough and
Valsalva. There  was no evidence of shunt across the interatrial
septum at rest or with  maneuvers.

LENI:
There is thrombosis extending from the right common femoral,
including the origin of the greater saphenous, through the
popliteal vein with non-compressibility and intraluminal
thrombus. On the left side, there is compressibility of the left
common femoral vein, but intraluminal thrombus and lack of
compressibility are present from the mid superficial femoral
vein through the left popliteal. Because of the presence of
these thromboses, augmentation tests were not performed.
- Bilateral DVTs
.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 y.o. male with MM and h/o DVT, treated with coumadin, who
presented with bilateral massive pulmonary emboli.
.
# PE - Large causing compromised respiratory status and right
heart strain
- He was hypoxic to 85-89% with tachycardia on admission to ED.
- Initially admitted to the MICU. Started on heparin with PTT
goal of 60-80. There was no indication for clot lysis at this
time as patient stabilized with regard to his O2 requirements
and his hemodynamic status. He was transferred to the BMT
service. During his time here, he was HD stable and his O2
reuquirements dropped. He was able to start ambulating the
hallways without dyspnea without supplemental oxygen.
- Started on heparin, maintain PTT >70 to finish 5 day overlap
of heparin and coumadin - with goal INR to be therapeutic at
[**3-1**]. Though was only able to achieve INR of 1.6 on day of
discharge. Hence, he was sent home on lovenox at 1mg/kg and his
coumadin was increased to 7.5mg from 5mg. He was also set up
with follow up appointments to monitor his INR.
- Pt's O2 sats remained > 92% throughout his stay on the BMT
service.
.
- Bubble study was negative
.
# Hypercoagulable workup - Usually see tendency to bleed rather
than tendency to clot with MM. Known hypercoaguable
complications from dendritic cell vaccine, although vaccine
given several weeks ago, making this less likely.  Prior
hypercoaguable workup negative.  New RUL nodule incidentaloma
from CTA concerning for malignancy. Liver hypodensities and soft
tissue mass in abdomen also found.
- Abdominal CT with contrast to look for other primary
malignancy was negative
- Repeat hypercoag workup: anti-cardiolipin Ab, PT mutation,
Factor V Leiden, Protein C and S (may not be accurate in setting
of clot)  - to be followed up by outpatient oncologist. ALso, to
check AT 3 once off heparin.
.
- consider bx of lung nodule when acute issues resolve - no
prior CT in our system to compare
.
# Ventriculomegaly - seen on head CT
- Repeat head CT as needed  .
- WIll follow this in future.
.
# PPX: Maintained on heparin and protonix.
.
# Dispo: Because the patient was stable for 4 days on our
service, it was felt that clinically he was sound enough to go
home and reliable enough to use lovenox shots, despite his INR
not being above 2.0. He was instructed how to self administer
the lovenox shots. He also felt better going home rather than
waiting in the hospital for his INR to rise.
