Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Renal artery stent

History of Present Illness:
73 yo F with HTN, CRI, s/p left nephrectomy, right RAS s/p
stenting in [**2111-12-1**], CHF, presented [**8-2**] with worsening dyspnea.
Found to be in CHF in setting of hypertensive emergency. The
renal artery was re-evaluated given high suspicion of
restenosis. Taken for cath on [**8-4**], which revealed 95% right
renal
artery instent restenosis.  The vessel was stented again.
Post-stenting, the pt continued to have elevated BP, and
worsening renal function.  She was thought to have contrast
nephropathy.  Also, she had hct drop noted on [**8-5**] of 30 to 23.
She was given 2U RBCs with bump in cr to 25. She then began
complaining of RUQ pain. MRI/MRA showed large subcapsular
hematoma with active bleeding. Transferred to CCU for closer
monitoring.

stent
.
Renal MRI/MRA ([**2112-8-6**]): Large perinephric hematoma including
mass effect on the lateral aspect of the right kidney. Active
extravasation seen in the course of this exam though not
accumulating at a very brisk rate. No abnormality of the
visualized right renal artery and the extravasation
is quite lateral to any of the extrarenal renal artery branches.
.
Echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 F with right renal artery stenosis s/p stenting complicated
by subcapsular hemorrhage.
.
## CVS:
-Ischemia: Known CAD.
--- Pt was initially only given ASA 81 mg PO as therapy in light
of her capsular hemorrhage post-renal atery stenting.  She was
eventually started back on clopidogrel 75 mg PO qd once the
bleeding ceased.
-Pump: CHF on presentation likely secondary to hypertensive
emergency. Pt was volume overloaded while in the CCU; however,
became she became short of breath due to volume overload only
once.  Because of her volume overload in the setting of oliguric
renal failure, she eventually required dialysis.  She underwent
two sessions of dialysis, and subsequently responded to well
diuresis with furosemide and metolazone.  Pt was started on
daily diuretic therapy since she seemed to consistently develop
LE edema & basilar crackles on lung exam when not recieving
diuretics.
-Valves: No known dz
-Rhythm: no electrical abnormalities. Monitored on telemetry.
.
## Renal: Pt's initial presentation with hypertensive urgency
was attributed to re-stenosis of her renal artery stent.  Even
after PTCA & re-stenting of the renal artery the pt's BP
remained elevated & her renal failure persisted. Her blood
pressure was initially treated in the CCU with a nitro drip.
Then changed to labetalol drip before converting to PO labetalol
and being transfered to the floor.  Multiple agents were
required to lower the pt's BP.  After trying numerous
combinations the following meds seemed to control her pressure
adequately: labetolol, hydralazine, nifedipine, and clonidine
(initially PO then patch).  Since stabilization on these
medications, her SBP has remained mostly <140.  Of note, pt's
oral clonidine was tapered during the transition to the
clonidine patch; however, she should be monitored for rebound
hypertension as the taper has just been completed.
Post-renal artery cath, the pt's renal function became
progressively worse, peaking at a creatinine of 5.7.  She became
uremic.  A tunneled catheter was placed for dialysis, which was
performed twice with good effect.  After dialysis, her Crt began
to trend downward, leveling off at 2.7. Her acute renal failure
was likely multifactorial (hypertensive emergency, dye load, ?
constriction from hematoma).
Her urine output improved after dialysis, though it was still
low.  Because of this and the associated signs of volume
overload, we started her on daily diuretic therapy.
-Pt's potassium was noted to be rising following cath (from 3.3
to 5.1 over two days).  Has improved to 4.7 on loop diuretic.
This needs to be monitored every few days.
.
## ID: Pt was diagnosed with a foley catheter-associated UTI and
treated with 10-day course of ceftriaxone 1 g IV qd because she
has a levofloxacin allergy.  The urine culture revealed
pan-sensitive E. coli.  Repeat urine culture revealed no growth.
 Pt's WBC has been rising slightly.  On, [**2112-8-18**], WBC=12.9.  Pt
has been afebrile.  If WBC continues to rise, she may need a
repeat UCx.  There was no evidence of lower extremity
cellulitis, though there was concern that with her lower
extremity swelling that she might develop this if the skin
breaks.
.
## DM:  Pt was on NPH 7 qAM/7 qPM along with RISS.  Since she
had been requiring an additional 8units of insulin on top of her
NPH at 7qAM/7qPM, we increased her NPH to 14 qAM / 7 qPM upon
discharge.  Her glyburide was held given her renal failure.
.
## Anemia: Pt's anemia was attributed to her sub-capsular
hematoma & also EPO deficiency in the setting of renal failiure.
 She received multiple units of PRBC's to stabilize her Hct.
Overtime, her Hct improved,
