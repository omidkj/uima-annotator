Admission Date:  [**2132-8-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2132-8-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2077-1-21**]       Sex:  F

Service:  General Surgery

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
Ventral hernia and abdominal abscess.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT - Mucous membranes moist, no
ulcers.  Extraocular movements intact.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Sclerae anicteric.  Chest was clear to auscultation in the
superior and middle lobes.  Decreased breath sounds in the
lower lobes.  Cardiac - Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,
no bruits.  Abdomen - Soft, very distended secondary to fluid
edema, positive fluid shift, positive bowel sounds, left
lower quadrant tenderness to palpation that has been constant
since postoperative period.  No rebound tenderness.
Abdominal incision without cellulitis or purulence.  No
hepatosplenomegaly noted.

Extremities - +2 to +3 bipedal edema.  Strength, flexion and
extension [**4-20**] in the lower extremity and [**4-20**] in the upper
extremity, sensation grossly intact to light touch.

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2132-8-19**], white blood cells 6.9, red
blood cells 3.69, hemoglobin 9.7, hematocrit 29.9, and
platelets 187.  Urinalysis performed on [**2132-8-14**] was
negative.  Chemistry performed on [**2132-8-19**] revealed sodium
138, potassium 4.1, chloride 102, BUN 9, creatinine 0.7, and
glucose 192.  Albumin level was not measured.  Calcium 8.4,
magnesium 1.8.  Vancomycin level on [**2132-8-18**], peak 24.6,
trough 10.2.  Arterial blood gases drawn on [**2132-8-15**]
revealed pH 7.41, pCO2 42, pO2 94, total bicarbonate 28, base
axis 1.  Culture of abdominal swab on [**2132-8-14**], Gram's
stain final, wound culture final, Staphylococcus aureus,
coagulase positive, Corynebacterium species diphtheroids.

IMAGING:  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on
[**2132-8-20**].  The impression was significant improvement in
previously seen ventral hernia.  Ileostomy in the right lower
quadrant.  No suspicious collections were seen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**Known firstname 501**] [**Known lastname 107403**] is a 55-year-old female
with past medical history remarkable for multiple ventral
hernia repairs and debridement, status post colectomy, due to
familial polyposis.  She presented to our service on
[**2132-8-14**] for peristomal hernia repair, incision and
drainage of abdominal abscess collection, and abdominoplasty.
The patient underwent laparotomy, extensive lysis of
adhesions, excision of fistula, repair of peristomal hernia,
component separation, incision and drainage of abscess.  No
operative complications were noted, and the patient was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close
monitoring postoperatively.

Since wound abscess culture showed coagulase-positive
Staphylococcus aureus species, Vancomycin was initiated along
with levofloxacin for additional gram-negative coverage.  The
patient was continuously monitored until [**2132-8-18**] in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit and transferred to the floor
where diet was appropriately advanced with return of bowel
function evidenced by ostomy output and gaseous filling.

Hospital course was only remarkable for continued left lower
quadrant residual discomfort which was aggressively pursued
with CT scan due to high probability of a seroma formation.
The CT revealed no evidence of fluid collection.  Since the
patient required one month of intravenous antibiotics and
assistance for mobility, the decision was made to discharge
the patient to a rehabilitation facility where she would be
able to obtain these services.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation facility with
intravenous Vancomycin therapy until [**2132-9-20**] and
levofloxacin therapy until [**2132-8-29**].

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has been scheduled for a follow-up
surgical clinic visit with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on Friday, [**2132-8-29**]
at 10:30 a.m., and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Friday, [**2132-8-29**] at
12:30 p.m.

    inhaled.
2.  Albuterol ipratropium inhaler two puffs q.6 hours.
3.  Diphenhydramine chloride 25 mg p.o. 30 minutes prior to
    Vancomycin administration.

7.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for seven days with final
    dose on [**2132-8-29**].
8.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9.  Percocet one to two tablets q.4-6 hours p.r.n. pain.
10. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Quinapril 10 mg p.o. q.d.

    with the last dose on [**2132-9-20**] with peak and trough to
    be drawn after the third dose administration upon
    arriving at the rehabilitation care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post laparotomy, excision of fistula, extensive lysis
of adhesions, repair of peristomal hernia, component
separation, irrigation and debridement of abscess,
abdominoplasty.
