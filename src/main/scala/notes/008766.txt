Chief Complaint:
Cholelithiasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 yo woman with history of bronchiectasis,
MAC s/p 18 months of treatment, completed 3 months ago, here s/p
ERCP for choledocholithiasis, after prior CCY in [**2186**].  She had
presented to the ED on [**1-14**] with abdominal pain, and discharged
home after 2 sets of negative enzymes and a negative nuclear
stress test.  She continued to have intermittent pain, and saw
her pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] was concerned for pancreatic source, and she
underwent abdominal CT on [**1-25**] which showed a gallstone.  She was
referred for ERCP.
.
She underwent ERCP today, with sphincterotomy, without
complications, although she was nauseated and dizzy/vertigo
after the procedure, and had a new oxygen requirement of 4 L,
with O2 sat of 84%.  She received dilaudid 0.5 mg X 1 , zofran 4
mg IV X 2, haloperidol 0.5 mg IV X 1.
.
At present she feels ill, but cannot point to any specific
symptom.
.
On review of systems, prior to her procedure, she had a cough
for the past 1 week, which she thought was either a cold or
allergies.  It was non-productive with no hemoptysis.  She has
felt more lethargic as well.  She has not had any fevers or
chills, no SOB, no further chest pain, no orthopnea, PND, and
stable baseline LE edema. No recent weight gain or loss, no
urinary symptoms, no constipation with BM yesterday, no rashes.
ROS otherwise reviewed in 6 other systems and negative.

ERCP [**2-10**]:
Normal major papilla
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique
A moderate dilation was seen at the biliary tree.
A filling defect was noted in the common hepatic duct consistent
with stone. Rest of the biliary tree appeared unremarkable.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A single pigment stone was extracted successfully using an
extraction balloon.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
.
CXR, AP [**2-10**]:  final read pending, reviewed by me, chronic lung
disease, no effusions, no obvious new large infiltrates.
.
EKG NSR, 89, nl axis, no acute ischemic changes, ordered and
reviewed by me.

CT CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal areas of pulmonary consolidation, concerning for
an acute
infectious process, likely bacterial pneumonia.
2. Mild bronchiectasis and small airways thickening, unchanged.
3. Interval increase in the size and number of the mediastinal
adenopathy.
4. Bilateral small simple pleural effusions.
5. Extensive coronary arterial calcification.

LENIS:
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler assessment of the
bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and
peroneal veins
was performed. There is normal compressibility, flow and
augmentation.

IMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT.

CXR. PICC PLACEMENT:
FINDINGS: Right PICC terminates within the mid superior vena
cava. Heart
size remains normal. Bilateral multifocal alveolar opacities
persist, with
upper and mid lung predominance. These findings are concerning
for multifocal
pneumonia and show mild interval improvement compared to the
prior study.
Small pleural effusions are not appreciably changed.

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2190-2-16**]):
      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 yo woman with prior history of
bronchiectasis and pulmonary MAC, here s/p ERCP for
choledocholithiasis (with prior CCY), with post-procedure
hypoxia.
.
# Multifocal Pneumonia/HCAP/Hypoxemia: CXR & exam consistent
with multifocal pneumonia.  There was no culture data to guide
antimicrobial therapy; the patient was continued on broad
spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl,
azithromycin.  There was some consideration that pulmonary edema
was also contributing to her hypoxemia.  She had a high oxygen
requirement while she was in the ICU and at one point was on
BiPAP.  She was diuresed approximately 3.5 L, which did not
drastically improve her respiratory status.  A TTE demonstrated
right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis and
moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Normal left ventricular
cavity size and regional/global systolic function.  The patient
was weaned to approximately 2L nasal cannula and her lung exam
improved with IV antibiotics.  It was decided that she would be
committed to an 10 day course of IV antibiotics; a PICC was
placed.  She was unable to produce a sputum sample that was
satisfactory for evaluation for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 6643**] was considered on the
differential.
- She will complete Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Azithromycin through
[**2190-2-22**]
- Nebulizers and wean 02 as able
- Cont chronic inhalers
- Aggressive PT/OT
- Consider periodic lasix as needed.  Goal I/Os even to slightly
negative
.
# Thrush: The patient was noted to develop thrush during her
antibiotic course which was treated with nystatin.  An HIV test
was checked and was NEGATIVE
- Can DC once resolved

#Choledocholithiasis: The patient is now s/p ERCP with stone
removal on [**2190-2-10**].  She
