Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with Chest Pain.  Transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 3583**] with respiratory arrest, CHF, &
NSTEMI.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Cardiac cath with stent placmenent & Valvulopasty
Chest tube placement


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo F with PMH significant for HTN, colon CA, hyperlipidemia,
and CAD who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on the evening of [**7-8**]
with sudden onset CP. On arrival to [**Hospital3 3583**], her SaO2
was found to 79% on room air, and she was intubated. A chest
CT-angiogram was done, which was reportedly negative for
pulmonary embolus. Initial ECG demonstrated a junctional rhythm
with new 2-3mm inferior and anterolateral ST depressions and ST
elevations in AVR and V1. She was given ASA, loaded with plavix,
and started on heparin and integrillin gtt prior to transfer.
In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, her VS were T 95.8F (rectal) to 99.8F, HR 63-80,
BP 100-127/40-50. ECG demonstrated junctional rhythm with HR 60
with persistent lateral ST depressions, but resolving ST
depressions in inferior leads and resolving ST elevations in AVR
and V1. Initial CEs were CK 185(17), tropT 0.63, drawn 6 hours
after onset of symptoms. Other initial labs were significant for
BUN/Cr of 28/1.9, K 2.8, and BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 961**]. CXR demonstrated
hyperinflation with hilar congestion and possible R-sided
consolidation--question of PNA. She received levofloxacin 500mg
IV and blood cultures were sent. She was admitted to CCU for
further management of NSTEMI, CHF and respiratory distress.

Echo [**2128-7-9**]: Ejection Fraction: 45% to 50%
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include anterior hypokinesis with distal
septal akinesis.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic  function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic  valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
minimal to mild mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Cardiovascular-
  STEMI:  Pt found to have NSTEMI with troponin peaking 1.232.
Trigger for MI may have been plaque rupture or, also,
demand-supply mismatch in the setting of possible PNA &
respiratory failure.  Cardiac catheterization on [**2128-7-12**]
revealed normal LMCA, 70-80% calcified stenosis of LAD, small
LCx, and RCA with 90% mid-occlusion.  The RCA was stented with
Sirolimus-eluting stents.  Pt recovered uneventfully from the
cath.  NSTEMI & post-cath therapy included ASA, Plavix, and
heparin gtt.
.
CHF:
Pulmonary edema on admission thought to be due to CHF.  Echo on
[**7-9**] revealed moderate to severe AS (tx'd at cath) and an EF of
45 to 55%.  It appears that pt may have mild CHF.  After
admission, she showed few if any signs of heart failure.
.
A-fib:
Pt monitored on telemetry.  Went into rapid a. fib during
admission.  Underwent D/C cardioversion, which failed to convert
her to NSR.  Multiple meds were equired to slow rate
(amiodarone, metoprolol, and diltiazem).  Her rapid afib seemed
to respond best to the diltiazem & amiodarone.  On these three
medications, she eventually converted into sinus rhythm, which
she has been in for 3 days now.  Since converting into sinus
rhythm, her HR has dropped into the 50's.  Because of this slow
rate, her beta-blocker was d/c'd and her calcium-channel blocker
was continued at lower dose--short acting diltiazem 30mg, three
times a day. The patient was also started on coumadin for the
afib.  However, there was debate over whether the patient should
be on coumadin (given her age, risk factors for a fall, and the
fact that she is already on aspirin & plavix for her cardiac
issues).  After extensive discussion, it was determined to
proceed with coumadin therapy during hospitalizaiton and to
discuss the issue with the patients PCP before discharge;
however, we were unable to contact PCP prior to this discharge.
While on coumadin, the pt had two bouts of uncomplicated,
supratherapeutic INRs.  Becuase of this we eventually, decided
that it would be safer for her to be off coumadin, and tx'd only
with aspirin & plavix.
.
# Aortic Stenosis:
Found to have moderate to sever AS on echo. During cath, the pt
underwent balloon valvuloplasty for AS (valve area
0.7cm2-->0.9cm2), reducing the gradient by 50%.
.
#Respiratory failure: Hypoxic respiratory failure.  Intubated on
[**7-9**]. Failed extubation on [**7-12**], after developing worsening
pulmonary edema.  Successful extubation on [**7-13**], post-cath.
.
#? RLL PNA/infx: afebrile on admission, though CXR suspicious
for PNA. Pt tx'd with azithromycin, ceftriaxone & levofloxacin,
which were d/c'd after concern of pt developing ATN w/ azithro &
CTX and of further prolonging QTc interval.  Pan-cultured,
yielding no evidence of infection.
.
#Pneumothorax: caused during placement of central line.
Resolved with chest tube.
.
#Elevated WBC w/ monocytosis: Noted upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**].
Unclear what baseline white count or differential is.  While WBC
has declined somewhat, it is still elevated,  The differential
has shown persistent monocytosis (>4,000 u/L) along with
promyelocytes and metamyelocytes on peripheral smear. (No blasts
seen on smear.)  Pt seen & elavuated by Hematology/Oncology, who
believes pt likely has a myeloproliferative disorder.  They have
recommended a number of blood tests (including a complete anemia
evaluation and cytogenetic testing).  They will help develop
plan for follow-up care, and are in the process of contacting
the pt's PCP.
.
#Anemia: Pt required multiple transfusions during
hospitalization.  She reportedly has h/o B12 defic, requiring
B12 injections.  Iron studies revealed a nml iron level (88) and
an elevated ferritin (226).  If the pt does have a
myeloproliferative d/o, her anemia may be related to that.
.
#Renal Failure: baseline Creatinine is unknown, though her crt
has settled at 0.9.  It peaked at 2.4, and improved since then.
Exact cause of her ARF is unclear.  It may have been due in part
to a pre-renal state given that she was showing some signs of
CHF.  Medications renally dosed.
.
#Coagulation issues: after pt was started on coumadin for afib,
she developed a supratherapeutic INR.  Coumadin d/c'd because of
pt's risk for fall.
.
#FEN: pt started on tube feeds via NGT while intuba
