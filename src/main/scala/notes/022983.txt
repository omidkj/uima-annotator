CT torso: 1. Parenchymal opacification at the right lower lobe
and, to a lesser extent, the right middle lobe. Possible
narrowing or part opacification of the right lower lobe
bronchus. An underlying mass is not excluded.
2. Right pre-bronchial and pretracheal mild adenopathy.
3. Small right pleural effusion, with adjacent atelectasis at
the right lung base. Minimal left pleural effusion.
4. Lobulated soft tissue in the splenic resection bed could
represent
regenerative residual spleen. Less likely, given history of
renal neoplasm, a local recurrent neoplasm is not excluded. The
appearance is not typical of an acute retroperitoneal hemorhage.

5. Aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta in the subrenal
portion,
increased from prior.
6. Bilateral emphysema.
.
Lateral decubitus: 1. Layering mild-to-moderate right pleural
effusion.
2. The predominant component of the right basal opacification is
the
consolidation which may represent aspiration pneumonia giving
the patient
history, pneumonia in combination with atelectasis giving the
slight right
mediastinal shift.
3. Minimal upper zone vascular redistribution that may represent
mild degree of volume overload.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 M with COPD, s/p bioprosthetic AVR for AS, afib s/p CV who
presents with a community acquired pneumonia
.
# Community acquired pneumonia- With clear consolidation on CXR
in right middle and lower lobe. Patient was started on
Ceftriaxone (for [**8-1**] day course) and Azithromycin (completed 5
day course). Sputum samples were unrevealing, urine legionella
was negative. Given his history of renal cell and colon cancer,
CT torso was performed which showed no malignancy but pleural
effusion on the right side. Patient was continued on albuterol
and ipratropium nebulizers, steroids were not initiated for COPD
exacerbation. Interventional Pulmonary was consulted for
possibility/need of draining his pleural effusion. This was
drained 800ccs and the fluid was transudative, c/w a simple
parapneumonic effusion.  Patient did have an oxygen requirement
of 3-4L nasal cannula in the MICU, etiology unclear. Over time
this improved on the floor and the patient was discharge with
home Oxygen (1-2L) and with home physical therapy.
.
# Melena: GI was consulted in setting of patient not bumping
appropriately to blood transfusions. Given his pulmonary risk
factors and likely need for intubation to be scoped, GI
recommended conservative medical management with normalizing
INR, checking Hpylori antibody, goal Hct >25% and continuing PPI
[**Hospital1 **] intravenously. Patient's HPylori antibody came back
positive. In setting of digoxin, patient was started on Flagyl
and Amoxicillin for two week duration in discussions with
Pharmacy.
.
# Atrial fibrillation - Was supratherapeutic to 8 upon
admission, likely in setting of home coumadin interacting with
his antibiotics. This bumped to 10+ and so patient was treated
with Vitamin K PO. Ultimately, in the setting of slow GI bleed
(melena), patient's INR was normalized so coumadin and heparin
were held. Given his CHADS2 score of 3 and his bioprosthetic
valve, cardiology did not feel there were significant
thromboembolic risks for patient to be normalized briefly in
setting of GI bleed. Patient was not well rate controlled on
Digoxin in setting of held Metoprolol. He would drop his blood
pressures without significant rate control with Diltiazem so
patient was resumed on Lopressor 12.5mg q4hrs with good effect.
His metoprolol was uptitrated  on the floor to his discharge
dosage.
.
# Acute on chronic kidney injury - In setting of volume
depletion that resolved with intravenous fluids.
.
# COPD- not on any nebs as outpatient. Was started on
ipratropium and albuterol nebulizers in house with good effect.
.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Community acquire Pneumonia
GI-bleeding


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent


Discharge Instructions:
You were initially admitted to the ICU with pneumonia for which
you were treated as an inpatient.  This was complicated by fluid
outside your lungs which had to be drained.  Your course was
complicated by GI bleeding which resolved with us stopping your
coumadin.  You were seen by our GI experts who want to see you
as below.
.
Your oxygen has been improving, but we will send you out with
home oxygen, the need for which should resolve as you regain
your strength.
.
You were noted to have high amounts of Thyroid hormone and you
need to be evaluated for this as scheduled below.\
