Hypoxic respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 42893**] is a 30 year old G2P1 woman at 22 wks +2 d
gestation who was transferred from [**Hospital1 189**] with dyspnea and
concern for CHF. Her symptoms began 2-3 days ago suddenly, and
she has had progressive DOE.  She would now get out of breath by
any movement.  She reports orthopnea last night, had to sleep in
a chair, because she felt SOB lying flat.

At [**Hospital1 189**], she was found to have O2 sat of 73% on RA and was
placed on a non-rebreather. Chest x-ray there showed pulmonary
edema raising concern for acute CHF. She was given 20 mg of IV
furosemide, 70 mg of Lovenox, and 5 mg of IV NTG. Troponin there
was negative. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97, HR 86, BP 107/67, RR 24, O2
sat 95% on NRB. She was placed on BIPAP and continued on nitro
gtt for preload reduction. She was briefly taken off of BIPAP
and was noted to have O2 sat 88% on 6L. She had repeat CXR
showing reportedly "fluid". EKG showed SR, no ST changes, + TWI
in III and V1-V3.  Cardiology consult was called and performed
bedside echocardiogram, which revealed preserved EF and normal
systolic function. CTA was ordered to rule out PE.  She was
noted to breathe comfortably on BIPAP but was mildly somnolent
during her ED stay. She did not receive antibiotics as she did
not demonstrate evidence of infection (no fever, chills, sputum,
leukocytosis).  The OBGYN team was consulted and recommended
admission to ICU with verification of due date and prenatal
records. Bedside ultrasound of the uterus showed good fetal
movement. Gas prior to transfer was 7.43/33/138/23.

On the floor, she reports breathing is slightly better.  + cough
but no sputum production.  No pleuritic chest pain but has sharp
pain in her throat when she takes in deep breath.  Also feel
that her hearing is muffled and feels that she hears echos.  Has
mild nausea, no vomiting.  No recent travel or sick contact,
although [**Name2 (NI) 18933**]'s sister has MRSA.  Has not been hiking or been
in standing water.
