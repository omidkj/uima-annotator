platelet count 309,000, sodium 139, potassium 4.8, chloride
101, bicarbonate 29, BUN 22, creatinine 0.7.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preoperative physical examination
revealed the following:  Pulse 68, regular rate and rhythm,
blood pressure 120/50.  HEENT:  Within normal limits.  The
patient has an ulcer on her lower gingiva that she reports
due to new dentures.  Neck is without carotid bruits.  Murmur
or aortic stenosis radiating from the chest.  HEART:  Regular

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken for cardiac
catheterization on [**2197-6-8**].  Cardiac catheterization showed
no significant coronary disease.  In the aortic valve area
0.7 cm squared, mean gradient of 41 mmHg, LVEDP 19.  The
patient did not undergo ventriculogram as her echocardiogram
showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was taken to the operating room with
Dr.  [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**2197-6-9**] for aortic valve replacement
with a 19-mm pericardial valve.  Please see operative note
for further details.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  The
patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilation
on the first postoperative night.  The patient required a
Neo-Synephrine infusion, as well as an insulin infusion, both
of which were weaned off on postoperative day #1.  The
patient was restarted on her oral antihypoglycemics on
postoperative day #2.  Epicardial pacing wires were removed
on postoperative day #3, and the patient was transferred out
of the Intensive Care Unit on [**2197-6-12**].  The patient
remained hemodynamically stable, ambulating with the
Department of Physical Therapy.  It was determined that the
patient would benefit from a rehabilitation stay as the
patient was alone.  The patient was cleared for discharge
[**2197-6-14**].
