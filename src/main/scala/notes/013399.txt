Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4698**] was admitted and taken directly to the operating
room. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed a sternal debridement
with bilateral pectoralis muscle closure of open sternal wound
on the left with a thoracoacromial based flap on the right.
Several JP drains were placed at that time.  Following the
operation, she was immediately extubated and taken to the CSRU
for observation. Medical therapy including intravenous
Vancomycin was resumed. She maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the SDU for continued care and recovery. The
wound and JP drainage was monitor closely. She remained
afebrile. She remained reasonably comfortable but required
Percocet for adequate pain control. Due to a non-functional PICC
line, a new PICC line was placed on [**3-10**]. She remained
in a normal sinus rhythm - no atrial arrhythmias were noted.
Physical therapy was consulted for assistance with strength and
conditioning.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 4698**] had a small amount of wound
separation that was sutured with a total of five 4-O nylon
sutures with good approximation.  On [**2106-3-15**] the plastics
service removed one of three JP drains.  Here remaining JP
drains continued to decrease in output of serosanguinous
drainage.  On POD 8 Mrs [**Known lastname 4698**] was 1kg below her preop weight
with poor exercise tolerance, no SOB, or Chest pain.  Her blood
pressure was stable.  Her sternotomy incision was clean, dry,
and intact without evidence of infection.  She was discharged to
[**Hospital6 459**] in good condition, cardiac diet, sternal
precautions, and instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in one
week and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one to two weeks.
