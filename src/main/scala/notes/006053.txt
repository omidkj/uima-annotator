Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
sob

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
75F with metastatic breast cancer, s/p recent chemo (last on
[**8-19**]), CHF who gradually started to develop SOB 1d after chemo.
Her SOB increased gradually, until the morning of her admission,
when she was SOB @ rest and therefore presented to [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital.
.
At OSH, VS=97.6 97/38  115  22  99%4L NC.  Per report she was
bradycardic and with ?heart block, and received atropine x1.
CXR showed ?new LLL opacity.  Labs revealed ARF (k= 6.0 -> given
calcium, insulin, glucose, kayexalate, no acute EKG changes).  A
R femoral TLC was placed.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation for HD.  En route SBP dropped (no documentation of
SBPs), and pt was started on dopa gtt.
.
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with VS: 97.8  70  106/56 18 96% NRB on
dopamine gtt.  SBP down to 78/38 in ED.  In the ED, given 1U
PRBC, 1L IVF NS. Her O2 requirement was weaned down to 6L, she
was mentating appropriately per report.  She was admitted to
MICU [**1-9**] hypotension.

Pertinent Results:
[**2122-8-23**] CXR: bibasilar opacities, which may represent
atelectasis or
pneumonia.  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**2122-8-23**] EKG: sinus bradycardia.
.
CT head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, shift
of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. There are small
subinsular white matter lucencies suggesting chronic ischemia.
[**Doctor Last Name **]- white matter differentiation appears grossly preserved.
Visualized paranasal sinuses appear normally aerated.
IMPRESSION: Subinsular lacunes. Otherwise normal study. MRI with
gadolinium is more sensitive in the evaluation for metastases.
.
Ultrasound:
FINDINGS: Portable bedside evaluation was performed with
limitations secondary to patient respirations.
An approximately 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.5 cm iso- to hypoechoic lesion is
present within segment VIII of the liver. No other focal hepatic
lesion is identified and a previously noted cyst within segment
[**Doctor First Name 690**] is not adequately seen. There is no intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation, the patient is status post cholecystectomy.
The right kidney measures 9.7 cm. The left kidney measures 9.8
cm. No hydronephrosis, stone, or renal mass is identified. The
pancreas is poorly evaluated. The abdominal aorta is normal
caliber throughout and demonstrates scattered mural
atherosclerotic calcification. Spleen appears unremarkable. A
left-sided pleural effusion is partially imaged.
Doppler interrogation of the liver demonstrates patent hepatic
and portal vessels. Flow within the main portal vein is
hepatopetal. The main hepatic artery demonstrates a waveform
within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:
1. Solid-appearing segment VIII hepatic lesion is a nonspecific
finding but may represent a metastasis.
2. Patent portal and hepatic veins.
3. Left pleural effusion.
.
CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma, hydronephrosis or
pathologic lymph node enlargement.
2. Two hypodense hepatic lesions, one of which is compatible
with a cyst and the other of which cannot be definitively
characterized but could represent a hepatic metastatic focus.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, the left of which is loculated
and incompletely imaged.
4. Peripancreatic fat stranding which may be related to anasarca
given the patient's recent normal lipase value.
5. Multiple osseous metastases, as detailed above.
.
Echo:The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT chest: 1. Bilateral small-to-moderate sized partially
loculated pleural effusions. Given the history the suspicion for
malignant pleural invasion is high, especially given thick
nodular soft tissue enhancement within the pleural effusions on
the prior abdomen CT (not evaluated today due to absence of
contrast).
2. Innumerable skeletal metastases.
3. Peripheral ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes
bilaterally; considerations include infectious of inflammatory
process; less likely would be metastases.
4. Two hypodense liver lesions, incompletely characterized,
concerning for metastatic foci.
.
CXR [**8-28**]:
New bilateral perihilar opacities extending towards the lower
lobes representing new pulmonary edema. The previously seen
right lower lobe opacity related to pleural effusion is changed
in appearance most likely due to currently supine position of
the patient. The cardiac silhouette has been markedly enlarged
in the meantime interval, which may be corresponding to both
changing of the patient's position and its hemodynamic status.
The left internal jugular line tip terminates at the junction of
the brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
IMPRESSION:
1. New pulmonary edema.
2. Increased heart size.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 F with metastatic breast ca, paroxysmal AFIB with RVR, with
resolved neutropenia after chemo, resolved heart block while in
ARF on atenolol.
.
# Hypotension and sinus bradycardia:
She arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] on dopamine gtt, started en route in life
flight (no documentation). Initial concern was for sepsis vs
volume vs volume loss (hct=23, baseline unclear, was 28 at OSH),
concerning for GIB given guaic+ in ED vs RP bleed given femoral
access at OSH vs tamponade (uremic, coagulopathic, and h/o
breast malignancy) vs atenolol toxicity in setting of ARF [**1-9**]
chemotherapy. CT abd/PELVIS was negative for retroperitoneal
bleed.  Pt was transfused with PRBC with slowly responding HCT.
Cardiology consult was obtained given concern for tamponade,
pulsus was initially [**7-17**], +pericardial knock. TTE was negative
for tamponade, grossly normal EF, ?RV dilation. Given concern
for GI bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and ARF, as well as rapidly
improving O2 status, PE was felt less likely, and heparin gtt
was not started. She was weaned from dopamine gtt gradually over
~2d, though was found to be acutely sensitive to weaning with
periods of bradycardia to 20s (including 1.5-4 second pauses)
while weaning, these episodes were asymptomatic. Bradycardia
resolved over several days.
.
# Hypoxemia:
On presentation, etiology was felt likely [**1-9**] pulmonary edema
from ARF, however given neutropenia, concerning for PNA.
PaO2/FiO2 gradient = 90 / 0.40 = 360.  no effusion seen on
bedside TTE.  given hypotension, diuresis was deferred. Since
she was afebrile but neutropenic, she was treated empirically
with cefepime/vanco.  pt was seen
