Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure-like activity; hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
77 year old man with IPF on 6L home O2, A fib on Coumadin s/p
ablation, systolic CHF s/p PPM w/ [**Hospital 26418**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
hospital following a witnessed seizure at home. Referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for seizure, supratherapeutic INR. Admitted to the ICU for
hypoxia.
.
Pt states this morning he awoke at 4:30am with some
lightheadedness and air hunger. He was walking from bed when he
suddenly felt the sensation of falling, he thinks he tripped
over his O2 cord but cannot remember. He does remember hearing
himself fall on the ground. His daughter heard him fall and ran
to his bedroom and noticed the pt was on the floor. His eyes
were rolled up into his head, he was shaking in his arms and his
legs. He had urinary incontinence, per the daughter they could
not feel a pulse but didnt do CPR. After about 3-4mins he
regained conciousness and was initially disorientated for a few
seconds. He remembers waking up and seeing his daughter, when
his daughter told him they called EMS he asked to be sat up.
.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 16673**], per ED report he had a CT Head which
showed no acute intracranial bld, labs were significant for an
INR 6. He was noted to have a HA and was given 0.5mg IV
Dilaudid. Vit K 2.5 PO x 1. Unfortunately no records were found
from [**Hospital3 16673**]. He was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for his
seizures and elevated INR.
.
In the ED initial VS were noted to be T97.9, HR 70, BP 120/70,
RR 20, Sat 94% on 6L. Labwork was notable for neutrophillic
leukocytosis 14.4 (80N, L11), Hgb/Hct 14.8/43.1, plt 205. Chem
panel was unremarkable, ALT elevated at 58, AST 20. Trop 0.03,
Coags showed INR 9.3, PT 80.7, PTT 35.8. U/A was also obtained
which showed small amount of leuks, 9 WBCs, few bacteria, 2
epis. He was given Vit K 10mg x 1 for his elevated INR.
Neurology were also consulted to determine whether this was a
seizure, their conclusion is seizure vs convulsions s/p syncope.
They also repeated his CT head scan which showed no evidence of
an acute bld. In the ED he was noted to have some episodes of
hypoxia to the high 70s with minimal activity which appears to
be his baseline on review of his last pulmonary note. Per ED
signout he was saturating mid 90s on 6L (his new baseline O2
requirement). they also noted BPs in the 90s-100s with one
[**Location (un) 1131**] reportedly 80/60 which resolved without any
intervention. It is unclear as to why the pt was given
[**Name (NI) 39915**] 1gm, likely given the hypoxia and CXR which appears
to be close to baseline. He was also given Bactrim for his UTI,
although pt has been on Bactrim for ppx whilst on Prednisone.
.
Prior to transfer to the unit VS were HR 74. 99/78, 23, 94% on
6L.
.
Of note pt is usually followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
On review of the last pulmonary note it appears Mr. [**Known lastname 10132**] [**Last Name (Titles) 39916**]y status had a remarkable decline from 2L of O2 in
[**Month (only) 958**] to 6L with very little reserve for activity in [**Month (only) 116**]. The
decline was thought to be either due to accelerated IPF vs
amiodarone lung toxicity and a component of CHF. His Prednisone
was increased to 60mg daily with NAC. The pt also underwent a
cardiac catheterization given this question of biventricular
failure and chest pain. Cath showed severe native three vessel
coronary artery disease, LMCA showed mild luminal
irregularities, LAD was totally occluded in the mid vessel, LCx
was occluded proximally, RCA was also totally occluded. He had a
widely patent LIMA->LAD w/ large/long intercostal branch off of
the mid LIMA and may represent steal from the LIMA to the LAD.
The SVG->RI was widely patent as was the SVG->PDA. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right ventricular filling
pressures, RVEDP of 8mmHG. Mild left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction, with a mean PCWP of 18mmHg. Moderate pul HTN with a
PASP of 51mmHg.
.
On [**2189-6-2**] he underwent a biventricular pacer placement with
AICD, and ablation. On review of the procedure note following
ablation the pt went into CHB with the pacer picking up at
50bpm. His pacer is [**Name6 (MD) 39917**] [**Name8 (MD) 39918**] CRT-P C2TR01, set to DDD at
a rate of 70 bpm.
.
ROS: He denies any nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, has chronic
cough for months which is thinning in terms of sputum production
per pt, no hemoptysis, no rhinorrhea, phayngitis, diarrhea,
constipation, weakness/numbness in extremities.
