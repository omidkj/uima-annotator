ADDENDUM:  The patient's main issue since the last discharge
summary are as follows.  The patient was transferred to the

stay, the patient continued to spike intermittent

As per Infectious Disease, the patient eventually defervesced
and the antibiotics were stopped per Infectious Disease's
initial consult recommendation of ten days of antibiotic
coverage empirically.

The patient remained afebrile after stopping the antibiotics
and subsequently had no more fevers.  The patient also
tolerated having his Foley removed, and voided spontaneously
on his own.

The patient's main issues in the days prior to discharge
remained with his anticoagulation balance, with a goal INR
being about 2.0 for his history of pulmonary emboli.  In
addition, the patient had some sacral decubitus ulcers which

The patient on the day of discharge continued to be afebrile,
tolerating a regular diet, and quite comfortable.  He had no
acute issues and his INR on the day prior to discharge was
