CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 64-year-old gentleman with a
history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes
mellitus, coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction, congestive heart failure, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, status post DDI pacer
for third-degree heart and with a history of syncope with
most recent admission in [**2102-5-22**] with nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia on pacer.  The patient was
transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital following an episode of
syncope.

According to the patient, about one week prior to admission
he had his DDI pacer evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was told
that there were no problems.   On the morning of admission he
was in his usual state of health when at about 2:30 in the
afternoon he was walking up the stairs carrying some
groceries when he developed severe shortness of breath.  He
attempted to sit down but lost consciousness.  His wife
reports that she heard a thud as he fell, and when she
arrived on the scene he was lying in a pool of blood from a
head laceration.  She was unable to find a pulse and
therefore began CPR.  Emergency medical service was then
called.  A total of about two minutes of CPR were performed
on the patient when he spontaneously awakened.  When
emergency medical service arrived at the scene he reportedly
was sleepy but denied chest pain and shortness of breath.  He
was experiencing some nausea and confusion.

At [**Hospital **] Hospital the patient had a head CT which ruled out
an acute process, and he had his left forehead laceration
repaired and then was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**].

Per the patient, he had a similar episode in [**2102-5-22**] when
he was walking in the yard, experienced shortness of breath
and then collapsed.  When emergency medical service was
called he had a heart rate of 70 and a blood pressure
of 110/60.  His pacemaker was interrogated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
that time which showed short runs of ventricular tachycardia;
however, not consistent with the time of the patient's
syncopal episode.  The electrophysiology service was
consulted at that time; however, secondary to concerns about
the patient's pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and
concern about terminating any ventricular tachycardia that
was induced, an electrophysiology study was not performed.
The patient did have a cardiac catheterization in [**2102-5-22**]
which showed 50% left anterior descending artery lesion, 90%
diagonal, and 60% left circumflex at the D2 ostium.  There
was no intervention performed.  The patient has severe
pulmonary hypertension but without evidence of right
ventricular failure.  Of note, previous workups have revealed
the patient has restrictive lung disease and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy status post a nondiagnostic biopsy.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient denies
fever, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, edema.
He does have stable three-pillow orthopnea but no paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  He has no headaches or vision changes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Diabetes mellitus.
 2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2086**] which was complicated by pericarditis and
left ventricular thrombus.  Cardiac catheterization from [**2102-5-22**] showed normal right-sided pressures, mildly elevated
left-sided pressures, wedge pressure of 14, and left
ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 14.  It also showed
severe pulmonary hypertension of 90/60 and mild aortic
stenosis.  Please see history of present illness for
angiography results.
 5.  Congestive heart failure with echocardiogram from
[**2102-2-21**] showing an ejection fraction of 25%, a
dyskinetic apex, anterior and anteroseptal akinesis.  It also
showed a dilated right ventricle with free wall hypokinesis.
 6.  Third-degree heart block, status post DDI pacer.
 7.  Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, status post nondiagnostic
biopsy.
 8.  Pulmonary hypertension.
 9.  Restrictive lung disease with pulmonary function tests
from [**2102-3-13**], showing an FVC of 45%, and FEV1
of 44% of predicted, a total lung capacity of 59% of
predicted, a DLCO of 69% of predicted, and an FEV1:FVC ratio
of 99%.
10.  Status post cataracts.
11.  Syncope in [**2102-5-22**] with nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia on pacer monitor.

ALLERGIES:  DEMEROL which causes hypotension, FENTANYL which
causes nausea, SERAX which causes mental status changes, and
NEURONTIN.

FAMILY HISTORY:   His mother died at 91 of old age and
diabetes.  His father died of motor vehicle accident.  No
family history of coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a former tobacco smoker, quit 30 years
ago.  Minimal alcohol.  He is a retired accountant.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were afebrile, heart
rate 63, blood pressure 126/51, respiratory rate 12, satting
98% on room air.  In general, this was a thin, elderly
gentleman in no acute distress.  His HEENT examination was
remarkable for a left forehead dressing which was clean, dry
and intact.  Otherwise, head was normocephalic and
atraumatic.  He had an eccentric left pupil, but pupils were
equally reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were
intact.  His oropharynx was clear.  His neck had no jugular
venous distention and no bruits.  His lung examination was
remarkable for bilateral rales two-thirds of the way up.  On
cardiac examination, the patient had a hyperdynamic
precordium with laterally displaced point of maximal impulse.
His heart was regular with a [**3-27**] high pitched late peaking
systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border which
radiated to the carotids.  His abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  His rectal examination was guaiac
negative.  He had no femoral bruits.  He had 2+ dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.  Extremities
had no edema.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves
II through XII were grossly intact.  He had 5/5 strength.
His reflexes were symmetric bilaterally, and he had normal
sensation.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 5.2, with a normal
differential.  Hematocrit 49, platelets 153.  Chem-7 was
sodium 139, potassium 5.1, chloride 105, bicarbonate 24,
BUN 30, creatinine 1.2, blood sugars 277.  Calcium 8.9.
CPKs were 77, 75, 87, and 74.

EKG showed AV pacing at 60 with left axis and a left bundle
pattern.  Unchanged from [**2102-5-16**].

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly without significant failure
or infiltrate.

Head CT was negative per report.  Cervical spine was negative
per report from outside hospital.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 64-year-old man with diabetes,
coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, congestive
heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, status post DDI pacer
for complete heart block, who presented with recurrent
syncope, known unrelated ventricular arrhythmia.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient presented with recurrent
syncope.  He has been evaluated for this in the past and
found to have unrelated ventricular tachycardia.  Previously,
electrophysiology had been reluctant to study the patient
given his risk factors of pulmonary hypertension and
cardiomyopathy.  His pacer was interrogated on admission and
the patient was once again found to have runs of ventricular
tachycardia but unrelated to the time of his syncopal
episode.  He was ruled out for myocardial infarction and
after some discussion with the electrophysiology service, it
was felt that the patient's syncope was most likely secondary
to increased pulmonary artery pressu
