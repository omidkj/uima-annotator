representing atelectasis.
3. Small perihepatic fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13290**] operative course was complicated by difficult
intubation, decreased oxygen saturations, bradycardia, and
hypotension. He was stabilized with successful intubation, and
IV hydration. His surgery was completed, and he ws transferred
to ICU for further management.
.
POD1-He was extubated in the ICU in the morning, & monitored
closely. He was weaned to 4L of nasal cannula with sats>95%. He
appeared stable, and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **].
.
RESP:He had audible bibasilar crackles post-op. He was diuresed
with IV Lasix, and responded with decreased demand in oxygen via
nasal cannula. He required more time to wean from oxygen. His
sats are currently 92% on RA. Pulmonary Team was consulted who
recommended PFT's on outpatient basis and sleep studies to rule
out sleep apnea. Recommendations also included daily diuresis,
BNP>1200, Spiriva/albuterol/atrovent and aggressive IS
use/CPT/and frequent ambulation. He was taught proper use of
MDI's. Smoker cessation was offered. Patient made it clear he
had no intention of quitting. His [**Last Name (LF) 802**], [**Name (NI) **], will make a
follow-up appointment for PFT's on outpatient basis.
.
ABD:His abdomen is large, soft, NT/ND with active bowel sounds.
His abdominal incision is OTA with staples with a small amount
of erythema along the incision line. He was started on IV
cephazolin, and switched to PO Augmentin due to reports of GI
upset with PO Keflex in the past. He will have the staples
removed at the follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
NUT:He was NPO post-op. His diet was advanced as his bowel
function resumed. He has been tolerating a regular diet without
complaints of nausea and/or vomiting.
.
ELIM:He had a foley catheter inserted intra-op. The catheter was
removed, and he was able to urinate without difficulty. He
reports passing flatus, but has not had a bowel movement since
surgery.
.
PAIN:His pain was managed with an IV PCA post-op. He was
advanced to oral Percocet once tolerating oral fluids. He
reports her pain 0-2/10 at rest, and increases to [**5-31**] with
activity which is well tolerated. He will be discharged with a 2
week supply of percocet, and colace to prevent constipation.
.
He reports not having a current PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] does not have interest
inestablishing a relationship with a family physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
encouraged to follow-up with Pulmonology, and to consider
finding a PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will be discharged home with VNA services for
assessment of respiratory status.
