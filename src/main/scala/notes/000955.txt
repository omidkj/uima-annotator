Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4854**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypotension, afib with RVR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
redo LUE AV fistula & replacement R SCV tunneled HD


History of Present Illness:
56 yo male, h/o ESRD [**2-5**] anti-GBM disease, on HD, DM2, HTN, p/w
fevers s/p HD session.  Pt was reportedly dialyzed today; HD was
almost completed but had to be stopped early secondary to
clotting in the fistula.  Pt/wife stated that he had felt unwell
since dialysis session on Monday (2 days prior to admission).
At this time, he was having some bilateral shaking of his arms.
He also reports some pain in his right shoulder, above the site
of his HD catheter.  He states that this was worse with
movement.  He had 1 episode of loose stools 1 day PTA.  He
denies any URI symptoms, no CP/SOB/abdominal pain.  After HD
session on day of admission, he felt unwell/lethargic at home.
He had some more episodes of shaking/rigors.  He took a nap, and
after awaking from this, had a fever to 104.  At this time, his
wife brought him to the [**Name (NI) **].
.
On presentation to the ED, he was febrile to 103.9; HR was
initially in the 90s with SBP=130.  He subsequently went into
afib with a ventricular response 150-170s, with SBPs as low as
40-50.  In the ED, he received 3 L NS (CVP from [**9-18**]; max).  He
was seen by renal who felt that this was likely septic shock,
recommended vanco/gent.  Renal stated that HD catheter (right
SC) should be used for fluids/pressors/abx (pt has history of
difficult access, ?saving femoral sites for future HD
catheters).  As his SBP did not significantly improve with IVF,
he was started on dopa gtt with some improvement in SBP but
?exacerbation of tachycardia.  Bedside TTE showed no pericardial
effusion or signs of tamponade.  He was reportedly mentating
well throughout ED course.  Other ED events include treatment of
hyperkalemia (7.1 to 4.6) with bicarb, D50.  On presentation to
the ICU, he remained hypotensive, in afib with RVR, was
mentating adequately.  He had no specific complaints but did
state that he was having pain in right shoulder at site of HD
catheter.
