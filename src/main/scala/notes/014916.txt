Brief Hospital Course:
89 year-old male with a past medical history of bioprosthetic
AVR, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure who
presented with a hypersensitivity drug reaction to Bactrim,
whose airway was never compromised, was observed in the ICU
overnight and then called out for further management of [**Last Name (un) **].
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
.
#. Hypersensitivity reaction: The working diagnosis at the time
of discharge was that the patient's reaction was to Bactrim.
Lisinopril was considered, but the cutaneous skin manifestations
were inconsistent with angioedema. Lasix was also considered,
but the patient had been stable on this regimen for weeks prior.
He received decadron at the OSH and on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU
showed no evidence of airway compromise with EGD showing no
laryngeal edema. The patient was observed overnight in the ICU
and transferred to the floor. Discharged with an Epi-Pen Rx and
received training on how to use it by MD.
.
# RASH: There were never signs of TEN or SJS. Dermatology
recommended clobetasol 0.05% ointment [**Hospital1 **] to affected areas of
body for up to 3 weeks, avoiding face, axillae, groin,
intertriginous folds, hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment [**Hospital1 **] to
affected areas of face, axillae, groin, intertriginous folds for
up to 3 weeks, atarax 25mg po q6hr prn pruritus. Discharged on
this regimen.
.
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: In light of its rare cross
reactivity with Bactrim, Lasix was held; the patient was given
ethacrynic acid in the ICU to which he had marked urine output
and thereafter further diuresis was held. Discharged on Lasix
with instructions not to take the medication until he was in the
presence of his PCP with an [**Name9 (PRE) 88759**] in hand.
.
# Pre-Renal Acute Kidney Injury, Chronic Renal Insufficiency:
Baseline Cr was presumed 1.3-1.6. The patient presented to the
floor with a Cr above this baseline due to overdiuresis as
above; Cr showed a trend toward normalization off diuretics.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Hypertension, HL: Continued aspirin, statin, beta blocker.
Lisinopril was held, with plans for the PCP to restart this
medication at her discretion.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Lasix to be restarted by PCP at her discretion.
# Lisinopril to be restarted by PCP at her discretion.
