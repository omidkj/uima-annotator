History of Present Illness:
67 y/o M from nursing home at [**Hospital6 1643**] Center with
H/O Parkinson's disease, CRF, BPH, Aspiration pneumonia, G-tube,
esophagitis. Story of recent febrile illness with respiratory
symptoms treated for 2 days with Azithromycin. On day of
admission was noted by staff to be non-verbal and responsive to
pain only. EMS was called, per EMS report patient was found
agitative and combative, warm and dry, with tachypnea to the
30's, audible upper airway congestion and scattered ronchi, with

to the ED on Ambu bag.
.

ambu. Patient was intubated and ventilated, RIJ was placed, BP's
went down to 70/30 with CVP of 6. CVP was 16 with 5th L hanging
and BPs 80s/50s so Levophed was started. CXR was notable for
bilateral LL infiltrates especially impressive on the right.
Labs were notable for leukopenia WBC 2.1, 83% neutrophils,
lactate of 2.7, Cr: BUN 2.0:60 (from 1.2:26 at baseline),
Cefepim + Vanco were given. In the ED recieved total of 7 L NS.
Transfer vitals were T100.8 PR HR 74 88/50 RR 26 O2 99%, ABG was

IMAGING:
CXR [**2108-2-13**]: IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic study. There are
extensive bilateral basilar opacities, which presumably in the
acute setting may represent aspiration and/or pneumonia with
edema less likely. Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.
.
HEAD CT [**2108-2-14**]: IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process. Mild maxillary and sphenoidal
sinus disease.

CT CHEST abdomen/pelvis [**2-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism, or acute aortic injury.
2. No abnormal fluid collections at the lung bases, or in the
upper abdomen.
3. Multifocal tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and ground-glass opacities
and areas of consolidation concerning for multifocal pneumonia,
likely in the setting of aspiration. Mediastinal lymph nodes,
likely reactive due to current infection.
4. Air in the hilum of an atrophic left kidney. While this could
be due to emphysematous pyelonephritis, air introduced
iatrogenically either by Foley or other instrumentation is
possible. This was further evaluated on a CT abdomen performed
[**2108-2-21**].

KUB [**2108-2-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No sign of obstruction. Air-filled large bowel with minimal
stool.
2. Radio-opaque density projecting over the stomach is of
uncertain etiology but metallic density newly appeared on
[**2108-2-20**]. This could potentially represent an ingested foreign
body.

RUQ U/S [**2108-2-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited right upper quadrant examination with
nondistended
gallbladder and no son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of cholecystitis. No
intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
.
CXR [**2-28**]-HISTORY: Possible foreign body over stomach. In
comparison with study of [**2-27**], the metallic opacification is
again seen just medial to the region of the stomach. This is
consistent with a gunshot fragment.
Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to evaluate the
heart and lungs. The endotracheal tube has been removed.
.
[**3-1**] CXR-FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is no relevant change. Decreasing right lower lobe opacity.
Unchanged left lower lobe opacity. Unchanged position of the
pacemakers. In the interval, the patient has been extubated.
Metallic particle projecting over the stomach.
