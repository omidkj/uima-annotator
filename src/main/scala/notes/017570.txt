Discharge Labs:

Studies:
CXR ([**2149-9-26**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate pulmonary edema. 2.
Increased size of moderate right and small left pleural
effusions. 3. Bibasilar airspace opacities which could reflect
atelectasis though infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.
4. Large hiatal hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of TB s/p treatment, bronchiectasis,
untreated MAC (diagnosed [**6-/2149**]), atrial fibrillation who
presented with worsening shortness of breath, CXR concerning for
bilateral lower lobe opacification with possible peripneumonic
effusion.
.
Active issues:
.
#SOB/Cough: Upon admission, the patient described an increasing
oxygen requirement for the past few days without fever, and with
no evidence of leukocytosis.  At that time, she demonstrated no
signs of volume overload and her CXR was thought to be due to
untreated MAC infection.  However, overnight, she desaturated
down to the low 80%, required 10L on a non-rebreather to
maintain her oxygen saturation, and was thought to be volume
overloaded with evidence of pulmonary edema on her subsequent
CXR. She was subsequently transferred to the MICU for BIPAP
given her worsening oxygen requirement. In the ICU the family
decided to make the patient CMO wo continuation of lasix, abx,
or other non-comfort medications (inhalers, bowel regimen, and
beta blocker continued). Her geriatrician from the NH arranged
for dispo back to the NH with hospice services under new code
status on [**2149-9-29**].
