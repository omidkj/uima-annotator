Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the trauma surgery service.  Her c-spine was
cleared clinically on hospital day 2 after a negative CT scan.
She was initially kept on log roll and the spine service was
consulted due to a question of acute T2 compression fracture.
This fracture was determined to be stable and subacute, and the
spine service did not feel that she required a brace or log roll
precautions.

Her rib pain was controlled initially with oral and IV
medication, but the pain service was consulted for placement of
an epidural catheter for optimizing pain control. An oral pain
regimen was also recommended. She was encouraged to use her IS
frequently but had difficulty breathing deeply.

She became febrile on [**1-29**]; chest xray showed a new
consolidation in the RLL.  She was started on vancomycin and
cefepime to treat a presumed pneumonia. On the morning of [**1-30**]
she was found to be very lethargic and not responsive to voice.
She gradually became more awake, but was confused for
approximately 20 minutes.  She became gradually more lucid
within next 30 minutes. At the time of the event she was being
evaluated by Neurology who felt that she was likely having
seizure activity. On [**1-31**] after having witnessed seizure  with
subsequent hypotension she was transferred to the TICU.  She was
noted with two other seizure events in the ICU, also with
associated hypotension.  Neurology recommended 48 hr EEG
monitoring and an MRI of the head, and she was started on
Keppra.  Her MRI was negative for any focal abnormality.  She
stabilized after some fluid and short period of time on
phenylephrine.

On [**2-2**] after remaining hemodynamically stable for 24 hours she
was transferred back to the regular nursing unit. Neurology
determined that these seizures were associated with
encephalopathy related to head trauma, hyponatremia, opioids,
and pneumonia. It is being recommended that Keppra 750 mg be
continued twice daily for 6 weeks to prevent any further seizure
activity.

She was also noted with [**Location (un) 2452**] colored loose stool while being
treated for her pneumonia with IV antibiotic therapy. The stool
was sent for C-Diff which was negative X3 however, based on
clinical assessment she was started on a course of IV Flagyl for
a total of 7 days. After initiation of treatment it was noted
that the amount and appearance of stool showed improvement.

She was evaluated by physical therapy and she is being
recommended for rehabilitation stay after her acute hospital
stay. Social work met with patient given her +EtOH toxicology
screen on admission to provide counseling on alcohol use and
risks for trauma.
