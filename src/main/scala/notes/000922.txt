Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
painful foot

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
peripheral catheterization x 2

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with severe PVD s/p multiple interventions,
CKD and DM presents to ED with bilateral leg pain worse on left.
Patient states the onset was acute on the day of admission. In
the ED, her left lower extremity was noted to be cold and
pulseless for whcih she was started on Heparin gtt.

As per [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] admission note: Pt last  admited 3 months prior for
similar symptoms; she was taken urgently to cath lab where she
was found to have TO of proximal  LSFA. Thrombectomy of LSFA
without restoration of flow so TPT and  peroneal were
subsequently stented. However, several days later  she
complained of episodes of worsened left leg and foot pain.
Intervention at that time included angioplasty to TPT plaque and
 thrombectomy of the SFA. Final angiography demonstrated
improved  flow, with 10-20% residual stenosis in the SFA and
TPT. The patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge with
good blood flow to her LLE evident on exam.
.
As documented in our prior admit note, pt has been doing well
since discharge. Morning of admission while standing  doing
chores had abrupt unset bilateral LE pain up to her knees.  It
lasted several hours and slowly resolved on its own. Has not
had pain like this in the past. Denied any chest pain,
palpitations or dyspnea. Believes her left foot might be a bit
colder then normal. States that her son looked at her legs a few
days prior and said they looked good. Denies any parathesia or
anesthesia. At baseline, able to ambulate around the apt without
much difficulty. Denies classic caludication symptoms but states
 that her legs get tired with walking and then get better with
rest. Able to lie flat at night without SOB or leg pain. Pt
denies any ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On review of symptoms, she denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
 time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red  stools. She did have extensive echymosis with her last
infuison  of heparin. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. All of  the other review of systems were negative as not
mentioned above.
.
Admitted to [**Wardname 5010**] Service and underwent LE angiography in AM
which showed Left lower extremity - CFA was normal. The SFA
(left) occluded at the level of stents. The distal vessel has a
PA and distal PT at the foot. The AT was occluded. The distal
vessel was crossed into the PA and baloon angioplasty of the PA
was done. The flow in the PA was improved with the SFA still
ocludded with noted thormbus.


Past Medical History:
# Peripheral Vascular Disease-
[**4-/2181**] occluded stents in the LSFA, occluded trifurcation. The

LSFA stented. PTCA was performed on the L PT and the L lateral
tarsal at that time.

successful PTCA/PCI of L SFA.
[**9-27**]: LSFA stenting of instent restenosis
[**10-28**]: RSFA stenting
[**11-27**]: thrombectomy of LSFA without restoration of flow. TPT and

peroneal stented. Repeat angiography with angioplasty to TPT
plaque and thrombectomy of the SFA. Final angiography
demonstrated improved flow, with 10-20% residual stenosis in the

SFA and TPT.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.

of the right thigh.

3. Large right-sided pleural effusion. Moderate left pleural
effusion. These measure relatively high attenuation, and
hemorrhage cannot be excluded. Associated atelectasis, with near
complete collapse of the right lower lobe noted.

imaging recommended to document resolution or stability.

5. Single posterior mid-right renal lesion does not meet CT
criteria for simple cyst.
.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to large right pleural effusion, possibly
representing hemothorax given history, although moderate
effusion has been present since [**2182-11-22**] CT. Pulmonary
edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with an ischemic left foot and was
brought to the cath lab for intervention.  She underwent
angioplasty and received tPA and stenting with transient
improvement in flow.  However, her foot again became pulseless
and ischemic, and she became hypotensive requiring pressers.
Her family (daughter and son) wanted the patient made
comfortable, and expressed that the patient would not wish to
live without her foot.  Subsequently the patient's goal of care
was changed to comfort and she was started on a Morphine drip.
She died shortly after this.
