Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zosyn / ceftriaxone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, altered mental status, apnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2118-10-20**] central venous catheter placed
[**2118-10-20**] arterial line placed
[**2118-10-21**] left percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old female w/MS (bedbound), DM, COPD [**Hospital 4045**]
transferred from rehab facility w/acute onset AMS.  Reportedly
hypoxic to high 80s.  The history is obtained from her son who
is at bedside.
.
Of note, she has frequent UTIs and was hospitalized in [**Month (only) 116**] for
urosepsis (E.coli sensitive to Zosyn, Meropenem, Gent).
.
In the ED, she very rapidly deteriorated, began vomiting and her
BPs rose to 200s systolic initially in the ED.  She underwent a
CT head - no bleed.  She became not responsive to voice or
sternal rub, then became apneic.  There was ?seizure, no known
seizure disorder --> given 2mg ativan.  Due to ongoing hypoxia,
she was given ketamine to take a look at the cords -->
laryngospasm --> intubation.   Intubated with ketamine,
lidocaine and fentanyl for airway protection; fent and midaz for
sedation.  During the intubation, she actively vomited and
aspirated gastric contents.  She was given gentamicin and
admitted to the MICU.

Son reports that this all happened over a matter of 1 hour this
afternoon.  She has needed to be intubated in the past for
urosepsis.  Additionally, she had minimal UOP and was given 3L
NS.  However, she was never hypotensive, 102/78 at lowest
(usually 110s-120s).  Febrile to 103 rectally.  ABG: pH 7.25
pCO2 55 pO2 87 HCO3 25 BaseXS -3 (done after intubation, before
adjustment of vent setting).
.
On transfer: 103 rectal, 102/68, 94, 97% on AC 400/18/5/100%.
.

IMAGING:
[**10-19**] CT HEAD: FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, evidence of acute major
vascular territorial infarction, edema, or shift of normally
midline structures is present.  Extensive confluent
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are
consistent with small vessel ischemic changes. The ventricles
and sulci are enlarged consistent with cortical atrophy, likely
secondary to patient's known multiple sclerosis. Basal cisterns
are patent. Air-fluid levels in the maxillary and sphenoid
sinuses are consistent with sinusitis. Mastoid air cells are
well pneumatized.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process
.
[**10-20**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: CHEST: There is a consolidation in
the right lower lobe, consistent with patient's history of
aspiration pneumonia. There are bilateral trace effusions. There
is a possible tiny right pneumothorax, which is incompletely
imaged. There are no pulmonary nodules or masses. The base of
the heart is normal in size. There is calcifications of the
coronary arteries. There is no pericardial effusion.
ABDOMEN: The liver is normal shape and contour. There are no
discrete
hepatic masses. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct
dilation.  The portal veins are patent. There is no gallbladder.
The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. The bilateral adrenal
glands are normal.
In the right kidney, there is a large renal staghorn calculus
without
hydronephrosis or hydroureter. In the left kidney, there is a 16
mm calculus within the left proximal ureter. There is associated
mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis, likely secondary to ureteral
obstruction. Three smaller non-obstructing left renal calculi
are present. They measure 10 mm, 6 mm and 5 mm. The kidneys
enhance heterogeneously. On the right, it appears to be more due
to artifact. On the left, the heterogeneous enhancement appears
somewhat more geographical, is concerning for pyelonephritis.
There is no excretion of the contrast into either ureter on the
right or the left. The right ureter, although nor opacified, is
normal in course and caliber. The left ureter has peripheral rim
enhancement, suggesting underlying infection.  There is a Foley
in place in a collapsed bladder. There are no stones seen within
the bladder.
The stomach is unremarkable. The duodenum and jejunum are normal
in course
and caliber. There is no mesenteric stranding. There is a large
amount of
fecal material within the rectum. The sigmoid and
