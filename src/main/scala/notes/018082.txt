Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76M with hx of CAD s/p CABG x 2 ([**2140**],[**2148**]), multiple NSTEMI,
and PTCA ([**2154**],[**2156**]), HTN, DM2, MM on dex/Revlimid/Velcade
presents with chest pain. It started at 5pm and went away with
SL nitro at home. Returned at 6pm, took another nitro which did
not help. Chest pain similar in quality to pain with prior MIs.
Called 911. EMS gave ASA 325mg, morphine 4mg, and another SL
nitro.
.
Of note, patient was recently d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**9-30**] after
NSTEMI with trop to 0.25 complicated by cardiac catherization in
which rotoblade became lodged in the left circumflex. CT surgery
felt emergent bypass was not possible. ECG at this time showed
STDs in V1-V5, II, III, and aVF. He was admitted to the CCU,
started on nitro gtt and lasix. He was medically managed with
ASA, carvedilol, statin. Not anticoagulated given his
thrombocytopenia and hx of HIT. The blade was thought to be the
cause of a subsequent left lateral wall infarction, leading to
inferior wall hypokinesis, mod/severe MR due to papillary muscle
infarct, and a drop in EF from 60 to 40%. Patient was
subsequently re-admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from [**Date range (1) 112543**] for recurrent
chest pain and rising troponins (peaked at 2.27) thought to be
related to continuing infarction.
.
Currently on Revlimid/Velcade/dex for MM (cycle 2, day 1
[**2163-10-13**]). Episode of chest pain leading to first [**Hospital1 2025**] admission
was also preceded by chemotherapy that day.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 7, 96.0, 74, 132/89, 18, 99% 4L.
ECG showed ST depressions in V3-V6. Labs and imaging significant
for lactate 4.1, trop 0.65, glu 381 with gap 13, UA with trace
ketones and large glucose, calcium 10.9, WBC 2.5, Hct 30.8, Plt
92, and INR 1.4. CXR showed small bilateral effusions and some
vascular fullness. In the ER, the patient still c/o of CP after
additional SL nitro.  Chest pain improved with morphine, but did
not resolve. Chest pain finally resolved with nitro gtt.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, patient was free of chest pain.
Vitals were 98.1, 80, 127/82, 12, and 97% on 2L.

STUDIES:
([**10-13**]) CXR:IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with bilateral
small pleural effusions, left greater than right, and adjacent
atelectasis.
.
([**10-15**]) CXR: There is substantial interval improvement up to
almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema.  Heart size and
mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including tortuous
aorta.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.
.
([**10-14**]) ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior
and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA
distribution). Moderate mitral regurgitation most likely due to
papillary muscle dysfunction. Dilated ascending aorta. Pulmonary
artery hypertension.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has moderate mitral regurgitation. Based on [**2157**]
ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, a follow-up
echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year. The patient has a mildly
dilated ascending aorta. Based on [**2161**] ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic
Guidelines, if not previously known or a change, a follow-up
echocardiogram is suggested in 1 year; if previously known and
stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in [**2-25**] years.
Based on [**2158**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
