History of Present Illness:
48-year-old male fell down approximately 13 stairs while
intoxicated.  He was then transported to [**Hospital **] Hospital. GCS
there 13-14 but pt became combative and was subsequently
intubated for airway protection.  CT scan demonstrated large
right SDH/SAH with right to left midline shift, also with left
pneumothorax and multiple rib fxs.  A left chest tube was
inserted and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Past Medical History:
1. Alcohol abuse
2. Tobacco abuse

Physical Exam:
GCS: E4 V1T M6; in no apparent distress.  Attempts to mouth a
word occasionally.
Pupils 3mm equal and reactive.  Craniectomy wound healing well
without sign of infection. Tracheostomy site clean.
Breath sounds course.  Equal expansion
RRR without M/R/G though distant
Abd mildly full but soft and nontender
Moves all 4 extremities.  Able to lift all 4 and follows
commands. quadraparetic though Right>Left.

abscess pocket.


Pertinent Results:
Head CT: Stable intraventricular, intraparenchymal,
subarachnoid, and extra-axial hemorrhage. Stable mass effect on
the right ventricle.

Chest x-ray: The heart is normal in size. The nasogastric tube
is coiled in the upper stomach. The patient has been intubated
and the ETT terminates approximately 5 cm above the carina. The
lungs appear clear and fully expanded. A chest tube is present
terminating in the left upper hemithorax, and there is no
obvious pneumothorax. There is a fracture of the left lateral
aspect of the left sixth rib. Mediastinal contours are normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
48 y/o male s/p fall down 13 steps while intoxicated.  Injuries
notable for a right subdural hematoma and left sided
pneumothorax.  The patient was transfered from an OSH, after
chest tube placement, for further management of his injuries.
Once here, the patient was evaluated by the trauma and
neurosurgery teams.  Given the subdural and midline shift noted
on his head CT he was taken to the OR for emergent evacuation of
the blood.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
subsequently transfered to the ICU.  The patient remained in the
ICU for 28 days.  His course there was complicated by difficulty
to wean secondary to pulmonary edema and PNA.  He was trached
and a g-tube placed on HD 14.  On HD 29, the patient was
discharged to the floor.  There, he was continued on cipro and
flagyl for E. coli/psuedomonal PNA and diverticulitis noted on
abd CT.  His white count continued to trend downwards and was
afebrile at discharge. The patient will be discharged to a vent
rehab facility.  He will have continued wound care for his
gluteal fold breakdown.  He will need to follow up with
neurosurgery and trauma surgery.
