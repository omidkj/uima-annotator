MRCP: IMPRESSION:
1. Dilated common hepatic duct with smooth tapering to the
pancreatic head. No choledocholithiasis present. Please note
that the study is somewhat suboptimal due to non-breath hold
technique. The above descrived findings may be secondary to
sphincter dysfunction or ampullary stenosis. There is no mass in
the region of the distal CBD or pancreatic head.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
3. Left adrenal nodule which is not well characterized on the
current exam. Given the spiculated right lung mass, an
evaluation with a dynamic CT is recommended to exclude
metastatic disease involving the adrenal gland.

[**2104-1-11**]
ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include septal akinesis/hypokinesis, apical akinesis, mid to
distal anterior and anterolateral hypokinesis and inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis. No definte left ventricular
thrombus identified but cannot exclude. The right ventricle is
dilated Right ventricular systolic function is probably
preserved(however intrinsic function may be depressed given
severity of tricuspid regurgitation). The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2104-1-11**], Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] was admitted to the surgical ICU under
the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. With her epigastric tenderness, a
troponin of 0.41, and shortness of breath, her exact diagnosis
was unclear. Cardiology was consulted and felt that she
experienced a troponin leak [**3-14**] demand ischemia. She was not
having an acute coronary syndrome. A GI consult was obtained for
a possible ERCP after an MRCP revealed cholelithiasis without
evidence of cholecystitis. It was determined that with her
overall condition (MDS, CAD) and improving exam, an ERCP was not
indicated at this time. Since there was no evidence of
cholecystitis or cholangitis, there was no indication for any
surgical intervention either. On HD 3, Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] was
transferred out of the ICU and care was transferred to the
medical service. On the floor Ms. [**Known lastname 23333**] began the receipt of
a 7 day regimen of Levo and Flagyl for possible cholecystitis as
per surgery rec. Otherwise, the pt was pain free and stable. A
discussion about palliative care was held with the family who
decided that rehab with a bridge to hospice would be their ideal
plan (pt. still to have hct's followed and be transfused PRN).
The pt was placed back on her most of her home medications
except select blood pressure medications because of SBP in the
low 100's. The pt received 1U PRBC's the day of discharge for a
slowly decreasing hematocrit secondary to her myelodysplastic
disease. Pt was then discharged to rehab.
