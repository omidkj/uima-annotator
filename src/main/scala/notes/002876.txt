Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4358**]
Chief Complaint:
cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
71M with h/o ESRD on HD (M/W/F), chronic systolic HF (EF 15-20%)
s/p MI presenting with nonproductive cough x3d. His longstanding
DOE is not acutely changed with the onset of cough, but he is
able to ambulate significantly less than baseline due to
fatigue. He reports leg weakness and back pain limiting his
ability to get out of a chair. He can only walk a few feet
before feeling SOB, lightheadedness and needing to rest. He
denies chest pain on exertion. He has had orthopnea for several
months which is unchanged. He reports leg swelling that has been
stable for 2 months since starting HD in [**12/2182**] and fluctuates
with dialysis. Per OMR, he has been coming to dialysis above his
expected dry weights and has had 3-4L removed at dialysis
sessions recently.
.
Of note, pt was just admitted [**2-28**] to [**3-2**] for diarrhea and
abdominal pain. CT abdomen pelvis showed no colitis or acute
process. Nothing to suggest infection or systemic illness. Stool
Cx's negative and pt was treated and discharged on Imodium. He
c/o cough on that admission but CXR reportedly negative.
.
Initial ED vitals: 98.4 83 139/80 18 95% RA. On ED exam, had
extremely faint bibasilar crackles, faint wheezing, difficulty
taking a maximal inspiration due to cough, protuberant abdomen
but soft NT.
EKG showed sinus at 74 bpm, 1st degree AV block, no change from
prior. Bedside u/s showed minimal effusion visible, no evidence
of tamponade. Pt received albuterol and ipratropium nebs and
benzonatate. CXR showed fluid overload, so pt is admitted for HD
to remove fluid.
.
On the floor, pt has been started on HD - 3L removed with plan
for repeat HD tomorrow. He continues to have dry cough, but is
otherwise comfortable in bed and stable. Reports having eaten
take-out Chinese food several times since leaving the hospital a
few days before. Denies any more episodes of diarrhea or blood
in his stool.

Past Medical History:
- Chronic Systolic Heart Failure (EF 15% [**11/2182**] at [**Hospital1 112**])

IMAGING
.
[**3-7**] CXR
FINDINGS: AP and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.
The heart
is massively enlarged, as before. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are not
significantly changed. Diffuse interstitial opacities with
perihilar
predominance are likely secondary to mild interstitial pulmonary
edema,
increased compared to radiographs from [**2183-3-1**]. No
focal
consolidations concerning for pneumonia. There is no
pneumothorax. The
mediastinal contours are stable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
2. Massive cardiomegaly, not significantly changed.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed.
.
[**3-8**] CXR
MPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-7**]:
Mild pulmonary edema has improved, severe cardiomegaly has not.
Mediastinal
veins are not particularly dilated. There is no large pleural
effusion.
Dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax.
.
[**3-10**] TTE
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global
hypokinesis and relative preservation of basal inferior and
inferolateral function (LVEF = 25 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index
is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary art
