on [**2195-9-24**] for ERCP.  Post procedure patient's O2 saturation
decreased and patient was hypotensive with metabolic acidosis.
He was intubated on [**2195-9-25**] secondary to respiratory fatigue.  The
patient started on Flagyl and Gentamycin on [**2195-9-24**] secondary to
increased temperatures.  Vancomycin started on [**2195-9-25**], tube feeds
started on [**2195-9-26**].  The patient had episode of NSVT on [**2195-9-28**]
which resolved spontaneously.  Surgery was consulted secondary to
increased temperature despite being on cholecystostomy since

confirmed by ultrasound.  The patient defervesced after drain was
placed on [**2195-10-1**].  The patient had repeat run of NSVT on [**2195-10-1**]
and was restarted on his beta blocker.  On [**2195-10-2**] the patient
had new T wave inversions in anterior and lateral leads, however,
enzymes were negative.  Echocardiogram showed decreased left
ventricular systolic function, inferolateral and anterior and
septal hypokinesis and 4+ MR.  The patient was extubated on
[**2195-10-2**] and was started on po diet.  Vancomycin was stopped.
The patient had been requiring diuresis since extubation.

expiratory rhonchi.  Abdomen, gallbladder drain in place,
minimal tenderness around drain site, otherwise soft,
nontender, non distended with positive bowel sounds.

bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Gallbladder fluid growing rare enterococcus

The patient had episode of acute renal failure with rising
creatinine.  All nephrotoxic drugs were stopped.  Renal
ultrasound was normal.  The patient began responding to fluid
boluses.
GI, patient had persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase and
total bilirubin throughout hospital course.  After being
transferred to the floor the patient developed new abdominal
tenderness around bile drain site.  CT of the abdomen was
negative for bile leak, but subsequent imaging revealed evidence
of a leak.  After discussion with the patient, his wife, and his
sons, he was taken to ERCP for possible stent placement. ERCP
showed bile duct which was not dilated but contained irregular
strictures, with small stones at the junction of the cystic duct.
Multiple stones were present in the gallbladder.  A plastic
stent was successfully placed.  In the recovery room following
