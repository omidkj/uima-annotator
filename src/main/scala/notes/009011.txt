History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 55 yo male with PMHx significant ADHD who is being
transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for emergent ERCP. Pt
presented to [**Location (un) **] on [**2175-7-17**] after having one day of lower
abdominal pain epigastric pain, mild LUQ pain, nausea, emesis,
increased frequency and dysuria. CT scan showed mild sigmoid
diverticulitis without perforation or abscess.  LFTs were
elevated, and he was given IVF.  Treated conservatively with
unasyn and gentamycin.  He also had an echo done which showed an
EF of 50-55% but an old septal MI. He left AMA.
.
Patient returned the 13th with worsening pain, nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea.  No hematemesis, hematochezia, melena. Tmax was
105.6 and labs notable for WBC 7.6 (down from 17.6 3 days
prior), plt 78, AST 108, ALT 91, alk phos 80, bilirubin 8.8. He
was started on zosyn, gentamycin, and cipro initially but the
latter was stopped.  He was found to be hypotensive and required
levophed and neosynephrine.  He then developed nonanion gap
metabolic acidosis and was intubated for "airway protection".
He was started on a fentanyl and xigris gtt d/t APACHE score of
27 (the latter d/c'd early). Repeat CT with mild diverticulitis
and gallbladder U/S without GB distension/biliary dilation.
Normal HIDA scan with minimal filling of gallbladder after 4mg
morphine, but no filling in duodenum.  Patient transferred for
emergent ERCP d/t suspicion for obstructive process and
?ascending cholangitis.  He was also noted to be in DIC.  All
blood cultures from [**7-17**], [**7-19**], [**7-20**] NGTD, UA negative, CXR
without infectious process.

EKG: [**7-20**] - sinus tachy at 103, septal infarct, LAD
.
Radiology:
[**7-20**] Abd CT - Left renal stone without obstruction or
hydronephrosis.  Probably right renal cyst.  Sigmoid colon with
marked mucosal thickening and diverticular changes.  No evidence
of perforation or abscess.
.
[**7-21**] Abd CT - Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.  Minimal free fluid in abdomen.  Mild degree of
diverticulitis assoicate with the sigmoid colon.  Not progressed
since prior.  No free fluid or air.  No abscess.
.
[**2175-7-22**] RUQ U/S:
Small amount of ascites, no gallbladder distension or biliary
dilatation.  Increase echogenicity of liver, nonspecific.
.
[**2175-7-22**] CXR:
RIJ in SVC. Endotracheal tube above thoracic inlet.  No pneumo.
Pathy opacification is seen scattered throughout both lungs,
more so in medial portion of right lung base.
.
[**7-21**] CT Head - No hemorrhage. Nml.
.
[**7-21**] CXR - Prominence of pulmonary vessels.
.
[**7-27**] CT Head w/o contast: No evidence of hemorrhage, mass
effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
.
[**7-27**] RUQ U/S: FINDINGS: Portal veins are patent and have normal
direction of flow. The liver is echogenic consistent with fatty
infiltration of the liver. However, other forms of more severe
liver disease including cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded on
the basis of this study.
.
[**7-27**] IMPRESSION:

1. Portal venous air and air within the SMV branches.

2. Bowel wall thickening of right and transverse colon with some
pericolic fat stranding in region of cecum. Differential
diagnosis includes ischemia and inflammatory/infectious colitis.

3. Sigmoid diverticulosis.

Per report, on [**7-21**], the patient had acute diverticulitis.
The images are not available for comparison currently but the
sigmoid appears normal.

4 Nonobstructing 8-mm left renal stone.

5. Splenomegaly.

6. Patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities consistent with
pulmonary edema, but infection should be considered in the
proper clinical setting.
CT w and w/o contrast of Chest/abd/pelv
.
[**8-2**] CXR - Even though endotracheal tube has been removed, left
lower lobe atelectasis has improved. Overall lung volumes are
still small, unchanged. Mild interstitial pulmonary edema
persists in the left lower lung, clear elsewhere. Heart size top
normal. No pneumothorax. Pleural effusion, if any, is small, in
the right chest. Bilateral central venous catheters end in the
lower third of the SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
[**8-3**] RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION: Interval development of left occlusive
portal vein thrombosis compared to prior ultrasound on MRI.
.
[**8-4**] CT abd/pelv w/ contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Persitent IMV gas and thrombus traced to the sigmoid colon,
which is thickened as before. Less thickening in the ascending
colon and unchanged in the transverse colon with ascites. This
all lis likely from an infectious colitis with breakdown of the
sigmoid wall causing a septic IMV and portal vein
thrombophlebitis.

2. New nonocclusive portal vein thrombus at the confluence of
the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein with persistent
left portal vein thrombus.

3. Unchanged left kidney stone.

4. Subtle approximately 1-cm hyperdensity within the anterior
right lobe of the liver that cannot be adequately characterized
on this study. Followup MR would provide the best
characterization for this lesion if the patient can breath-hold.

5. Right upper pole cystic lesion within the kidney likely
representing simple renal cyst. Attention can be focused on this
lesion on subsequent evaluation of the liver lesion.
