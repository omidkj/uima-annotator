ADDENDUM:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to improve from a
cardiovascular and respiratory standpoint.  His dopamine was
initially discontinued with a Lasix drip and dobutamine drip
continued.  He diuresed well at 800 cc to 1000 cc per day.
The Lasix drip was switched to a bolus regimen of 100 mg
intravenously q.8h. and eventually to 80 mg intravenously
q.8h. with a consistent diuresis of 200 cc to 500 cc per day.
The dobutamine drip was discontinued on [**11-29**] with
systolic pressures in the low 100 range.  His renal function
continued to do well.  He underwent extension of his
gastrostomy tube to a post pyloric jejunostomy tube without
incident.  On [**11-29**], his trachea was extended in a
percutaneous fashion to a bypass granuloma tissue on the
anterior aspect of the trachea diagnosis on bronchoscopy on
[**11-29**].  He now is able to ventilate considerably better.
His ventilator was ultimately weaned to a pressure support of
between 10 and 12 with a PEEP of 10, and an FIO2 of 0.4,
pulling in volumes of 300 cc to 400 cc per breath.  His
mental status continued to clear to his baseline; however, he
appeared more depressed than usual, and per Psychiatric
consultation was started on Celexa at 10 mg p.o. q.d. to be
advanced 20 mg p.o. q.d.   His renal function continued to
remain stable with a creatinine of 0.9 to 1.  His edema
resolved impressively with minimal pitting edema below the
knee, 1+ above the knee, and 2+ in the presacral region.  He
was maintained on Lovenox for anticoagulation with regard to
his valves.
