HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 33 year old Brazilian
man who was painting his house at 05:00 p.m. on [**8-26**].
At around 09:00 p.m. he developed right facial droop,
slurred speech and altered mental status.  He was taken to an
outside hospital by EMS where a CT scan showed a 2 centimeter
by 4 centimeter by 3 centimeter bleed in the right basal
ganglion. He was then transferred to the Neurosurgery Service
at [**Hospital1 69**].  He was started on
Nipride and Decadron.  Medicine was consulted regarding the
question of malignant hypertension.  They declined the
secondary hypertension work-up because they felt that normal
renal function along with long-standing hypertension was less
likely.  The patient did have a diagnosis of essential
hypertension but was not taking his medications, possibly
Hydrochlorothiazide, for one to two years.

An angiogram was done which was negative for malformation.
It was thought that the patient had this bleed due to his
history of essential hypertension.

The patient also had a fever and increased white blood cell
count that was noticed after he was intubated.  His sputum
was positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus and
he was started on Levaquin.  He was extubated on [**8-31**]
and did well.

He was weaned off Nitroprusside and that was stopped on
[**9-1**], and he was then started on Lopressor 100 mg
p.o. q. six, Enalapril 20 mg q. day and Clonidine patch for
blood pressure control.  He was transferred to the Neurology
Service at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On mental status, he was alert,
oriented to person and place, not date or year.  There was
some language barrier due to his speaking mainly Portugese.
His speech was dysarthric.  He can repeat but difficult to
assess secondary to language.  No apraxia.  He is able to
follow commands appropriately.  Difficult to understand at
times.  Cranial nerves were right facial droop, extraocular
movements intact.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  There was right sided tongue deviation.  Sensation
was normal.  Shrug was normal.  Strength was five out of five
on the left; on the right deltoids are three plus; biceps
were four minus, triceps were three plus, wrist flexors were
three plus, wrist extensors four minus.  Finger flexors were
three plus, finger extensors four minus.  Interosseous four
minus, hip flexors four plus.  Hip extensors five.  Knee
flexors five minus, knee extensors five.  Toe extensors five,
toe flexors five.  Sensory was intact to light touch for both
temperature and proprioception.  Deep tendon reflex were two
out of four plus bilateral upper extremities and lower
extremities.  Right patella was three out of four plus, and
left was two out of four. Gait was not assessed.  The patient
refused to walk.  Coordination was normal,
finger-to-nose-finger, rapid alternating movements on the
left as well.  There was slight ataxia on the right likely
secondary to weakness.  There was slow repetitive knee
movements.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On admission to the Neurology Service, the
patient was doing well and continued to do well with Physical
Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Speech.  It was deemed that
the patient should continue these three modalities of
rehabilitation on discharge.

In regards to his blood pressure he was on the medicines as
stated above.  On the day prior to discharge, his pressures
were extremely well controlled.  His pressures ranged from
100 to 130 systolic over 68 to 80 diastolic.  Multiple doses
of his Lopressor were held in the two days prior to discharge
for a total of four doses held over two days, secondary to
the low blood pressure parameters.  His other vital signs
were stable and the patient and his wife were excited to go
home.

He was sent home on [**9-4**], and was doing well
neurologically.  We decreased his Metoprolol to 100 mg twice
a day as his blood pressure was well controlled and continued
the rest of his medicines as stated below.
