History of Present Illness:
History Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname 91103**] is a 73F with a history
of aortic thrombi s/p aortobifemoral stent placement, CHF (last
EF <45%), PVD, HOLD, HTN, CKD, COPD, afib on coumadin, who comes
in with bilateral pulseless lower extremities since 1pm on day
of
admission.  She has decreased sensation and motor function R>L
which has worsened from her baseline of decreased RLE motor
function.  She also has increased pain and mottling of the BLE
R>L which is new.  She has multiple open wounds on her legs and
feet including a large R heel ulcer which reportedly developed
while being in a walking boot or immobilizer.  She has multiple
skin tears which occur with minimal mechanical trauma.  She
reports that she was minimally ambulatory with assist but has
been unable to ambulate for the past 1-2 days.  She has a
history
of an aortobifemoral stent which was placed endovascularly in
[**2156-5-23**] for aortic thrombus as well as bilateral femoral
artery cutdowns with thrombectomy for clot at the same time.
She
denies any other vascular procedures but neither she nor the
husband are positive and the records from the outside facility
are incomplete.  She is transferred emergently from [**Hospital 189**]
Hospital for evaluation of the pulseless legs.

VASCULAR ROS:

Pertinent Results:
CTA AORTA/BIFEM/ILIAC RUNOFF W/W&WO C AND RECONS Study Date of
[**2156-6-29**]

CT CHEST:  The thyroid gland appears heterogeneous, possibly
containing
subcentimeter hypodense lesions inferiorly (2, 12), which could
be assessed by ultrasound if not already performed.  There is
moderate-to-severe diffuse atherosclerotic calcification.  The
heart demonstrates severe biatrial enlargement and multivessel
coronary arterial calcifications as well as mitral annular and
aortic valve calcifications.  A moderate-sized pericardial
effusion is present inferior to the heart.  A small epicardial
lymph node is calcified.  There is pretracheal and precarinal
lymphadenopathy measuring up to 14 mm.  There is no axillary
lymphadenopathy.  There are bilateral pleural effusions,
moderate on the right and small on the left, with associated
compressive atelectasis.  Mild bronchiectasis is seen in the
right lung base.  Patchy peribronchovascular opacities in the
right lower lobe, in combination
with layering fluid in the upper esophagus, suggest aspiration.

CT ABDOMEN:  Note is made of reflux of contrast into the hepatic
veins,
compatible with right heart insufficiency.  The liver
demonstrates no focal lesion.  The spleen and pancreas appear
within normal limits.  The adrenal glands appear thickened,
without definite nodularity.  The left kidney demonstrates
delayed nephrogram and scattered areas of wedge-shaped
transcortical hypoattenuation, consistent with renal infarction.
 The right kidney demonstrates relatively preserved nephrogram,
however, contains a somewhat wedge-shaped hypodensity in the
lower pole (3A, 140), possibly an additional area of infarct.
Small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber. There is no
free air or free fluid.  Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes
are noted.

CT PELVIS:  Assessment is highly limited due to streak artifact
from bilateral hip arthroplasty.  Allowing for such, the bladder
and rectum appear within normal limits.

CTA:  There is moderate amount of thrombosis within the proximal
left
subclavian artery near the origin (3A, 1).  Remainder of arch
vessels are
unremarkable.  The aorta is normal in caliber without dissection
or aneurysm.  There is diffuse severe atherosclerotic disease.
Although not tailored for assessment of pulmonary embolism,
there are no large filling defects to suggest central pulmonary
embolism.  The celiac trunk is patent.  The hepatic arterial
anatomy is conventional.  There is high-grade narrowing of SMA
origin with patent distal vessel.  The left renal arterial
origin appears narrowed; however, distally, the left renal
artery is opacified.  The right renal artery appears patent.  No
inferior mesenteric artery is visualized.

Patient is status post aortobiliac stent grafting.  Distal to
the renal
arterial origins, there is complete thrombosis of the aorta,
with thrombus
extending to the level of distal common iliac arteries.
Bilateral total knee arthroplasty generates considerable metal
streak artifacts, limiting below assessment.  Multiple soft
tissue ulcers are seen along bilateral lower extremities.

RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:  On the right, there is reconstitution of
flow in the distal right common iliac artery and external and
internal iliac arteries via the inferior epigastric and
circumflex iliac arteries.  There is minimal trickle flow in the
common femoral artery and proximal superficial femoral artery,
which attenuates within the mid superficial femoral artery.
From the mid superficial femoral artery distally, there is
complete non-opacification of distal arterial branches including
trifurcation of anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal
arteries, which is likely related to slow flow, though high
grade  obstruction proximally is not excluded.

LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: On the left, there is similarly
reconstitution of the distal common iliac artery and
opacification of the internal and external iliac arteries by
retrograde filling via inferior epigastric and circumflex iliac
arteries.  Trickle flow is seen in the common femoral and
proximal superficial femoral arteries.  From the level of mid
superficial femoral artery distally, there is complete
non-opacification of arterial branches, including trifurcation
into the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal arteries to
the level of the ankle. This is likely related to slow flow, and
less likely due to proximal occlusion.  Clips are seen in the
left groin.  No underlying vascular stent or graft is noted.

BONE WINDOW:  There is diffuse osseous demineralization.  There
is high-grade L1 wedge compression deformity with greater than
60% loss of height.  Severe discogenic osteoarthritis is present
at L4-L5 with endplate sclerosis and vacuum phenomenon.  A large
expansile lytic lesion within the left ischial tuberosity is
incompletely assessed and could be correlated with prior exam
and clinical history.  Patient is status post bilateral total
hip arthroplasty and bilateral total knee arthroplasty with
hardware grossly in expected locations.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Complete occlusion of the infrarenal aorta with
non-opacification of
proximal common iliac arteries.  Bilateral distal common iliac
arterial
reconstitution via circumflex iliac and inferior epigastric
arteries,
opacifying proximal superficial femoral arterie
