Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2134-10-26**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal with inferolateral and anterolateral hypokinesis. The
distal anteroseptal segments may also be hypokinetic but views
are suboptimal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= ?45%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-28**],
regional wall motion abnormalities are similar. Overall left
ventricular systolic function appears slightly more vigorous in
the current study but views are suboptimal for comparison.

CARDIAC MRI [**2134-10-27**]:
1. Moderately enlarged left ventricular cavity size with
akinesis of the basal to apical inferoseptum, inferior and
inferolateral walls. The LVEF was moderately depressed at 35%.
The effective forward LVEF was moderately
depressed at 33%. CMR evidence of prior myocardial
scarring/infarction in the basal to apical inferoseptum,
inferior and inferolateral walls. Late
gadolinium contrast-enhanced CMR images demonstrating areas of
hyperenhancement as described above. The findings are consistent
with low
likelihood of functional recovery of these walls after
mechanical
revascularization. There is hyperenhancement seen in the mid to
distal
anterior septum which is likely an artifact rather than scar.
2. Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function.
The RVEF was mildly depressed at 43%.
3. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonic regurgitation.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was normal.
5. Moderate left atrial enlargement. Mild right atrial
enlargement.
6. A note is made of a hemangioma in the vertebral body at T7.

PA-Lat [**2134-10-30**]
Compared with [**2134-10-28**], the ET tube has been removed. A new
left-sided
pacemaker is present, lead tips overlie the right atrium and
right ventricle.
Again seen is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires. Elevated
right
hemidiaphragm and atelectasis and/or scarring in the right
cardiophrenic
region as well as thickening of the minor fissure. No CHF, other
parenchymal
opacities, or effusion. Possible faint residual
pneumopericardium noted.

IMPRESSION: New left-sided pacemaker with lead tips over right
atrium and
right ventricle. Atelectasis and/or scarring in the right
cardiophrenic
region.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yoM recently s/p triple-CABG [**2134-9-23**] at [**Hospital1 18**] (LIMA to the
LAD, SVG to the OM, and SVG to the RCA) whose post-operative
course was complicated by AF-RVR and sustained VT. The patient
was admitted [**10-26**] after an EP study for VT showed inducible VT
from RV which was stable and monomorphic from basal inferior
wall. He required DC cardioversion and Amiodarone loading. After
the procedure he had an EF of 45% and was admitted for EP scar
ablation.
.
# Sustained VT: On [**10-27**], Cardiac MRI was performed which showed
EF 35 % and prior myocardial scarring/infarction in the basal to
apical inferoseptum, inferior and inferolateral walls. VT
ablation on [**10-28**] was unsuccessful and he required
intra-procedure DC cardioversion for sustained VT. He was
cardioverted to NSR. He had peri-procedure hemodynamic
instability for which he was admitted to the ICU on
intra-procedure pressors with post-procedure SBPs into the 200s.
He was extubated on first day in the ICU, pressors were weaned
and his labile hypertension resolved. An ICD was placed on [**10-29**]
without event. Patient was restarted on his home dose of
Metoprolol as detailed below. Amiodarone and Warfarin were
stopped prior to discharge.
.
# CAD: No signs or symptoms of ischemia this admission;
continued medical management of CAD with aspirin and
simvastatin, and was discharged on these medications as detailed
below.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after having a procedure to
ablate a scar in your heart that had been causing abnormal heart
rhythms. This procedure was not successful, as you went into an
abnormal rhythm during it and had to be shocked into a normal
rhythm. Because of this, an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) was placed, which will shock
you out of abnormal rhythms in the future.
.
Please make the following changes to your medications:
STOP taking COUMADIN
STOP taking AMIODARONE

Take your other medications as previously prescribed to you by
your physicians.
