History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4643**] is a 79 yo male with hx of CAD, CHF, Afib, AS s/p
[**Known lastname 1291**], DM2 who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with staph bacteremia
[**11-4**] and [**11-5**] in need of a TEE. Patient was discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2104-10-23**]. He was admitted at that time for increasing
dependence on the vent and was thought to have a VAP and
questionable CHF exacerbation. He was diuresed daily and treated
with levaquin for stenotrophomonas pna. Patient was also able to
be weaned from the vent and was discharged on trach mask with
50% FIO2. Patient then went to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and during his
course there developed a klebsiella UTI and pna and is being
treated with cefaclor per sensitivities. Start date of cefaclor
appears to be [**11-1**]. On [**11-3**], patient spiked a fever to 101
rectally and blood cultures were drawn. He has been afebrile
since then. He also had a rising white count from 8-->13 noted
on [**11-4**] with diarrhea and was started on po vanco empirically.
Blood cultures from [**11-4**] and [**11-5**] are growing out staph aureus
and patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for TEE since he has recent
history of [**Hospital1 1291**]. Also has stage 4 pressure ulcer on right foot
which could also be causing the fever and bacteremia as there is
a question of osteomyelitis.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2104-11-6**] 6:16 PM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-19**] through 18:
Extensive infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has improved since
[**10-23**] and previous moderate bilateral pleural effusions
have decreased, consistent with improving pulmonary edema.
Residual abnormality could represent pneumonia to some degree.
Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette due to
cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion is unchanged.
Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. No pneumothorax or
mediastinal widening.
.
FOOT 2 VIEWS PORT RIGHT  [**2104-11-7**] 10:16 AM
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
TEE [**2104-11-7**]:
A small secundum atrial septal defect/stretched PFO is seen with
color Doppler (cine loop #60). The left atrium is dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). The right atrium is dilated. There is
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular
systolic function appears preserved. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta, arch and descending aorta. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis (but may be
slightly UNDERestimated on this study). No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. A paravalvular jet of moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The jet emanates from the
posterolateral aspect of the aortic annulus, adjacent to the
left sinus of Valsalva. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Moderate paravalvular
prosthetic aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 yo with CAD, CHF, DM2 who presents with bacteremia
growing staph.
.
#. Staph bacteremia- Patient had positive blood cultures with
coag + Staph at rehab and GPC in one BCx bottle at [**Hospital1 18**]. TEE
was negative for endocarditis. GS from foot decub showed coag
negative staph and diptheriae (likely contaminate). He continued
to have high white count despite treatment, though he was never
febrile during his stay. Surveillance blood cultures taken after
[**2104-11-6**] showed no growth several days after drawn.  He was
continued on vancomycin IV throughout his stay.  Sensitivities
of the original positive blood culture showed MRSA that was
sensitive to Bactrim.  Per vascular, the decision was made to
treat the infection as if he has osteomyelitis.  The plan is to
continue IV vancomycin for a total of 6 weeks to end, last day
[**2104-12-10**].
.
#. Klebsiella UTI- diagnosed at rehab and treated with cefaclor
for 7 days before admission. He was continued on ceftriaxone
(cefaclor is not formulary at [**Hospital1 18**], though sensitivies from
rehab showed that it was sensitive to ceftriaxone).  Urine
culture from [**11-6**] negative.  The plan is to continue the
ceftriaxone for a total of 14 days of cefaclor/ceftriaxone, last
day [**11-19**].
.
#. Afib: Patient has chronic afib and had periods of RVR on [**11-8**]
which were controlled with his usual scheduled dose of
metoprolol. Patient is anticoagulated with coumadin. Will check
coags on admission. His INR was therapeutic during his stay and
his rate was controlled with his home metoprolol dose. He was
monitored on telemetry.
.
#. Ulcer right foot- Patient has a stage 2 and stage 4 pressure
ulcer on right foot, one on his heel and the other on the sole
of his foot. P
