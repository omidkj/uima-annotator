Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Initial history and physical is as per Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (un) 101568**]
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 year-old female with a history of morbid
obesity s/p gastric bypass, pulmonary hypertension, and asthma
who presents with acute on chronic abdominal pain, for which she
was discharged on [**2124-2-18**] after a negative evaluation which
included abdominal/pelvic CT.  She reported improvement in her
abdominal pain, which she describes as sharp, epigastric pain
radiating to the RUQ and LUQ, after initiation of laxatives and
antitussive agents.  However, she had worsening pain on the day
of presentation.  Of note, her family notes that she has been
increasing somnolent and confused lately, and has also had
decreased po intake.
.
On arrival to the ED, she was found to have an O2 sat of 55% on
room air but her VS were otherwise stable (Temp 98, BP 140/85,
RR 20-24).  She was mentating appropriately, A&O x 3, and though
her primary complaint was abdominal pain and she described no
subjective SOB, fevers, chills, cough, or chest pain, her
evaluation focused on her hypoxia.  She was placed on a NRB with
a subsequent O2 sat > 90%.  On exam, she was found to be wheezy
with decreased BS bilaterally, and was thought to have an asthma
exacerbation, for which she was given nebs, steroids, and
azithro 500mg x 1 after blood cx were sent.  An EKG was
performed and demonstrated pseudonormalization of t waves in
V2-V6.  CEs were sent, though she denied CP, and the first set
was negative.  She was later placed on a 50% ventimask and had
an O2 sat of 96% at that time.  A CXR was also performed and was
negative for any acute process and no evidence of
hyperinflation.  Two PIVs were placed.
.
Of note, during her prior hospitalization, she was found to have
a room air sat in the 70s% and 75% on 2L.
.
ROS otherwise negative.

currently working. She denies any tob/etoh/illicit drug use.

.
EKG [**2124-2-21**]: Unchanged from prior.  Sinus rhythm.  Right axis
deviation.
.
CXR [**2124-2-21**]: Stable cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular
congestion. Pulmonary arterial hypertension with evidence of
right heart failure. No change.
.
[**2-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary
arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: advanced cor pulmonale

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 58 year old morbidly obese woman with obesity
hypoventilation syndrome/OSA/Asthma resulting in marked
obstructive lung disease, moderate restrictive lung disease
secondary to obesity, and severe pulmonary hypertension and
severe right failure. She presented with acute on subacute
abdominal pain, and incidentally was noted to be hypoxic and
hypercapnic.
.
# Hypoxia: The working diagnosis was acute asthma exacerbation
with component of pulmonary edema.  Patient also has severe
pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale noted on 2D echo.  She
was treated for asthma exacerbation in the ICU with short
overnight stay. Her CO2 was noted to be 85 with marked
respiratory alkalosis compensating for respiratory acidosis. She
presented with O2 requirement of ~10L compared to her home
regimen of 2-4L.  VBG showed baseline chronic respiratory
acidosis with metabolic compensation. The CXR was unchanged with
no focal abnormalities or new effusions. She had evidence of
wheezing on exam. She was treated with bronchodilators,
steroids, and night CPAP.  She was continued on sildenafil for
pulmonary hypertension.  An echocardiogram showed advanced cor
pulmonale.  She was also continued on her home dose of
torsemide. Her O2 requirement went back to baseline and she was
discharged with home oxygen.  She will complete a prednisone
taper as an outpatient.  Patient should follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] from Pulmonary for further assessment.
.
# Abdominal pain:  In regards to her abdomina pain, she had
recent abdominal CT at [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Hospital1 18**] with no acute issues found
on the CT. The pain started after coughing and she thought that
she had disrupted her mesh. She actually had gastric bypass
surgery in [**2113**], s/p abdominal hernia repair in [**5-/2119**] with a
mesh placement. In [**7-1**] she had a fat necrosis and separation of
incision for which she had a complex repair. During her last
hospitalization, abdominal wall pain was diagnosed. During this
hospitalization we obtained GI consult who recommended surgical
consultation.  MRI of the abdomen was considered for further
evaluation.  However, upon discussion with the radiology team,
they felt that an MRI would not reveal any pathology that could
not be seen on The CT scan that was already done.  Surgery felt
that there was no evidence of hernia on prior CT (recent).  They
felt she most likely had muscular pain from coughing
