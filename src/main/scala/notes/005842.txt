Admission Date:  [**2122-7-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2122-7-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2045-1-19**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a
77-year-old female with a history of hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart
failure who presented from an outside hospital on [**2122-7-11**]
complaining of increased shortness of breath much beyond her
baseline.  She visited her primary care doctor's office one
week prior who though it might be a pneumonia and gave her
Keflex.  Her symptoms did not improve.  She presented to the
outside hospital Emergency Room.

In the Emergency Room there she was noted to have ascites,
INR of 9, mild shortness of breath, no chest pain, no nausea
or vomiting.  Her hospital course there was notable for
treatment of Lasix with minimal response.  By hospital day
number two at the outside hospital the patient was still
dyspneic.  Little improvement was noted.  The atrial
fibrillation continued with some rate control.  She had
moderate ascites on a CT scan but no masses.

On [**2122-7-14**], the patient was noted to have a large
pericardial effusion on echocardiogram with no evidence of
tamponade or right heart collapse.  The effusion was found to
be approximately 3 cm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  History of multiple pneumoniae.
3.  Pulmonary hypertension with some parenchymal lung
disease.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin.
2.  Tenormin.
3.  Cardia XL.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  In the CCU,
her blood pressure was 121/81, heart rate 112, respirations
31.  She was saturating 97% on a nonrebreather.  General:
The patient was lying in bed, breathing laboriously, 8 cm of
JVD was appreciated.  She had no lymphadenopathy.  Chest:
Decreased air entry, crackles at both bases about one-third
of the way up.  Cardiac:  Notable for an irregular rhythm,
normal S1, S2, and a soft systolic murmur along the left
sternal border.  Abdomen:  Distended, nontender, bowel sounds
hypoactive.  her abdomen was also found to be dull to
percussion.  Extremities:  Warm.  Her DP pulse on the left
was about 2+ and 1+ on the right.  She had no edema.
Neurologic:  Nonfocal.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA: On admission, sodium 130,
potassium 6.2, BUN 75, creatinine 1.9, INR 2.3.

An EKG was performed and shown to be consistent with atrial
fibrillation.

A chest x-ray showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette
consistent with a pericardial effusion and a large
right-sided pleural effusion on the right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day number two, the patient had
a pericardiocentesis and 640 cc of hemorrhagic fluid was
removed.  The patient was found to be in severe tamponade
with equalization of pressures that was subsequently relieved
with the pericardiocentesis.  After pericardiocentesis, her
cardiac output went from 3.7 to 8.1.  Her cardiac index went
from 2.2 to 4.8.  Her right atrial pressure went from 21 to
18.  Her pulmonary arterial pressure remained unchanged.  Her
wedge pressure went from 46 to 37.  Her INR was slowly
trending down throughout her hospital admission.

On hospital day number two, the INR had trended down from 2.0
to 1.7.  By hospital day number three, her pericardial drain
was removed.  Her swan was removed.  A lateral decubitus
chest x-ray showed little layering of pleural fluid.  She was
given 20 mg of Lasix the previous afternoon and that put out
1.6 liters approximately.

An Infectious Disease consult was brought on board on
hospital day number three as well to investigate the etiology
of her ascites as well as her pleural effusions.  Her
pericardial fluid showed no growth of bacterial, AFB or
fungal cultures.

On hospital day number four, a pleural tap was performed to
drain the right-sided pleural effusion; approximately 1 liter
of hemorrhagic fluid was removed and sent for cytology.  By
hospital day number six, an echocardiogram was performed that
showed no reaccumulation of the pericardial fluid.  Her
atrial fibrillation was being well controlled on Lopressor 50
twice a day and her blood pressure remained stable.

In terms of her pulmonary status, her breathing had improved.
She was discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Full code.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Pericardial effusion.  Cardiac tamponade.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Atenolol 50 mg twice a day.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2122-8-6**] at 2:30.
