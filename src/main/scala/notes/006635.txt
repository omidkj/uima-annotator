Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the left main
coronary artery
Intra-aortic Balloon pump placment


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2643**] is a 86 yo M w/ h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, dCHF, mild to
moderate AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2 [**11-10**]) who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with CP.

.
Of note, he gets most of his care at the VA so there are limited
records available at this time. At [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], he c/o
progressive DOE, SOB and CP episodes which were originally with
exertion but over the past 1 wk progressed to occur with minimal
exertion. On [**4-17**], CP occurred at rest. He has had assoc nausea
but no vomitting. No fevers, chills, cough, dizziness, focal
weakness, numbness, tingling. He apparently had a stress at the
VA [**3-27**] but per the AOD, these results are not yet reported in
the VA system.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], he had EKG changes including ST
depressions in V2-6, I, II. After NTG x2 he was pain free. He
was started on Hep gtt. Cr was 2.6 (baseline 2.2) so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible stress prior to cath. Just
prior to transfer, his CP recurred. He was started on NTG gtt.
Of note, he also got 2gm magnesium there.
.
On arrival to the floor, pt initially c/o [**3-13**] CP but after
titration of NTG, is CP free and feeling "fine". Pt c/o L>R leg
swelling for several yrs but this is not worse lately. C/o
feeling cold often esp in afternoons but no constipation, wt
gain.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he
denies recent fevers. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Imaging:
Cardiac Cath ([**2166-4-18**]):
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrates three vessel coronary artery disease. The left main

coronary artery is a heavily calcified vessel that contains a
near-ostial 85% stenosis. The left anterior desceding is a
moderately
calcified vessel withich contains a proximal 30% lesoin. The
first
diagonal contains a 40-50% ostial lesion. The second diagnonal
contains
a 60% lesion at the origin of the vessel and a 40% lesion
further down.
The circumflex artery contains an ostial 40% lesion and a 50%
lesion
more distally, at the OM1 bifurcation. The distal circumflex
artery
gives off a posterior left ventricular branch, with 60%
stensosis at its
origin. The right coronary arteyr contains a 50% lesion at its
oreigin.
2. Abdominal aortography demonstrates no renal artery stenoiss,
and
diffuse plaquing of the vessel as well as heavy calcification of
hte
right CFA.
3. Hemodynamics deomonstrate elevated left ventricular filling
pressures, moderate aortic stenosis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.
Cardiac TTE ([**2166-4-19**]):
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
Chest CT ([**2166-4-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Atherosclerotic calcification involving the thoracic aorta
with dimensions as detailed above. Calcified aortic valve.
2. Large hiatal hernia.
3. Cholelithiasis.
4. Diverticulosis.
.
Cardiac Cath ([**2166-4-20**]): Logged only -> report pending
.
Carotid Ultra-sound ([**2166-4-21**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. 70-79% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. 60-69% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2643**] is an 86 year-old man with a history of HTN,
hyperlipidemia, dCHF, moderate AS who presented with NSTEMI and
found to have left main disease on cardiac catheterization.
After allowing patient and family to consider CABG vs. PCI he
required temproary placement of IABP for symptom control and one
day later received [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**] to left main artery with
removal of IABP.

# CORONARIES: Mr. [**Known lastname 2643**] presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with CP
consistent with NSTEMI, he was subsequently transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
and was admitted to the cardiac floor. He was CP-free the
morning after admission and was continued on medical management
with heparin gtt, Plavix, ASA, atorvastatin 80, and metopro
