Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2078**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath x2
arterial line


History of Present Illness:
72 M with h/o COPD, HTN, seizure disorder, cardiomyopathy (EF
15-30%), transferred from OSH after admission for worsening SOB,
+enzyme leak on [**11-13**], treated for CHF exacerbation with
diuresis, subsequently +persantine-stress showing global
hypokinesis. Cath was apparently deferred [**3-6**] increased
creatinine and ?need for CABG.
.
Pt presented on [**11-13**] with ~3-4d history of worsening SOB. Pt
describes gradual onset over past ~1 year history of worsening
SOB. +smoker, quit ~10 yrs ago. +cough, non-productive. no
fever/chills. pt denies cp/palpitations. His SOB is elicited by
exertion only, does not occur at rest. he denies orthopnea, pnd,
lower extremity edema.
.
Upon admission to OSH, VS: 109/81 93, 22, 90%2L. CK 140, cre
1.2, INR 1.4, BNP 2081. pt noted to have troponin 1.24 (0-0.1
range nl), ?pulmonary edema on CXR. Pt started on lovenox,
diuresed with lasix, with subsequent BNP decrease to 1040. EKG
showed ?lateral TWI per report (on review shows ?STD V2-V5 with
TWI). Plan had been to cath pt at OSH, however initially
deferred because of rising crt with diuresis. TTE showed global
hypokinesis.  Stress test on [**11-17**] also showed depressed EF.  Pt
was trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ?Cath with or without CABG.  His
SOB has improved since his admission on [**11-13**], and he denies any
repeat occurence of chest tightness, pressure, pain.

Past Medical History:
recent NSTEMI - no intervention at osh [**3-6**] ?cabg.

STUDIES:

[**2127-11-19**] Cardiac Cath
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderately elevated right sided filling pressures.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
5. Moderately severe depression of cardiac output.
6. Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
7. 2+ mitral regurgitation.

[**2127-11-25**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. The mid RCA lesion was predilated with 1.5 and 2.0 mm
balloons,
stented with two 2.25 mm bare metal stents and post dilated with
the
stent balloon.( See PTCA comments)
2. The proxmal RCA lesion was direcly stented with a 2.25 mm
balloon and
post dilated with a 2.5 mm balloon. Distally we deployed a
trapped 2.25
X 12 Mini vision stent, originally intended to the distal RCA
lesion.
The stents were post dilated with a 2.75 mm balloon,.(see PTCA
comments)
3. The distl RCA lesion was stented with a 2.25 X 08 mm
MIcrodriver
stent.  (see PTCA comments)
The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual
stenosis, no
dissection, no perforation and no embolisation. The patient left
the lab
in a stable condition. (see PTCA comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful stenting of the RCA (bare metal)
.
[**2127-11-26**] CXR: Mild interstitial edema and small right pleural
effusion have increased. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Hyperinflation indicates severe COPD and diaphragmatic
calcification probably due to asbestos exposure.
.
[**2127-11-17**] CXR (OSH): mild congestive changes cannot be excluded,
no definte infiltrates, no pleural effusions.
.
[**2127-11-18**] EKG: ?STE V2, unchanged from [**11-13**] EKG, STD V3-V5, Q's
in inferior leads, ?R v1.
[**2127-11-13**] EKG (OSH): STD v1, v2, v4, v5. ?sI, qIII, tIII.
.
.
[**2127-11-14**] TTE - limited study, LV dilated, normal thikcness,
globally hypokinetic, EF 15-20%, no segmental WMA. RV dilated,
hypokinetic, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6878**], RA dilated. moderate MR, no AS/AI. mild
TR, RVSP 53mmhg.
.
.
[**2127-11-17**] - persantine myoview nuclear study (OSH):
large inferior wall infarct, reversible ischemia affecting the
anterior wall, marked LV dilation with global hypokinesia. EF
17%.
.
.
[**2127-7-24**] ([**Hospital1 **]) MyoView stress test - dilated LV at rest &
stress. large inferior wall infarct without ischemia.
significant inferior wall hypokinesis with diffuse global
hypokinesis of the remaining walls. EF 32%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] medicine service in hemodynamically
stable condition, without chest pain, with ongoing shortness of
breath.
.
.
# CAD - pt reports no known prior h/o CAD.  Stress test from
[**7-8**] showed depressed EF (15-30%).  TTE on [**11-17**] showed EF
15-20% with global hypokinesis.  Etiology of cardiomyopathy
initially unclear: most likely ischemic though alcohol-related
also possible given alcohol history.  Disease burden on cardiac
cath--90% disease LAD, LCX, RCA--made ischemic etiology even
more probable.  Because pt's diffuse disease, he was evaluated
by cardiothoaric surgery service. He and his family ultimately
declined CABG given the high risk of the procedure.  Pt
underwent percutaneous intervention with revascularization.
Post-cath, the pt was transferred to the CCU for
hypotension--cause unclear (?[**Name2 (NI) 69085**] vs cardiogenic).  He
was transferred back to the floor pre-discharge.  He was
continued on a regimen of aspirin, plavix, coreg and lisinopril.
 Spirinolactone was discontinued. His rythym was normal sinus
during his hospital course.
.
# CHF: Pt initially presented with florid CHF to OSH.  Troponin
was 1.24, BNP 2080. He was diuresed with significant symptomatic
improvement.  As above, echocardiogram showed an EF 15-20%,
bilateral ventricle dilation & hypokinesis, but no significant
valvular disease.  He was started on lisinopril pre-cath;
however, this was discontinued post-cath secondary to relative
hypotension--with plans to restart as an outpatient.
Similiarly, the pt was not discharged with lasix as his blood
pressure had been low post-cath and he did not seem overloaded.
Pt did tolerate Toprol.
.
# anemia - pt noted to have hct 38-41 @ OSH, dropped to 34 after
heparin started.  no obvious source of bleeding, guaiac negative
pre-cath.  iron studies suggest some component of iron
deficiency.  smear and hemolysis labs (ldh, hapto, LFTs) (-).
hct was stable cath.
.
## htn: pt has long h/o htn, apparently controlled previously
with lisinopril only.  Pt became relatively [**Name2 (NI) 69086**]
post-cath, able to tolerate only b-blocker.
.
# NEURO - ?right carotid pulse absent on admission, however
carotid doppler shows patent vessel, <40% stenosis.  no h/o
TIA/CVA.  pt family noted [**11-19**] pt is a bit more confused,
speech a little more garbled than usual.  No neurological
deficits previously, or on current exam [**11-22**] (5/5 strength
triceps, biceps, delts, wrists, dorsoflexion, plantarflexion,
toes downgoing.  28/30 on mini-mental status exam (can't count
back [**Hospital1 **] from 100 by 7s).  no new meds.  Transient confusion
thought to be most likely [**3-6**] sundowning as is worse in PM, and
subsequently stabilized.

# COPD - unclear if pt has underl
