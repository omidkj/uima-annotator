Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of intubation with
pneumonia who presents with dyspnea and hypertension from
nursing home.

In the ED, T 98.1 BP 209/81 HR 60 RR 15 02 98% 2L. While in the
ED the patient had hypertension to the 220s with normal 02 sat
on arrival. The patient was treated with hydralazine and lasix
(10 mg) as well as nitro paste. However, pt had decreased mental
status with hypercarbia on ABG. For concern of RUL infiltrate on
CXR, the patient was given vancomycin and cefepime. In the ED

nitropaste with dramatic fluctuation in BP from 220s to 110s
after medical interventions. admitted to rehab on [**1-12**] for ABX

Urine culture ([**1-31**]): MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY
TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
Urine culture ([**2-2**]): negative
Blood culture x2 ([**1-31**]): NGTD

ECG ([**1-31**]): Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. Left
bundle-branch block.

CXR ([**1-31**]):
1. Interval increase in pulmonary vascular markings, right more
than left,
likely representing asymmetric pulmonary edema.
2. More focal opacity within the right upper lobe may also
reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but pneumonia is also a
possibility.

Echo ([**2-1**]): Mild symmetric LVH, EF 70%. Increased LV filling
pressure moderate LV diastolic dysfunction. Moderate AS (area
1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Respiratory distress: Received vancomycin and cefepime in the
ER, but these were held as she had no WBC elevation, fever, or
cough to suggest pneumonia. She initially was hypercarbic and
required BiPAP in the ICU, although was quickly weaned. She was
also noted to have pulmonary edema, likely exacerbated by her
marked hypertension. Rapid improvement was noted with IV
furosemide. However, she redeveloped respiratory distress with
SBP of 205, and was again treated with BiPAP and IV furosemide
with good response. She subsequently was stable on nasal cannula
and transitioned to PO furosemide 20mg daily. She was also
continued on her outpatient tiotropium and fluticasone for COPD.

2) Hypertension: She was initially treated with her home
medications and prn hydralazine. Her SBP improved and averaged
140-160, but with occasoinal transient elevation to 180-190. Her
hydralazine was changed from q12 to q6, nifedipine held for low
HR, and lisinopril started and increased to 10mg daily. She may
need further uptitration of these meds as an outpatient.

3) UTI: Treated empirically with a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin
for a floridly positive UA and history of sensitive E coli.
Urine culture showed contamination and repeat culture was
negative.

4) Aortic stenosis / chronic diastolic HF: Repeat echo showed
aortic valve area 1.0-1.2 cm2. Her home meds were continued with
the hydralazine change and new ACE-I as noted above.

5) ARF: Baseline creatinine ~1.0-1.2. Her creatinine peaked at
1.7, likely from IV diuresis. When switched to 20mg daily lasix,
her creatinine improved to 1.1.

6) Anemia: Remained stable at her baseline of upper 20s to low
30s. Retics were low, B12 and folate normal, and iron studies
nonspecific, although perhaps suggestive of anemia of chronic
disease.

7) Metabolic alkalosis: Likely from contraction alkalosis from
furosemide +/- posthypercapneic alkalosis. Anion gap as low as 1
was unusual in setting of minimally low albumin, normal Ca Mg
Phos, although further workup was deferred based on goals of
care discussion below.

8) Goals of care: Patient expressed repeated desire to die,
although denied depression or suicidality. She stated her health
is terrible and she is a burden on her family. Also, she no
longer enjoys the things she used to with her poor hearing and
vision. She does not want to return to rehab. A DNR/DNI order
was placed. After discussion between patient, palliative care,
patient's son/HCP, and primary team, it was decided that the
patient would be happiest at home with home services via
hospice. Patient also discussed this with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 20 years,
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name **]. Hospice of Good [**Doctor Last Name 9995**] was notified and a
Russian-speaking nurse came to meet with the patient and her
son. They are in agreement with the plan to discharge home with
hospice.
