Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with history of afib,with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 50935**] admitted to
[**Location (un) 620**] for PR prolongation/Weinchebach on ECG with blood
cultures showing GPCs, murmur and concern for endocarditis
effecting the conducting system.

Active Issues:
# Endocarditis: The patient was transferred from an OSH where he
had presented with fevers and malaise.  Exam revealed a MR
murmur and blood cultures were positive for group B
streptococcus.  TTE at [**Hospital1 18**] indicated a probably mitral valve
vegetation, however, a TEE could not be performed due to
obstruction in the hypopharynx preventing passage of scope.
Patient was initially treated with vancomycin due to history of
penicillin allergy. He was desensitized to penicillin on HD3.
He tolerated desensitization without issue and was continued on
a course of penicillin, with intention to treat for 6 weeks.  On
HD5, a PICC was placed for administration of antibiotics as
outpatient.  Surveillance cultures performed from admission
through HD3 were negative to date at the time of discharge.

#Type I Second degree AV block: On admission, patient had EKG
demonstrating type I second degree AV block.  Given clinical
picture this was concerning for endocarditis with abscess
affecting the conducting system. Given concern for possible
extension of disease, a temporary pacer wire was placed by EP on
the day of admission. On interrogation of pacer prior to
discharge, patient continued to have type I second degree AV
block.  EP will continue to follow this patient following
discharge, and will internalize pacemaker once antibiotic course
is completed.

# h/o arial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation, for which he is on warfarin.  During admission,
patient had one brief episode of atrial fibrillation with normal
rate, otherwise was in sinus rhythm with AV block as above.
Warfarin was held briefly for placement of pacer, and then
restarted. INR was followed daily and warfarin was dosed as
necessary to keep patient therapeutic.  Patient was discharged
on 2 mg warfarin. INR on the day of discharge was 2.1.

#Diastolic congestive heart failure:  Patient had no signs of
fluid overload on exam at the time of admission.  He continued
to appear euvolemic throughout admission.  TTE showed normal
biventricular global systolic function.  Patient was continued
on home metolazone and torsemide.  These medications were held
in the setting of increasing creatinine, and no signs of volume
overload. He was restarted on [**12-13**] his home dose of metolazone
(20 mg) at the time of discharge.  Metolazone was not restarted.


#Urinary retention:  Patient has a history of benign prostatic
hypertension.  On HD5, patient had a bladder scan which revealed
1L of retained urine.  A foley was placed with plan to leave in
place for one week (ending [**2179-7-29**]).  Patient was started on
flomax, and was continued on this medication at the time of
discharge.

#Gouty flare: On HD7, patient complained of MCP pain, warmth and
redness.  Exam was consistent with a gouty flare.  In the
setting of the patient's bactermia and acute on chronic kidney
failure, pain was treated with tylenol and ultram.

Chronic Issues:
# Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on home levothyroxine
throughout admission

# CKD stage III baseline Cr 1.5 to 1.6: Pts creatinine was lower
than baseline at the time of admission (1.0).  It did trend
upward to a maximum value of 1.7 in the setting of urinary
retention.  However Cr trended downward with relief of
obstruction and was 1.0 at the time of discharge.

#Transitional Issues:
- Confirmed DNR/DNI code status
- Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for internalization of pacemaker.
-Follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from infectious disease
for monitoring of antibiotics
- Foley catheter should be removed on [**2179-7-29**].  Patient was
continued on flomax at the time of discharge for BPH.  Please
evaluate for ongoing signs of urinary retention.
