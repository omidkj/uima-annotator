Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective PCI for three-vessel disease complicated by dissection
of Left Main

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization x2 with stents to the right coronary
artery, Left main artery, Left anterior descending artery,
obtuse marginal artery.


History of Present Illness:
This 75 year old woman has a history of obesity, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, CAD and [**Location (un) 3484**] syndrome with longstanding
steroid use and subsequent development of DM. On [**2132-10-16**] she
underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 2358**] [**2-26**] anginal sx
and an abnormal ETT. Angiography revealed three vessel disease
with a 50%stenosis of the RCA, 40% LM, 80-90% stenosis of her
OM1 and OM2, and a 90% stenosis of distal LAD. LVEF was noted at
60%.
.
She has since been evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from cardiac
surgery. Studies have revealed no usable lower extremity veins
for CABG. In addition, it is felt that Mrs.[**Known lastname 24469**] is quite
high
risk for sternal complications.  Plans were for PCI of the RCA,
OM1 and OM2 by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] with possible LIMA to LAD by
CTsurg at a later date.
.
During her catherization today her RCA was stented and while
trying to stent the OM's the Left Main was dissected then
stented. She denies any chest pain, and her EKG was not
concerning for evolving MI. Biomarkers were negative int he
immediate post-procedure period.

Cardiac catheterization [**2132-12-14**]:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LMCA, LAD, Lcx and RCA stents.
3. Significant OM1 lesion with flow.
4. STEMI lateral.
5. Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
6. Normal cardiac index.
7. Successful PCI of OM1 with BMSx2.
.
[**2132-12-15**] Echo:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls
and akinesis of the distal inferior, septal, and anterior walls.
The apex is mildly dyskinetic. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2043-12-12**], the
basal inferolateral and inferior walls are now hypokinetic. The
anterior wall function and global systolic function are slightly
improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 YO woman with CAD SP PCI of RCA and OM's complicated by
dissection of left main with subsequent stenting and right
radial hematoma.
.
# CAD: No angina or ST elevations immediately following first
catheterization. CKMB is mildly elevated which could be evidence
of evolving MI. Will obtain echo and trend biomarkers. The
patient had to return to the cath lab for revision of original
procedure. On [**2132-12-12**], the patient's sedation was lifted and
she was extubated. She almost immediately [**Doctor First Name **] to complain of
chest pain. ECG showed ST elevations, and she was brought to
cath lab again. Selective coronary angiography of her right
dominant system revealed three-vessel CAD. The LMCA had patent
stents with persistent dissection outside stents. The LAD had
patent stents with diffuse distal disease. The LCx had patent
stents; the OM1 had reopened since prior cath had had a 95%
proximal stenosis with associated limited dissection from prior.
The RCA had patent stents with a 95% PDA stenosis present on
prior
films. Successful PTCA and stenting of large OM1 with two
overlapping 2.25x12 MiniVision bare metal stents postdilated to
2.5mm. The [**Hospital 228**] medical management included aspirin,
Plavix, simvastatin, metoprolol and ezetimibe. She will be on
Plavix for the rest of her life. Do not stop Plavix without
first speaking to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] at [**Hospital1 18**]. Her peak CK was 4332
in the setting of extensive chest pain and manipulation of
coronary arteries. Her creatinine increased to 1.3 after
contrast load, currently at 1.2.
.
# Acute systolic Dysfunction: The echocardiogram of [**2132-12-15**]
showed reduced LVEF of 30% in the setting of STEMI. Although
cardiac catheterization showed high filling pressures, she has
appeared euvolemic with no signs of fluid overload and has not
required standing diuretics. Her Lisinopril was decreased to 5
mg daily. she should have daily weights and close monitoring of
her fluid status.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: Noted in the setting of MI. Currently in
AF with frequent bradycardia at night, she is asymptomatic with
these episodes. She is on very low dose metoprolol for MI
prevention  but this can be discontinued if HR cont to be an
issue. Extensive discussion regarding coumadin. Decision made to
treat with ASA and Plavix only given hx of falls and likelihood
that EF will increase in the long term.
.
# Radial Hematoma: Resolving. No symptoms of compartment
syndrome (pain, cap refill, pulses) we
