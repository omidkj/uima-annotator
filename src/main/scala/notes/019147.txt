Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH: s/p tPA for right MCA stroke


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
51 year-old right-handed man with a PMHx of Afib (for the
past 5 years s/p cardioversion x2, not on coumadin) and
hyperlipidemia presented to [**Hospital6 204**] after an
acute onset of left-sided weakness. According to history taken
from patient and his sister, he was at home on [**2200-1-29**]. He had
been to the gym around 4pm and had worked out for approximately
1.5 hours doing auerobic exercise in addition to free-weights
which does not typically do. He returned home and was able to
drive and navigate back, at which point he shoveled part of his
deck outside of his house. According to his sister he had
reported some muscle aches following the exercise and shoveling,
but no headaches and no neck pain specifically. His friend (who
is a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital3 **]) came over and they were eating
pizza. At that time Mr. [**Known lastname 31251**] went to the fridge (around 6pm)
and dropped something from his left hand. He attempted to pick
it
up again using his left hand however he dropped it again. His
friend looked at him at this point and thought that he had a
left
facial droop. He was asked to hold up his arms which he could
not
do. She also felt that he was dysarthric at this time. 911 was
called and he was brought to [**Hospital3 **].

At the hospital he was noted to have a left hemiparesis and CT
showed a dense R MCA sign (by report - no images available) and
90 mg of tPA was administered at 20:50. According to his sister,
she said that his arm and leg on the left began to move again
and
his facial droop improved. While he was in the ED, he was
supposedly reaching for his phone in his pocket when he fell out
of bed on the floor. He hit the left side of his head and his
left shoulder. He had another CT at that time and (by report)
there was no evidence of bleed. He was taken to the ICU for
post-tPA monitoring and arrangement was made for transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**]. He was in atrial fibrillation at the outside hospital and
may have received digoxin (by nursing report, but not
documented). He did receive diltiazem, but by report his
systolic
bp dipped. He was then given digoxin 0.5 mg prior to transport.

L hemibody in the arm and leg; full sensation to light otuch,
pinprick and vibration on the R side
Coordination: intact on the R side w/ FNF and HTF - no
dysmetria;
unable to test on the L due to hemiplegia

MRI head:
IMPRESSION:

1. Acute/subacute infarction involving the right basal ganglia,
right
inferior frontal lobe, anteroinferior temporal lobe and the
right parietal
lobe. There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.

2. Thrombus in the M1 segment of right MCA.


shoulder XR
Three views of the left shoulder show no fracture or
dislocation.
The adjacent clavicle and ribs are intact. Small bone island in
the scapula  is of no clinical concern. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural thickening in  the imaged portion of the chest.

Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 31251**] was admitted as an OSH transfer for acute Right side
MCA stroke s/p Tpa within 3 hour window. At [**Hospital1 18**] he was not
observe to improve in terms of his left sided dense hemiplegia.
He was also noted to have a-fib with rvr. As an outpatient, he
was already on beta blockers but not on coumadin. Once 24 hours
had passed from the end of the ivTPA infusion, he was started on
aspirin 325mg daily. He was subsequently started on Dabigatran
150mg [**Hospital1 **] for secondary stroke prophylaxis (to protect against
atrial fibrillation). Aspirin was continued for two days and
then stopped.

He continued to have a HR >100 and cardiology was called. They
recommended that we discontinue the digoxin, and place him on
metoprolol tartrate 50mg TID instead of Toprol XL 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. The
Cardiology team also recommended that we discontinue Sotalol. On
the evening prior to discharge ([**2-4**]), the patient developped a
low grade temp of 100.7 F. On [**2-5**] he developed a WBC of 12. On
CXR there was a possible pneumonia identified in the right lower
lobe. He was started on a floroquinolone (Avelox) x 7 days. He
was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] [**Location (un) 86**] for continued care.
There were no acute problems or complications during this
hospitalization.
