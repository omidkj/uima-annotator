HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year-old
gentleman with a history of cardiomyopathy, congestive heart
failure with an EF less then 10%, coronary artery disease,
atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency on a cardiac
transplant list admitted to the neurosurgery service on
[**2132-8-31**] preop revision for a C3-C5 arthrodesis and a
lateral mass and rod fixation.  The patient underwent a C3-C5
arthrodesis on the lateral mass screw fixation on [**2133-8-6**]
without intraoperative complications.  The patient was
discharged to home in stable condition and returns now for a
failed left sided C3 lateral mass screw.  The patient is
preop for revision of that fusion.  The patient was
complaining of some bilateral numbness in the upper
extremities.  He was admitted for intravenous heparin,
discontinued off his Coumadin and placed in cervical
traction.  At the onset of cervical traction the patient
began complaining of increased numbness in the upper
extremities bilaterally. He subsequently complained of decreased
grip on the left side.  On examination he had mild left intrinsic
weakness relative to the right and mild difficulty with left hip
flexion.  He was
taken out of the traction and placed back in a hard collar.
At 7:45 the patient developed acute onset of significant
quadriparesis and labored respiratory rate despite being
taken out of traction.  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable, but was emergently fiberoptically intubated and
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring
and was started on high dose Solu-Medrol drip.

On [**2132-9-3**] the patient was awake, following commands and
opening his eyes, mouthing words and internally rotating his
legs to stimulation.  Not moving his feet.  Spontaneous
shoulder movements bilaterally.  No hand movements. He did
spike a temperature to 103.2 and was fully cultured.  His
sputum had 1+ gram positive cocci in pairs.  On [**9-4**] his
condition had deteriorated. He developed new pleural effusion
with respiratory compromise and requiring increased
ventilatory support.  Neurologically he had no compelling
improvement in his motor examination.  No upper extremity
motor function, 1 out of 5 strength to noxious stimulations,
able to internal rotate bilateral lower extremities weakly 2
out of 5.  On [**2132-9-3**] he continues to open his eyes to
voice moving both legs to command, 2 out of 5 with no
antigravity strength.  His arms were flaccid.  He was
internally rotating his left arm to stimulation, but not the
right arm.  His cardiomyopathy continued to worsen. He was
requiring full ventilatory support with bilateral pleural
effusions and worsening congestive heart failure.

On [**2132-9-8**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] had a meeting with the family to
discuss the grave prognosis of the patient's condition.  The
family decided to withdraw support and the patient was taken
off ventilatory support.  The time of death is [**2154**] on
[**2133-9-8**].
