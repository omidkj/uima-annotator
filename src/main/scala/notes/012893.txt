Service:  Neonatology

INTERIM PERIOD COVERING FROM [**2143-6-2**] THROUGH [**2143-8-1**]:

HISTORY:  Please refer to the previously dictated admission
and interim summary by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 48249**] for full details.

Briefly, [**Known lastname 48250**] is a former 25-1/7 week female infant born to
a 35-year-old gravida 6, para 1, now 2 mother with
unremarkable prenatal screens except for GBS unknown.  [**Known lastname 48250**]
was delivered by cesarean section, given progressive cervical
dilatation in the setting of premature rupture of membranes
and footling breech.  Delivery was uncomplicated and she
emerged with a spontaneous cry.  Her Apgar scores were 7 at
one minute and 8 at five minutes.  She was subsequently
admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further
management of prematurity.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  1. Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname 48250**]
remained cardiovascularly stable during this interim period.
An intermittent murmur was observed on day of life 61, which
was likely a flow murmur.  No cardiac work-up was done at
this point.

2. Respiratory:  [**Known lastname 48250**] was initially intubated in the
Delivery Room and responded well to two doses of surfactant
and weaned to nasal CPAP.  On day of life 11 she was
reintubated for increased work of breathing.  She
subsequently developed moderate cloudy secretion via her
endotracheal tube and a tracheal aspirate sent on day of life
15 had revealed Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative rods,
at which time she was treated for presumed tracheitis.
However her respiratory status continued to worsen requiring
increased ventilatory support.  On day of life 20, given
progressively worsening work of breathing and CO2 retention
despite escalating ventilatory support, she was switched from
conventional ventilation to high-frequency oscillating
ventilation, as well as starting on Combivent for possible
bronchospastic component to her respiratory distress.  A
repeat tracheal aspirate sent on day of life 21 had
subsequently grown Klebsiella, E. coli and Pseudomonas.  She
remained on high-frequency oscillator until day of life 30,
when she self-extubated and she did well on nasal CPAP of 6.
Caffeine was started at that time with discontinuation of
Combivent.  She was subsequently weaned from nasal CPAP to
nasal cannula on day of life 36 and to room air on day of
life 47.  On room air she rarely had an apneic and
bradycardic episodes while she remained on caffeine.  On day
of life 62, she was reintubated for laser eye surgery and
subsequently extubated to nasal cannula on day of life 63.
She went back to her baseline room air on day of life 65 and
caffeine was discontinued on day of life 67 given minimal
apnea of prematurity, and she has been stable on room air for
the four days prior to this dictation.

3. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 48250**] continued to
advance on calories and was on 30 calories with ProMod on day
of life 20, when she developed severe respiratory distress
requiring switching from conventional ventilation to
high-frequency oscillator ventilation.  She was made n.p.o.
at that time until day of life 30, when she was restarted on
enteral feeds and tolerated gradual advancement.  She was
briefly made n.p.o. around the time of her laser surgery and
subsequently resumed enteral feeds without any difficulties.
She is currently on total fluids 150 cc per kg per day,
taking breast milk 32 with ProMod p.o. p.g. with occasional
breast-feeding.  She has been gaining weight well.  Her birth
weight was 695 grams.  Her weight on the day of this
dictation is 1,800 grams.  She has been stooling well,
requiring occasional glycerin suppositories.

4. GI:  [**Known lastname 48250**] was started on phototherapy for initial
bilirubin level of 3.6.  She continued phototherapy until day
of life 11 at which time phototherapy was discontinued and a
recheck of bilirubin on day of life 12 was 1.7.

5. Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname 48250**] completed an initial 48-hour
rule out sepsis course of ampicillin and gentamicin.  On day
of life 11, given increased respiratory distress, another
blood culture was obtained which remained no growth to date.
She completed 48 hours of antibiotic treatment with
vancomycin and gentamicin.  On day of life 15 she developed
worsening respiratory distress despite ventilatory support
and a tracheal aspirate at that time grew Staphylococcus
aureus and Gram-negative rods.  She was started on vancomycin
and gentamicin which subsequently was switched to oxacillin
and gentamicin based on sensitivity panel.  Blood culture
obtained on [**2143-6-7**] was negative.  Approximately five days
into her antibiotics course, [**Known lastname 48250**] developed significant
respiratory distress with CO2 retention.  A repeat tracheal
aspirate was sent that grew Klebsiella, E. coli and
Pseudomonas.  Blood culture obtained at that time was
negative.  Her antibiotic regimen was switched from oxacillin
and gentamicin to vancomycin as well as adding ceftazidime.
On [**2143-6-27**] the antibiotic regimen was modified based on the
sensitivity panel, and she remained on ceftazidime and
gentamicin for the remaining 14-day course that she completed
on day of life 29.  A repeat blood culture on [**2143-6-14**] was
negative.  [**Known lastname 48250**] has since then remained off antibiotics and
has had no further infectious issues.  A lumbar puncture
obtained toward the end of the 14-day course for presumed
pneumonia/sepsis, was benign with 6 white blood cells and 24
red blood cells.

6. Neurological:  [**Known lastname 48250**] had a negative head ultrasound on
day of life three, as well as day of life 10.  A follow-up
head ultrasound on day of life 30 was also negative and she
should have another follow-up head ultrasound prior to the
discharge from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

7. Hematology:  [**Known lastname 48251**] initial hematocrit was 44.5.  She is
type B+, Coombs' negative.  On day of life 16 she was
transfused with 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells for an
hematocrit of 26.7.  After obtaining physician consent, she
was transfused again on day of life 21 for an hematocrit of
32.9.  A follow-up post transfusion hematocrit was 41.2 on
day of life 23.  She has not had any blood transfusions since
then and her last hematocrit was on day of life 54 with an
hematocrit of 30.4 and a reticulocyte count of 9.1.

8. Sensory:  A. Audiology - hearing screen has not been
performed during this interim period.  She will require a
hearing screen prior to discharge.

B. Ophthalmology - [**Known lastname 48250**] had her initial ophthalmologic
examination on day of life 42 that revealed a mature retina
in zone 2.  A follow-up examination on day of life 57 showed
that her eyes had progressed to stage 2 with plus disease in
zone 2 which subsequently progressed to prethreshold in zone
1.  She had laser eye surgery on [**2143-7-23**] and a follow-up eye
examination on day of life 69 had shown good reaction to the
laser treatment with resolving plus disease.  However due to
poor viewing of the retina, retinopathy of prematurity was
unable to be staged at this time.  She is to have a follow-up
eye examination on [**2143-8-7**].  She currently remains on
atropine.
