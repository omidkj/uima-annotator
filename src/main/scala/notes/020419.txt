Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of central venous catheter

History of Present Illness:
81F with dementia, chronic saccral decubitus ulcer to the bone
on long term antibiotics, s/p SDH, DM-II with labile blood
sugars, HTN, CAD, PVD, and ESRD on HD admitted from home for
altered mental status. She is barely verbal but responsive at
baseline, but became transiently unresponsive the morning of
admission when transport came to take her to HD. She was taken
to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] where her initial vital signs were 98.0 94/60 66
15 96% on RA. A stat CT head showed a new parietotemporal
hypodensity consistent with acute CVA. Neurology was consulted.
She then became hypotensive to 68/50. She was bolused 1L NS,
given pip-tazo and cipro for double coverage of Pseudomonas. She
was not given an additional dose of vancomycin or other Gram
positive coverage. A subclavian line was placed and she was sent
for a torso CT to eval for sites of infection. The CT showed her
known saccral decubitus ulcer tracking to the bone, a new fluid
collection over the R greater trochanter, and a newly notes
renal lesion concerning for RCC. Her BP stabilized after fluid
bolus and she was never on pressors. General surgery and
orthopedic surgery were consulted regarding her saccral and
trochanteric processes and she was admitted to the MICU service.

verbal. Per her sister who was at the bedside, she is at her
baseline at this point. She denies pain, fevers, chills, or

 Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to tracing #1
there is no significant diagnostic change.
TRACING #2

[**1-5**] CXR

CHEST, UPRIGHT PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW: The left basilar
retrocardiac opacity
is less conspicuous in comparison to nine days prior. There is
no new
airspace consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Cardiac size
remains normal. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Stents
projecting
over the left axilla and the region of the left brachiocephalic
vein are
unchanged, as well as femoral approach [**Month/Year (2) 2286**] catheter and a
percutaneous
gastrostomy tube.

IMPRESSION: Decreased left basilar opacity in comparison to nine
days prior.
No new airspace consolidation.

[**1-5**] CT chest/abd/pelvis


CHEST CT WITH CONTRAST: The thyroid gland is enlarged and
contains multiple
nodules as well as areas of calcification. Moderate amount of
atherosclerotic
calcification of the aorta noted, severe along the coronary
arteries. No
central filling defect in the pulmonary artery is seen. Heart is
not enlarged.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is no mediastinal, hilar
or axillary
lymphadenopathy.

Within the right lung apex, there is a 10-mm nodule which is new
