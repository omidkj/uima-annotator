History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of
CAD, hypertension, and schizoaffective disorder who presents
with lightheadedness, and altered mental status noted at her
living facility. On EMS arrival, the patient was noted to be
tachycardic in 170s with SBPs in 90-100s. She complained of
dyspnea and productive cough. No chest pain. No abdominal pain,
nausea, or vomiting. No frequency, urgency, dysuria. The patient
underwent EKG concerning initally for SVT and was given 2 doses
of adenosine without improvement. She was transported to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.
In the ED, initial vital signs 98.1 164 89/45 16 100%. EKG
showed Afib with RVR at 160s LAD Qtc 445. No STEMI. CXR showed
with Right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient received a dose of
vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia. For her tachycardia, she
was bolused with IV fluids for likely profound dehydration. She
received 5 mg IV diltiazem, and was started on a drip at 2.5
mg/hr. She was also started on neosynephrine for hypotension.
During her ED stay, she began to complain of worsening dyspnea.
VS at time of transfer BP 114/50, O2 93% on 4L, RR 30.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient complained of mild chest
pressure. Telemetry with several short runs of V. tach,
bigeminy. Otherwise the patient denied pain.
.

CTA Chest [**9-21**]
 IMPRESSION:
1.  No pulmonary embolism
2.  Chronic right middle lobe collapse
3.  Large hiatal hernia, responsible for left basal atelectasis.

Echo [**9-21**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


ECG [**9-21**]
Narrow complex irregular supraventricular tachycardia. P waves
are difficult
to discern. Occasional ventricular premature contractions.
Possible prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2144-6-3**] supraventricular tachycardia is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of CAD, hypertension, and
schizoaffective disorder admitted with atrial tachycardia and
concern for pneumonia.
.
1. Arrhythmia: Thought to be SVT, treated unsuccessfully with
adenosine; then thought to be Atrial fibrillation.  The patient
was admitted to the MICU on a diltiazem drip in sinus rhythm
with prolonged PR interval and frequent PVCs. Cardiology was
consulted. On further review of EKG from ED, patient likely had
an episode of atrial tachycardia.  To evaluate for source of
atrial tach, the patient underwent chest CTA that showed left
lower lobe consolidation and no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
She was started briefly on vancomycin and cefepime.  However,
she never developed clinical evidence of pneumonia and
antibiotics were stopped.  Electrolytes and TSH returned normal.
 ECHO showed moderate pulmonary hypertension, severe TR, 1+
aortic stenosis, 1+ MR.  The patient's home atenolol was
discontinued and she was started on metoprolol tartrate 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
for rate control.  The patient had a second episode of narrow
complex tachycardia on [**9-22**] up to the 200s which resolved after
IV metoprolol and diltiazem. It was not captured on EKG
therefore it was not possible to tell the underlying rhythm.
There was no clear trigger. She was subsequently transferred to
the floor [**9-23**] and on [**9-24**] had a third episode of 45 seconds of
asymptomatic SVT that spontaneously resolved. On tele, looked to
be A tach with unknown trigger. Patient's metoprolol was
uptitrated and she was discharged on
