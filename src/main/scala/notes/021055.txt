Chief Complaint:
hypotension/weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation twice
Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
86 y/o M with hx of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, HL, sCHF and COPD who
presents from [**Location (un) **] health via EMS with report of one hour
of generalized weakness and borderline hypotension. The weakness
began after working with PT today during which he describes his
exercise regimen was advanced. On questioning he does endorse
mild shortness of breath with exertion over the last few days.
At rehab today, his BP was slightly lower with systolics in the
90s and they thought he had crackles on exam. He was recently
admitted from [**Date range (1) 82276**] on [**Hospital1 1516**] for an NSTEMI. He had a cardiac
cath on [**2174-2-18**] showing diffuse disease, but nothing
intervenable. His heparin, integrillin and nitro gtts were
stopped and the pain eventually abated. His pain was felt to me
multifactorial: recent PNA mid-[**Month (only) 956**] at OSH, his thoracic
aortic aneurysm, and some element of angina. He had no ECG
changes during episodes of chest pain. He was also noted to have
mild hypoxia and was diuresed during this admission. Since his
discharge on [**2174-2-23**], he describes a few episodes of mild chest
pressure. Each episode was more mild than the chest pain he
presented with on his prior admission. The chest discomfort
lasts < 30 minutes and is not associated with any diaphoresis,
nausea, SOB, or lightheadedness. The episodes were not related
to increased activity.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.6, HR 112, BP 97/63, R 16
and 100% 6L NC. He was negative for orthostatic hypotension. CXR
was consistent with volume overload. Labs were notable for BNP
[**Numeric Identifier 26361**], Trop 0.09 (trending down from 0.17 on [**2174-2-18**]), Cr 1.5 (at
baseline) He received 40 mg IV lasix prior to being transferred
to the cardiology floor.
.
On review of systems, patient admits to weight gain in the last
few days (per record [**3-22**] lbs) and increased shortness of breath
with exertion but he is uncertain if this is due to
deconditioning or his heart failure. He describes mild increased
leg edema. He describes episodes of chest pressure every [**2-18**]
days and last for 30 minutes at a time. He admits to new onset
diarrhea that he attributes to his increased bowel regimen since
his recent discharge. He denies fevers, chills, increased sputum
production, black or bloody stools, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, lightheadedness, falls, or loss of consciousness.

Representative Imaging:
CXR [**2174-3-3**]
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, including
marked cardiomegaly and severely tortuous aorta, which remains
similar in appearance. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
or pneumothorax is seen. The examination is essentially
unchanged as compared to multiple priors, including [**2170-7-12**].
The patient is status post median sternotomy.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable
cardiomegaly and marked aortic tortuosity.
.
CTA Chest [**2174-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild interval increase in size of a 6.5 cm thoracic aneurysm
without evidence of rupture. No evidence of aortic dissection.
2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy new since [**2167**], concerning for
entities such as lymphoma.
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease. Massive cardiomegaly.
4. Bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
5. Liver perfusion abnormalities.
6. Left renal cyst.
7. Tracheal configuration suggestive of tracheomalacia.
.
RUQ Ultrasound [**2174-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount of perihepatic and right lower quadrant free
fluid.
2. Hyperechoic liver lesions likely representing hemangiomas.
3. Bilateral renal cysts.
4. Assessment for free air is very limited on ultrasound exam
and abdominal radiograph or CT is recommended for further
workup.
.
AP CXR [**2174-3-6**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in interstitial pulmonary
infiltrates
consistent with edema. No other significant change.
