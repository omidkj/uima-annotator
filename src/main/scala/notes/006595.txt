Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 yo male patient with recent admission
[**Date range (1) 28307**] with cardiac cath showing 3 VD.  He was admitted [**3-24**]
for completion of pre-op workup for CABG.
On [**2130-3-27**] he went to the OR for CABG x 4 with SVG to the LAD,
SVG to the RCA, SVG to the OM1, and SVG to the Ramus.  Please
see op note for full details.  He was transferred to the CSRU
for post-operative care and hemodynamic monitoring.
He was weened and extubated on POD one.
On POD two he experienced some bursts of atrial fibrillation
treated with beta-blockade and intravenous amiodarone.  He was
also started on IV heparin for anticoagulation.
On POD four he was noted to have a small amount of sternal
drainage with a stable sternum.  He was transferred to the
inpatient floor for ongoing care.  A PICC was placed for IV
antibiotics.
On POD five he continued with some sternal drainage that was
monitored closely.  Strict sternal precautions were initiated
and he was started on PO warfarin for anticoagulation with his
history of atrial fibrillation.
Mr. [**Known lastname 23672**] left foot was monitored closely throughout his stay
up until this point by the vascular surgery team.  The pain in
his toes was impeding his physical therapy with inability to
weight bear from pain.  The vascular surgery team also felt that
the toes were worsening and that popliteal bypass would be
needed sooner than initially thought.
The next several days were uneventful with ongoing sternal
drainage.  On POD ten, it was agreed that his left toes were
continuing to worsening and pre-op testing for probable vascular
surgery was initiated.  His warfarin was also discontinued with
initiation of heparin IV when INR down.
On POD 14 ([**2130-4-10**]) Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 20354**] to the operating room
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for a left femoral below the knee popliteal
bypass.  Please see op note for full details.  Post-op he went
to the CSRU for close post-op management and remained under the
care of the cardiac surgery team with close monitoring by the
vascular service.
On PODs 15/2 he was again transferred to the inpatient floor for
ongoing care.
At this point his sternal drainage had completely resolved and
his left leg was healing well.
The physical therapy team continued to see Mr. [**Known lastname **] throughout
his hospital stay and recommended rehabilitation placement for
safety and ongoing recovery.
On POD 18 his vanco was discontinued.
On POD 19 he will be transferred to rehab.
