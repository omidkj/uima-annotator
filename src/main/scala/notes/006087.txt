HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
white gentleman with multiple medical illnesses who was
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the date of
admission with respiratory failure.  He complained of
progressive shortness of breath over one week with cough,
fever, night sweats, and nausea.  He had lethargy as well.

It was a concern in the Emergency Room of the right lower
lobe pneumonia.  He has had several recent medical admissions
including course of rehabilitation at [**Hospital **] Hospital for
hypoxic respiratory failure.

His past medical history is extensive and includes HIV
infection, methadone maintenance, history of DVT/PE, chronic
pancreatitis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
chronic lung disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis C positive.
History of pneumonia with methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus and intubation, and obstructive-sleep
apnea.

His medications on admission included amiodarone 200 mg/day,
Epivir 25 mg/day, Protonix 40 mg/day, Megace 400 mg po q day,
MVI one po q day, Zoloft 50 mg po q day, Zerit 20 mg po q
day, Warfarin 2.5 mg po q day, methadone 50 mg po q day.  He
used Bactrim double strength one tablet 3x a week and
Roxicet, albuterol, zinc sulfate.

He had allergies to Thorazine and intolerant to H2 blockers
for thrombocytopenia.  Also did not tolerate due to rash
Haldol, clindamycin, Stelazine, and codeine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a chronically ill gentleman who lives
at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is unemployed and disabled.
Former heavy IVDU and tobacco user.

Family history includes pneumonia.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He complained of diffuse body pain,
shortness of breath, no chest pain, some cough.  No lower
extremity edema.  No travel or sick contacts.

His admission laboratory data included the following:  White
blood cell count 7.4, hematocrit 46.0, platelet count
209,000.  There was no left shift.  INR was 2.3, PTT 38.2.
Sodium 137, potassium 9.3, bicarbonate 21, chloride 104,
creatinine 8.1, BUN 65, glucose 121.  TSH was 4.0 in
[**Month (only) 956**].

His electrocardiogram showed a right axis deviation, sinus
rhythm with a rate of 100 with no ischemic type changes.

His x-ray showed upper lobe interstitial pattern and a right
lower lobe opacity.

His admission physical examination showed a blood pressure of
153/80, temperature of 99.6, heart rate 104, respiratory rate
26.  His oxygen saturation was 100% on 100% nonrebreather.
He was pleasant and interactive and appeared reasonably
comfortable.  His jugular venous pressure was elevated to the
jaw.  His oropharynx was clear.  His neck was supple without
lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or mass.  The lungs with
diffuse crackles, scant wheezes at the bases.  The heart had
a [**1-27**] murmur that was nonradiating, otherwise regular, rate,
and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft and nontender, normoactive bowel
sounds.  He had a palpable spleen.  No ascites.  Extremities:
There was no cyanosis or clubbing, there was trace ankle
edema, bilateral excoriations, and chronic venous stasis
changes.  He has a right subclavian hemodialysis catheter
that looked clean.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 108131**] was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for treatment of what was thought to be
hypercapnic respiratory failure.  There was also concern
about a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was treated with
BiPAP and remained hemodynamically stable.

He had a series of arterial blood gases which showed marked
acidosis with an initial pH of 7.06.  A subsequent arterial
blood gas showed pH of 7.14, pO2 of 49, pCO2 of 69 on 40%
oxygen.  He was treated with bicarbonate and Renagel, and
continued to be monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was
followed by the Renal Service and had dialysis.

The cause of his decompensation was unclear, initially
thought to be related to an aspiration event and then thought
to likely be primary metabolic process due to his muscle
weakness and inability to adequately ventilate.

He was transferred to the Medical Service on [**2179-3-24**], where
he continued to do well.  The Pulmonary Service completed a
consultation and recommended therapy with more aggressive
dialysis, bicarbonate repletion.  They felt his underlying
respiratory weakness was likely related to either myopathy or
simply debility on top of his underlying lung disease.

Nutrition service was also consulted.  He remained clinically
stable.  His antibiotics were discontinued as there was no
definite evidence of pneumonia.  The sputum culture was
thought to be colonized only.  There was an attempt to
arrange for placement, but this was ultimately not successful
as he thought not to be a good rehabilitation candidate.  He
was ultimately discharged to home with followup arranged with
his primary care physician and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] in the
Pulmonary Unit.
