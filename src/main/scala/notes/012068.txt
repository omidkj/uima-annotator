Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo Male presening with respiratory distress likely secondary
to pneumonia.
He was maintained on pressors, broad spectrum antibiotics and
fluids through a fem line.  Pt was also demonstrating renal
failure acute on chronic with a low urine output.  This was in
part thought due to dehydration which also caused his
hypernatremia.  the patient was resucitated with Normal Saline.

reached. ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31765**])  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 31766**] came in the
morning for a discussion.  We explained Mr. [**Known lastname 31767**] medical
condition.  Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] reported taht Mr. [**Known lastname **] never wanted
to be in this state (ie relieant on pressors with freq
hospitalizations).  The pt was made CMO and pressors were
stopped.  His BP slowly trended down over the afternoon.
