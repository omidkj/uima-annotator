Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-3-18**] - Triple lumen IJ line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69y/o lady with COPD, ulcerative colitis,
diverticulosis s/p partial colectomy, and 2 PE's in the past on
chronic Warfarin with IVC filter who presented to the ED for
chest pain and was found to have PEs and pneumonia.

Starting at 11PM last night, She intermittently has chest pain,
but this pain is worse since 11PM last over the past 2 hours.
It is left-sided, sharp, worse with coughing.  Not related to
cughing, not worse in any specific position.  She was at her
baseline level of shortness of breath.  Has chronic leg edema
but no worse than usual.  No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis.  Cough productive of yellow sputum and has been
ongoing for weeks, no acute change.  No change in recent
albuterol use.   Lightheaded when standing but otherwise no
lightheadedness, dizziness, recent falls or syncope.  She felt
that she probably had pneumonia or a PE so she came to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were: 8 99.4 92 93/55 18 96% 4L Nasal
Cannula.  She had coarse rhochi on the right and reduced air
movement bilaterally.  Labs were notable for WBC 11.6, INR 2.8.
CXR suggested PNA so she was given Vanc/Levo.  During the exam
patient becoming more confused and BP dropped to 80s/30s
remained low consistently.  2 large bore PIVs placed and she
received 3L NS with some improvement, but she again dropped her
SBP to the 70's.  A RIJ CVL was placed and NE was started due to
concern for septic shock.  Given her history of recurrent PE's
she underwent CTA which showed acute PE's in the segmental
anterior and posterior segments of the right superior lobar
artery, also LLL infiltrate.  She was not started on
anticoagulation because of a documented "Heparin and Lovenox
allergy" which was GI bleed in the setting of receiving Heparin
for her previous PE's when she has active colitis.  Given her
hypotension requiring pressors, she was admitted to the MICU.
VS prior to transfer were: HR 71, BP 132.63, RR 16, POx 96% 2L
(92% RA) on Levophed 0.08mg.kg.[**Known lastname **].

On arrival to the MICU, she is comfortable.  Still has [**6-16**]
chest discomfort and is asking for pain medications.  Her NE has
been shut off and her BP is stable.

[**2112-3-18**] CXR
Subtle opacity of the left lower lung abutting the left heart
border which may represent an early lingular pneumonia . Please
refer to
subsequent CTA chest for additional details.

[**2112-3-18**] CTA
1. Segmental pulmonary embolism in the right upper lobe.
2. Lingular and to a lesser extent left lower lobe pneumonia.

[**2112-3-18**] LENIs
No evidence of DVT. Limited assessment of the calf veins

[**2112-3-19**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Compared with the
prior report (images unavailable for review) of [**2107-1-3**], the
findings are similar.

[**2112-3-20**] CXR
The right internal jugular line has been discontinued. Heart
size and
mediastinum are unremarkable. Lungs are clear. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax demonstrated on the current
examination. The previously seen right middle lobe consolidation
appears to be improved since the prior study.  It might reflect
interval improvement of pulmonary infarct. Alternatively, it
could be less prominent due to different rotation of the
patient.
