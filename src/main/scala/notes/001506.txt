Chief Complaint:
Mild exertional dyspnea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-9-24**] s/p AVR (#21mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] epic)/Asc ao replacement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old female with
known aortic stenosis since [**2158**]. She has experienced a slight
increase in exertional dyspnea. She was recently assessed by an
exercise tolerance test and echocardiogram which revealed more
severe aortic stenosis. At times, the patient is aware of brief
flutters which occur at night without lightheadedness,
dizziness,
presyncope or syncope. She denies effort related chest pain. She
remains very active, and performs routine daily activities
without difficulty. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 116**] for
surgical discussion. She presents today for preadmission testing
for an aortic valve replacement with possible ascending aorta
replacement [**2162-9-20**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Pertinent Results:
Echocargiogram [**2162-9-24**]:
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is very small pericardial effusion.

Post-Bypass:
The patient is on a phenylephrine infusion s/p aortic vavle and
ascending aortic plication.
There is a well seated #21 bioprosthetic aortic valve. There are
no perivalvular leaks. Peak and mean gradients are 14/7 with a
cardiac output of 3.6.
Left ventricular function is preserved with estimated EF-55%
Mitral regurgitaion appears slightly worse (mild-mod MR).
Tricuspid Reguritaiton remains [**1-11**]+.
There is no echocardiographic evidence or aortic dissection
post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2162-9-24**] where
the patient underwent Aortic Valve(#21mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] epic
tissue)/Ascending Aortic replacement .  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. She arrived AP over SB and was hypertensive
required nitro gtt. She was initially hypoxic and required extra
vent support, she eventually extubated without difficulty. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from the Nitro.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight. She became hypoglycemic after receiving
Lantus per ICU protocol and remained in the unit one extra day
for monitoring.  She was hypotensive and beta blocker was
adjusted. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor on
POD#2 for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
