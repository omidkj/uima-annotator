Service: MED

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14037**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute R hemiparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
    The patient is an 83 yo M who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from
Provident NH on [**2166-6-26**], after being found partially out of bed,
likely after a fall. Scrapes were noted on his R arm, leg, and
abdomen.  The patient was noted to be drowsy, and he was unable
to move the R side of his body.  At baseline, the patient was
able to transfer from bed to chair, walk with a cane, and speak
fluently.  During the episode, his finger stick glucose was 381.
 He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible stroke
and management of hyperglycemia.
    In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable, but was
noted to have a WBC 15.1, glucose of 443, anion gap of 18, Cr of
1.5 (1.3 in [**4-22**]), and CK ~24,000.  CT head was negative for
bleed or mass. The patient was initially admitted to the Stroke
service.  After MRI/A showed no evidence of a stroke, the
patient was transferred to the MICU for further management of
DKA and rhabdomyolosis.
    In the MICU, the patient was aggressively hydrated for
treatment of DKA and rhabdomyolysis.  Given concern for infected
foot ulcers, he was started on Vanco/Unasyn.  He was followed
closely by Neurology. Etiology of R hemiparesis was thought to
be related to hyperglycemia, with concern that metabolic
derangements caused "reactivation" of old stroke. MRI did not
show evidence of an acute stroke.
    By [**6-28**], the patient was transitioned to SC insulin. CKs
have trended downward.  On [**6-29**], the patient was transfered to
the medical service.
