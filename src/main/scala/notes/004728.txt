History of Present Illness:
85 y/o M h/o CAD s/p CABG, dCHF, CRI, AFib on coumadin, CHB s/p
pacer, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] s/p tracheostomy for
management of respiratory failure and septic shock. According to
reports he was in St. [**Doctor Last Name **] with his wife where they live part
of the year when he suffered a fall.  Following that he had
progressive dyspnea.  He presented to the local hospital [**2151-6-29**]
where he had a chest xray that showed complete white out of the
left lung.  He was seen by the surgical consultant in the ED who
performed a thoracotomy and chest tube placement with a small
amount of red blood.  CT scan was reportedly suggestive of a
hemothorax.  His VS at that time were T 97 BP 85/49 WBC 5.2 Hgb
8.6 PLT 106 PTT 28.2 INR 1.49  Na 136 K4.2 AST 22 ALT 32 CKMB
1.6 Trop <0.05  ABG 7.5 pCO2 32.7 PO2 63, BUN 25 creat 2.4.
Chest CT from [**2151-7-1**] reportedly with complete opacification of
the left lung with air bronchograms.  Findings suggestive of
extensive pneumonic consolidation vs malignancy.   According to
physician notes felt most likely to be hemothorax [**1-30**] pneumonia
with supratheraputic INR of 4.4.
.
He was subsequently transferred to a hospital in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] on
[**2151-6-30**] for treatment by a pulmonologist.  He was treated with
levophed, imipenem/cilastin, vancomycin, Intropin?. He was
mechanically ventilated with settings CMV 50% 500 20 7.   During
his course he had bronchoscopy which showed LL atelctasis and
pneumonia.  He had an Echo [**2151-7-7**] which showed EF 60%, dilated
left atrium, mild MR, trivial TR, calcific aortic valve, severe
LV diastolic dysfunction, no pericardial effusion, no
intracardiac thrombus.  On [**2151-7-13**] he had tracheostomy given
severity of underlying lung process.  Levophed was weaned
starting on [**2151-7-13**].  CXR from [**2151-7-15**] reportedly showed
bilateral perihilar and basal opacities with obscuration of the
diaphragm and costophrenic angles most likely pleural effusion.
On [**2151-7-16**] he was transfused 10 units platelets.  Sputum CX from
[**7-13**] with [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans, urine culture from [**7-17**] with 10,000
[**Female First Name (un) **].  Blood culture [**7-14**] with no growth.  Labs on [**7-15**] with
Vanco T 29.6, [**7-17**] WBC 15.2 HCT 26.3 PLT 55, creatinine 1.4, BUN
85, Na 149, CL 129, CO2 19.
.
During his [**Hospital **] transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] his V/S were stable with
blood pressure 112/46 - 135/69, uneventful per report.

Physical Exam:
V/S T 97.5 HR 86 BP 94/45 RR 18 96% on AC 500/20/5/40% CVP 9
GEN: intubated, sedated
HEENT: PERRL, poor dentition; NGT
NECK: tracheostomy; R subclavian
CV: RRR nl S1S2 no m/r/g
PULM: asymmetric chest wall with sunken-appearing left
hemithorax; absent BS on left, coarse BS with scattered end-exp
wheeze on right
ABD: soft, NTND +BS
EXT: warm, dry; DP pulses + with doppler; extensive bandages
cover all 4 ext
SKIN: multiple areas of skin breakdown, friability, ecchymosis;
2 cm R lateral arm ulceration
NEURO: withdraws to painful stimuli


Pertinent Results:
CXR: near-complete white-out of left hemithorax with some
aeration of LUL field; RLL field with mild interstitial markings

.
EKG: V-paced HR 60, underlying rhythm is AFib; old TWI in I,L;
old J-point elevation in anterior precordial leads
.
TTE [**5-5**] - The left and right atria are markedly dilated. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Moderate diastolic dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o M h/o CAD s/p CABG, dCHF, CRI, AFib on coumadin, CHB s/p
pacer, CLL, s/p tracheostomy transferred for management of
respiratory failure and septic shock. On admission patient was
s/p tracheostomy.  The records incomplete but suspect hypoxic
resp failure in the setting of septic shock, airway collapse.  A
bronchoscopy revealed friable airways, bronchomalacia, mucous,
and old blood consistent with severe hemorrhagic aspiration PNA.
 Patient's repiratory status was supported with mechanical
ventilation.  A chest CT was performed which showed a loculated
pleural effusion concerning for emphyema. The patient's family
decided not to persue thoracocentesis to drain abscess.  The
patient septic shock did not improve after several days of
pressors and fluid boluses.  The patient was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics. Given the patient's poor overall prognosis
the family eventually decided to make the patient CMO.  He
passed away peacefully and his family was notified of the
patient's passing.
