Brief Hospital Course:
     83yo F initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] under the medical
service for presumtpive upper GI bleed.  She was transfused with
serial Hcts, received IVF resuscitation, and still required
ionotropic support.  GI and surgical consults was immediately
obtained; a cordis line was placed and she was electively
intubated.  An EGD found a large bleeding ulcer at the gastric
incisura which was injected and electrocautery applied; please
see EGD report for details.  A protonix drip was begun and the
hemodynamics initially improved with no new bleeding noted.
Serial Hcts however resumed downtrending the next morning.
After receiving since admission in 24 hours a total of 9units of
PRBCs, 5units of FFP with successful normalization of INR, 1unit
platelets and 1unit cryoprecipitate, she was therefore taken to
the OR for resection of the bleeding ulcer; please see operative
report for details.  A subtotal gastrectomy was performed on
[**9-2**] with a Billroth 2 anastamosis.
     POst-operatively, the patient was brought to the SICU in
intubated condition with stable hemodynamics.  Serial Hcts were
stable, pressor support was unnecessary, and she was easily
extubated.  She was begun on lopressor for atrial fibrillation
rate control and her home dose of digoxin.  The cordis was
changed to a triple-lumen and the femoral line removed.
     The patient was transferred to the floor on POD 2 and begun
on stage 1 post-gastrectomy diet with was tolerated and advanced
sequentially.  PT began to see the patient.  The Hct slowly
downtrended over the next two days with stable hemodynamics and
asymptomatic anemia, likely either dilutional from mobilizing
fluid or related to her pre-admission hemolytic anemia.  She was
seen earlier in the admission by Heme/Onc and was now transfused
2unit PRBCs with lasix.  Cardiology was consulted for fluid
management given her cardiac history.
     On POD 4 she developed respiratory distress and tachycardia
due to pulmonary edema; pulmonary embolus was ruled out with a
Chest CT angiogram.  Cardiology was re-consulted and she was
brought to the SICU for closer observation.  Aggressive diuresis
with lasix commenced and she improved without requiring
intubation.  An echocardiogram was performed showing worsening
mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension without wall
motion abnormalities.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.  A
diltiazem drip was begun for rate control and was later
transitioned to POs.
     After successful diuresis and rate control, she was
returned to the floor on POD 7.  Lasix was returned to her home
dose, good rate control with diltiazem and digoxin, and PT was
re-consulted to mobilize the patient.  Post-gastrectomy diet was
resumed and advanced and tolerated.  The mid-portion of the
wound began draining dark serosanguinous fluid and was opened,
cultured, and packed with wet-to-dry gauze; kefzol begun.
Erythema was minimal and resolved quickly, the wound base was
clean and non-purulent, and kefzol discontinued.  Her affect was
blunted but improved with family visits and better mobility from
PT.  Hypokalemia was repleted and checked, the central line was
removed and PIV placed, and coumadin begun.  Upon discharge she
was afebrile, tolerating a post-gastrectomy heart-healthy diet,
with stable hematocrit, controlled AFib, and a clean wound.
