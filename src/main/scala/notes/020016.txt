Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was intially evaluated in emergency room @ [**Location (un) **]
and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Her
hospitalization was prolonged and complicated, as outlined below
by systems.

Neuro: The patient was awake and alert upon admission. Her
mental status has since been variable given the multiple
interventions and prolonged hospitalization she has endured. Her
pain has been controlled with Tylenol and PRN IV narcotics. She
is able to follow commands, but remains weak and in need of
significant rehabilitation. She is unable to phonate given her
prolonged intubation and now tracheostomy. She is to progressed
to a Passe-Muir valve, however her respiratory failure limited
her ability to performed PMV trials.

Vascular: The patient was admitted on [**1-17**] with an acutely
bleeding L fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass ([**2124-11-29**]) and an infected L groin.
Her Hct was 18 at the time of presentation. Non-contrast CT
demonstrated air and fluid in the L groin wound. Bleeding was
initially controlled with pressure, however she later developed
decreased pulses in her LLE. Of note, the aortobifemoral bypass
([**2111**]) was not exposed during the most recent procedure. She was
taken to the OR for debridement of the L groin and thrombectomy
of L femoral-popliteal bypass. She was having an acute MI at the
time of surgery, and after Cardiology consultation, there was no
recommended intervention to improve her cardiac function. She
tolerated the procedure relatively well. Postoperatively she was
maintained on a heparin gtt. She was covered with broad spectrum
antibiotics for her infected groin/graft. Her groin was treated
initially with a VAC dressing.

On [**1-29**] the patient had another brisk epsiode of bleeding and
she was again taken emergently to the operating room. A
pseudoaneurysm was found at the proximal anastamosis and a
grossly infected graft was noted. She underwent removal of the
infected L fem-AK [**Doctor Last Name **] PTFE bpg, excision of pseudoaneurysm, and
saphenous vein patch profundaplasty. Over the following days,
her LLE became progressively more ischemic and she eventually
was brought back to the operating room on [**2-1**] for a L BKA given
her lack of revascularization options. Her excised graft grew
[**Female First Name (un) **] and she was maintained on Fluconazole for the remainder
of her hospitalization. Her BKA stump was opened laterally on
[**2-5**] for suspected infection and swab cultures were taken, which
eventually grew VRE. She was treated with a full course of
Linzeolid and wet to dry dressing changes were use to maintain
the opened portion of the stump.

Her Vascular exam remained stable for the remainder of her
hospitalization with dopplerable signals in her distal RLE. Her
L BKA stump has adequately closed and without signs of continued
infection. Multiple CT scans of the stump and L groin were
obtained for suspected infection. However, combined with the
lack of external signs of infection, the small fluid
collections/hematomas appeared stable and not infected.

Cardiac: On admission the patient was having a symptomatic
STEMI. Troponins peaked at 1.96. Cardiology was consulted and
determined that there was no further therapy to improve her
coronary status given she had previously undergone CABG and
subsequent coronary arteriography showing extensive disease
without reconstruction options. An ECHO was performed on [**1-18**],
which showed an LVEF of 50%. This was repeated later in the
course given her poor renal function and hypotension on [**1-/2046**],
which showed that overall left ventricular systolic function was
severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis of all segments except the basal inferior,
posterior, and lateral segments. This was thought to be due to
her recent MI and remodeling. She did require pressors
(intropes) multiple times to maintain her cardiac output. She
did not require pressors during the last 2 weeks of her
hospitalization. She was over-diuresed and did require some
volume resuscitation the week prior to transfer, but eventually
was hemodynamically stable with acceptable SBP in the 90-120
range. Her volume status was very difficult to assess and there
was an unsuccessful attempt at PA catheter placement. Her
troponins did trend down and did not spike again during her
course. Her last troponin was 0.12 on [**2-17**]. During the final
week, her blood pressure was increasingly difficult to maintain,
despite volume resuscitation. Sepsis and the resulting
inflammation made it essential impossible for her to maintain
adequate intravascular volume. Pressors were reinstitued on [**3-21**]
to maintain her blood pressure, but requirements gradually
increased without signs of improvement.

Pulmonary: The patient required multiple intubations during her
hospitalization. Initially this was mainly due to the multiple
procedures she underwent, however following her 2nd MI she had
significant difficult weaning from the ventilator. Given her
lack of progression in weaning from the ve
