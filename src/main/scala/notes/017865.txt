with diminished breath sounds. An ABG was 7.5/44/60/33 and she
was desated to 70s% on RA. Labs notable for hct of 30, WBC 11.6.
A CXR showed pulmonary edema with large R sided pleural
effusion. She got 80mg iv lasix, 120mg of dilt po and placed on
BIPAP briefly and transferred her to [**Hospital1 18**]. She was transferred
on NRB.

At [**Hospital1 18**], her VS were T97.3 HR90 BP99/49 RR24 95% NRB. She was
unable to be weaned off NRB, desating to 80s. She has put out
~600cc of urine. An ECG was notable for afib hr 98bpm, unchanged

exacerbation. She had a TTE on that admission that showed
[**Year (4 digits) 1192**] MS/MR/TR, severe pulm artery systolic hypertension, EF
65%. She was found to have a pleural effusion that was tapped
and showed transudative fluid, culture/cytology negative. She
was diuresed with lasix and her symptoms improved.
