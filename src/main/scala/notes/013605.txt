Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial effusion and tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old female with history notable for
breast ([**2111**]; s/p lumpectomy + XRT; ductal CA [**2132**]) and stage
IIIa T2N2 NCLC s/p RLL resection in [**2132-10-17**] and chemo
(cisplatin + taxol)/XRT in [**2132**].
.
Since [**2134-6-17**] she has had progressive dyspnea and has seen Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] to w/u this process. And has had a bronch [**8-/2134**]
negative for malignancy; + atypical cells suggestive of post-XRT
change however; Cx + for MAC (grew out after 1 month). She has
not undergone any therapy for this. This dyspnea was very slowly
progressive and did not require supplumental Oxygen.
.
2 weeks ago Ms [**Known lastname **] began having pleuritic chest pain and
resting chest pain worse with lying supine and leaning forward.
She also experienced worsening dyspnea and fatigue, night
sweats, cough productive of clear sputum, she denied fevers or
chills. She presented to an OSH where she was found to have a
pericardial effusion (no tamponade) and she was treated with
NSAIDS. Since this eccho her dyspnea has progressed despite 3
days of levoflox, to the point of being unable to walk so she
presented to the ED yesterday.
.
In the ED she was given flagyl to cover anaerobic infection and
bedside eccho did not appear changed. CTA chest showed potential
RUL infection vs lymphangitic dz and large pericardial effusion.
She was transferred to the floor where she was noted to be
dyspneic with RR 32 +accessory muscle use, but was satting well
on 4L n/c with ABG 7.41/43/306/22. VS at that time RR 32, 100%
3L, BP 127/74, P 105. A trigger was called and bedside eccho
showed large 3cm effusion with RV collapse and emergent bedside
pericardiocentesis was performed with 390 cc serosanguinous
fluid drained. Her dyspnea improved dramatically.
.
She currently feels much better; she endorses constipation, +
orthopnea, pain at site of drain. Also c/o thirst

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-1-16**] CHest CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Large pericardial effusion. Bilateral small pleural
effusions.
2. Right upper lobe parenchymal opacities and interstitial
thickening concerning for aspiration or infection. No recurrent
tumor evident.
3. No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
4. Right breast soft tissue nodule which should be correlated
with mammogram.
.
[**2135-1-17**] ECHO:
Conclusions:  prepericardiocentesis:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is  small. Left ventricular systolic function
is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right  ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve  leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a large pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with  blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse, consistent with
early cardiac tamponade.
.
postpericardiocentesis:
A small, echodense residual pericardial effusion is present.
There is no
evidence of cardiac tamponade.
.
[**2135-1-20**] CXR: Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion,
stable. Right perihilar mass longstanding. No change in caliber
of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. Left lung hyperinflated.
Stable left apical calcification.
.
[**2135-1-20**] ECHO: hyperdynamic EF 80%. Effusion smaller

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old female with extensive Onc history
as above who is admitted for progressive dyspnea and found to
have pericardial tamponade.

1. Pericardial effusion - The differential diagnosis for her
pericardial effusion included viral infection (EBV, coxackie,
adenovirus) but given patient's history there is also
possibility malignant effusion (breast or lung) or radiation
induced pericarditis. Given h/o TB and + MAC on culture it is
also possible that the patient could have mycobacterial
pericarditis.  Cytology did not show malignant cells in the
pericardial fluid.  Stains are still pending for AFB and viral
serologies show no EBV.  Her effusion was noted to be decreasing
on subsequent ECHOs, pulsus not elevated.
.
2. Dyspnea - Her dyspnea on admission was most likely secondary
to pericardial tamponade and pulmonary parenchmal etiology.  She
also had MAC in a sputum culture from [**2134**] which is being
followed as an outpatient. Her dyspnea improved greatly once the
pericardial effusion was drained.  She was treated with azithro
and cefpodoxime for the MAC (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]- outpatient  pulm)
and new infiltrate on CXR for 7 days and is to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient. She was also sent home with home
oxygen and nebulizer machine to help with her dyspnea.
.
3. Diarrhea: C diff high on differential, although post abx
diarrhea also possible. C diff x3 was negative, other cultures
also negative. She was given pepto bis for symptom relief with
good effect. She had low grade fevers, but her WBC has been
trending down during the admission. Possibly [**2-18**] drug effect or
viral gastroenterology.
.
4. A fib/flutter with RVR: to 140's and ventricular
trigeminy-always hemodynamically stable. This was likely
secondary to irritation of pericardial catheter initially. She
was rate con
