Admission Date:  [**2192-1-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2192-1-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2128-8-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU/Medicine [**Hospital1 **] Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old
female with a past medical history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (status post Medical Intensive Care Unit
admission and intubation - discharged on [**2192-1-2**])
who was readmitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on
[**1-13**] with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The patient called Emergency Medical Service on the day of
admission secondary to complaints of shortness of breath and
decreased mental status.  She was subsequent intubated in the
field.

On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient was
bradycardic and progressed to pulseless electrical activity.
She received atropine, epinephrine, and transcutaneous
pacing.  She subsequently resumed a pulsed and became
tachycardic to the 190s.  The patient received a
cardioversion with a subsequent heart rate of 110 to 120;
although, she was not noted to be hypotensive while
tachycardic.

An echocardiogram was performed at the bedside and revealed
no effusions or evidence of right heart strain.  The patient
was started on levofloxacin on [**1-15**] secondary to
yellow sputum as well as concern for aspiration pneumonia in
the setting of her field intubation.  The patient was
extubated on [**2192-1-15**].

Of note, the patient was recently discharged after intubation
and Medical Intensive Care Unit course on [**2192-1-2**].
She was sent home on a slow prednisone taper; however, she
continued to actively smoke at home.  Upon questioning, the
patient was unsure of prior prednisone taper dose or if she
was even taking the steroids that were prescribed.

At the time of transfer to the floor the patient reported her
breathing was better than baseline and denied any fevers,
chills, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or a
change in bowel or bladder habits, diarrhea, or constipation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FEV1 equals 0.46
(26% of predicted), FVC equals 1.28, FEV1:FVC ratio equals
49%.  The patient is on 2 liters nasal cannula at home.
2.  Diastolic congestive heart failure (with left ventricular
ejection fraction of greater than 55% and no wall motion
abnormalities)
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Ethanol; history of withdrawal.
5.  Right pneumothorax in [**2190-1-29**] (status post bleb
resection and pleurodesis).
6.  Status post total hip replacement bilaterally.
7.  Positive tobacco history.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Home medications included)
1.  Prednisone taper.
2.  Thiamine.
3.  Folate.
4.  Multivitamin.
5.  Diltiazem 120 mg by mouth three times per day.

The patient is unsure which inhaler she is currently using.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature current was
97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, temperature maximum was 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 97, her blood pressure was
131/52, her respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen
saturation was 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general,
the patient was cantankerous, comfortable, and in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the oropharynx was clear.  The mucous membranes were
dry.  Neck revealed the patient with internal jugular triple
lumen in place.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
respiratory rate.  No murmurs.  Lungs had decreased breath
sounds throughout.  There was a prolonged expiratory phase.
No wheezes.  The abdominal examination revealed there were
positive bowel sounds.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed no edema.
Neurologic examination revealed the patient was alert and
oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell
count was 6.1, her hematocrit was 31.3, and her platelets
were 169.  Chemistry-7 revealed her sodium was 140, potassium
was 3.6, chloride was 95, bicarbonate was 37, blood urea
nitrogen was 38, creatinine was 1.2, and her blood glucose
was 125.  Arterial blood gas was 216/7.2/42/59/58.  Arterial
blood gas on admission was 7.26/75/455 (on AC 550/12/5/0.9).
Urine culture on [**1-13**] revealed no growth.  Blood
culture on [**1-13**] revealed [**12-4**] coagulase-negative
Staphylococcus.  Sputum culture on [**1-14**] revealed Gram
stain with 1+ oropharyngeal flora.  Culture revealed sparse
oropharyngeal flora.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on [**1-15**]
revealed massive collapse and consolidation of left lower
lobe.  A healing fracture of right sixth and seventh ribs
posteriorly.

Lower extremity Doppler studies on [**1-14**] revealed no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient is a 63-year-old female with severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease including multiple recent
intubations admitted with yet another chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation/hypercarbic respiratory
failure in the setting of noncompliance with prior steroid
taper regimen and continued tobacco use.

1.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE ISSUES:  The
patient was extubated on [**1-15**].  Currently feeling
better than her baseline at home.  She remained on albuterol
and Atrovent inhalers.  The patient needs a slow prednisone
taper over several weeks.  Goal peripheral oxygen saturations
of 90% to 92% (she is on 2 liters nasal cannula at home at
baseline).  Continue nicotine patch and smoking cessation.

2.  RIGHT LOWER LOBE COLLAPSE VERSUS CONSOLIDATION ISSUES:
The patient is on a course of levofloxacin for seven days.
Continue on incentive spirometry and pulmonary toilet.

3.  CHEST PAIN ISSUES:  The patient was complaining of
reproducible chest pain.  She had negative cardiac enzymes,

etiology of heme-positive emesis.  The patient had no further
episodes of emesis throughout her stay.  The patient is
currently on a proton pump inhibitor every day dosing.
