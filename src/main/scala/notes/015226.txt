Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
55F with metastatic breast cancer to bone on palliative
gemcitabine now Cycle 3 Day 24 who presented the ED with acute
chest pain and shortness of breath.  Patient states that she was
pale this morning and started feeling weak. She took a nap and
awoke with pain with breathing.  She describes a feeling of
panic about her breathing, like she couldn't get air in.  She
has never experienced this exact sensation before.  Her
temperature was 101.7 one hour after she had taken Tylenol.  She
has a non-productive cough.
.
In the ED, vitals 100.8 135/59 103 38 90%RA.  Responded well to
2L supplemental oxygen.  She received 1L NS and 750mg Levaquin
IV.  For her pain, she received her long-acting, oxycontin.
Chest x-ray was negative for acute process and the preliminary
read of the CT scan did not show evidence of a pulmonary
embolism.  EKG unchanged from baseline.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient states that her symptoms are
much better.  She is now pain free and feels that she is
breathing more comfortably with the help of the oxygen.
Detailed ROS negative except for minor hemorrhoidal bleeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU COURSE

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 55 year old woman with metastatic breast
cancer s/p Gemcitabine who presents with fevers, headaches,
shortness of breath and chest pain
.
A/P: 55yo F with  Hx of metastatic breast CA currently on
plliative gemcitabine transferred from the floor with worsening
hypoxemia.
.
# Hypoxemia: She initially presented with shortness of breath.
She was admitted to the oncology service.  Initial CTA was
negative for PE and cardiac enzymes were negative for ACS.   SHe
began to worsen clinically on the floor with development of
ground glass opacities on CXR and drop in her sats to 70% on RA.
She had coverage for PNA broadened to vanco, cefepime, and
azithro, as well as Bactrim for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 151**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 13874**] added for her
history of coccidiomycosis.  ID and pulmonary were both
consulted. She had a bronchoscopy with BAL performed which was
negative for organisms.  Respiratory viral screen and culture
negative as well.  Her pCO2 continued to increase with sats
still only 90% on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] decision was made on HD 3 ICU day 1 to
to electively intubate.  She required high doses of sedation,
SBP was high 80s-90s, so decided to put in CVL in anticipation
of possible need for pressors.  Her BP improved with fluid
boluses.  She was also started on Methylprednisolone 60 mg qday
for empiriic treatment of gencitabine pneumonitis given the
ground glass appearance on CT with lack of other systemic
symptoms of infection.  Continued on the ventilator, switching
to Precedex for sedation on ICU day #3 as Fentanyl/Versed
combination was not adequate.  Pt. was gradually weaned and
extubated from the ventilator by ICU day 4.  Continued on
methylprednisolone.  Antibitoic regimen was adjusted, with
cessation of vancomycin and Bactrim based on worsening renal
function (see below)and continuation of Cefepime and
Azithromicin. After transfer from the ICU, her hypoxemia
continued to improve and she was able to weaned to 2L O2 by
nasal cannula to keep her sats > 90% with exertion. Her
antibiotics were changed to Cepodoxime with continuation of her
azithromycin 2 days prior to discharge without worsening in her
pulmonary status (4 days remaining in her antibiotic course at
DC). She was switched to po prednisone and will continue
steroids with a taper as an outpatient for the question of
gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity. After transfer out of the ICU,
her functional status rapidly improved and she was able to
ambulate with minimal assistance or a walker by the time of
discharge.
.
#  Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr of about 0.6.  By HD4/ICU
1, creatinine had increased to 1.6.  UOP was tenous with 20-40
cc's an hour in the face of multiple fluid boluses.  Several
possible etiologies, including contrast induced nephropathy
given prior imaging.  Had urinalysis which showed granular casts
s/o ATN.   Medication induced ARF possible as well. Had renal US
which was negative for structural disease.  Continued to renally
dose meds.  Renal consult performed and aided in guiding
treatment.  Cr. peaked at 2.1, with levels at 1.8 at time of
discharge from the ICU. Her Cre rapidly returned to [**Location 213**] and
was 0.8 on the day of discharge.
.
# New urinary and fecal incontinence: On the day of discharge
the patient reported new urinary and fecal incontinence. On
physical exam she had a nonfocal neurological exam with normal
rectal tone but point tenderness over her mid to low thoracic
spine. Given her known spinal metastases, an MRI of T and L
spine was obtained prior to her discharge. Preliminary report
was without evidence of cord compression, but did note new
pleural effusions left greater than right.
.
# New pleural effusions: Although the patient's pulmonary status
continued to improve after her transfer from the ICU to the
hospital floor, she was found to have assymptomatic new pleural
effusions on an MRI obtained to
