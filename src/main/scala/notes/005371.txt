Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, hypothermia, mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25925**] is a 56-year-old male with progressive MS who has had
multiple admissions in last year for ?sepsis, pneumonia and UTI
(has had suprapubic catheter in place since [**1-25**]) who presented
on [**2140-11-2**] with questionable mental status changes, hypothermia
and hypotension in setting of overnarcotization.
.
Per wife, had [**Name2 (NI) 15618**] baclofen pump 6 days prior to
admission, then downtitrated again 4 days prior to admission,
after which patient appeared somewhat sleepy, but without acute
changes. One night prior to admission, wife reportedly took a
fentanyl patch off of patient and placed a new one.  On the day
of admission, SBP at home was initially in the 130s, but then
after bathing and numerous activities with home health aide
became hypotensive to 80s.  EMS was activated and patient was
brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital for further evaluation.  Per wife,
no fever, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, or vomiting
occurred (PCP notes that wife has noted the patient
intermittently hypotensive at home, but no log brought in here.
Per patient, wife checks his blood pressure at home three times
each day).
.
After being brought to [**Location (un) **], patient continued to remain with
SBP in 80s w/ drop as low as to 50s. He responded to 4 liters
NS, and was given levofloxacin 500mg once.  Two fentanyl patches
were found on his body - the first at the outside hospital, and
then a second patch removed upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] per patient and family
secondary to wanting care here. In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, CT of head was
negative for intracranial bleed. He received 3 more liters  of
normal saline, as well as vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
clindamycin.  Pt rewarmed passively to over 35 (family reports
pt typically 91-[**Age over 90 **]F). In addition, was given narcan with
apparent good effect on blood pressure.  Blood cultures and
urine cultures were drawn.
.
He was transferred to the CCU on [**2140-11-2**].  CXR showed diffuse
worsening pulmonary edema and an opacity in the left lung base
that could be confluent edema or an early focus of infection.
Patient was started on vancomycin because of concern for MRSA.
.
Patient was transferred from CCU in hemodynamically stable
condition to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 on [**2140-11-3**].  Upon transfer, patient was
experiencing sharp pain in his lower extremities bilaterally
from his hips to his toes, "the usual pain".  He was unable to
move his lower extremities or his hands, but claims that this
too is normal (from MS).  He denied trouble breathing, abdominal
pain, headache, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
or palpitations.

Past Medical History:
1) Progressive multiple sclerosis (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 25923**] [**Name (STitle) 25924**])

Per patient, diagnosed with MS in [**2119**].  Went on disability in
the end of [**2127**].  Wheelchair-bound.  Symptoms are worse in warm
temperatures, so he tries to keep his room as cool as possible.
.
2) Multiple admissions for hypothermia and ?sepsis
.
3) h/o upper GIB (ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis secondary
to NSAIDS)
.
4) h/o LGIB (Colonoscopy in [**9-26**] revealed internal hemorrhoids
and polyp)
.
5) History of pneumonia
Most recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2140-10-19**] with a final
diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia
.
6) Neurogenic bladder
S/p placement of suprapubic catheter.  Managed with oxybutynin
(antispasmodic [**Doctor Last Name 360**]) 5mg PO qday.  Multiple UTIs, last one
[**2140-10-17**] with enterobacter and proteus susceptible to meropenem
and ciprofloxacin.
.
8) GERD
Likely secondary to ulcerative esophagitis and gastritis
secondary to NSAIDS
.
9) Hypertension
.
10) CHF (EF >65% [**2140-10-3**])
.
11) Left eye blindness

Social History:
He is married 32 years and lives with his wife at home.  He has
three children and three grandchildren. He was a professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 25931**] engineering at [**University/College 25932**], but
retired on disability after the [**2128**] spring semester due to his
MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is wheelchair-bound.  He denies tobacco, alcohol, and
recreational drug use.


Family History:
Father had CAD and CVA. Mother has [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease. Brother
has diabetes.

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) [**2140-11-2**]
Diffuse worsening pulmonary edema. The opacity in the left lung
base may be confluent edema although a focus for early infection
cannot be excluded. Repeat radiography following appropriate
diuresis is recommended to assess for underlying infection.
.
HEAD CT [**2140-11-2**]:
Comparison is made with a prior head CT dated [**2140-10-19**].
The evaluation is somewhat limited due to patient motion.  There
is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no mass
effect.  No shift of normally midline structure is noted.  Note
is made of mucosal thickening in ethmoid sinus.  The osseous
structure is unremarkable. Impression: Somewhat limited stud
