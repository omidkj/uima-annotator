Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peritoneal dialysis catheter revision


History of Present Illness:
47M h/o ESRD on PD, HTN, diastolic CHF p/w respiratory distress
after elective PD catheter revision.  Pt had low flow via PD
catheter during last few days prior to admit and therefore went
to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheter revision.  Procedure completed without
complications, but pt developed respiratory distress after
extubation.  Pre-OP VS T 98.4, HR63, RR18, BP 146/67, 98%RA; was
found to be breathing slowly post-op as anaesthesia had not been
fully reversed. Additionally, BP increased transiently to
190/90; O2sat 89% on RA.  BiPAP 5/8 was placed with rapid
increase in O2sats to 100%.  Received nebs given wheeze on
clinical exam.  Pt received only 350cc IVF during procedure,
furosemide 20mg IV was given post-procedure and 150cc UOP were
recorded.  CXR showed mild flash pulmonary edema.
.
MICU evaluation requested due to respiratory distress. On
evaluation, VS were stable with normalized BP, O2 sats 100% on
BiPAP.  Renal attg also consulted by surgery team and overnight
monitoring in MICU was requested with possible peritoneal
dialysis.  Furosemide 200 mg IV administered per renal recs and
pt was transferred to MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
47M h/o ESRD on PD, HTN, diastolic CHF p/w respiratory distress
after elective PD catheter revision.
.
# Respiratory distress: Pt initially admitted for peritoneal
catheter revision, but BP to 190/90 after extubation
post-procedure with acute SOB and desat to 80s.  Administered
BiPAP and furosemide 200mg IV with MICU transfer.  CXR showed
likely pulmonary vascular congestion in setting of known
diastolic heart failure.  Peritoneal dialysis was started
overnight given limited response to furosemide IV, but
suboptimal PD as pt was recently post-op.  Weaned off BiPAP upon
MICU arrival, and trial off O2 in a.m. revealed 93% O2sats on RA
at rest.  Chlorothiazide 500 mg IV subsequently administered,
followed by furosemide 200mg IV.  Ambulatory O2sat later 93-97%
with no SOB.  Pt d/c'd on furosemide 200mg PO BID with
instructions to f/u in renal clinic the next day.
.
# ESRD/PD revision: Pt producing urine, PD catheter operating.
Pt continued on calcitriol, PhosLo, per home regimen; d/c'd on
Kayexalate 15mg daily with instructions to f/u in renal clinic
the next day.  Also issued script for oxycodone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] PRN pain
x 2 days.
.
# Hyperkalemia [**1-25**] ESRD: K = 5.7 in PACU with EKG demonstrating
only minimal peaked T waves in V2, V3; pt on standing Kayexelate
as outpatient.  D/c'd with Kayexelate 15mg daily.  ACE-I and
amiloride held to avoid exacerbating hyperkalemia.
.
# Sinus bradycardia: Pt transiently bradycardic, resolved during
MICU admission.  Pt continued on home regimen of beta blocker
with holding parameters.
.
# HTN:  Brief episode of hypertension to 190/90 after extubation
likely contributing to respiratory distress.  Normotensive on
MICU evaluation and discharge.  Pt continued on home regimen of
beta blocker and Ca channel blocker, with ACE-I held given
hyperkalemia.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
1) Peritoneal catheter revision
2) Respiratory distress likely secondary to pulmonary edema
3) End stage renal disease
.
Secondary:
4) Hypertension
5) Diastolic heart failure


Discharge Condition:
Ambulatory oxygen saturation 93-97%


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital to readjust your peritoneal
catheter.  After the surgery, you had a high blood pressure
which caused you to become short of breath due to excess fluid
in your lungs.  At first you were treated with a special mask to
help with your breathing, but then this was stopped and you
received supplemental oxygen.
.
When you leave the hospital you will need to take some
additional mediations:
1) Lasix 200mg by mouth twice daily
2) Kayexalate 15grams daily (to help control your potassium
level)
.
***You should not take your lisinopril until you talk to your
kidney doctor.***
.
Also, you must follow-up in renal clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7473**] or
the available physician tomorrow, [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**] [**11-15**].
