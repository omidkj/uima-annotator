Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Plavix

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental Status Changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper Endoscopy, Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 81M w/ h/o CAD s/p 3V CABG, multiple PCI to bypass
grafts, AS, CHF w/ EF 35%, AICD, Afib s/p ablation, CRI recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbation who presented to an
OSH for mental status changes. Per his wife, since his discharge
he has been extremely weak, to the point where he has fallen to
the floor and required assistance to get back up. Twice the fire
department had to come to help with this. She has since hired a
male nursing aide to watch him while she is at work. He has been
intermittently irritable at home and more tired than usual,
having trouble sometimes staying awake during conversations. The
evening before admission he was agitated, repeatedly demanding
his wife get him scissors to cut off his pants that he felt were
constricting him. She took off his pants and tried to calm him
down enough to go to bed. She was awakened by police officers in
her house, as her husband had apparently called 911 saying
someone was trying to kill him. He was found with a large amount
of blood on the floor, apparently from a laceration on his left
foot. His wife later found an [**Name (NI) 95689**] knife by the bed. He was
brought to [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital where he denied CP and SOB. He was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he has gotten much of
his medical care.

Brief Hospital Course:
81M w/ h/o CAD, AS, CHF w/ EF 35%, AICD, Afib s/p ablation, CRI
recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbation who presents
with mental status changes

* Mental Status changes  - the differential diagnosis of this
included hypothyroidism, medications (rozerem, seroquel
possible), infection, worsening aortic stenosis, baseline
dementia.  Endocrine consulted and felt that coadministration of
thyroid hormone with iron/calcium replacement likely limiting
absorption; switched timing of med administration and increased
dose of thyroxine as per endocrine recs.  Indeed, TSH was as
elevated as 52.  Pt required two days of 300mcg levothyroxine
challenge as there initially seemed to be no change in FT4 or
Total T4 levels.

However, pt was ultimately noted to have steadily increasing
total T4 levels and was changed to a high dose of levothyroxine
175mcg.  Target levels are T4 >6 and FT>1.0

In addition, mental status altering meds were also discontinued.
 Pt mental status improved and had fewer episodes of
sun-downing.  Culture data unrevealing for infection.  Checked
B12, folate, RPR - all unrevealing for reversible causes.

In summary, given chronic nature of poor mental status and
difficulty with memory, it was felt that pt likely had chronic
progressive dementia with an element of psychosis further
exacerbated by delirium in the setting of hypothyroidism as well
as sundowning.

On discharge, his mental status was much improved and he was
significantly less delirious in the evenings.

* CHF - Initially treated with home PO lasix dose and
intermittent IV doses; pt. did well with weight at 81 kg.  On
presentation had no orthopnea but had low O2 requirement (2 L).
Ultimately was transitioned to a daily dose of PO Bumetanide
with good effect.  Per attending, pt was intermittently
transfused with packed red cells and required 40mg IV lasix to
remain euvolemic.

It should be noted, however, that pt did have fairly severe
abdominal distention which was thought to be due to ascites and
bowel edema as a result of right sided failure.  This was felt
in part to be worsened by hypothyroidism.

He was discharged on his home dose of 40 lasix PO bid; this
regimen should be addressed with him as an outpatient.

* Inguinal Hernia - Midway into the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course,
he was noted to have a large right inguinal hernia as well as a
scrotal hematoma.  As this was exquisitely tender, a stat u/s
was performed which revealed herniation of bowel, ascitic fluid,
but no torsion or limitation of vascular flow.  General surgery
consultants recommended no reduction at this time as 1) pt was
poor sgy candidate and 2) it was unclear how long the hernia had
been in place although it did not appear incarcerated as the pt
had no obstructive symptoms.  It was felt that the hernia could
probably be safely reduced once ascitic fluid pressure and edema
improved with resolving heart failure.  Lactic acid was not
elevated.

* Severe aortic stenosis - Pt has undergone multiple
valvuloplasties
