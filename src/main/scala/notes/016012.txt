Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old white male
patient who is admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**5-22**] with
an upper gastrointestinal bleed.  Endoscopy at that time
revealed duodenal ulcer which was injected with epinephrine
and he also had two AVM's which were cauterized.  H. Pylori
at that time was reportedly positive.  While he was being
treated at [**Hospital **] Hospital in the Intensive Care Unit, he
experienced some vague abdominal pain which radiated to his
chest and his neck and ultimately was found to have suffered
an anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  Cardiac
catheterization revealed a tight left main stenosis as well
as three vessel coronary artery disease and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2111-5-28**] for coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, status post
remote myocardial infarction by electrocardiogram, positive
claudication, peripheral vascular disease, gastroesophageal
reflux disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
syncope, history of prostate cancer, status post radiation
treatments.  He is a two pack a day smoker and question of a
left carotid artery stenosis.  The patient is widowed,
retired and lives alone.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Losartan 50 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Tiazac 300 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.


LABORATORY DATA:  Upon admission to the hospital were
unremarkable as baseline serum creatinine was 1.3.  He had a
peak CPK of 454 as well as a peak troponin of 16.6.  The
patient was admitted with EKG ST elevations in anterior
leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Cardiology Service
and underwent a carotid artery ultrasound on [**2111-5-29**],
which revealed no evidence of  carotid artery stenosis on the
right or left and he also had his groin viewed by ultrasound
which revealed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula on
either groin.  Gastroenterology Medicine consultation was
obtained at that time and it was their recommendation to do a
repeat upper gastrointestinal endoscopy prior to coronary
artery bypass graft.

The patient also had a Pulmonary Medicine consultation on [**2111-5-29**], due to a longstanding diagnosis of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  Their recommendation was for
the patient to have pulmonary function test with
bronchodilators as well.

The patient did not undergo an upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy because of his tenuous cardiac status and no
evidence of rebleeding.  His pulmonary function tests
revealed likely early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
but normal spirometry and volumes were measured at that time.
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**2111-6-2**],
where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times 3 with
a LIMA to the LAD, saphenous vein to the OM and saphenous
vein to the PDA by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].

Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in good
condition on IV Propofol drip.  He was weaned from mechanical
ventilator and extubated the night of surgery.  On
postoperative day 1, he remained on an insulin drip and was
continued to be followed by GI Medicine Service who
ultimately signed off with their recommendations for H.
Pylori treatment.  The patient was begun with cardiac
rehabilitation and physical therapy.

Over the next couple of days, he was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor on postoperative
day 1.  The patient continued to progress from a cardiac
rehabilitation and mobility stand point.  He had remained
hemodynamically stable and was weaning down oxygen support
and progressing well with pulmonary toilet and on
postoperative day 4, the patient went into rapid atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular response in the 140's to
150's.  He was treated with beta-blockers and amiodarone.  An
Electrophysiology consult was obtained at that time and it
was their recommendation to continue with the beta-blockers
and amiodarone as well as to replace electrolytes.  The
patient then was noted to have a small amount of serous
sternal drainage at the distal pole of his wound over the
next two days or so, but this subsided without any
intervention.  The patient remained in the hospital for the
next few days due to a rising creatinine.  His Lasix was
discontinued as his creatinine was noted to rise.  It peaked
at 1.8 on [**2111-6-10**] and has come down to 1.7 today on [**2111-6-11**].  He is ready to be discharged home today with
visiting nurses to monitor his wound as well as vital signs.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is afebrile.  He is in
sinus rhythm with a rate of about 60 to 65 per minute.  His
blood pressure is 96/49 this morning.  His Lopressor had been
decreased from 50 mg b.i.d. to 25 mg b.i.d. upon discharge
and his amiodarone had also been decreased from 200 three
times a day to 200 mg twice a day due to some bradycardia
over the past couple of days with a low rate of about 50.  He
is presently at a rate of 60.  Neurologically, the patient is
grossly intact. Pulmonary exam reveals the lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His coronary exam is regular rate
and rhythm. His abdomen is benign and his incisions are
clean, dry and intact.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Percocet 5/325 one p.o. q. 6 hours p.r.n. pain.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d. until [**6-17**] and then
   decrease to q.day.
5. Clarithromycin 500 mg p.o. q. 12 hours times 6 more days.
6. Amoxicillin 1 gram p.o. q. 12 hours times 6 more days.
7. Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9. Amiodarone 200 mg po. b.i.d times one month. This was at
   the recommendation of the Electrophysiology service at the
   time he went into atrial fibrillation or this can be
   modified at the discretion of the patient's primary
   cardiologist, Dr, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

The patient is discharged home. He is to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] at Cardiac Surgery in six week.  He is also to
follow up with the patient's primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in approximately two weeks as well as his primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1355**] in two weeks as well.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
   bypass graft.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4. Postoperative atrial fibrillation.
5. Positive H. pylori.


DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.
