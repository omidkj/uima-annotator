Pertinent Results:
Echo [**6-13**]: PRE-BYPASS: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. POST-CPB: Graft in position in the
ascending aorta. No leak. Small pericardial effusion. No leak or
dissection distally to the level of the abdominal aorta. AI
remains trace. Normal biventricular systolic function.
CXR [**6-16**]: Comparison is made to prior study of [**2101-6-14**]. The
heart size is unchanged as is the configuration of the
mediastinum. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The right lung
is clear. There is a small left pleural effusion and opacities
in the left lower lobe likely due to atelectasis. This also
appears stable.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17122**] had pre-operative work-up done as an outpatient and
was electively admitted on [**2101-6-13**] for surgery. She was brought
directly to the operating room where she underwent an ascending
aorta replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CSRU in stable condition for invasive
monitoring. Later on op day she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and then extubated. On post-op day two her
chest tubes were removed and she was started on beta blockers
and diuretics. She was gently diuresed throughout her post-op
course towards her pre-op weight. She was also transferred to
the cardiac surgery step-down floor on this day. Physical
therapy followed patient during post-op course for strength and
mobility. Epicardial pacing wires were removed. Over the next
several days she continued to improve quite well. Labs were
stable, anemic, but she was asymptomatic. Iron and Vit. c were
started. VS and physical exam were unremarkable and she was
discharged on post-op day four with VNA services and the
appropriate follow-up appointments.
