he was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  He is nonverbal at baseline, deaf,

is very unclear on the details regarding his admissions and
regarding the circumstances requiring him to be sent to the ED
this morning.  She reports he has had decreased PO and thinks he
had a syncopal event yesterday, but is again unclear of the
details.
.
He was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] for melena on [**2179-1-17**], received
an EGD showing a 1 cm bleeding gastric ulcer which was clipped
and other nonbleeding ulcers.  H. Pylori serology was positive,
but not bx of the ulcer was done at that time.  He require 3U
pRBCs during that admission.  He may have also had a [**Hospital1 756**]
admission in between for renal failure.

A CXR concerning for pna.  He was given vanc/cefepime/levo for ?
pna vs urine source.  Lactate elevated and remained elevated
despite 3 L of fluid.  His pressures were fluid responsive with
systolics up to 120.   He was satting well on RA, but he was put
on a facemask for comfort.  He was guaiac negative from below
and his belly was described as benign.  A bedside ultrasound
showed no free air.  Labs were notable for lactate 6.6, 6.9
after fluid.  Bicarb 24 with AG 17.  WBC 12.1, 12 Bands, Cr 4.3

slight elevation of AST but o/w LFTs wnl. BCx and UCx were sent
and a RIJ was placed.
.
Vitals prior to transfer were:
98  101/63  22  100% RA.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, history is limited because of the
