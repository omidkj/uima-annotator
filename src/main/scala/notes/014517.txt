Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS and agitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2184-4-30**] - Lumbar puncture
[**2184-4-30**] - G-J tube repositioning

History of Present Illness:
71 yo M with Pt with hx of HTN, HL, OSA, s/p unrestrained MVC
rollover on [**2184-3-9**] with TBI, L open ankle fracture, R closed
ankle fracture and dislocation, scalp laceration discharged with
hospital course complicated prolonged intubation, peri-operative
PEA arrest and apnea post-op requiring tracheostomy placement on
[**2184-3-18**]. He was discharged to rehab on [**4-2**] on trach collar, and
was readmitted from [**Date range (1) 110410**] with fever and AMS. His infectious
source during the last admission was felt to be related to his
deep left leg wound, and he subsequently underwent BKA on [**4-6**]
and revision on [**4-8**]. He also completed a course of vanco/zosyn
during that admission.
Per [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 8957**], MA ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 79922**]), he was
initially A&Ox1 when he arrived on [**4-21**]. Over the past 2 days
prior to admission, he had become more agitated and aggressive.
No report of fevers and no diarrhea, they reported that he had
no BMs since [**4-23**]. He had been receiving Haldol 2mg via G-tube
3-4 times per day and Ativan 0.5mg-1mg for agitation. No report
of other new medications started since recent discharge.
Per his wife and son-in-law, his mental status has been very
variable over the past 2 months. At his best, he is A&Ox1, calm,
and recognized his family members although he is disoriented to
time and place. They reoprt that he has not been sleeping much,
if at all, since arriving to rehab last week.
In the ED, initial VS were: BP 82/36 and SpO2 93% (on trach
mask, FiO2 not recorded, rest of admission VS not recorded). He
was febrile to 101.2 in the ED and received 2g CTX for presumed
UTI (although UA with only 6WBCs and neg nitrite). Also received
1000cc NS and Ativan 0.5mg IV. Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], he
received morphine 4mg IV x2 and Ativan 0.5mg IV x2. He required
frequent trach suctioning and had copious thick secretions. CXR
was not appreciably different from CXR prior to recent
discharge.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T 96.5 HR 99 BP 172/80
RR 20 SpO2 93% on trach mask 35% FiO2. He is agitated, swinging
all 4 extremities and not interactive. Unable to follow simple
commands and does not answer questions.

Imaging:
-CXR ([**2184-4-26**]): Findings most suggestive of mild vascular
congestion without definite pneumonia.  Patchy retrocardiac
opacity appears minor and may be associated with coinciding
atelectasis.  If concern for the possibility of pneumonia
persists, however, then short-term followup radiographs could be
considered, preferably with PA and lateral technique if
feasible.

-CT head ([**2184-4-26**]): Stable appearance of the brain.

-CTA chest/abd/pelvis ([**2184-4-29**]):
1.  Limited assessment of the pulmonary vasculature due to poor
IV access without evidence of central or large pulmonary
embolism.
2.  Heterogeneous renal enhancement.  Correlate with urine
culture to assess for pyelonephritis.
3.  G-J tube bulb within the anterior abdominal wall (rectus
abdominus
muscle).
4.  Small bilateral pleural effusions with dependent atelectasis
vs
consolidations.
5.  Mildly enlarged mediastinal nodes.

-G/J tube change ([**2184-4-30**]): Uncomplicated replacement/exchange
of 18-French MIC GJ tube over a guidewire.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo M with Pt with hx of HTN, HL, OSA, TBI s/p MVC, L open
ankle fracture, R closed ankle fracture and dislocation, s/p PEA
arrest and apnea post-op requiring tracheostomy placement on
[**2184-3-18**] who now presents with AMS and agitation from rehab.
Ultimately, his agitation was thought to be secondary to a
malpositioned GJ tube and possible delirium from a pneumonia.
His mental status at discharge is dramatically improved.  Please
see below.
.
# AMS and agitation: His baseline mental status is very poor
after he suffered from a TBI after an unrestrained MVA earlier
this year.  At his best, he follows commands, nods
appropriately, and makes eye contact with family members.  His
AMS and agitation this admission were likely [**1-8**] pain from
improperly placed G-J tube, may also be from infection as
discussed below.  His agitation was initially controlled with IV
Haldol and Ativan with moderate success.  He briefly required
propofol for agitation.  His CT abd/pelvis showed that his G-J
tube was misplaced with the balloon located in the abdominal
wall.  It is unclear whether pain from this malposition led to
his agitation or whether he pulled the tube during his
agitat
