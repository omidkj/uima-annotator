Brief Hospital Course:
FLOOR COURSE:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with complaint of chest pain found to
have right subsegmental PE and supratherapeutic INR. Patient has
been maintained on room air while INR corrected in setting of
warfarin being held. Two days after admission, patient was found
incontinant of stool face down in her bed, unresponsive. Vitals
at that time were afebrile, SBP 120-130's, HR 110's, RR 12-18,
SpO2 100% RA, she had a pulse and did not appear to have
respiratory difficulty. She was not responsive to verbal or
tactile stimuli. Fingerstick was slightly elevated blood
glucose. Patient recieved small amount of narcotic, Narcan given
and she remained non-responsive. Also noted, patient had
flickering of eyelids, concerning for seizure. She recieved 5mg
ativan with no significant improvement. Due to concern for
possible ICH and inability to protect airway, patient was
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for emergent intubation with plan for
CT Head. Of note, patient was vomitting [**3-14**] to ambu bag.

ICU course:
#Unresponsiveness: Upon further investigation of Ms. [**Known lastname **]
chart, it appears that she has a history of psychogenic
hyporesponsivenss requiring multiple intubations in the past.
Head CT returned negative and neuro team did not feel that this
episode was a seizure. Psych was consulted and said there was
nothing to do while patient was intubated.

#Respiratory Failure: During the code, patient was found to have
vomited resulting in an aspiration pneumonia. She was intubated
and vented and treated with empiric antibiotics. Sputum and
blood cultures grew staph aureus and she was continued on
Vancomycin and Meropenem, [**Last Name (un) **] changed to Linezolid on Day 8 due
to known MRSA in her sputum.  On ICU Day 9, her left lower lobe
asp PNA seems to have cleared, but patient developed a new right
middle lobe infiltrate. She continued to have persistent
infiltrate on CXR L > R and ID was consulted. They recommended
continuing vancomycin therapy for MRSA and also obtaining input
from interventional pulmonology to evaluate for possible
empyema. IP did not feel there was an obvious complicated
effusion present. The patient was continued on the ventilator
and antibiotics. She had persistent hypoxic respiratory failure
requiring increasing levels of PEEP and 100% FiO2. She was
transitioned to APRV when unable to oxygenate on volume cycle
ventilation.  Eventually she was placed back on ACV, but
required 100% FIO2 and high PEEP levels (20's). She desaturated
with any re-positioning adn we were unable to wean from the
ventilator..

#Septic shock: Found to have staph aureus in the blood. She was
hypotensive requiring pressors. By ICU Day 10, patient is still
dependent on pressors.  She continues to spike fevers despite
broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. Blood culture from [**8-19**] grew
coag (-) staph in 1 of 2 sets; patient maintained on vancomycin.
An IJ tip grew yeast and the patient was started on fluconazole
per ID. A urine culture grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] and the patient
was treated with micafungin. The patient remained on pressor
support. The patient remained persistently febrile during her
hospital course. Infectious disease followed the patient each
day. She had documented infections including [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] in
urine, pseudomonas/klebsiella in sinuses, pseudomonas in sputum
as well as urine, and MRSA in lungs. Unfortunately, due to the
patient's body habitus, we were unable to evaluate her for
abscess with CT and had to rely on U/S, which did not show an
obvious abscess or loculated fluid.

#Bipolar: patient was continued on all psych meds as well as her
antidepressants until she began having high OG residuals and she
was not able to tolerate PO meds.

#Diabetes: given ISS, glargine, and closely  monitored glucose
levels. She had an increasing insulin requirement during her ICU
course.

#Guardianship: [**Name2 (NI) **] not found to have a guardian or proxy.
