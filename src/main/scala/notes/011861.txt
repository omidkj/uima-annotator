Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2135-2-23**].
Swan placement.
Intra-aortic balloon pump placement.


History of Present Illness:
79 year-old female new to [**Hospital1 18**] with a history HTN and presumed
CAD who presented to OSH ED the morning of admission with SOB,
orthopnea and LE edema present for the past two months but
worsening over the past week. The night prior to admission her
SOB significantly worsened with the inability to lie flat.
During the previous two days, she reports intermittent left
shoulder pain that she attributed to her bursitis. She denied
any chest pain at that time. Given the difficulty with her
breathing she presenting to the ED. Initial ECG obtained in ED
noted 1mm STE V1-V4. Prior to transfer, she recieved lopressor 5
mg IV, plavix 600 mg, ASA 81 mg X4 tabs, heparin bolus and gtt.
.
On further questioning she describes a "funny" sensation in her
chest that she first noted 6 weeks prior. The patient was
referred to a cardiologist by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] she underwent a
non-exercise stress test and echocardiogram.  Patient unclear of
the results but was under the impression that the findings were
unremarkable. On arrival to CCU post catherization, patient
feels well and is without CP or SOB. No back pain. Minimal groin
discomfort. States that it is the best she has felt in months.
.
Catherization: Severe 3VD as below. Patient was discussed with
cardiac surgery who declined possible CABG given poor distal
targets. IABP inserted. PTCA to mid LAD with fair results. DES
placed mid LCx. Transferred to CCU on IABP for further
management.
.
Remaining cardiac review of systems is notable for abscence of
chest pain or dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain.  All of the other review
of systems were negative in detail.

Past Medical History:
1. Likely CAD (unknown to patient)
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Chornic Bronchitis (non-smoker)
5. Shoulder bursitis

Social History:
Patient denies alcohol or tobacco use.

Family History:
Patient denies family history of coronary disease or sudden
death.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 118/68 lying.  Pulse was 83 beats/min and
regular, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min.
.
General: lying flat in NAD. well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
HEENT: conjunctiva were pink with no pallor or cyanosis of the
oral mucosa.
NECK: supple with JVP difficult to determine [**1-14**] lying flat.
The carotid waveform was normal.  There was no thyromegaly.
CHEST: no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.  The
respirations were a bit rapid but not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. Speaking in full sentences. The lungs
were clear to ascultation anteriorly with normal breath sounds
and no adventitial sounds or rubs.
CARDIAC: PMI nondisplaced. There were no thrills, lifts or
palpable S3 or S4.  The heart sounds revealed a normal S1 and
the S2 was normal. Given sounds of IABP unable to determine
presence of  rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
ABDOMEN: Obese, soft. aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There
was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft
nontender and nondistended.
EXTREMITIES: no pallor, cyanosis, clubbing. trace non-pitting LE
edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Left
and right femoral CVL with minimal oozing.
SKIN: Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed multiple sub keratosis and dysplatic nevi. No
stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars.

Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+  Femoral 2+  Popliteal 2+  DP trace   PT 1+
Left:  Carotid 2+  Femoral 2+  Popliteal 2+  DP trace   PT 1+

[**2135-2-23**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. ST segment elevations in leads V1-V5 with QS
deflections in
leads V1-V3. Q waves in lead V4. These findings are consistent
with acute
anterior and lateral myocardial infarction. Followup and
clinical correlation are suggested. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

Cardiac cath [**2135-2-23**]:
COMMENTS:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
patent. The
LAD had 99% stenosis in the mid vessel with severe diffuse
disease
throughout the mid and distal vessel. The LCX had 95% mid
stenosis. The
ramus had 80% stenosis proximally and 70% stenosis in the mid
vessel.
The RCA had 99% proximal disease and 100% stenosis in the mid
vessel
with left to right collaterals.
2) Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure was 30mmHg and RVEDP
was
30mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures were elevated measuring
65/40mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were elevated (mean
PCW
pressure was 40mmHg). The systemic arterial pressures were
within normal
range measuring 130/80mmHg. The cardiac index was depressed
measuring
1.6 l/min/m2.
3) 34 cc intraaortic balloon pump placed via the left femoral
artery.
4) Successful PTCA of the mid LAD was performed with a 2.5 mm
balloon.
Final angiography revealed appx 30% residual stenosis and severe
diffuse
distal disease.  Stenting was not pursued do to lack of outflow.

5) Successful PTCA and stenting was performed of the CX with a
3.0x33 mm
Cypher stent which was proximally postdilated to 3.5 mm.  Final
angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no dissection, and
normal
flow.  (see PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Depressed cardiac index.
4. IABP placement.
5. Successful PTCA of the mid LAD with severe distal disease and
poor
runoff.
6. Successful PTCA and stenting of the CX with a drug eluting
stent.

Echo [**2135-2-24**]:
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is  moderately dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the anterior wall, septum and apex. There is
hypokinesis of the inferior wall. Basal inferolateral and
lateral segments contract best. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional systolic
dysfunction.  Mild mitral regurgitation (during intraaortic
balloon counterpulsation). Mild pulmonary hypertension
.
