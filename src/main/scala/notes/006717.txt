Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
77F oxygen-dependent severe COPD on 3L at baseline, CHF (EF 25%)
with cor pulmonale, HTN, CAD, HLD presents with 2-month history
of shortness of breath that has worsened compared to the past 5
years. Course with no acute changes. She complains of SOB at
rest relieved with home oxygen and exacerbated by exertion,
which are her usual symptoms. Reason for presentation is VNA
concern for no prescriptions - she ran out of prescription with
no refill for tomorrow. She also has not been taking advair for
> 7 days and will run out of all medications tomorrow. She has
no increased home O2 requirement (3 L continuous). She denied
any signs/symptoms of CHF, COPD exacerbation, or pneumonia. She
otherwise denied any other complaints or concerns.

In the ED, initial VS: 15:26 0 98.7 66 153/120 18 100% 10L
Non-Rebreather. ED staff uncertain why she was initially on
non-rebreather. Patient was cleaned in ED with reddened area to
buttocks. Labs significant for UA with leuk Lg, WBC 18, Bacteria
few. Chem showing K 5.3, HCO3 35, BUN 72, Cr 1.4 (baseline
0.6-0.7). BNP [**Numeric Identifier 84775**] (last prior in [**Month (only) 116**] ~ 12,000), initial
troponin 0.1 (baseline 0.04 - 0.06 with normal Cr). CXR was
performed showing small bilateral pleural effusions, mild CHF,
severe emphysema. She was given combivent neb - improved from
prior interstitial markings. She was given 1 L NS. She was given
ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO qD for urinary tract infection. EKG
similar to prior.

.

The patient was reportedly doing well on the floor on night of
admission, at her home 3L O2 requirement, when she was noted to
be hypoxic to the 60s-70s, tachypneic, and diaphoretic. She was
placed on a NRB with improvement in SpO2 to 100%. BP was noted
to be 200 systolic and she was given hydralazine 25mg IV x1 with
improvement to the low 100s systolic. She was given nebs,
morphine 1mg and furosemide 40mg IV total with minimal output
(though unclear how furosemide-naive she is) with concern for
flash pulmonary edema. CXR showed some increased cephalization
but no new infiltrates or white-out. ABG was 7.41/58/395. A
foley was placed. She continued to be tachypneic and the
decision was made to transfer to the MICU for NIPPV.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with severe COPD, CHF with EF 25%, CAD who presented with
worsening dyspnea for the last 2 months and respiratory distress
necessitating MICU transfer.

# Respiratory distress: Patient has baseline severe emphysema
with very little reserve. Due to her CHF patient may have
developed a component of flash pulmonary edema, as evidenced on
CXR.  She was initiated on NIPPV to support her work of
breathing and treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebs. She
was given furosemide and put on a 4 day course of steroids given
her severe COPD which will end on [**8-19**].  She was weaned down to
NC 4L with saturations in the low 90s. She has occasional
desaturations to 70s with increased activity, but would return
to low 90s with rest.

# Congestive Heart Failure: EF=25% CXR seemed consistent with
pulmonary edema. she was diuresed with furosemide. She was
continued on metoprolol. Her lisinopril was held due to her [**Last Name (un) **],
but will be resumed upon discharge at her rehab facility
according to creatinine improvement.

# CAD: EKG showed worsening ST depressions in lateral precordial
leads upon admission to MICU. However troponins were trending
down, possibly elevation was due to demand ischemia and [**Doctor First Name 48**].
She ruled out for acute coronary syndrome.

# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt was found to have an elevated creatine of 1.4 compared
to the baseline 0.6-0.7. We held her lisinopril and renally
dosed her medications.

#We had a discussion with the patient who stated her desire to
be DNR/DNI.
