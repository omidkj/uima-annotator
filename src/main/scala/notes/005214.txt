IMAGING:
CXR:
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Stable
mild-moderate
cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
DC SUMMARIES:
Brief course: DM1 c/b gastroparesis, ESRD on HD, neuropathy, HTN
who is admitted with 2 days of nausea and vomiting and found to
have hyperglycemia and gap acidosis most likely due to DKA, gap
has closed glycemic control regained, abdominal pain resolved.
.
Active issues:
# DKA: The patient has a h/o of recurrent episodes of DKA and
presents now with similar Sx to prior admissions. Unknown
exacerbating factor although may be related to the patient's
chronic gastroparesis and his N/V over the past 2 days. Also
consider viral URI vs. PNA given the patient's recent productive
cough which has since resolved. The patient reports good
compliance with medications although has been non-compliant in
the past. Other forms of gap acidosis less likely as lactate is
normal and patient was dialyzed yesterday. Is 2 kilos below dry
weight on admission.  Pt had insulin gtt in MICU, with
subsequent hypoglycemia. AG closed. He was transitioned to SC
insulin with normalization of blood sugars.
- FS QID, diabetic diet
- ISS
- SW consult given concern for repeated episodes and medication
non-compliance
- [**Last Name (un) **] saw the patient and made minor adjustments to his
sliding scale, will follow him as an outpatient
.
# Uncontrolled hypertension: The patient was hypertensive on
arrival with BPs up to 200 systolic while here. Most likely
etiology is poor compliance/absorption of home medications given
recent N/V. Also started on a [**Last Name (un) 40899**] patch recently but does
not have on here which may lead to rebound HTN.  BP improved in
MICU and continued to have good pressure control on the floor.
- continue home anti-hypertensives amlodipine, carvedilol,
[**Last Name (un) 40899**], lisinopril, stable
.
#. Elevated troponin - Patient with troponin elevated to 0.27
(0.25 on repeat). Has been elevated to these levels on prior
admission in early [**2146-10-8**]. Most likely due to renal
failure and inability to clear trops. Less likely ACS as no
ischemic changes on ECG or active CP.
-baseline, no need to cycle enzymes
.
# End stage renal disease: renal failure [**2-9**] to DM. HD schedule
on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Sat. Last dialyzed today in MICU. Will have regular
dialysis tomorrow.
- continue HD per schedule
- appreciate renal recs
- continue home sevelamer and Nephrocaps.
