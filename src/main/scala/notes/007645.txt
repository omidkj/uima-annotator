Imaging:
[**2192-8-15**].  CT Head. No acute process seen.
.
[**2192-8-15**].  CXR.  Wet read:  linear opacity right mid lung
concerning for evolving pneumonia, ddx includes atelectasis.
FINAL FINDINGS: Central venous catheter is stable. The study is
extremely limited by patient body
habitus. The right-sided layering pleural effusion is no longer
present.
Linear opacity of the right mid lung may represent evolving
pneumonia or
atelectasis.
.
[**2192-8-16**]  CXR: Linear opacity in the right middle lung is most
likely atelectasis and is unchanged. Allowing the difference in
position of the patient, there is now more clearly visualized
moderate right pleural effusion. There is mild fluid overload.
Main central pulmonary arteries are prominent unchanged from
prior CT from [**2192-6-7**]. Cardiomegaly is mild. Right
subclavian catheter remains in place with tip in the SVC.

[**2192-8-19**] Plain film ABD: Vasculopathy. Paucity of bowel gas is
non-specific. No dilalated loops of small bowel or air fluid
levels to suggest obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Hypotension.  Patient noted to be hypotensive at dialysis
with ongoing blood pressure readings with systolics of 90s
though patient is entirely asymptomatic.  As outpatient, patient
is noted to have SBPs of 130s and 140s.  Most likely dehydration
versus med effect secondary to over-sedation with narcotics.
Patient received 2L IVF and is on HD. Accurate blood pressures
are difficult to attain given patients obesity.  No evidence to
suggest sepsis in spite of concern for pneumonia in ED; patient
denies symptoms of pneumonia, is afebrile and does not have an
elevated WBC.  Also with normal lactate. Antiobiotics were
stopped on admission to the floor. No evidence of blood loss or
EKG changes.  Her antihypertensives and narcotics were held
initailly, and patient's BP remained stable in the ICU, on the
floor and during HD. Home meds were restarted slowly, with no
further drops in BP.
.
2.  Altered mental status.  Patient reportedly somnolent in the
ED, though on admission, per daughter, patient is at her
baseline, though has slept more frequently during the day than
normal. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to OSA (and lack of consistent BIPAP
use), depression (patient tearful on exam), or overmedication
with opioids. Head CT in ED unchanged.  Patient noted to have
PCO2 of 51 on admission, which is increased from the past.
Patient back at basline by transfer from ICU and rest of
hospital stay. Patient restarted on home psych meds.
.
3.  Diabetes.  Continued standing humalog and HISS. Serum
glucose remained in the 100s to 200s throughout the
hospitalization.
.
4.  OSA.  Patient noted to have elevated CO2 on admission.  This
may have contributed to patient's somnolence in ED.  Patient
reports she ws not using bipap every night. Continued on BIPAP
at night without difficulty, although the patient will take off
the BiPAP after only a few hours use per night due to
discomfort.
.
5.  Hyperkalemia.  No evidence of EKG changes on admission.
Given kayexelate x 1. Received HD x2 with resolution of
hyperkalemia. No further episodes during hospital stay.
.
6.  CAD.  Unclear why patient is on plavix; patient does not
report history of stent placement. Continued aspirin, statin,
plavix during hospital stay.
.
7.  ESRD on HD. Continued phos binders, nephrocaps, and dialysis
MWF. Received dialysis on [**8-20**], [**8-20**] and [**8-22**]. Spoke with
transplant surgery team, and it was decided to evaluate the
patient as an outpatient for an AV graft.
.
8.  Nausea/vomiting. The patient developed nausea and vomiting
on [**2192-8-19**]. After one day of ice chips and around the clock
anti-emetics, the N/V subsided. The patient was taking po
without problems the rest of the hospital stay.
.
9.  Dispo. Patient was ready to go back to Rehab on Friday
([**8-17**]), but needed to be rescreened by the Rehab facility.
Stayed through the weekend, as this did not take place until
Monday [**8-20**]. She was rejected by her previous Rehab, and got a
bed at a new Rehab. Unfortunately, the patient's HD slot was
lost, and she was re-placed, which took an additional week in
the hospital to coordinate.
