PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate of 84, blood
pressure of 110/60, respiratory rate of 20, O2 saturation of
99% on room air. GENERAL: In no acute distress. NEURO: Alert
and oriented x 3. Moves all extremities. A nonfocal exam.
HEENT: Mucous membranes are moist. NECK: Supple. Carotids are
2+ without bruits. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC: Irregular rate, S1/S2. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender and
nondistended. EXTREMITIES: Warm and 1+ bilateral edema.
PULSES: Femoral 2+ bilaterally, radial 2+ bilaterally and
dorsalis pedis 1+ bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 5.8, hematocrit of 36, PT of
14, PTT of 59, INR of 1.3, sodium of 138, potassium of 4.9,
chloride of 100, CO2 of 28, BUN of 27, creatinine of 1.1,
glucose of 121. LFTs were all within normal limits.

RADIOLOGIC AND OTHER STUDIES:  Chest CT done on [**8-4**]
showed bilateral ground-glass opacities.

Carotid exam showed less than 40% lesions bilaterally.

Cardiac cath showed proximal LAD 90%, circumflex with 30% to
70% lesions and a diffuse RCA stenosis with an ejection
fraction of 43%. Additionally, he had 4+ mitral
regurgitation.

TEE showed an ejection fraction of 30% to 35% with severe MR
and global LV hypokinesis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission, the patient was brought to
the operating room where he underwent mitral valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting. Please see
the OR report for full details. In summary, the patient had a
MVR with a #33 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve and a
CABG x 1 with a LIMA to the LAD. His bypass time was 94
minutes with a cross-clamp time of 74  minutes. He tolerated
the operation well and was transferred from the operating
room to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. At the time
of transfer the patient's mean arterial pressure was 71 with
a CVP of 10. He was A-paced at a rate of 60 beats per minute.
He had epinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min, milrinone at 0.5
mcg/kg/min, Neo-Synephrine at 1.4 mcg/kg/min and propofol at
30 mcg/min.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
His anesthesia was reversed. He was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated. Throughout the
operative day, the patient was weaned from his cardioactive
IV medications; and by postoperative day 2, the patient's
milrinone was weaned to off. At that time it was decided that
he was stable and ready for transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Two for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation over
the next several days. With the assistance of the nursing
staff and physical therapy, the patient's activity level was
advanced.

On postoperative day 3, his temporary pacing wires were
removed; and on postoperative day 4, it was decided that the
patient would be stable and ready for discharge on the
following day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  At the time of this
dictation, the patient's physical exam is as follows. VITAL
SIGNS: Temperature of 98, heart rate of 72 (V-paced), blood
pressure of 108/68, respiratory rate of 20, O2 saturation of
98% on room air. Weight preoperatively of 69 kilos; at the
time of discharge was 72 kilos. NEURO: Alert and oriented x
3. Moves all extremities. Follows commands. A nonfocal exam.
PULMONARY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIAC:
