Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**]
Chief Complaint:
decreased PO intake, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of central lines and dialysis catheter
placement of chest tubes x3

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old female with a history of diabetes,
bipolar, CHF, HTN and atrial fibrillation who presented to the
ED as she was found to be lethargic at home. Per family she has
been having 3-4 days of increasing lethargy. A finger stick was
noted to be 29. She has been having more nausea and a dry cough
and decreased PO intake.
.
Of note patient had been having hyperkalemia recently per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] notes. ACE-i had been held two weeks prior and K had
normalized by [**5-10**].
.
In the ED initial vitals were: 96.0 60 146/46 24 98%. Exam
showed kussmal respirations and patient "looked bad", very
lethargic. ECG showed QRS at 160. She was given calcium and
bicarb. Kayexelate was not given for mental status. Patient was
noticed to have dips of SBP to 90s. CXR with increased
interstitial markings and was sat O2 sats remained 100% 3L
breathing at 18. Labs sig for severe acidosis. Renal was
consulted and recommended forced diuresis which ED did not do as
her BP was tenuous.
.
Meds given in ED: 4 amps calc gluc, 4 amps Na bicarb, 3 amps
D50, 20 U regular insuln (2 separate doses), Vanc, Zosyn, 2L
fluid - Put out total of 500cc urine.

IMAGING:
[**2153-5-13**] CXR: There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature
and interstitial markings, most consistent with mild pulmonary
edema. There are no focal areas of consolidation. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly is stable to
slightly worsened since the prior study. Hilar contours are
within normal limits. There is calcification of the aortic knob,
unchanged. Linear atelectasis is noted at the lung bases
bilaterally. Findings most consistent with mild CHF.
.
[**2153-5-14**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-11-23**], left ventricular
