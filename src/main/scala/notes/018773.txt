MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2-3**], [**2-4**], [**2189-2-6**] C. Diff:
[**2189-2-2**] and [**2189-2-6**] Blood cultures: negative
[**2189-2-6**] Urine cultures: negative

IMAGING:
[**2189-2-2**] ADMISSION CXR:
1. NG tube projects below the stomach, although the sideport is
at GE
junction; recommend advancement if tube to be used for feeding.
2. ETT in standard position.
3. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

[**2189-2-2**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. Mild pancolitis without extramural abnormality.
2. Findings suggestive of mild acute pancreatitis.

[**2189-2-2**] NCHCT:
Although there are no definte findings to
suggest infarction, there is generalized loss of grey white
contrast, and
small sulci. This is particularly prominent in the temporal
lobes, and raises a concern of possible global ischemia or
hypoxia. Comparison with the prior head CT, a follow up CT, and
an MR examination would be helpful if this fits with the
clinical presentation.

[**2189-2-5**] NCHCT:
Hypoattenuating region within the right frontal lobe (2:12)
which
appears to have been present on previous study however less
conspicuous. This may represent a artifact or small vessel
disease, however, an underlying lesion cannot be entirely
excluded and non-urgent MRI may be obtained for further
evaluation.

[**2189-2-10**] MRI HEAD:
Saccular formation is identified on the bifurcation of the
middle
cerebral artery on the left measuring less than 3 mm in size
consistent with a saccular aneurysmatic formation as described
in detail above. There is no evidence of stenosis or vasospasm.
Anatomical variant consistent with hypoplasia of the A1 segment
on the right, both anterior cerebral arteries are filling
through the left side.

[**2189-2-8**] EEG:
This is an abnormal EEG in the waking and sleeping states due to
intermittent very brief bursts of mixed frequency slowing in the
left temporal region, raising the possibiltiy of subcortical
dysfunction there. The tracing cannot specify the etiology.
There were no associated epileptiform features. The slow
background indicates a widespread encphalopathic process, with
the most common causes being metbolic disturbances, infection or
medication.


Brief Hospital Course:
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:
Unclear cause. She was hypoglycemic in the field, and there was
some concern for metformin overmedication with metabolic
acidosis.  Tox screens were negative. She has an LP at the OSH
prior to transfer and was kept on acyclovir empirically while
viral studies were pending (they were returned negative on [**2-7**],
and acyclovir was discontinued).  Empiric vancomycin and zosyn
were discontinued once cultures returned negative.  The
nuerology and toxicology services were following the patient.
Depakote levels were in therapeutic range.  EEG was performed on
[**2-8**] to see if AMS was from seizure activity; toxic-metabolic
abnormalities, but no sz activity.  Brain MRI on [**2189-2-10**] showed
small LMCA aneurysm and mild meningeal enhancement c/w post-LP
changes.  She was kept on thiamine, folate, and a multivitamin
while in house.  All cultures/microbiology data were negative.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Patient had a brief MICU stay and was intubated for respiratory
failure in the setting of a profound metabolic acidosis.

THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ANEMIA:
Blood counts were slowly decreasing over the admission.  There
was no evidence of gross blood loss, and DIC labs on admission
were negative. Depakote may cause BM suppression but given long
duration of treatment and higher CBC earlier in hospital course,
it was less likely to be causing the current
thrombocytopenia/anemia.  HIT antibody was negative.  Her low
counts were ultimately thought to be from bone marrow
suppression in the setting of metabolic acidosis and acute
illness.  Platelet counts evetually recovered; Hct was low but
stable ~21 prior to discharge.

DIARRHEA:
Patient was complaining of diarrhea.  C. diff was negative x 3.
Stool cultures were negative.
