Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1350**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral thigh pain and left sided foot drop

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L3-L5 lateral lumbar interbody fusion followed by L3-S1
laminectomy  and fusion with L5-S1 Transforaminal lumbar
interbody fusion.


History of Present Illness:
50-
year-old female with a progressive and disabling syndrome of
degenerative scoliosis as well as spinal stenosis. This did
cause a syndrome of back and leg pain which did interfere
with her ability to walk. She underwent a prolonged and
progressive and multimodal course of conservative care, but
despite this, her symptoms were not relieved. Due to the
progressive nature of syndrome, the history of this disorder,
the refractory nature of the syndrome, and the severity of
symptoms, she did elect to undergo surgical treatment.

more than ~45 minutes without getting up and walking around.

worn when you are walking. You may take it off when sitting in a
chair or while lying in bed.

-	Wound Care: Remove the dressing in 2 days.  If the incision is
draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.  If it is dry
then you can leave the incision open to the air.  Once the
incision is completely dry (usually 2-3 days after the
operation) you may take a shower. Do not soak the incision in a
bath or pool.  If the incision starts draining at anytime after
surgery, do not get the incision wet. Cover it with a sterile
dressing.  Call the office.
