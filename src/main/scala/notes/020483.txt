Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 974**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventral Hernia

History of Present Illness:
65yo M admitted for plasmapheresis in advance of elective
ventral hernia repair. He has had a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]
(AChR positive) since [**2106**], when he presented with dysarthria.

He was treated initially with mestinon/steroids and then
cellcept, which was discontinued due to its cost. He then
presented in myasthenic crisis in [**2106**] with
dysarthria, dysphagia and respiratory distress and was
intubated,
treated first with plasmapheresis and then IVIG.

His course was then complicated in [**3-15**] when he again went into
myasthenic exacerbation, this time in the context of bowel
perforation and repair. After this exacerbation, imuran was
added
to his regimen.

Since this time, he has had no further exacerbations. However,
he
continues to have symptoms of myasthenia. In [**2109-6-9**], he
presented to clinic reporting difficulty chewing for prolonged
periods of time, as well as mild dysarthria and mild dyspnea on
exertion and ptosis only when tired. Imuran was increased as he
was not felt to be fully in remission.

Since [**Month (only) **], he feels that the difficulty chewing has improved a
bit. He has stable dyspnea on exertion that he feels may be
related to cardiac disease. He continues to deny diplopia or
dysphagia. He has no hoarseness and no weakness of his limbs. He
does get ptosis when fatigued.

He denies side effects of excessive mestinon use.

CT abd/pelvis: 1. Two stones, side by side, measuring up to 7
mm, within the distal CBD at the level of the pancreatic head
without significant intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. 2.
Single 2-cm intra-abdominal collection in the left upper
quadrant, smaller in size to the CT of [**2108**].  3. Large ventral
hernia containing multiple loops of small and large bowel
overall unremarkable in appearance. Right-sided diverting
colostomy. 4. New wedge deformity of the T11 vertebral body,
consistent with a compression fracture of indeterminate age.
Multiple other compression fractures of the lower thoracic and
lumbar spine as described.

Abd U/S: Confirmation of two small stones within the distal
common bile
duct. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation seen. Collapsed
gallbladder with
stones and sludge.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-22**] for plasmapheresis (5 doses, QOD, prior to
surgery).  He had a pharasis catheter placed in IR with no
complications.  Upon admission he was started on a heparin drip
for a-fib.  His PTT was maintained between 50-70.  Medicine was
consulted on [**10-23**] for assistance with anticoagulation
peri-plasmapheresis (continued on heparin gtt).  CT abd/pelvis
on [**10-31**] demonstrated two CBD stones (confirmed on [**11-1**]
ultrasound) and a large ventral hernia containing loops of
small and large bowel. Levo/flagyl started on [**11-3**] (day #1) and
given through [**11-9**]. A pre-op colonoscopy was performed, which
demonstrated a single cecal polyp (shown on pathology to be
adenoma). Transaminases were mildly elevated (AST 58, ALT 43) at
the time of admission. He underwent successful retrieval of his
choledocholithiasis on [**11-4**] via ERCP. His mestinon was tapered
prior to surgery. He underwent colostomy takedown, repair of
ventral hernia with mesh, cholecystectomy, and coloproctostomy
on
[**2109-11-8**] without complications. He was admitted to the SICU post
op for observation, given his history of post op myasthenic
crises requiring re-intubation.

On [**11-14**], some purulent drainage was noted near the site of the
post-op drain; ciprofloxacin and vancomycin were started. The
wound was swabbed and sent for gram stain and culture. Gram
stain showed 1+ PMN's and 1+ GPC's in chains; subsequent
culture, finalized on [**11-17**], showed moderate MRSA and sparse
Enterobacter
(R to ciproflox). Drainage continued since [**11-14**], and a wound vac
was applied on [**11-17**].

[**11-19**] - Wound vac changed with white sponge. Seen by ID with
recs for 2 weeks of Vanco and Meropenem from wound cx's.

[**11-20**] - Doing well, no acute issues, awaiting disposition

[**11-22**] - vac dressing taken down, wet to dry dressing applied
while awaiting placement today
