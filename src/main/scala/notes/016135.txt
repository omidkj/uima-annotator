Service:  CT [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old gentleman
who was admitted on [**2106-7-30**], presenting with acute
respiratory distress and angina pain.  He had a three year
history of dyspnea on exertion, worse over the several weeks
prior to admission with the addition of new onset anginal
pain with exertion.  His cardiac risk factors included
smoking and a family history of coronary artery disease.

At the time of his initial workup, the patient was noted to
have electrocardiogram changes suggestive of ischemia as well
as enzyme levels ruling him in for a myocardial infarction.
The patient was subsequently admitted.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was afebrile
with a blood pressure of 114/60, a pulse of 70, a respiratory
rate of 12 and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air.  His
jugular venous pressure was at 8 cm.  He had bilateral
crackles, right greater than left.  His heart had a regular
rate and rhythm.  He had a IV/VI systolic ejection murmur at
the left upper sternal border that radiated to his carotids.
His abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended with normal
active bowel sounds.  His extremities were warm and well
perfused.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As the patient ruled in for an acute
myocardial infarction by enzyme and electrocardiogram
criteria, he was admitted and started on an integrelin drip
and heparin drip as well as p.o. aspirin and Plavix.  The
integrelin and heparin drips both needed to be discontinued
secondary to developing hematuria.

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization, which
revealed 50% occlusion of the left anterior descending
artery, 60% occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery,
90% occlusion of the posterior right coronary artery and 70%
occlusion of the mid right coronary artery as well as a
critical aortic stenosis with an approximately 80 mmHg
gradient.  Cardiothoracic surgery was subsequently consulted
and the decision was made that the patient should undergo
aortic valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass
grafting.

The patient's preoperative hospital course was uneventful.
He was hemodynamically stable and afebrile.  On [**2106-8-3**], the patient underwent uncomplicated coronary artery
bypass grafting times one with a saphenous vein graft to the
major obtuse marginal artery as well as an aortic valve
replacement with a #21 [**Location (un) **] bioprosthesis.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the
cardiac surgery recovery unit intubated and in stable
condition.

In the unit, the patient was unable to be extubated initially
secondary to respiratory acidosis.  He was on Neo-Synephrine
and nitroglycerin drips for blood pressure control as well as
a dobutamine drip.  In the early morning of postoperative day
#1, the patient had been weaned to CPAP and was subsequently
extubated without incident.  He was started on Lopressor, the
Neo-Synephrine and dobutamine drips were weaned and his
nitroglycerin drip was discontinued.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was arousable, moving
all extremities to command.  His chest tubes and Foley
catheter were discontinued and his diet was advanced.  He was
noted to have a wide complex tachycardia and was started on
amiodarone.  By the end of postoperative day #2, the patient
was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  On the
floor, the patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically
stable.

The only major issue that the patient had was his delirium,
which necessitated the placement of a one-to-one sitter.  All
sedating medications were held and the patient was frequently
oriented with no effect.  A psychiatry consultation was
obtained, who recommended that the patient be started on low
dose Haldol 0.5 mg b.i.d. in an effort to clear up his
delirium.  This was started on postoperative day #7, at which
time his one-to-one sitter was discontinued.  He had no
events overnight.  On the morning of postoperative day #8,
the patient's mental status seemed to be intact.

The patient was subsequently discharged in stable condition
to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative day #8.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times one week.
2.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times one week.

4.  Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. every three to four
hours p.r.n.
8.  Albuterol nebulizers every four hours p.r.n.
9.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Captopril 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.
11. Haldol 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
12. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. times two days, then 400 mg
p.o. b.i.d. times seven days, then 400 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with stable
vital signs.  He was in no acute distress.  He was alert and
oriented times three.  He had decreased breath sounds on the
left with bilateral wheezing.  His heart had a regular
rhythm.  His belly was soft, nontender and nondistended.  His
extremities were warm and well perfused.  His incisions were
clean, dry and intact.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Coronary artery disease.
Congestive heart failure.
Critical aortic stenosis.
Status post coronary artery bypass grafting times one and
aortic valve replacement.
