Admission Date:  [**2109-3-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2109-4-4**]

Date of Birth:   [**2043-5-31**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old male with
a complicated medical history who was transferred from
[**Hospital **] Hospital with renal failure and metabolic acidosis.

He had also complained of odynophagia and difficulty with a
severe feeling of thirst.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management of his
metabolic acidosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft 17 years ago with a preserved ejection fraction
as of [**2109-1-7**].
2.  Type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine
of 2).
4.  Cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcohol (Child class
A)
5.  Peripheral vascular disease; status post right-sided
below-knee amputation.
6.  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; specifically in
the right mandibular region which was diagnosed in [**2105**];
status post radiation therapy.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed heart rate was 104, blood pressure was
94/60, oxygen saturation was 98% on room air, and temperature
was 98, and respiratory rate was 18.  In general, the patient
was very agitated and was not cooperative with the
examination.  He did not appear to be in acute respiratory
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed his pupils were reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were full.  Sclerae were muddy and injected.  There
was no clear icterus or subungual jaundice.  The neck
revealed no jugular venous distention.  The lungs were clear
to auscultation anteriorly with decreased breath sounds at
the right posterior base.  Heart was irregularly irregular
and tachycardic.  Normal first heart sounds and second heart
sounds.  There was no third heart sounds or fourth heart
sounds appreciated.  A 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex was
appreciated.  The abdomen revealed decreased bowel sounds.
Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Liver was palpable four
fingerbreadths below the costal margin.  Extremity
examination revealed there was palmar erythema.  The patient
was status post right below-knee amputation.  There was no
pedal edema on the left.  Neurologic examination revealed
awake, alert and oriented times three.  There was no facial
droop.  The tongue was midline.  Extraocular movements were
full.  Shoulder shrug was equal, [**4-14**] bilaterally.  Grimace
was symmetric.  He had left pronator drift.  Otherwise, motor
strength was [**4-14**] throughout.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent
laboratory findings on admission revealed an arterial blood
gas of 7.10/18/126.  White blood cell count was 12.,
hematocrit was 31.7, and platelets were 124.  Chemistry-7 was
notable for a potassium of 6.2, bicarbonate was 7, with a
creatinine of 6.9, and glucose was 135.  Anion gap was
calculated at 20.  AST was 52, ALT was 25, alkaline
phosphatase was 120, and a total bilirubin of 0.3.  Creatine
kinase was 1018 on admission.  Lactate was 0.8.  FENa was
calculated at 0.8%.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the time
of admission revealed a rate of 100 and was a normal sinus
rhythm at that time, with normal axis and intervals.  There
were no peaked T waves or ST-T wave changes noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   This was a 74-year-old
male with an extensive past medical history who was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] with
severe metabolic acidosis, acute-on-chronic renal failure,
history of Child class A cirrhosis, coronary artery disease,
and type 2 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

1.  METABOLIC ACIDOSIS ISSUES:  The metabolic acidosis was
felt to be an anion gap acidosis; secondary to either ongoing
alcohol abuse (which was an issue for this patient), or
possibly diabetic ketoacidosis or starvation ketoacidosis.

Diabetic ketoacidosis was not felt to be the leading cause,
as his glucose was never high.  Nonetheless, he was insulin
dependent.

His acidosis improved somewhat with aggressive hydration and
nutrition; however, never completely normalized during his
hospital course.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient ruled in for
a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and had a transthoracic
echocardiogram showing new regional wall motion abnormalities
with a dyskinetic left ventricle.

He was started on a heparin drip to prevent thrombus.
Coumadin was never stated on the patient.

3.  RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had an acute tubular
necrosis with a FENa that was less than 1%; however, his
creatinine clearance never improved during his hospital stay.

Despite aggressive hydration, and renally dosing medications,
as well as holding ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
blockers, the patient's creatinine never improved.  His urine
output continued to deteriorate during his hospital course
and in the Intensive Care Unit prior to his death.

4.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  During his hospital course,
the patient had hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
intubated and was also quite difficult to ventilate;
requiring the use of paralytics.

The patient's respiratory course was complicated difficulty
clearing secretions by the patient as well as
hospital-acquired pneumonia.   Sputum cultures did grow out
Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient was covered with
appropriate antibiotics.

5.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course was also complicated by atrial fibrillation with a
rapid ventricular response; requiring atrioventricular nodal
blockade with a calcium channel blocker or a beta blocker.

6.  DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION ISSUES:  The
patient did have disseminated intravascular coagulation
toward the end of his hospitalization; presumably secondary
to profound infection.

On the day prior to his death, his urine output continued to
be very marginal after aggressive fluid hydration.  His
maximum urine output was only 40 cc per hour.  Sediment
continued to reveal a muddy brown cast consistent with acute
tubular necrosis; however, his FENa was always less than 1%.
His heart rate decreased to the 40s and 50s on the afternoon
prior to his death; showing a sinus arrhythmia and
ventricular escape beats.  There were no ST elevations.  His
electrolytes were repleted at that time.

His overall prognosis was extremely poor because of his renal
failure and sepsis which was complicated by disseminated
intravascular coagulation.  This was communicated to Mrs.
[**Known lastname 41304**], the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, who stated that Mr.
[**Known lastname 41304**] would not have wanted extensive life support.  His
wife agreed to withdrawing care on [**2109-4-3**], and she
stated that he would not have wanted an autopsy done.  On
[**2109-4-4**], the patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Renal failure.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Heart failure.
4.  Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Congestive heart failure.
