History of Present Illness:
63 yo M with h/o cirrhosis, DM, h/o 1st degress AV block, who
presetned with 1 day of fever. Today, lethargic and confused,
but oriented. Sent to ED for further evaluation.
.
He was recently d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] where his course was notable for
acute on chronic renal failure (thought to be prerenal, resolved
on its own); hyperkalemia; a negative abd US; anemia with guiac
+ stools and 2 units PRBCs.
.
While at home, he took 80 mg lasix x 2 days and aldactone 200 mg
x 2 days per his renal physician.
.
In the ED, 102.1, 127, 101/64, 88% RA. Paracentesis done which
showed some WBC, but no SBP. JVP elevated in ED. BP dropped to
mid 70's/40-60's after paracentesis. Desatted to 80's on 4 L NC
and placed on NRB. Given 1 gm vancomycin, levofloxacin 500 mg
IV, flagyl 500 mg IV and tylenol 650 mg. Surgical consult recc.
CT abd and abx. 2500 cc IVF given.
.
On arrival, pt was arousable, answered questions and was
oriented. He stated his breathign was bad since d/c, denied CP,
+nausea, not eating much by mouth. He easily was drowsy making
it difficult to obtain other history.
.
Admitted to the MICU for sepsis.

Studies:
[**3-14**] CXR: IMPRESSION:  Moderate/mild pulmonary edema.
.
EKG#1: 1st degree AVB, sinus tachy, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] dep in I, [**Street Address(2) 1766**]
dep in v1-2, priors were paced
.
EKG #2: tachycardic, NSR with 1st degree AVB, ST elevation in
v1/v2 1-2 mm
.
[**3-14**] Abd US:
IMPRESSION:
1.  1.5-cm focus adherent to the anterior wall of the
gallbladder is again seen and unchanged that may represent a
polyp.
2.  Sludge and debris within the gallbladder with no gallbladder
wall edema.
3.  No biliary ductal dilatation.
4.  Ascites with a cirrhotic liver.
.
[**2168-3-15**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20
percent) with
relative sparing of contractile function at the base of the left
ventricle.  The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic  shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main
pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are
dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.
No definite valvular vegetations seen.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2167-10-29**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
markedly reduced; the effective aortic valve orifice area is
reduced further. The absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically
suggested.
.
[**2168-3-17**] Renal U/S:
CONCLUSION:
1. Normal kidneys.
2. Ascites.
.
[**2168-3-19**] MRI Left foot:
IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal signal and enhancement within the distal first,
second, fourth and fifth metatarsals, as described above.
Involvement is more extensive in the fourth and fifth
metatarsals. Findings most consistent with osteomyelitis. No
drainable fluid collections are identified.
2. Extensive erosive and osteoarthritic changes within the foot,
as described above. Findings consistent with history of
rheumatoid arthritis, although there likely is a component of
neuropathic arthropathy.
.
[**2168-3-21**] Post pyloric NGT placement:
IMPRESSION: Successful [**Last Name (un) **]-intestinal tube placement.
.
[**2168-3-22**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the distal half of the septum
and anterior walls. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic.
The remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic. No definite
thrombus is seen. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root and
ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic valve appears
functionally bicuspid with fused right and non-corona
