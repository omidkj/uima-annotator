HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2106-8-10**] and
was subsequently operated on for mitral valve replacement on
[**2106-8-10**].  Her past medical history included mitral
regurgitation.  Postoperatively, the patient developed sinus
ventricular tachycardia.  The electrophysiology service was
consulted.  Apparently, the electrophysiology consultant did

attributed it to the past myocardial infarction.  They
recommended continuing on medication and will follow up the
patient with Holter monitoring in one month.

condition was stable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  The wounds were clean
with no drainage and no pus.  The incisions were intact.  The

clear to auscultation with some rales bilaterally at the
bilateral lung bases.  The heart was in regular rhythm.
