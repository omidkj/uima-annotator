Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course: Briefly, this is a 55 yo man with h/o COPD, OSA,
conversion d/o, s/p gastric bypass surgery, found unresponsive
with apnea during his sleep study.  A code was called and the
pts ABG at that time (5:11am) was: 7.37/51/316. The pt was
stabilized and transferred to the ED.  The pt was started on a
narcan gtt, however his tox screen was negative for opiates.
The  etiology of the pts unresponsiveness was unclear but was
felt to be  due to the pts history of conversion disorder.  The
pt has multiple episodes of "unresponsiveness" however during
these episodes the pt responded to pain, eyelash touch.  Head Ct
was unrevealing and thyroid/cortisol studies were wnl.  In the
afternoon, the pts ABG improved to 7.39/49/124 at 1:18 pm. The
pt has had extensive workup for these episodes at [**Hospital1 2025**] in the
past and they have been attributed to a psychiatric history.
.
# Unresponsiveness/syncope:  The underlying etiology was not
entirely clear. Extensive work ups were done in the past at [**Hospital1 2025**]
for multiple unresponsiveness episodes. All results were
negative. In the [**Hospital Unit Name **], it was observed that pt became
unresponsive several times at night and during the day.  His
breathing rate decreased, but all his other vital signs remained
stable during the entire episode. No evidence of seizure or
cardiac ischemia. Thyroid and cortisol studies were wnl. No
evidence of brady or tachy arrhythmias.  CT head was
unrevealing. Conversion d/o was agreed upon as the diagnosis.
The pt is to follow up with his outpatient psychiatrist on his
sleep study, and psych issues (ie. stresses). The pt was deemed
not to have suidical ideation at the time of discharge.
.
# OSA:  Pt has long history of obstructive sleep apnea. Pt was
put on BIPAP and 2L O2 NC at night. That was continued during
his stay at the icu. The psychiatrist will review the sleep
study with him as an outpatient. It is not clear whether he has
vocal cord dysfunction.
.
# COPD:  Pt has chronic pulmonary problem for many years.  He
was continued on home medications during his icu stay. The
medications are atrovent, albuterol, neb, ipratropium bromide
mdi, tiotropium bromide 1 tab qd.
.
# Sinus bradycardia improved after beta blocker was hold.
.
# Abd/flank pain: CT shows mild spleenomegaly. Past HIV test w
