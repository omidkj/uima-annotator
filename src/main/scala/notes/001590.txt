Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
right arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 year old male with history of epilepsy that was
found at the bottom of a flight of 15 stairs presumably after
falling. He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he complained of
right arm pain and was combative. He was intubated in the
emergency department for airway protection secondary to his
combativeness. The patient was found to have a difficult airway
and anesthesia was paged. In the ED, a 7cm L frontal laceration
was closed using staples. At the time of this exam, the patient
was intubated and thrashing and medical history as well as a
review of systems was not obtained. The patient has been
transferred to the TSICU and the following injuries have been
identified since admission to the hospital left zigomatic
fracture,left sphenoid sinus fracture,left lateral orbital
non-displaced fracture, Sternal fracture,L3, T15, T12, C6
compressions,Small anterior mediastinal hematoma, bilateral
posterior lung consolidation ,right distal radial fracture.
Neurosurgery has been asked to consult regarding the patients
Head CT from [**2187-10-7**] which is consistent with a left frontal
punctate hemorrhage.

[**2187-10-7**] Head CT : 1. Punctate focus of hyperdensity in the left
frontal lobe, could be artifact; however, cannot exclude
hemorrhagic focus, and short-term followup CT recommended.
  2. Fracture at the left zygomatic arch, of indeterminate age.
Fracture to the left sphenoid sinus. Non-displaced fracture of
the posterior lateral wall of the left orbit. Fracture through
the left sphenoid laterally that is an inferior continuation of
a frontal bone fracture.
  3. Left frontal soft tissue hematoma.

[**2187-10-7**] CT C spine :
No acute fracture seen. Multilevel degenerative changes in the
cervical spine.

[**2187-10-7**] CT Torso : 1. Bilateral posterior lung consolidation,
could be aspiration or partial collapse.
2. Small anterior mediastinal hematoma with adjacent
nondisplaced sternal
fracture.
3. Attenuated splenic vein, age indeterminate, but with
collaters seen. IVC filter in place with more distal IVC
markedly attenuated, likely from chronic occlusion. Numerous
collateral vessels seen.
4. Hypodense left renal lesion, measuring Hounsfield units
greater than that typical for a simple cyst. Recommend further
evaluation with ultrsaound in a nonurgent setting.
5. Hyperenhancing focus in segment IVB of the liver, followup
with multiphase CT or MRI in a nonurgent setting.
6. Superior compression of T6, T8, and L3, as well as anterior
wedging of T12 vertebral bodies, of indeterminate age; correlate
with point tenderness.
7. Right shoulder degenerative change with possible joint loose
body.
Findings can be further evaluated starting with MRI if not
already evaluted previously.
8. Linear high density in sacral canal, could be calcification,
or vessels.

[**2187-10-7**] right wrist : Comminuted fracture of the distal radius
with mild displacement. Mildly displaced fracture of the ulnar
styloid. Prominent soft tissue swelling.

[**2187-10-8**] MRI spine : 1. Multiples vertebral body compression
deformities in the thoracic and lumbar spine which appear
chronic. There is no evidence of underlying bone marrow lesions,
suggesting that the fractures may be osteoporotic, unusual for
the patient's age.
  2. The most significant, moderate T12 compression fracture is
associated with mild retropulsion and a mild kyphotic angulation
at T11-12, without mass effect on the spinal cord.
  3. Multilevel cervical spondylosis with approximately moderate
spinal canal stenosis and moderate neural foraminal narrowing,
somewhat suboptimally evaluated due to artifacts. While the
spinal cord is deformed from C4-5 through C6-7, no definite cord
signal abnormalities are seen.
  4. Multilevel lumbar spondylosis. Severe right neural
foraminal narrowing at L4-5 and L5-S1, with compression of the
exiting L4 and L5 nerve roots. Abutment and possible compression
of the traversing right L5 nerve root in the subarticular recess
at L4-5.

[**2187-10-8**] Head CT :
  1. The previously identified left frontal punctate
hyperdensity is not
identified on this study. No new intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Prominence of the CSF spaces overlying the hemispheres, right
greater than left, may reflect chronic subdural collections,
more conspicuous on the right in comparison to one day prior,
which may reflect differences in positioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19961**] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma
team and then admitted to the Trauma ICU for further management.
 He was intubated in the ER for airway protection though alert
and oriented prior to this. Following an uneventful twenty four
hour period in the ICU he was easily extubated and although had
a very flat affect he was neurologically intact.  His
Neurologist from [**Hospital6 1708**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
he was placed on all of his pre admission anti seizure
medications.

He was seen by the Ortho-spine service due to multiple
compression fractures noted on CT to determine if they were old
or new.  After reviewing the MRI with Radiology it was
determined that all the fractures were old.  he had no back pain
to palpation and his activity was changed to out of bed as
tolerated.

The Neurosurgery service was following his clinical exam and
head CT's.  As there was no change in his exam and his Head CT
was unchanged after 24 hours they recommended a follow up head
CT in 4 weeks and a follow up appointment at that time.
The Opthomology Service examined Mr. [**Known lastname 19961**] and the globes were
intact but the would like to fully examine him as an out patient
so that his eyes can be dilated.

The Plastic surgery service will follow hi
