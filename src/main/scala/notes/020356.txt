Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
scrotal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-8-20**]
Debridement of perineum total scrotectomy

[**2135-8-24**]
Exploratory laparotomy with end-colostomy and
perineal examination with wound dressing change

[**2135-9-2**]
testicles resited
percutaneous tracheostomy

[**2135-9-3**]
reexploration of perineum for bleeding

[**2135-9-28**]
1. Debridement of open perineal wound skin, subcutaneous
    tissue.
2. Local advancement flap closure of perineal wound 35 cm2.


History of Present Illness:
62M h/o DM, HTN, CAD s/p CABG presented with 2 week h/o scrotal
pain/tenderness and malaise. On exam, he was noted to have a
large necrotic ulcer at the base of the scrotum and U/S was
consistent with air and fluid collection at the base of the
scrotum. Additionally, the pt had leukocytosis and elevated
lactate, suggestive of Fournier's gangrene. He was taken to the
OR emergently for debridement. Stable OR course, required
removal of majority of scrotum due to necrosis. Received 1 unit
PRBC, on low-dose neo en route to SICU.

Past Medical History:
DM, HTN, CAD s/p MI ([**2125**]), ?coagulation d/o

Social History:
Reports [**1-15**] pack per day cigarettes, multiple
beers per day, denies illicit drug use.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Physical Exam:  98.9 98 105/35 16 100
GEN: A&O, NAD
HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist
CV: RRR, No M/G/R
PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R
ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender abdomen, erythematous and
edematous scrotum with 4x4cm necrotic area on underside, tender

Ext: No LE edema, LE warm and well perfused


Pertinent Results:
[**2135-8-20**] CT abdomen/pelvis: Extensive subcutaneous emphysema and
gas seen within the scrotal sac with associated inflammatory
changes extending along the left perineum that is concerning for
an infectious process, and with given history of diabetes, is
most compatible with Fournier's gangrene. No associated abnormal
fluid collections. There is no extension to involve the rectum.

[**8-21**] Echo:  Mildly depressed left ventricular systolic funciton.
Mild mitral regurgitation.

[**8-23**] Echo: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2135-8-21**], left ventricular function appears similar to slightly
worse although views are suboptimal for comparison. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation is now detected.

IMAGING:
[**8-20**] CT Abd/pelvis: Gas in scrotal sac concerning for Fournier's
sac, with no perirectal extension. No adjacent fluid
collections.
[**8-20**] CXR: Faint opacity projecting over RML
[**8-21**] CXR: Persistent diffuse patchy b/l pulmonary opacities.
Slight
interval improvement in perihilar region.
[**8-21**] Echo: LVEF= 45-50%, 1+ MR
[**8-22**] CXR: diffuse b/l infiltrates
[**8-23**] CXR: stable
[**8-23**] Echo: EF 40%, Eccentric MR jet. 2+ MR. LV inflow pattern
c/w restrictive filling abn, with elevated LA pressure. 2+ TR.
Mild PA systolic HTN. Septal, apical, and inferior hypokinesis
[**8-24**] CXR: slightly improved B pulmonary infiltrates
[**8-25**] CXR: stable B pulm infiltrates
[**8-25**] RUQ U/S: official pending, thickened GB wall
[**8-26**] B/l asymmetrically distributed alveolar and interstitial
opacities improved, except worsening of airspace disease in LLL.

[**8-27**] CXR - B pulmonary infitrates, worsened, L pleural effusion

[**8-28**] CXR - worsened B pulmonary infiltrates
[**8-29**] CXR - severe diffuse pulmonary infiltrates
[**8-29**] CT torso - Extensive, diffuse and patchy opacities
involving all lung fields, c/w ARDS. Severe multifocal PNA
remains in the DDx. B/l pleural effusions, moderate on R, small
on L. Hyperdense filling in a non-distended GB, could represent
a sludge-filled GB or vicarious contrast extraction from prior
contrast study.
[**8-30**] CXR - Stable, diffuse b/l pulmonary opacifications persist.

[**8-30**] TTE - Preserved biventricular systolic function, mild-mod
MR, PCWP >18mmHg, compared to findings of prior study from [**8-23**],

was no evidence of
non-convulsive status epilepticus or subclinical seizures.
[**9-5**] CXR - 1. Diffuse bilateral opacities demonstrate no
significant change since prior exam. 2. Small left pleural

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the ACS service. The following hospital
course as dictated per the ACS resident:
On HD 1, the patient was taken to the OR for perineal
debridement and scrotectomy. He received 1 uPRBC and was
transferred to the SICU on propofol and neo. His IVF were held
as he appeared to have some pulmonary edema on CXR.  On HD2 he
was transfused 2 uPRBC for hct of 24.3. He remained tachycardic.
On HD 3, he had persistent SOB and increased work of breathing
and was intubated. CXR was suggestive of ARDS and he was
paralysed and started on the ARDS protocol. On HD 4 the FiO2 and
neo were weaned down.
[**8-24**]: He was taken to OR for diverting colostomy.  It was
determined that he did not require further debridement at this
time after evaluation in the OR
[**8-25**]: Ventilator weaning initiated; his Neo was RUQ U/S was
done, weaning vent, no resp effort on PS. albumin x1
w/decreasing uop. weaning neo. vigileo disconnected. TFs
started.
[**8-26**]: tx 1u prbcs. decreasing uop. Acidotic on MMV- switched to
PCV o/n
[**8-27**]: fever, re-cultured, hypoxic, CXR worsened, Lasix 10mg x 2

[**8-29**]: CT torso given significant ileus - showed no
intraabdominal collections,
