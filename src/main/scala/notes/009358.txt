History of Present Illness:
86 yo M w/ bullous pemphigoid p/w sepsis of unclear etiology,
but likely from skin source. He was just at [**Hospital1 18**] and d/c on
[**7-26**] for coag neg staph bacteremia thought from skin given areas
of skin breakdown, and was treated with vancomycin with
improvement, and d/c to rehab on continued vanc (today [**7-31**] was
to be last day of tx). He also completed a 3-day course of cipro
for a positive U/A.
.

there to [**Hospital1 882**] initially. At [**Hospital1 882**], clinically pt was
determined to have a PE (no scans done) and he was treated with
heparin gtt empirically. He was also given levofloxacin. In [**Name (NI) **],
pt was hypothermic to 92F, SBP 70s, O2 sat 80 RA with obvious
respiratory distress. Though he was DNR/DNI, pt's son asked to
have pt intubated overnight. found to be oozing fluid from
various sites in CXR without infiltrate, U/A clean. A CVL/
sepsis catheter was placed and he received 5L NS, and max dose
of levophed which increased his SBP to 80s. Pt received cefepime
2g iv x 1. ED staff spoke with the family regarding the pt's
poor prognosis.

[**7-31**] CXR
AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:

A right-sided subclavian catheter is seen with tip overlying the
mid SVC. There has been interval placement of a right IJ
catheter with tip overlying the distal SVC. Endotracheal tube
extends below the diaphragm overlying the mid to proximal
stomach with side port seen below the GE junction. An
endotracheal tube is present with tip at the thoracic inlet in
standard position. There are bilateral moderate-sized pleural
effusions. Cannot rule out focal consolidations within the lower
lobes, particularly retrocardial.

IMPRESSION:

Endotracheal tube is in standard position. Bilateral
small-to-moderate sized pleural effusion with visceral fluid and
prominent pulmonary vasculature consistent with CHF.
.
[**7-31**] ECG
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse non-specific T wave flattening. Compared
to the previous
tracing of [**2191-7-12**] voltage criteria for left ventricular
hypertrophy are no
longer seen. Otherwise, no diagnostic changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
In ED, was put on Levophed gtt, was given cefipime 2 g IV, and
fentanyl 25 mg IV X 2.  He was intubated and a R IJ was placed
and he was started on the sepsis protocol.  In the ED, it was
not thought he had a PE.  He was hypotensive and was sent to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

A/P: 86 yo M w/ sepsis of unknown etiology, likely from skin
source given his clinical condition of massive skin denuded
areas, recent hospitalization for coag neg staph bacteremia. CXR
clear, U/A clean, and no h/o abd sxs/diarrhea/URI/ other focal
sxs.
.
Discussion with all family members, incl 3 sons, wife,
granddaughter, given max support on pressors and poor prognosis
will opt for comfort care.
- Morphine drip to comfort
- Versed if needed for comfort
- Withdraw pressors
- No abx further
- Was initially left intubated but was then extubated on the
request of the family.
- He was pronounced dead at 3:30 pm on [**2191-7-31**].
