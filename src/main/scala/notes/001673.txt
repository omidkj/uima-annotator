History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 year old male who has a history of atrial

to exercise 4 minutes 15 seconds on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol to a peak
heart rate of 96 and stopped due to chest pain and dyspnea. He
achieved 58% of maximum predicted heart rate, the EF was 64%.
Nuclear imaging demonstrated a reversible defect but the test
was thought to be suboptimal. He underwent an echo which showed
normal biventricular size and systolic function, no valve
abnormalities, but did have moderately severe left atrial
dilatation. He was told to take his last dose of coumadin on
[**2119-8-17**] and he was found to have a creatinine of 1.9 and is
being admitted for prehydration in preparation for cath
tomorrow.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.

review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. Patient does report DOE and chest tighntess with
exertion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77427**] was admitted for hydration and cardiac
catheterization. catheterization on [**8-23**] demonstrated
triple vessel disease with preserved left ventricular function.
He had venous stasis changes with mild cellulitis of the lower
legs (pretibial) and was kept in house for antibiotics and vein
mapping. Unasyn was begun for the cellulitis, which improved
somewhat preoperatively.

On [**8-25**] he went to the operating room where coronary
revascularization, a partial Maze and left atrial ligation was
performed (se operative note for details).He weaned from
cardiopulmonary bypass on Neo-Synephrine and Propofol easily. He
remained stable on transfer to the ICU and was extubated easily
on the day of surgery and pressors were weaned to off.

He was transferred to the floor on POD 2.  His CTs were removed
on POD 2 and pacing wires and right leg JP drain on POD3. He was
begun on diuretics, his Statin was resumed as was his Atenolol.
He reverted to AF at a controlled rate. Coumadin was resumed for
his rhythm.

At discharge wounds are healing well, the pretibial cellulitis
has resolved and his venous stasis changes are at baseline
according to the patient. He is ambulatory and is returning home
with VNA assistance.

Medications, instructions and follow up directions have been
discussed with him. His Coumadin will be controlled by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 23956**] as before hospitalization.(stopped [**8-28**])
