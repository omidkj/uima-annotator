HISTORY: Removal of chest tube, to assess for pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there has been
removal of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and left
chest tube. Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, and the right
IJ sheath remains. Right chest tube also has been removed. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Mild atelectatic changes persist at
the bases.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.
Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D
or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV
systolic function likely depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mitral
leaflets fail to fully coapt. Mild mitral annular calcification.
Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae. No MS. Eccentric MR
jet. Severe (4+) MR. Uninterpretable LV inflow pattern due to
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets do not fully coapt. There is posterior leaflet
restriction.. An eccentric jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
Post Bypass:
The patient is receiving an epinephrine infusion at 0.05
ucg/kg/min
LV systolic function is improved in the setting of inotropes
(LVEF~50%). There is a well seated ring prosthesis in the mitral
position. Mild MR (1+) is present. There is no evidence of
mitral stenosis. The study is otherwise unchanged from
prebypass.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
