FINDINGS: Single upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates
stable to minimally increased right small pleural effusion.
There is improved aeration of the right lower lung. Stable
opacity projecting over the right mid-thorax, likely
representing pleural fluid loculated within both the major and
minor fissures, which slightly limits evaluation for underlying
infiltrate. The heart is moderately enlarged, unchanged. There
is no left pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax.

Median sternotomy wires are noted. Osseous structures are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION:

1. Limited portable chest radiograph demonstrates stable to
minimally increased right pleural effusion.

2. Improved aeration of the right lower lung.

3. Moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo male w h/o biventricular CHF LVEF 35%, CAD s/p CABG, afib
who presents with CHF exacerbation and slow AF vs AF with 3rd
degree heart block.
.
Hospital course by problem
.
1 CHF
Patient presented in CHF exacerbation after food indiscretion.
Complicating failure was a bradyarrhythmia (discussed below).
Patient was diuresed and provided with a VVI pacer (actually a
BiV pacer with only a V pacing lead) to improve heart rate.
After acute exacerbation, he was restarted on his home
medications.  Lasix was converted to bumetanide for better PO
absorption and then sent home on po regiment of 2 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Spironalactone, beta blockade, ace-i, and digoxin were
restarted.  PT cleared patient for home and patient was
amenable.  He will follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology.  He will continue with home VNA and
home weight evaluation.  He will follow up in device clinic, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also instructed to more
diligently control his diet.
.
2 Bradycardia
Patient presented with complete heart block with a junctional
rhythm which exhibited alternating signs of both left and right
heart block.  A VVI pacer was implanted with good capture and
without acute complications of bleeding or infection.  He will
follow in the device clinic for follow up.
.
3 CAD
History of CAD s/p CABG.  Aspirin, statin, were continued.  Beta
blocker was restarted after acute exacerbation was cleared.  No
evidence of acute myocardial ischemia was identified during
hospitalization with negative cardiac enzymes.
.
4 UTI
Patient suffered from a VRE and MRSA UTI several weeks prior to
admission.  Again these organisms were isolated from urine
culture in setting of an inflammatory urine analysis.  He was
started on Linezolid and will continue outpatient for a total 12
day course.
.
5 Hypothyroidism
Home levothyroxine was continued.
.
6 ARF
Presented in ARF with 1 --> 1.3 bump in creatinine.  This
improved with diuresis and suspected improved forward flow.
Ace-I was restarted prior to discharge.
