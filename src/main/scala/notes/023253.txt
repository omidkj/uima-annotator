REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denies any cerebrovascular accident or
transient ischemic attack.  He has no bleeding problems, no
history of GI bleed or melena, no history of diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was awake, alert, and oriented, in
no apparent distress.  His heart rate was 90, blood pressure
140/72, respiratory rate 20.  Lungs:  Coarse bilaterally with
occasional wheezes.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with
distant heart sounds and no audible murmurs.  Abdomen:  Obese
with positive bowel sounds, soft and nontender.  Neck:
Supple, no carotid bruits.  Extremities:  Bilateral lower
extremities were cool.  His left foot had mild cyanosis.  He
had clubbing in his fingers with good capillary refill.
Pulses:  Dorsalis pedis pulses were 1+ on the right and
fleeting on the left.  His radial artery pulses were 2+
bilaterally.  His femoral pulses were 1+ on the left and
unable to assess on the right secondary to Angio-Seal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gas 7.43 with a PCO2 of 58
and a PO2 of 71, with 80% oxygen saturation.  His white count
was 18.1, hematocrit 53.4, platelet count 256,000, PT 14.9,
INR 1.5, PTT 26.9.  Sodium 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 88,
CO2 36, BUN 23, creatinine 1.0, blood glucose 114.  AST 32,
alkaline phosphatase 68, ALT 40, total bilirubin 1.0.  His
urinalysis showed positive nitrites and positive leukocytes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2180-8-10**] and
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 2 with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal #1.  The
surgery was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia.
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was 47 minutes and
cross-clamp time was 27 minutes.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the intensive care unit
in normal sinus rhythm on a propofol drip with two atrial and
two ventricular pacing wires and one mediastinal and one left
pleural chest tube.

The patient remained stable throughout the operative night,
maintaining a cardiac index of 2.2 to 2.8.  He did remain
intubated throughout the operative night, and only required
the addition of insulin drip.

By postoperative day number one he was extubated by the
middle of the day, and did well after that.  He otherwise did
well throughout postoperative day number one and on
postoperative day number two, in the morning, he went into
rapid atrial fibrillation with a rate of 150 or greater.  He
was given IV Lopressor and started on p.o. Lopressor and by
the evening had converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He was
kept in the intensive care unit to monitor his heart rhythm
and also for aggressive pulmonary toilet.

By postoperative day number three he continued to improve.
He did remain in normal sinus rhythm and remained in the
intensive care unit secondary to his size and need for
aggressive pulmonary toilet.

By postoperative day number four he was ready for transfer to
the floor and discharge planning was begun.  He worked with
physical therapy, although this was slightly limited by his
size early on, although by postoperative day number five he
was participating to the best of his ability.  It was felt at
this point that he would be ready for discharge to a
rehabilitation facility on postoperative day number six, and
will do well to receive more aggressive physical therapy
prior to his going home.

His discharge examination shows his lungs to have crackles at
the left base.  His heart is regular rate and rhythm.  His
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  It is obese and he
does have bowel sounds.  His extremities show 1+ edema
bilaterally.  His incisions are clean, dry and intact and his
sternum is stable.

His discharge laboratory studies include a white count of
13.4, hematocrit 37.9%, platelet count 247,000, sodium 137,
potassium 3.6, chloride 95, CO2 28, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8,
and a blood glucose of 106.

His chest x-ray showed small bilateral effusions and left
greater than right bibasilar atelectasis.  During his
hospital course he was on a heparin drip as DVT prophylaxis.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 27686**] instructions he is not to receive
Coumadin.
