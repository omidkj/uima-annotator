CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year old
African-American male with past medical history significant
for small bowel obstruction secondary to incarcerated
incisional hernia status post exploratory
laparotomy/reduction hernia/mesh repair [**2156-11-1**] who
presented to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2157-2-21**] with complaints of at least 24 hours of constant,
diffuse abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, nonbilious
vomiting. He reports that this episode is similar to the
small bowel obstruction that he suffered in [**2156-10-8**]
which was due to an incarcerated incisional hernia, but this
time, the pain is more intense. He does not feel a hernia. He
denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fever or chills. His last
BM was two days before. He has not passed any flatus within the
last 24 hours.

Past medical history is significant for hypertension, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, non insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus, osteoarthritis, gun shot to abdomen, small bowel
obstruction and ventral hernia.

Past surgical history includes:
1. Repair of ventral hernia with Alloderm in [**2156-10-8**].
2. Aortobifemoral bypass [**2155-8-9**].


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, glyburide
5 mg once daily, lisinopril 10 mg once daily, metoprolol 100
mg twice daily, metformin 500 mg twice daily, Celebrex 200 mg
once daily and Lipitor 20 mg once daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes at least one pack of
cigarettes per day. He reports a 40 pack year history. He
reports that he occasionally drinks alcohol and he denies
illicit drug use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  See HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals signs are 98.7, 98.7, 94,
163/89, 18, 95 percent on room air. General - the patient is
alert and oriented. He is in no acute distress. Chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart - regular rate and
rhythm without murmur. Abdomen is mildly distended, soft,
diffusely mildly tender to palpation without guarding, rebound
tenderness or masses noted. Rectal exam - normal tone, small
amount of stool in the vault, negative guaiac. Extremities -
distal neurovascular is intact.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient presented to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2157-2-21**] with complaints of
abdominal pain times 24 hours accompanied by nausea and
vomiting and without flatus. CT scan obtained in the
Emergency Department revealed a dilated jejunum with a clear
tapering, but not complete transition point, suggestive of small
bowel obstruction. The patient was admitted to the Surgery
Service. He was made NPO and an NG tube was placed. He was well-
hydrated with Lactated Ringers intravenous solution. Because the
patient was afebrile and in stable condition and his pain had
completely resolved with nasogastric decompression, it was
decided to observe him for resolution of his small bowel
obstruction.  He continued to remain stable throughout his
hospital course.  He felt well and passed gas and stool, however
he continued to belch.  Small bowel follow through revealed
high grade near complete obstruction.  Given his failure to
resolve the obstruction with conservative therapy, it was decided
to take Mr. [**Known lastname 3647**] to the Operating Room.

On hospital day No. 6, [**2157-2-26**], Mr. [**Known lastname 3647**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]
exploratory laparotomy with lysis of a single band adhesion
overlying one loop of his proximal jejunum.  The bowel was not
injured or ischemic under this band.  The area of the band
represented a clear transition point with proximal dilated bowel
and distal decompressed bowel.

At the completion of the operation after the lysis of the
adhesion, of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 3647**] suffered a hypoxic,
bradycardic, hypotensive event most likely secondary to a tension
pneumothorax secondary to the placement of a central venous line
that had been placed before the case due to his poor peripheral
access.  His probable pneumothorax was relieved initially by
placement of a 14 gauge angiocatheter in the right anterior chest
wall and then by the placement of a chest tube in the OR.  In
addition he received albuterol via the endotrachial tube
simultaneously. Postoperatively, he was transferred to the ICU in
stable condition. He would remain intubated in the ICU until
early postop day No. 1 at which time he self-extubated himself.
However, he did tolerate this extubation well. He remained
clinically stable in the ICU. His chest tube was removed on
postop day No. 2 after confirmation that there was no air leak
and no enlargement of the small right apical pneumothorax. After
the removal of his chest tube, chest x-ray revealed that there
was no enlargement of his small apical pneumothorax. Again,
he continued to remain clinically stable. He was kept NPO on
IV fluids and TPN. He was transferred to the floor on postop
day No. 4. He did have issues with oxygen desaturation when
he got up to walk. This continued to improve throughout his
postoperative course and likely is secondary to his heavy
smoking history. He was started on clear liquids on postop
day No. 5 which he tolerated very well. He began passing
flatus. On postop day No. 5, he continued to ambulate well
with the assistance of Physical Therapy. On postop day No. 6,
he was advanced to a regular diet which again he tolerated
very well. He continued to pass flatus. He continued to
remain pain-free. On postop day No. 7, Mr. [**Known lastname 3647**] is in good
condition, tolerating a regular diet, is pain-free,
ambulating easily and often. He was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3647**] is to take all
medications as prescribed. He is to not perform any heavy
lifting for at least six weeks. He is to not drive while
taking narcotic pain medications such as Percocet. If he
develops fever, chills, nausea or vomiting or increased
abdominal pain, he is to contact medical assistance
emergently.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Small bowel obstruction, complete.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101657**] within one week after discharge to schedule a follow-up
appointment. As well, please contact your primary care
physician within the first few days after discharge for
diabetes management, etc.

MAJOR SURGICAL AND INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Exploratory
laparotomy, lysis of adhesions.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet 5/325 mg one to two tablets
po q4-6h as needed for pain, Levaquin one tablet po q24h
times 7 days, Protonix 40 mg po once daily, metoprolol 100 mg
po twice daily, glyburide 15 mg po once daily, metformin 500
mg po bid, lisinopril 10 mg po once daily and Lipitor 20 mg
po once daily.
