Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5066**] is a 54 y/o M with a history of CAD s/p BMS to
LAD in [**2158**], HTN, DM2 who presented with sudden onset chest
pain/indigestion approximately 1 hour prior to presentation to
the ED. Patient reports burning chest pain that felt like
indigestion radiating to his left arm and up his neck. He was
watching television during the onset of his symptoms. He took
his home omeprazole with no relief. He called EMS and who noted
STE in anterolateral leads. He was brought to the ambulance and
had an episode of V-fib, which responded to one shock. He
reverted to NSR after and was loaded with 150mg of amiodarone.
He was also given a aspirin 81mg.
.
When he arrived to the ED initial vitals were  Pulse: 106 RR:
25, BP: 130/76, O2Sat: 95%, O2Flow: RA. A code STEMI was called
and he was taken to the cath lab which revealed significant LAD
disease primarily in-stent restenosis of his previous BMS and a
more distal occlusion that was felt to be the culprit lesion. In
the ED he was given aspirin 325mg, plavix 600mg, and started on
a heparin and amiodarone drip. EKG showed STE in V1-V4 and
pathological q waves in II, III and aVF.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient the patient was comfortable and
in no acute distress. He did note having continued indigestion
however he states that the sensation was different than what he
was experiencing previously. Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

**PTCA RESULTS
  LAD

PTCA COMMENTS:
Primary PCI was delayed because of severe torutosity in the
right upper
extremity and inability to seat the guide appropriately. We
initially
gained access via the right radial artery. However, because of
severe
tortuosity in the right axilla and because of a short ascending
aorta,
we were unable to engage the left main coronary artery. Because
of this,
we then gained access in the right femoral artery. A 6F sheath
was
inserted. Initial angiography revealed a 70% stenosis in the
proximal
LAD, a 70% stenosis in the proximal portion of the prior mid LAd
stents
and a 95% stenosis in the mid to distal edge of the prior mid
LAD
stents. We planned to treat all of these lesions with PTCA and
stenting.
Bivalirudin was administered for anticoagulation, and a
therapeutic ACT
was confirmed. A 6F XBLAD 3.5 guide provided adequate support. A

Prowater wire crossed the lesions with mdoerate difficulty.  We
then
predilated the distal lesion with a 2.25 x 12 mm Sprinter Legend
RX
balloon at 10 atm three times. This led to a short dissection
and no
reflow in the distal LAD. We therefore attempted to rapidly
deliver a
2.25 x 18 mm Resolute RX stent, but we were not able to deliver
due to
tortuosity. We therefore elected to change for a stiffer wire. A
2.25 x
15 mm Sprinter balloon was advanced to the distal LAD, and the
Prowater
wire was removed. A Choice PT Extra Support wire was advanced to
the
distal LAD, and the distal LAd was again predilated with the
2.25 x 15
mm Sprinter balloon at 12 atm. We were then able to deliver a
2.25 x 14
mm resolute stent to the distal lesion and deployed it at 13
atm. We
then delivered a 2.75 x 22 mm Resolute to the more proximal
portion of
the prior stents and deployed it at 16 atm. The proximal portion
of
the new stents was postdilated with a 3.0 x 15 mm NC Quantum
Apex MR
balloon at 16 atm. The mid portion of the newly deployed stents
was
postdilated with a 2.75 x 12 mm NC Quantum Apex balloon at 18
atm. We
then direct stented the more proximal LAD lesion with a 3.5 x 15
mm
Resolute stent at 16 atm. Final angiography revealed no residual

stenosis, no evidence of dissection and TIMI 3 flow. Right
femoral
angigoraphy revealed an arteriotomy site appropriate for
closure, and a
6F Perclose was deployed with adequate hemos
