History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with CAD who was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital
[**2127-12-1**] after MVA causing R. tibial fracture. He subsequently
underwent ORIF; post op he had increasing pain that was
difficult to control; as sa result of increased pain meds he
became sedated which was felt to have led to an aspiration
event; he was given narcan. Subsequently on [**12-5**] he had a
hypoxic event and a diagnosis of PE was made; which required
intubation. Since that time he has required AC ventilation with
requirements of FIO2 80%/PEEP 5. Of note, this hypoxic event was
felt to be extensive and patients neurologic status has not
improved since.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for rehab on the ventilation while
on heparin & today was transferred back to [**Last Name (un) 4199**] for
evaluation for Trach/PEG. He was noted to have BRBPR, a hct was
22 (down from 27). PTT>150. He was given 1U prbcs and per report
an EGD was done with no source of bleeding. The GI service felt
pt would benefit from arteriogram with vasopressin
adminstration; he was given peripheral vasopressin he was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GIB plus
evaluation for trach/peg.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old woman with past medical history of morbid obesity
(s/p gastric lap banding), hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
presenting with acute respiratory distress and malignant
hypertension.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was initially intubated at
an OSH following respiratory failure in the setting of increased
sedation and PE.  He was intubated and remained intubated upon
transfer to rehab.  He was referred for trach/PEG, but while
undergoing the procedure he was found to have a GI bleed and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  On arrive the patient with respiratory
failure likely multifactorial including PE, HAP/aspiration and
volume overload. His prior sputum cultures had grown
Enterobacter aerogenes and initially treated with Cefepime.
However, his abx were changed to vancomycin/zosyn after repeat
CXR [**12-11**] showed new left sided infiltrate.  He completed a 14
day course of Vancomycin/Zosyn on [**2127-12-26**].  Additionally, given
his pulmonary edema he was diuresed with IV lasix.  He was also
restarted on his heparin gtt for his prior PE, LENI were
negative for DVT. The patient underwent trach and PEG on
[**2127-12-26**] and weaned to PS support.  The trach should not be
changed for 10 days after placement and if he needed to be
re-intubated it should be from above.   The patient was on MMV
ventilation on discharge TV 500, RR 6, FiO2 50%, PEEP 8 PSV 12

#. Mental Status:  The patient with limited mental status after
his accident and respiratory arrest.  He was AAOx3 and fully
functional prior to his accident.  He was evaluated by neurology
and underwent an EEG that showed some questional delta activity
concerning for seizure.  He was started on phenytoin per neuro.
He also underwent an MRI that did not show evidence of anoxic
brain injury.  The etiology of his mental status is likely
metabolic encephalopathy, but his prognosis is unclear.  The
plan is to lighten sedation and assess neurologic status.  Per
the wife [**Name (NI) 382**] if he does not have meaningful recovery and
ventilator dependent then will likely be transitioned to comfort
care.  He will continue Dilantin 100mg TID and levels should be
checked.

#Hypotension- Patient initially hypotensive on arrival and on
vasopressin.  He was changed over the levophed and it was
sucessfully weaned off on [**12-26**].  The patient's hypotension was
likely multifactorial including infectious (pneumonia), GIB and
sedation.

#LGIB- The patient was noted to have bright red blood per rectum
at rehab while on heparin gtt.  His heparin gtt was held and
after evaluation at the OSH he was noted to have 7pt Hct drop
and received 1U prbcs. Per report, he had EGD and did not find a
source of bleeding.  On arrive the the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU he was noted
to have brown stool that was guaiac positive, but no further
episodes of BRBPR.  The patient was transfused a total of 3U
pRBC during his admssion, the most recent on [**12-24**].  Given that
the patient did not have any further episodes of bleeding he was
restarted on his heparin gtt without further evidence of
bleeding.  He was also evaluated by GI and recommended
outpatient colonoscopy and follow-up given no evidence of acute
bleeding.

#LV Thrombus/PE: Pt with history of LV thrombus previously on
coumadin.  A repeat TTE did not show evidence of LV thrombus.
He was transitioned to lovenox on discharge and will need to be
started on coumadin.

#H/o CAD s/p cardiac arrest [**2114**]: The pateint was continued on
his home sotolol.  His aspirin was held given his history of GI
bleed.

#DM: The patient was covered with an insulin sliding scale
