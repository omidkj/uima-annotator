HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51 year old
alcoholic man with a history of alcoholic pancreatitis, who
recently presented to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital on [**9-29**] with abdominal
pain, increased abdominal girth and jaundice.  The patient
was found to have an obstructive mass in the duodenum, left
inguinal lymphadenopathy, ascites, pancreatitis and a
bilirubin of 14.4.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrogram
cholangiopancreatography on [**10-7**] with failure to cannulate
ampulla resulting in respiratory failure during procedure and
intubation.  The patient was found to have bilateral
infiltrates and pulmonary effusions, thought to have adult
respiratory distress syndrome, required minimal ventilatory
settings, though.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin,
Flagyl, Zosyn for concern of hospital acquired pneumonia.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for percutaneous attempt at biliary drain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
2.  Alcoholism.
3.  Alcoholic pancreatitis.  Recently diagnosed with
obstructive jaundice and duodenal mass.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  No medications at home.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Zosyn 3.375 four times a day.
2.  Diprivan 20 mics per kg per minute.
3.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
4.  Levofloxacin 500 q. day.
5.  Flagyl 500 mg three times a day.
6.  Versed GTTS.
7.  Ipratropium.
8.  Albuterol.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Homeless; two pack a day smoker.  Denies
alcohol consumption in the past two months.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In evaluation on arrival, he was found
to have a temperature spike of 104.5 F.; temperature on the
Medical Intensive Care Unit was 100.0 F.; 88 pulse; 111/65
blood pressure; MAP 82; respiratory rate 20; 97% on
ventilation.  In no acute distress, intubated and sedated.
Pupils equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Communications through use of hands.  Lung sounds are coarse
bilaterally, diffuse expiratory and inspiratory wheeze.
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen soft, mildly distended, positive biliary drain in
right upper quadrant; no erythema.  Positive for ascites and
shifting dullness, left inguinal mass with post surgical scar
exudates.  Chronic venous stasis changes in lower legs
bilaterally.  Plus two dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.
Two plus pitting edema.  Cranial nerves difficult to assess
secondary to sedation.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count on admission 13.3,
hematocrit 41, bilirubin 3.1, albumin 2.6, AST 75.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for work-up of obstructive jaundice and
history of alcoholic pancreatitis.

Endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography was consulted
with the recommendation of PTC.  Sections of the duodenum
were obtained that showed mucosal eroding ulcerations with
active inflammation; biopsy was obtained later which showed
chronic inflammatory change and fibrosis; no evidence of
malignancy.  Common bile duct brushings negative for
malignancy as well.

Ca-19 was found to be 77; CEA 6.9.

Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast was obtained
showing bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
ascites with hepatobiliary dilatation, presumed pancreatitis,
no pancreas masses seen although small probably cystic area
in the head of the pancreas seen.  There are additional left
inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Interventional Radiology placed bilateral biliary drains,
internal exiting with decompression of biliary ductal system.
Per IR, long area of stricture of the common bile duct, mild
dilatation of the right and left intrahepatic ducts, and a
biopsy was obtained of the lower common bile duct which again
was negative for malignancy, positive for chronic
inflammation changes.

The patient's bilirubin continued to be trending down and
right internal hepatic drain was internalized on [**2115-10-21**].
The patient began tolerating sips of clear and p.o. intake
with normal bowel movements.  Liver enzymes remained flat.
Concern for portal vein thrombus as seen on CT scan.  Repeat
right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed normal flow, no
evidence of complete obstruction, although presence of
thrombus could not be eliminated via this modality.

Ascites were sent for analysis and cytology was pending at
time of dictation.

2.  ONCOLOGY:  Preliminary results from lymph node obtained
from outside hospital was negative for malignancy.  Lymph
node showed reactive vascular transformation.  Surgery was
consulted and repeat biopsy was obtained; preliminary results
show that it is positive for LCA, CD20 strong positive as
well as 100% myotic index, is an indication of a high grade B
cell lymphoma histologically, although clinically, the
patient does not appear to be succumbing to a high grade
lymphoma process.  The patient, at this time, declined
further staging work-up and would recommend PET CT scan of
the chest to delineate the presence or absence of mediastinal
nodes.  CT scan of the abdomen done for obstructive jaundice
was negative for intraperitoneal nodes.

3.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient was transferred after
intubation from the endoscopic retrogram
cholangiopancreatography.  He was subsequently weaned from
the ventilator and extubated on hospital day three, requiring
nebulizers and respiratory toilet therapy.  Subsequently he
was breathing 98% on room air without sequelae.  He has small
bilateral effusions which were tapped.  Cytology and
chemistries are pending at this time of dictation.  Currently
he is without evidence of pneumonia.  He was continued on
course of Levofloxacin.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Sputum, bile gram stain negative,
blood cultures negative to date.  Outside hospital reported
positive ventilator related pneumonia, continued on broad
spectrum antibiotics and defeversced on hospital day five
without temperature spikes.  Unasyn and Bactrim were
discontinued.  The patient remained on Vancomycin and Zosyn
to protect for SBP.  Currently afebrile without leukocytosis.
HIV serology is negative.  Hepatology viral cultures pending
at time of dictation.

5.  DERMATOLOGIC:   The patient was found to have likely
Condyloma on penis with areas around genitalia consistent
with herpes simplex one and two, DFA sent.  Pending at time
of dictation.  The patient continued on Famvir 300 three
times a day to be discontinued on [**10-26**].

6.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient switched over to an
American Diabetic Association diet, tolerating p.o. well,
coverage with regular insulin sliding scale with good control
of blood sugar.

7.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on subcutaneous
heparin and continued ambulation per recommendations of
Physical Therapy.

DISPOSITION:   The patient very uncooperative to nursing
staff and recommendations of further work-up for positive
lymph node biopsy.  Declining studies for further evaluation
and management.  Per request, would like to return to [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital for continuation of care and possible outpatient
management of oncologic issues.

Would recommend staging CT scan, PET preferably.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Famvir 500 p.o. three times a day to be continued until
[**2115-10-26**].
2.  Lactulose 30 ml p.o. three times a day.  Hold for
stooling.
3.  Zosyn 4.5 intravenous q. eight.
4.  Vancomycin 1.5 grams intravenous q. 12.
5.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
6.  Tylenol p.r.n.
7.  Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers q. four two puffs.
8.  Heparin 5000 units q. eight subcutaneously.

1.  Follow-up acute transfer to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 8641**],
[**Location (un) 3844**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient is transferred in Fair
condition.
