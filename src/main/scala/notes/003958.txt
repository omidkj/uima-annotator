Pertinent Results:
[**2121-5-20**] ECHO: Pre-bypass: The left atrium and right atrium are
normal in cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal(LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is bicuspid.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial
effusion. Post-bypass: The patient is receiving no inotropic
support post-CPB. There is a well-seated bileaflet mechanical
prosthesis in the aortic position with good leaflet excursion.
There are two small transvalvular regurgitant jets consistent
with washing jets. There is no paravalvular regurgitation. The
mean transvalvular gradient is 5 mm Hg. Biventricular systolic
function is preserved and all other findings are consistent with
pre-bypass findings. The aorta is intact post-decannulation. All
findings discussed with the surgeon intraoperatively.

[**2121-5-21**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, all
monitoring and support devices have been removed, except for the
right-sided jugular vein catheter. There is no visible
pneumothorax. Unchanged appearance of the lung parenchyma,
unchanged minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. No pleural
effusions. No overhydration, no pneumonia. Normal size of the
cardiac silhouette.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 85213**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-5-20**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was taken directly
to the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement using a 21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Valve. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next several hours,
she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On
postoperative day two, she transferred to the step down unit for
further recovery. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for
her aortic valve. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires
were removed per protocol. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. She continued to improve will awaiting INR to be in
therapeutic range (2.5-3.5). On post-op day four she appeared
suitable for discharge home with VNA services and the
appropriate medications and follow-up appointments. She was
cleared for discharge by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Coumadin with
be followed by PCP [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1494**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1492**] with goal INR 2.5-3.5.
