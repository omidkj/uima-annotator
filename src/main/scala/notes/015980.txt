Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
Found down, hypotensive in the ED


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80 yo man with history of neuroendocrine tumor s/p colostomy and
chemotherapy, paroximal atrial fibrillation on coumadin who
presents being found down by wife. [**Name (NI) **] had been feeling weak for
4 days. Then today, he was taking his sock off when he slipped
off the bed and fell to floor. His wife reports that he did not
hit his head.  He was unable to crawl to phone to call 911. His
wife arrived after approximately 3 hours and called EMS. BP
initially 140/90.
.
In the ED: VS 102.4, 150/88, HR 94, RR16, 98% RA, EKG no change
per ED (not avail). Labs: lactate 1.0, Creatinine, Hct at
baseline. WBC 9.7, up from baseline 4.0. U/A neg and CXR w ? RLL
infiltrate per ED res. Trop 0.04 (baseline). Cultures and flu
test drawn. He received cipro, flagyl, 1gm tylenol. Then SBP
dropped to 80s. Given 3L IVF and added ceftriaxone 2gm IV once.
SBP up to 100 (baseline 150).
.
Currently, reports persistent bilateral proximal upper extremity
weakness x 1-2 weeks.  He did have a fall 2 weeks prior and
caught himself with his arms.  Did not note increased pain
immediately, but in the days following.  Has been using arms
less, which could explain some deconditioning, but he thinks
there may be an additional cause. He reports good compliance
with medications. No head pain, no meningismus, no photophobia.
POS rhinorrhea but no cough, URI-like sx.  No chest pain, sob,
palpitations, abd pain, fevers. No increased diarrhea or
constipation. POS chills x1-2 weeks. POS upper ex prox weakness
x1-2 weeks. No dysuria.

Past Medical History:
1. Prostate cancer status post definitive radiation treatment
from [**1-/2113**] to 05/[**2112**]. This treatment was delivered under the
care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 656**] here at [**Hospital1 18**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] of urology.
2. Cardiomyopathy, echo [**12-3**]: EF 60%.
3. Atrial fibrillation, s/p pacemaker, on coumadin

5. Diverticular disease status post a diverticular stricture
status post low anterior resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**]
6. Neuroendocrine rectal cancer dx [**2115-6-29**]. per heme/onc
notes: "s/p two cycles of cisplatin and etoposide following his
surgery prior to which he had also received the same regimen
with a good response. Recently, he was found on a followup CT
scan to have what appeared to be a recurrence of his disease.
However, the nature of this recurrence was not clear, and he
recently underwent a biopsy of a pelvic mass which does not show
any evidence of malignancy. In addition, his PSA has been rising
as well which in [**1-/2116**] was 3.5 and then in [**4-/2116**] was 5.3 and
most recently on [**2116-5-29**] was 6.1."


Social History:
Married, 5 children, lives in [**Location **]. Retired police
commander.  Quit tobacco 30yrs ago. No current EtOH.


Family History:
Family history is unremarkable for colorectal cancer.  His
father had esophageal cancer but was a heavy smoker.  His
paternal aunt had stomach cancer.

[**2116-11-19**] 9:34 AM  CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C
CHEST: Note is made of goiter with calcification and multiple
small nodules, unchanged since prior study. There is significant
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. The lymph node in
pretracheal measures 12 mm in short axis, and the right hilar
node measures 22 mm in short axis, and subcarinal node measures
42 x 26 mm. These lymph nodes are overall slightly increased in
size since prior study. The heart is moderately enlarged, and
there is dense calcification of the coronary arteries. There is
small bilateral pleural effusion, new since prior study.
Calcified pleural plaque is again noted, suggestive of prior
asbestos exposure. There is a large hiatal hernia. In the lung
window, note is made of new patchy consolidation in the right
lower lobe, associated with interlobular septal thickening and
faint ground-glass opacities, suspicious for pneumonia or
aspiration/aspiration pneumonia or hemorrhage if the patient has
hemoptysis. There are several patchy nodules without
calcification measuring up to 8 mm in the right upper lobe,
overall unchanged since prior study. No endobronchial lesion is
noted.

ABDOMEN: There are multiple hypoattenuating foci in the liver as
noted on the prior study, likely representing cysts. There are
several other ill-defined hypoattenuating foci, one in segment
IV and the other in segment VI, for which metastasis cannot be
totally excluded. However the evaluation for these liver lesions
is limited on this single-phase study. There is no intrahepatic
ductal dilatation. Portal vein is patent. Spleen is normal.
Again note is made of enlarged left adrenal gland likely
representing adenoma. Right adrenal gland is within normal
limits. Pancreas is atrophic, with prominent main pancreatic
duct measuring up to 3 mm, unchanged since prior study. CBD
measures 9 mm. Gallbladder is contracted without evidence of
calcification. There is no ascites or fluid collection. There is
no significant lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. There are
multiple hypoattenuating foci in the kidneys, likely
representing cysts, without hydronephrosis or suspiciously
enhancing mass. The visualized portions of large and small
intestines are within normal limits with ileostomy. There is a
2.0 cm enhancing nodule in the right subcutaneous tissues in the
back at the level of L2, representing increased metastasis.

PELVIS: Again note is made of large heterogeneous masses lateral
to the right psoas muscle measuring 88 x 69 mm, and other
mesenteric metastasis on the left measuring 39 x 37 mm (series
3: image 89), increased in size since prior study. There is no
free fluid or significant lymphadenopathy. There are tiny
bladder diverticula with air in the diverticula and in the
urinary bladder.

Degenerative changes of thoracolumbar spine are again noted.
There is severe scoliosis. Again note is made of thickened
trabecula and cortex in the right ilium and sacrum, as seen
since [**2112**], consistent with Paget disease. In the region of
Paget disease, it is difficult to exclude new metastasis,
however, otherwise, no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion is
noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slight increase in size of mediastinal and hilar
lymphadenopathy as well as increase in size of intraperitoneal
metastatic masses. 2.0-cm subcutaneous nodule in the post
