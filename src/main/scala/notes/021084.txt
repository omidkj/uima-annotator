Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular Central Line Placement
Right Internal Jugular temporary dialysis catheter placement
Right Groin Tunneled Dialysis Catheter Placement


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 71 y/o male with htn, dm2, cad s/p cabg, chf, pvd, esrd
on hd with a recent admission for mrsa hd-line sepsis who
presents from hd with fever, chills, and altered mental status.
He'd been in his usual state of health the night prior to
admission, but at dialysis was noted to have chills; he was
subsequently noted to be febrile though not hypotensive.  The HD
team reported purulent drainage from the HD cath site (right
subclavian placed at the last admission - [**8-1**] to [**8-11**], during
which his MRSA infected left subclavian was removed).  He has
been on vancomycin since this admission, with plans for a 4 week
total course due to end in 1 week.  He was also notably started
on coumadin at the nursing home for a L IJ clot, however it is
unclear how they obtained this information.
.
In the ED, he was febrile to 102.3, bp 135/49, hr 122, rr 16,
and O2 sat 97% on ra.  He was fluid resuscitated with 2 liters
of NS, a right IJ was placed, and he was given vancomycin,
cefepime, and gentamicin.  He complained of some developing sore
throat.

Past Medical History:

2)DM2
3)Coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**2133**]; stress in [**2142**] with
severe, fixed perfusion defect in the inferior wall; moderate

wall; and fixed left ventricular enlargement with decreased
ejection fraction of 18%.
4)CHF with EF 30% on [**2144**] TTE, E/A 0.6
5)PVD s/p multiple amputations
6)H/O SVT
7)ESRD on HD
8)CVA: Right paramedian pontine hemorrhage [**2142**]
9)Chronic anemia, labs consistent with ACD

Pertinent Results:
ECG: NSR, lateral mild ST-depr, no significant change from prior

CXR: No infiltr, effusion, or chf

[**2145-8-24**] - L UE US:  Left internal jugular and subclavian vein
deep vein thrombosis.

[**2145-8-27**] - Near occlusive thrombus in the right internal jugular
vein, which has increased since the previous exam.  These
findings were relayed to the clinical service on [**2145-8-27**].  The
remainder of the examination is
unremarkable.

CXR [**8-28**]: The lateral aspect of the left lung and left
costophrenic angle are not included on this radiograph. The
patient is status post median sternotomy, and there is
fragmentation of the superior-most wire. The right IJ catheter
terminates within the lower SVC. There is no evidence for
pneumothorax. There is patchy opacity overlying the right lower
lung zone, which may relate to developing
atelectasis/consolidation.

[**8-30**] TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction included inferior akinesis, anterior hypokinesis,
and anteroseptal and inferoseptal hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderate to severely depressed.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Sepsis -- Patient was started on broad spectrum abx with
vancomycin and ceftazidime. BP remained stable.  He did not
require pressors.  His Lactic acid trended down from 5.  Source
of infection thought to be right subclavian HD catheter vs b/l
internal jugular and subclavian thrombosis (septic
thrombophlebitis).  He had been treated with vanco at HD since
his last admission for MRSA bacteremia. He had a TEE which was
negative for vegetations during his last admission.  He received
Linezolid and Ceftaz initially for concern for Pseudomonas and
VRE.  ID was consulted and felt the cause of his sepsis was
likely a persistent MRSA infection and not VRE.  He was
continued on  Vanco at HD.  He will complete a 6 week course to
end on [**10-5**].  He will have follow-up  b/l UE U/S.  He will be
seen in the [**Hospital **] Clinic to determine the need for further
treatment at that time.

His Urine and blood cultures were w/o growth at the time of
discharge.  A right groin tunneled dialysis catheter was placed
on [**8-31**] and his temporary Right IJ line was removed.  A repeat
TEE on [**8-30**] was negative for vegetations.

# NSVT: He had two 20 beat runs of VT while off his B-B. They
did not recur once his B-B was restarted and his Mg was
aggressively repleted.  Also, his BB was increased. Consider EP
consult for AICD placement as an outpatient once his infection
and thromboses have resolved.

# Right and left IJ venous thrombus and left subcalvian venous
thrombus.
