Chief Complaint:
hematuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cystoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 89 yo F with a PMHx of recently diagnosed bladder mass
suspicious for TCC, dementia (possibly [**Last Name (un) 56911**] body), DMII, h/o
CVA and possibly seizures who p/f [**Hospital3 **] with complaints
of worsening hematuria.
.
The patient got her labs drawn at [**Last Name (un) **] hosue and her Hct was
found to be down to 25.3 from 29.3 .  She was also reported to
be complaining of worsening weakness, dizziness and decreased po
intake.  She was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
There her VS were stable and a 3 way foley was placed.  Urology
saw the patient and advised continued flushing and medicine
admission.  The patient was recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] a
cystoscopy was done on [**2184-1-16**] which showed an anterolateral and
posterior wall tumor.  Urine cytology was suspicious for
urotherlial dysplasia.  A CT was also done as part of that work
up which revealed two bladder masses concerning for TCC.  The
patient was admitted for w/u for her ARF and hematuria.
.
On the floor, the patient c/o constipation.  Otherwise she
denies complaints.

IMAGING:
[**2184-3-6**] CT
 Multidetector CT imaging of the chest was performed without
intravenous contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats were
generated and
reviewed.
CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The major airways
are patent to subsegmental levels bilaterally. Multiple round
soft tissue nodules are seen in both lungs, the largest at the
junction of the left lower lobe and lingula measuring 2.3 x 2.0
cm. The pleural-based mass in the right upper lobe measures 1.6
x 0.9 cm (3:21). There is moderate-sized simple right pleural
effusion with compressive atelectasis of a major portion of the
right lower lobe. There is no left pleural effusion. Few
enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the paratracheal, prevascular,
subcarinal and hilar regions, with the largest lymph node in the
prevascular region measuring 13 mm (2:17). Few of thesenodes are
calcified, suggestive of prior granulomatous disease.
The imaged portion of the heart is unremarkable, except for
extensive coronary arterial calcification. There is no
pericardial effusion. No significant mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary adenopathy is seen. The main and lobar pulmonary
arteries are dilated, with the main pulmonary artery measuring
3.2 cm, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The
thoracic aorta has moderate atherosclerotic calcification
without aneurysmal dilation. This study is not tailored for
evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic organs, within this
limitation, imaged portion of the liver and spleen are
unremarkable.

BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection
or
malignancy are detected. Mild degenerative changes are seen in
the thoracic
spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. In this patient with clinical concern for bladder cancer,
multiple
pulmonary nodules are concerning for metastatic disease. Few
mostly calcified
mediastinal lymph nodes relate to prior granulomatous disease.
2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Moderate-sized simple right pleural effusion.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2184-3-11**] at 11:32:35 AM      FINAL

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is considerable beat-to-beat variability of
the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular
rhythm/premature beats. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated due to the
technically suboptimal nature of this study). There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: severe, chronic or acute-on-chroni
