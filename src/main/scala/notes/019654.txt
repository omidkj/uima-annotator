Date of Birth:   [**2066-1-3**]       Sex:  F

Service: Orthopedic Surgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old
woman who had a head-on motor vehicle crash with reported 15
to 20 minute extrication and vomiting at the scene with GCS
of 7 and initial blood pressure of 50 with a distended
abdomen.  She was intubated in the field.  Her blood pressure

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Colostomy with oversewn rectum.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initially she was intubated and
sedated.  Heart was regular.  Lungs bilateral breath sounds
which were clear.  Abdomen was soft, but distended.  Chest
had abrasions, but no crepitus.  Back had no deformities.
reactive 3 to 2 bilaterally.  No motor or sensory deficits
noted.  On the right side there was an open ankle fracture,
bilateral deep knee lacerations with exposed bone and
periosteum.  Initial pulses were bilateral DP and PT.  Rectum
was oversewn and no exam was done.  There was some blood in
the perineum that looked like it was possibly from a vaginal
remnant.

LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation CBC white count 8.8,
hematocrit 31.6, platelets 197.  Chemistry sodium 139, K 3.7,
chloride 109, bicarb 15, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9, glucose 184.
Negative UA.  Amylase 150, lactate 7.4.  ABG was 7.22, 27,
242, 12, -15.  Alcohol level was 166, otherwise tox screen
was negative.  Chest x-ray did not show pneumo, but did show
multiple rib fractures on the right.  Pelvis x-ray was
negative.  CT of her head was negative.  CT of her abdomen
showed a grade 4 liver laceration of the right lobe with some
free blood in the pelvis.  CT of the C-spine was negative.
CT of the chest showed bilateral rib fractures, multiple
atelectasis, scant contusion on the right with normal
mediastinum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the intensive
care unit with active resuscitation.  Orthopaedics was
called.  Serial hematocrits were checked along with coags and
platelets.  She was continued on vent support.  Her course
was significant for some washout of the open fractures on
[**12-21**], hospital day two, with subsequent repair of the ankle
fractures with open reduction and internal fixation.  She was
also noted to have a left femur fracture which was repaired
on [**12-31**] with ORIF.  She did receive blood transfusions
to keep her hematocrit stable.  She did end up having narrow
complex tachycardia which was found to be sinus tachycardia.
Cardiac echo was done which did not show any tamponade.  At
that time another chest x-ray was obtained and showed
bilateral pneumothoraces, so she had bilateral chest tubes
placed.  These were subsequently discontinued without
problems.

She continued to have some altered mental status.  Initial
GCS was 7.  Her vent dependence was complicated by Serratia
pneumonia along with yeast in her sputum.  She was treated
with broad spectrum antibiotics and antifungals from [**12-27**]
until [**1-6**], so she had a full course of antibiotics.
She was extubated successfully on [**2120-1-4**] and has not
had any respiratory difficulties since then.  Her main issue
remains her orthopaedic injuries as a complication of her
motor vehicle crash.  Now that all her injuries are repaired,
she is nonweight bearing currently and will need to follow up
in two weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of orthopaedics.  She has been seen
by O.T. and P.T. and rehab and is scheduled to go to rehab
possibly today, [**1-8**], or tomorrow, [**1-9**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Head-on motor vehicle crash on [**12-20**] with alcohol on
board.
2.  Rib fractures.
3.  Grade 4 liver laceration.
4.  Open right ankle and patella fractures.
5.  Left femur fracture.
6.  Bilateral pneumothoraces status post chest tube placement
and discontinued.
7.  Narrow complex tachycardia.
8.  Status post ankle ORIF.
9.  Altered mental status.
10. Vent dependence.
11. Serratia pneumonia treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics completely.
12. History of colostomy with oversewn rectum.

She currently is tolerating a house diet.  She is assist out
of bed to chair.  Current meds include Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
q.d., Percocet one to two tabs p.o. q.four to six hours

subcu heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Tylenol p.r.n., nystatin
oral suspension p.r.n., Ambien 5 p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n.  She does
not have any IV fluids.  She is on a house diet.

FOLLOWUP:  Followup is in two weeks in orthopaedic clinic,
two weeks in trauma clinic.  She should get physical therapy
at the nursing facility.  She should continue on subcu
heparin until she is able to be mobile.  The duration of
nonweight bearing status will be decided at followup with
orthopaedics.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
