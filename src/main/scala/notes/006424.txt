Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2171-3-27**] endotracheal intubation
[**2171-3-27**] PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
53M with recent intoxication who presented s/p fall with 30
minutes of PEA arrest of unclear etiology.
.
Reportedly, patient fell down 4 stairs and his neck became
wedged face down between iron raling and fence pole.  He was
lifted over this. On arrival patient was noted to be weithout
pulse and in PEA arrest.  PIV access was obtained, ETT tube was
inserted with visualization of cords.  Pupils were noted to be
pinpoint and 2mg narcan was admistered. Pt was without pulse for
30 minutes before spontaneous regain of circulation (without
ACLS medications). CPR was discontinued.

En route, patient continued to be unresponsive.  He was given 2
PIV,Narcan withotu improvement of MS.  On arrival to OSH,
patient was in SR, BP 139/85, HR 87, 96% ventilator.

On arrival to the OSH, patient was intubated, completely
unresponsive and flaccid with no reflexes in lower extremities.
He was started on sedation with versed and fentanyl,which were
the only medications he received prior to transfer to the MICU.
He was started on hypothermic protocol.   He was med flighted
here but was unable to continue therapeutic hypothermia on
transfer.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was evaluated with CT head,neck and
torso.  Trauma evaluation included imaging of head, neck, and
torso.
Imaging of his head neck and torso were unrevealing. [**Month (only) 116**] have
broken his nose a bit.

Upon return from CT resumed on hypothermic protocol, T 33.5C.
ETOH level of 292. Pt was bolused fentanyl and vecuronium.  In
the ED he was biting down on the tube, but rest of his body was
paralyzed.  Was started on propofol which relaxed pt. HR and BP
have been within normal limits.  FAST echocardiography showed
globably working heart but not a great pump.  C collar is stll
on, unable to remove given lack of mental status.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt was intubated, unarousable.  Family
unable to be contact[**Name (NI) **].

CT HEAD NECK [**3-26**]:
FINDINGS: The patient is intubated with the tip of the
ventilation tube above
the carina. The orogastric tube is coiled within the oropharynx
and does not
reach to the stomach.
.
CT HEAD: The cerebral sulci, ventricles, and extra-axial
CSF-containing
spaces have normal size and configuration. There is no shift of
the midline
structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation of the brain
parenchyma is
well preserved, and there is no CT evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or
acute ischemic infarct.

No fractures are identified. Mucosal thickening is involving the
bilateral
ethmoid and right maxillary sinus.
.
CTA HEAD: The intracranial internal carotid, vertebrobasilar and
anterior,
middle and posterior cerebral arteries are patent with normal
contrast
enhancement and branching pattern. There is no evidence of
stenosis,
occlusion, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation.
.
CTA OF THE NECK: The origins of the common carotid and vertebral
arteries are
patent without significant stenosis. The common, internal and
external
carotid arteries are normal in appearance. There is no evidence
of
hemodynamically significant stenosis or dissection. The cervical
portions of
the vertebral arteries likewise demonstrate normal contrast
opacification.

Note is made of atelectasis involving the bilateral lung apices.


IMPRESSION:
1. Normal CT of the head, specifically without evidence of
post-traumatic
hemorrhage or skull fracture.

2. Normal CTA of the head and neck.

3. Incidental note of coiled orogastric tube in the oro- and
hypopharynx.
Repositioning is recommended
.
TTE [**3-27**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a prominent anterior fat pad with a very small
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
.
CT HEAD [**3-30**]:
1. No acute intracranial pathology. A small hypodense focus in
the right
internal capsule- uncertain chronicity. If there is concern for
acute
infarction, an MRI can be performed if not CI.

2. Pansinus opacification ?(likely relates to the endotracheal
intubation).

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
CXR [**3-31**]:
1. Change in position of PICC line, which may be accentuated by
lordotic
positioning. The tip now overlies the upper right atrium.

2. Left lo
