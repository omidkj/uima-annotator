History of Present Illness:
68M with a history of afib s/p ablation on [**2129-1-14**], diabetes
type II, HTN, OSA refusing CPAP, hiatal hernia, and alcohol
abuse admitted for fall, ICH, and temporal bone fracture who
developed acute hypoxia on the floor initially and was found to
have aspiration PNA and then went into alcohol withdrawal. In
brief, he was at a bar and fell in the parking lot due to a
combination of intoxication and ice. He hit his head and lost
consciousness. He woke up some time later and drove home. At
home his wife noted he was bleeding from his ear, and called
EMS. He was taken to an OSH then transfered here. In the ED here
he was found to have a temporal bone fracture and a small ICH.
ENT and Nsurg were consulted, and he was admitted to Nsurg for
further management.
.
On Nsurg, he received a total of 30mg vitamin K and 5 units of
FFP to reverse his INR (he is on warfarin for afib). His INR has
remained elevated but his bleed is small and his neurologic exam
is intact. During his second day of admission he became
increasingly hypoxic. There was concern for a PE so he was sent
to CTA chest yesterday. CTA showed no PE but ?aspiration
pneumonitis. Medicine was consulted to assist with management.
He was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole as well as
standing nebs. His sats stabilized. Overnight he became
increasingly hypertensive, tachycardic, and agitated consistent
with etOH withdrawl. He was receiving lorazepam 0.5mg IV Q2H
with little impact. In the AM he was re-evaluated by Med
Consult, who started diazepam 5-10mg PO Q2H and Zyprexa for
agitation. Nsurg has been giving his metoprolol overnight for
HTN, but this was changed to hydralazine. He was increasingly
SOB, so he received Lasix 20mg IV x1. Given his complex medical
issues and ongoing alcohol withdrawl, he was transfered to the
MICU for further management.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD [**1-21**]:
1. Limited study due to motion.
2. Right frontal extra-axial hematoma, likely subdural, 2 mm in
greatest
transverse dimension. Probable subdural hematoma along the
anterior falx. 3mm left frontal hyperdensity most likely
subdural hematoma.
3. Bilateral inferior frontal and left frontal hyperdensities,
which may be artifact or subarachnoid or intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.
4. Nondisplaced temporal bone fracture, not well assessed due to
motion.
Partial opacification left mastoid air cells.
5. Soft tissue gas around the left mandibular condyle and ramus.

- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-1-21**] 2:29 AM FINDINGS:
Examination is degraded by motion artifact, which persisted
despite repeating the examination. Hyperdensity overlying the
right frontotemporal lobe (5:[**12-13**]) is consistent with acute
blood, likely subdural hematoma, measuring 2 mm in greatest
transverse dimension. Hyperdensity along the anterior falx
(2:13-14) is concerning for subdural hematoma. A hyperdense 3 mm
focus overlying the anterior left frontal lobe is consistent
with acute blood, likely subdural. Bifrontal hyperdensities of
the inferior frontal lobes (5:10) may be due to artifact, or
subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is no
intraventricular hemorrhage.  There is no mass effect, shift of
midline structures or edema. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter  differentiation
is preserved. There appears to be a nondisplaced left temporal
bone fracture (3:16), although this is not well evaluated due to
motion artifact. Left mastoid air cells are partially opacified.
Soft tissue gas is identified around the left mandibular condyle
and ramus. IMPRESSION: 1. Limited study due to motion. 2. Right
frontal extra-axial hematoma, likely subdural, 2 mm in greatest
transverse dimension. Probable subdural hematoma along the
anterior falx. 3mm left frontal hyperdensity most likely
subdural hematoma. 3. Bilateral inferior frontal and left
frontal hyperdensities, which may be artifact or subarachnoid or
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. 4. ondisplaced temporal bone
fracture, not well assessed due to motion. artial opacification
left mastoid air cells. 5. Soft tissue gas around the left
mandibular condyle and ramus.
.
- CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2129-1-21**] 9:48 AM Again
noted is  small acute subdural hematoma in the bilateral
inferior frontal egions along the gyri recti or straight gyrus,
extending superiorly up the anterior falx. This is unchanged in
size and appearance from prior as is the small associated
subarachnoid hemorrhage. No new areas of hemorrhage are present.
No areas of edema or large infarctions are noted either. The
prior noted left nondisplaced temporal bone fracture is also
unchanged.  Partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells
persists. The remaining paranasal sinuses and right mastoid air
cells are well aerated. IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged frontal
subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 2. No change in
nondisplaced left temporal bone fracture.
