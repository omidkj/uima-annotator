Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
58M w/ PMH of hx of lung CA (BAC) with liver mets on gemcitabine
who presents with 2 days of worsening cough productive of white
sputum, subjective low grade fevers, shortness of breath. The
history is provided via translation by the son. [**Name (NI) **] reports that
he told his father he needed to go the [**Name (NI) **] on [**2142-6-23**] and drove
him in to [**Hospital1 18**] after speaking with his oncologist. Pt has had
chest pain with coughing, non-exertional, non-pleuritic. No leg
swelling, chills. No recent hospitalizations. On further
questioning, patient does endorse history of wheezing with cold
air. Denies orthopnea or PND.  Of note, according to OMR patient
was seen [**2142-6-5**] for chemo and was c/o cough and congestion. He
was noted to be wheezy, with good oxygen sat on RA, and was
ordered for bronchodilators.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 99.4 125 138/84 96% RA. He was triggered
for being tachy to 130s and tachypneic to 30s, hypoxic to low
90s on RA. Tight breath sounds with wheezes on exam. More cough
and rhonchi after nebs. Considered PE in differential but given
infiltrate decided no CTA. Labs notable for lactate 2.2, WBC 8.5
with 86%N, Hct 35 (baseline), phos 1.8, AP 389 (had been
increasing recently). PCXR showed RLL infiltrate c/f PNA. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia. Blood cultures drawn. He was given
cefepime, ipratropium neb x2, albuterol nebs x3, vancomycin 1
gram, 1.5L NS.
.
Pt was transferred directly to the MICU from the ED because of
worsening tachypnea and tachycardia. On arrival to the MICU, he
stated he was breathing a little bit better.


Past Medical History:
- metastatic lung cancer (pt not a smoker)
** See onc note form [**2141-11-7**] for entire oncology hx
- benign sigmoid polyps
- Hernia repair on [**2141-5-19**].

metastatic lung cancer (pt not a smoker)-history below
--[**6-1**] CXR that revealed a 4 x 4 cm right middle lobe nodule.
---[**7-1**] CT scan revealed a 4.5 x 4.8 cm right perihilar mass as

well as numerous confluent right upper lobe nodules and
subcarinal lymphadenopathy. There were tiny contralateral
nodules noted in the left lower lobe, none larger than 3 mm.
--[**7-1**] needle core biopsy of the right lung mass, which revealed
 adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, consistent with
non-mucinous bronchoalveolar carcinoma. EGFR mutation status
unknown. He was started on Tarceva.
--[**2137**]-[**2139**] He did well on Tarceva. Subsequent scans in
[**Month (only) **] as well as [**2138-11-24**] revealed a marked
improvement in his disease. He was scanned serially
approximately every three months while on Tarceva with no
evidence of worsening disease until [**10/2140**]
--[**11-3**] CT scan right perihilar mass was again noted to be as
large as 4 x 4 cm. Also in [**10/2140**], he developed visual changes
in the right eye. He was subsequently noted to have a large
detachment of the macula with an oval choroidal lesion
underneath  the superior temporal arcade in the right eye,
presumably due to  metastatic disease.
--[**12-3**] He subsequently underwent radiation up to 20 Gy at [**Hospital 88830**] Infirmary and has done well with good control of the
 lesion per outside hospital reports.
--[**2-/2141**] CT scan revealed persistent right perihilar lung mass
measuring 4.1 cm, multiple nodules in a right perihilar
distribution GGO RML, 8 mm nodule in the right hepatic lobe, a
1.5 cm nodule immediately adjacent in the right hepatic lobe in
a  subcapsular location, as well as a stable hepatic cyst,
suspicious lymph node in the region of the gastrohepatic
ligament  measuring 9 mm in short axis. He continued on Tarceva.

--[**2141-5-5**] worsening periumbilical pain. CT scan revealed
abnormal increased density in the inferior right hilum with a
small right pleural effusion, a round area of decreased
attenuation in the right lobe of the liver, which had the
appearance of a cyst, and three rounded areas of decreased
attenuation in the right lobe of the liver, which appeared to
have increased in size when compared to the CAT scan done on
[**2141-3-8**]. There were also small lesions in the left lobe of
the liver.
--[**2141-5-19**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5877**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19122**] for repair of an umbilical
hernia. Pathology revealed a metastatic well-to-moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma in the hernia sac and contents
with  strong positivity for CK-7 and TTF-1 and negative for
CK-20. The  sample was sent for EGFR testing, which was
negative.
---[**2141-5-29**] ultrasounded-guided core biopsy of the liver
revealed a metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with a lung
primary of a bronchoalveolar type. No EGFR mutation was
detected. insufficient tissue for ALK testing.
--[**2141-6-14**] PET CT: FDG avid right perihilar coalescent
pulmonary  mass with satellite lesions and moderate pleural
effusion. Avid  supraclavicular, mediastinal and retroperitoneal
adenopathy as  detailed. Left adrenal and multiple (at least 5)
hepatic  metastases. Extensive omental caking. Osseous
metastases involving C3 vertebral body, posterior left 10th rib,
proximal femurs, left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], and sacrum.
--[**2141-6-14**] MRI brain: Proliferation of intraconal fat in the
right orbit, with mild mass effect on the optic nerve, likely
representing a sequela of known radiotherapy to this site. No
suspicious parenchymal, meningeal or bone lesion to suggest
metastatic disease.
--[**2141-8-8**]: started 5 cycles of carboplatin/alimta
--[**2141-9-21**]: CT torso: Interval improvement in the size of the
right lung nodules; perihilar mass 2.1 x 1.8 cm previously 4.2 x
 3.4. Stable appearance of liver, adrenal and omental metastatic
 disease. Significant interval worsening of multiple sclerotic
bony lesions, mild interval worsening of moderate-to-large
hyperenhancing right pleural effusion.
--[**2141-11-7**] started alimta maintenance
--[**2142-1-19**] CT torso:
Interval worsening hepatic metastatic lesions with increase in
size and number of the metastatic deposits. Stable to slightly
decreased pulmonary disease. Decrease in omental masses. Stable
right pleural effusion. Stable osseous metastatic tumor.
--[**2142-5-16**] CT torso, no appreciable change in the diffuse
multiple bilateral small pulmonary nodules or right-sided
pleural  effusion or mediastinal adenopathy. There has been an
increase  in the size and number of hepatic metastasis, the
largest now to  44 mm from 31 and now there is a new lesion from
segment III.
There is diffuse omental thickening and stranding consistent
with  metastatic disease, which is present on prior study, but
subjectively appears to have increased. Bone windows again
demonstrate metastatic disease with potentially a new 3 mm
sclerotic focus at T8 and possibly L4.
--[**2142-5-8**] started gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2. week 3 held for
thrombocytopenia.
- benign sigmoid polyps
- Hernia repair on [**2141-5-19**]
- h/o duodenitis
- h/o thrombocytopenia
