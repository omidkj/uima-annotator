Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension, SVT, hypercalcemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
70-year-old female, 50 pack-year tobacco use, with poor medical
follow up who presents with neck pain.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until 3 weeks prior
to presentation. At that time she developed insidious onset of
neck/back pain. She also noted right upper extremity weakness
and difficulty ambulating. Three days prior to presentation, she
developed confusion and generalized weakness. The family was
concerned and scheduled an appointment with a primary care
physician for an evaluation. The primary care physician who took
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest X-ray, which showed a lung mass and right pleural
effusion. She notes a 12 pound weight loss over last 3 weeks.
She denied fever, chills, cough, hemoptysis, or headache.
.
The day of presentation the patient presented to [**Hospital1 **] for
CT and MRI for further work-up. At BIDN, the patient was noted
to be febrile to 103F. She had WBC of 17 and Ca of 15. Her
imaging showed diffuse metastatic disease with invasion of
spinal cord. She was given zolendonic acid and 4.5 L NS. She
also developed hypotension and tachycardia which responded to a
fluid bolus. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for an ortho spine
consult.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], initial vitals were: T 98.3, HR 114, BP 84/40, RR 18,
SaO2 96% 3L NC. Ortho Spine was consulted and evaluated the
patient (please see ortho spine note) and believe the patient
needs oncologic workup with multipl more imaging studies. She
was admitted to MICU given her hypotension at the OSH.
.
Currently, the patient notes mild neck pain but is otherwise
comfortable.
.
ROS: difficult to obtain, patient confused.

Hypertension

Social History:
50 pack-year tobacco history. Quit smoking 1 year ago. Denies

Pertinent Results:
[**Hospital1 **] IMAGING:
CXR: There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with
blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  There is patchy
opaciifcation of the right lower and middle lobe with
obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm and to a lesser extent,
the right heart border. Somewhat nodular density is seen in the
right lower zone. Left lung base appears clear and there is no
evidence of left-sided
effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Mild background
degenerative changes are seen at the glenohumeral and
acromioclavicular joints. Right scapular outline is poorly
defined, correlating with CT finding of osseaous lesion (see CT
report). IMPRESSION: RIGHT BASAL/MIDDLE LOBE OPACIFICATION AND
SCAPULAR LESION AND PLEURAL EFFUSION.
.
CTA: 1.  NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLUS. 2.  EXTENSIVE
MEDIASTINAL LYMPHADENOPATHY IN ADDITION TO RIGHT HILAR MASS WITH
RIGHT MIDDLE LOBE COLLAPSE LIKELY REFLECTING PRIMARY
BRONCHOGENIC NEOPLASM WITH EXTENSIVE METASTATIC DISEASE. 3.
NUMEROUS LARGE PLEURAL-BASED METASTASES IN THE RIGHT HEMITHORAX
PARTICULARLY AT THE RIGHT BASE WITH SOFT TISSUE ALSO EXTENDING
FROM THIS INTO THE POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM AND INTO THE
PERICARDIAL FAT PAD ON THE RIGHT. 4.  VERY EXTENSIVE BONY
METASTATIC DISEASE INCLUDING A LARGE SCAPULAR METASTASIS,
LEFT-SIDED RIB METASTASIS AND MULTIPLE SPINAL METASTASES, MANY
OF WHICH EXHIBIT MASS EFFECT AND NARROW THE SPINAL CANAL.
ASSESSMENT FOR CORD COMPRESSION WITH THORACIC SPINE MRI IS
RECOMMENDED.
.
CT HEAD: 1.  NO EVIDENCE OF ACUTE INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE. 2.  A
FOCAL CORTICAL HYPODENSITY INVOLVING THE LEFT INSULA, WHICH [**Month (only) **]
BE FURTHER CHARACTERIZED BY MR, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. 3.
BILATERAL CONFLUENT HYPODENSITIES INVOLVING SUBCORTICAL AND
PERIVENTRICULAR WHITE MATTER, WHICH [**Month (only) **] BE REFLECTIVE OF SMALL
VESSEL ISCHEMIC DISEASE. 4.  MULTIPLE LYTIC LESIONS INVOLVING
THE CALVARIUM, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THESE LESIONS ARE CONCERNING
FOR METASTATIC DISEASE.  FURTHER EVALUATION WITH A BONE SCAN [**Month (only) **]
BE CONSIDERED.  MR [**Month (only) **] BE OBTAINED TO EVALUATE FOR POSSIBLE
METASTATIC PROCESS WITHIN THE BRAIN PARENCHYMA.
.
MRI Spine: Widely disseminated, likely metastatic neoplastic
disease, with the largest lesion being at T1, and involving the
posterior
elements.  Cervical spondylosis.
.
[**Hospital1 18**] IMAGING:
[**2110-1-23**] CXR:
Large area of opacity involving the right mid-to-lower lung
which
may represent a combination of mass, pleural effusion,
atelectasis and consolidation; given history of new lung mass,
without prior for comparison.  The lung mass may be in the right
infrahilar region and/or right mid-to-lower lung underlying the
area of opacity. Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
.
[**2110-1-23**] CT head:
1. Diffuse white matter hypodensities may represent chronic
microvascular disease, subacute watershed infarcts, and/or
underlying mass lesions.  Contrast-enhanced MRI is suggeted for
further evaluation.
2. Multiple calvarial metastases.

Brief Hospital Course:
70-year-old female, 50 pack-year tobacco use, with poor medical
follow up who presents with metastatic cancer, cord compression
and hypercalcemia.
.
# Metastatic cancer: Most likely lung cancer given appearance on
imaging and smoking history with suspicious lesion in lung.
Given diffuse nature of the disease likely would be a very poor
prognosis. Discussions held with daughter and family and
agreement was made that patient would not want any invasive
procedures for diagnosis and preference would be to go home with
hospice. She was made DNR/DNI and palliative care was consulted
for hospice initiation. Pain controlled with oral regimen
morphine SR 60mg PO and morphine liquid as per scale for
breakthrough at time of discharge.  She was also given ativan
PRN for anxiety, lidoderm patch and scopolamine for secretions.
She will have hospice VNA as well.
.
# Cord Compression: Evidence of encasement of spinal cord by
tumor. Evaluated by ortho spine who request multiple imaging
studies but based on patient's goals of care ti was dcided to
continue dexamathasone but discontinue spine precuationsa nd
cervical collar since advancement of weakness and cord
compression would likely be related to advancement of overall
disease. Decadron continued but doing changed to [**Hospital1 **] given
patient agitation.
