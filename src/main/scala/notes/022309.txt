Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
anterior wall STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary Catheterization X2
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
83yo with a history DM, HTN, and MI with RCA stenting in [**2127**]
arrived to ED by ambulance after 1 hr of substernal chest pain
that came on while shoveling snow at approximately 11am this
morning.  Upon arrival to the ED he was found to have ST
elevations in V1-V5 with ST depressions in  II, III, AvF and Q
waves in v1-V5 and new RBB.  He was urgently taken to cardiac
cath where he was found to have complete acute occlusion of the
proximal LAD with an completely occluded RCA and 90% occluded
circumflex. After angioplasty flow was recovered in the LAD and
a stent was placed.  During the procedure the patient had
multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and underwent
electrocardioversion several times and started on amiodarone. He
vomitted and was intubated. He became hypotensive and was
started on dopamine 15mcg/kg.  Post procedure PCWP was 40 mm/Hg
with V waves to 80.  Bedside echo showed an VEF of 20-25% with
3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 6**] aortic balloon pump was not placed because he has a
tortuous aorta.
During the procedure he received over 600cc of contrast and was
given 40mg of lasix.

ROS: Per wife,  cardiac review of systems is notable for two
weeks of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and presyncope. No chest
pain before today's acute event. Also no paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or palpitations.

#ECHO on [**2-21**]: LVEF = 20% ; 3+ MR ;
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the anterior wall, septum, distal LV segments
and apex. There is hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (no
papillary muscle rupture or frank prolapse seen). There is no
pericardial effusion.

#Cardiac Catheterization on [**2137-2-21**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
3 vessel CAD. The LMCA had no obstruction. The LAD was flush
occluded
proximallly. The LCX had an 80% mid lesion adn an 80% OM1. The
RCA was
occluded in the mid vessel and filled distally via collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right sided
filling pressures, cardiogenic shock with a PCWP of 40 with V
waves to
55.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a
overlapping
2.5 x 18 and 2.5 x 12 mm minivision stents which were post
dilated with
a 3.0 x 15 mm Quantum balloon. Final angiography revealed no
residual
stenosis, no dissection and TIMI III flow.
5. Acute anterior STEMI, cardiogenic shock and VT requiring
defibrillation/pacing for heart block.

#Cardiac Catheterization on [**3-1**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
stent
thrombosis within the previously placed proximal LAD distal BMS.
The
LMCA had no significant disease. The LAD stents were patent with
a
distal filling defect and probable stent underexpansion with
stent
thrombosis. The LCX was unchanged from prior. The RCA was not
engaged.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial
pressures with
an SBP of 120 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Successful balloon angioplasty of the LAD stents with a 2.75
balloon
with no residual stenosis, defect or dissection.

# [**2-28**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale
and Doppler
examination of the bilateral common femoral, superficial
femoral, and
popliteal veins was performed.  There is a deep venous
thrombosis in the right
superficial femoral vein extending all the way down to the
popliteal vein with
intraluminal clot expanding the vein and absence of flow
consistent with
complete occlusion.  The right common femoral vein is patent.
There is no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the left leg.
IMPRESSION:  DVT on the right extending from the superficial
femoral vein to the popliteal vein.

# [**3-4**] V/Q scan: Low probability

# [**3-4**] CXR:IMPRESSION: Mild CHF with small pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**], anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2
overlapping BMS to proximal LAD, anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with
stent thrombosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI.

# CAD/Ischemia:  Status post STEMI and RCA stent in [**2127**],
anterior STEMI [**2137-2-21**] with 2 overlapping BMS to proximal LAD,
anterior STEMI [**2137-3-1**] with stent thrombosis.  Patient presented
with anterior STEMI with ST elevations V1-V4 and ST depressions
in II III and aVf.  By cardiac angiography he was found to have
completely occluded proximal LAD, 80% occlusion of the Lcx and
complete proximal occlusion of the RCA with distal flow from
collaterals. The LAD lesion was opened by angioplasty and a bare
metal stent was placed.  During the procedure the patient became
hypotensive with episodes of V Tach and V fib requiring multiple
cardioversions.  After emesis he was intubated for airway
protection. He was then transfered to the CCU and started on
[**Month/Day/Year **], plavix, and heparin. On [**2137-3-1**] pt developed chest pain
while at rest and was found to have anterior ST elevations in
V1-V3. He was treated with nitroglycerin, O2, and morphine which
resulted in alleviation of his symptoms. At cardiac
catheterization he was found to have an LAD stent thrombosis
that was opened with balloon angioplasty resulting in improved
flow through the LAD stent.  He remains on Toprol XL 25mg daily,
[**Last Name (LF) 17339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and Plavix daily.
