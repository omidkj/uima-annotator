History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 81 F with multiple medical problems including DM,
PVD, HTN, CAD s/p CABG, diastolic CHF, recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**2155-6-7**] to [**2155-6-26**], from OSH with acute ischemia of
the left foot. At OSH, angioplasty was attempted x 2 but failed.
Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where [**Hospital1 **] Surgery (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] performed emergent angioplasty of the anterior tibialis
with tPA. Pt was started on ASA and Plavix. Her hospital course
was also notable for ARF (likely contrast induced), and SVT, for
which she received amiodarone.
.
On [**2155-6-22**] pt had streaking of blood per rectum, subsequently
developed melena, and had decrease in HCT from 28 to 23,
requiring blood transfusion. EGD on [**2155-6-23**] revealed
"granularity, friability, erythema, congestion, nodularity and
erosion in the antrum and stomach body compatible with erosive
gastritis" and regarding the duodenum, showed "localized
erythema and friability of the mucosa with contact bleeding
noted in the proximal bulb compatible with duodenitis." A
colonoscopy showed "erythema, congestion and ulceration in the
colon compatible with diffuse colonic ischemia. Diverticulosis
of the sigmoid colon was also noted." She underwent ultrasound
of her celiac/SMA, and no focal stenosis was found. Over the
next few days, her HCT stabilized and she was discharged to
rehab with HCT=33, on a medical regimen of ASA and Plavix.
.
Per report from rehab on [**6-30**] pt had maroon stools, Hct= 25.7.
Plavix and ASA were discontinued, which was agreed to by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  On [**7-2**] Hct= 22.9, BP was 129/64.  Attempts were made
to obtain IV access, but were reportedly unsucessful due to
edema of the hands.  The patient was therefore transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for LGIB without IV access.
.
ROS: Fatigue, poor PO [**2-6**] anorexia.

Past Medical History:
DM
CAD s/p CABG in [**2140**]
PVD s/p angioplasty [**6-10**], left first toe necrosis
HTN

spinal stenosis
CREST syndrome (recently diagnosed, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3057**]
Gastritis/Duodenitis
Ishcemic colitis
- s/p lower GI bleed possibly due to ischemic colon [**6-10**], in
setting of asa/plavix.

Social History:
Pt lives alone at home.  Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from rehabiliation
facility. Family is involved.  Pt notes quitting tobacco 40 yrs
ago, had smoked 10 yrs, [**1-6**] ppd.  She denies regular ETOH
consumption, or illicit drug use.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

HEENT: PERRLA, EOMI, anicteric + Left IJ, no mucosal lesions
visualized, no petichea, or ulcers, or thrush.
LUNGS: posterior exam limited, laterally at base both sides -

right, decreased BS on left base-- limited exam.
Cardiac: occasionally irregular S1, S2,? PVC's.
Abdomen: Obses soft , NT, ND, +BS.
EXT: + Ecchymosis of b/l upper ext, as well as pectichea grouped
on the knees- pt. attributes to recent fall (during last
hospitalization). + b/l upper ext with edema around the
antecubital fossa. + Left U Ext antecubital fossa with erythema
and increased warmth on palpation.
Left L EXT: + Heel - around 2-3 cm area of erythema/ecchymosis.
+ Left Toe with significant necrosis (pt. does have sensation in
area adjacent to necrotic margin. + 1+ DP b/l feet- warm.
+ Left Upper Ext with index finger and 5th finger
necrosis/calcinosis.
Neuro: AXOx3, sensation grossly intact in bilateral upper
extremities, and lower extremities excluding areas of necrosis.
Motor examination of lower extremities limited due to
pain/generalised weakness.

involving the transverse colon and hepatic flexure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-2**], pt's Hct was found to be 21.8.
She was admitted and received 2U PRBCs.  Over the next few days,
she had occasional bloody bowel movements but her HCT remained
stable around 28-30.  However, on HD#4 pt's HCT began to drop
again and she was noted to have more bloody bowel movements.  Pt
was also complaining of nausea and she received Compazine.  She
became somnolent following this medication and a trigger was
called for altered mental status.  Given her increased BRBPR,
HCT drop, and change in mental status, she was transferred to
the MICU.
.
MICU COURSE:
.
1. GI bleed - Upon arrival to the MICU, pt denied dizziness or
lightheadedness.  She was A&Ox3.  Central venous access was
placed, and the pt received IV PPI and 5U PRBCs.  Serial HCT
showed improvement (25->32).  Surgery was made aware of the pt,
however the pt had previously declined surgical intervention.
GI deferred repeat colonoscopy because of the positive c.
difficile toxin B infection.  If the bleed were to worsen, the
plan was for tagged RBC scan; however this was not required as
the bleeding stabilized.  ASA, Plavix, and BP meds were
initially held [**2-6**] concern about bleeding, however once her BP
were stable, her BP meds were gradually restarted.  She was
transferred to the regular wards in hemodynamically stable
condition.
.
After transfer from the MICU to the floor, pt was gradually
transitioned to her home medication regimen.  She also continued
to receive treatment for her c. difficile infection with flagyl
(for a total course of 14d, last day [**2155-7-19**]).  Serial HCT
remained stable in the low 30s.  She developed nausea, typically
in the AM, this was managed with anzemet (as Compazine and
phenergan caused increased drowsiness), and improved somewhat
with diuresis.
.
.
2. CAD/CHF - Regarding the pt's CAD, her EKG was without changes
on this admission.  ASA and Plavix were held secondary to
concern over GI bleeding.  With regard to her history of CHF, BP
meds were held initially over concern for bleeding, however
after HCT improved, they were started again.  Pt likely requires
some degree of afterload reduction once hemodynamically stable,
however given her renal insufficiency, she may not tolerate an
ACE-inhibitor.  Regarding the pt's AF/SVT the pt continued to
receive her outpatient regimen of amiodarone.
.
Pt noted an episode of chest tightness and SOB (O2 sats in low
90s on 4L, up from 2L) on the morning of [**2155-7-10**].  EKG showed no
changes, pt was seen by her cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and cardiac
etiology was felt unlikely.  CXR showed increasing right side
pleural effusions, the episodes were felt likely [**2-6**] worsening
fluid status with a component of anxiety.  As such, the decision
was made to more aggressively diurese with lasix in order to
improve her breathing and comfort on [**7-11**] (lasix 80mg IV qAM,
40mg IV qhs).  By the morning of [**7-15**], her SOB was considerably
improved, she was
