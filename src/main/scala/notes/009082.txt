Imaging:
CT sinus/face [**2137-11-30**]:
1. Extensive inflammatory changes in the right lateral and
anterior neck with packing material/drain in place. Slightly
limited by lack of IV contrast, but no discernable fluid
collection.
2. Apical lucency about the left lower molar. No periapical
lucency seen in the area of concern (right lower tooth).
3. Extensive sinus disease.
4. Cervical lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for a right submandibular abscess.  She was
preoped, consented, and underwent a right neck I/D on [**2137-11-30**].
Please Dr.[**Name (NI) 20390**] operative note for details.  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the SICU
intubated.  She was continued on unasyn.  She returned to the OR
the following day for teeth extraction.  Please see Dr. [**Name (NI) 81605**] operative note for details.  Again she tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the SICU intubated without
events.  She was successfully extubated that evening.  Patient
was started on nasal irrigations.  Her home medications were
continued.  Physical therapy was consulted to improve strength
and mobility.  She was anemic with a HCT in the low 20s.  Her
hematologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], was contact[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] was alreeady aware
of her blood smear findings suggestive of myelodysplasia and did
not request any further workup or management during this
hospital stay.  On POD3 she was given 2uPRBCs with lasix and was
transferred to the floor.  Her hematocrit appropriately bumped
to 28 and was stable in the high 20s prior to discharge.  Her
penrose drain was slowly backed out and removed on POD4.
Culture sensitivities returned on POD4, showing MRSA.  An ID
consult was obtained at that time, recommending switching from
unasyn to vancomycin and flagyl.  A PICC was successfully placed
on POD5. A vancomycin trough level was low at 9.6.  We
subsequently increased her dosing frequency from QD to [**Hospital1 **].
Another vanco trough should be checked prior to 3rd dose of new
[**Hospital1 **] dosing regimen.  Her first dose at [**Hospital1 **] interval was on
[**2136-12-5**] at 0800.  She is to receive IV vancomycin until [**2136-12-19**]
(time of f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic).  On POD7 she was transferred to a
rehab facility in good condition.  Please note that she will
need to be set up for weekly lab draws (CBC, BUN/Cr, ALT/AST) to
be faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 432**] ([**Hospital **] clinic).
