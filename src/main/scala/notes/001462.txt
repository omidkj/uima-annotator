Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred from OSH for NSTEMI and Cardiac Cath.

1) CAD/NSTEMI: Pt was CP free throughout her admission. Her TnT
peaked at 0.11 (CK 87) and trended down. Cath on [**8-1**] revealed
LAD-50% mid; RCA-95% mid, distal filling into collaterals. The
RCA was stented. The cath was complicated by arterial
perforation and hematoma formation: see below. She was continued
on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor, and Metoprolol. An ECHO on [**8-2**] showed
preserved systolic dysfunction but impaired relaxation. An ACE-i
was not stated because of borderline BPs. She was instructed to
f/u with a cardiologist or her PCP to resume this med.

2) Arterial Perf (Ext Iliac/Common Fem)/Blood Loss Anemia: As
noted, cath was complicated by external iliac/common femoral
perforationAfter cath, HCT was down to 29.1 and pt had SBPs to
70s-80s. Pt was transfered to ICU where she was transufed,
started on IVF, and then recovered. Per 2nd angio, no continued
bleeding was noted. In total she rec'd 3 units PRBC. Her HCT
remained above 30 after the 3rd unit was given and her  SBPs
ranged from 100-120s thereafter as well. An Abd CT confirmed a
retroperitoneal bleed: "Extraperitoneal stranding extending from
the right kidney into the right deep pelvis consistent with
retroperitoneal hemorrhage."

3) UTI: Her initial UA was positive and she was started on a 3
day course of Levofloxacin 500mg q24hr. She was given
Phenazopyridine for symptomatic relief of dysuria.

4) GERD: Continue Pantoprazole and Maalox prn.

5) Pneumonia: At the conclusion of her course, she had mild decr
of O2 sats from baseline (90-94%RA) and a CXR was read as mild
RML PNA. She was continued on Levo for an addn't 7 days.

6) Code: Full.

7) FEN: Cont'd Cards Healthy diet.

8) Dispo. DCed to home.
