Chief Complaint:
INFERIOR STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
59 yo M active smoker with HTN began noting intermittent
nonexertional SSCP over the past week. This pain then became
sustained last evening and continued when he awoke in the
morning of [**1-19**]. It did not seem to progress significantly. Pt
presented to the [**Hospital3 3583**] ED where he was noted to have
ST elevations in an inferior distribution with biphasic T-waves
at 10am. He was initially treated with ASA 325, plavix 600,
SLNTG, morphine, IV heparin and Integrillin. He had taken his
home atenolol 100mg that morning. He was transiently bradycardic
in the 20s--resolved without intervention.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] by [**Location (un) 7622**] where he was taken to
the cath lab directly. No disease noted in the LM or LCX; 40%
stenosis of the LAD. There was an occlusive thrombus in the mid
portion of the RCA removed. Two DES were deployed with good flow
2 hours 40 minutes after his arrival to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 46**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. During
the procedure, the pt became bradycardic to the 30s and
hypotensive. BP normalized with RV pacing which became
unnecessary after the procedure was complete. RV pacing lead was
removed prior to tx to CCU.
.
The pt describes himself as active: he drives a truck but gets
in and out to make deliveries dozens of times per day. He has
never had exertional CP with lifting heavy objects. He is
currently smoking 1.5 packs per day.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CARDIAC CATH:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Right coronary STEMI.
2. Elevated left-sided filling pressures.
3. Successful thrombectomy, PTCA and stenting of the RCA.
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.

ECHO: [**2154-1-21**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
inferior ischemia/infarction. No pathologic valvular abnormality
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M smoker with HTN and Family Hx of CAD presented with
inferior STEMI c/b sinus bradycardia now s/p DES x2 to the RCA
and hemodynamically stable.

STEMI: The patient was found to have an occulsive thrombus in
the RCA s/p thrombectomy and s/p DESx2 to the RCA. His cardiac
enzymes implied that the patient had a small to moderate sized
heart attack.  He was treated with heparin initially and
continued on integrillin until 18hrs post cath.  He was started
on Aspirin 325mg, Plavix 75mg daily for at least one year,
Lipitor 80mg (LDL 120, HDL 35).  The patient was intially
bradycardic after his MI; however that slowly improved and low
dose metoprolol (changed from home atenolol) was started.
Metoprolol succinate was uptitrated to 50mg daily prior to
discharge.  Patient would likely benefit from ACEI if blood
pressure could tolerate in the future.  His echocardiogram
showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments, EF
50-55%.  Counseled on smoking cessation to reduce risk of future
cardiovascular event.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**],
You were admitted to the hospital with a heart attack.  You
underwent a cardiac catheterization and were found to have a
clot in one of your arteries that supplies blood flow to your
heart.  The clot was removed and 2 stents were placed in your
arteries.  You will need to take Plavix and Aspirin every day
for at least one year to keep your stents open.  Do NOT stop
taking Aspirin or Plavix unless instructed to do so by your
Cardiologist.

We made the following changes to your medications:
1. Aspirin: to keep the stents open and prevent another heart
attack.
2. Plavix: to keep the stents open
3. Atorvastatin: to lower your bad cholesterol and increase
your good cholesterol.
4. Metoprolol succinate: a beta blocker to prevent another heart
attack and to slow your heart rate.
5. We STOPPED Atenolol.
.
The most important thing you can do for your health is to stop
smoking. We discussed ways to do this but you can call Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 39360**] if you need a prescription to help you stop.


Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with your primary care doctor in the next [**1-26**]
weeks.
