Pertinent Results:
[**7-6**] cardiac cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD was totally ocluded at the
ostium. The LCX ahd minimal disease. The RCA had 90% long mid
stenosis. 2.  Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The
systemic arterial pressures were mildly elevated. 3.  Attempt
was made to wire the flush occluded LAD with a choice PT wire.
However the lesion felt hard and chronic and since the wire
would not pass easily attempts at intervention were aborted.
The diffusely diseased right lesion was felt to be too high a
risk as it supplied LAD collaterals. The patient was taken off
the table and is to be evaluated for potential CABG.
[**7-7**] carotid u/s: Mild atherosclerotic changes bilaterally with
less than 40% stenosis of the internal carotid arteries on both
sides.
[**7-9**] echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the mid- and distal anterior wall and
septum, and apex, consistent with a mid-LAD lesion (LVEF 30%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**7-12**] cxr: All the various lines and tubes have been removed.
Atelectasis is seen at the left base but no evidence of a
pneumothorax is seen on
either side, no failure or pneumonia is present.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted after
experiencing increasing chest pain with abnormal EKG. She
underwent a cardiac cath on [**7-6**] which revealed two vessel
coronary artery disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted for
bypass surgery. She was worked-up in the usual pre-operative
manner which also included carotid u/s and echo. She remained on
medical management for several days awaiting Plavix washout and
on [**7-10**] was brought to the operating room. She underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 2. Please see operative report
for surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to
the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. Pressors were weaned off also by post-op day one
and she was started on beta blockers and diuretics. She was
gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Chest tubes were
removed on post-op day two. On post-op day three the
cardiology/EP service were consulted secondary to SVT/Atrial
tachycardia. Later on this day she appeared stable and was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. She
converted back to a normal sinus rhythm with adenosine and
amiodarone. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. She was
discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor to be transmitted to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
