History of Present Illness:
50M with history of heavy ETOH use, Meniere's disease,
psychiatric history including panic disorder, depression &
anxiety, presented 2d ago with hematemesis, RUQ & R-sided chest
pain, and intoxication after binge drinking. Binge drinks on
vodka 1/5 L at a time, recurrent admissions for withdrawal
management and detox. 3 days ago he started having severe RUQ
pain, non-radiating, exacerbated by movement and eating, no
known alleviating factors. Started vomiting 2 days PTA; vomiting
progressively increasing frequency until admission. Vomiting
intermittently streaked w/black blood. ROS positive for mild,
productive cough x1 week & gradual weight loss x 2 years,
negative for F/C.
.
Substance abuse history includes 30 yrs heavy drinking, several
admissions for ETOH withdrawal, hx attending dual diagnosis
detox programs, 2 withdrawal seizures (one at home, one while
hospitalized). Past ICU admissions for DTs. Longest sober period
was 5 years ([**2155**]-[**2160**]). Cocaine and marijuana use in the past,
not currently using.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 140 132/90 16 95%. Coffee ground
emesis witness in the ED but unknown volume. RUQ US negative for
cholecystitis. CXR showed RLL opacity, slightly more dense than
prior. Labs notable for leukocytosis WBC 13 (w/ 87.4% PMN no
bands), ETOH 202, plt 105, HCT 38 -> 33. Total 3L IVF received,
no blood products given. Received diazepam 10mg x2, Ativan 2mg
x2, morphine 4mg x1, PPI bolus/gtt, and zofran. Despite
benzodiazepines, he remained tachycardic and tremulous. 2 large
bore PIVs placed.
.
In the MICU over the past 2d he was retching frequently. No
further hematemesis, but he did receive benzos on CIWA for
tremor, anxiety & tachycardia. Reported similar vomiting
episodes have occured with Meniere's disease flares previously.
C/o persistent RUQ pain. He received IVF for low uop.
.
He has been followed in the MICU by GI who initially recommend
EGD but delaying until patient no longer retching and
withdrawing from ETOH. Suggested NGT placement (not done),
antiemetics (on compazine), PPi drip, and transfusion for Hct
<25. Hct stable >25 x3 today. When rectal exam showed guaiac
positive brown stool, GI concluded no indication for EGD. CT
chest showed R rib fracture (minimally displaced ninth and
nondisplaced eighth). Also increased RLL opacity on CXR read as
worsening atelectasis. Prior to MICU callout his benzos were
decreased to q4H and diet advanced to clears. On the floor pt
reports no appetite. Focused on R-sided chest pain where he says
he has multiple rib fractures he suspects he sustained during
his recent bender but cannot remember specifically. We note that
although he reported suicidality w/plan (heroin o/d) during
another recent admission, he denies suicidality at present.

IMAGING
.
RUQ US: No imaging signs of acute cholecystitis. No gallstones.
Normal CBD.
.
CXR: The RLL opacity with chronic pleuroparenchymal scaring and
calcifications has slightly increased over time. Chest CT might
be considered for further work-up. Otherwise, the lungs are
clear, the hila and cardiac shilhouette are normal and there is
no pneumothorax.
.
CT chest/abdomen [**10-28**]:
Increased right lower lobe opacity on chest radiograph likely
reflects superimposition of bibasilar atelectasis upon the
preexisting chronic changes in the basal right pleura.
2. Minimally displaced right ninth rib fracture and nondisplaced
eighth right rib fracture.
