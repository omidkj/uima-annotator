CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman7/19 CABGx2, AVR s/p
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval effusions
REASON FOR THE STUDY: Evaluation for effusion in a 68-year-old
woman with a status post CABG and aortic valve replacement.

TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral view of the chest.

COMPARISON: This study is compared to the previous one done on
[**7-11**].

FINDINGS: There is improving mild bilateral atelectasis, more
dominant on the right. The left small pleural effusion is
improved compared to previous study. Heart size, mediastinal and
hilar contours are normal. The synthetic aortic valve is stable.

IMPRESSION: Improving mild bilateral basilar atelectasis, more
dominant on the right . Small left pleural effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Normal regional LV
systolic function.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior

septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in
aortic root.
Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending
aorta. Normal
aortic arch diameter. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS.
Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. The MR vena contracta is <0.3cm. Mild (1+)
MR. Eccentric
MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. T No atrial
septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal; LVEF > 55%.. Right
ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the
aortic root, aortic arch, and the descending thoracic aorta. The
ascending
aorta has moderate nonmobile plaques. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis
with a severely calcified aortic valve; [**Location (un) 109**] 0.6 cm2. Mild to
moderate ([**12-23**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation
jet is
eccentric. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post bypass: Perserved biventricular function. LVEF > 55%. A
bioprosthetic #21
aortic valve is insitu. There is no Aortic insufficiency,
stenosis, or
perivalvular leaks. Peak gradient on the aortic valve prosthesis
ranges from
5-10 mm hg. Mitral regurgitation is now trace. Aortic contours
are unchanged.
Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time
of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27363**] was taken to the operating room on [**2177-7-9**] where
she underwent an AVR with a #21 CE magna pericardial valve and a
CABG x 1 (SVG->Diag). She was transferred to the SICU in
critical but stable condition. She was extubated and weaned from
her phenylephrine by POD #1. She as transferred to the floor the
same day. She was seen in consultation by infectious diseases
for a question of a small vegeatation on the noncoronary cusp of
her native aortic valve, and she remains on vancomycin until the
OR pathology is final. A PICC line was placed to allow for long
term antibiotics. She was
