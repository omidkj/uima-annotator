History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 22408**] is a 47 year old man with a history of obesity,
asthma, chronic low back pain, and recent rib fracture who
presented to the ED on [**4-14**] for 2 weeks of severe fatigue &
dyspnea on exertion. In [**Month (only) 956**] of this year, the patient was
diagnosed with a right lateral seventh rib fracture following
incidental trauma (leaning over the arm of a chair). On [**4-9**],
the patient was seen in Pulmonology clinic for progressive
dyspnea and bony pain, and his dyspne awas thought attributable
to asthma. He was therefore restarted on pulmicort. , though a
CXR was negative for fracture. His DOE progressed and he
developed profound fatigue, along with nightsweats and fevers.
He therefore presented to the ED on [**4-14**].

There, he endorsed mild subjective fevers at home, but denied
any other B symptoms. Initial vital signs were T98.4 P85
BP129/98 and 97% on RA. Blood work demonstrated a hematocrit of
25.7 (baseline Hct 45), a new thrombocytopenia to 101, and a WBC
of 8.7 with abnormal myeloid cells. He also had a Cr of 2.2
(baseline 0.8) and was noted to have a new murmur on exam. He
was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for further management, but on the floor
he was ill-appearing and further work-up demonstrated a Ca of
17.7 and Uric Acid of 12.9. Coags and fibrinogen were WNL, so he
initiated IVF's, but then triggered on [**4-15**] for increasing O2
requirement, somnolence and AMS and he was transferred to the
ICU for further management.

In the ICU, Heme-Onc & Renal were consulted. He was continued on
aggressive IVF's, Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **], Allopurinol, Pamidronate (last
dose on [**4-15**]), Calcitonin, & Dexamethasone 40mg IV (first dose
on [**4-16**]). His Cr rose to 3.6, but he continued to produce urine.
A CT torso demonstrated diffuse lucencies in the bone without
associated lymphadenopathy consistent with multiple myeloma, and
his SPEP demonstrated a monocloncal IgG kappa spike of 15% of
total protein with normal viscosity. Over the course of his ICU
stay, his serum Ca trended down to 13.7, but his serum phosphate
& uric acid continued to climb. His O2 requirement also
continued to rise and a CXR on [**4-17**] suggested a right middle
lobe pneumonia so he was started on Ceftriaxone & Azithromycin
for CAP. Oncology recommended initiation of chemotherapy and he
was therefore transferred to BMT.

At the time of transfer, his vital signs were: T 97.9 P84 BP
120/67 R 20's O2Sat 95% on 5L, I 4,618cc O 7,090cc. On arrival
to the floor, the patient immediately triggered for an O2Sat of
88-89% on 6L NC, so he was switched to a NRB sat'ing 97%. He was
quickly switched back to 6L, sat'ing 95-96% with a RR of 36. He
appeared uncomfortable and was unable to speak in complete
sentences.

Pertinent Results:
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A
mid-cavitary and outflow tract gradient is identified without
dynamic resting LVOT obstruction (high output state). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: High output stae. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT SCAN:
FINDINGS: A limited examination of the porta hepatis and
peripancreatic
region was performed. No enlarged lymph nodes are seen.
Incidentally noted, but not fully evaluated, there is a round
hypoechoic
lesion within the left lobe of the liver. This lesion measures
1.3 x 1.5 x
1.3 cm.
IMPRESSION:
1. No lymphadenopathy identified.
2. Left hepatic lesion measuring 1.3 cm, which cannot be further

characterized with ultrasound. A multiphase CT could be
performed for better characterization when the patient is better
able to tolerate contrast.
.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN:
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: No pathologically enlarged axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes are observed. Small precarinal
and subcarinal lymph nodes measure up to 8 mm in short axis
which does not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. The
heart and great vessels are unremarkable and there is no
evidence of pericardial or pleural effusion. There is diffuse
ground-glass opacity throughout the lungs bilaterally, sparing
the subpleural lung, with a more nodular pattern predominating
in the upper lobes. The airways are patent to the subsegmental
level bilaterally.
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, and adrenal
glands appear
unremarkable. Wall thickening along the body and fundus of the
gallbladder
spares the gallbladder neck. Non-contrast evaluation of the
kidneys reveals a 7-mm nonobstructing right interpolar stone.
Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of normal
caliber and there is no pneumoperitoneum or free fluid.
Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the abdominal aorta,
otherwise of normal caliber.
CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid colon are
unremarkable. A Foley is present within the bladder. Bone
windows reveal innumerable small lucent lesions throughout all
visualized osseous structures. A healing right seventh rib
fracture is noted anterolaterally. No vertebral compression
deformities are observed.
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings most consistent with multiple myeloma with
innumerable lucent
lesions seen throughout all visualized osseous structures.
2. Diffuse ground glass and partially nodular opacities
throughout both lungs is a nonspecific finding, though raises
concern for an atypical infection; pulmonary edema alone is felt
less likely.
3. No lymphadenopathy.
.

SKELETAL SURVEY:
1. No obvious lucent lesions identified radiographically.
However, the torso CT obtained the same day shows innumerable
small lytic foci which are consistent with myeloma. Please see
report of that exam. Subtle scalloping along left femoral
diaphysis lateral cortex is of equivocal clinical significance.
2. Diffuse pulmonary parenchymal opacities which require further
evaluation. Again, please see contemporaneous CT report.
3. Degenerative changes in the spine.
4. Aortic calcification, unusual in someone of this age.
