Cardiac Cath [**2157-10-6**]:
COMMENTS:
  1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system
revealed single vessel CAD. The LMCA had no angiographically
visible
flow limiting lesions. The LAD had an ostial 100% stenosis. The
LCX had
no angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions and gave rise
to a
large OM1 branch. The RCA was a large dominant vessel and had no

angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures and hypotension requiring dopamine consistent with
cardiogenic
shock.
3. Acute anterolateral STEMI with total occlusion of ostial LAD.

4. Successful resuscitation at outside hospital from venticular
fibrillation cardiac arrest.
5. Successful primary PCI of the LAD with a 3.0 x 23 mm Cypher
DES,
post-dilated with a 3.25 mm balloon, and rescue of the D1 with a
3.25 mm
balloon.
6. Successful IABP placement through the RFA arteriotomy site.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Angiographic evidence of single vessel coronary artery
disease.
2. Elevated left and right sided filling pressures and
hypotension.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PCI of
the
LAD.
.
Echocardiogram [**2157-10-7**]:
Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately
depressed. Anterior, septal, apical akinesis is present.
2. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
40 yo M previously healthy other than asthma, with STEMI in
hospital v-fib arrest, found to have 1 vessel proximal LAD
disease s/p cypher stent, with IABP and pressors for cardiogenic
shock.
.
1. Anterior MI/coronaries:
The pt was diagnosed with STEMI based on enzymes, symptoms and
very suggestive ECG. He was admitted from outside hospital and
taken immediately to cardiac cath where occluded proximal LAD
was stented with Cypher stent. The pt developed cardiogenic
shock and required balloon pump and pressors for HD#1 and 2. By
hospital day #3, the pt was extubated, hemodynamically stable
off pressors, and was transferred from the ICU to the step down
floor. The following morning, he was fully awake and with stable
blood pressure, without CP or SOB.
-ASA, plavix, integrilin, IABP, cycle CE, Echo at bedside shows
diffuse HK, will get formal Echo in am
.
2. Rhythm:
The pt was in NSR during the hospitalization. He had frequent
ectopy, which was most likely AIVR, although ischemic NSVT was
also possible. He was treated with amiodarone, since he had an
episode of V-fib arrest at OSH. This was d/c'ed prior to
hospital discharge.
.
3. Respiratory:
The pt was intubated during code at OSH. He never had
oxygenation difficulty during hospitalization. He was extubated
after balloon pump was d/c'ed. Albuterol inhaler and fluticasone
were used to help with mild SOB.
.
4. Witnessed Aspiration event at OSH:
levofloxacin empirically
.
5. Ppx: PPI, heparin, bowel reg
.
6. Access: IABP, venous sheath, PIV, aline
