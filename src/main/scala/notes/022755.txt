History of Present Illness:
75 yo M with Mantle cell lymphoma (on bendamustine and Rituxan),
atrial flutter, tachy-CM (last EF 45-50%), recent UTI and
episode of urinary retention, prostate cancer s/p XRT [**2158**],
HTN/HL/DM who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for LE edema, is
presenting from [**Hospital1 1501**] for an evaluation of LE edema.

Of note, he was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 35870**] for LE edema
with was felt to be due to decreased lasix dose and
hypoalbuminemia (LENIs neg, no pelvic vein compression on CT
abd/pelv., TTE w/ mild worsening inferior hypokinesis).  Notably
his SBP ranged in 80s-100s without symptoms, felt to be due to
hypovolemia, excessive doses of ACEi and BB.  While on 80mg IV
lasix, BPs maintained in 80s.  He was treated for a positive UCx
with ciprofloxacin and notably was found to have urinary
retnetion, felt to be due to prostate ca s/p XRT. He was seen
for chemo treatment on [**5-21**], when his BP was 95/43.

Since [**Month/Year (2) **], patient has remained relatively hypotensive
while at rehabilitation, BPs as low as 80s systolic.  Over the
past week, noted urinary retention and dysuria.  On day of
transfer, c/o of increasing malaise and weakness, leg swelling
and heaviness, requiring the use of a wheelchair.  Of note, has
been diagnosed with a UTI on [**5-31**] (pseudomonas a.) and was
supposed to start treatment, however never initiated.  On day of
transfer, VS were 95/52 101 18 98, wa noted to have Wt of 186,
3lbs up from day prior, he received an increased dose of lasix,
80mg PO.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.5 62 100/40 18 92 on ? NC.
Patient's labs were notable for WBC of 5.6K with 10% bands, HCT
of 28, Plt of 180K, lactate of 2.3, positive UA, troponin of
0.03.  ECG showed NSR with RBBB and old inferior MI; no evidence
of acute ischemia or electrical alternans.  CXR showed
increasing L effusion and atelectasis.  Patient was given 500mg
IV of ciprofloxacin, however was noted to have decrease in his
BPs to 80s systolic, w/o response to 500cc NS bolus and 6mg IV
of Zofran.  He was then started on dopamine with improvement in
BPs to 130s systolic and tachycardia to 120s.  CVL was placed at
RIJ and patient was changed to levophed.  He underwent Bedside
US which showed moderate pericardial effusion, pulsus was not
checked.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 135 106/68 18 96% RA.

CXR [**2172-6-3**] 5:42 PM
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. Since
the prior
exam, there is interval increase in the left pleural effusion. A
small right
pleural effusion is redemonstrated. Bibasilar consolidations are
likely
attributable to compressive atelectasis. Overall, heart and
mediastinal
contours appear stable. Degenerative changes at the right
shoulder are
redemonstrated. Degenerative changes in the T-spine also again
seen.

IMPRESSION: Increasing left effusion. Persistent smaller right
effusion.
Compressive lower lobe atelectasis.
.
CXR [**2172-6-4**] 12:11 AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has
received a
right internal jugular vein catheter. Catheter is in normal
position and
course, the tip projects over the mid SVC.

In unchanged manner, there is moderate cardiomegaly with a
relatively
extensive left pleural effusion and a left atelectasis.

A newly appeared minimal right pleural effusion cannot be
excluded. No
evidence of pneumonia.

.
ECHO
Due to [**2172-6-4**] suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Very small pericardial effusion, without any
evidence of hemodynamic significance. Grossly preserved
biventricular systolic function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-4-13**],
the findings arppear similar, although inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis is not appreciated on today's focused study.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 yo M with Mantle cell lymphoma (on bendamustine and Rituxan),
atrial flutter, tachy-CM (last EF 45-50%), recent UTI and
episode of urinary retention, prostate cancer s/p XRT [**2158**] who
was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for LE edema, who presented from
[**Hospital1 1501**] for an evaluation of LE edema, urinary retention and
hypotension.

# Mantle cell lymphoma.  Reportedly improving with current chemo
prior to this. However, as hospitalization went on, became clear
that pleural effusions and pericardial effusions were malignant
in nature. [**Hospital1 3242**] service was following throughout. CT torso on
[**6-14**] showed worsening lymphoma. As a result, oncology started
Dexamethasone 20mg daily to arrest the lymphoma. MRI showed no
CNS disease. Persistent pressor requirement and unable to get
off vent (had been intubated for pericardiocentesis - see below)
with negative infectious work-up raised concern that all
problems stemming from overwhelming lymphoma. On [**6-18**] after 4
days of steroids with no response oncology met with family who
had expressed desires to not have prolonged intubation or life
support. Decision was made to pursue comfort-based goals of care
