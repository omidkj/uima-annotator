Studies:
[**2173-8-7**] CXR: No evidence of pneumonia. loss of the soft tissue
contour adjacent to the left clavicle, which may be suggestive
of supraclavicular lymphadenopathy or soft tissue swelling in
this location
.
[**2173-8-7**] EKG: Sinus rhythm
Left axis deviation
IV conduction defect
Anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined
Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Since previous tracing of [**2173-4-23**], anterior T wave inversion is
resolving
.
[**2173-8-9**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay. Probable old
anterior
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2173-8-8**] no change

.
Endoscopy: [**8-7**] - Grade 4 esophagitis; Mucosa suggestive of
Barrett's esophagus; Blood in the whole stomach; Medium hiatal
hernia
.
Endoscopy: [**8-10**]- Esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus
compatible with mild esophagitis; Esophageal ulcer; Mild
erythema in the antrum, fundus and stomach body compatible with
mild gastritis; Small hiatal hernia Otherwise normal EGD to
second part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
68 man with past medical history significant for CAD, CHF, DM,
ESRD not yet on HD, presented with 1 day of fatigue, melena X 1
found to have anemia to 21. Transferred from MICU with stable
hct in low 30's.

# Gastroenterology-
Patient presented with 1 episode of melena in the setting of
profound fatigue.  In the ED, he was found to have hct 21 (down
from basline of ~30)nasogastric lavage showed coffee grounds,
blood.  On Endoscopy he was found to have no active bleed,
gastritis, esophagitis, esophagial nonbledding ulcer, [**Last Name (un) **]
esophagus,hiatal hernia, and repeat Endoscopy confirmed same
thing. He was admitted to the Medical ICU and transfused
approximately 6 units of packed RBC, IV PPI, and sucralfate was
started.  Because patient has history of CAD, he was maintained
at a hematocrit to 30. Patient's hematocrit stabilized in the
low 30's and he was transferred to the floor in stable
condition.  While on the floor, patient had one episode of
melena, however, he was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit
continued to be in low 30's, Patient did not require an
