Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No mass/thrombus
in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Moderate AS (AoVA 1.0-1.2cm2) AR vena
contracta is <0.3cm. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) MR.


TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Mild PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass: Patient is A paced, on phyenylepherine and
epinepherine infusions (.02 mcg/kg/min). Global biventricular
function is unchanged. Septum appears mild- moderately
hypokinetic initally, improving over time to mild septal
hypokinesis. Other wall motion appears slightly improved. Mitral
regurg begins as 2+, then becomes trace. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve #21 is insitu wihtout perivalvular leaks or AI. Peak
gradient 19, mean 7 mm hg. Aortic contours intact. Remaing exam
is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time
of the exam.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
