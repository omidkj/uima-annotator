History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23**] is a 76 yo M with h/o CAD, CHF, a-fib, AVR, DM, HTN,
HLD, p/w one day of fever, rigor, nausea and vomiting. Pt felt
sudden onset rigor one day ago, with fever to 100, and BP
reportedly to 220/120 at home. He had some valium and was able
to sleep. He  Of note, pt did not have recent sickness, no
weight loss, night sweats. He did report some exercise
intolerance recently in the gym, which he attributed to
hypoglycemia. Of note, pt had a PCI with 2 drug eluting stents
placed in LAD and R-PDA. Pt had no recent dental work and never
had colonoscopy.

Pt went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] today, where he had VS: 102.1 HR: 101 BP:
123/49 Resp: 23 O(2)Sat: 100%. Lab showed WBC of 11.3 with 7%
Bands, INR 3.2, Cr 2.4, CK 1400, CK-MB 6, Trop 0.035; and
moderate hepatocellular transaminitis. Pt underwent noncontrast
CT-head, which did not reveal acute intracranial bleed. Blood
culture later grew GPC in pairs and clusters. Pt received 2L IVF
and one dose ceftriaxone / zosyn, and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **].
 In [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **], patient was switched to nafcillin once cultures

diminished significantly and his creatinine bumped. At this
time, the patient presented to our service.

Imaging:
Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2123-11-12**] Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch and complex atheroma n the descending thoracic
aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or
abscess seen. Normal functioning aortic valve bioprosthesis.
Mildly depressed left ventricular function. Mild spontaneous
echo contrast in the left atrium without evidence of thrombus in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2123-11-15**] CONCLUSION:
1. No finding to suggest acute vascular territorial infarct; in
this setting, MRI with DWI (if feasible) would be more
sensitive.
2. Evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. Chronic inflammatory disease involving the bilateral sphenoid
air cells
with superimposed acute inflammation involving the left sphenoid
air cell;
correlate clinically.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2123-11-17**]  IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the right
clinical
setting, less likely atelectasis.
2. No pulmonary vascular congestion.

RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2123-11-23**]  IMPRESSION: Normal renal
ultrasound. 2.4 cm exophytic left lower pole renal cyst.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2123-11-24**] IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema and
enlargement of still small layering bilateral pleural effusions.

2. Persistent retrocardiac opacification that could either
represent
atelectasis though pneumonia is also a possibility in the
correct clinical
setting.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) Study Date of [**2123-11-24**]  IMPRESSION: No
ileus or obstruction.
