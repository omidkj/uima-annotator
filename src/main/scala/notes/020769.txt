History of Present Illness:
50 y/o F with MMP including h/o gastric bypass, DVT/PE s/p IVC
filter [**11-23**], SLE on chronic prednisone, hypothyroidism, chronic
hypoventilation with PCO2 60s, adrenal insufficiency presents to
ED today for request of pain meds.  Pt was recently admitted to
[**Hospital 4199**] hospital from [**Date range (1) 33651**] after presenting with
unresponsiveness and respiratory failure requiring intubation.
Per d/c summary from [**Name (NI) 4199**], pt was admitted with resp failure,
intubated, admitted to the ICU, and then quickly extubated.  She
was treated for COPD with IV antibiotics, IV solumedrol, and
nebulizer treatments.  The pt had attributed her respiratory
failure to seroquel and thus, seroquel was discontinued.  The
patient was discharged on only Klonapin 0.5 PO BID, and per d/c
summary, was strongly recommended not to have extra pain and
anti-anxiety medications pescribed since they have caused
significant lethargy and loss of respiratory drive.  During her
hospital stay, pt was found to have a UTI on [**10-21**] (d/c summary
does not state what she was treated with), resp cx with +MRSA
(unclear if this was treated or thought to be colonized), blood
cxs NGTD.  Pt was also placed on steroid taper of Prednisone 20
mg to continue for one week and then plan was to taper to 10 mg
daily (unclear when IV solumedrol was d/ced at OSH, ?[**10-27**]).
.
Pt presents to ED today for request of pain and anxiety
medications for abdominal pain and anxiety.  Pt reports that her
doctor took all of her pain medications and that she has been
having "wicked" pain since then with increased anxiety.  Pt also
reports throat pain/soreness after recent intubation and
extubations.  Denies fevers/chills, headache, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abd pain, dysuria, no change in BMs, no LE
swelling.  Of note, pt has been having continual oozing from G
tube site which has been out for last 2 months per last note
from GI.
.
In [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] staff had discussion with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: chronic pain issues
and after discussion with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6431**] as well as NH physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that pt could be re-started on Klonapin
0.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] as well as Methadone 5 mg TID.  Labs in ED were drawn
and found to have Na of 127 (baseline 133-136 on last d/c,
although has been as low as 127) and K of 5.7, repeat 5.8.  EKG
with NSR at 96 bpm and +peaked T waves.  Pt was given 10 units
regular insulin IV +1 amp D50, Kayexylate 30 gm PO, Ca gluconate
2 gm IV x 1, also hydrated with 1 L NS.  Also given Klonapin 0.5
mg PO and Methadone 5 mg PO, tums.  Repeat EKG at 6 pm with
still peaked T waves.  Pt was then admitted to medicine service
for further treatment of hyperkalemia.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 y/o female with MMP including chronic pain, COPD s/p
recent intubation for ?hypercarbic respiratory failure
attributed to benzo/narcotic use, SLE on chronic prednisone,
remote h/o adrenal insufficiency, depression/anxiety, h/o DVT/PE
with IVC filter presenting with hyperkalemia, EKG changes,
hyponatremia. The patient was initially admitted to the medical
service who, in discussion with the ED and the patient's PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] the patient on Methadone 5 TID and Klonopin 0.5. The
patient recieved a total of methadone 10 and klonopin 0.5 when
she had a respiratory arrest with a max PCO2 of 132. She was
emergently intubated and sent to the MICU. There, she was
slightly hypotensiove requiring a small amount of dopamine. She
was weaned off the vent, and transfred to the floor on no
narcotics or benzos.
.
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: She has a baseline hypercarbia
secondary to likely COPD (although past PFT's unrevealing with
poor effort) with extensive smoking history, but also has
diagnosis of hypoventilation sydrome.  She had an acute on
chronic exacerbation of this hypercarbic respiratory failure,
most likely secondary to hypoventilation,  as she had normal A-a
gradient and clinical syndrome of  decreased level of
consciousness and bradypnea in the setting  of re-initiating her
methadone and clonopin.  She will follow up in pulmonary clinic
to have a outpainett sleep study since she may have central
sleep apnea. She was also started on BiPap overnight at 8/5 and
tolerated it well. Recommend to avoid ALL BENZOS AND PAIN MEDS!!


Hyperkalemia on admission: unclear etiology; no K sparing
medications. No renal insufficency.  Possibly adrenal
insufficiency in her clinical context.  She was given
insulin/d50/calcium/kayexalate in ED for K of 5.8 and peaked T
waves.  Her
potassium is now normal. She recevied stress dose steroids in
the MICU and then was changed to her standing prednisone 20mg po
qd.

Methicillin Resistent Staph Epi Bacteremia: Unclear where the
source is from. Blood cultures positive for MRSE on [**11-4**]. She
was started on Vancomycin. ESR is only 3 so unlikely
endocarditis or osteomyelitis. TTE negative for vegetetations.
Vancomycin iv per PICC line x 14 day course started on [**11-4**].

EColi Urinary Tract Infection. Sensitive to bactrim, but patient
is allergic. Treated with Macrobid x 7 days.

Chronic Abdominal pain and anxiety: Psychiatry saw the patient
for anxiety. We h
