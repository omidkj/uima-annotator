was called and felt this was most consistent with ETOH
withdrawal. Patient was given 5mg of Diazepam. 1L of Banana bag,

IMAGING:
CXR [**2136-5-14**] - FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable. There is no focal pulmonary consolidation or
pleural effusion. There is thoracic kyphosis with multilevel
degenerative changes in the spine.
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
Head CT [**2136-5-14**] - FINDINGS: The scan is somewhat compromised due
to artifact from motion, within these limitations the midline
structures are central. There is no mass effect or edema. There
is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. The visualized paranasal
sinuses are clear. CONCLUSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
Abd CT [**2136-5-14**] - CONCLUSION: 1. 3-mm nodule at the right lung
base should be followed up with a chest CT in one year to ensure
resolution/stability.
2. 6.5 mm dilated pancreatic duct with multiple punctate
pancreatic
calcifications. These findings are most consistent with sequelae
of
pancreatitis; however IPMN cannot be excluded. Further
evaluation with MRCP should be performed as clinically
indicated. 3. Bilateral pars defects at L5.

Brief Hospital Course:
ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: This is a 59 yo M who presents with
altered mental status and concern for ETOH withdrawal based on
prior h/o ETOH per report. Tox screen was negative on admission
and patient was started on CIWA and given MVI/folate/thiamine.
Patient continued to be aggitated and was given diazepam and
haldol with good effect.  His mental status improved throughout
his ICU stay and patient was responsive and cooperative prior to
transfer to the general wards.  Upon transfer to wards, patient
was delerious and agitated, requiring additional haldol. Based
on prior admissions, psychiatry assessed mental status change
most likely due to benzodiazepene toxicity.  Vitals remained
stable and there was no evidence of ETOH withdrawal. Valium was
held and mental status changes resolved.

DIABETES: Pt is a known diabetic and his blood glucose was
stable during ICU stay.  Upon transfer to floors, his blood
sugar was difficult to control, ranging between 63 and >500. It
was eventually controlled with a reduced glargine dose and
sliding scale insulin. Patient is being discharged on 15 units
glargine QAM.

CHRONIC PANCREATITIS: Patient intermittently complained of
nonspecific abdominal pain. He tolerated PO with no nausea or
vomiting and abdominal exam was unremarkable. Upon discharge,
patient states pain is minimal.

INCIDENTAL PULMONARY NODULE: A pulmonary nodule was found on
imaging in the ED and should be re-imaged by CT in 1 year.

HYPERTENSION: Blood pressure well-controlled with home meds of
lisinopril 40mg PO Qdaily and Norvasc 10mg PO Qdaily.

ISSUES FOR FOLLOW-UP:
1. 3-mm nodule at the right lung base should be followed up with
a chest CT in one year to ensure resolution/stability.

2. 6.5 mm dilated pancreatic duct with multiple punctate
pancreatic calcifications. These findings are most consistent
with sequelae of pancreatitis; however IPMN cannot be excluded.
Further evaluation with MRCP should be performed as clinically
indicated.

3. [**Name (NI) 20472**] Pt was adjusting his insulin dose dramatically
without consulting a physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was told to take 15 units
glargine QAM and sugars should be closely monitored.
