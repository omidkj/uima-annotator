Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 87 year old right handed female with past
medical history of right MCA infarct with residual left
hemiparesis and neglect, atrial fibrillation with recent
discontinuation of coumadin for unclear reasons, hypertension,
history of seizures in setting of infections in past, who
presented to ED from [**Hospital3 **] home after a generalized
tonic clonic seizure.

Called Heathwood. Night nurse went to check on her early this
monring and witnessed a generalized tonic clonic seizure. Per
nursing home staff, she has had seizures in past in setting of
urinary infections. Unclear how long she had seized for. EMS
called. Per Heathwood staff, patient has had seizures before in
setting of UTIs. Vitals with BP 180/90, HR 170s, RR 28, 02 sat
89%. Put on 3L oxygen and sat up to 92%.

Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation. Vitals Temp 99.8, HR
140s
and irregular, BP 175/77, oxygen 99%. While in ED, initially
noted to be alert. Later, had second seizure with foaming, teeth

clenching, generalized convulsions . No witnesses to initial
onset. Treated with 2 mg Ativan and intubated for airway
protection after Lidocaine, Vecuronium, Fentanyl, Etomidate,
Succinylcholine. No length of seizure, but on order of minutes
per ED staff. Loaded with 1 gram Dilantin.

She became hypertensive and tachycardic during seizure.
Diltiazem
given for rate control. After Diltiazem and preintubation meds,
patient became transiently hypotensive. Volume resuscitated,
propofol turned off and given 2 gram Ceftriaxone and Flagyl. BP
high 60s to 90s from 8am to 9:15am.

Wet read of head CT by ED questioned hemorrhage. Neurosurgery
consulted. No bleeding noted on scan. They have signed off.


Seen by family yesterday. No complaints. No fevers, chills,
recent illness.

Admission head CT:
1. No acute infarctions identified. No intraaxial or extraaxial
masses or
hemorrhages.

2. Chronic right MCA territory infarct.

3. Mild cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.

ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion appear normal.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion

EEG:
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence of a
slow, low voltage background rhythm in the delta and mid theta
frequency
ranges. Generalized delta frequency slowing was also seen. These
findings suggest deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and are
consistent with an encephalopathy. Note was made of an irregular
neuro-complex tachycardia suggestive of rapid a-fib on the
cardiac
monitor. No epileptiform or clearly lateralizing abnormalities
were seen
in this recording.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo F with h/o large right MCA infarct [**2123**]
with residual hemiplegia, RAF, HTN, presenting with GTC x 2 (one

at NH, one witnessed in ED). Intubated for airway protection.
Patient non verbal, minimally responsive to noxious. Exam
notable
for stiff neck with [**Month (only) **] ROM, decreased withdrawal on left side
compared with right, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, clonus, upgoing
toes. Likely had GTC with old infarct as focus. However,
hypotension and lactate of 9.0 concerning for
