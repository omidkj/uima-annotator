Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] is a 41 yo woman with end stage AIDS, HIV
cardiomyopathy with last EF [**12-24**] <20%, and HIV nephropathy with
very low UOP and nephrotic range proteinuria who was
hospitalized in [**Month (only) 1096**] for 3 weeks with bibasilar pneumonia
for which she was given a 2 week course of levo/flagyl.  She was
discharged with stable LE edema and on an HIV salvage regimen
consisting of 5 HAART meds.  She returned to the hospital one
day after discharge complaining of possible increased LE edema,
which was found to be unchanged from prior on exam.  She seemed
to feel "unsafe" at home but was unable to elaborate on that.
Cultures from previous hospitalization returned at that time
with [**Doctor First Name **] in sputum and stool and she was started on treatment.
.
Five days after admission, the patient was prepared for
discharge to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with HIV specialty floor, when she complained
of new onset SOB, RR 30s-40s x hours, and eventual hypoxia.  ABG
revealed lactic acidosis with lactate of 16 and ph of 7.19.  FS
at that time was 24. This was all believed to be lactic acidosis
caused by HIV meds (zidovudine) interfering with mitochrondrial
function.  She recieved 1 amp NaHCO3, 1 amp D50 and 500 cc NS
bolus.
.
She was transferred to the ICU, where she required CVVH for
lactic acidosis and D10 for hypoglycemia.  She developed
multi-system organ failure, including liver failure, increased
oliguria, pancreatitis, and hemolysis.  She responded well to
CVVH and after family meeting CVVH was discontinued and decision
was made not to restart dialysis of any sort even if her lactic
acidosis were to recur.  She was treated with aztreonam and
vanco by levels for bilateral pneumonia.  The patient expressed
an interest in going to hospice.  A palliative care consult was
ordered and pt was transferred to floor.
.
The patient's 13 year old daughter is not aware of her mother's
HIV status and the patient has not been forthcoming about her
current prognosis.  A family meeting with the patient, Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) 31478**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 31479**] social worker [**Name (NI) 30513**], the patient's
daughter [**Name (NI) 31480**], her daughter's cousin, and Ms. [**Known lastname 31476**]
sister-in-law. At this meeting the family was updated on the
patient's generally poor prognosis. The pt decided that she
would like to go to hospice, and understood the goals of
hospice. The pt was seen by Palliative care and she was placed
in a hospice of her choice. The pt stated she would like to
complete the course of PO antibiotics which were started in the
MICU. Her central line was pulled, uneventfully, on the day of
discharge. The patient was discharged on cefpodoxime and
azithromycin for 4 days to complete her course of antibiotics
for pneumonia. The pt will be continued on her digoxin for heart
failure, ipratropium nebulizer for shortness of breath, Bactrim
for PCP prophylaxis, [**Name9 (PRE) 31481**] for hyperphosphatemia secondary to
renal failure and lasix for shortness of breath and painful
lower extremity edema.
.
The pt reported that she will inform her family of the tranfer
to the hospice facility. Her brother was present for this
conversation.
