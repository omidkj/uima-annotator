CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Motor vehicle accident.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
male with a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea and
coronary artery disease who was admitted on [**2131-5-23**],
after a motor vehicle accident with a head laceration.  The
patient endured seventh and eighth rib fractures on the left
and a seventh rib fracture on the right and a loss of
consciousness.  The patient reports that he may fallen asleep
at the wheel of the car.  The patient was initially found to
have a left pleural effusion in addition to some fluid
surrounding his liver and was admitted to the surgical floor
for observation.  During his admission an initial
electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation that
autoconverted to sinus rhythm.  This was his first episode of
atrial fibrillation, according to history of the patient.
Electrophysiology was consulted and performed an
echocardiogram which showed normal ejection fraction with
evidence of diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary
hypertension with severe left ventricular hypertrophy and 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient did have an increase in
troponin levels but Cardiology felt this was secondary to
cardiac contusion as opposed to acute coronary syndrome.  On
[**5-28**] the patient returned to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit because of a desaturation of his oxygen to the 80's on
two to three liters of nasal cannula.  An arterial blood gas
at this time showed a pH of 7.28, a pCO2 of 81 and a paO2 of
245.  The patient was put on noninvasive ventilation with a
resulting blood gas of 7.30, 68 and 146.  Chest x-ray at this
time showed increased bilateral effusions.  A left
thoracentesis was therefore performed with a white blood cell
count of 278, red blood cell count of 8,667, protein of 2.7,
LDH 160, consistent with a transudative process.  The patient
continued to remain on noninvasive ventilation with a
pressure support of 14 and a PEEP of 5 with gases in the
range of pH of 7.33, pCO2 of 57 to 62 and paO2 of 144 to 157.
He continued to have oxygen saturations from 90 to 100%.
When the patient was switched to 50% oxygen face mask, his
oxygen saturations decreased to 80%.  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management
of his respiratory distress as they were unable to wean him
from the noninvasive ventilation in the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 620**] with his wife.
The patient has a very remote and very minimal tobacco
history.  Denies alcohol use.  Denies illicit drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
Temperature 97 degrees, heart rate 64, blood pressure 133/45,
respiratory rate 21, oxygen saturation 100%.  The patient was
on noninvasive ventilation with a pressure support of 15, a
PEEP of 5, 50% FiO2.  He was bringing in tidal volumes of 350
cc with a respiratory rate of 25 and a minute ventilation of
8.6.  His arterial blood gas was 7.34, 64 and 96.  In
general, the patient looked comfortable on his noninvasive
ventilation.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the
pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
The sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx was dry.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart was a
regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops were noted.  Abdomen was soft, non-tender,
non-distended with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities showed
no signs of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  The skin showed no
rash

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION TO UNIT:  White blood cell count
14.2, hematocrit 28.7, platelet count 639.  Sodium 146,
potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 34, BUN 51, creatinine
1.6 and glucose of 112.  His ionized calcium was 1.12,
magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 4.6, lactic acid 0.7.  Pleural
fluid chemistries from [**5-28**] were white blood cells [**Pager number **],
red blood cells 8,667 with 32% polymorphonuclear lymphocytes.
Total protein 2.7, glucose 139, LDH 160.  Urinalysis:
Specific gravity 1.017, large amount of blood, negative
nitrite, 100 protein, pH 5.0, negative leukocyte esterase,
greater than 50 red blood cells, [**1-31**] white blood cells, no
bacteria.  The patient's tox screen was negative.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray from [**5-30**] showed decreased
effusions, continued congestive heart failure with perihilar
opacification and CT of the chest from [**5-23**] showed a
large left pleural effusion with a small right pleural
effusion, cardiac enlargement, left lower lobe atelectasis,
increased opacity in the left upper lobe suspicious for
contusion.  Patchy areas of ground glass opacity in the right
upper lobe anteriorly.  Atelectasis, as stated, with smaller
right-sided effusions.  Small irregularly shaped nodules 6 mm
in right apex.  CT of the abdomen showed an enlarged spleen
with a small perisplenic fluid collection and large
gallstones in the gallbladder.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory failure:  The patient exhibited hypoxic and
hypercapnic respiratory failure of unclear etiology.  Hypoxic
respiratory failure improved with diuresis.  The patient was
diuresed with Lasix and Natrecor to a total of negative five
liters which seemed to improve his congestive heart failure
by chest x-ray and by physical examination and seemed to
improve his hypoxic respiratory failure.  Many factors were
considered to be at play in his hypercapnic respiratory
failure including congestive heart failure from diastolic
dysfunction causing large bilateral pleural effusions with
some pulmonary edema, muscle weakness and likely obstructive
sleep apnea with some central hypoventilation syndrome.
ABG's were obtained q. 3h. to evaluate the patient's acid
base status on and off noninvasive ventilation in addition to
awake and asleep.  The patient's pH ranged from 7.4 to 7.32
and his pCO2 ranged from 55 to 82 though there did not seem
to be much of a correlation between whether he was on
noninvasive ventilation and whether he was on face mask.  It
is most likely that the patient's hypercapnia is due to his
obstructive sleep apnea and, thus, treating the obstructive
sleep apnea is the best way to address this problem.
Therefore, the patient was started on continuous positive
airway pressure ventilation overnight with a pressure of 8
starting on [**6-10**].  As the patient began to wake up and
become less somnolent he also began to refuse his full face
mask for noninvasive ventilation, however, he did do quite
well on two liter nasal cannula for most of the day.  The
patient was at many times noted to be extremely somnolent and
unresponsive, however, his somnolence did not correlate with
his pCO2 levels, therefore, it was thought not to be due to
hypercapnic toxicity but due to his obstructive sleep apnea
and extremely large sleep deficit.  In addition, the patient
was noted to have a metabolic alkalosis thought to be
secondary to c
