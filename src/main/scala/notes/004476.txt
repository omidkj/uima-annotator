Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness/slurred speech

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old right-handed woman with a
history
of HTN, hyperlipidemia who presents with acute onset dysarthria
and left-sided weakness.

She was last seen normal by her grandson at 3:30 AM. He took a
nap, and when he awoke at
about 4 AM, he found her on the couch speaking incomprehensibly.
He thought she was moving her left side less. He didn't notice
any other deficits. He called 911, and EMS brought her to [**Hospital1 18**].

Code Stroke was called at 5:04 AM. Neurology Resident was at the
bedside by 5:09 AM.

Initial NIH Stroke Scale (begun at 5:11 AM) score was 17:
1a. Level of Consciousness: 0
1b. LOC Question: 1 (incorrect month)
1c. LOC Commands: 0
2. Best gaze: 2 (forced deviation to right)
3. Visual fields: 2 (left homonymous hemianopia)
4. Facial palsy: 1 (left NLF flattening)
5a. Motor arm, left: 4 (no movement)
5b. Motor arm, right: 0
6a. Motor leg, left: 4
6b. Motor leg, right: 1 (drift)
7. Limb Ataxia: 0
8. Sensory: 1 (loss of light touch in left arm)
9. Language: 0
10. Dysarthria: 1 (mild)
11. Extinction and Neglect: 2 (profound neglect of left side,
extinction to DSS with both tactile and visual input)
TOTAL: 17

She was taken emergently to the CT scanner, where evidence of a
Right M1 occlusion was seen. There was no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage.

On return from CT, she showed some clinical improvement. Her
repeat NIH Stroke Scale (begun at 5:45 AM) score was 5:
1a. Level of Consciousness: 0
1b. LOC Question: 0
1c. LOC Commands: 0
2. Best gaze: 0
3. Visual fields: 2 (left homonymous hemianopia)
4. Facial palsy: 0
5a. Motor arm, left: 0
5b. Motor arm, right: 0
6a. Motor leg, left: 1 (drift)
6b. Motor leg, right: 0
7. Limb Ataxia: 0
8. Sensory: 1 (loss of light touch in left arm)
9. Language: 0
10. Dysarthria: 0 (mild)
11. Extinction and Neglect: 2 (profound neglect of left side,
extinction to DSS with both tactile and visual input)
TOTAL: 5

As she had become oriented, further history was obtained from
her
directly. She recalls going into the kitchen to make breakfast
at
3:30 AM (which is routine for her). She does not have a specific
recall of the onset of her symptoms. In fact, she was unaware of
having anything wrong, and says she came to the hospital because
her grandson said she was slurring her speech.

She denies having a history of intracranial or subarachnoid
hemorrhage; she denies any neurosurgery, head trauma, and prior
stroke; she denies a history of internal bleeding; and she
denies
a history of intracranial neoplasm or vascular malformation.

On neuro ROS, she reports a headache, but still denies having
any
other deficit, including loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, she denies recent fever or chills.

No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough,
shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Because she still had significant deficits and had evidence of
occlusion on CT, tPA at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg was administered (61
kg; 6 mg given as IV push, 55 mg infused over 60 minutes).

organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 2+ radial, DP pulses

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3. Able to relate the events
she was a part of but is not able to site reason for coming to
hospital. Mildly inattentive, able to name DOW backward to
Tuesday. Language is fluent with intact repetition and
comprehension.  Normal prosody.  There were no paraphasic
errors.
Pt. was able to name both high and low frequency objects. Unable
to read either due to neglect of hemianopsia. Speech was mildly
dysarthric. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands. Pt. was able to register 3 objects and recall [**1-26**] at 5
minutes.  She had modest knowledge of current events. There was
evidence of left hemi-neglect. Significant anosognosia.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 3 to 1mm and brisk. Left homonymous hemianopia by
visual threat. Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema,
exudates, or hemorrhages.
III, IV, VI: Forced rightward eye deviation (returned, after
having apparently resolved immediately after CT scan).
V: Facial sensation intact to pinprick.
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric.
VIII: Hearing intact to voice bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.

[**1-16**]: CTH: noncontrast head without evidence of acute ich.
[**1-16**]:CTA demonstrates apparent filling defect in right mca
(3:212, 213) concerning for thrombus.

[**1-16**]: MRA: Focal area of narrowing and signal loss near the
bifurcation of right middle cerebral artery, indicative of a
thrombus seen on the earlier CT.
MRI: Findings indicative of acute infarct in the distribution of
right middle cerebral artery.

Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
