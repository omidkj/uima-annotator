Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred from an outside
hospital for mental status changes, acute renal failure,
hyperkalemia, and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
female with a long history of coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure, and arrhythmias, who found down in
her home by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] the outside hospital records,
the husband noticed mental status changes for approximately
two weeks and occasional dyspnea.  It was not known at the
time she was admitted, but later it was learned that the
patient had been taking Aldactone starting approximately two
weeks ago at the time that her mental status changes began to
occur.  The patient was found on the floor outside of her
bathroom, apparently just after she stood from the toilet.

She was brought to the Emergency Room with a systolic blood
pressure of 80, with no response to 2 liters of fluid in the
Emergency Room.  She was found to have a potassium of 6.9, a
BUN 53, and creatinine 2.9; although, her baseline is a
creatinine of 1.  She was noted to have  wide complex QRS on
her electrocardiogram, was mildly obtunded, and was placed on
dopamine at 4.5 mcg/min for pressure support.  Her right
upper quadrant was noted to be painful on physical
examination.  Laboratories there were notable for a
bicarbonate of 18, flat creatine kinases, and elevated
digoxin level at 2.5, an INR greater than 7.5, and a
hematocrit of 29.  A head CT was performed to rule out
cerebrovascular accident.  This was limited by artifact, but
was negative for acute processes.  A rushed echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of approximately 25%.  At the
outside hospital she was given D-50 and insulin times two,
and Kayexalate p.o. and p.r. for her hyperkalemia, as well as
2 units of packed red blood cells for a slightly low
hematocrit of 29.7, and 2 units fresh frozen plasma, as well
as vitamin K for her elevated INR, then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].

Upon arrival, the patient complains of right upper quadrant
pain on and off which lasts five minutes at a time, is dull,
is rated [**3-28**] in intensity, and possibly occurs more often
after meals.  She reports that Tylenol helps this pain.  She
also complains of diarrhea times one month, ultimately loose
and watery, as well as specks of bright red blood in her
stool, but no melena, hematemesis, nausea or vomiting.  She
does report a slight decrease in her appetite and p.o.
intake, but does report food fluid intake and increased
thirst.  She thinks she may have increased her intake of
salty foods recently.  She has been Imodium for her diarrhea.
The rest of her review of systems was remarkable for the
absence of chest pain and palpitations, the presence of
shortness of breath for approximately three weeks,
three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea two
weeks ago, and increased lower extremity edema for several
weeks.  She has had no change in her weight but has not
checked this precisely.  She denies fevers, chills, and night
sweats, rash, genitourinary complaints.

Regarding her fall, she has recollection of the actual event,
but says that she probably lost consciousness.  She reports
leg pain prior to the event, and is unable to clarify clearly
beyond saying that they were weak (left greater than right).

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Significant for)
 1.  Myocardial infarction in [**2120**] which led to cardiogenic
shock and a new left bundle-branch block.  She was
catheterized at that time and had a stent placed to her
proximal left circumflex, and distal right coronary artery
was occluded to 100% at that time.  She had an episode of
ventricular tachycardia post myocardial infarction which
required lidocaine, and an episode of atrial fibrillation
which required DC cardioversion.
 2.  She had a coronary artery bypass graft in [**2120**] which
included a left internal mammary artery to her left anterior
descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to her first
obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to a posterior
descending artery, as well as mitral valve repair.
 3.  She had a follow-up catheterization in [**2123**] which showed
2-vessel disease with a totally occluded left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery graft as
well as a totally occluded saphenous vein graft to first
obtuse marginal, and saphenous vein graft to right posterior
descending artery graft.  The catheterization also showed
severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction bilaterally, and
moderate pulmonary hypertension, and moderate-to-severe
mitral regurgitation.
 4.  Therefore, she had a follow-up coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2123**] and had a saphenous vein graft to her left
anterior descending artery and her first diagonal and her
first obtuse marginal, as well as a mitral valve replacement
with mechanical valve.
 5.  She had a pacemaker placed in [**2123**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**].
This pacemaker is a Prodigy DR7860B, atrial lead 4068,
ventricular lead 4024; it is a DDD-type pacer.
 6.  She also has had an atrial flutter ablation in [**2124**], and
atrial flutter DC cardioversion in [**2124-11-18**], and
atrial fibrillation DC cardioversion in [**2126-4-19**].
 7.  Stress MIBI in [**2125-11-19**] which showed severe
inferolateral defects, now fixed in contrast to an [**2121-11-19**] study where they were reversible.
 8.  In [**2125-1-17**], the patient had an echocardiogram
which showed a dilated left ventricular global hypokinesis
and akinesis including the right ventricle, significant
mitral regurgitation over her valve prosthesis, significant
tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and
interval decreased function since her last study with an
ejection fraction of less than 20%.
 9.  Hypertension.
10.  Type 2 diabetes with the last hemoglobin A1c of 8.4 in
[**2126-1-17**].  Hemoglobin A1c were as high as 11.
11.  Hypercholesterolemia.
12.  Peripheral vascular disease with a claudication and the
requirement that she occasionally have catheterizations by
brachial artery.
13.  Depression.
14.  Dysfunction uterine bleeding with a thick endometrium
noticed on a [**2125-11-19**] ultrasound.
15.  Obesity.
16.  Allergic rhinitis.
17.  Recent admissions to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) 7941**] of her INR and for an atrial fibrillation
cardioversion.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was difficult to obtain, but
was negative for coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 70-pack-year history; now
smokes five cigarettes a day.  Does not drink alcohol.  Takes
no drugs.  Lives with her husband.

ALLERGIES:  CECLOR causes hives.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  See History of Present Illness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  On physical examination
vitals were temperature of 97.6, pulse 60, blood
pressure 93/34 (on 3 mcg/min of dopamine), respirations 18,
saturation 98% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general, this
was a tired, obese female in no acute distress with slightly
inappropriate and delayed answers to questions.
Cardiovascular showed a regular rate and rhythm, a
mechanical-sounding S1, and a holosystolic murmur throughout
her precordium.  No rubs or gallops.  HEENT examination
showed jugular venous distention to the angle of her jaw at
45 degrees.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact.  Oropharynx showed
slightly dry mucous membranes.  She had cavities bilaterally.
She was normocephalic and atraumatic from her fall.
