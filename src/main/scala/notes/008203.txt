Chief Complaint:
Cough, fever, increased sputum production

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular Venous Catheter
Cosyntropin Stimulation Test

History of Present Illness:
HPI: [**Age over 90 **] yo female w/ [**Hospital 10224**] medical problems presents with
hypercarbic resp failure requiring intubation in the ED. Pt
presented w/ 3 day h/o SOB then acute worsening on day of
admission. Unclear if she had any recent fevers. She did
complain of a productive cough productive cough. Denied any
orthopnea, PND.
*
Pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2156-1-6**] for Influenza A
PNA and sepsis requiring intubation and pressors and complicated
by malignant HTN, hyponatremia, CHF exacerbation. Also had
amarosis fugax but with CT with no acute changes, felt to be
high risk, but didn't start coumadin because of known history of
falls.
*
In the ED [**2-29**], he went into hypercarbic respiratory failure and
was intubated. Chest xray showed retrocardiac density, and so
she was started on cefepime/ vancomycin for presumed
ventilator-associated pneumonia given recent hopitalization for
Influenza. Started on dopamine for hypotension which was changed
to levophed. Was extubated morning of [**3-2**] and ocntinued on
levophed for support of hypotension. Transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU to West ICU given bed availability.

1) Persistent congestive failure.
2) Persistent opacity at the left base as described.
3) Possible pneumomediastinum. Per discussion with the resident
caring for the patient, the patient has not undergone a
procedure since the prior exam.

Microbiology:
[**2156-2-29**]: Blood Culture: No Growth to Date (as of [**3-2**])

SPUTUM GRAM STAIN (Final [**2156-3-2**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).

ECHO: [**2156-3-3**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+)
aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2156-1-7**],
significant
aortic valve gradient was not detected in the prior study
(probably due to  suboptimal Doppler study).

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P [**Age over 90 **] yo with nosocomial pneumonia/CHF leading to respiratory
failure and resulting sepsis, resolved s/p extubation.
*
1. Sepsis. On admission, pt intubated in ED, started on dopamine
for hypotension  and sent to MICU on levophed. Felt that patient
likely developed bronchopneumonia with resulting CHF in setting
of tachycardia - resulting in hypercarbic respiratory fl.
Dopamine was changed to levophed given persistent tachycardia.
Patient diuresed while in unit and she was successfully
extubated on [**3-2**] but remained on pressors transiently given
hypotension - which resolved s/p blood transfusion on [**3-3**].
Patient stablized in MICU and transferred to floor on [**3-4**]. On
floor, held off on aggresive IVF given that she is extubated and
presented with CHF, but will also held off on diuresis as
already diuresed well. No other clear etiology of hypotension.
SBP up to 140's and metoprolol restarted [**3-8**]. Pt had negative
[**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test so no role for steroids during admission. Of
note, ECHO [**12-12**] with LVEF 55%, mildly dilated LV, mod dilation
of bilateral atria, Mild As and [**1-11**]+AR, 1+MR, moderate pulm HTN

*
2. Nosocomial [**Name (NI) 10227**] Pt presented w/ fevers, increasing
sputum production. CXR w/ retrocardiac density. Was intially on
levo/vanc, but given GNR in sputum gram stain, she was
originally continued on cefepime for Gram negative coverage.
Rpt CXR w/ slight increase in CHF. Sputum cx from [**3-2**] growing
MRSA, therefore pt abx were again changed to vancomycin and
levoquin - levoquin was used given initial concern for GNR in
sputum. Given severity of respiratory failure/sepsis and
possibility of vent associated pna, will cont full course of
levoquin. Unclear etiology of MRSA, however pt with recent
hospitalization with INFLUENZA A and PNA and was d/ced at that
time to [**Hospital3 4419**]. WIll cont both abx for 14 day
course with last dose on [**3-18**]. Will dose vanc 1gm q24hrs as
troughs were <5 initially.  HER LAST DOSE OF VANCOMYCIN WAS at
6pm ON [**3-8**]. GIVEN THAT VANC LEVEL on [**3-9**] is 11, PLEASE GIVE
ANOTHER DOSE OF VANC TONIGHT. Given that am vanc levels are
persistently low, consider daily dosing (with daily trough level
checks) although creatinine clearance would suggest less dosing
needed - or may dose according to level by getti
