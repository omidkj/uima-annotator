Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
pelvic fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26585**] is a French Creole speaking [**Age over 90 **] M with recent
pelvic fracture who developed aspiration pneumonia and now is
admitted to the ICU with hypoxia. He was saturating well on the
medical floor until 2 days ago when he had an aspiration event
and became slightly hypoxic. This morning, his hypoxia
progressed to the point that he needed high flow face mask to
maintain sats of 96%. Since his chest x ray was unchanged, it
was hypothesized that his new A-a gradient was due to a
pulmonary embolism. A CTA cannot be obtained because of the
patient's renal failure and a V/Q scan would not be useful since
his baseline CXR shows infiltrates. He was hemodynamically
stable at time of transfer.

Past Medical History:
diabetes II, hep B and hep C

Social History:
He has been a preacher for several years.  He has been in the
U.S. for 23 years and is a citizen. He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]

.
CT pelvis [**11-13**]: 7 x 4 cm right iliacus hematoma likely
secondary to small nondisplaced right iliac bone fracture.
2.Superior and inferior right pubic rami fractures. 3. Ascites
and soft tissue third spacing, a moderate left and small right
pleural effusions. 4. Multiple hypodense renal lesions, likely
cysts, the smallest too small to
definitively characterize.
.
CXR [**11-21**]: A new consolidation is seen in the right lower lung
having relatively sharp contours with elevation of right
hemidiaphragm and downward displacement of the right hila, most
likely representing new atelectasis. Underlying infectious
process cannot be excluded based on this chest radiograph. The
left retrocardiac atelectasis and left pleural effusion are
unchanged. There is no evidence of failure or pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**11-14**]: EF 70-75%. The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular  chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26585**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male admitted after a fall
resulting in pelvic fracture with subsequent development of a
multi-lobar pneumonia and fluid overload with bilateral pleural
effusions and total body edema.
.
His pneumonia was treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and
clindamycin given unclear source of pulmonary infiltrate. For
volume overload, he received furosemide intravenously as needed
and he diuresed appropriately. However, throughout his stay he
required an increased amount of oxygen and was on 100%
non-rebreather at the time of discharge. Culture data was
pending at the time of discharge. After extensive discussion
with the family and patient regarding prognosis, it was decided
that he would go home with hospice. The patient wished this and
the family was in agreement.
