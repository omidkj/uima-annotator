2.  End-stage renal disease status post cadaveric kidney
transplant.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Retinopathy.
6.  Neuropathy.
7.  Charcot's foot.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes:
1.  Cadaveric renal transplantation on [**2146-7-23**] on
steroid-free protocol.
2.  Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Prograf.
2.  ____________
3.  Bactrim.
4.  Nystatin.
5.  Protonix.
6.  Colace.
7.  Lopressor.
8.  Avandia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient was afebrile and his vital
signs were stable.  He was satting at 100% on two liters
nasal cannula.  Generally, he was alert and oriented times
three with moderate distress.  His HEENT examination showed a
normocephalic, atraumatic male with pupils equal and reactive
to light and accommodation and the sclerae anicteric.  Neck
supple without lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous
distention.  Cardiac was a regular rate and rhythm with no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Respiratory was clear to
auscultation bilaterally with breath sounds bilaterally.
Abdomen showed obese, mildly distended, moderately tender
abdomen over the transplantation site in the right lower
quadrant with peri-incisional tenderness.  There was mild
fullness to palpation.  Extremities warm without edema.
Neurological examination was intact.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count 14.2, hematocrit 24.3,
platelet count 385,000.  Sodium 130, potassium 6.3, chloride
93, bicarb 16, BUN 83, creatinine 5.3, glucose 330, calcium,
magnesium and phos was 8.5, 1.5 and 3.9 respectively.
Urinalysis showed [**3-9**] white blood cell count, occasional
bacteria and nitrite positive.  The patient had liver
function tests with AST and ALT of 28 and 28, alk phos of 82,
total bilirubin of 0.6, albumin of 3.6, amylase of 52 and
lipase 46.

RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray on admission showed no evidence of
pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure without free
air under the diaphragm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Transplant
Surgery Service with intravenous Zosyn and was continued to
be followed.  Nephrology began to follow the patient on [**2146-8-3**], the date of admission, and recommended no changes
to his immunosuppression and agreed with the plan of volume
repletion.  CT of the abdomen on [**8-3**] also showed fluid
collection around the right transplant kidney.  On hospital
day one overnight patient was transferred to the SICU for
decreased hematocrit and decreasing oxygen saturation and for
further one on one monitoring.  While in the unit patient was
transfused four units packed red blood cells and patient's
tachypnea also improved.  The patient was taken to the
Operating Room on the [**8-4**] for evacuation of hematoma
that was found around his perinephric area of the right
cadaveric kidney transplant.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit after having perinephric hematoma
evacuation, exploratory laparotomy washout procedure.  On
postoperative day No. 13 and one from hematoma evacuation
patient was continued on Zosyn as he had been two days prior
and patient remained stable overnight with temperatures of
99.8, heart rate of 90-100, blood pressure 100/60,
respiratory rate 20 and 97% and CVP of 14.  The patient was
awake and alert in the unit.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally with decreased breath sounds at the
bases.  Chest x-ray showed atelectatic changes
postoperatively.  The patient continued to have good renal
output and was transferred to the floor on the afternoon of
[**2146-8-5**].  The patient continued to do well on [**2146-8-6**], only complaining of tenderness of the right lower
quadrant area.  However, in the afternoon of [**2146-8-6**],
the patient noted that his left arm began swelling and the
patient had ultrasound to rule out left upper extremity deep
venous thrombosis which was found to be negative.  On [**2146-8-7**], the patient continued to do well.  The left arm
swelling went down and renal function began to improve with
creatinine from 2.9 to 2.4.  The Renal team continued to
follow the patient during his hospital course and patient was
changed from valacyclovir q. 8h. to valacyclovir q. day.  The
patient had continued improvement.  Saturations on ambulation
with physical therapy improved from the 80's prior to
admission to 95 to 99%.  Pulmonary team was consulted for
patient's history of sleep apnea and prior desaturations on
ambulation, however, was found to be clear by Pulmonary at
this time and suggested that the desaturations were
attributed to atelectatic type changes postoperatively.
Patient was discharged on the [**2146-8-10**] to [**Hospital6 7068**] in good condition.

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain put out scant output of 15 on
day of discharge and was removed, however, was still oozing
after the drain was pulled and needed to have dressing
changed three times a day p.r.n. until oozing subsides,
however, wound looked clean and intact.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital6 310**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Status post cadaveric kidney transplant
with perinephric fluid collection and perinephric hematoma
evacuation.
