Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
emergency salvage replacement ascending aorta/resusp. aortic
valve [**2102-12-24**]
tracheostomy and PEG placement [**2103-1-8**]


History of Present Illness:
59 yo male admitted to ER at Addison-[**Doctor Last Name **] for chest and back
pain.CT scan there showed acute aortic dissection from ascending
to left common iliac. Transferred  by [**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where he subsequently suffered cardiac arrest. CPR started and
taken emergently to OR.

Past Medical History:
benign prostatic hypertrophy

Social History:
lives with wife


Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
CPR being performed in ER; no assessment done
est. 95 kg  185 cm

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
A very limited Transgastric imaging showed a massive pericardial
effusion and a dissection extending all the way in the thoracic
aorta. Patient was having CPR done at that time.

POST-BYPASS:
The patient is AV paced and on an infusion of epinephrine and
norepinephrine. Mild to moderate global RV hypokinesis. Trivial
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Aortic valve leaflets appear normal. LV funtion
intact, EF 45%. The aortic dissection is again visualized in the
arch and descending aorta, with flow into the true lumen. No
pericardial effusion.
Post bypass examination of all the valves and regional wall
motions did not reveal any abnormalities.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

FINDINGS:

MRI: The previously identified diffusion abnormalities in the
left frontal
and parietal lobes are less apparent on the current study
indicating evolution
of the previously seen infarcts. There is no evidence of acute
hemorrhage or
major vascular territory infarction, mass, or mass effect. The
ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and configuration.

Inspissated material is again seen in the left maxillary sinus
as well as
mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus and fluid opacification
of the
bilateral mastoid air cells.

MRA: The major intracranial arteries of the anterior and
posterior circulation
are patent without flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or
aneurysm greater than
2 mm within the resolution of MR angiogram.

IMPRESSION:
1. Expected evolution of left frontal and parietal subcortical
infarcts. No
evidence of acute hemorrhage or major vascular territory
infarction.

2. Patent major intracranial arteries without flow-limiting
stenosis,
significant mural irregularity, or aneurysm greater than 2 mm.

3. Persistent fluid and/or mucosal thickening in the paranasal
sinuses and
mastoid air cells.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Reason: eval for pleural effusions



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   59 year old man s/p type A dissection repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for pleural effusions



Final Report
INDICATION: Status post dissection repair.

FINDINGS: There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than
right with small atelectasis, roughly unchanged from the prior.
The
cardiomediastinal contours, notable for cardiomegaly are stable.
A
tracheostomy tube terminates 5.1 cm above the carina. There is
mild pulmonary
vasculature engorgement, but no acute pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION: Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
