History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67736**] is a 62 year-old woman with a history of hypertension
and hyperlipidemia who initially presented to an OSH on [**3-18**]
with pneumonia, now being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation of hypoxia.

Per discussion with hospitalist at OSH, patient initially
presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-16**] with cough and SOB; CXR at that
time reportedly showed no infiltrate; antibiotics were started
as an outpatient. Then admitted to the OSH on [**3-18**] with cough
and diarrhea and was found to have a LLL PNA. Started on
Levaquin IV. Blood cultures and legionella antigen were
negative. A few days into the hospitalization, IV steroids were
started. On [**3-24**] an ABG was obtained and showed 7.48/38/57. A CT
was done and showed bilateral infiltrates and no PE; zosyn was
started. An echo was also done and showed normal EF and mild
pulmonary hypertension. On [**3-30**], IV vancomycin was started.
Given concern for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 7615**] was started on day of
transfer. Given persistent hypoxia, transfer to BIMDC was
arranged.

Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports feeling SOB though
not significantly worse than prior days. Denies chest pains,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension
2. Hyperlipidemia
3. Hypothyroidism
4. Asthma
5. Anxiety
6. Depression
7. GERD
8. Migraines

Social History:
Lives with mother. [**Name (NI) 1403**] as a personal care assistant and bus
monitor (for special needs children). For the former, works with
OTC chemical supplies. Negative for tobacco, alcohol, illicits.

Family History:
Mother with asthma, diabetes, breast CA. Sister with thyroid CA.

Physical Exam:
At admission:
VITALS: T 96, BP 120/57, HR 91, RR 27, 95% on 70% hi-flow mask
GEN: Ill-appearing, slightly uncomfortable though speaking in
full sentences.
HEENT: PERRL. Anicteric. No pallor. Dry MM. No apparent thrush.
Poor dentition. No cervical LAD.
CV: RRR. No murmurs appreciated.
PULM: Diffuse crackles.
ABD: Soft. NT/ND. Good bowel sounds. Superficial echymoses.
EXT: Warm. Trace edema bilaterally.
NEURO: CNII-XII grossly intact. Strength 5-/5 in all four
extremitites both distally and proximally. Sensation grossly
intact to light touch.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2191-4-1**]:
IMPRESSION: Widespread pulmonary opacities, possibly due to
acute widespread pneumonia, but a component of underlying
chronic lung disease is suspected. Cystic lucencies could
reflect underlying emphysema or fibrosis, cavitary pneumonia in
the upper lobes is also possible. In the absence of older films
for comparison, consider a chest CT for more complete
evaluation.

BRONCHIAL WASHINGS Procedure Date of [**2191-4-3**]:
Bronchial Lavage: ATYPICAL.
Clusters of atypical epithelial cells, favor reactive; pulmonary
macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2191-4-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse lung opacification, involving all lobes. The pattern
is most suggestive of ARDS. Severe infection is another
consideration.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. Support lines and tubes as described.
4. Coronary artery calcifications.
5. Hyperdense material in the nondistended gallbladder may
represent sludge, stones, or vicarious excretion of contrast
from an outside hospital exam.

RENAL U.S. PORT Study Date of [**2191-4-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal stones.
2. The kidneys are diffusely echogenic, suggestive of diffuse
parenchymal disease.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2191-4-9**]:
IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombus within the left
internal jugular vein extending into the subclavian vein and
surrounding the indwelling central venous catheter and
associated left arm edema.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT Study Date of [**2191-4-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval removal of the left IJ catheter with
non-occlusive thrombus again demonstrated in the left internal
jugular. Slightly limited exam but no apparent extension into
the subclavian vein.
