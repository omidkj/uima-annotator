right chest wall / RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
52M with renal cell carcinoma who presents with pleuritic RUQ
pain x 1 day.  He reports having the same pain in past (see
discharge summary [**2127-6-27**]) with extensive workup and no etiology
found.  The pain is located under his right anterior lower ribs,
radiating up to mid chest and down to RUQ.  Associated with
nausea/vomiting.  Also with cough productive of green sputum x 3
days.  Pain much worse with cough and vomiting.  Taking
oxycontin 80 TID at home plus prn oxycodone 30 mg without
relief.  Also using Zofran, ativan and Compazine which help with
nausea significantly.   He has chronic edema in both legs due to
prior DVT, on coumadin, he reports this is unchanged.  Denies
fever. No diarrhea. No other abd pain or CP. Last chemo 9 days
ago.  No hematuria.
In the ED: EKG: ST 106, NA/NI, no STEMI.  Given IVF, dilaudid,
antiemetics.  CT chest/abd with contrast done, no significant
new findings.

ROS positive as above, otherwise negative in full.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- [**2126-2-12**]: RLE DVT. CT torso showed an 8.9 x 8.4 cm mass in the
upper pole of his right kidney with tumor thrombus extending
into
the right renal vein, IVC, and right iliac/femoral veins.  There
was suspicion for involvement of the right adrenal gland by his
primary tumor.  There was also noted to be "bulky"
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy "measuring approximately 4 cm."
Core needle biopsy of  his left supraclavicular lymph node,
demonstrated papillary carcinoma, consistent with metastatic
papillary renal cell carcinoma.
- [**2-/2126**]: Started on sunitinib 50 mg daily for a 28-day
course. Had severe nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and
stomatitis around the time of completion of the 28-day cycle.
- [**2126-4-6**]: Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with severe nausea and
worsening
abdominal pain. Also noted growth of his left supraclavicular
lymph node.
- [**2126-4-7**]: Follow up CT demonstrated interval increase in his
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, increase of the right adrenal
mass and presence of his extensive tumor thrombus throughout the
right renal vein and inferior IVC up to the confluence of the
hepatitic veins. It also showed suspicion for continued deep
venous thrombosis of the right common femoral and right
superficial femoral veins.
- [**2126-4-29**]: Began cycle 1 of bevacizumab and temsirolimus per
phase II protocol 08-184
- [**2126-6-21**]: Hospitalized with vomiting and pleuritic chest pain.
CT scan ruled out acute PE, showed overall stable disease and
decreased size of the supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Found to
have lower extremities DVT was started on LMWH. Bevacizumab was
held due to ongoing anticoagulation.
- [**2126-8-19**] a CT scan torso performed after cycle #4 showed
mixed
behavior with overall decreased right renal mass bulk but stable
and slight increased periaortic, retrocrural, mesenteric, and
supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Stable extent of tumor/thrombus
involvement of right renal vein and IVC. Stable tumor
replacement
of the right adrenal gland.
- [**2126-12-10**] CT TORSO showed stable disease.
- [**2126-12-30**] Torisel held due to marked worsening of lower
extremities edema
- [**2127-1-6**] clinical disease progression. Pt taken off study
08-184
- [**2127-1-7**] start Avastin and Torisel off protocol
- [**2126-2-10**] CT torso stable disease
