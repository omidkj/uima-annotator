Respiratory distress

none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] is a 52 year old man with achondroplasia, morbid
obesity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome c/b pulmonary
hypertension and right heart failure, diabetes mellitus and
hypertension who was recently discharged after treatment for an
MSSA pneumonia treated with a course of vancomycin.
.
During his last hospitalization, the patient was found to be in
hypercarbic respiratory failure on presentation to the ED and
was intubated via his right nare. His CXR showed pneumonia and
an intubated sputum culture grew MSSA. He was treated with
Vancomycin given his allergies to cephalosporins and penicillins
(including anaphylaxis) and diuresed for volume overload in the
setting of right heart failure. He was extubated and improved
clinically but had
persistent fevers which resolved over 3 days with a downtrending
fever curve each day. it was felt that fevers were due to slowly
resolving MSSA pneumonia and the decision was made to continue
treatment for 14 day course. He was discharged home to complete
Vancomycin via PICC. He was back to his home 3L oxygen
requirement prior to discharge.
.
Over the last week or so, the patient has felt increasingly SOB.
He increased his home O2 up to 3.5 L by NC. He denied fevers,
chills, DOE, increasing weight, or PND. He did say that he has
orthopnea, which is stable. The patient does have COPD and is
managed with inhalers. He is on CPAP at night. The patient
denies chest pain or recent med changes.
.
The patient was initially at [**Hospital3 4107**] where he was given
Vanc and methylprednisone. He was transfered ti [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial VS were: O2 was 94% on 4L, 25-26 RR/minute,
tachy to 103, BP: 180/94. He was given Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin and transfered to the ICU for concern about
possible difficult airway if need for intubation arises.

CXR [**2137-2-7**]
The lower lungs was partly excluded. The heart appears enlarged
but is incompletely assessed. Allowing for differences in
technique, the
mediastinal contours are probably unchanged. This view shows
perihilar
fullness and indistinct prominent pulmonary vascularity
suggesting
mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema. IMPRESSION: Limited view
suggesting pulmonary edema.

TTE [**2137-2-8**]
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
is not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Severe
pulmonary hypertension. Hypertrophied, dilated and mildly
hypokinetic right ventricle. Small, underfilled left ventricle
with preserved global systolic function. Limited study.

CXR [**2137-2-9**]
Current examination is limited by body habitus. Allowing for
such,
there is normal color flow and augmentation in the common
femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, and
peroneal veins. Compression of the right distal superficial
femoral vein was not obtained. However, entire extent of the
superficial femoral vein demonstrates normal flow. IMPRESSION:
Somewhat limited exam with no evidence to suggest DVT.

CXR [**2137-2-11**]
Portable semierect AP radiograph was obtained. The study is
limited due to patient body habitus. There has been little
interval change in
comparison to prior study from the day before with substantial
 opacification of the right lung due to a pleural effusion as
well as opacification of tbe left lung base along with a small
left pleural effusion. Heart size and mediastinal contour remain
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Overall little change in comparison to prior study
from the day before with redemonstration of substantial
opacification of the right lung as
