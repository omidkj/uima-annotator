History of Present Illness:
58 year-old woman with hypertension, former tobacco use, and

shortness of breath and a blood pressure of 200/100.  She was
found to have an enlarging ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm on
CTA.

Cardiac catheter [**2154-2-6**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Moderate aortic regurgitation.
3. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
4. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
5. Large aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
After admission, Mrs. [**Known lastname 58041**] underwent a cardiac catheter.
Supravalvular aortography revealed a large aneurysmal (>7cm)
dilation arising from 2-3 cm above the aortic valve and
encroaching on the true lumen of the aorta. 2+ aortic
regurgitation was noted. On [**2-7**], she was taken to the
operating room for ascending aortic and hemiarch relacement as
well as aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve.
Postoperatively, she was admitted to the cardiac ICU. Her
postoperative course was complicated (again) by repiratory
failure. She weaned slowly off the vent but failed extubation
after successfully passing several breathing trials. She had to
be reintubated and underwent an open trachestomy by the thoracic
surgery team on [**2153-2-19**]. Her blood pressure was controlled on a
nipride drip initially. Later she could be controlled below 110
systolically on oral Antihypertensives. She was fed via a
Dobhoff tube and tube feedings. During the days she tolerated
several hours on trach mask in the chair but spend the night on
the ventilator on minimal settings. She was diuresed
appropriately until she reached preoperative weights.   She was
ultimately weanod off the ventilator, and placed on trach
collar.
On [**2-23**], she was started on IV Vancomycin for MRSA on a central
line, and 1 positive blood culture.  She should complete a 6
week course.  Her trough levels have been approx. 17 (goal
trough per ID service is 15-20), on 1250 mg IV BID.
She has passed swallow studies, oral feedings have been
advanced, and her feeding tube was removed, as she is now eating
a regular diet without difficulty.
Her trach was downsized from a 6 to a 4, then subsequently
removed (on [**2153-3-16**]).
At discharge, she was in a good condition. Her wound was without
signs of wound infection.

Of note, during her hospitalization, she had a possible exposure
to a TB+ person.  Since she had a previous +PPD, we can not use
this as a screening test to monitor sero-conversion.  Ms. [**Known lastname 58041**]
therefore must be monitored for the next year for symptoms of
tuberculosis and worked up if these symptoms are found.
