CT HEAD:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally
midline structures, hydrocephalus, major or minor vascular
territorial
infarction. The density values of the brain parenchyma are
maintained. The
visualized soft tissues and osseous structures appear normal.
The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells appear
well aerated.
The appearance of the ventricles and sulci is unchanged since
[**2161-2-16**]. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR:Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2162-7-25**].
The cardiomediastinal silhouette was stable. The lungs are
essentially clear
except for minimal atelectasis at the right base. There is no
pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
.
EKG [**7-25**] - Sinus rhythm. Non-specific T wave change in lead III.
Early transition. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2162-7-25**]
the atrial premature beats are absent. T wave inversion in lead
III is new.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 y/o F with h/o Asthma, tobacco abuse, HTN, Depression,
Anxiety, Chronic pain, insomnia, diverticulitis s/p partial
colectomy, and gerd was found unresponsive at home by her
roommate early [**7-25**], concern for toxic ingestion.
.
Altered Mental status: DDx includes metabolic causes:
hyponatremia, toxic ingestion of prescription meds, infection,
hypercarbia in the setting of asthma, or seizure or other
neurologic event. However, the patient improved significantly on
initial overnight admission, there was no infectious etiology
identified, and hyponatremia resolved. The most likely
explanation for AMS change is excessive sedation/accidental
overdose of her home meds. Head CT was negative on admission.
UTox + for amphetamines.  Toxicology consult was called who
reccomended Intial supportive care.  While in the ICU, all the
sedating medications were held including Benzos, Seroquel Etc.
On transfer to the floor, patient extremely anxious about lack
of psychiatric medications.  Patient stated that she couldn't
sleep without them.  Given trazodone 75 mg PO one evening prior
to discharge.  Spoke with patient's psychiatrist prior to
discharge who recommended discharing patient on low dose
seroquel.  Patient to follow up with psychiatrist this week.
.

Wheezing
Pt has history of asthma in chart, but last PFTs showed mild
restrictive lung disease. Increased concern for upper airway
obstruction. Pt continues to feel short of breath despite O2
sats in high 90s.  Asthma exacerbation most likely explanation
of wheezing, although diffuse exp wheezes on exam that seem to
resolve with sleep.  Albuterol and ipratropium nebs were given
in house.  Continued Singulair. Also given solumedrol 20 IV TID
while in the ICU. While in the MICU patient was given
supplemental O2 to keep sats > 92%.  Patient did not require any
oxygen while on teh floor.  ENT was consulted for furthur
investigation.  As per ENT note - no evidence of airway
obstruction above vocal folds. No evidence of vocal fold
dysfunction. Patient has normal voice and at this point no
audible breathing noise (stridor/stertor). History of
tracheomalacia seen on airway CT [**2159**], she has been
followed by pulmonology for this and asthma.  Upper airway noise
heard by team earlier today could be tracheomalacia.


Hypotension
Pt with labile BP's from 80/60-120/70, likely related to
metabolic/toxic ingestion. BP's improved after initial
presentation.  In the ICU patient was placed on telemetry and
IVFs were given as needed for hypotension.  Once stable on the
floor, telemetry was discontinued.
.
ARF Pt with baseline Cr of ~1, Cr of 1.9 on admission, which
trended back down to 0.8.  Electrolytes were monitored carefully
throughout stay and repleted as needed.
.
Hyponatremia
Pt appears volume down on initial exam, and clinically has been
having increased urination at home. Hyponatremia likely from
hypovolemic hyponatremia. Last Na 136 on [**5-31**]. [**Month (only) 116**] be related
to toxic ingestion or to hyperglycemia. Na has increased to 137
on [**7-26**].
.
Anxiety/Depression
held all sedating meds in the unit, discussed case with
psychiatrist.
