CHIEF COMPLAINT ON ADMISSION:  Shortness of breath, fever,
and groin pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48 year old female
status post right total knee replacement in [**2172-6-18**] for
osteoarthritis who was discharged to rehabilitation with an
uncomplicated postoperative course.  In [**2173-2-16**] she
developed a right septic knee and arthrostomy was performed
at [**Hospital 1774**] Hospital.  On [**2173-5-10**], a revision to the right
total knee replacement was performed and the second stage
removal of antibiotic cement.  In [**2173-5-18**], incision and
drainage of the right knee hematoma was performed.  Over this
period (from [**2173-2-16**] to [**2173-6-18**]) the patient had
been on Oxacillin through a PICC line.  A temperature spike
two to three weeks ago lead to removal of the PICC line and a
new PICC line was placed in the right arm and the patient was
started on Vancomycin on [**2173-6-26**].  He was also on low
dose Coumadin since surgery in [**2172-6-18**].  The Coumadin
was recently stopped two weeks prior to this current
admission.  The patient also completed a course of Levaquin
for left lower lobe pneumonia approximately one month prior
to admission.  Five days prior to admission the patient had
reported acute onset of shortness of breath while sitting in
a chair.  The shortness of breath has been episodic since
then with oxygen saturation dropping to the high 80s at
[**Hospital3 2558**].  He reports occasional right calf pain but no
calf or sputum currently.  The patient feels currently short
of breath and exhibits dyspnea on exertion.  She had an
episode of chest pain the day of admission with pressure
lasting hours with intermittent sharp, stabbing pains, also
episodic diaphoresis and regurgitation with temperature up to
102.8 one week prior to admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Morbid obesity; 2.  Severe
degenerative joint disease, status post total knee
replacement; 3.  Depression; 4.  Anxiety; 5.  Substance; 6.
Hepatitis C; 7.  Anemia; 8.  Nephrolithiasis; 9.
Hypertension; 10. Hernia repair; 11. Status post
cholecystectomy; 12. Questionable history of
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

ADMISSION AS AN OUTPATIENT:  Diltiazem, Lisinopril,
Wellbutrin, Protonix, Effexor, Iron Sulfate, Oxy-Contin,
Oxycodone, Trazodone, Compazine, Vancomycin

ALLERGIES:  Iodine

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Tobacco use for 35 years, [**11-19**] pack per day.
There is a history of ethanol use and intravenous drug use
including heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs.  The
patient currently lives at [**Hospital3 2558**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.4, blood pressure
108/52, heartrate 103, respiratory rate 14, oxygen saturation
98% on room air.  General:  This is a very obese female.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat;  Moist mucous membranes,
oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Jugulovenous distension not
present, supple.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2,
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Marked surgical scars
and large ventral hernia.  Extremities:  There is a right
PICC line, no erythema, negative for Hommas sign.  No
tenderness on palpation and no asymmetric edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on examination revealed
sodium 152, potassium 4.5, chloride 98, bicarbonate 23, BUN
16, creatinine 1.0, glucose 109, white blood cell count 15.7
with a differential of 74% neutrophils, 0 bands, 14
lymphocytes, hematocrit 31.5, compared to a prior 38 and
platelets 187.  Chest x-ray was negative for pneumonia or
congestive heart failure.  Lower extremity noninvasives were
performed and were negative.  V/Q scan was negative.
Electrocardiogram was non-contributory.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Medicine.
There was a strong suspicion for a pulmonary embolus given
the recent history of surgical procedures and the morbidity
status of the patient.  A computerized tomographic
angiography was performed and revealed a right segmental
defect which was attributed as a possibility.  The patient
was started on heparin and was evaluated by cardiac enzymes
for myocardial infarction.  The patient ruled out for
myocardial infarction and echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 35%, mildly dilated left atrium, moderately
dilated right atrium, mildly dilated left ventricle and
moderate global left ventricle hypokinesis.

On [**7-2**], three out of four blood cultures came back
positive for gram negative rods and the patient was started
on Zosyn.  A computerized tomography scan of the pelvis
demonstrated a right iliacus, iliopsoas abscess or myositis.

On [**7-3**], the patient experienced worsening right groin
and abdominal pain with now the pain radiating to the right
flank.  He became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure
in the 70s and a hematocrit of 25.  A computerized tomography
scan of the pelvis with contrast revealed a large
retroperitoneal hematoma and the patient was transferred to
the Medicine Intensive Care Unit Service.  The hematocrit
further dropped to 20 and surgical consult was asked for.
Also Interventional Radiology consulted.  PTT was 100 that
morning and the patient was administered packed red blood
cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma.  A left subclavian
line and a right arterial line were placed.  The patient was
treated with Vancomycin and Imipenem.  Because of the falling
hematocrit the patient received additional packed red blood
cell transfusions.  Eventually on [**7-6**], the hematocrit
stabilized and the patient was transferred again back to the
floor.  At that time, the vital signs revealed temperature
98.7, blood pressure 140/80, heartrate 88, respiratory rate
20 and oxygen saturation 99% with 4 liters of oxygen.
Subsequently, the patient's hematocrit was followed every 12
hours and remained stable.  Antibiotics were continued with
Vancomycin discontinued on [**7-10**].  Repeat abdominal
computerized tomography scan demonstrated stable
retroperitoneal hematoma.  On [**2173-7-10**], the patient
complained of increased abdominal pain.  At this point the
pain medications were Oxy-Contin, Oxycodone, Morphine prn,
Tylenol and these were increased.  Pain consult was called
but was unable to see the patient because the patient was
repeatedly outside of her room in the building, in order to
smoke.

At the point of dictation of this summary, the plan is for
the patient to have PICC line installed on the morning of
[**2173-7-12**] and to be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility on the same day.  The plan is for the patient to
continue the antibiotics, in particular Meropenem for a total
of four to six weeks pending repeat of the abdominal
computerized tomography scan and repeat of the blood
cultures.
