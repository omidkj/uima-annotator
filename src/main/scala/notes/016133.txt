was able to eat custard while supervised closely by the nurse.
The patient is still at high risk for aspiration even with
strict precautions.  Options includind a PEG tube and atrach
discussed with proxy.  Risks and benefits discussed and
questions answered.  She decided that pt would be better off at

a higher risk of aspiration.

3 for C. difficile. Stool has been GUIAC positive for entire
stay.  Pt had localized colon cancer treated with hemicolectomy
in '[**61**].  No abdominal pain throughout admission but some
diarrhea in response to tube feeds.

5. DM - Takes glipizide as outpatient which is being held while
here. Placed on lantus and sliding scale while here because on
tube feeds (see FEN).  Sent home on glipizide plus SS.
