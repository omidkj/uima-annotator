FLEX SIGMOIDOSCOPY ([**8-3**]): Mix of stool and old blood was found
in the rectum and sigmoid. One diverticulum was noted at
approximately ~20cm. No source of bleeding was identified to
explain patient's bleeding and a possible fistula to the vagina.
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to sigmoid colon at 30cm.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2251**] is a 79 y/o woman with h/o of CAD s/p CABG, DM,
Dementia and HTN who presented with hemotochezia, vaginal
bleeding and acute blood loss anemia, and a Klebsiella UTI.

1. Hematochezia: Patient with known diverticulosis and past
history of brown discharge via the vagina. This was likely a
diverticular bleed with blood extravasating to the vagina
through a fistula. The patient was admitted to the ICU and
gastroenterology was consulted and she underwent sigmoidoscopy
on [**8-3**] with old blood seen, but no source, no evidence of
recto-vaginal fistula on endoscopy. She required 7 units of PRBC
in the ICU to maintain her Hct despite decreased bleeding. She
has not had any bleeding since [**8-3**], and has had stable vitals
and Hct after transfer to the floor on [**8-5**]. She underwent CT
abdomen/pelvis which demostrated oral contrast in the vagina,
confirming the existence of a recto-vaginal fistula. She
underwent colonoscopy on [**8-9**] which showed severe diverticulosis
but no active bleeding. She will be discharged to follow up with
her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] GI, no further GI follow-up is necessary at this
time.  The patient was advised to stay well-hydrated and use
stool softeners as needed to avoid constipation and to seek
medical attention if she has repeat bleeding in the future.

2. Chest pain: patient had bilateral lower chest pain which
appeared to be chronic. EKG and three sets of cardiac en
