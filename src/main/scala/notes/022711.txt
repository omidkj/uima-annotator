History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname 107394**] is a 75 year old male with history of COPD, CAD s/p
CABGx3, CHF, and Afib who is transferred from outside hospital
with increasing shortness of breath. The patient is followed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1728**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] for his multiple medical
conditions. He was placed on portable oxygen at home for nightly
use for the last two weeks. He recently took a trip to
Scottsdale, AZ. On the flight the patient experienced an episode
of shortness of breath. He describes a "choking" feeling, unable
to catch his breath. The patient was placed on oxygen for the
remainder of the flight. The next day the patient experience
another episode on dyspnea with excessive, productive cough
while in the car with family members. The patient describes the
sputum as a white "gluey" material. He is currently denying
fever/chills.
.
OSH Course
The patient went to the ED for assessment of his dyspnea. He was
given narcotics for a secondary complaint of torticullis which
resulted in altered mental status. The patient was admitted for
five days. He received a work-up for pneumonia, CHF
exacerbation, and COPD exacerbation. On admission the patient
had an elevated BNP of 2813, a CK MB 0.5, and troponin-I of
0.06. OSH CXR showed right-sided infiltrate. An EKG showed
incomplete RBBB, nonspecific ST changes, and no evidence of
acute ischemic change. LENIs negative for DVT. ECHO showed EF of
45-50%, aortic valve thickening and calcification, with elevated
RV pressures. All of these findings were consistent with
findings on previous Echo at [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient was started on
ceftriaxone for suspected pneumonia. The patient was given 20mg
torsemide daily.


Past Medical History:

CAD s/p CABG ([**2161**]) LIMA to LAD, SVG to PDA, SG to OM
[**2178-8-19**]: Cath -
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
three vessel disease conduit vessels from prior CABG. The LMCA,
LAD
and LCx were occluded. The RCA had a 60% mid-vessel stenosis and
an
occluded pDA.
2. Arterial conduit arteriography revealed the LIMA to be widely

patent. The SVG-OM was widely patent. SVG to the PDA the patent
with
60-70% proximal diffuse disease and distal 50% disease.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling pressure with RVEDP of 18 mmHg and pulmonary capillary
wedge
pressure of 28 mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.1
l/min/m2.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:

There is a large acute left retroperitoneal hematoma extending
along the left psoas muscle, which is expanded. The hematoma is
acute in appearance with dependent high-attenuation material
consistent with layering phenomenon. There is also focal
increased attenuation at the posterior aspect of the hematoma on
the enhanced CT suggesting active extravasation. The hematoma
measures 10 x 9 x 16 cm in dimensions.

Brief Hospital Course:
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC
The patient was admitted with anasarca and a 2L oxygen
requirement. He was started on IV diuretics, responding to 60mg
IV torsemide.

FALL
The patient sustained a fall from a chair on [**2178-11-18**], landing
on his buttocks without head trauma or LOC. Hip films were
obtained to consider skeletal damage or fracture, which were
negative.

RETROPERITONEAL BLEED
On the morning of [**2178-11-19**], the patient awoke with sharp left
lower quadrant pain that he felt was radiating up from his left
leg. His abdomen was more distended, and a CT was obtained that
showed an acute retroperitoneal hematoma. The patient was
initially very hemodynamically stable, but later became
tachycardic and hypotensive, and was transferred to the medical
intensive care unit. He was transfused units, including one
irradiated unit that was given via emergency release when the
patient began to decompensate.

PNEUMONIA
The patient was admitted in a hospital in Scottsdale, AZ with
shortness of breath and fever. He was treated with ceftriazone,
starting on [**2178-11-11**].

ANEMIA
The patient was found to have iron deficiency anemia
