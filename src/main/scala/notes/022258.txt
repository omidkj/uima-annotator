HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 40-year-old man with a past medical history
significant for type 1 diabetes poorly controlled,
hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and resting idiopathic
sinus tachycardia, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] Intensive Care Unit with a severe
pneumonia, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.

He initially presented to his primary care provider with [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
fever to 103, a rising white count to 14,000, and received 1
gram of ceftriaxone and declined admission.  The following
day he was again febrile, having shaking chills, cough,
nausea, and myalgias, which led to his admission that day.
He was continued on azithromycin, ceftriaxone while inhouse
at the outside hospital.  He had transient chest pain leading
to cycling of cardiac enzymes with a negative troponin-I and
MB fraction, but a positive CK to 670.  Nonetheless, he was
started on Lovenox.  He remained febrile, his antibiotics
were changed to fluoroquinolones, Vancomycin, and Flagyl.  He
became acutely hypotensive to 80/50 with a temperature of
94.5 degrees F.  His liver enzymes were elevated and a gas at
this point was 7.31/229/63 on 100% nonrebreather.

A stat echocardiogram was obtained showing an ejection
fraction of 20-25%.  He developed abdominal distention and
pain.  Abdominal examination however, was negative at that
point.  Given this picture of probable sepsis, he was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Intensive Care Unit.

IMAGING STUDIES:
Chest x-ray [**2150-1-2**] per report showed no infiltrates, but
central peribronchial cuffing consistent with bronchitis.
Abdominal ultrasound on [**2150-1-3**] per report small bilateral
pleural effusions with normal examination.  Echocardiogram
[**2150-1-3**] per report is normal valvular function, normal
chamber size, left ventricular function with global depressed
hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 20-25%, no wall motion
abnormalities, normal RV function, trace MR and no effusion.

Chest x-ray at [**Hospital1 69**] showing
mild vascular redistribution consistent with congestive heart
failure and a right sided infiltrate.  KUB showing no free
air and no air fluid levels, stool in the left colon.
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.

Electrocardiogram:
Sinus tachycardia of slipping ST segments anteriorly, poor
R-wave progression, no acute ischemic changes when compared
to previous.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
In the Intensive Care Unit, a repeat chest x-ray showed
bilateral infiltrates with a consistent aspiration pneumonia.
He was initially continued on levofloxacin, Vancomycin, and
Flagyl as well as O2.  A CT scan was obtained to rule out a
pulmonary embolus and a transthoracic echocardiogram to help
rule out endocarditis and to assess his wall motion.  This
showed an ejection fraction of again 20-25% with moderate
global hypokinesis in the left ventricle and depressed RV
function.  Cardiac enzymes as above returned with a
troponin-I of 13, a CK of 369, and a MB of 30.  This was felt
to be an enzyme leak in the presence of myocarditis and not
an acute coronary syndrome.

He was maintained initially on an insulin drip glucose
control.  He was transiently maintained on pressures for his
blood pressure.  However, these were weaned to off within 48
hours.  He was called out to the floor with three days
following this admission with stable pressures, off pressors,
sating at 97% on 6 liters of facemask O2 breathing
comfortably.

Upon arrival to the floor, his white count was down to 15.
His hematocrit however, had dropped to 33 with aggressive
fluid resuscitation.  His laboratories otherwise were within
normal limits.  His last arterial blood gas within the unit
was 7.42/42/88 on 70% O2.

For his pneumonia, he was continued on levofloxacin, and the
Vancomycin and Flagyl were stopped.  This was felt to be a
community acquired pneumonia.  Sputum cultures were sent
however, there was no growth in either the blood or the
sputum or in his urine.  Despite initial reads of chest x-ray
being indicative of possible aspiration, this was felt to be
unlikely given his low risk, should he have aspirated, it
would be more likely that it would be an aspiration
pneumonitis and not an actual pneumonia given he was
transferred with a full blown pneumonia.  He was continued on
the subsequent two days on oxygen to maintain a sat greater
than 95%, however, he rapidly resolved with treatment of his
pneumonia and diuresis.

The enzyme leak of cardiac enzymes as detailed above, was
initially worrisome.  However, Cardiology was asked to
comment on this leak.  They felt in the above setting, this
most likely did represent myocarditis and not an ischemic
event.  However, due to his risk factors of hyperlipidemia
and poorly controlled diabetes, that he would require a
stress test as an outpatient and might benefit from cardiac
catheterization.  Upon further review of these
recommendations, Cardiology team felt that catheterization
within the next week was not appropriate therapy given that
he may have still have some element of infection despite
adequate treatment, and that his pulmonary status is not back
to baseline.  This being the case, they recommended a cardiac
MRI to assess his coronary artery status.  This has been
scheduled and will be performed the day following discharge
as an outpatient.  These results will be available in the
[**Hospital1 **] computer system.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] does have a history of an idiopathic sinus
tachycardia.  It was felt that in the setting of some anemia,
that this needed to be more adequately controlled while in
house.  He was started on a low dose beta blocker which was
titrated up.  He will be discharged on 50 mg of atenolol q
day.

His depressed ejection fraction was felt to be again due to a
viral myocarditis; due to aggressive volume resuscitation in
the Intensive Care Unit, he became volume overloaded likely
contributing to his oxygen dependence.  While on the floor,
he was aggressively diuresed for approximately 6 liters of
fluid with resolution of his shortness of breath.  He will
benefit from a repeat echocardiogram some time within the
next month as an outpatient to reassess his ejection fraction
and current cardiac status.

While in house, his hematocrit did drop as discussed above.
