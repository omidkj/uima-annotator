Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Chief Complaint:
Headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Multiple lumbar punctures
Gastro-jejunal feeding tube placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 56M w/ HIV/AIDS, h/o cryptococcal meningitis
who presents with 5 days of headache and photophobia as well as
intermittent nausea/vomiting over the past 2 days. He feels the
headache is very similar to his symptoms when he was diagnosed
with cryptococcal meningitis in [**10-13**], with generalized pain over
the crown of his head that has been persistent and accompanied
occasionally by nausea and vomiting. He was referred to the ED
by his PCP where an LP was done with an opening pressure of 21,
215 WBC with 25% neutrophils, 67% lymphs, protein 101, glucose
59. Gram stain did not show any organisms but CSF cryptococcal
antigen waws positive. Non-contrast head CT was unremarkable. He
did not note fevers at home but had a fever to 101. ID was
consulted and recommended covering for bacterial meningitis as
well as for Listeria, HSV, and cryptococcal meningitis. He was

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING

MRI OF SPINE [**8-20**]- Diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement throughout
the cord and cauda equina keeping with patient's known history
of meningitis. No other focal lesions or extramedullary fluid
collections identified. No findings of discitis/osteomyelitis.

MRI OF HEAD [**8-20**]- New abnormal perivascular (early pseudocysts)
and leptomeningeal enhancement involving the left internal
capsule, cerebellar folia, bilateral internal auditory canals,
and bilateral trigeminal nerves. Given clinical history this is
consistent with cryptococcal meningeal inflammation. No focal
mass lesion identified.

Repeat MRI head [**9-12**]
1. New moderate edema in the right frontal lobe surrounding the
ventriculostomy catheter. Only minimal linear contrast
enhancement along the ventriculostomy catheter, which is
nonspecific. However, early cerebritis in this immunocompromised
patient cannot be excluded, as discussed above.
2. Decreased extent and intensity of preexisting leptomeningeal
enhancement, including cranial nerve enhancement, and
perivascular space enhancement.
3. Stable size of the ventricles without evidence of dilatation.
No evidence of periventricular or intraventricular blood
products.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 56 yo M with HIV and recurrent cryptococcal meningitis
on fluconazole complicated by continued nausea, vomiting,
headaches. Now s/p lumbar drain placement on [**8-28**] with long
complicated medical course including MICU stay and now stable
for rehab s/p G-J placement for medication administration of HIV
medications and nutrition.

MICU COURSE
On the morning of [**2172-8-11**], the patient had an unsuccessful LP and
worsening mental status.  Because of this, he had another lumbar
drain placed and was transfered to MICU.  There was concern
about his need for close nurse monitoring, his intractible
nausea/vom
