Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Mitral Valve - Mean Gradient:  3 mm Hg

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mitral
valve annuloplasty ring. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=40%). Septal motion
is paradoxical, c/w post CABG. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with
normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is present. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 1169**] was admitted on [**3-28**] after he underwent a mitral
valve repair, CABG x 3, and aortic valve replacement.  For
details of the operation please see the operative report.
Extubated on POD #1. Postoperatively he was on milrinone,
levophed and epinephrine to maintain his cardiac output and
blood pressure.  He received multiple blood transfusions as
well.Amiodarone started for A fib. Pressors/support weaned and
then restarted for decreasing C.I. Chest tubes removed. C diff.
positive with continuing diarhhea on POD #6 and flagyl started.
Beta blockade titrated. Echo showed global hypokinesis. Sub Q
heparin started for prophylaxis and mutiple BP agents added for
hypertension. Gentle diuresis restarted on POD #7, pacing wires
removed, and transferred to the floor to begin increasing his
activity level. on POD #11, his WBC rose to 18 and he was
pancultured. He c/o LLQ pain on POD #12. Cipro started for UTI.
Left pleural effusion tapped on POD #12.

At 6:30 AM on POD #13, he acutely decompensated with acute
respiratory failure on the floor. He had agonal breathing, was
bradycardic and had palpable pulses and was intubated by
anesthesia emergently during the code. Transferred back to CVICU
for stat TTE and left chest tube placed. Tamponade ruled out by
echo. Sternum found to be unstable on exam (no CPR had been
performed).Bronchoscopy done to rule out aspiration. Lactate
rose to 11 and general surgery was urgently consulted.Creatinine
rose to 2.2 and INR was 2.9. New subclavian accesss
established.He was taken directly to the OR and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
debrided his sternum and re-wired it. The general surgery team
then did an exploratory laparotomy to evaluate for acute
mesenteric ischemia. He had a right hemicolectomy,
cholecystectomy, aortagram with right common iliac artery to SMA
bypass graft ( vascular team), and then a small bowel resection
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. He was profoundly acidotic.

He was aggressively resuscitated the rest of the night with
multiple pressor support to maintain a BP. The family was
consulted about his extremely grave prognosis and they agreed to
continue the drips but no CPR or additional drug resuscitation.
Made CMO by family with increasing pressor requirements and
acidosis. Expired at 8:00 AM on [**4-11**]. Family declined autopsy.
Medical Examiner elected to review the case.
