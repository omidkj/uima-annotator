History of Present Illness:
72 year old male with admission to [**Hospital6 **] in
early [**Month (only) 547**] for heart failure. He had a positive persantine
stress at that time which showed large inferior and
inferolateral defects with no reversibility. A subsequent
cardiac catheterization revealed severe coronary artery disease
with an left ventricular aneurysm. Since that time he has been
taking Lasix with some improvement. Currently his symptoms have
remained stable since last seen.

Pertinent Results:
[**9-7**] Echo: PREBYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.
There is an infero-apical left ventricular aneurysm extending
from the apex of the heart at least 6-8 cm inferiorly containing
a large thrombus. It is unclear if there is flow between the
ventricle and the aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30%). The anterior wall
appears to be akinetic. Transgastric views are poor likely due
to the presence of the aneurysm making it difficult to evaluate
regional wall motion from mid-ventricle to apex. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal with normal free wall
contractility. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS: The patient is A-paced on milrinone and
phenylephrine infusions. The left ventricular aneurysm is no
longer seen. However, transgastric and mid-esophageal views of
the left-ventricle continue to be poor. Anterior akinesis
persists. LV systolic function is slightly improved and is
estimated at 30-35%. Right ventricular systolic function
continues to be normal. Mitral regurgitation is now mild (1+).
Normal aortic contours.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and underwent resection of the left
ventricular pseudoaneurysm with pericardial patch repair. Of
note bypasses were not performed due to anatomy.  See operative
for further details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative
antibiotics and was transfered to the intensive care unit for
post operative management.  In the first twenty four hours he
was weaned from sedation, awoke, and was extubated without
complications.  He remained in the intensive care for few days
as vasopressors and inotropes were progressively weaned off.  He
continued to progress slowly and was ready for transfer to the
floor on post operative day three.  Physical therapy worked with
him on strength and mobility.  He was started on coumadin for
aneurysmectomy with clots.  He continued to progress and was
ready for discharge home with services on post operative day
seven.

Unable to start ace inhibitor due to blood pressure.
