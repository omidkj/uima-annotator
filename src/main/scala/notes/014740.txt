History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67M with multiple recent admissions for volume
overload related to sCHF who presents with worsening fatigue and
weakness associated with weight gain over the last several days.

Patient is very somnlent on interview, but he is able to relate
that he has generally felt unwell for the past several months
during multiple repeated admissions. He acutely decompensated
from his baseline yesterday morning when he developed'shaking'
in his arms, worse than his baseline essential tremor. This
lasted approximately 3 hours before remitting spontaneously.
Additionally, he developed significant malaise and weakness
which progressed throughout the night. This morning, he reports
being unable to get out of bed or walk down the corridor of his
ALF. His caregiver [**First Name (Titles) 8706**] [**Name (NI) 13866**]>400 and weight gain of
approximately 7 pounds over the last 3 days, and brought him
into the ED.

In the ED, initial vitals were 11:01 0 97.8 70 106/60 18 98% RA.
He then became hypotensive into 70's, but responded to 250 cc NS
bolus. Initial labs were notable for acute elevation of Cr from
baseline of 1.3 to 3.1, K of 5.7, and troponin of 0.28 with MB
of 8. BNP also notably elevated to [**Numeric Identifier 38555**] from recent baseline of
6000. He was given full dose aspirin and dopamine was started.
He became tachycardic to 111 and developed mild chest pain
associated with nonspecific ST changes on EKG. Dopamine was
turned off with resolution of chest pain. Bedside Echo showed no
effusion and plump central IVC. Patient was transferred to the
CCU for further management. VS prior to transfer were BP 102/60
and O2 94% on 2L.

On arrival to the CCU, he is somnelent and falling asleep during
exam and interveiw. He endorses moderate shortness of breath,
but denies cough, fevers or chills. He reports medication
compliance and gets his meds in a blister pack. He reports
eating a low sodium diet, but admits to eating microwave popcorn
nightly. He denies recent chest pain. He was recently restarted
on lisinopril, spironolactone, and augmentin for presumed
cellultis. He thinks he has not been urinating as much recently.
