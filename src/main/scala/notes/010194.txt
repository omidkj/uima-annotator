Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of metastatic gallbladder
carcinoma, advanced vascular dementia, CVA with subsequent
aphasia/bedridden presenting with respiratory distress in the
setting of 7 days of decreased PO intake, decreased bowel
movements, cough and sputum production.  The family has been
unwilling to discuss code status or her possible death and have
been ambivalent about hospitalizations.  They want everything to
be done, except for a feeding tube.  Recent hospitalization in
[**2145-3-19**] addressed many of these issues, but they were unable
to convince the family otherwise.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: 99.3 (re-check rectally
102.9), 89, 157/77, 30, 100% 15L Non-Rebreather.  Exam was
notable for crackles in the left greater than right base.  CXR
did not show any focal opacities, but did show a mild left-sided
pleural effusion.  She was started on broad antibiotic coverage
with Cefepime/Vancomycin/
levofloxacin.  While trying to avoid intubation, the patient was
weaned to 4L NC, still satting 99% with improving tachypnea.
.
In the ICU, the patient opens her eyes to her daughter's voice
and does not appear to be in any respiratory distress, satting
100% on 2L NC.  Her daughter speaks limited English, but says
that she looks much better now than she did this AM.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of metastatic gallbladder
carcinoma, CVA with vascular dementia, and hypertension, now
presenting with respiratory distress and hypernatremia secondary
to decreased PO intake.
.
# Respiratory distress:  Upon initial presentation to the ED,
she required a NRB for oxygenation, but was gradually weaned to
oxygen by nasal cannula.  There was initial concern for the need
for intubation, but this was successfully avoided.  Upon arrival
to the ICU, she is requiring minimal oxygen and saturating 100%
on 1-2L.  She was started on broad antibiotic coverage in the ED
for a suspected aspiration-related pneumonia since she is a
clear aspiration risk. CXR on admission demonstrated trace left
pleural effusion, but no pneumonia.  However, given
leukocytosis, patient initially was started on Levaquin and
Ceftriaxone.  On discharge, patient remained afebrile with WBC
count trending down and with O2 sats in high 90s on room air.
She was discharged without any antibiotics given no suspicion
for pneumonia.
.
# Hypernatremia and hypokalemia:  Electrolyte imbalances
secondary to poor PO intake.  Free water deficit was about 2L on
admission.  Patient was hydrated with D5W with K+ in it and
abnormalities resolved.
.
# Hypertension: It seems unlikely that she is able to take her
PO anti-hypertensives (HCTZ and amlodipine), but she is also on
clonidine, which seems to be keeping her relatively
well-controlled.  She was mildly hypertensive in the ICU.
.
# Microcytic anemia:  Remained at her baseline.
.
# Goals of care re: Multi-infarct/vascular dementia and
metastatic GB carcinoma:  Patient is non-responsive and
non-verbal at baseline.  Family reported that her condition was
worse this AM compared to now.  Her prognosis remains poor, but
the family was insistent on continued measures to keep her
alive, except a feeding tube.
They were happy to take her home.
