History of Present Illness:
44 year old woman with a history of UC s/p total colectomy, PSC
diagnosed in [**2111**], cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2129**] (c/b jaundice and
ascites), and CML on gleevac (since [**2127**]) who presents from
clinic for worsening hyperbilirubinemia, increasing creatinine,
and fluid retention.
.
She was recently discharged on [**2132-10-22**] after admission for
expedited pre-transplant workup. Her course was complicated by
GI bleed, though EGD and ileostomy in the ICU were remarkable
for absence of varices and a non-bleeding ulcer at the GE
junction with old blood in the stomach. She did have significant
peristomal bleeding, which was thought to be the major source,
and found to have peristomal varices. She ultimately had
surgicel applied. She uses silver nitrate for peristomal
bleeding and is on PPI ppx. Received total of 6 units PRBC.
.
Course was also complicated by strep viridans bacteremia (grew
out on [**2132-10-15**] culture), for which no etiology was found. She
was treated with vanc/ceftriaxone initially and sent out on
cipro. MRCP did not reveal an etiology either. Paracentesis
could not be performed due to the absence of fluid. TTE
negative. Nl panorex. Reportedly had positive cultures at [**Doctor Last Name 13548**]a month ago (pre-dating these cultures on [**10-15**]).
.
Regarding her cirrhosis history, The patient states that she
first experienced clinical manifestations of her liver disease
in [**2129**] following her total colectomy. A biopsy performed at
that time revealed cirrhosis with extensive canalicular
cholestasis. The patient states that her cirrhosis was well
compensated until [**8-/2132**], when she began to experience jaundice,
leading to above admission for expedited transplant workup.
.
Today, the patient notes fatigue, nausea, and occasional
shortness of breath. She endorses continued mild swelling. She
remains off lasix and aldactone since before last admission (due
to hyponatremia). She denies fevers, chills, URI symptoms, chest
pain, abdominal pain, nausea, hematemesis, coffee ground emesis,
hematochezia, melena, increased ostomy output, urinary
frequency/urgency, or rash.
.
Her labs at OSH showed total bilirubin 40.4 with direct bili 25
(up from total bilirubin 30-32 one week ago). Creatinine was
1.62 (eGFR 34), up from 1.4 on discharge. AST 142, ALT 91. WBC
1.8, Hct 22.2 (from 23). 2

Imaging:
.
TEE [**10-31**]:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 30 cm from the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence for endocardits seen.
.
CXR [**11-1**]:
Heterogeneous infiltrative pulmonary abnormality most pronounced
in the left lower lobe is present throughout both lungs,
probably disseminated infection,starting with the most likely
viral or bacterial, including mycoplasma.
.
Renal US [**11-1**]:
FINDINGS: The right and left kidneys measure 15.1 and 15.4 cm,
respectively. No renal stones, renal masses, or hydronephrosis
are detected. The bladder is decompressed about a Foley
catheter. A large amount of ascites is noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal kidneys without hydronephrosis.
2. Large amount of ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
44yo F with PSC cirrhosis, UC s/p colectomy and ileostomy, CML
in remission on Gleevec, s/p recent admission for decompensation
with encephalopathy, peristomal bleeding, and bacteremia with
Strep Viridens, who during admission become febrile,
hypotensive,and developed [**Last Name (un) **]. She was treated with Ceftriaxone.
Ascites fluid culture was negative and as well as TEE.  Blood
cultures remained neg (previous strep viridans), urine cultures
grew yeast. Fluc was started.

CXR was concerning for pulmonary source, but had no pulmonary
symptoms.  She responded well to aggressive fluid resuscitation
and remained afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn/Azithromycin.  Gleevec was
held.

Cr trended up in the setting of infection and hypotension.
Patient stopped making urine despite aggressive  fluid
resuscitation.  DDx: ATN vs HRS. Renal US was negative for
hydronephrosis.

Stoma bleed several times that responded to pressu
