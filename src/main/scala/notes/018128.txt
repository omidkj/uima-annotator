Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center for IP intervention

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 66188**] is a 66 year old woman with history of COPD and
tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y stent, now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical Center for interventional pulmonary intervention.
She initially presented to [**Hospital 66189**] Hospital on [**2169-11-18**] with
dyspnea, sputum, and increased secretions, and was diagnosed
with community-acquired pneumonia as an outpatient, which she
subsequently failed. Sputum grew MRSA, and she was then
transferred to MMC for furhter evaluation and management.
.
Her hospital course at MMC was notable for the following
problems:
.
1. Respiratory failure/MRSA pneumonia. Transferred to MMC on
vancomycin, which was changed to linezolid when blood cultures
grew VRE. At MMC, she was difficult to ventilate, given problems
with auto-PEEP; she did well on CPAP 20/12.
.
2. Hypotension. In setting of MRSA pneumonia and VRE bacteremia.
On phenylephrine
.
3. Tracheal bleeding. Had acute bleeding from tracheostomy;
bronchoscopy demonstrated friable granulation tissue. No other
bleeding episodes.
.
4. VRE bacteremia. Culture on ??? grew VRE (drawn from PICC).
PICC pulled, CVL placed, surveillance cultures negative to date.
Linezolid to finish 7-day course on [**12-21**].
.
5. History of DVT/Pulmonary Embolism in [**2167**]. She had been on
coumadin since [**2167**] for treatment; coumadin was held, and she
was transitioned to heparin on [**12-20**] for IP procedure.
.
6. Agitation. Agitation during the hospitalization controlled
with scheduled phenobarbital and PRN pushes.
.
Per the discharge summary, at the time of discharge, her chest
x-ray demonstrated "stable appearance of multiple patchy
opacities persistent in the left lung with volume loss in the
left lung and slight shift of the mediastinum to the left,
unchanged from prior, as well as persistant left pleural
effusion".
.
On arrival to the floor, an A-line was placed and chest x-ray
was performed. Chest X-ray showed complete white out of the left
lung, consistent with complete collapse. Tidal volume was
immediately decreased, the patient received deep sedation, and
IP was called in for emergent bronchoscopy (the ICU bronchoscope
did not fit in her tracheostomy tube). Bronch demonstrated
granulation tissue on both arms of the Y-stent (L>R) and
increased mucus in left main bronchus, which was suctioned.

CXR [**12-20**]:
Leftward shift of mediastinum with complete opacification of the
left lung field new compared to previous exams. S/p trach and Y
stent. NG in good position. Right CVL line probably in good
position. Right lung grossly clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
68yF with history of COPD, tracheomalacia s/p Y-stent,
tracheostomy, recurrent MRSA pneumonia, transferred from OSH for
IP intervention and found to have collapsed left lung.  Patient
was evaluated by interventional pulmonology.  Her Y-stent was
stenosed and subsequently removed.  The patient underwent
debridement.  She was thought to have no meaningful recovery
from a pulmonary stand-point and continued to require
significant sedation to allow her to tolerate the ventilator.  A
CT of the chest was performed to evaluate for underlying
malignancy but did not show clear malignant cause of her
respiratory failure.  On [**12-27**] the family decided to provide
comfort measures only and mechanical ventilation was
discontinued and a few hours later, at 21:17, the patient
expired.  Primary cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest,
immediate cause was chronic respiratory failure.  The family was
present.
