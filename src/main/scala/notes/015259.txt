Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76F w/ h/o of asymptomatic gallstones,  CAD (LAD stenosis,
managed medically) presenting with RUQ x 5 days and fevers.

Patient arrived from [**Country 651**] last night, picked up at airport by
her son.  She had been having constant RUQ for five days, that
had improved slightly in the last two days.  Pain worsened by
food. + fevers.  Increased urinary frequency.  Of note son is a
gastroenterologist at [**Hospital3 **]/[**Hospital1 18**] and her daughter who is a
PCP at [**Hospital3 **].  They were concerned for choledocholithisais,
and gave her a dose of PO cipro.  In the morning, her daughter
saw her in clinic at [**Hospital3 **].  Urine dip was + for WBCs.
Referred to ED out concenr for choledocholithiais vs.
cholecystitis vs. UTI.

In VS were T 99 HR 69 BP 120/51 RR 18 SpO2 95%/RA. U/A positive
leuk, 50 WBC.  WBC 13.8, 84% Neutophils.  CXR - cardiomegaly,
patchy opacities, ? CHF.  RUQ U/S: fatty liver. cholelithiasis
without cholecystitis. no biliary dilatation. CTU showed severe
R pyelo, no stone.  Given ceftriaxone, 500cc fluid bolus.
desatted while laying flat for CT.  83% on RA, wheezing, RR 40.
Given Lasix 40mg IV, put on BiPAP.  EKG NSR.  Given ASA.
Initially did well on BiPAP, then became anxious took off mask.
Given 1mg ativan, put back on BiPAP 8/5 50%, satting 100%,
comfortable. Put out 400 cc urine, given 40mg IV lasix more.

On arrival to the MICU, she is on a NRB.  Still having RUQ pain,
but less dyspnea.

Pertinent Results:
[**2146-7-29**] 03:09PM   LACTATE-1.5

TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
Findings consistent with severe pyelonephritis in the right
kidney; no
evidence for stones or obstruction; a cystic lesion is probably
an incident cyst. There are gallstones and mucosal enhancement
in the gallbladder wall, presumably due to chronic inflammation
in overall context. Abnormal gluteus medius tendon insertion
onto the right greater trochanter suggesting tendonopathy.
Incidental findings of superior mesenteric artery stenosis,
fluid overload and basilar opacity probably due to atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
76 yo F h/o CAD, HTN gallstones, presented with 5 days RUQ pain
fever, found to have pyeloneprhitis.

Pt was initially in the MICU bc of concern of sepsis but then
transferred to the floors the next day.
.
Active Issues:
# Pyelonephritis: CT abdomen and pelvis revealed findings
consistent with severe pyelonephritis in the right kidney. The
patient was started on ceftriaxone in house and then we switched
her to cipro 500 [**Hospital1 **]. Urine cultures grew <10,000 colonies in
the setting of already being treated with antibiotics before
culture drawn. It was especiated to gram neg rods sensitive to
cipro.
.
# Hypoxia - Pt had evidence of fluid overload on CT possibly
from gving her too much fluids, she became hypoxic and required
4L NC. Echo showed: Normal left ventricular cavity size with
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  EF
>55 Over the course of the hospital stay she no longer required
oxygen

#Loose stool: while taking antibiotics pt developed some loose
stool. C dif was neg so the loose stool isi likely from the
antibiotics.

# Hypertension: We resumed her home antihypertensive meds
(carvedilol 25 [**Hospital1 **], Losartan 25 daily) but are holding imdur and
amlodipine which she should restart when she follows up with her
PCP

# CAD: She was continued on aspirin, statin and tricor.

# Hip Pain: She was started on her home lidoderm patch for
chronic hip pain.

Follow Up Issues:
-restart amlodipine and imdur at follow up PCP
