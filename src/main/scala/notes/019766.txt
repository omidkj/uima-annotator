History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19960**] is a 84M with pmh PVD, CAD s/p PM, AAA repair, tia,
antithrombin III deficiency who was transfered from [**Hospital1 20004**] today with abdominal distension and shortness of
breath.  This morning the pt was found by his daughter to be
tachypneic, SOB, and anxious so she took him to [**Hospital3 **].
According to the pt these symptoms have been progrevisively
worsening over the past 2 weeks. At the OSH his BNP was 890 and
he received lasix.  His INR was found to be 4.5.  He was also
given 250 cc NS. CXR showed "peripheral RUL
infiltrate/atelectasis and probable insult to peripheral
LLL/pleura."  CT scan at the OSH revealed a small fat containing
umbilical hernia with minimal fat stranding concerning for
incarceration.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] because he normally
gets his care here.  According to the patient's daughter and [**Name (NI) **]
notes the patient was recently admitted for weakness and
difficulty ambulating.  He was found to have SOB, dehydration
and hypokalemia from increased diuretic use, and abdominal
distension.  His KUB showed fecal loading in the rectum so he
was given milk of magnesia and mg Citrate.  Per report from his
daughter after his discharge from this hospitalization he was
able to pass a large BM with gas for a few days but then becamse
progressively weaker and more constipatied.  His abdomen then
became distended (his belly 3 x as big as usual) and after that
he developed worsening shortness of breath.  She also states he
has not been taking in good PO.  The pt lives alone in [**Last Name (un) **]
with 24 hr home health aid.
.
ROS: The daughter notes the pt has had + constipaiton, poor PO
intake, and SOB.  His baseline lung exam is dry rhales worse on
right and he has low BP in the low 90s. His MS baseline is a and
o x 3. The pt (and daughet) denies fevers, chest pain, diahrrea.
  His hernia is old.  He denies dysuria.  Per the daughter the
UA perfromed in [**Hospital1 **] was clean, but the foley was traumatic.

Echo [**2129-2-11**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inerior
and inferolateral walls. There is mild hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 30%). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very
small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2127-9-24**], the findings appear similar.

KUB [**2129-2-10**]:
FINDINGS: Air filled, mildly distended loops of large bowel are
present.
There is a large amount of stool within the descending and
sigmoid colon and
the rectal vault. Non-dilated loops of small bowel are
unremarkable. There
is no acute fracture or dislocation. The patient is status post
aortobiiliac
arterial stent grafting. Multiple metallic clips are present
within the lower
quadrant. Pacer wires are present in the included views of the
chest, with
leads terminating within the coronary sinus and right ventricle.
There is no
free air.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of stool within the distal colon and rectal
vault.
2. Mildly distended loops of large bowel.

CXR 2/25/0:
CHEST, AP AND LATERAL VIEWS: There is an AICD overlying the left
chest wall,
with leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle,
similar in
appearance to prior study. The lung volumes are low, with
accentuation of the
cardiomediastinal contours and bronchovascular structures.
Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable. There is mild vascular congestion that
is similar in
appearance to prior study, without evidence of consolidation.
There is no
pleural effusion of pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Stable c
