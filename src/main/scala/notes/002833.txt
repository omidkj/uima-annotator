[**2157-9-2**] FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are
obtained. Lung volumes remain low. Again noted in cardiomegaly,
pulmonary vascular congestion with  diffuse interstitial
prominence and pulmonary vascular indistinctness. There is also
a small right pleural effusion. Allowing for slight differences
in technique, there has been no change. The single lead
pacemaker is stable in course and position, with a right
subclavian approach. Aortic calcifications are again identified.
The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged but stable.
IMPRESSION: CHF, not significantly changed from [**2157-8-14**] CXR.
.
[**2157-9-5**] CXR IMPRESSION: Worsening moderate congestive heart
failure.
.
[**2157-9-6**] CXR:FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-5**],
there is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral pleural
effusions. Increasing prominence in the azygos region could
reflect right-heart failure. Single lead pacemaker device
remains in place.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M CHF, CAD s/p CABG, CKD, DM2, CHF who presents with SOB
and tachypnia thought to be due to CHF exaccerbation.
.
#SOB/Dyspnea: Patient was admitted to floor on [**9-2**] with dyspnea
secondary to CHF exacerbation as evidenced by elevated JVP,
increased weight ([**5-31**] lbs), cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular
congestion and edema on CXR, BNP of 3740, and history of
diastolic & mild systolic heart failure. Patient was ruled out
for MI. Pt had normal O2 sat on RA on admission and low Well's
score for possibility of PE.
.
On the floor, patient was diuresed starting at 60 mg IV and
increased to 100 mg IV, with not enough urine output to get
fluid off of him. At the same time, patient's dyspnea and air
hunger was progressively worsening.  To improve cardiac function
while on the floor, we added Metoprolol which dropped his BP too
low. Considered adding Losartan but BP could not tolerate it.
Added Morphine 0.5mgIV and Nitro paste to reduce preload but did
not help him symptomatically. Continued 81mg aspirin.
Progressively worsening dyspnea (Respiratory rate up to 34),
ineffective diuresis even with diuril addition, and respiratory
alkalosis prompted us to transfer him to the MICU on [**9-5**]. At
the MICU, patient received lasix drip and improved clinically
(RR=22) and diuresed more effectively (800cc). He never required
NIPPV. Patient was transferred back to the floor on [**9-7**], where
he was switched to PO Torsemide which he tolerated well.
Carvedilol was also added to regimen per Cardiology rec.  Over
the course of the hospital stay, patient lost 1.5 L with 4-5 L
still up from baseline. Prior to dicharge, pt was clinically
stable, diuresing more effectively, and weighed (143.8) less
than admission weight (146lbs) PO Torsemeide and Carvidolol were
added to patient's medication regimen at discharge.
.
#Stage 4 CKD: Cr reached 3.0 with baseline at 2.5.  GFR
according to Cockcroft-Gault Method is 15. Patient's renal
function worsened with increasing Lasix administration and
worsening CHF.  Chronic renal failure likely from to diabetes
and chronic HTN. Patient's renal function should improve due to
lower dose diuretic and improvement of CHF. Pt has urology appt
on [**9-12**]. He should have outpatient labs to be followed up by his
PCP to monitor his renal function and volume status.
.
#Anemia: Patient's Hct has been dropping more significantly
since [**2157-4-21**] for unknown reasons. Iron studies on [**7-29**] were
not c/w iron deficiency. Patient's hct decrease did not
following any worseing in renal function. Patient's haptoglobin
and reticulocytes were wnl. Patient was guiac positive, but
colonoscopy was deferred due to pt's age. When patient's Hct
dropped to 23, patient was given 1 unit of blood but did not
increase Hct appropriately. We were hesitant to give him any
more blood due to possibility of volume overload and worsening
of
