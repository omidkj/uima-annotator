Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 54-year-old male
with a history of myocardial infarction in [**2136**], two stents
placed in [**2144**], as well as diabetes, who presented after
[**9-12**] sharp substernal chest pain that woke him from sleep at
3 am on the 19th.  Patient noted diaphoresis, shortness of
breath, nausea, and radiation to his jaw, and generalized
weakness.  Patient at that time took two sublingual
nitroglycerin with no improvement in his chest pain.  The
paramedics were then called, and arrived, and gave him two
aspirin, and he was then taken to the Emergency Department.
The paramedics noted him to have a heart rate between 38 and
42 and a blood pressure that was 70/palp.  In route, he was
given atropine with no effect.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to be
bradycardic at 38 with a blood pressure of 84/50.  In the
Emergency Department, he received 6 liters of normal saline,
and his electrocardiogram noted him to have ST elevation
inferior leads.  Also of note, he had A-V dissociation.
Because of this, a temporary pacing wire was successfully
inserted as heart rate was then paced to the 90s and his
blood pressure rose.  During that time dopamine and Morphine
were also given.  Because of the patient's acute myocardial
infarction, he was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory,
and was found to have reocclusion of his previus RCA stent
which was reopened and two new stents were placed.  Also a
distal mid PDA disease was found, but it was left untreated
because of good flow.  He was also found to have equalization
of filling pressures.  Follow-up echocardiogram was ordered,
which showed no tamponade and only trace pericardial effusion
with good ejection fraction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. History of two myocardial infarctions.
4. Asthma.
5. Left knee arthritis.
6. Sleep apnea.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Two brothers with coronary artery disease
and a father with coronary artery disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin.
2. Multivitamin.
3. Glyburide.
4. Lipitor.
5. Triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide.
6. Norvasc.
7. Vitamin E.
8. Isosorbide.
9. Albuterol.
10. Metoprolol 50.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Was significant for positive tobacco use of
a 30 pack year history, no alcohol.  He is retired.

Upon admission, the patient was placed on aspirin,
Integrilin, Plavix 75, Lipitor 10, captopril 12.5 tid, and
put on an insulin-sliding scale, ranitidine [**Hospital1 **], and
ipratropium nebulizer prn.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vital signs on admission:
temperature of 98.7.  Heart rate ranged between 84-94.
Respirations ranged 17-22.  Blood pressure systolic ranged
112-144/46-83.  His pulmonary artery pressures systolic
ranged 31-40/14-21.  He was net positive 800 in with his in's
at 1,021.  Out's 220.  On examination, the patient was calm
in no apparent distress.  Head and neck examination:  His
mucosa were moist, nonicteric.  His lungs are clear to
auscultation anteriorly and posteriorly.  Cardiac
examination:  He had a regular rate, S1, S2, no murmurs or
rubs were noted.  His abdomen was obese with positive bowel
sounds, nontender, and nondistended.  His extremities:  He
had a right groin catheter at that time with good distal
pulses 1+ bilaterally, feet were warm to the touch.
Neurologic examination:  He was alert and oriented times
three.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements are intact, grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORIES:  White count of 15.6, hemoglobin 13.1,
hematocrit 38.7, platelets 233.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.9,
chloride of 105, bicarb 24, BUN 29, creatinine of 1.3, and a
glucose of 316.  His PT was 17.8, PTT 29.6, INR of 1.1.
Patient initially had a calcium of 5.4, phosphorus of 2.6,
magnesium of 1.7, which followup levels revealed a calcium of
7.7, phosphorus 4.0, magnesium of 1.8.  His CPK peaked at
2722 on the 19th at 10 am.

His echocardiogram showed left ventricle of normal size with
an ejection fraction of over 55%, small pericardial effusion,
no sinus tamponade.  His catheterization was significant for
marked increased filling pressures, a right dominant heart
with RCA occlusion of previous stents.  Two stents were
placed with TIMI-III flow.  There is also a distant occlusion
which tried to be manipulated with a wire, which could not be
reopened, and the patient was given 190 cc of contrast.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The day following his admission his
Swan-Ganz catheter was removed as well as his temporary
pacer.  His ACE inhibitor was continued, and was increased to
25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Also a beta blocker was added at that time,
metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  At that time, he was also transferred
to the floor.

On the following day, [**6-23**], he was on the floor.  He was
switched from captopril to lisinopril 10 mg q day.  On
telemetry, some ectopic beats were noted as well as a right
bundle branch block.

The following day on [**6-24**], telemetry showed decreased
frequency of these ectopic beats, but continued right bundle
branch block.  His lisinopril was increased to 15 mg q day,
and patient was discharged.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin.
2. Plavix.
3. Lipitor.
4. Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
5. Lisinopril 15 mg q day.
6. Glyburide 10 mg am, 5 mg in the pm.

Patient was also given a prescription for Accu-Chek machine
as well as glucose strips to monitor his diabetes.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was told to followup
with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 7049**].  Patient noted
that he would make an appointment within the next 1-2 weeks.
The patient also noted he also had a follow-up appointment
with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51849**], who is a cardiologist at
[**Hospital3 **].  The patient notes that he has an
appointment this coming Monday.

Patient's cardiac risk factors were discussed, and the
patient has decided to stop smoking to prevent future cardiac
events, and the patient notes that he will take his
medication as prescribed, and was told if he had any
recurrent chest pains, shortness of breath, nausea,
lightheadedness, palpitations, that he should return to the
Emergency Department.
