.
CXR: Interval worsening of the left upper lobe opacity and left
subpulmonic effusion. There is a large left hilar mass, better
appreciated on prior CT study.
.
Head CT: No acute intracranial process. Lucency involving the
inner table of the left occipital bone may represent venous [**Doctor Last Name **]
or arachnoid granulation, although metastatic disease cannot be
excluded.  Opacification of the left mastoid air cells and
middle ear opacification may represent mastoiditis in the
correct clinical context.
.
CTA Chest: Extensive left hilar tumor masses with lesions
narrowing the left upper segmental branches without evidence of
PE.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1007**] was admitted to the MICU with  likely post-obstructive
PNA with elevated WBCs, productive cough and fever.  A CTA
showed a lung mass but no clear infiltrate and was negative for
PE.  ECGs initially were without ischemic changes and troponins
were negative.  He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  He had
a thoracentesis which showed an exudate, cytology pending at
time of transfer.  He initially required Levophed for blood
pressure but was able to be weaned off on [**2177-11-16**].  He was never
intubated.  He was feeling well the day after admission and
asymptomatic with regards to the hypotension.  Cultures were all
negative.
.
He also had Afib with RVR on presentation.  He was initially
managed with Diltiazem gtt in the ED, then put on standing
Diltiazem in the MICU.  He was transitioned to Metoprolol which
was titrated up to 75 mg PO TID.  He had some occasional
episodes of rapid heart rate which were controlled with
additional doses of Metoprolol.  He was loaded with Digoxin
0.25mg PO X 3 and then put on standing Digoxin of 0.125mg PO
qday.  His rate was better controlled on transfer but
occasionally required additional Metoprolol for HR>120s.  An ECG
showed some T wave inversions compared to admission his cardiac
enzymes were negative.  He never complained of chest pain.  He
had an echocardiogram which showed moderate pericardial effusion
without signs of tamponade.There was possible but not confirmed
pericarditis causing his symptoms and ECG findings.
.
He developed neutropenia with an ANC of 540 on the day of
transfer.  He had been started on Neupogen on [**2177-11-18**].  He was
afebrile at this time and continued on broad-spectrum
antibiotics.  He was transfused 2 units PRBCs over his course in
the ICU for a hematocrit of 23.9 on [**2177-11-14**].  He was continued
on standing Zofran and Ativan for post-chemotherapy nausea and
was continued on his clinical trial medication of anamorelin.
He was put on an insulin sliding scale for a diagnosis of
diabetes for which he was not taking medication.
.
He was transferred to the Oncology service on [**2177-11-19**] with a
controlled heart rate in the 100s-120s, hemodynamically stable
and asymptomatic.
.
FLOOR COURSE:
He was transferred to OMED service and maintained on metoprolol
for rate control.  He was monitored on telemetry and although he
remained in atrial fibrillation, his ventricular rate was
well-controlled on metoprolol 75 mg Q6H.  His antibiotics were
switched to levofloxacin, and he was discharged to complete a
seven day course for presumptive CAP.  He was seen by physical
therapy who recommended discharge to home with home PT.  He
remained on the floor for two nights.  There were no concerning
episodes on telemetry and he was afebrile without chest pain or
cough.  He was no longer neutropenic at time of discharge.
Neupogen was stopped.
