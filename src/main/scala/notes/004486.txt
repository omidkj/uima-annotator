Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pleurodesis, chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69F with NSCLC multifocal adenocarcinoma with
bronchoalveolar  features diagnosed in [**2164**], with chronic
malignant R-sided pleural effusion s/p pleurodesis ([**3-/2168**]) and
a newly diagnosed left sided pleural effusion, recent admission
for Afib with RVR with extensive PMHx including COPD on 4L home
O2 and s/p bileaflet mechamic mitral valve on lovenox who was
admitted to the floor on [**2169-9-1**] after elective left-sided
pleurodesis and chest tube placement. She tolerated the
procedure well; they removed 1300mL of pleural fluid. She became
hypotensive to 75/50 immediately post-procedure, which improved
after 1 L of IVF. Her lovenox what held this morning, but was
given in the chest disease center prior to transfer to floor.
She was also given morphine, percocet and Ancef pre-procedure.
Her vital signs prior to transfer were afebrile, 111/60 84 sinus
rhythm 93% 4L. On the floor she was pleasant and alert but
mildly confused c/w prior hospitalizations.
.
On the floor, this morning patient went into atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular rate to 160s with blood pressure to the
70s systolic. Reports felt generally unwell SOB, chest pain,
mentating at baseline. She was given metoprolol 5mg then 2.5mg
IV and diltiazem 10IV x2, and no PO. She was has been given 2L
IVF and a 500cc bag is hanging. Chest tube output has been 1L
overnight (still on suction) with minimal urine output (100cc
since midnight, concentrated). Foley placed this AM. She is on
4L O2, which is her baseline. Access is port and PIV. Vitals on
transfer: HR: 92-102 AFIB, BP in 83/60, 94% on 4L NC.

Brief Hospital Course:
69yo F with NSCLC with chronic malignant R-sided pleural
effusion s/p pleurodesis ([**3-/2168**]), newly diagnosed left sided
pleural effusion s/p elective pleurodesis and chest tube
placement on [**2169-9-1**], hospital course complicated by atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and asymptomatic
hypotension requiring ICU admission.
.
#PLEURAL EFFUSION: She has a chronic right sided malignant
pleural effusion and was found to have a new left sided pleural
effusion, which was likely due to progressive disease. She
underwent palliative pleurodesis and chest tube placement by
interventional pulmonology. She continued to have high volume
output from her chest tube so on hospital day 4 she received an
injection of talc. Her chest tube output decreased, and the
chest tube was ultimately removed. She began to have increased
cough productive of purulent sputum the day after the tube was
removed, so she was started on Mucomyst nebs and guafenisen
which provided some relief.
.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: She has a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation maintained on dual AV nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] therapy and on
hospital day two went into atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular rate and asymptomatic hypotension. She developed
shortness of breath during episodes of RVR. She was started on
amiodarone (bolus, drip, then PO) and converted to sinus rhythm.
She went back into atrial fibrillation with RVR twenty four
hours later during repositioning. She was given another bolus of
amiodarone and started on metoprolol, after which she converted
to sinus rhythm. She was started on po amiodarone, 400mg [**Hospital1 **].
Upon discharge she will have 2.5 more days at [**Hospital1 **] dosinf for her
amiodarone load. [**9-11**] she will start 400mg daily for 1 week,
to be followed by a maintenance dose of 200mg daily.
.
#HYPOTENSION: She became hypotensive in the setting of atrial
fibrillation with RVR. This was likely due to hypovolemia and
her tachyarrhythmia. She was given IV fluid and required
vasopressors for <24 hours. Her cardiac enzymes were normal.
Pulsus paradoxus was within normal limits. Blood and urine
cultures were obtained and she was started on ceftriaxone for
UTI. In preparation for discharge, she was changed from
ceftriaxone to po cefpodoxime.
.
# DELIRIUM: During transfer to the ICU she was quite agitated
with reduced orientation and inattention consistent with
delirium. She was given IV haldol 2.5prn for agitation as she
was trying to physically remove her port. With treatment of the
hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and UTI her agitation
improved. She was transitioned to comfort care.
.
# COPD: She was continued on supplemental oxygen and ipratropium
nebs for comfort. She has a nebulizer at home and will be
discharged with DuoNebs for shortness of breath or wheezing.
.
# MECHANICAL MVR. She was continued on Lovenox for
anticoagulation as preventing an ischemic event was considered
part of palliation.
.
# GOALS OF CARE: The MICU team met with the health care proxy
who recognized the patients chronic, progressive medical
condition. The major concern was patient comfort and safe
transition to home. The patient and family met with the
palliative care team. Her code status was made DNR/DNI and
comfort measures only. The patient voiced desire to go home
rather than to a nursing facility or inpatient Hospice, and so
arrangements were made for the patient to go home with 24 hour
nursing care and Hospice services.
