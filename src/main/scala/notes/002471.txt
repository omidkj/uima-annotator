SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Hospital3 **] with
her family. She denies tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: No acute distress. Oriented
x2. No JVD or carotid bruits. Heart is irregular/irregular
rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdominal exam is remarkable for a ventral hernia reducible.
Extremities are no edema. Rectal exam is Guaiac negative.
Pulse exam shows Dopplerable right axillofem graft. Femoral
pulses are Dopplerable, monophasic bilaterally, popliteal on
the right is monophasic Dopplerable signal on the left
absent. The DP on the right is triphasic, Dopplerable and the
PT is absent. On the left the DP and PT are absent
bilaterally. The left leg is mottled with sensory intact and
diminished motor function. The patient is admitted to the
vascular service now for further evaluation and treatment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
emergency room and admitted to the vascular service. She was
begun on vanco, levofloxacin for antibiotic care. Her
preoperative medications were continued. She did have some
EKG changes with ST depressions in V4-V5, questionable
myocardial infarction. The patient's admitting CKs were 387
and over the next 48 hours CK was 209. CK MBs were 3 and 4.
Troponin levels were 0.2. Cardiology was requested to see the
patient for preoperative assessment for evaluation.
Recommendations-she was a high surgical candidate with known
severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with a semi-compensated left
ventricular function. They felt that no further cardiac
workup was indicated at this time. The patient should be
restarted on her Lasix, spironolactone should be added to her
regimen and increase from 12.5 to 25 mg daily with monitoring
of K. Diltiazem should be discontinued secondary to
myocardial suppression, a beta blockade, Toprol, should be
advanced to 150 mg a day. Digoxin should be changed to 0.125
mg per day and gemfibrozil should be changed to fenofibrate.
The patient's Coumadin was held and she was placed on IV
heparin for anticoagulation for a chronic atrial
fibrillation. Long discussions with the family to determine
plan of action, arteriogram to see if we can reconstruct or
just undergo amputation. The patient's family was undecided.
The [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3208**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4869**] was consulted for diabetic management. The
patient was preopped on [**2111-4-15**] for anticipated left
AKA and underwent a left AKA without complication on [**2111-4-15**]. She was transferred to the PACU in stable
condition. Postoperatively, she remained hemodynamically
stable. Her postoperative crit was 31.1, BUN 15, creatinine
0.7. The patient remained intubated overnight and was
transferred to the SICU for continued monitoring and care.
She was weaned overnight and extubated. She remained
hemodynamically stable. Her physical examination was
unremarkable. Her dressing was clean, dry, and intact. She
was transferred to the VICU for continued care. She required
readjustment in her regular insulin dose for her
hyperglycemia with slow improvement.

On postoperative day #1 the patient was converted to p.o.
medications. Ambulation to the chair was begun. Heparin was
restarted and Warfarin was reinstituted. Her antibiotics were
discontinued on postoperative day #2. Her Swan line was
converted to CVL on postoperative day #2. She continued to
require Lasix for diuresis. The A-line was discontinued.
Hematocrit was 28.7, BUN 11, creatinine 0.7. She continued to
be followed by the vascular service and her primary care
physician.

Physical therapy evaluated the patient on postoperative day
#3. The recommendations were that the patient could be
discharged to home with home physical therapy and 24-hour
care. The family is aware of this and this was their
decision. A repeat echocardiogram will be obtained prior to
the patient's discharge to determine her left ventricular
function.

On postoperative day #5 she continued to do well, was
afebrile. Her left flap was warm, pink, without erythema. The
right DP and PT were Dopplerable signals only. The IV heparin
was continued until her INR was greater than 2.0. The patient
will continue with diuresis. She is at baseline. Will be
planning discharge to home with services in the next 24
hours.
