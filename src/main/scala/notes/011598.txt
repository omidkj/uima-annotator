History of Present Illness:
65 year-old male with a complicated history transferred from
[**Hospital3 2783**] where he presented following a syncopal
episode and left hand pain. Per patient he went to the bathroom
and on his way back to his room, he felt lightheaded and had a
syncopal episode and fell on his left hand. He denies preceding
chest pain, SOB or palpitations. His wife heard some noise,
found him on the floor, and helped him back to his room. He
denies post-event confusion. He has a history of similar
syncopal events with dizziness with standing. For this reason he
uses a wheelchair. He is usually able to make the trip to the
bathroom by walking unassisted.
.
This morning, he awoke with pain in his left hand, with swelling
and redness. The swelling worsening significantly during the
course of the day, and he presented to [**Hospital3 2783**].
There his was INR 4.7 and his hand X-ray negative. With concern
for compartment syndrome, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.
.
Initial [**Hospital1 18**] ED eval notable for VS T 98.3, HR 90, BP 140/70,
RR 18, Sat 100% on 2L. He was seen by Plastic surgery, who did
not feel that he was having a compartment syndrome. He was also
seen by the medicine consult service and cleared for OR if
needed. He was admitted to the medical service for serial exams
and monitoring.
.
In the am of [**1-6**] pt was noted to have SBP in the 60's, O2 sat
90's this AM when being evaluated by short call team. Pt was put
on 4L NC with improvement of sat to mid 90's, and ABG
7.32/50/71. He was bolused 2L NS with slight improvement of
blood pressure to 80's systolic (from 140's at admission). He
got 2 units of FFP and 5 SQ Vit K to correct his INR of 6. Pt
remaines AAO x 3. Ddx included hypotension related to narcotics
(2 mg morphine + percocet, w/ h/o low BP to narcs per his
wife/PCP), hypovolemia (but not fluid responsive), sepsis (given
granulating abdominal wound), and blood loss given elevated INR.
No pressors were given. 1 dose of Narcan was given with
improvement in SBP's to 100's. Pt was subsequently transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where he was observed for a day and found to have
improved hypotension, an INR of 2.2, an ABG was done and found
to be 7.32/50/71. The patient mentated at baseline and had no
increase in O2 requirement. He is subsequently being transferred
back to the floor.

13. History of lens transplant in right eye secondary to

Last cath in [**2-/2198**]: LMCA normal. LAD occluded . The LCX was
widely patent and the stented sites were open. At the origin of
the OM3, there was 50% restenosis. The RCA stents were widely
patent. LIMA-LAD patent.

Cath ([**12-5**])
The LAD had a proximal 60% lesion, a mid 80% lesion, and distal
competitive flow from the LIMA-LAD. The LCX stents were widely
patent with normal flow. The RCA had a proximal 60% lesion at a
[**Last Name (un) 29846**] crook, with diffuse mid disease up to a sub-total
occlusion in the mid vessel. The distal vessel supplied a lower
AM/PDA and a RPL branch. 2. Successful stenting of the RCA was
performed with overlapping 2.5 x 28 mm and 3.0 X 13 mm Cypher
(drug-eluting) stents, post-dilated using 2.5 and 3.25 mm NC
balloons respectively. There was <10% residual stenosis, no
angiographically-apparent dissection, and normal flow (see
PTCA Comments).

L Wrist X rays [**1-5**]:  IMPRESSION: 1. No fracture or dislocation
within the hand.  2. Diffuse soft tissue swelling involving the
dorsum of the hand. Focal round lesion noted within the
subcutaneous tissues of the dorsal aspect of the left hand,
which may represent a hematoma or focal lesion such as a
sebaceous cyst.
.
Ct head [**1-5**] IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**1-6**] The left ventricle is enlarged. No overt CHF or active
infiltrates. No pneumothorax identified

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 65 yo male with [**Hospital 23789**] transferred from OSH
following a syncopal event and ? compartment syndrome in left
hand is setting of supratherapeutic INR, now with hypotension.
.
HYPOTENSION: Intial ddx included hypotension related to
narcotics (2 mg morphine + percocet), hypovolemia, sepsis, and
blood loss given elevated INR. He did not have evidence of GIB,
is afebrile, and continued to make good urine output (although
evidence of urinary retention w/ foley placement). Given his
clear history of low BP in setting of narcotics and improvement
with Narcan, this seemed like the most likely etiology. We held
further antihypertensives and narcotics.  His BP remained stable
and he was discharged a day after transfer back to the floor
without any new symptoms.  He was discharged off home BP meds
with planned follow up with PCP.
.
LEFT HAND HEMATOMA: Seen by plastics, and the patient appeared
to have improvement in swelling and had no evidence of
compartment syndrome. We continued dressing changes per
plastics, and OT followed.  We followed INR s/p Vit K and FFP
were given (see HPI), which remained WNL.  He was discharged
with a stable hematoma and no evidence of compartment syndrome.
.
SYNCOPE: By history pt had post-micturitional syncope, with
history of prior similar episodes. Suspect vasovagal syncope.
Not orthostatic at OSH. EKG without acute changes, 2 sets of
