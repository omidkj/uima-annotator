Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Redo sternotomy/MVR923mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical)/TV repair(28mm
annuloplasty band) [**2114-11-26**]


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 41yo woman with h/o DM type [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 30749**] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**] in
[**2112**] (congenital bicuspid valve) who presents for right heart
catheterization in anticipation of MVR.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 23609**] was admitted 1 month ago to [**Hospital1 18**] with acute diastolic
heart failure. TTE done during that admission demonstrated
moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation; increased
from 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] from [**2113-9-22**]. Although echocardiogram
showed evidence of possible former rheumatic heart disease, the
underlying cause of her valvular dysfunction is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **]
was diuresed with lasix with improvement in her fluid status and
dyspnea. She now presents for MVR.
.
Patient reports that she has been "exhausted all the time" since
her discharge. She is dyspneic with minimal exertion, such as
walking down the [**Doctor Last Name **]. +Orthopnea, uses 3 pillows at night.
Denies PND or ankle edema. +8 pound weight loss in last month,
which she attributes to poor appetite. She does admit to
depression, and states she is not sleeping well, though she is
optimistic about improving after surgery.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative except as noted in HPI.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.
