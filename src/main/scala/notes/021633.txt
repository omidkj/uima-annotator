HI[**Last Name (STitle) 2710**]OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78 year-old female
with known aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease who
had several episodes of congestive heart failure, most
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] at
the end of [**Month (only) 958**].  Patient underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed an aortic valve area of 1.25 cm sq, peak
gradient of 57 ejection fraction of 66 percent, 40 percent
left main disease, 80 percent LAD disease, 60 percent RCA
disease, 70 percent PDA disease.  Echocardiogram showed 1 to
2+ mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic stenosis, 3+
tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Aortic stenosis.  2) Coronary
artery disease.  3) Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4) History of right breast carcinoma.  5) Hypertension.  6)
Hypercholesterolemia.  7) Osteoarthritis.  8) Congestive
heart failure.  9) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
10) Obesity.  11) Skin cancer.  12) Right internal carotid
artery 60 to 69 stenosis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1) Status post right mastectomy for
breast cancer in [**2101**].  2) Left cataract surgery.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q day.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q day.
4.  Glyburide 7.5 mg p.o. q A.M. and 5 mg p.o. q P.M.
5.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q day.
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q day.
7.  Ipratropium inhaler 2 puffs q.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Patient is allergic to sulfa which gives her a
rash.

[**Last Name (STitle) 2708**]was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**4-22**] and was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for an aortic valve replacement with a 19 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]
[**Doctor Last Name **] Magnum pericardial valve and a coronary artery bypass
graft times one with LIMA to LAD.  Please see operative note
for further details.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 145
minutes.  Crossclamp time was 120 minutes.  Patient was
transported to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
On the first postoperative evening the patient was noticed by
the nurse to not be moving the left upper extremity and
shortly thereafter the patient had a witnessed generalized
tonic clonic seizure.  Neurology was consulted.  Patient went
for an emergent CT scan which was negative for intracranial
bleed.  Patient was loaded with Dilantin and patient was
started on Neo-Synephrine which was titrated for a systolic
blood pressure 130 to 140.  Patient had another generalized
tonic clonic seizure the morning of postoperative day number
one for which she was given Ativan and more Dilantin.
Patient remained intubated due to her unstable neurologic
status.  Patient was paced to maintain adequate cardiac
output.  By neurologic examination by postoperative day
number two patient was opening eyes to stimuli and was
nodding her head to questions, spontaneously moving right
side, right upper and right lower extremity, withdrawing her
left leg to painful stimuli and no movement of her left upper
extremity.  The patient's pacing wires were removed on
postoperative day number two and patient underwent an MRI of
the head.  The MRI showed significant white matter
abnormality suggestive of edema accompanied by sulcal
narrowing and gyral fullness in the right frontal lobe as
well as seizure activity.  Neurology felt that this was
suspicious for an old cerebrovascular accident and not
indicative of a new ischemic event.  Patient continued on
Neo-Synephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure.

On postoperative day number two the patient developed rapid
atrial fibrillation, was placed on amiodarone infusion.  On
postoperative day number three patient was weaned and
extubated from the mechanical ventilation without difficulty.
Patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.
The patient was started on diuretics and low dose Lopressor
for rate control of the atrial fibrillation.  By
postoperative day number four patient was started on a
heparin drip due to the atrial fibrillation which was cleared
by neurology.  They felt there was no contraindication to
heparinization.  Patient continued to have left sided
weakness, left lower extremity more so than left upper
extremity.  On postoperative day number seven it was noted
that the patient had an area of warmth, erythema in the right
antecubital fossa at the site of a previous intravenous
thought to be due to a thrombophlebitis.  Patient was started
on Kefzol and warm packs with subsequent improvement.  On
postoperative day number eight cardiology consultation was
obtained for management of the atrial fibrillation and
potential cardioversion.  Patient was sedated by
anesthesiology on postoperative day number eight and was
cardioverted from atrial fibrillation to sinus bradycardia
with significant improvement in the patient's blood pressure.
However, patient continued to require Neo-Synephrine to
maintain systolic blood pressure greater than 115 which was
the recommendation of the neurology team.  As patient was
being started on Coumadin due to the atrial fibrillation
discussion was had with neurology team for the interaction of
Coumadin, amiodarone and Dilantin and it was decided to
transition patient from Dilantin to Keppra which was done
over the next couple of days and the Dilantin was
discontinued.  Patient continued on Kefzol, had a normal
white blood cell count and by postoperative day number 11
patient had been weaned off her Neo-Synephrine with adequate
systolic blood pressure and patient was transferred from the
Intensive Care Unit to the regular part of the hospital.
Patient continued to receive Coumadin.  She remained in sinus
rhythm.  Patient was working with physical therapy and was
only able to ambulate approximately 150 feet and it was
determined that patient would benefit from a stay at short
term rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Maximum temperature 99.2, pulse 74
and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 118/60, respiratory rate 20,
room air oxygen saturation 96 percent.  Patient's weight on
[**5-5**] is 78.3.  Preoperatively patient weight 82 kilograms.
Neurologically patient is awake, alert and oriented times
three.  Patient has equal grip strength bilateral upper
extremities.  Patient's left lower extremity hip flexion and
extension strength is 4 out of 5 and on the right it is 5 out
of 5.  Patient's plantar and dorsiflexion is 4 out of 5 on
the left and on the right is 5 out of 5.  Patient has had no
further postoperative seizures.  Heart was regular rate and
rhythm without rub or murmur.  Breath sounds are clear
bilaterally.  Abdomen is obese, positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Patient is tolerating a regular
diet and having normal bowel movements.  Sternal incision is
clean and dry.  Steri-Strips are intact.  Sternum is stapled.
There is no erythema or drainage.  Bilateral lower
extremities have trace to 1+ pitting edema.  Patient's right
antecubital fossa is no longer erythematous.
