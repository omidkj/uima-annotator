Micro: No growth on urine, pleural fluid, blood.
.
TTE: 1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND: No comparisons. The liver is normal in
echotexture and without focal masses. There is no intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The aorta is of normal
caliber throughout its visualized course. The pancreas and
spleen are unremarkable. The gallbladder contains multiple
stones, but no distention or wall edema. The common bile duct is
normal measuring 5 mm. The main portal vein is patent with
appropriate direction of flow. The right kidney measures 10.9
cm, and the left kidney measures 11.1 cm. There is no renal
mass, stone, or hydronephrosis. There is no free fluid.

This study is limited due to patient body habitus.

IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
.
[**1-20**] CTA:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are
multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. For example, two
adjacent right paratracheal nodes measure 16 x 12 and 15 x 13 mm
in axial dimensions, respectively. More superiorly, a right
upper paratracheal lymph node measures 15 x 13 mm, and a
subcarinal node measures 28 x 17 mm. There is also
lymphadenopathy in the right hilum, with a node measuring up to
18 x 11 mm. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.

It is difficult to assess for left hilar lymphadenopathy because
of the presence of a partially collapsed left lung. The heart,
great vessels, and pericardium are unremarkable. There is no
pericardial effusion or evidence of pulmonary embolism.

There is a moderately large pneumothorax in the left hemithorax,
in spite of the presence of a chest tube. There is also a small
left pleural effusion. In the left hemithorax, neither the lower
or upper lobe has fully reexpanded and both appear surrounded by
visceral pleural thickening, particularly the upper lobe. There
are also atelectatic changes within the residual lobes and
ground glass opacity.

In the right lung, there are multiple areas of ground glass
opacity and septal thickening. In comparison to the chest
radiographs, this appearance has progressed over two days, and
although the appearance is nonspecific by imaging, pulmonary
edema is suspected.

Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Persistent hydropneumothorax on the left, in spite of the
presence of the chest tube.

2. Partially collapsed left upper and lower lobes, which are
surrounded by visceral pleural thickening. The differential for
this appearance includes metastatic disease, primary lung
cancer, mesothelioma, and potentially lymphoma.

3. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.

4. Diffuse patchy ground glass opacities and septal thickening
in the right lung, progressive over two days, which may
represent pulmonary edema, given its rapid onset.
.
Pleural fluid cytology: Non-small cell carcinoma, consistent
with pulmonary primary; see note.
Note:  The tumor cells are positive for CK7 and TTF-1 and
negative for CK20.  This profile is consistent with a pulmonary
primary.
.
Pleural biopsy: Pending

Brief Hospital Course:
At the time admission to the MICU following previous hospital
course documented in HPI, the patient was experiencing an acute
exacerbation of her SOB.  CTA was obtained c/w lymphangitic
spread vs. pulmonary edema.  Given the temporal relation to
chest tube placement, it was hoped that the patient was
experiencing re-expansion pulmonary edema that could be improved
with lasix diuresis.  The patient did initially experience some
relief with lasix, suggesting that this was at least a component
of her shortness of breath.  Given diffuse disease evident in
the lung, infiltrate could not be radiographically ruled out, so
the patient was maintained on vancomycin, azithromycin and zosyn
for broad coverage given her severe ilness.
.
On the patient's second day in the MICU, cytology returned on
his efussion for NSCLC, thus stage IIIB "wet" / stage IV.  No
dominant mass was clearly visible on CT, raising the possibility
of breast cancer.  Oncology was consulted and discussed case and
its prognosis with family and MICU team.  However, given
patient's extremely poor functional status with ongoing hypoxia,
the MICU team did not feel that she would be an appropriate
candidate for chemotherapy, even palliative, at this time.  A
decision was made to await the results of pleural biopsy, which
remain pending at time of transfer.  At the time of diagnosis of
metastatic cancer, the patient decided that she wished to be
DNR/DNI.
.
On the patient's second MICU day, she developed afib w/RVR to
130s.  This was poorly rate controlled with IV boluses of
metoprol, followed by diltiazem, so the patient was started on a
diltiazem drip.  The patient remained in the 120s, so amiodarone
was loaded in an attempt at rhythm control, and to assist
w/nodal blockade.  Ca and atropine were maintained at the
bedside given use of multiple nodal blocking agents, but the
patient never converted to sinus.
.
The larger MICU plan of care had been to reverse any treatable
causes of shortness of breath, notably infiltrates via
antiobiotics, pulmonary edema with diuretics, and COPD
exacerbation with steroids, atrovent and albuterol.  TTE w
