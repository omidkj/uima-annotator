History of Present Illness:
86 year old male with h/o cryptogenic cirrhosis, CHF, Afib, DM,

presents with altered mental status, fatigue, lethargy and
jaundice.

At baseline he is independent with a walker and was active
yesterday.  By the evening, he had decreased responsiveness and
was not answering questions during the night.  He has improving
petechiae all over his body from a recent vasculitis.  Denies

lactulose, 3L NS, and started on a dopamine gtt.  Treated with
warmed IVF and a bear hugger.  Was with daughter and son-in-law.
 [**Name (NI) **] was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

Triggered on arrival for hypotension with BP's 80/60.  Exam
notable for toxic appearing male with petechial rash c/w known
leukocytoclastic vasculitis.  FAST u/s was negative.  A right IJ
was placed.  He was changed to a levophed gtt.  Given 500cc in
our ED.  Does have mildly positive UA.  Considered LP but didn't
due to lack of leukocytosis or fever.  Considered hepatic

110/47 19 100%4L. Lactate wnl.

Pt was recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 58629**] for "acute liver
decompensation." Recent illness in [**State **] and newly dx'd liver
disease with jaundice, ascites, and portal thrombosis. Was
cardiac catheterized [**4-17**] in consideration of AS causing
anasarca results showed: severe aortic stenosis (gradient of
53mmHg, valve area of 0.85cm2), mildly elevated filling
pressures, mild pulmonary hypertension but insufficient to
explain the degree of portal hypertension seen on exam. He was
started on lasix, spironolactone and rifaximin. He followed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23804**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]. First hepatology clinic visit [**5-2**]
(limited note) started lactulose, creat 1.7, bili 2.8, BP
100/60, slow afib. New PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] ([**Doctor Last Name **]) on Friday creat 2.3,
ammonia 90, wbc wnl, bili 1.3, INR 1.3. Family was unable to
afford rifaximin as outpt. New medications include vitamin E and

Radiology:
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2197-5-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right internal jugular line in upper to mid SVC.
2. Low lung volumes limit evaluation for pneumonia or small
nodules. If
desired, repeat study can be performed.
3. Acute fractures of right lateral 6th-8th ribs.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of [**2197-5-14**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially distended gallbladder, with moderate wall
thickening (possibly
reactive). HIDA scan could be considered to evaluate for early
acute or
chronic cholecystitis.
2. Cirrhosis, without detectable portal venous flow.

GALLBLADDER SCAN Study Date of [**2197-5-15**]
IMPRESSION:
Gallbladder filling and excretion is visualized with no evidence
of acute
cholecystitis.

TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT Study Date of [**2197-5-16**]
FINDINGS: No definite evidence of bony abnormality or gas in
soft tissues.  If there is serious clinical concern for
osteomyelitis, MRI would be the next imaging procedure.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT) Study Date of [**2197-5-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT.
2. Abnormal right groin Doppler could be caused by a small
arteriovenous
fistula. Suggest pelvic CTA to look for possible fistulous
communication in this region.
