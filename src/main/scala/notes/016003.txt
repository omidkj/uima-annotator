History of Present Illness:
99-yo-woman w/ h/o gastritis and GI bleed was referred from
[**Hospital3 2558**] today w/ hematemesis and melena. She is normally
alert and oriented at baseline, but was discovered this
afternoon by NH staff to be lethargic w/ "garbled speech," not
responding to questions. At this time she was hypotensive w/ SBP
in 60s and HR 122. She vomited black, coffee ground material x 2
this afternoon, and at 21:45 had "large bloody" stool, prompting
referral to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, she was initially hypotensive w/ SBP in the 70s and
HR in the 120s. She was transfused 2 units PRBCs, resulting in
increased BP to 90s/40s, HR 90. She was intubated to facilitate
NG lavage and for airway protection; NG lavage returned minimal
coffee ground material w/ no red blood. She is now admitted to
the MICU for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with DM type 2, HTN, angina,
anemia, and diastolic CHF admitted from the ED w/ GI bleed.
.
# GI: Patient found to have hematemesis and melena at [**Hospital **], and also found to be hypotensive in to SBP of 70's in the
ED at [**Hospital1 18**].  NG lavage returned minimal coffee ground substance
but no bright red blood.  Patient initially had hematcrit down
to 35 from baseline of 40, but received 2 units PRBC and
hematocrit was stable for 3 consecutive days.  GI consulted and
recommended deferring endoscopy until other issues are resolved,
as her hematocrit appears stable.  She does not take NSAIDS;
platelets and INR are normal.  Patient started on pantoprazole
and antihypertensive medications held.  NG tube was placed
peri-extubation and tube feeds were initiated.  The patient was
transferred to the medical floor and her HCT remained stable,
but her stools were consistently guiac positive.  She may
require out patient EGD and colonoscopy if the risks of these
procedures in a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman outweight the benefit.  For
now she should continue the lansoprazole she was on as an
outpatient (changed to liquid form given her difficulty with
some pills).
.
# Respiratory - Intubated on [**2190-4-4**] in setting of hemodynamic
instability. Extubated on [**2190-4-6**] with stable blood gases.
.
# Hypotension: GI Blood loss vs. sepsis from UTI. Patient found
to have decreased adrenal reserve and started on phenylephrine
and hydrocortisone/fludricortisone.  These were discontinued
after resolution of hypotension.  After transfer to the medical
floor she had no further hypotensive episodes.
.
# UTI: Initially, patient was started on empiric broad-spectrum
coverage (Vancomycin, Pip-Tazo, Levofloxacin) for urosepsis.
Follow-up cultures demonstrated E. coli, and antibiotics were
switched to ciprofloxacin.  She completed a 7-day course of
ciprofloxacin which ended on [**2190-4-11**].
.
# Acute renal failure: Due to prerenal azotemia in the setting
of GI bleed/Sepsis. Renal ultrasound negative for stones or
obstruction/hydronephrosis.  Resolved with IV fluid hydration
and normalization of blood pressure.
.
# DVT: She developed some left lower extremity edema despite
being on subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots.  An ultrasound
showed a partially occluding clot in the left common femoral
vein.  She was started on heparin gtt and will be discharged on
enoxaparin which she should continue for at least 3 months.  Of
note, she had a DVT in [**2187**] and was placed on coumadin which was
complicated by hemothorax.  She must be monitored closely for
complications from the blood thinners.
.
# DM type 2: Controlled with diet as outpatient.  Covered with
sliding scale while in house.
.
# HTN: Controlled with metoprolol, amlodipine, furosemide and
lisinopril as outpatient, but these were held in setting of
hypotension.  On the medical floor she was receiving metoprolol
and occasional furosemide, but her SBP were elevated. She will
be discharged on metoprolol, furosemide and lisinopril. The
lisinopril has been decreased to 20mg daily from 40mg.  Her
medications may need to be titrated further as an outpatient
depending on her blood pressure.
.
# Anemia: Initially lower than baseline, but has been stable at
38-40 for past 3 days.  Given the blood thinners, and anemia,
she should have her CBC checked every Friday and Tuesday.
.
# Back pain: Chronic, controlled with tylenol.
.
# Depression: Continued home mirtazipine.
.
# FEN:  She was initially fed through the NG tube.  On the floor
she pulled out the NG tube.  As her mental status improved to
baseline, she ate small meals as long as they were fed to her
and she was given encouragement.
   She will need her electrolytes checked every Friday and
Tuesday paying attention especially to her potassium (restarting
furosemide and potassium was low in house).
