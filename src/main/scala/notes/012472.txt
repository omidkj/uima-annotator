Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the CCU from the cath lab with stable vitals
on [**6-25**].  Echo on [**6-25**] show mildly depressed EF (35-40%) with
hypokinesis of mid and distal anterior septum, anterior wall,
and apex, and so pt was maintained on heparin anticoagulation,
then switched over to coumadin.  Pt remained in CCU [**6-26**] and the
morning of [**6-27**] with vitals remaining stable, no arrhythmias,
and cardiac enzymes consistently trending downward and so was
