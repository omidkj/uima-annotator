Service:  MICU

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory distress.
2.  Respiratory failure.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  COPD exacerbation.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 79 year old with
multiple medical problems including a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation who was
recently discharged from [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Country **] on [**2130-9-8**] for a
history of cellulitis who presented to the Emergency Room on
[**2130-9-20**] with increasing dyspnea times one day.  The
morning of admission the patient was without complaints per
the nursing home staff, however having increasing shortness
of breath throughout the day.  Patient noted to be
unresponsive at 1:45 p.m. and vital signs recorded at the
time were 96.9, 88, 102/66, 22.  Patient became more
responsive with an O2 sat of 85% prior to transfer to the
Emergency Room.  Wheezes at the time were noted which
decreased with Combivent nebulizer treatment in the Emergency
Room.

In the Emergency Room patient noted to be in moderate
respiratory distress.  O2 sats were noted to be in the 80s on
face mask.  Patient also noted to have periorbital cyanosis
at nursing home.  Patient was intubated in the Emergency Room
secondary to decreased O2 saturations and persistent
respiratory distress.  An arterial blood gas performed at the
time demonstrated a pH of 7.27, 54, 98 on 60% FIO2, AC 12 x
600.  Patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for continued care.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Former smoker; quit
two years ago.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 17, differential
neutrophils 75, lymphs 21, monocytes 2.  Urinalysis:  Large
blood, positive protein, greater than 50 red blood cells, 0
to 2 white blood cell count.  Electrolytes 142/3.1, 107/19;
BUN 27/2.2, baseline is 1.2-1.5; glucose 162, INR 3.7; ABG
7.27, 54, 98; troponin 0.14; lactate 1.2.

Chest x-ray:  Diffuse patchy linear infiltrates, question
loculated effusion.

EKG:  MAT at 99, 0.5 mm ST segment depressions in V4, V5, low
voltage in limb leads, Q-waves in 3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory failure:  Patient presented to the Emergency
Room with respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Patient
was extubated on [**2130-9-22**].  Patient's respiratory failure
was considered secondary to COPD flare up versus secondary to
possible pneumonia.  Patient was continued on Levofloxacin.
Patient was also provided with Vancomycin.  Patient's sputum
subsequently grew up Staph aureus.  Staph aureus is likely a
colonization.  Patient's x-ray reportedly is baseline.
Patient was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent.  Patient's
white blood cell count subsequently decreased to 10.6 by
[**2130-9-26**].

2.  Troponin:  Patient presented with troponin 0.14.
Patient's enzymes were cycled.  Patient's troponin decreased
in nature.  There was likely secondary to demand ischemia.
Patient showed no EKG changes.

3.  Renal failure:  Patient with elevated creatinine from
baseline.  Patient's creatinine responded to volume.
Patient's creatinine was 1.5 on [**2130-9-26**].

4.  Cellulitis:  Patient with a history of cellulitis.
Patient's cellulitis was actually improved on presentation.
However, given possible decompensation, Vancomycin was
initiated.

5.  MAT atrial fibrillation:  Patient with history of MAT
atrial fibrillation.  Blood pressures not provided given
history of COPD.  Patient is on Coumadin; initially held,
then reintroduced throughout his hospitalization.  Patient's
Coumadin level should be checked as outpatient INR.

6.  Heme:  Patient with baseline anemia.  Patient anemic in
physical exam.  Patient transfused two units on [**2130-9-22**]
after hematocrit of 24.  Patient responded appropriately.
Patient with history of guaiac-positive stools.  Patient
should likely receive an outpatient colonoscopy per primary's
team.

7.  Patient with a history of opiate use.  Secondary to
opiate use, multiple fractures.

8.  Cellulitis:  Further assessed with a CT.  A CT performed
demonstrated a fluid density along the anteromedial skin
surface which was most consistent with edema.  However, the
possibility of a fluid conduction could not be excluded by
Radiology.  The patient, however, subsequently resumed
refusing MRI.  The patient's symptoms improved, and it was
felt that an MRI would be low yield, and the patient did
refuse the test.

9.  Muscle:  Patient complained of shoulder pain.  Therefore,
an x-ray was performed on [**2130-9-25**].  The [**2130-9-25**] x-ray
of the left shoulder showed diffuse osteopenia
catheter-imposed humeral diaphysis most likely representing a
PICC line.  No fractures noted.  The humeral head was
subluxed superiorly consistent with the chronic rotator cuff
tear.  Access midline was placed on [**2130-9-25**] in the left
arm, code full.

10.  Gastrointestinal:  Of note, patient during his
hospitalization, developed possible epididymitis.  Urology
was consulted.  Patient's symptoms resolved.

11.  Infectious Diseases:  Patient with diarrhea.  Patient's
C. difficile titer was sent.  First one was negative.
Additional two should be sent.  Patient was empirically
initiated on Metronidazole.  Patient's symptoms have
improved.
