History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94952**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with ESRD on HD who comes in with
3 days of intermittent RUQ pain (chronic), + nausea, no
vomiting.  She visited her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] documented a T about 100 and
was concerned about abd pain on exam.  He sent her to the ED
where she denied current abd pain.  She was noted to have a
slight leukocytosis, and had a CXR showing chronic effusions but
better than usual.  KUB was negative.  UA with epi's.  During
her stay, she then spiked a fever to 102 and her pressure
dropped down to 80 systolic.  Got .5L fluid x 2 with no
improvement in her pressures.  A right femoral line was placed
after failure to place a right IJ. She received a dose of vanc
and cipro.  An abdominal CT was largely unremarkable.

Of note, she was recently started on dialysis in the middle of
[**Month (only) 359**] with a HD catheter placed.  She was also seen 2 weeks
ago for LE cellulitis in the ED.  She was given a 10 day course
of levofloxacin.

Vitals in ED: T 102  HR 65  BP 84/36  97% on 4LNC  RR 24

On the floor, she is comfortable and pleasant.  She denies SOB,
f/c, chest pain, cough, HA.  She reports urinary frequency with
incomplete voiding, but denies dysuria.

Micro Data:
[**2184-10-19**] blood cultures: 4/4 bottles positive for MRSA
[**2184-10-20**] blood cultures: 2/4 bottles positive for MRSA
[**2184-10-20**] catheter tip: positive for MRSA
[**2184-10-20**] urine culture: GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIA. 10,000-100,000
Alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha streptococcus or
Lactobacillus sp.
Blood cultures 11/20, [**10-21**], [**10-22**], [**10-23**], [**10-25**]: no growth

Imaging:
CXR [**2184-10-19**]: 1. Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and
moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left.
2. Interval placement of left-sided hemodialysis catheter with
the tip within the right atrium.
3. Unchanged right-sided dual-chamber pacemaker.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2184-10-19**]:
1. No evidence of abcess or acute abdominal process.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left,
measuring simple
fluid attenuation. Trace pericardial effusion and small amount
of abdominal / pelvic ascites.
3. Possible sludge or stone in the gallbladder without evidence
of
cholelithiasis.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

Echo [**2184-10-25**]: Right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. LVEF>55%.
Increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion c/w
right ventricular pressure and volume overload. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. No vegetations seen.

Right foot plain films ([**10-25**]): No acute fracture. Soft tissue
swelling along the medial aspect of the foot centered at the
first MTP joint.

CXR ([**10-25**]): Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, right greater
than left, continues to increase.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Septic shock: Secondary to MRSA infection of HD catheter. The
catheter was removed and subsequent blood cultures were all
negative. TTE showed no vegetations. She initially required
levophed for hypotension and was treated with vancomycin and
cefepime, but the cefepime was stopped after cultures showed
MRSA in the blood. She had a temporary IJ HD line placed, which
was later changed to a permanent line. A PICC was also placed
for access and antibiotics. She was weaned off the levophed and
transferred out of the ICU, where she remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable, with SBP improved to 110s. Due to the
fluids received for resuscitation, she was significantly
hypervolemic, with pleural effusions and anasarca. She was
weaned off supplemental O2 and continued on HD, where some of
the excess fluid was removed. The vancomycin will continue at HD
for two weeks after the first negative blood culture, ie, until
[**11-4**]. Her PICC was removed at discharge.

2) Gout: Painful and swollen right 1st MTP noted and podiatry
was consulted. Steroids were avoided due to her recent septic
shock. She responded well to a 4 day course of indomethacin.

3) Macrocytic anemia: Initial hematocrit drop in setting of IV
fluid resuscitation. Patient was guaiac negative. She remained
stable in the mid to upper 20s, although this was below her
prior baseline. B12 and folate were normal. She was given epo at
HD, and later iron was added.

4) Afib with tachy-brady: Metoprolol was held throughout the
admission as the patient had no hypertension or tachycardia. Her
INR was initially supratherapeutic and vitamin K was given. It
later became subtherapeutic and her warfarin was restarted.

5) Post-herpetic neuralgia: Patient had intermittent pain under
L breast that responded well to capsaicin cream, tylenol and
warm compresses. As an outpatient, she can be evaluated for
long-term therapy, such as with gabapentin or venlafaxine.

6) Abdomi
