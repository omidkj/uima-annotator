CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and confusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 97956**] is a pleasant
77-year-old female who was recently diagnosed with nonsmall
cell lung cancer in [**2190-11-17**], and is status post four
treatments consisting of Taxol, carboplatin and XRT to the
right pretracheal mediastinal area, who presents to the
Emergency Department with fever and decreased blood pressure
along with some confusion.  The patient was recently
discharged on [**2190-12-16**] with the new diagnosis of her
nonsmall cell lung cancer and was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for
conditioning while receiving her chemotherapy.

The patient had been tolerating the treatments well until the
night before admission when she started complaining of
fatigue, and her O2 sat dropped to 93% on room air.  Later
on, the patient became very hypoxic with an oxygen saturation
of 87% on room air, and started experiencing lethargy along
with increased confusion.  The patient received percocet for
her pain, and her temperature spiked to 101.8, and O2 sats
continued to drop to 86% on 4 liters of nasal cannula.  The
patient also had decreased urine output, and her blood
pressure on arrival to the ED was 100/60, with a pulse of
110, and a respiratory rate of 30.  The patient also started
to experience some diaphoresis along with accessory muscle
use, and was sent to the ED of [**Hospital6 2018**].

On admission, the patient denied any headache, neck
stiffness, rash, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
abdominal pain, dysuria, frequency, urgency of her urine.
The patient was started on Zosyn and transferred to the
Kenard-ICU on the MUS ....... protocol for a working
diagnosis of septic shock secondary to pneumonia.

LABS AT ADMISSION:  White count 0.2, ANC 170, crit 33.2,

2.8, lactate 1.8.  Urinalysis was negative with no signs of
infection.  ABGs 7.43, PCO2 35, PO2 77 on 100% nonrebreather.

RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGES:  Chest x-ray showed a large spiculated
density in the right hilum, 7.0 x 5.2 cm, along with
adenopathy.  Pulmonary vasculature was slightly prominent
with Kerley B lines consistent with CHF.  Improved bilateral
pleural effusions as compared to prior x-rays.

EKG:  Showed 100 beats per minute, rate sinus rhythm, normal
axis, normal intervals, delayed R wave progression, and there
was some T wave inversions in V2-V4.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) SEPSIS/ID:  The patient presented to the
hospital with hypotension, fever, lethargy, and had a white
count of 0.2 most likely secondary to her most recent
chemotherapy.  Although initially there were no clear
presenting symptoms, or signs of patient infection, the
patient was started on broad coverage of Zosyn, Zithromax and
vancomycin.  Blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures
were sent, and throughout the hospital course the patient's
blood culture grew back [**5-21**] positive for Strep pneumoniae,
and so the patient was tailored accordingly to the
sensitivities, and was started on ceftriaxone 1 gm qd.  In
addition, the Zithromax and the Zosyn were stopped, since the
urine Legionella was negative.  The patient was also started
on stress dose steroids of hydrocortisone 100 mg IV tid which
the patient continued for 7 days.  Throughout the hospital
course, the patient's white blood count slowly began to rise
without requiring any Neupogen.  A surveillance set of blood
cultures was sent on [**1-12**], and another one on [**1-17**] which showed no further growth in the blood.  The patient
completed a 7-day course of IV ceftriaxone.

2) RESPIRATORY:  When the patient initially presented, the
patient did not appear to be in respiratory distress.
However, throughout the hospital course a CAT scan was
obtained that showed significant right middle lobe and right
lower lobe pneumonia, although the patient not producing much
sputum.  The patient was continued on the ceftriaxone, and on
[**1-16**] the patient was intubated secondary to
respiratory failure.  The patient began to retain carbon
dioxide and became confused and less responsive.  The patient
was extubated on [**2191-1-19**] in anticipation for comfort
measures only since the patient's condition continued to
deteriorate with a very poor prognosis.

3) CARDIOLOGY:  The patient has no known coronary artery
disease, and throughout the hospital course the patient was
in sinus rhythm with occasional PACs and ectopy.  The patient
was tachycardic which was thought to be a combination from
her being in sepsis, volume overload due to resuscitation,
respiratory distress.  In addition, after intubating, the
patient became very hypotensive and had decreased urine
output, and so required a significant amount of fluid
resuscitation along with Levophed to help maintain her blood
pressure.  Her Levophed was slowly weaned off a day or two
prior to her extubation, since she was able to maintain an
adequate amount of blood pressure.

4) HEME/ONC:  The patient completed chemotherapy consisting
of Taxol, carboplatin and XRT for nonsmall cell lung cancer.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who is her primary oncologist was involved
during the care of this patient in the ICU who recommended
that there was no need for Neupogen, as her white count would
slowly increase.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] also had an extensive
discussion with the family that despite her aggressive
treatment, her prognosis is very poor, and so at that time it
was decided that she would be extubated for goals of comfort
measures only.

5) LINES/ACCESS:  The patient will have a right subclavian
line to help get her medications to make her comfortable
consisting of morphine and ativan.

6) CODE:  The patient is DNR/DNI.

7) COMMUNICATION:  The [**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy is her
brother, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 97956**], and their family consisting of
Mr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname 97956**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Known lastname 97956**], and Ms. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 31250**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] were very involved in her care.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is being discharged to either
inpatient hospice versus home hospice with comfort measure
goals.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is comfortable at this
time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Morphine prn.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
