Admission Date:  [**2178-7-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2178-7-4**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a history of hypertension who presented from an
outside hospital with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction in
the inferior and posterior segments.

The patient had multiple episodes of nausea, chest pressure,
chest discomfort, and epigastric pain over the past two weeks
prior to admission.  Each episode lasted approximately one
hour.  The pain and episodes were stuttering in duration and
progression.  The pain radiated to her back and neck and was
associated with shortness of breath.  The patient also had
shortness of breath at rest.

She presented to an outside hospital where her
electrocardiogram showed first-degree atrioventricular block
with ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF; ST depressions
in leads I, aVL, V2 through V6.  She was placed on aspirin,
heparin, nitroglycerin, Lopressor, and Integrilin with near
resolution of anginal symptoms.

The patient was then transferred via helicopter to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for emergent catheterization.
An interventional heart catheterization was performed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13584**] which demonstrated a right-dominant coronary
circulation with left main coronary artery with a 30% tubular
ostial calcification, left anterior descending artery 70%
proximal lesion, [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30272**] diseased first diagonal, left
circumflex with 99% long stenosis involving the
origin/proximal portion of first obtuse marginal which filled
retrograde by left-to-left collaterals; likely very chronic
but contributory to anterolateral ST depressions noted on
electrocardiograms prior to transfer.  The right coronary
artery with initial TIMI-II flow, sequential 90% tubular then
90% ulcerated hazy lesions just before short posterior
descending artery (with 90% ostial) and large posterior left
ventricular branches.  Post Angio-Jet predilation 3 balloon,
Lopressor, and deployment of 3.5 X 33 Hepakote [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 30272**]
posterior descending artery jailed and lost, unable to engage
with base, right coronary artery 0% residual stenosis,
TIMI-III flow.

While transferring the patient to the stretcher status post
catheterization, the patient was given a tablet of Plavix and
became extraordinarily anxious upon attempting to swallow the
pill.  She then raised her heart rate to the 140s.  Her blood
pressure went to 240/130, and the patient went into flash
pulmonary edema.  She was given Lasix 40 mg intravenously
times two and a nitroglycerin 200-mcg bolus followed by a
nitroglycerin drip at 250 mcg/kg per minute.  She was also
Fentanyl 25 mcg for anxiety.  She also reported wheezing
after being given a beta blocker.  At that time, the
patient's blood pressure was at 189/101, and she was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
at the time of admission revealed heart rate was 122, blood
pressure was 189/101, respiratory rate was 20, and the
patient was saturating at 89% on 100% nonrebreather mask.  In
general, an elderly female producing pink frothy sputum,
mildly uncomfortable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the oropharynx was clear.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  On neck examination, unable to assess
jugular venous pulsation.  The lungs revealed rales all the
way bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, clicks, or
gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
dorsalis pedis, posterior tibialis, and radial  pulses were
2+ bilaterally.  No presacral or lower extremity edema.  The
right groin catheterization site was without hematoma or
bruits.  It was clean, dry, and intact.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Moved
all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed sodium was 140, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 119,
bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 15, creatinine
was 1, and blood glucose was 122.  Initial INR was 1.3.
Blood gas revealed 7.37/34/71.  Creatine kinase was [**2118**].

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram at the
outside hospital showed 1-mm to 2-mm ST elevations in leads
II, III, and aVF with 3-mm to 4-mm ST depressions in V1
through V6 (these were dynamic changes).

At [**Hospital1 69**], she had a normal
sinus rhythm with a prolonged P-R interval with normal axis.
Status post catheterization with a left axis deviation, still
with 0.5-mm ST elevations inferiorly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2178-7-2**], the patient was on
aspirin, Lipitor, morphine, heparin, Integrilin, and
nitroglycerin drip.

She was asymptomatic with no nausea, chest pain, chest
pressure, shortness of breath, palpitations, or edema.  Her
lung examination was markedly improved on her second hospital
day with crackles halfway up.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**7-2**] which showed an
ejection fraction of 50%.  No aortic stenosis.  Mitral
regurgitation of 2+ and 1+ tricuspid regurgitation.  No
effusions.  The left atrium was mildly dilated with inferior
wall motion abnormalities.

A chest x-ray from early on [**7-3**] showed likely congestive
heart failure with a tortuous aorta, small pleural effusions
(left greater than right), with pulmonary edema.

There was a discussion on [**7-2**] regarding taking the
patient back to the Catheterization Laboratory for treatment
of her left-sided disease.  However, it was decided that at
this time the culprit lesion was indeed the right coronary
artery, and the left-sided lesions would possibly be
corrected at a later date.

On [**7-3**], the patient was placed on metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o.
twice per day and given some as needed medications for her
gas/bloating.  She did have two brief hypotensive episodes to
a systolic blood pressure of 90 which quickly corrected with
250-cc boluses times two.  Her creatine kinases trended down
nicely from 3092 to 2199 to 1456.  Her MB fractions also
trended down from 401 to 221 to 110.

On [**2178-7-4**], the patient was changed from atorvastatin
to fluvastatin because of a recent study indicating a
mortality benefit from fluvastatin as opposed to atorvastatin
when combined with Plavix.

On [**7-4**], the patient was also started on lisinopril 5 mg
p.o. every day and changed to Toprol-XL 25 mg p.o. once per
day.  A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained which
showed the patient fully able to ambulate without becoming
symptomatic.  Her Foley catheter was discontinued.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in good
condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was informed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] (a
