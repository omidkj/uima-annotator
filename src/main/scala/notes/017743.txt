HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 53-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(not requiring home oxygen), coronary artery disease, and
diabetes admitted directly to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
on [**9-20**] for hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory
failure.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was in his usual state of health until the
morning of [**9-20**] when he developed progressive shortness
of breath not relieved by his usual inhalers.  Prior to the
onset of this dyspnea, he relates experiencing a runny nose
and a sore throat for several days.  However, he denies
experiencing chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
fevers, chills, or a productive cough.

After several hours of worsening shortness of breath,
tachypnea and diaphoresis, the patient called Emergency
Medical Service and was taken to [**Hospital1 190**] for evaluation and treatment.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be in
severe respiratory distress; only able to speak 1-word
sentences.   His vital signs were as follows; temperature was
97.9, blood pressure was 239/159, heart rate was 124,
respiratory rate was 36, and oxygen saturation of 83% on 100%
nonrebreather.  The patient was then intubated, placed on a
nitroglycerin drip for blood pressure, started on steroids,
antibiotics, and nebulizers and admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was placed on
ventilator assist-control mode.  He was intubated for less
than 24 hours.  On the morning following his admission to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was weaned off the
ventilator.  His nitroglycerin drip was stopped.  His oxygen
saturations were found to be greater than 95% on 5 liters
nasal cannula, and his blood pressure was well controlled
with a systolic blood pressure of 160.

The patient was then called out to the floor for further
observation.  During the Intensive Care Unit stay, the
patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with cycled
enzymes and electrocardiogram.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; 3-vessel disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2168**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes mellitus; complicated by nephropathy.
4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; not requiring home
oxygen, unknown pulmonary function tests.  Multiple
admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbations including one in [**2172**] which required
intubation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Home medications were albuterol,
aspirin, Flovent, NPH insulin, Atrovent, levofloxacin,
Ativan, Protonix.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a long-time smoker with
greater than a 40-pack-year history; smoking half a pack per
day.  He admits to occasional alcohol use; four beers on the
weekends, but denies any intravenous drug use.  He lives
alone in [**Location 8391**] and has a girlfriend.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Vital signs on the
floor were as follows; temperature was 98.1, blood pressure
was 150/80, heart rate was 86, respiratory rate was 22,
saturating 98% on 5 liters nasal cannula.  The patient's
physical examination in general revealed the patient was a
well-developed and well-nourished male, in bed, appeared
comfortable, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light. Sclerae were anicteric.  His oropharynx was clear with
poor dentition and dry mucous membranes.  Neck revealed the
patient had no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy,
and his neck was supple.  Cardiovascular revealed the
patient's heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  A soft 2/6
systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.  No rubs or
gallops.  Lungs revealed the patient had decreased breath
sounds at the bases, diffuse rhonchi most prominently
anteriorly in the right lung, and expiratory wheezes in the
right lung.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with good bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed
the patient's extremities were notable for clubbing, tar
stains, and cyanosis; but no edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed complete blood count was as follows; white blood
cell count was 11.1, hematocrit was 40.4, and platelet count
was 234.  His Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 140, potassium
was 4.1, chloride was 104, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea
nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 0.8, blood glucose was 190.
Calcium was 8.9, magnesium was 1.5, and phosphorous was 4.4.
His last arterial blood gas in the Unit prior to transfer to
the floor was on 4 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula with a
pH of 7.4, PCO2 was 48, and an O2 of 84.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray from [**9-20**] (on the date
of admission) showed cardiomegaly, but no overt congestive
heart failure.  No consolidations or effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  PULMONARY:  As previously mentioned, the patient was
intubated in the Emergency Department, started on Solu-Medrol
and levofloxacin, and rapidly weaned off the ventilator to
room air on which he was saturating 95% to 98% on discharge.

The patient was also treated with albuterol, Atrovent, and
Flovent during his stay in the Intensive Care Unit.  Sputum
culture were sent but were pending at the time of discharge.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was markedly hypertensive on
presentation to the Emergency Department.  He was started on
a nitroglycerin drip with resolution of the hypertension.
The patient was then switched to his regular doses of
captopril and Lopressor with eventual blood pressures of 160
to 150/80 on discharge.

3.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient was kept on a regular insulin
sliding-scale during his stay, and blood sugars were
generally between 150 and 300.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
