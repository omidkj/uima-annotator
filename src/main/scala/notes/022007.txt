saturation of 100%, paralyzed, on the ventilator, setting at
AC 700 X 12, FIO2 of 100%, and a positive end-expiratory
pressure of 5.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
findings on admission revealed a white blood cell count
of 13.8 (with a differential of 81 neutrophils,
13 lymphocytes, 4 monocytes, 0.5 eosinophils, 0.7 basophils),
hematocrit of 38.5, platelet count of 483.  Chem-7 revealed
sodium of 135,  potassium of 3.5, chloride of 98, bicarbonate
of 22, blood urea nitrogen of 17, creatinine of 0.9, blood
sugar of 158.  Creatine kinase was 120, with a MB of 3.
Urinalysis showed yellow/clear urine, with a specific gravity
of 1.02, 30 protein, 15 ketones, pH of 9, 325 white blood
cells, occasional bacteria, 3 to 5 epithelial cells.  Urine
culture was pending.  Serum drug screen was positive for
benzodiazepines.  Urine drug screen was positive for
benzodiazepines and cocaine.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed tachycardic,
sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals.  There was right
atrial enlargement and poor R wave progression.  There were
no changes when compared with prior.

Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia, ETT tube at 2.9 cm above
groin with nasogastric tube well positioned in stomach.

Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage. There was slight
thickening of the sinuses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further management after intubation
in the Emergency Department.

1.  AIRWAYS:  The patient's sedation as well as paralysis was
allowed to wear off with plan for extubation.  However, the
patient was extubated within one hour of arriving to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was able to maintain her
airway, oxygenate, and ventilate well; and the decision was
made not to reintubate.

2.  OVERDOSE:  It was unclear which medications the patient
ingested.  Once extubated, with the help of a Spanish
interpreter, the patient was interviewed and insisted that
she wanted to take some medication just to sleep.  Her
electrocardiogram was followed for QT prolongation in case
one of the medications she ingested was a tricyclic
antidepressant.  She was placed on a CIWA scale in case part
of her agitation was due to alcohol withdrawal.  The Ativan
was stopped once further information became available, and
the patient was confirmed not to have significant alcohol
history.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Upon presentation the patient was
tachycardic and hypertensive with a blood pressure of up to
230/140.  She initially received hydralazine with improvement
in her blood pressure to 170/90.  Intravenous hydralazine was
continued during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.  Due
to positive cocaine screen, Lopressor and labetalol were
avoided.  The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction
with serial troponins, since she received intramuscular
injections.  Due to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
allergy, aspirin was held.

4.  AGITATION:  Following self-extubation, the patient became
increasingly more agitated and combative.  Per Spanish
interpreter, the patient was aware of herself, her location,
and time, and date.  She was noted to induce emesis by
placing her fingers in her mouth.

Due to the progressive increase in agitation and
[**Last Name (LF) 29399**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] emergent Psychiatry evaluation was
obtained.  The patient was judged to be a danger to self as
well as others, and restraints were indicated.  Neither soft
nor leather restraints were able to restrain the patient, and
chemical restraint was recommended by Psychiatry.  The
patient received a cocktail of Haldol, Ativan and Cogentin
leading to a decrease in her agitation.  The next day, the
patient woke up much more cooperative and not agitated.

5.  PROPHYLAXIS:  For prophylaxis, the patient was maintained
on subcutaneous heparin and Prevacid through the nasogastric
tube.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to [**Hospital6 18075**] for psychiatric hospitalization.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: (Her medications on discharge
included)
1.  Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
