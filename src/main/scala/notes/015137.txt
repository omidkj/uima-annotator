Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Hand Clumsiness and Dysarthria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
64 y.o. RH man with PMH remarkable for hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, DM 2 with recently diagnosed CAD and s/p drug
eluting stents 72h ago (to RCA and LAD: 70% stenosis) p/w new
onset chest heaviness and slurred speech starting abruptly at
20:06.

He was able to understand his relatives and produce speech.
However, his son and the pt feel he sounded "tired" or "drunk".
There were no mistakes when using words or word finding
difficulty.

He also refers a mild sensation of numbness (lidocaine
sensation)
initially in his first three fingers in the LEFT hand that
progressed toward all his fingers in the palmar and dorsal
aspect
of the hand (cannot explain how long it took for it to spread).
In addition, he cannot recall for how long it had been present
(now resolved per pt).

He had no nausea or vomiting. No visual deficits, weakness or
heaviness of his arms or legs. No dizziness or disequilibrium or
any other symptoms.

He has been compliant with his ASA and plavix since his cardiac
cath. He has not experienced this slurred speech before. He has
no hx of seizure disorder. He had no headache at the time this
episode happened.

IMAGING
.
CTA Head and Neck ([**2141-10-4**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. While full evaluation of the lumen of the right internal
carotid artery is limited given the extensive calcification,
there does appear to be a short segment of high- grade stenosis
at the origin.
2. Moderate grade stenosis at the origin of the left vertebral
artery.
3. Additional multifocal atherosclerotic disease as detailed,
including
moderate stenosis of the distal right vertebral artery.
4. Focal lucencies within the centrum semiovale and corona
radiata on the
right. These likely represent subacute infarcts and could be
further
evaluated with MRI. These may be downstream effects of the
high-grade stenosis at the origin of the right internal carotid
artery. Further evaluation of the right internal carotid artery
could be attempted with ultrasound, though the calcification
will likely limit this examination, at which point a contrast-
enhanced MRA could be performed.
5. Extensive degenerative and post-surgical changes within the
cervical spine with ossification of the posterior longitudinal
ligament from C3 through C5 which appears to create at least a
moderate degree of canal narrowing and could be further
evaluated with dedicated cervical spine MRI as indicated.
.
Carotid Duplex ([**2141-10-4**]):
Impression:
Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
.
CTA Head, Neck ([**2141-10-6**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Expected post-surgical changes following interval right
carotid
endarterectomy, with a now patulous right carotid bulb and
proximal internal carotid artery.
2. Origin of the right common carotid artery is not
well-evaluated, but
appears poorly-opacified, new since the recent CTA; interval
thrombosis/occlusion of this vessel cannot be excluded.
3. Stable moderate atherosclerotic disease and stenosis of the
distal right vertebral artery.
.
CT Head without Contrast ([**2141-10-8**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval progression in the hypodense region involving the
right centrum semiovale and corona radiata, now spanning
approximately 5 cm (AP). This could represent evolution of
previously identified infarct, or could reflect new infarct. MRI
is more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia.
2. No hemorrhage, significant mass effect or shift of midline
structures.
.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The process, described above,
represents
further progression of relatively acute infarct involving the
right corona
radiata, with subtle mass effect on the lateral margin of the
lateral
ventricular body and minimal leftward deviation of the anterior
portion of
the septum pellucidum.
.
CT Perfusion ([**2141-10-9**]):
IMPRESSION: Diminished cerebral perfusion is present throughout
the majority of the right cerebral hemisphere with patchy areas
of diminished blood volume, compatible with infarcts as seen on
the preceding CT scan.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ([**2141-10-4**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial
