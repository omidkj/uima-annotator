Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
female, with past medical history significant for
schizophrenia, a recent T12 burst fracture complicated by
bilateral lower extremity paresis, diabetes mellitus and
COPD, who presented from her rehab with fever, change in
mental status and hypotension. In rehab, there was concern
for pneumonia, so she was given empiric Flagyl and
levofloxacin. In the emergency department, temperature was
104, heart rate 130, BP 168/63, respiratory rate 36-42, 100%
on nonrebreather, unable to answer questions. She
subsequently developed respiratory distress and was
intubated. Her orogastric tube put out small amounts of
reddish fluid. Her stool was guaiac positive. She developed
supraventricular tachycardia at a rate of approximately 150,
subsequently read out as sinus tachycardia, and she was
admitted to the ICU.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable to be obtained at the time of
admission.

ALLERGIES:  Include Risperdal and an ACE inhibitor for which

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Dementia, schizophrenia, history of GI
bleed for which she declined work-up, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, COPD, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
osteoarthritis, neuropathy, urinary incontinence, recent T12
burst fracture complicated by bilateral lower extremity
paresis, status post T12 vertebrectomy and T11-L1 fusion by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**]. Her OR course at that time was complicated by a
lung collapse requiring a chest tube placement, spinal,
status post PEG placement in [**2107-7-9**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Has siblings with schizophrenia, otherwise
noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Longstanding mental illness, presently
living in nursing home.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  She was intubated, sedated.
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. Oropharynx could
not be assessed. Neck: Right IJ in place with dressing.
Chest: A few crackles at base, decreased breath sounds, no
wheezes. Cardiac: Normal S1, S2, II/VI systolic ejection
murmur heard across the chest. Abdomen soft, nontender. PEG
tube without erythema or draining. Extremities warm, no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ DPs bilaterally. Neuro:
Unable to assess. Skin: No rash.

PERTINENT LABS TIME OF ADMISSION:  White count 12.9,
hematocrit 28.8, platelets 447, 84% neutrophils, 10%
lymphocytes, INR 1.2. Chem-7 was notable for hypernatremia,
sodium 150, mild hyperglycemia--161, and a BUN and creatinine
of 51 and 0.8. There were low-grade troponin elevations of
0.17 and 0.18, but there was no significant change throughout
the hospitalization. Iron studies revealed a ferritin of 160,
an iron of 58, TIBC of 191, TSH was 1.8. Initial lactate was
2.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU,
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intubated for
respiratory failure. There was initial concern that she might
have a source of infection in her low back from recent
instrumentation. Full imaging with MRI was precluded by the
placement of hardware; however, she did have a CT and an
evaluation by orthopedics who now feel that this was the
source. Despite broad cultures, no specific organism was
identified; however, during the hospital stay she was noted
to have a left lower lobe consolidation which may be the
primary etiology of her sepsis syndrome. She was successfully
extubated and transferred to the medical floor where she
continued on vancomycin and ceftazidime. Remainder of course
by problems.

1.  SCHIZOPHRENIA: Patient was restarted on olanzapine and
    Cogentin and remained stable through her hospitalization.

1.  SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Patient had intermittent bursts of a
    sinus tachycardia at a rate of approximately 140-150;
    however, despite the cardiology read this could be an
    atrial tachycardia, although flutter seemed unlikely. In
    order to treat this, her beta blockers were titrated up
    with good effect.

1.  DIABETES MELLITUS: She was continued on sliding scale
    insulin with good glucose control.

1.  She was noted to have several small bullous lesions on
    her lower extremities which remained stable.

RELEVANT IMAGING STUDIES:

CT of the chest,INDICATION:  Fever, altered mental status.
Recent spine surgery.  Evaluate for abdominal source of
infection.

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic inlet to
the pubic symphysis were acquired with the use of intravenous and
oral contrast material and displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.

COMPARISONS:  No prior studies are available on PACS for
comparison.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is bilateral
lower lobe atelectasis, left larger than right and small left
pleural effusion.  No consolidations are seen.  The heart appears
normal and there is no pericardial effusion.  There are coronary
artery calcifications and calcifications of the
aortic arch and left subclavian origin.  There are stable
mediastinal lymph nodes, [**Location (un) **] of which meet size criteria for
pathologic enlargement. No hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is
seen.  There are pedicle screws\t the level of
L2.  There are fusion rods extending up to the level of T6.  A
metallic cage is seen in the space that appears to be resected
T12 vertebral body.  There are transverse fixations screws in the
vertebral bodies of L1 and T11.  No paravertebral fluid
collection is seen to suggest the presence of an abscess.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The gallbladder
contains several gallstones but no signs of cholecystitis are
seen.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, stomach and small and large
bowel loops appear unremarkable.  A G- tube is seen in
appropriate position.  No free air is seen.  There is no
ascites.  No localized fluid collections are seen to suggest the
presence of an abscess.  The kidneys contain multiple
hypoattenuating lesions, sub-centimeter in size, too small to
characterize. The right adrenal gland appears normal, the left
adrenal gland contains a 19 x 16 mm nodule which may represent an
adenoma but cannot be fully characterized on this single phase
study.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS AND ORAL CONTRAST:  There is
sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.  The
rectum appears unremarkable.  The bladder contains a Foley
catheter and appears unremarkable. The uterus is not well seen,
and may be atrophic or surgically absent.  No
free fluid is seen in the pelvis.  No abscess is seen.  No pelvic
lymphadenopathy is seen.

BONE WINDOWS:  Extensive post-surgical changes as described in
the chest section.  There is a bony defect in the right iliac
[**Doctor First Name 362**] consistent with a bone graft harvest site.  No suspicious
lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Status post extensive spine surgery without evidence of
paraspinal abscess.
2.  Bilateral dependent atelectasis and small left pleural
effusion.
3.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
4.  Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, too small
to characterize.  Statistically, these most likely represent
cysts.
5.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
6.  Possible left adrenal adenoma. A dedicated CT may be
performed for further evaluation if clinically inicated.


ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ao
