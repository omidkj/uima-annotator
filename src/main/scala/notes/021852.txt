Chief Complaint:
Anoxic brain injury

History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 yo female with a past medical history of severe
asthma, DM2 and hypertension is transferred from [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital after suffering a PEA arrest in the setting of an
adenosine stress test with subsequent anoxic brain injury.
Briefly, the patient presented to the OSH with chest pain and
was admitted for rule out MI. She was to undergo an adenosine
stress test on [**2149-5-7**], but once the adenosine was infused, the
patient had acute bronchospasm, and while being ambu-bagged, she
went into PEA arrest. She was intubated, given aminophylline,
atropine, epinephrine and bicarb. She regained a pulse after 7
minutes of CPR and was transferred first to the ED and then to
the ICU.
In the OSH ICU, she developed myoclonus, which at first was felt
to be seizure activity. She was loaded on dilantin and started
on propofol. Neurology was consulted and felt the myoclonus was
representative of anoxic brain injury. She underwent an EEG
which was nonspecific. The plan was to obtain an MRI, but the
patient would need to be bagged by hand, and at that point the
patient was requested for transfer to [**Location (un) 86**] by her family for a
second opinion. Of note, request was made to both [**Hospital1 2025**] and [**Hospital1 112**]
neuro ICU and MICU and both institutions declined transfer.
Her course was otherwise complicated by an e coli UTI, for which
she received and is transferred on ciprofloxacin, and [**1-18**]
bottles from the left IJ positive for coag negative staph. The
IJ was pulled and the catheter tip is NGTD.

Relevant Imaging:
1)MRI ([**5-15**]): 1. Increased T2 and FLAIR signal within the
bilateral basal ganglia and caudate nucleus, without
corresponding diffusion-weighted abnormality may relate to
hypoxic insult.
2. Restricted diffusion in bilateral occipital regions and
bilateral centrum semiovale without corresponding FLAIR
abnormality may also relate to hypoxic injury that may be
accounted for by diffusely narrowed posterior circulation which
may place patient at increased risk for hypoxia in the territory
of the posterior circulation. Continued followup is recommended
and possible CT or MR perfusion study may be performed in the
future to further assess regional blood flow.
3. Diffuse slight increased FLAIR signal throughout the cerebral
cortex is of uncertain clinical significance, although cortical
hypoperfusion cannot be excluded, despite the absence of
diffusion abnormality in these regions.

2)EEG ([**5-15**]): Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the very low
voltage
slow background throughout and due to the right anterior
quadrant
epileptiform discharges. The first abnormality signifies a
severe
encephalopathy. Especially with the very low voltage background,
anoxia
is a relatively common cause. The muscle activity associated
with arm
movements appeared by video to represent posturing and not a
seizure.
There were also isolated epileptiform discharges in the right
anterior
quadrant, but there were no sustained or repetitive discharges
or
electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo female with anoxic brain injury after
PEA arrest in the setting of bronchospasm to adenosine.
.
1)Anoxic Brain Injury: Neurology team from OSH felt that
myoclonus was indicative of anoxic brain injury. Patient is
currently with decorticate posturing on exam, but no clonus.
Very rigid. Neurology was consulted after she was transferred
here and felt that her prognosis was poor and would likely
remain in a comatose state. MRI and EEG were done as part of the
work-up. The patient was initially extubated but had difficulty
maintaining adequate oxygen saturations and she also had a
significant amount of secretions. After discussion with the
family the decision was made to go ahead with trach and PEG.
Family was in agreement with this plan.
.
2)Respiratory Failure: Patient was transferred from OSH
intubated. She was extubated but did not tolerate this well. The
decision was made to go ahead with trach and PEG after
discussion with the family.
.
3)Fevers: Patient was treated with Cipro x 3 days for a urinary
tract infection. She continued to have low-grade temps to 100.1
without leukocytosis and with no localizing source. Sputum was
felt to be growing oral flora and subsequent urine cultures grew
yeast and foley was thus changed. No additional treatment was
offered.
.
4)Type 2 DM: She was initially placed on an insulin gtt for
glycemic control but has been transitioned to insulin sliding
scale with close monitoring of her blood sugars.
.
5)Hypertension: She was continued on Metoprolol.
.
6)FEN: Tube feeds
.
