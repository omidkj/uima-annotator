Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICU treatment

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 71 yo Spanish-speaking male with a
complicated PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG in [**2140**], ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 17%) cath in [**1-/2145**] without intervention
(results of cath currently unknown), but with resultant diffuse
atheroembolic disease leading to renal failure, transaminitis,
pancreatitis, and skin phenomena. He required HD during that
hospital stay, but then became bacteremic with a form of
streptococcus, requiring pulling of the tunneled HD line and
treatment with ceftriaxone. He also had multiple bouts of
tachycardia (not otherwise specified) during that
hospitalization, requiring a brief stay in the CCU. He was
discharged from [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2145-3-16**] after his month-long
hospitalization and went to [**Hospital3 537**] for rehab. At [**Hospital **], he was apparently doing well until the night of
presentation when he developed the acute onset of SOB. [**Name6 (MD) **] his
RN's report, he developed SOB with O2 sats in the 80s on 2L
nasal cannula, which is much lower than what he usually is. It
was unknown whether or not he was tachycardic at the time. He
was also reportedly diaphoretic, but denied any chest pain or
pressure. The [**Hospital1 1501**] reports that at baseline, he has a waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, but has not had any difficulties with SOB
or CP since his discharge. They have been giving him his IV
lasix regularly and he has been making good urine output. They
did not have a foley catheter in place at [**Hospital3 537**] and was
voiding on his own without difficulty. He does not walk, stays
in bed most of the day, but is able to get up to a chair. He was
taken by ambulance from [**Hospital3 537**] to our ED.
.
In the ED, he was felt to be fluid overloaded. However he had a
WBC of 13.4 with a left shift and a lactate of 3.4, raising
concern for infection/sepsis. His lasix was held and he was
given vancomycin and levofloxacin, as well as ASA 325mg. CTA was
not performed given his renal failure. His CXR was consistent
with CHF,  however, and given his multiple cardiac issues, he
was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for further management.
.
On arrival to the floor, he reported feeling improved. He mainly
complained of pain all over his body. He felt that his breathing
was back to baseline. He denied any associated chest discomfort.
He was  interviewed with his sister at his bedside, and she felt
his MS was at his baseline.
.
This AM, he developed an SVT, likely an AVNRT, at a rate of 120.
He felt SOB and had chest tightness, along with "all over" body
pain. He was given 5mg IV lopressor w/o any improvement in HR.
He was given O2 and felt relief in terms of his dyspnea. He
refused breakfast but was given his PO medications. He then
began to dry heave and throw up his pills. An interpreter was
called to try to further identify his complaints. He denied any
recent fevers or chills, cough, cold symptoms, chest pain or
pressure, or SOB. He can't remember the events of yesterday and
complains only of fatigue, total body aches, nausea, and
constipation. He feels that his breathing is improved currently
but is frustrated at his lengthy medical illness and is
concerned that no one is helping and that he is going to die. He
denies any drug allergies (though is listed as being allergic to
percocet and lisinopril). He states that he previously was
functional and independent, before everything happened in
[**Month (only) 404**] after his cath. He fears he will never return to his
baseline level of functioning.
