Admission Date:  [**2177-3-29**]     Discharge Date:  [**2177-4-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2104-1-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MEDICINE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year old African
American male diagnosed with congestive heart failure in
[**11-9**], who presents with sudden fatigue, weakness and dyspnea
while bringing out his trash.  The patient felt well until
the morning of admission and was brought to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department by ambulance.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was asymptomatic and
denied previous oxygen requirement or lower extremity edema.
He has been compliant with his congestive heart failure
medication including low sodium diet and daily weights.  He
states that he is without symptoms at this time.  In the
Emergency Department, he was noted to have atrial flutter
with heart rate 120 to 130 with mild hypotension.  Due to his
abrupt symptoms, the patient underwent VQ scan which
indicated low probability for pulmonary embolus.

Review of systems was negative for fever, chills, upper
respiratory infection symptoms, chest pain, positive for
shortness of breath, negative for nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis or abdominal pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure diagnosed in [**11-9**].
Catheterization at that time was negative except for apical
and septal akinesis, ejection fraction noted to be 12%.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus which is diet
controlled.
4.  Prostate cancer, status post prostatectomy.
5.  ? multiple myeloma.
6.  Hernia, status post herniorrhaphy.
7.  Keloid scars.
8.  Status post bilateral total knee replacement.
9.  Carpal tunnel syndrome.
10. Prolapsed rectum.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Univasc 15 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of alcohol use.
He also has a history of tobacco use approximately one pack
per day for thirty-five to forty years, but quit twenty years
ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of myocardial infarction at age
80.  Brother died of diabetes mellitus in his 30s and sister
died of diabetes mellitus/systemic lupus erythematosus in her
50s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed temperature of
96.5, blood pressure 122/70, pulse 113, respiratory rate 20,
oxygen saturation 97% on three liters, weight 74.5 kilograms.
In general, this is a moderately obese African American male
lying in bed in no acute distress.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Anicteric sclera.  Mucous membranes are moist.  No
lymphadenopathy. No jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular - the heart rate was fast but regular, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen revealed normoactive
bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended, no masses.
Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema, no swelling,
good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count was 10.1,
hematocrit 38, platelets 276,000.  Prothrombin time 14.2,
partial thromboplastin time 28.0, INR 1.4.  Chem7 showed a
sodium of 140, potassium 4.7, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25,
blood urea nitrogen 46, creatinine 1.9, blood sugar 175,
calcium 9.5.

Electrocardiogram showed normal axis, wide QRS with possible
Q waves in V1 through V3 with poor R wave progression.  There
is right bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - atrial flutter - The patient was started
on Heparin in the Emergency Department and underwent
transesophageal echocardiogram on [**2177-3-31**], which showed the
following: dilated left atrium with no spontaneous
echocardiographic contrast seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage with markedly reduced left
atrial appendage emptying.  There were two mobile echogenic
masses seen in the left atrial appendage on multiple views
consistent with probable thrombus. There was also severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis with right ventricular
systolic function appearing depressed.  There are small
echogenic masses on the ventricular surface of the aortic
valve.  Mitral regurgitation 1+ was seen.

At that time, direct cardioversion was held secondary to the
possibility of emboli/clot.  That night, the patient was
noted to have hypotension to the 70s to 80s which was
moderately responsive to intravenous fluids.  It was thought
secondary to poor atrial kick and decompensation of the
heart.

The following morning the patient underwent atrial flutter
ablation with mild improvement of systolic blood pressure to
90s.  The patient continued to have poor response to
intravenous fluids with poor urine output.  Creatinine was
noted to be increased from 2.1 on [**2177-4-1**], to 2.5 on
[**2177-4-2**].

At that time, he was transferred to the CCU for intravenous
Dopamine for improvement of pressure and diuresed with Lasix
drip.

Right IJ and right arterial line were introduced at that
time.  Pulmonary artery catheter was introduced as well
noting introductory pressures of the following:  right atrial
pressure 16 with pulmonary artery pressure of 47/32 with a
wedge of 32, cardiac index 2.21 and SVR 1200.  He was started
on Dopamine with approximate 6.3 liters diuresis after Lasix
drip.  Wedge decreased to 22 to 23 with cardiac output
increased to 6.0 and cardiac index improved to 2.5.

The patient was gradually weaned off Lasix drip and placed on
p.o. Lasix b.i.d.  Dopamine was weaned off on [**2177-4-3**].  On
[**2177-4-4**], the patient was transferred back to the floor for
further management.

That night, Carvedilol was restarted with good effect.

2.  Renal - The patient was noted to have times of prerenal,
acute renal failure on [**2177-3-31**], at admission with blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine both increased.  He was given mild
intravenous fluids with worsening of creatinine the following
day.  On [**2177-4-2**], creatinine was noted to be 2.5 with
potassium 5.4.  He was given Kayexalate to improve his
hyperkalemia.  Urine electrolytes noted prerenal defect with
FENA of 0.21%.  At that time, he was transferred to the CCU
for Lasix drip and severe diuresis.  Blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine were noted to be improved.  Creatinine on
[**2177-4-4**], was noted to be 1.4 which is almost back to
baseline.

3.  Hematology - The patient was noted to have hematocrit of
38.0 on admission which has decreased after every procedure.
Hematocrit on [**2177-4-4**], was noted to be 28.5.  Analysis and
iron study laboratories were sent off.  Heparin and Coumadin
were continued for left atrial thrombus and to prevent
embolization.

DISPOSITION:   The patient will likely be discharged home on
[**2177-4-5**].  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately
two to three weeks in Advanced [**Hospital **] Clinic.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d.
2.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d. times three months and then
    switch to 200 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Coreg 3.125 mg b.i.d.
5.  Enalapril 2.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  New atrial flutter, status post ablation.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5.  Prostate cancer.
6.  Herniorrhaphy.
