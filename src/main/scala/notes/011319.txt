77yo Spanish speaking male w/ COPD, CAD, CRI, Type II DM and s/p
dx lg bilateral PE [**12-23**] transferred to the ICU [**2-1**] for
tachypnea and hypoxia. Initially admitted [**2108-1-28**] from rehab when

showed no filling defects. Pt was treated for COPD exacerbation
w/ steroids, azithroCTX, nebs. He was also diuresed given

A/P: 77 year spanish speaking man with DM2, HTN, COPD, prostate
Ca, CRI, CAD who comes in w/sob, cough and hypoxia in the
context of recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] for large bil PEs.
-
Hypoxia- Likely multifactorial due to PE, superimposed PNA, and
COPD. Pt. had brief MICU stay for hypoxia but was just put on
non invasive ventilation overnight and his oxygen saturation
improved with better HR control, consistent with diastolic
dysfunction. He also spiked a fever and was found to have an
infiltrate on CXR, for which he was treated with vancomycin,
ceftriaxone for 7 days, and will go home on 7 days levofloxacin.
