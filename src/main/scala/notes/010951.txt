Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography - [**2189-11-4**]


History of Present Illness:
87 y/o M with PMHx of CAD, [**Month/Day/Year 19874**] (EF=40-45%), HTN, HL, COPD
presented to OSH on [**11-3**] after feeling faint and pressing his
LifeLine button.  Per OSH records, he has been more tired for
several days, had transient chest pain, RUQ pain prior to
syncoplal episode on morning of presentation.  Initially on
presentation, was somnolent, SBP in the 80s, responded to
fluids, fever to 100.1.  Initial labs showing AST 400, ALT 300,
TB 1.0. Repeat labs AST 550, ALT 5000, ALP 230, lipase 1800,
amylase 1300).  RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis with wall
thickening, but no wall edema and no CBD dilitation, negative
[**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  CXR with small pleural effusion.  U/A normal.
Surgery consulted on the patient and he was not a surgical
candidate.  Started on Unasyn.  GI consulted and thought patient
requires ERCP for concern of cholangitis. Of note his blood
pressures were persistently low, he required 2 250 cc boluses at
least to keep his SBPs < 90 in addition to maintenance fluids.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood culture x 2 ([**2189-11-4**])- no growth to date, pending final
Urine culture ([**2189-11-4**])- no growth
.
(OSH)
CXR: [**2189-11-3**] Small right sided pleural effusion versus
pleural thickening. Probable left sided atelectasis/scarring
.
RUQ ultrasound: [**2189-11-3**]: Evaluation is limited due to
patients body habitus. The liver is heterogenoeous in
echotexture with no focal lesions identified.  There is no
evidence of intra-or extrahepatic ductal dilation.  The common
hepatic duct measures 2mm and within normal limits. The
gallbladder is visualized and appears to contain a 1 cm stone.
There is mild gallbladder wall mildly thickened to 5mm however
no evidence of gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid.  A
negative [**Doctor Last Name **] sign was elicited.  There is no free fluiid.
The pancreas is not visualized due to overlying bowel gas.  The
right kidney is unremarkable.
.
[**Hospital1 18**]
CXR [**2189-11-4**]:
There is mild cardiomegaly. There are low lung volumes.
Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is associated with
adjacent opacities, likely atelectases. Ill-defined rounded
nodular opacities in the left upper lobe have a broad
differential diagnosis as etiology including infectious process.

The pulmonary arteries are enlarged. Ill-defined faint opacity
in the left lower lobe obscures partially the lung vessels.
.
CT is recommended for further evaluation of the chest to exclude
pulmonary embolism, pulmonary artery hypertension, and further
assessment of probable infectious process in the left lung.
.
ERCP Report ([**2189-11-4**]):
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was initially
unsuccessful. Thus, a careful pre-cut sphincterotomy was
performed to gain access. Cannulation was subsequently
successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a guidewire was
placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
.
Biliary Tree Fluoroscopic Interpretation: A mild diffuse
dilation was seen at the biliary tree with the CBD measuring 9
mm. There were no filling defects seen. An occlusion
cholangiogram was not done given concern for cholangitis. Given
cholangitis and gallstone pancreatitis, decision was made to
extend the pre-cut sphincterotomy.  An extension sphincterotomy
was performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome
over an existing guidewire. Balloon sweep x 2 was performed with
successful extraction of sludge.
Pancreas Fluoroscopic Interpretation: A limited pancreatogram
was normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o M with PMHx of CAD, [**Month/Day/Year 19874**] (EF=40-45%), HTN, HL, COPD
presented to OSH on [**11-3**] with RUQ, fever, and rapidly
developing transaminitis and pancreatic enzymes, transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP with concern for cholangitis.
.
# Gallstone pancreatitis - Bisap score= 4 on admission. RUQ
ultrasound at OSH showed evidence of gallstone with common bile
duct dilation.  Amylase and lipase were grossly elevated,
consistent with pancreatitis.  ERCP performed on HD1 with
sphincterotomy performed (see attached report). Amylase/lipase
were downtrending following ERCP.  Patient was pain free
following procedure and vital signs were stable.  On HD2 patient
was started on clear liquid diet and advanced to a regular diet
which he tolerated without issue.
.
# Suspected cholangitis - Evidence of biliary dilation on ERCP
and with known gallstone, concern for cholangitis.  Patient
started on cipro/Flagy
