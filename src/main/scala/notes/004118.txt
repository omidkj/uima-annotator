Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M w/ho gallstones presenting to the emergency department from
an [**Hospital1 1562**] for likely cholangitis. Patient reports having right
upper quadrant and epigastric abdominal pain for the last 24-36
hours. At the outside hospital his initial VS were 96.8, 116/65,
65 16, 100RA, and he spiked a temp to 102.2 and he had an
episode of NBNB emesis. His labs were notable for evated T. bili
to 1.6 as well as elevated alkaline phosphatase. He was given 3g
IV Unasyn, morphine, zofran and MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 90357**] for likely
cholangitis transferred. The patient has had ERCP with
sphincterotomy approximately a year ago. Right upper quadrant
ultrasound did demonstrate sludging and stones but no evidence
of CBD dilatation or cholecystitis. Also received tylenol at the
OSH for his fever.  Was initially stable here initial VS were:
99.5 65 130/53 18 98% ra.  Had increased O2 requirement and
became hypotensive sbp 70s, got 1L at OSH, 1.5L here. Had RIJ
put in 92/33, Vpaced. RR 20 99%2L. Started on norepi in ED, also
vanc here.  ERCP fellow contact[**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) **] do it in the morning.
FFP will need to be given.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were BP 77/53 (not on
pressors), HR 65 Vpaced, 20 97% 2L.  He was mentating well with
complaints of a slightly upset stomach and feeling like his
speech was slurred from the pain medicaitons. He denied any
abdominal pain currently, chest pain, shortness of breath,
dizziness or lightheadedness. He reports recently trying a low
fat diet. Pt reports the pain comes on when he eats.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) denies fevers, chills, dysuria, nausea, vomiting currently.

ERCP [**2162-8-26**]
-Impression: Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in
the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was
successful and deep with a balloon catheter using a free-hand
technique. Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial
opacification. Thick sludge was seen exuding out of the ampulla
after cannulation. A mild diffuse dilation was seen at the main
duct with the CBD measuring 10 mm. Multiple stones ranging in
size from 6 mm to 10 mm that were causing partial obstruction
were seen at the main duct. Given cholangitis, only limited
contrast injection was made.
Given cholangitis and elevated INR, a 5cm by 10FR double pig
tail biliary stent was placed successfully in the main duct.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
-Recommendations: Return to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. NPO overnight with aggressive
IV hydration as tolerated with LR at 100-150 cc/hr. Follow for
response and complications. If any abdominal pain, fever,
jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP fellow on
call ([**Pager number 8437**]). Continue IV antibiotics. Will need antibiotics
for total of 2 weeks. Can be transitioned to oral antibiotics
prior to discharge. Repeat ERCP in 5 weeks for stent removal and
extraction of stones. Hold coumadinn for 5 days prior to ERCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with CAD, Afib, HTN p/w hypotension requiring
pressors in setting of likely cholangitis.

Active Issues:

#Sepsis: Pt was initially hypotensive despite fluid
resuscitation and required BP support with norepinephrine.
Though his U/S is unchanged from prior study, in the setting of
his fever, hypotension, and rising enzymes and bili, most likely
cause is cholangitis. ERCP on [**8-26**] showed stones and some
sludge. Pt had stent placed but did not have sphincterotomy
given elevated INR. Pt had 1 of 4 bottles at OSH growing pan
sensitive E coli. Pt was initially treated with IV vancomycin
and unasyn. Weaned off norepinephrine [**2162-8-28**] once his paced
rate was increased from 65 to 85 bpm. WBC and LFTs continued to
down trend and normalized by the time of discharge. UA [**2162-8-27**]
concerning for UTI so Pt was started ciprofloxacin po.
Vancomycin and unasyn were discontinued on [**8-29**] given results of
blood cultures and switched to PO cipro at 750mg [**Hospital1 **] per ERCP
and pharmacy recs. He tolerated a regular diet and had complete
resolution of his abdominal pain. Pt needs repeat ERCP in 5
weeks, and will need to hold warfarin 5 days prior to procedure.
 He will need a total of 14 days of oral antibiotics to treat
the cholangitis.

#Hypotension: Presumed [**1-14**] sepsis in the setting of cholangitis.
Low cardiac output could also be contributing to the hypotension
since his BP responded to increasing his paced rate to 85 from
baseline 65. Pt needed norepinephrine to support BP despite
receiving fluids but was weaned off once his HR was increased.
TTE showed 45% LVEF, markedly dilated RA, moderately dilated LA.
Overall LV systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF = 45 %)
secondary to pacemaker-induced dyssynchrony and to ventricular
interaction, with a pressure/volume overloaded right ventricle.
Pt also had moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation,
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  These results
indicate that he is preload dependent and requires to be
hydrated optimally.  On transfer to the floor, however, and on
day of discharge to the [**Hospital1 1501**], he was significantly volume
overloaded with extensive LE edema and scrotal edema.  He was
given lasix 40 mg IV over last 3 days to assist in getting rid
of the extra fluid, and discharged on Lasix 40 mg PO daily.
Please continue to monitor his renal function and electrolytes
with diuresis.

# ? UTI. UA with pyuria. Pt asymptomatic but was started on
ciprofloxacin (see above). Urine cultures negative to date.

#Afib: Paced rhythm (See above). On warfarin with therapeutic
INR, Pt was given FFP  x 2 to correct coagulopathy but INR was
2.1 at time of ERCP, so no sphincterotomy was performed. Pt's
rate was increased to 85 given hypotension by EP service and was
reverted back to 60 by EP on discharge.  He tolerated this
reversion back to his baseline HR without any problems.  T
