Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular tachycardia, acute MI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous coronary intervention
ventricular tachycardia mapping and ablation

History of Present Illness:
74M with ischemic CM EF~10-15%, PVD, prior VF arrest, s/p ICD
placement on mexilitine and dofetilide at home.  Admitted to OSH
on [**3-31**] with complaints of feeling weak, found to be in
sustained VT @120bpm w/o ICD firing.  En route the patient was
cardioverted in the ambulance with 100J.  He was then admitted
to telemetry floor at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital but had VF arrest on
[**2140-4-2**], with successful shock from ICD.  Trop 5.4, CPK's just
over 100.  Mexilitine was discontinued and IV lido started at
2mg/kg/min.

On [**4-2**], he developed slurred speech and dizziness so lido was
held and then decreased to 1mg/min/kg.  Since starting the lido
he has been arrhythmia free, pacing at a rate of 60. At 10:30
p.m., he had an episode of VT 160-170's. He would have a run of
this and then the nurse would see him pacing for about 10 beats
at a rate in the 120's, then he would go back into VT
160-170's... eventually shocked x 2.- back to V paced. Entire
event was about 2 minutes. The patient was asymptomatic except
for some palpitations.  They then increased his lido to 2mg/min
after giving him a 50mg bolus.

Brief Hospital Course:
74M w/ischemic CM, PVD, prior VF arrest s/p ICD & on mexilitine
and dofetilide at home admitted to OSH w/VT @120 bpm and CP. At
OSH, found to have likely NSTEMI (Trop 5.4) & transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
for cath & EP study. Cath [**4-4**] w/80% RCA s/p 2 stents. Now
persistent VT and ICD firing, intubated on [**4-7**] electively to
sedate pt.

1. Cardiovascular:

a. Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has an ICD that was initially placed in
[**2132**] after an episode of VF arrest during his carotid
endarterectomy.   He was maintained on dofetilide, mexilitine
and metoprolol at home.

He presented to an OSH complaining of weakness and was found to
have an acute MI and episodes of VT.  Mexilitine was held and
lidocaine drip was started but discontinued after PCI on [**4-5**]
due to confusion and disorientation.  On [**4-7**], he received his
dofetilide dose somewhat late and developed persistent pulseful
VT.  Lidocaine was re-started.  The ICD settings were modified
and his heart rate was lowered back to 60bpm.  The ICD would
attempt to pace him out of the VT with anti-tachycardia pacing
but 1/3 episodes would cause him to be shocked.  He recieved
approximately 30 shocks.  For patient comfort, he was intubated
and sedated electively.  With the lower heart rate in addition
to switching lidocain to procainamide, the VT resolved. On
[**4-8**]- Went to EP and had ablation which was sucessful.
On [**4-10**], off of the dofetilide and procainamide, the patient was
still having NSVT.  EP recommended starting quinidine 324mg po
tid.  This was done, but then the pt developed severe diarrhea
and fever that was thought to be [**1-13**] quinidine.  He was then
started on procainamide, which he will be discharged on.  The
procainamide decreased the amount of NSVT to 1 or 2 runs of [**2-12**]
beats per 24 hours.  He continues to have palpitations.

b. Ischemia: On admission here, he ruled in for MI and went
straight to cath.  He was found to have lesions in his RCA.  Two
drug-eluting stents were placed without complications.  He will
continue aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol.  And

Post-op from the EP procedure, his ACEi moexipril was changed to
captopril.
c. Pump: EF 10-15% per echo in [**2125**], but the patient had no
signs or symptoms of decompensated heart failure.  He was kept
on strict I/O's.  Digoxin was discontinued as it is
arrythmogenic and he has been well-compensated.  He was also
kept on Moexipril 15 [**Hospital1 **], aldactone 25mg qd for hypokalemia,
lasix 80 PO qd for now.

2. Pulm: intubated electively [**4-7**] during persistent VT &
ICD firings to allow sedation. Successfully extubated [**4-9**].

3. Mental Status: confused but redirectable in holding area;
?apparently some correlation with lido administration, which
were relatively high doses. Not hypotensive. A head ct was done
for ?unequal pupils post-op but on clarification, he has had
unequal pupils since childhood. This mental status change
improved when lidocaine was stopped.

4. Thrombocytopenia:  His platelet count dropped slowly, heparin
dependent antibodies were sent and are neg.

5.  Diarrhea:  Pt developed severe diarrhea X 72 hours after one
dose of quinidine.  Stool studies were neg for infectous
etiology including C.diff.  This diarrhea was attributed to
quinidine and improved with holding of the medication.

6. Increasing Cr: The patient was noted on routine labs to have
an increasing creatinine on the day of discharge.  His aldactone
was held, and he was discharged to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35231**]
(general cardiology) in 1 week for re-check and follow up on
restarting aldactone.
