Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision.

DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] SOM [**Doctor First Name **] LE


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2152-8-23**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 3 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  Plavix was
started for poor targets.  AFib developed and amiodarone was
initiated and anticoaulation started. He transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  Sternal drainage
developed which prolonged his post-op course. He was started on
vanco, his sternal culture was negative, he remained afebrile
and WBC stable. The drainage subsided and was minimal at the
time of discharge. He was transitioned to PO Keflex for one
week.  Coumadin was started for AFib and plavix was dc'd.   The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD#7 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing with minimal drainage and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
