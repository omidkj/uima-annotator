History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname 5459**] is an 85 year old gentleman with history of COPD on
6L home O2 (FEV1 28% predicted), recurrent DVT on coumadin, and
recently diagnosed LUL NSCLC who is admitted with hypotension.
Today he was scheduled for LUL fiducial electrode placement and
was noted to have relative hypotension with [**Name (NI) 5462**] in the 90's.
.
His primary oncologist noted L > R weakness on examination and
neurology was consulted out of concern for potential stroke.
The patient dates the onset of worsening generalized weakness
and gait instability for the last 2 months, similar to around
the time he was diagnosed with LUL mass.
.
The patient complains of decreased PO intake and DOE, unchanged
from recent baseline.  He may have had one episode of dysuria
today but denies urinary frequency.  He denies fevers, chills,
headache, chest pain, SOB at rest, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, myalgias, rash.  Of note, the
patient was on a prednisone taper for COPD that ended the day
prior to admission.
.
In the ED, VS 97.2 77 81/52 16 94%4L NC.  The patient was given
3L NS, solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1, levaquin 750 mg IV x 1,
clindamycin 600 mg IV x 1, vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1, glucagon 2 mg
IV x 1, zofran 4 mg IV x 1, heparin gtt, and was briefly on
dopamine gtt.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**11-6**]: Since prior exam, there has been no significant
interval change. Persistent opacification at the left lung base
may represent pneumonia or atelectasis. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. There is no pneumothorax. The pulmonary
vasculature is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.
.
CT Head w/o contrast [**11-7**]: No acute intracranial pathology.
Please note that gadolinium-enhanced MRI is more sensitive for
the detection of intracranial masses.
.
MRI/MRA head
No evidence of metatstasis, masses, mass effect, or hemorrhage.
.
[**2115-11-7**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-10-21**],
there is worsening in right ventricular function with more right
ventricular dilation, increased severity of tricuspid
regurgitation, and increased estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

[**2115-11-15**] UGI Series
Free passage of the thin barium into the stomach without
evidence of obstruction or severe stricture or gross mass.
Evaluation of the mucosal surface is limited. If indicated,
please consider more dedicated study such as endoscopy.
.
[**2115-11-23**] CTA
No central or segmental pulmonary embolism, however,
subsegmental pulmonary emboli cannot be excluded given the
extent of atelectasis/collapse of the lower lobes.

2. Interval increase in the size of the cavitating left upper
lobe neoplasm with new bilateral lung lesions consistent with
disease progression.

3. Invasion of the left second rib by the left upper lobe
neoplasm.
.
[**2115-11-24**] CXR
.
FINDINGS:

Heart and mediastinum are within normal limits. There is no
appreciable change since the prior study. There are multifocal
opacities in left upper lobe as well as bilateral lower lobes.
The left upper lobe lesion is a known cavitary malignancy.

IMPRESSION:

No appreciable change since prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 y/o male with a h/o COPD on 6L home O2 (FEV1 28% predicted),
recurrent DVT on coumadin, and recently diagnosed LUL NSCLC who
was admitted with hypotension, new AF, and ARF. The patient was
initially admitted to the intensive care unit for hypotension,
which was thought due to a combination of dehydration and
adrenal insufficiency (patient had finished a steroid taper the
day before). After volume expansion and steroids, he was then
transferred to the floor on a steroid taper. He then developed
hypoxia worsening about [**11-16**] and had another brief few days in
the intensive care unit on stress dose steroids for respiratory
monitoring before he was transferred back to the oncology floor.
He has remained afebrile and feeling well on the floor except
for two episodes of obtundation due to the combination of
steroids, trazodone and ambien.
.
1. Dysphagia
Pt had issues with pain on swallowing and a "feeling of food
getting stuck in chest/epigastrium" ongoing for several weeks
which seemed to worsene over the admission. A barium swallow was
performed and there was no evidence of stricture or obstruction.
He had evidence of thrush in his mouth and he was empirically
treated with a course of fluconazole for pres
