HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year old gentleman
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] after ruling in for a
myocardial infarction.  Cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 3622**] showed a 99% left anterior descending lesion,
99% circumflex lesion, 40 to 50% right coronary artery lesion
with an ejection fraction of 50%.  The patient states that he
began experiencing midsternal chest pain radiating to arms
about one week ago.  The chest pain was associated with
shortness of breath and light-headedness and resolved after
thirty minutes of rest.  The patient states that he had
experienced up to ten episodes over the last week.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for evaluation for cardiac surgery.

1.  Nitroglycerin.
2.  Glucotrol 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 10 mg p.o. q.p.m.
3.  Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Tylenol p.r.n.
5.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 5.6,
hematocrit 38.5, platelet count 191,000.  Sodium 138,
potassium 4.7, chloride 103, bicarbonate 26, blood urea
nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.6, blood sugar 165.  Arterial blood
gases in room air revealed a pH 7.41, pCO2 34, pO2 89.

Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm at 63 beats per minute.  Q
wave in lead III, flipped T wave in V5 through V6.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake, alert and
oriented times three, conversant.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Strength is [**6-17**] in all four
extremities.  Sensation is intact in all dermatomes.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Sclera anicteric and noninjected.
Mucous membranes are moist.  No erythema or exudate.  Neck is
without bruits or jugular venous distention.  The neck is
supple.  The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The
heart is regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs.  The
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, with normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.  No
varicosities, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses and 2+ radial pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2142-3-8**].  The patient was taken
to the operating room on [**2142-3-9**], for his coronary artery
bypass graft times four with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**], left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein
graft to diagonal, saphenous vein graft to OM and saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery.

In the operating room, the patient underwent Transesophageal
Echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 45%,
trace to mild mitral regurgitation, mildly depressed left
ventricular systolic function, mild hypokinesis of mid and
apical segments of the anterolateral, anterior and
anteroseptal walls.

The patient was transferred from the operating room to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition. Please see operative
note for further details.  Initially in the Intensive Care
Unit, the patient was noted to have a large amount of chest
tube drainage with a labile blood pressure.  After a few
hours, it was decided that the patient should return to the
operating room for mediastinal reexploration for bleeding.

The patient was taken back to the operating room.  In the
operating room, it was found that the patient had bleeding in
the area of the internal mammary artery.  Bleeding was
repaired and the patient was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit, again in stable condition.  Please see
operative note for further details.

The patient required volume resuscitation as well as
Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain his blood pressure.
However, the patient had no further bleeding from chest
tubes.  The patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical
ventilation on the first postoperative evening.  On
postoperative day number one, the patient developed atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response which was able
to be controlled with intravenous Lopressor.  The patient was
started on oral Amiodarone load.

The patient's chest tubes were removed on postoperative day
number two.  Postchest tube removal, x-ray revealed free air
under his diaphragm on the right side.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable at that time.  The patient's abdominal
examination was benign.  Upright chest x-ray done later that
afternoon showed decreased amount of air under the right
hemidiaphragm from the study earlier that morning.  It was
decided that the pneumoperitoneum was due to chest tube
removal.  The patient remained stable.

Liver function tests were checked which were normal. The
patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on
postoperative day number three.  The patient continued to
experience periods of atrial fibrillation which converted
spontaneously into sinus rhythm versus sinus bradycardia.

Postoperative day number three, the patient was evaluated
with physical therapy.  It was felt that the patient would
benefit from rehabilitation placement postoperatively.  The
patient's pacing wires were removed on postoperative day
number four. The patient is awaiting discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.  Weight 76.2 kilograms
preoperatively.  The patient was 69 kilograms, pulse 56,
sinus bradycardia, blood pressure 132/66, respiratory rate
18, unlabored, room air oxygen saturation 97%.

Laboratory data from [**2142-3-13**], revealed white blood cell
count 7.9, hematocrit 31.1, platelet count 204,000.  Sodium
142, potassium 4.1, chloride 103, bicarbonate 29, blood urea
nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.7, glucose 123.

is regular rate and rhythm, positive rub, no murmur.  The
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen
revealed positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Sternum is stable, no erythema or drainage.
Lower extremities - saphenectomy site is clean and dry, no
erythema or drainage.

rhythm.
3.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  History of ETOH abuse.
6.  Fifty pack year tobacco history.

5.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times five days and then
400 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Glucotrol 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 10 mg p.o. q.p.m.
7.  Trazodone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Regular insulin sliding scale for blood sugar 150-200
three units subcutaneous, blood sugar 201-250 five units
subcutaneous, blood sugar 251-300 seven units subcutaneous,
blood sugar 301-350 ten units subcutaneous.
