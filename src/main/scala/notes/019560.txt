HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for liver
transplant. The patient was taken to the OR on [**2166-8-7**],
for a piggy back liver transplant for cirrhosis and hepatoma.
Surgeons were Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], assistants Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 69563**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], general anesthesia. The patient
received 5800 cc of crystalloid, 2 units of FFP, 1 unit of
packed red blood cells, EBL was approximately 300 cc. The
patient was stable and transferred to the surgical intensive
care unit, SICU. The patient was intubated upon entrance to
the ICU with 2 J-P drains and NG tube and a Foley catheter.
The patient's vital signs were stable. Postop labs: White
blood cell count 9.3, hematocrit 30.6, platelets 112,000.
Creatinine 0.8 with a BUN of 21 and a potassium of 4.5. ABGs
were stable. The patient did well postoperatively. The
patient was extubated on postop day 2. A liver duplex
[**Last Name (STitle) 950**] on postoperative day 1 was normal. The patient was
started on Prograf on postoperative day 1. The patient
received induction immunosuppression intraoperatively. This
consisted of 500 mg of Solu-Medrol, 1 gram of IV CellCept. On
postoperative day 1, hematocrit was 26.9 with a platelet
count of 85,000. The patient was transfused with 3 bags of
packed red blood cells, 5 bags of FFP and 3 bags of
platelets. Urine output was excellent with a creatinine of
0.8. LFTs postoperatively, AST was 2916, ALT 1069 and
alkaline phosphatase 94 with a total bilirubin of 9.2. The
patient was extubated on postoperative day 2. Preoperative
the patient's B viral load was negative. He received
hepatitis B immunoglobulin hospital days 1 through 8 as well
as lamivudine 100 mg p.o. daily. Hepatitis B titers were
followed throughout the hospital course. They were
nondetected up until postoperative day 5 when viral load is
greater than 450. The patient remained SHB-SAG negative
throughout this hospital course. Mr. [**Known lastname **] did well. He
was transferred from the SICU to the transplant medical
surgical unit on postoperative day 4 with stable vital signs.
Liver function tests had trended down with an AST of 247, ALT
of 458 and an alkaline phosphatase of 70 with a total
bilirubin of 2.6. Pathology results from intraoperative
hepatectomy revealed hepatocellular carcinoma with a 2 x 1.8
cm lesion. There was no vascular invasion, positive cirrhosis
with grade II inflammation. There were no vascular or biliary
margins detected. Chest x-ray on postoperative day 1 revealed
left base density. Preoperatively it was noted that the
patient had a left hemidiaphragm paralysis.

On postoperative day 2, it was noted that the patient's
platelets were lower at 68,000. Heparin antibody was sent
off. This was subsequently detected as positive. The patient
underwent a line change on postoperative day 4, a nonheparin
coated line. Chest x-ray confirmed placement. There was no
CHF or pneumonia noted at that time. The patient's diet was
advanced slowly. Abdomen remained soft with 2 J-Ps. Medial J-
P was removed on postoperative day 5 as well as the lateral J-
P for 35 and 55 cc, respectively.

Throughout the hospital course, the patient's blood sugars
fluctuated according to the Solu-Medrol taper. [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted. Sliding scale insulin was used to treat the high
or elevated glucoses. Pain was managed with IV Dilaudid with
good results. Breath sounds remained diminished at the bases
with O2 saturations in the mid 90s on 2 liters nasal cannula.
On postoperative day 4, IV medications were switched to p.o.
medications. The patient was ambulatory and doing well.
Physical therapy was consulted for assessment. The patient
was passing flatus and tolerating a regular diet, voiding
large amounts of yellow urine. Lasix was started on
postoperative day 4. The patient's weight had increased 10
kilograms. The patient slowly began to diurese throughout the
hospital course on IV Lasix.

Hepatology followed along closely throughout this
hospitalization. The patient was converted to IM hepatitis B
immunoglobulin on day 8. Clinical nutrition was consulted for
assessment of fair intake. The patient was given Boost
supplements, 2 cans per day, and encouraged to drink at least
3 cans per day. Abdomen remained soft with positive bowel
sounds and he was passing flatus. Physical
