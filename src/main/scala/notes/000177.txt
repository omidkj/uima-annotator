Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.2 BP 91/45 leg cuff: P: 76  R:15  O2: 98%
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress, patient annoyed by
frequent questions.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, EOMI
Neck: supple, NO JVD.
Lungs: CTA BL
Chest: HD port in place on left, but is non-tender,
non-erythematous, witn no pus, fluctuance, or induration noted
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,

no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: no cyanosis or edema, chronic atrophic skin changes in LE
bilaterally, swollen right knee, atrophic muscles in calfs.
Multiple scars from prior vascular access in arms b/l.
Neuro: CN 2-12 intact, sensation throughout, [**4-27**] stregnth
throughout, small pinpoint pupils, EOM intact, A+O x3. Attention
intact, [**2-24**] recall at 5 minutes. Mild dysarthria. Subtle right
sided facial droop. Wears corrective eyeware.

Pertinent Results:
HIP MRI: [**2119-2-22**]
RESULT PENDING.

Right Knee HIP XR:
INDICATION: Right knee pain.
COMPARISON: Right knee radiograph on [**2120-1-17**]. CT-Torso
on [**2117-11-15**].

Single AP view of the pelvis. Additional view of the right hip
and two views
of the right knee.

RIGHT HIP: There is a deformity of the right acetabulum,
suggesting an old
fracture. Heterotopic ossification is seen in bilateral hips.
The SI joints
are not visible and probably fused. There is compression
deformity of the
right femoral head with joint space narrowing and subchondral
sclerosis of the
acetabulum, not seen on prior CT-Torso on [**2117-11-15**].
This finding is
suggestive of avascular necrosis.

RIGHT KNEE: Marked muscle wasting is seen in the right lower
extremity with
marked demineralization. The large spur on the inferior aspect
of the patella
is unchanged from [**2120-1-17**]. There is no acute fracture or
dislocation in
the right knee.

Impression: Probable old fracture of the right acetabulum along
with marked
muscle wasting (suggestng paraplegia). Probably fusion of the SI
joints may
reflect spondyloarthropathy or relate to ? paraplegia. Probable
AVN
rightfemoral head.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
