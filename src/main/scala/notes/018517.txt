Brief Hospital Course:
46 M with history of ETOH abuse, here with ETOH withdrawal,
possible pneumonia, and chest pain.
.
# ETOH withdrawal:  He reports drinking 1 pint of vodka daily
and his last drink was the day prior to admission.  He was put
on a CIWA scale for alcohol withdrawal and was monitored in the
ICU for a day before he was called out to the regular Medicine
service.  His LFTs and pancreatic enzymes were elevated on
admission and consisted with alcohol hepatitis.  This normalized
over this hospital course and patiet was not requiring any
benzodiazepenes on day of discharge.  This was likely the source
of his chest pain.
.
# ETOH abuse: He was given multivitamin, thiamine and folate.
Social work was consulted to discuss his homeless situation and
his alcoholism.
.
# Chest pain: He was ruled out by three sets of cardiac enzymes.
 His EKG showed RBBB but there was no old EKG for comparison.
He chest pain could be from costochondritis since he was tender
to the chest wall.  He was given NSAIDs and this resolved over
his hospital course.  He was monitored on telemetry without
events.
.
# Possible retrocardiac opacity on CXR:  Given his low grade
fever and cough, he was treated with levoquin x 7 days.  He
defervesced and remained stable.
.
# h/o asthma: Albuterol and atrovent inhalers
.
# Pancytopenia: Likely from alcohol.
.
# Question of diabetes: Normal blood glucose, but urine glucose
1000 and ketones 150.  He was put on QID fingersticks and
regular insulin sliding scale.
.
.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
