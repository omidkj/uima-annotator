SOCIAL HISTORY:  Admitted to smoking one pack a day,

FAMILY HISTORY:  Had a positive family history.  His father
died of myocardial infarction at age 47.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 98.9, blood
pressure 143/64, heart rate 62, regular, saturating 99
percent on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination was unremarkable.  He had jugular venous
distension, no lymphadenopathy palpable.  Heart was regular
rate and rhythm with S1, S2, tones no murmur, rub or gallop.
Lungs were clear bilaterally with distant breath sounds
bilaterally.  Abdomen had some mild epigastric tenderness, no
distention, no masses, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities
had no edema.  He had some rare 1 mm scabbed over papules on
his left shoulder and back, nontender, nonpruritic.

Chest x-ray showed no infiltrate, no congestive heart failure
or effusion.  His electrocardiogram showed normal axis with
sinus rhythm at 75 with 1 to [**Street Address(2) 37964**] elevations in V1
through V3.  Biphasic T waves in V2 through V3 consistent
with his prior electrocardiogram on [**2179-12-8**].  Only the T wave
changes were new.  Please refer to his electrocardiogram done
on [**2179-12-23**] for official report.  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2179-12-7**] did show three vessel disease.  He received three
stents to his left anterior descending coronary artery and
balloon angioplasty to his third obtuse marginal, AV groove
circumflex and left posterior descending coronary artery.
His ejection fraction at that time was 46 percent with an
left ventricular ejection fraction of 13.

He was admitted through the emergency room.  Laboratories
prior to the catheterization were as follows;  troponin T
0.02, saturation of 35, potassium of 5.6.  Chloride 99,
bicarb 21, BUN 24, creatinine 1.0, blood sugar 101, anion gap
21, CK 135 with MB of 3.  White count of 5.9, hematocrit
31.6, platelet count 357,000.  PT 12.2, PTT 24.4, INR 0.9.
Urinalysis was negative.  Given his current symptoms the
patient went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on the
cardiology service which showed a clot in the left anterior
descending coronary artery, restenosis in the circumflex and
he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] for emergent coronary artery
bypass graft.  On the 23rd he went to the operating room for
emergent coronary artery bypass grafting times two with a
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
coronary artery, a vein graft to the obtuse marginal and a
vein graft sequentially to the posterior descending coronary
artery.  He was transferred to the cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition on a Neo-Synephrine drip at 0.8
mcg per kilogram per minute and titrated propofol drip.

On postoperative day one he was hemodynamically stable on a
Neo-Synephrine drip at 2.5 mcg per kilograms per minute.  He
was restarted on his aspirin and Plavix and continued with
his perioperative vancomycin.  His white count was 8.3,
hematocrit 31.8, platelet count 286,000, potassium 4.5, BUN
17, creatinine 0.9.  He remained intubated.  He was stable
and remained in the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  He
was seen by his [**Hospital6 **] Center physician who
made suggestions for his antiretroviral therapy protocol and
his HIV medications were restarted.  On postoperative day two
he had no events overnight.  He was extubated.  His maximum
temperature was 100.  He was hemodynamically stable in sinus
rhythm, saturating 94 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His
creatinine and white count were stable.  He was doing well.
His Swan was discontinued.  His Neo-Synephrine continued to
be weaned.  Chest tubes were discontinued and his Foley was
pulled and he was encouraged to ambulate.

On the 26th his Cordis was discontinued.  Peripheral
intravenous was placed.  He was transferred out to the floor.
His examination was unremarkable.  His incisions were clean,
dry and intact.  He continued to be seen every day by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 37965**], his [**Hospital1 778**] staff physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was encouraged to
continue using the incentive spirometer and work on pulmonary
toilet as well as ambulation with physical therapy and the
nursing staff.  On postoperative day four he had a blood
pressure of 124/76 with sinus rhythm at 78.  His beta
blockage with Lopressor continued as well as Lasix diuresis.
He continued on his triple antiviral therapy as well as his
Plavix.  His examination was relatively unremarkable.
Incisions were clean, dry and intact.  His epicardial pacing
wires were to be removed during the day that day.  He was
saturating 95 percent on room air.  He had somewhat of a flat
affect but otherwise appeared to be alert and oriented with a
nonfocal examination.  Psychiatry consult was requested and
done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16293**] for his history of depression
and the assessment was based on his current examination and
he appeared safe for discharge with outpatient follow up and
they recommended that his Prozac be continued.  He was also
seen by case management and patient's desire was to be
discharged to home and his roommate will be with him.

Patient would be discharged with [**Hospital6 407**]
services.  On the day of discharge he was receiving Percocet
PRN and ibuprofen for P.O. pain control.  He had good bowel
sounds.  Discharge planning was done.  His examination was
unremarkable.  Incisions were clean, dry and intact.  He was
performing all of his activities of daily living and his last
laboratories were hematocrit of 27.3.  The patient was deemed
well enough to be discharged to home with Visiting Nurse
