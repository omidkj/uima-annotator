[**2175-9-21**] Head CT scan
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology. Age-related
atrophy.
Periventricular white matter ischemic changes are chronic.

[**2175-9-21**] Cervical spine CT scan
IMPRESSION:
1. Fractures through the left C2 and C3 transverse processes
extending into
the foramen transversarium. These fractures put the patient at
increased risk
for possible vertebral dissection which could be better
evaluated with a
dedicated CTA or MRA (with T1 fat supression sequences) of the
neck.

2. Nondisplaced fracture of the right lamina of C2.

3. Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine
including C2-C3
moderate to severe spinal stenosis. In the setting of trauma,
these
degenerative changes put the patient at increased risk for
ligamentous injury
or cord injury, which cannot be fully evaluated by CT and would
recommend MRI
for further evaluation if clinical suspicion for neck injury
persists.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Small LV cavity.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Mild AS (AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve
chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild to
moderate ([**12-14**]+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Moderate
[2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for
PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


[**2175-9-22**] MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]; Thoracic Spine

CERVICAL SPINE: Fractures of C2 and C3 are better visualized on
the recent
CT.

Prevertebral soft tissue swelling extends from C2 to the
inferior endplate of
C4. While this implies ligamentous injury, no definite
ligamentous injury is
identified.

Epidural hematoma is seen posteriorly, extending from C2 through
the inferior
endplate of T2. In addition, there are multiple disc
herniations/bulges.
These combined changes result in narrowing of the spinal canal,
however, there
is no cord signal abnormality to suggest cord compression.

At C2-3, there is left paracentral disc protrusion. At C3-4,
disc bulge
compresses upon the ventral aspect of the thecal sac. At C4-5,
there is canal
narrowing due to midline and left foraminal disc protrusion that
indents the
cord and narrows the left neural foramen.

At C5-6, high signal within the disc space anteriorly indicates
an annular
tear. Osteophyte indents the ventral aspect of the cord. This
may be acute
or chronic, although there is no associated prevertebral soft
tissue swelling.

At C6-7, disc herniation indents the cord, however, there is no
cord signal
abnormality.

There is blood within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**], seen on the most
superior axial
images (5:2).

THORACIC SPINE: An acute T12 compression fracture with
retropulsed bone
severely narrows the spinal canal, however, there is no cord
deformity and the
spinal cord demonstrates normal signal. There is acute
compression fracture
of T2, without retropulsion. A T4 compression deformity is
chronic.

At T6-7, disc protrusion results in cord compression, although
this is not
acute.

IMPRESSION:
1. Blood in the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Followup head CT is
recommended.
2. Prevertebral cervical hematoma. While this is suggestive of
ligamentous
injury, no ligamentous injury is identified.
3. Cervical prevertebral hematoma, epidural hematoma and disc
herniations/protrusions result and narrowing of the cervical
spinal canal,
however, there is no evidence of cord compression.
4. Acute compression fracture of T2.
5. Acute T12 compression fracture with retropulsed bone,
severely narrowing
the canal. No cord deformity or cord signal abnormality is
identified. FINDINGS: Previously placed left-sided PICC line
cannot be identified at the
present study in the left arm or chest. Left retrocardiac
opacity is
unchanged. Interval development of pleural effusion bilaterally.
Old right-
sided rib fractures are again seen. Compression deformity of a
lower thoracic
vertebral body again seen. The nasogastric tube was removed. A
G-tube
projects in the left upper quadrant.





Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Orthopedic spine surgery
was consulted given her injuries which were non operative. She
was fitted for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 36323**] brace (TLSO with a cervical extension)
and began working with Physical therapy thereafter. Because of
her rib fractures she remained in the Trauma ICU for several
days because of concern for her pulmonary status. There were
initial discussions regarding the possibility that she would
require a tracheostomy for airway management. She was able to
manage her airway effe
