Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yoM w/ CAD s/p CABG, AF and HTN who presented s/p mechanical
fall  and was found to have hypotension which resolved with 1 L
of NS and  PNA.

Pneumonia: CRX concerning for RML mass on top of PNA which may
be multilobar with also LLL involvement. Responding to
levofloxacin with rapid clinical imporvement and now nl room air
oxygen.
- Continued on levofloxacin renally dosed
- A CT was performed which did not reveal a mass, but showed a
large AAA.

Sepsis: resolved. Lactate improved from 8.3 -> 1.8 and his BP
normalized with only 1 L NS and early antibiotic Tx suggesting
that volume depletion may have been the main culprit.
Blood Cx negative to date.

s/p Fall: pt had witnessed mechanical fall w/o LOC or head
trauma. Head CT and C-spine CT were also negative for new acute
pathology including bleed or fx. Most likely etiology was
weakness from underlying infection.
-Fall precautions were instituted. He was evaluated by PT who
assessed him able to go [**Last Name (un) 6529**] home from the hospital without
any further rehab.

CAD: minimal lateral ST depressions on EKG with positive CK MB
and trop leak, asymptomatic. Possibly demand ischemia caused by
transient hypotension and infection.
- Continued on ASA, lipitor, and BB

HTN: normotensive now. Pt usually on aldactone and BB. He
ignores the doses.
-He was restarted on a low dose of aldactone and lopressor.

CRI: Cr was initially elevated at 1.8 from a baseline of Cr
1.4-1.7. This resolved over 24 hours with hydration and it was
attributed to prerenal etiology

AF: anticoagulation was held for possible procedure upon arrival
to micu. INR therapeutic at 2.7
-restart on coumadin at 5mg po qd in am. At d/c his INR was 3.2
