Service: OTOLARYNGOLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8480**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, neck stiffness







CT brain without contrast (no films available, just the report):

[**Last Name (un) 2043**] destruction involving skull base clivus in close
approximation to sphenoid sinus. Numerous gas bubbles within the

brain predominantly extra axial suggesting a communication
between the brain and sphenoid sinus. No acute edema.
Ventricular
system is moderately prominant. Apart from tissue within the
sphenoid sinus, the sinuses are well aerated.

Impression: This is a 68 year old man visiting MA from [**Country 11150**],
history of chordoma of the clivus s/p resection x 2 and XRT with

diplopia at baseline who presents with meningitis both
clinically
and by LP results, preceeded by clear leakage from the nose
(CSF?) and multiple bouts of emesis. CT from OSH suggests a
connection between sinus and brain.

Plan:
1. Meningitis, bacterial (primarily polys) with low glucose
relative to [**Name2 (NI) **] glucose. Possible infectious etiologies
include streptococcus and staph, listeria, any lung/sinus
pathogens, more unusual pathogens like TB given he is from
[**Country 11150**].
Consider gas forming bugs given "air bubbles" in brain (which
are most likely from communication with sinus).
- will treat broadly with vanco, ceftriaxone, ampicillin and
flagyl at meningitic doses, renally dosed
- follow CSF cx data from [**Hospital1 **]
- pan culture if spikes
- consult ID tonight re: managment, antibiotic choices
- ENT called from [**Location **] to consult re: need for evaluation of CSF
leak.
- check CXR for infiltrates, TB nodules
- swab throat for strep, culture
- tylenol for fever, pain
- airborne precautions
- q 2 hr neuro checks, watch for complications of meningitis
including stroke,venous thrombosis, abscess/empyema, change in
neurologic exam, seizures, further decline in mental status.

2. Chordoma
- will check MRI brain for further characterization of anatomy,
is there more/new tumor? REquested per neurosurgery and ID.
Appreciate neurosurgery recommendations.

3. Hyponatremia
- check Na tonight to ensure not falling
- likely secondary to dehydration given fever, illness,
decreased
PO intake, although could be secondary to SIADH.
- IVF for now with q 12 hr na checks

4. Asthma
- prn albuterol

5. Hyperglycemia
- RISS and FS QID. no known dx of diabetes. monitor closely.

PPx: protonix, SC heparin, pneumoboots, inspiration spirometer
FEN: house diet, IVF

Dispo: pending workup


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Image-guided endoscopic sinus surgery
with endoscopic repair of left cribriform plate cerebrospinal
fluid leak with left superior turbinate graft and repair of
sella turcica cerebrospinal fluid CSF leak with left middle
turbinate.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old Hindi (with some English) speaking
man with history of clivus chordoma tumor resection x 2 who
presents from [**Hospital **] hospital with headache, fever, neck pain.
Neurology was consulted to assess his neurologic function.

Patient is visiting his daughter in [**Name (NI) **] from [**Name (NI) 11150**], and has
been here in the US for the past month. He was in his usual
state of health until last week when on Monday and Tuesday he
noted profuse clear discharge from his nose (saturating his
sleeves), non-pus-like, occuring monday and tuesday. It then
cleared up on his own. This has happened in the past, and
although this fluid has never been confirmed to be CSF (per
wife)
he was treated with antibiotics. Yesterday, he vomited 3 times
"undigested food" and complained of belly discomfort. Later in
the evening his mental status changed, he became lethargic, eyes

open but not responding to his wife, starring, speaking
nonsensically. [**Name (NI) **] wife brought him to [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] this AM
after his son-n-law, a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] concerned re: his health.

Workup was done at [**Hospital1 **] that included temp 104 degrees F, WBC

21K, LP consistent with bacterial meningitis (was given 2
grams CTX, 1 gram vanco, and here given 1 gram ampicillin and
500mg flagyl) and CT head that suggests a communication of the
brain with the sphenoid sinus. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
neurosurgical
backup.

Since last night, wife feels his condition has improved
significantly as he is more interactive, talking. He reports
headache, "bursting", bitemporal in location. Neck is stiff and
painful. Light bothers his eyes. He denies localized weakness,
although feels weak all over, and denies numbness. He has
baseline double vision from chordoma (see PMHx), no difficulty
swallowing or chewing, although his PO intake has been poor for
over 24 hrs. He felt hot yesterday to his wife, and at [**Hospital1 **]
was febrile to 104. He denies cough, recent pneumonia, sinus
pain or infections, chest pain, belly pain, skin changes/rash.
No
recent instrumentation of his sinuses, last surgery on chordoma
was in [**2157**]. No recent dental work, no tooth pain. No TB
infection to his knowledge although likely has been exposed in
Inida. He is from the capital of [**Country 11150**], [**Location (un) 63959**] and lives in an
[**Location (un) **] with his wife, the [**Name2 (NI) **] is in good condition.

Past Medical History:
1. s/p transsphenoidal chordoma resection x 2 in [**Country 11150**], [**2144**] and

[**2157**]. First presented with diplopia (horizontal) that resolved
after first resection. He again developed diplopia and was found

to have recurrence of his chordoma, was resected [**2157**], but the
diplopia persisted. Each resection was followed by XRT therapy.
No chemo. Most recent MRI [**2-16**] (per report wife gives us, copy
is in chart) shows no signif change, no new lesion.
2. asthma
3. gastritis
4. bilateral cataract surgery
