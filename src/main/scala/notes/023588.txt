EKG [**2156-3-15**]: Sinus rhythm First degree A-V delay, Left atrial
abnormality.
[**Month (only) 116**] be otherwise normal ECG, but unstable baseline makes
assessment difficult. Since previous tracing of [**2155-9-23**],
probably no significant change.

Radiology:
[**2156-3-15**] CT CHEST:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary embolus.
2. Extensive pulmonary disease, including fibrosis and
honeycombing. There is superimposed failure. Additionally, the
more confluent confluent opacities in the dependent right lung
may represent aspiration pneumonia, particluarly in light of a
hiatal hernia and patulous esophagus.
3. Ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal lines, most
likely representing failure.
4. Extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy, differential diagnosis
includes reactive lymphadenopathy versus lymphoma.
5. Left hepatic 11-mm liver lesion, incompletely characterized.
MR may be performed if further evaluation is desired.
6. Cardiomegaly, coronary artery disease.

[**2156-3-16**] CXR: Mild interstitial edema has worsened congestion and
mild volume loss in the right upper lobe is chronic, possibility
a function of mild upper lobe bronchial narrowing due to
adenopathy seen on the chest CT [**3-15**]. Borderline cardiomegaly
and moderate-sized hiatus hernia, unchanged. Small bilateral
pleural effusion may be present. Thoracic aorta is generally
large and tortuous, but unchanged in caliber compared to recent
prior studies. No pneumothorax.

[**2156-3-16**] ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF 80%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2151-2-24**], the pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is increased; otherwise the findings are
similar.

[**2156-3-17**] CXR: Multiple chronic changes. New
consolidation/aspiration on the left.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis and
dysphagia presents with respiratory distress, likely due to a
flare of his known IPF and chronic aspiration. The patient was
initially admitted to the ICU, subsequently transferred out to
the general medical floor.

1) Interstitial fibrosis: The patient was started empirically on
steroids, of which he will continue a slow outpatient taper. The
case was discussed with his outpatient pulmonolgist, who noted
that, unfortunately, this is end-stage interstitial fibrosis for
which there are no additional treatment options. Despite maximal
treatment (steroids, antibiotics, bronchodilators), the
patient's clinical status did not improve significantly. After
extensive discussion with the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy and
family, it was decided that the patient would be discharged to a
[**Hospital1 1501**] with hospice services, given his very poor prognosis and the
family's desire to keep him as comfortable as possible.

2) Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a known history of
dysphagia, and was noted on chest CT to have more confluent
confluent opacities in the dependent right lung likely
representing aspiration pneumonia. He was begun on a 14 day
course of levofloxacin and metronidazole. He was evaluated by
the speech and swallow service, who recommended pureed solids
and thick liquids, with close observation during feeding.

3) Esophageal diverticlum/dysmotility: The patient was treated
by continuing home dose of zelnorm.  Given aspiration event,
speech swallow was consulted with recs noted below.  Given
hiatal hernia/GERD; his PPI was changed to Carafate liquid.

4) Urinary retention: The patient was noted to have recurrent
urinary retention, despite continuing his home dose of
terazosin. A foley was placed for patient comfort, although a
voiding trial can also be considered as an outpatient.

5) Hypertension: The patient was continued on his home doses of
amlodipine and atenolol.

6) Type II diabetes: The patient's glyburide was held throughout
his hospital stay. His fingersticks were initially monitored,
however, given minimal insulin requirement and a desire to
maintain the patient's comfort, this was discontinued.

7) DNR/DNI: The patient was discharged to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with hospice
services.
