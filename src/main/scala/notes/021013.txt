Date of Birth:  [**2115-2-7**]             Sex:   F

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Provera

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, orthopnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial window
Inferior vena cava filter

History of Present Illness:
Patient complaining of SOB and dry cough x 5 days especially
with any type of exertion. Patient is currently getting
chemotherapy for peritoneal cancer.  No fevers or chills.  No
URI Sx. Unchanged Nausea and vomiting.  Positive constipation,
no diarrhea.  Patient unable to lay flat.  Patient reports that
this feels similar to a few years ago when she had pleural
effusions requiring a tap.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 99 112/93 30 100.  97% 4L NC.  Her
exam was notable for decreased breath sounds on the right.  A
chest X-ray confirmed the presence of a large pleural effusion
and there was a question of an infiltrate and so the patient was
given vanc/cefepime to cover HAP.  She was noted to be
tachycardic and so was given 1.5L NS without improvment in her
tachycardia.  She was also given morphine 2mg and zofran 4mg for
pain.  There was also confern for a pericardial effusion based
on her CXR.  A bedside ultrasound revealed what appeared to be a
moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of RV collapse.
Patient was transferred to the MICU for further care which
included a pericardial drainage.
.
Upon transfer to the OMED floor, she is breathing more
comfortably with the pericardial drain removed. She is still
tachypneic, still tachycardic.

Past Medical History:
.
Past Oncologic History: *per most recent clinic note, with
updates*
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented with dyspnea and a pleural effusion in
12/[**2166**]. Pleural fluid cytology was consistent with poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma. CT showed a moderate amount of
intra-abdominal ascites and enhancing nodularity within the
peritoneal/omental fat consistent with carcinomatosis/omental
caking. CA-125 was elevated at 909. On [**2167-12-23**] she underwent a
thoracoscopy with pleurodesis, biopsy of the left parietal
pleura and right percutaneous drainage of pleural effusion.
There was bulky metastatic disease within the pleural space. She
started carboplatin and paclitaxel on [**2167-12-31**]. After 3 cycles,
she underwent surgical debulking and TAH/BSO by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2028**] on
[**2168-3-31**]. She was optimally debulked and had minimal residual
disease. She received 3 additional cycles of carboplatin/taxol
post-operatively, last treatment on [**2168-6-15**]. Her CA 125 started
trending up in [**4-3**]. CT torso in [**6-3**] was notable for a right
sided pleural effusion which was malignant based on cytology
from thoracentesis on [**2169-7-28**]. She started carboplatin/taxol
again on [**2169-8-17**]. She had recurrent pleural effusion and
underwent thoracentesis on [**2169-9-14**] and again in [**12-6**]. She
underwent talc pleurodesis on [**2170-1-10**]. CT on [**2170-2-14**] showed new
mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy as well as
markedly increased soft tissue thickening along the right
pleura, extending into the anterior mediastinum. She started
Doxil on [**2170-2-21**]. She stopped after 7 cycles because her CA 125
rose and her CT was unchanged. She was given a chemotherapy
break. However, she developed rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy
in her neck in 11/[**2169**]. She started Navelbine 30mg/m2 on
[**2170-11-1**]. She received D1 and D8 doses, but was neutropenic on
D15.
.
Navelbine was dose reduced to 25mg/m2 during her second cycle,
but she again became neutropenic and the D15 dose was held. Her
regimen was changed to Navelbine 30mg/m2 on D1 and D15 of a 28
day cycle and each dose is being followed with neulasta. Her
CA-125 decreased from 340 to 167 after 3 cycles, but then rose
to 273 in early 3/[**2170**]. Vaginal biopsy on [**2171-2-21**] performed due
to vaginal bleeding was notable for metastatic poorly
differentiated carcinoma. Patient started gemcitabine C1 D1 on
[**2171-10-3**]. She completed 4 cycles of gemcitabine until having
her dose held on [**2172-1-23**] due to concern of either progression
of disease or gemcitabine pulmonary toxicity causing. On
[**2172-2-11**], patient began external beam radiotherapy to a dose of
3000 cGy in 10 fractions.
