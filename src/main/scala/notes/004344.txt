altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:

enceophalopathy and ascites well-known to the MICU who was
transferred from the Liver service for encephalopathy.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] has been at rehab since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2148-8-21**]. Per his mother he has been having more frequent
encephalopathic episodes this month. Over the past few days she
reports that [**Known firstname **] has been in good health without fevers, night
sweats, n/v, or abdominal pain. Over the last few days he has
been having ~6BMs/day. Notably, she reports the rehab would not
increase the lactulose frequency from Q4hr which [**Known firstname **] often
requires when he is becoming encephalopathic.
.
Notably, patient's most recent admission [**Date range (1) 77611**] was also for
changes in mental status. He was found to have a Klebsiella
bacteremia and UTI treated with 3 weeks of ceftriaxone ([**2148-8-5**],
to complete on [**2148-8-26**]). Neurologic work-up demonstrated that he
has a comunicating hydrocephalus, etiology of which remains
unclear.
.
In the ED Vitals: 78 98/63 18 99% RA. He received 30mL of PO
lactulose as well as Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl for question of
infection.He received 2L NS. CXR with mild atelectasis. Duplex
U/S showed flow in L portal vein, pt combative and this could
not be completed.
.
In the ICU, patient able to follow directions though continued
to have agitated outbursts. Denied any pain or discomfort.

Imaging/Studies:
CXR: Left and right mid lung subsegmental atelectasis. No focal

consolidation or pulmonary edema.
.
ABD U/S: 1. Cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly.
2. Limited doppler exam without evaluation of the main portal
vein. If there is high clinical concern for vascular thrombosis,
a CT is suggested. 3. Cholelithiasis.
.
ABD US [**8-13**]
1. Flow within the main portal vein, now demonstrates a
hepatofugal
(reversed) directionality (as demonstrated on a prior study from
[**2148-1-21**]) although patent. Flow within the left portal vein
could not be obtained no doppler evaluation either secondary to
occlusion or very slow flow in this uncooperative patient.
2. Shrunken cirrhotic liver consistent with known cirrhosis.
Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall edema/thickening unchanged
over multiple comparisons likely secondary to third spacing from
decompensated liver disease rather than acute cholecystitis.
3. Large amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
.
Head CT [**8-15**]: No interval change in moderate ventriculomegaly.
No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
MRI Head [**7-23**]: 1. Prominent lateral ventricles with evidence for
transependymal CSF flow suggestive of communicating
hydrocephalus; also prominence of the sulci suggestive of
atrophy.
2. No acute intracranial process.
Unchanged diffuse hydrocephalus since [**2148-7-15**] (new since [**2148-1-21**])
with mild transependymal CSF flow.
.
CSF Fluid: neg cryptococcal, fungal
WBC 0-2, Polys 0, Lymphs 0-56


Brief Hospital Course:
41 year old man with cirrhosis secondary to EtOH and HCV,
complicated by recurrent ascites, history of SBP and esophageal
varices, who has been hospital w/ recurrent episodes of
encephalopathy presents with an episode of encephalopathy.
 .
# Recurrent encephalopathy:  Presentation secondary to
inadequate bowel regimen while at rehab facility. Work up
negative for infection (stool, blood, urine), GI bleed, and U/S
failed to show significant ascites.  A CT of abdomen was done to
evaluate questionable poor flow through the portal vein seen on
US.  The CT was sig for patent portal vein.  Patient was treated
with rifaximin and Q2hr lactulose and produced ~4L of stools per
day.  Mental status improved to baseline on discharge.  Cipro
was continued for SBP prophylaxis. He was also continued on his
vegetarian diet.  A decision was made to discharge patient home
w/ services as mother felt that she could provide better care at
home.  Physical therapy was consulted who agreed that the
patient could be discharged home.
.
# Hypernatremia: Secondary to reduced access to free water in
the setting of encephalopathy and high stool output. Resolved
with free water replacement.
.
# ESLD. Secondary EtOH and HCV. Patient initially presented with
improved ascites and edema. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed
poor flow through the portal vein, and CT of the abdomen was
done for further assessment.  The CT demonstrated patent portal
vein.  Patient was continued on his lactulose and rifaximin as
above.  He was also continued on cipro for SBP ppx, his home
diuretics and ppi.  Octreotide and midodrine were discontinued
while in the ICU.  The patient's creatine remained stable off
treatments.  Patient was ultimately disharged to home (see
above).
.
# H/o HRS: Octreotide and midodrine discontinued while in the
ICU and were held throughout his hospital course. Creatinine
stable off octreotide and midodrine.
.
# Anemia: Initial hct of 23 lower than baseline of 25-28.
Patient hcts were followed throughout hospitalization and were
stable.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Stable and secondary to liver disease.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable, patient was continued on home
levothyroxine.
.
# Pulmonary HTN: There were no active issues during his
hospitalization and the patient was continued iloprost.
.
# Osteoporosis: Patient was continued on his home regimen of Vit
D and Calcium
