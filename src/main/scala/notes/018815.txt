pCXR [**2173-9-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Small left pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
75M with CAD s/p CABGx2 and multiple caths, EF 35%, moderate AS,
PPM DM2, who now presents with shortness of breath and
tachycardia.  Diagnosed with acute on chronic systolic heart
failure exacerbation with troponin leak.
.
1. Cardiac:
a. Coronaries:
The patient had no chest pain symptoms, though was found to have
elevated troponins in the setting of CHF. The peak troponin was
up to 0.35, peak CK 173, MB 18. These were noted to be trending
dow. The mild enzyme elevation was likely attributable to CHF vs
demand ischemia. There is a history of CAD s/p cabg x2. Cath
[**3-6**] at [**Hospital1 1774**] revealed patent grafts. The patient was continued
on aspirin, plavix, lipitor 80, Beta blocker.
.
b. Pump:
The patient presented intially with CHF and he was diuresed to
euvolemic. There is a history of CHF with EF 35%. He was
continued on beta blocker and ACE.
.
c. Rhythm:
There is a history of paroxysmal afib on coumadin. Pacemaker was
for for 2:1 AV block [**6-4**]. In the ED, the patient was noted to
have a complex rhythm which showed pacer spikes. This was
consistent with an SVT with pacer tracking. There was initially
concern in the ED for possible ventricular tachycardia though
review of the ECG strip by cardiology confirmed that this was
not the case. The ECG showed a sinus tachycardia with
ventricular pacing.
.
d. Valves:
There is a history of aortic stenosis, [**Location (un) 109**] 1.1 mean gradient 32
by cath at [**Hospital1 1774**] [**2173-3-12**]. The plan is for non-operative
management per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] since pt is a poor surgical candidate and
has complex aortic atheroma
.
2. Epistaxis:
There was heavy bleeding on presentation, enough to fill a cup
or two per the patient. This was controlled with the nasal
packing by ENT. The packing was left in place until the day
prior to discharge. Coumadin was held initially. The plan for
anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy was discussed with the
patient's outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended
continuing dual anti-platelet therapy given the concern for
stent thrombosis, which the patient was assessed as high risk
for this given his coronary anatomy. He had taxus stent in [**12-6**].
The plan was to pursue a lower INR target for anticoagulation
from 1.8 - 2.5, though this would be recalibrated to 2.0 - 3.0
as an outpatient if there was no further bleeding.
.
DM2:
The patient was continued on insulin and sliding scale.
.
