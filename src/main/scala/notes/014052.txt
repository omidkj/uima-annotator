Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with hx of CAD, past LAD occlusion with moderate RCA
disease and distal OM disease, HLD, recent admission for SBO and
?mucinous tumor of appendix, lupus anticoagulant positive, prior
CVA on coumadin presents with STEMI. He was was doing dishes at
home when felt lightheaded and slumped over. He was caught by
his wife and thinks that he was unconscious for less than 5
minutes. He notes left shoulder pain for 1 week.  None
currently. Denies CP.

325mg and Plavix 600mg. Labs notable for K 3.7, Cr 0.7, Mg 1.6,
Ca 7.8, WBC 10.3, HCT 29.8 (baseline 30.8 [**8-/2113**]), INR 2.4.  UA
was negative.
.
Went to [**Hospital1 **] and had STE in inferior leads with troponin of
44 and on catheterization had mid LAD proximal right and left
circumflex stenoses.  Proximal right lesion was thought to be
chronic.  He was not intervened upon and cardiac surgery was
consulted. By report, cardiac surgery breifly evaluated patient
in cardiac catheterization lab and it was decided he would like
not proceed with CABG.
.
On the floor the patient notes that he was hospitalized from
[**Date range (1) 91742**] at [**Hospital3 3765**] for SBO. He states that his diet
has since been advanced to regular without a problem. ROS
positive for DVT. He goes to the gym 2-3 times a week for 30-45
min with his wife and does the treadmill, bike and hand weights.
Denies any CP or dyspnea with any of these activities but notes
that his left shoulder had bothered him for approximately 1
week.

embolism, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,

MICRO/PATH:

Urine Culture [**2113-10-20**]: MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY
TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
.
MRSA Screen [**2113-10-20**]: No MRSA isolated.
.
IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
Cardiac Cath [**2113-10-20**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease with 100% mid LAD, 100%
proximal
and mid RCA, and 95% distal LCx.
2. Recommend continued medical therapy and surgical consultation
for
consideration of CABG.
3. Unsuccessful attempt at RCA PCI.
.
TTE [**2113-10-21**]: LVEF 30%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall LV systolic function appears
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior free wall, and
akinesis of the posterior wall and apex. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
