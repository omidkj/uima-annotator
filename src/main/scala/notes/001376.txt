Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Borderline tachycardia (100), regular rhythm, normal S1 +

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2100-9-28**]
FINDINGS: No previous images. There is surgical change involving
the right upper zone with extensive fibrotic scarring and some
retraction of the mediastinal contours to this side. Surgical
clips are seen. The findings are consistent with prior operative
procedure for cancer and possibly some post-radiation changes.
Nevertheless, there is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
.
Bronchoscopy prelim: no source of bleeding below the cords,
?role for ENT evaluation

Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o female with COPD, lung cancer s/p RUL excision 5 years
ago who presented with hemoptysis.
.
## Hemoptysis: pt had history of mild hemoptysis, concerning for
possibility of malignancy or possible bronchiectasis.  No
evidence of airway or hemodynamic compromise. OSH CTA [**2100-9-28**]:
No pulmonary embolism, tumor burden or infection. U/A wnl and
without evidence of pulmonary-renal syndrome. CXR showed
evidence of prior surgery in the right upper lobe with fibrosis
and retractions. Aspirin was held in setting of bleeding.  Hct
was stable throughout admission (discharge Hct 35.5).
Bronchoscopy was performed and no source of bleeding was found
in the tracheobronchial tree, and no evidence for tumor
recurrance noted.  Upper airway, or nasopharyngeal source of
bleeding could not be excluded, and patient may require
outpatient ENT evaluation at the discretion of her primary care
doctor (small amount of blood above the vocal cords suggestive
of an upper airway source of bleeding). Patient completed four
days of azithromycin for possible bronchitis while admitted, and
will complete the 5 day course on discharge. Aspirin was resumed
on discharge. Pt discharged on azithromycin, cough suppressant,
saline nasal spray. She may need ENT follow-up as an outpatient
in order to assess her upper airway, and this will be
communicated with her PCP.
.
## COPD: occasional wheezing on physical exam, without
respiratory distress.  She was maintained on home regimen of
spiriva, ipratropium, and albuterol nebulizers.
.
## HTN: stable, continued on home regimen of Diovan/HCTZ
.
## HLD: stable, continued on home regimen of Simvastatin
.
## GERD: stable, continued on home regimen of Omeprazole.
