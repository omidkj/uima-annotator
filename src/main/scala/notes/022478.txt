Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was run as a trauma stat in the [**Hospital1 18**] per ATLS
protocol. The decision was made to obtain complete CT imaging of
his head, neck, torso, and Lt femur. He was then transferred to
the trauma surgery ICU where upon lightening of sedation he was
noted to have no neurological function below the C5 level.
Despite negative CT Cspine studies, the decision was made to
obtain an MRI of this cervical spine.

His [**Hospital **] hospital course is summarized by systems:

Neuro: Patient suffered a cord contusion at C3-5 level. He was
evaluated by neurosurgery and found to be a non-operative
candidate and the decision was made to keep him in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J
cspine collar at least 6 weeks at which point an MRI will be
repeated. He gradually regained the ability to move his toes
([**3-2**]), ankles ([**1-30**]), and knees ([**1-2**]), as well as use some grasp
function of his hands bilaterally, although this exam waxes and
wanes. The patient's home Paxil was restarted upon resumption of
PO intake, but the patient refused restarting of his other
neuro/psychiatric meds (for BPD, etc.). A nicotine patch was
implemented. Trazodone was used prn for sleep

CV: The patient was hypotensive and bradycardic upon admission,
consistent with neurogenic shock. neosynephrine was used as a
pressor to increase SVR and maintain adequate BP, in addition to
an initially aggressive resuscitation period. The patient was
switched to midodrine PO and weaned off neosynephrine. He has
remained hemodynamically stable throughout his ICU course.

Resp: The patient was given a spontaneous breathing trial
multiple times over the first 72 hours of admission. Although he
was able to produce tidal volumes of >700 on his own, he
fatigued easily. The level of injury and his need for long-term
intubation led to the patient receiving a tracheostomy on
[**2138-11-6**] (trauma day 3). He remains on a PSV. He has undergone
several bronchoscopies for foul-smelling sputum in the setting
of fevers. Sputum cultures and BAL specimens, however, have not
identified a causative pathogen. Although a CT angiogram of the
chest was negative for PE at the time of admission (pt was 2
weeks postop from a Lt distal femur fracture repair and
suspicion of pulmonary embolism as mechanism of presenting chest
pain, SOB was highly suspected at time of presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**]), a CXR on [**11-4**] showed evidence of PE/infarction of the Lt
lower lobe. An IVC filter was placed on [**11-5**] to prevent further
PE in a quadriplegic patient with traumatic contraindications
for anticoagulation.

GI: the patient was gradually started on tube feeds and advanced
to goal. His abdomen was intermittently distended and standard
bowel regimens were utilized to achieve bowel movements.
Additionally, methylnaltrexone was used to stimulate bowe
