CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

EGD:
Findings:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
 Contents: Old Clotted blood was seen in the fundus. No evidence
of active bleeding seen throughout the stomach.
 Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema of the mucosa with no
bleeding was noted in the whole stomach. These findings are
compatible with gastritis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Erythema in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis


Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o with ischemic CHF EF 35%, CAD s/p CABG, afib on coumadin,
DM, CKD s/p nephrectomy here with coffee ground emesis- UGI
bleed in the setting of supratherapeutic INR 8.4. She was
transferred to the MICU from [**Hospital3 4107**].
.
1. UGIB.  While in the MICU the received a total of 3 units of
blood and 4 units of FFP and 10mg of vitamin K. Her hematocrit
increased appropriately and her INR reversed to 1.4. An EGD done
in the MICU showed old blood in the stomach with signs of
gastritis and no active bleeding. It was felt that her bleed
came from the gastritis exacerbated by the supratherapeutic INR.
 She was placed on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI in addition to sucralfate and
maalox/lidocaine for GERD symptom relief. Her HCT remained
stable for 60+ hours after EGD. H. Pylori serologies were
negative.  She was able to tolerate a full diet. She remained
asymptomatic and was felt safe to return home.

2. CAD s/p CABG. Ms. [**Known lastname 73770**] did have an isolated troponin
elevation, peaking at 0.36,  in the setting of her GIB. However,
her CK was not elevated, she showed no EKG changes, and remained
asymptomatic. Thus this was felt not to be an NSTEMI but only a
demand ischemia not requiring any non-medical intervention.
After transfer out of the MICU, she was restarted on her
metoprolol, lisinopril, aspirin, and Plavix with good effect.
Lipitor 80mg PO daily was also added to her regimen. At the time
of discharge her troponins were trending down.

3. TIA-While in hospital Ms. [**Known lastname 73770**] experienced one episode of
blank staring lasting approximately 60 seconds, witnessed, that
she states is consistent with her prior TIAs. She notes that the
last one happened approximately 1.5 years ago, prior to her R
CEA done for 70% stenosis. She was on her aspirin and Plavix at
the time and there were no focal or persistent neurologic
abnormalities noted on exam.  A carotid ultrasound showed only
60-69% stenosis on the left and no stenosis on the right. This
requires no surgical intervention but an appointment was made
for her with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], a vascular surgeon, for follow up.

4. DM 2- She was continued on her home regimen of Lantus with a
Lispro sliding scale with good effect. She was also continued on
her gabapentin for her peripheral neuropathy with no new
symptoms noted.
.
5. Systolic congestive heart failure EF 35%- Upon stabilization
of her GIB, she was restarted on her regimen of metoprolol,
lisinopril, and Torsemide with good effect and proper diuresis
after volume loading with blood products. Her HCTZ was held as
her blood pressure was not elevated above SBP of 120 while on
the floor and she was diuresing well on Torsemide alone. This
may be restarted as an outpatient if needed.
.
6. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation-After stabilization of her
GIB, Ms. [**Known lastname 73770**] was restarted on her Coumadin at a lower dose
of 2.5mg PO daily. She was set up with Bayada Nursing for 3x/wk
INR checks and alterations with a goal of INR [**2-23**]. In addition
her supratherapeutic INR may have been contributed to by her
poor PO intake. Thus, Megace was added to her medication regimen
to assist in her appetite

7. Decreased PO Intake-The patient stated that her appetite has
been decreased over the last 6 months with an involuntary weight
loss of [**11-9**] lbs. TSH was normal in [**2193-8-21**]. Age
appropriate cancer screening should be undertaken as an
outpatient. Depression may have contributed to her anorexia as
well. Again, Megace was added to her regimen and the patient was
encouraged to eat a healthy diet of low fat, low carb/sugar
meals.

8. Depression - Continued on Fluoxetine.
