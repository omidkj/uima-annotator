Admission Date:  [**2172-11-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2172-11-16**]

Date of Birth:   [**2130-4-23**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CICU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 25067**] is a 42-year-old
gentlemen with a history of cardiac risk factors only significant
for increased cholesterol and obesity, who was in his usual state
basketball that morning, which he had not done for one and a
half years, the patient experienced sudden onset of substernal
heaviness, as though, "someone was squeezing my chest."  The
pain was accompanied by some mild shortness of breath, but no
nausea, vomiting or palpitations.  After several minutes, the
sensation resolved only to recur when he again resumed playing
basketball.  Over the next 45 minutes, the patient experienced
gradual increase in the severity of the pain until it reached
[**8-4**] as if someone was punching him in the chest.  At that point,
the patient's wife insisted on calling 911 and he presented to an
outside hospital Emergency Department at [**Location (un) 1121**] [**Hospital 1281**]
Hospital where he was found to have anterolateral ST elevations
with reciprocal inferior ST depressions.  The patient was then
treated with Lopressor, aspirin, sublingual nitroglycerin and a
nitroglycerin drip which decreased the chest pain to [**5-4**].  He
was then treated with reteplase times two with subsequent
decrease in pain during the ambulance ride to the [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to [**1-5**].

At the [**Hospital6 256**], the patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a
proximal tight, ulcerated left anterior descending artery lesion
which was stented with subsequent resolution of ST elevations in
the anterolateral leads. There was a distal (apical) LAD total
occlusion which was felt to be due to embolized thrombus from
the proximal lesion, and which was not treated due to the
small caliber of the vessel.  The patient was then transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit for observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  None.  The patient had previously been prescribed
Lipitor, but he was not currently taking Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married with children.  No alcohol, tobacco
or drug use.  He sells produce for a living.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival to the Coronary Care Unit,
the patient had the following vital signs:  Temperature 99.2.
Pulmonary artery pressure 35/17 with a mean of 25.  Systolic
blood pressure 132/89 diastolic.  Heart rate was 82 and
regular.  He was breathing 20 and saturating 99% on two
liters.  General:  Patient was lying in bed in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic, anicteric.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to
light.  Oropharynx clear and moist.  Neck:  Supple, no
jugular venous distention was notable, but is was likely
elevated.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal
bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  There was
no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurological:  He was alert
and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Motor sensory intact bilaterally of the upper
extremities, lower extremities.  He is guaiac negative.

LABORATORIES:  The patient had the following laboratories
from the outside hospital:  White blood cell count 11.9,
hematocrit 45.8, platelet count 274,000, CK-MB of 4, MB
percentage of 2.  On cardiac catheterization here, the
patient showed right atrial pressure of 24, 23 and 20 mean.
Pulmonary artery pressure of 56, 36 with 44 mean.  Pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure 43,49,33 mean.  Pulmonary artery
saturation was 70%.  The patient had a peak CK of 3500.  He had
triglycerides of 76, HDL 54, LDL of 138.  He had a signal
averaged electrocardiogram prior to discharge, which was
negative.  His electrocardiogram demonstrated normal sinus rhythm
at 87 initially (at the outside hospital) with ST elevations in
V1 through V4.  He ST depressions in II, III and aVF.  He also
had [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in I and aVL.

On the day of discharge, the patient had the following
laboratory values:  CK of 1463, MB of 41 and an index of 2.1.
He had blood cultures times two and urine cultures from the
[**12-17**], which were negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular:  As previously mentioned, the patient had
an ulcerated severe proximal LAD lesion which was treated
with angioplasty and stenting.  He also had elevated pulmonary
capillary wedge pressures at the time of catheterization.  He was
admitted to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit. For the duration of
his hospital stay, the patient remained chest pain free.  He
denied any shortness of breath or palpitations.  He did have
within 24 hours of stenting some runs of idioventricular rhythms
consistent with reperfusion.  He was treated conservatively
with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and gentle diuresis for
fluid overload.  He was also started on Plavix and treated
with heparin for undetermined cardiac systolic function
pending an echocardiogram.  He was also treated with aspirin.
On the afternoon of discharge, we are waiting for the final
echocardiogram results to determine the patient's need for
risk stratification for arrhythmias and for anticoagulation
for a possible akinesis of the apex of the heart and to
determine the patient's final ejection fraction.

2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient spiked a fever two days
following his admission to 101.5.  Blood cultures and urine
cultures were drawn and the results were negative at the time
of discharge and the patient remained afebrile and clinically
well.  He was not treated with any antibiotics.

3.  Endocrine:  The patient denies history of diabetes,
however, there is diabetes in the family.  His blood sugars
were slightly elevated to the 150s through his hospital stay
and it is quite possible the patient has diabetes mellitus.
The patient should follow-up with primary care physician for
[**Name Initial (PRE) **] glucose tolerance test.

4.  Hypercholesterolemia:  The patient was demonstrated to
have elevated LDL and should be continually treated with a
statin [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition at
discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post anterior myocardial infarction.
2.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to the left anterior descending artery for two
ulcerative lesions.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Possible diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged on the
following medications:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
2.  Lisinopril 10 mg po q.d.
3.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d. times 12 months.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.
5.  Metoprolol 15 mg po b.i.d.
6.  It is also possible that the patient will be discharged
on Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. and warfarin 5 mg po
q.h.s. depending on the results of the echocardiogram which
are pending.  The final determination for these
anti-coagulants will be made when the results of the
echocardiogram are available.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to call Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 285**] for follow-up appointment within
one week of discharge.  He indicated that he would do so and
the patient is also to call his primary care physician for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702**] appointment within one week of discharge for a
glucose tolerance test.  He indicated that he would do this
as well.
