HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48 year-old man
with a history of CREST syndrome times 25 years and a more
recent history of dyspnea on exertion worsening over the past
several months.  The patient was admitted to the hospital in
late [**2139-2-21**] and diagnosed with severe pulmonary
hypertension by echocardiogram and right heart
catheterization, which showed a pulmonary artery pressure of
86 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19.  The
patient was discharged on [**3-31**] on Bosentan 62.5 mg twice
a day as well as Lasix.  He took the Bosentan for a month
without relief, then stopped for ten days due to loss of
insurance and then restarted at 125 mg twice a day.  The
patient notes that he did not fill his Lasix prescription
following the [**Month (only) 958**] discharge and did not check his daily
weights.  Over several days after restarting the Bosentan the
patient noted increasing dyspnea on exertion, shortness of
breath, bilateral peripheral lower extremity edema,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and increasing orthopnea.  He
was referred to the Emergency Department where he was
admitted for the initiation of continuous infusion Flolan
treatment, which had previously been planned for a week after
the time of his deterioration.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At the time of admission revealed severe
right digital pain in the right upper extremity secondary to
Raynaud's.  The patient denies fevers or chills, nausea and
vomiting, chest pain, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits,
melena or bright red blood per rectum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  CREST syndrome diagnosed 25 years ago.  The patient has a
history of digital ulcers secondary to Raynaud's phenomenon
and is status post right laparoscopic sympathectomy in
[**2138-9-21**] without symptomatic relief.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease with esophageal
stricture.
3.  Pulmonary hypertension first noted on echocardiogram in
[**2135**] and recently diagnosed as described in the history of
present illness.  The patient is on 4 liters of home O2.
4.  Mild restrictive lung disease with a decreased DLCO.
5.  History of upper gastrointestinal bleed.
6.  Status post left hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  The patient notes nausea and vomiting with
morphine and codeine and itching with Percocet.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE FLOOR:  Vital signs
temperature 98.9.  Pulse 73.  Blood pressure 108/48.
Respirations 15.  O2 sat 92% on room air.  The patient was
alert and oriented times three and complaining of digital
pain.  He was in no acute distress.  The pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.
His mucous membranes are moist with telangiectasias.  There
was no cervical lymphadenopathy.  The patient did have
jugulovenous distention to about 16 cm.  Lung examination
revealed diffuse mild crackles throughout bilaterally with
resonant percussion.  Heart examination showed a regular rate
and rhythm with a normal S1 and a split S2 with a loud P2.
There was also a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur heard
best at the left upper sternal border.  Extremity examination
revealed no clubbing or cyanosis.  The patient did have 1+
edema in the lower extremities bilaterally to the mid calf
level.  The calves were discolored with multiple brownish red
indurated nodular lesions, which were nontender.  The upper
extremities had significant digital ulceration on digits one
through four of the right hand.  Neurological examination was
notable for intact cranial nerves and intact strength and
sensation in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 6.7,
hematocrit 34.9, platelet count 211.  Electrolytes sodium
139, potassium 4.0, chloride 103, bicarbonate 25, BUN 18 and
creatinine 1.2 with a glucose of 94.

Admission electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, T
wave inversion in 1, 2, and 3 with poor R wave progression
and T wave inversion in V1 through V5.  There were also new T
wave inversions in 2, 3 and AVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU on [**5-26**].  He was ruled out for myocardial infarction and diuresed
with Lasix.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed and the Flolan
was started on [**5-27**].  A Hickman catheter was placed by
general surgery on [**5-29**] and the patient was called out of
the MICU to the medical floor.  The Flolan was titrated to 9
nanograms per kilogram per minute with moderate flushing,
headache and nausea.  These side effects were treated with
Compazine and Vicodin.  A Flolan dose of 10 nanograms per
kilogram per minute was attempted on [**6-1**], but was
decreased back to 9 nanograms per kilogram per minute due to
hypotension to 90/45.  The patient did note improvement in
his dyspnea on exertion in the days following the Flolan
initiation.  An outside agency provided Flolan teaching for
the patient's sister who will prepare the Flolan at home.  A
Flolan nurse will visit the home daily in the week following
discharge.

Also during this admission pain service was consulted
regarding the patient's digital ulcer pain.  The pain was
treated with Oxycontin with Vicodin for breakthrough.
Oxycontin was increased from 30 b.i.d. to 30 t.i.d. on [**6-1**], but was changed to 40 b.i.d. on [**6-4**] secondary to
increased sedation.  In addition, on [**6-3**] the patient
complained of severe throat pain and pharyngeal edema and
exudate were noted on examination.  A culture was sent and
Amoxicillin was started for a presumed strep throat.  The
patient was discharged to home in stable condition.
