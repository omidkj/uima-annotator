Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old male
with end stage insulin dependent diabetes mellitus with
triopathy who presents after complaints of progressive
shortness of breath with sudden onset, developing on [**2121-1-19**].
He ultimately came to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Room on [**2121-1-20**] where work-up included a
chest x-ray that showed cardiomegaly, cephalization, vascular
engorgement with bilateral CT angle blunting consistent with
pulmonary edema.  Ultimately given this presentation, he was
admitted to the C-Med service where he was put on a rule out
protocol.  His troponin I did peak at 37.  His CKs, however,
remained negative.  His preoperative hematocrit was noted to
be 28 with platelet count of 152,000 and a white blood cell
count of 11,000.  His BUN and creatinine were 37 and 1.4 with
baseline creatinine of 1.3 to 1.5.  Cardiac catheterization
that was carried out on [**2121-1-20**] revealed trace MR, left
ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.  The left main coronary
artery was non diseased, however, the LAD had diffuse disease
with a 70% mid LAD lesion and another serial lesion on the
LAD at 80% distally.  The left circ at the level of the OM1
had a 95% stenosis at the origin and the right coronary
artery was diffusely diseased with 90% distal stenosis with
thrombus.  Given his significant three vessel coronary artery
disease and mild to moderate systolic dysfunction, he was
admitted to the C-Med service, placed on telemetry, given
diuresis and beta blockade and ultimately referred to the
cardiothoracic surgery service of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

The patient was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2121-1-21**].  At this
time he was already on Heparin for the positive troponin and
three vessel disease.  He was pain free at that time.  His
JVD and pulmonary compromise with pulmonary edema were
resolving.  He was transfused for a hematocrit of 24 on
hospital day #2 and given one unit of packed cells followed
by Lasix.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His other preoperative history
included a past medical history of insulin dependent diabetes
with peripheral neuropathy, questionable history of
gastroparesis.  He has severe peripheral vascular disease. He
has chronic lower extremity leg ulcers on the left.  He has
had coronary artery disease, hypertension, degenerative joint
disease including bilateral hips.  He has history of CHF, has
had a gunshot wound in the past.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for right below the knee
amputation as well as a left transmetatarsal amputation.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for previous tobacco history,
greater than 30 pack year as well as he lives alone and is a
[**Country 3992**] veteran.  His physical activity at baseline is
wheelchair bound.  He has had no history of TIA, CVA or GI
bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ultimately Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the patient was
appropriate to go to the OR.  He went for a three vessel
coronary artery bypass graft on [**2121-1-22**].  Grafts included a
LIMA to the LAD, a left saphenous vein graft to the OM1 and a
left saphenous vein graft to the PDA.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well.  Intraoperative TEE revealed an ejection
fraction of 30-40%.  Post-operatively out of the OR he was
maintained on Epinephrine, Aprotinin, Levophed, an insulin
drip and Propofol for sedation.  He was brought to the
cardiac surgical care recovery unit where his postoperative
labs were noted to have a hematocrit of 30, normal
coagulation parameters, INR of 1.2, PTT 33, potassium was
noted to be 4.4, BUN and creatinine at this time were 63 and
1.5.  He was started on Levaquin and Flagyl not only to cover
his lower extremity leg ulcers, but also to cover some
viscous pulmonary secretions that were noted.  He was
extubated on postoperative day #1 and was maintained on a non
rebreather.  He was satting at 93% with gases of 7.26, 63,
167, 31 and 0.  Given the tenuous nature of his gases, he had
serial ABGs followed on postoperative day #1, was given
aggressive pulmonary toilet.  He was started with diuresis.
His Aspirin was started and his Neo-Synephrine was weaned.
His insulin drip was maintained at 5 units per hour and he
was normoglycemic.  By postoperative day #2 the patient
remained in the cardiac surgical care recovery unit.  He was
on Levaquin and Flagyl, his perioperative Vancomycin dose was
finished at his third dose, insulin drip was titrated to 6
units to maintain normoglycemia.  He was started on
prophylaxis with Zantac as well as stool softeners with
Colace.  His oral diet was a diabetic [**Doctor First Name **], 1800 kilocalories
with cardiac diet as well.  His day #2 labs included a
hematocrit of 23 for which he was ultimately transfused two
units.  This was thought to be secondary to small oozing that
was in his chest tube.  BUN and creatinine were 69 and 1.8.
After his volume being repleted as well as his transfusion
being completed, he was continued on progressive pulmonary
toilet and diuresis.  By postoperative day #3 the patient was
deemed appropriate for discharge to the floor.  He was
maintained on chest tube suction because of high chest tube
output, his sanguineous discharges on the first two days
changed to more serosanguineous and his hematocrit was stable
at 30 on postoperative day #3.  BUN and creatinine were noted
to be 71 and 1.9.  He was changed to a q day Lasix regimen
instead of [**Hospital1 **] and Lopressor was started as well as adding on
a full dose Aspirin.  [**Last Name (un) **] consultation was obtained for
assistance with the patient's diabetic management.  He was
tolerating his diet although he was complaining at this time
of intermittent regurgitation.  This was felt to be due
secondary to his probable underlying gastroparesis and
autonomic neuropathy from his end stage diabetes.
Consequently the patient was started on Reglan which had
satisfactory results and eliminated the majority of the
patient's complaints of nausea and regurgitation.  Of note,
on postoperative day #3 the patient's Foley was removed,
however, he failed to void in 9 hours post Foley removal and
after attempts by the house officer and nursing staff to
insert a Foley catheter, these failed, urology consultation
was obtained.  The patient had his catheter inserted by the
urology service who felt that he probably failed to void
secondary to retention issues of the post-operative state
with narcotic use and his autonomic neuropathy and perhaps
small degree of benign prostatic hypertrophy.  FOley was
instructed to stay in until which time the chest tube is
removed so that once his pain requirements became less he
would use less narcotic and as a consequence have less
urinary sphincter tone.  By postoperative day #4 the patient
was undergoing [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] transfers with physical therapy, was out
of bed to a chair, tolerating it well.   He was noted to go
into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response to
the 110's.  This was easily treated and controlled with
Lopressor and he was started on Amiodarone, converted to
normal sinus rhythm after approximately 12 hours of therapy.
By postoperative day #5 the patient was in sinus rhythm, was
afebrile, tolerating his diet without complaints.  He had a
Foley catheter and chest tube at this time.  By postoperative
day #6 his chest tubes were removed, chest x-ray showed a
small left effusion with pneumothorax, normal cardiac
silhouette, no focal infiltrate was identified.  He
additionally had Foley catheter removed at midnight prior to
discharge.  Labs prior to discharge were notable for
hematocrit of 35, BUN and creatinine of 64 and 1.6.  His exam
was notable for temperature of 98.3, pressure of 90/50, pulse
rate of 64 and sinus.  On exam he has a stable sternum with
staples in place, no erythema or drainage.  Heart was regular
with no murmur or rub or gallop.  Lungs with decreased breath
sounds at the bases with crackles bilaterally.  Left lower
extremity was no
