Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
56 y/o M with alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p orthotopic liver
[**First Name3 (LF) **] [**2109-5-28**], and on sirolimus and post-[**Year (4 digits) **]
course complicated by diarrhea, malnutrition and recurrent MDR
Pseudomonas pneumonias (most recently [**2111-9-28**]) now
transferred from OSH intubated with HCAP complicated by
respiratory failure. He had recently been discharged from rehab
to home [**11-24**]. But 3 days PTA, he reported worsening SOB and
productive cough and admitted to NWH where he was found to be in
hypoxic respiratory failure with acidosis and intubated. He was
treated with vanco and imipenem initially and subsequently
amikacin was added. His sputum cx revealed moderate pseudomonas
and staph. He was also received 1 unit PRBCs for anemia and HCT
drop 33->23 but was guaiac negative.
.
At present patient just got extubated therefore did not take
detailed history sedated and therefore unable to provide
history. His rapamycin was at 3.0 mg daily and more recently his
levels were stable with last level being at range (9) on [**2111-12-16**]. His recent doppler US on [**12-21**] was unremarkable.

Past Medical History:
- Alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p orthotopic Liver [**Month/Year (2) **] [**2109-6-6**],
[**2109-6-23**] exploration for hematoma and fluid collection, last
liver biopsy [**2111-12-18**] with no acute cellular rejection but
nonspecific findings and marked iron deposition
- H/o malnutrition on TFs
- Prior ESLD c/b ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, grade II
esophageal varices and portal gastropathy, candidal and
bacterial (SBP) peritonitis Post-[**Month/Day/Year **] course has been
complicated by diarrhea and malnutrition s/p extensive workup
that has not found a cause.
This diarrhea is controlled with cholestyramine, Imodium,
tincture of opium, and he has [**12-31**] bowel movements a day.
- Recurrent UTIs: Most recent cultures ([**2110-5-7**]) grew pan
sensitive kleb pnemonia and corynebacterium, but in the past has
grown out resistant strains of pseudomonas sensitive only to
meropenem, amikacin.
- History of Torsades while on ciprofloxacin.
- Of note: recent hospitalization [**4-4**] w/ multiple episodes of

VT/torsades s/p magnesium & cardioversion x2. At that time
thought [**12-30**] to meds (Reglan, celexa, lyrica and Bactrim) and
contribution from congenital long QTc. QTc was 499-536 despite
holding meds and given daily magnesium and potassium.
- Cardiology evaluated him ad thought not a candidate at that
time for implantable device given recent infections. Followed as
outpatient by cardiology thought pt stress cardiomyopathy,
recommended avoiding zofran.
- Anemia with baseline Hct 27-30
- Hydroureteroephrosis/Urinary retention: Seen by [**Month/Day (2) **] as
outpatient. Most recent OMR note: secondary to recurrent
infections and that intermittent catheterization led to
hydronephrosis. Managed w/ indwelling foley.
- Colorectal cancer (stage unknown) s/p colectomy in [**11/2108**]
- Cervical stenosis
- History of C Diff colitis
- History of depression
- BPH
- Chronic pancytopenia
- Recurrent PsA:[**2111-10-17**] [**Hospital1 18**] culture data for Pseudomonas
([**Last Name (un) **] to amikacin, intermediate to cefepime, ceftaz, meropenem,
resistant to cipro, gentamycin, zosyn, tobramycin&#8206;) as
well as culture data from [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 8**] [**11-11**] (Pseudomonas
S to Amikacin, I to Meropenem, R to Cefepime, Ceftaz, Cipro,
Gent, Imi, Levoflox, Zosyn, and Tobra)
.
