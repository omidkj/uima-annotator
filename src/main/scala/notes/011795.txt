Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
hyponatremia, decreased mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripherally inserted central catheter

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with H/o hypothyroid  presents after fall.  Recently
admitted for fall and pain control on [**9-6**], noted to have
low Na (129) at the time, she then returned with altered mental
status in setting of hyponatremia (112).  Initially attempted
correction with normal saline, but she became volume overloaded
w/ pulmonary edema [**12-21**] diastolic dysfunction.  Then, attempted
diuresis caused bradycardia and hypotension.  She was
transferred to MICU for further stabilization, and did well
subsequently with minimal intervention - fluid restriction and
small amount of hypertonic saline, which was discontinued.  She
was then transferred to the floor for further titration of pain
regimen and treatment of L1 fracture.
<BR>
On evaluation of her back, an MR of the L-Spine revealed acute
compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50%
narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal, moderate
spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative
changes. Moderate-to-severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1
level secondary to disc degenerative changes and facet
degeneration.
<BR>
Pt was initially placed on a fentanyl patch (25mcg) in MICU for
pain control.
<BR>
On transfer, pt was denying any pain, chest discomfort or
shortness of breath

MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-8-4**] 12:11 PM
Acute compression fracture of L1 vertebra with retropulsion and
50% narrowing of central portion of the spinal canal. Moderate
spinal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc and facet degenerative
changes. Moderate- to-severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1
level secondary to disc degenerative changes and facet
degeneration.

ECHO Study Date of [**2187-8-4**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
markedly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
3.While difficult to assess, the right ventricular cavity is
probably mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
9.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F Mitral regurg, probable diastolic dysfunction intially
admitted with delirium probably secondary to hyponatremia, poor
PO intake, and severe pain [**12-21**] L1 compression fracture.  In
detail:

1. Hyponatremia: Pt. initially presented with Na of 112.  She
was given NS which precipitated volume overload and pulmonary
edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and mitral
regurgitation. She subsequently had an episode of hypotension
[**12-21**] overdiuresis and was transferred to the ICU.  Volume was
allowed to reequilibrate, and the patient's sodium improved with
fluid restriction and a small amount of hypertonic saline.  This
was therefore thought to be as a result of combination SIADH as
well as hypovolemic hyponatremia.

2. Compression fracture: An MRI showed a compression fracture of
the L1 vertebra with retropulsion and 50% narrowing of central
portion of the spinal canal, moderate spinal stenosis at L4-5
level due to disc and facet degenerative changes. She may be a
candidate for future kyphoplasty.  For the time being she has
been fitted with a TLSO brace. Her pain regimen was tailored
during her stay. Pt. was able to ambulate with PT.

3. Falls: We reduced the patients narcotics dose and she was
evaluated by PT.  She continued her rehabilitation at the [**Hospital1 100**]
House.

4. Heart failure: The patient's pulmonary edema is resolving.
Her ECHO reveals a   EF55% 2+TR, 2+MR, RV depressed, Pulm
Regurg, mod PA HTN. <BR>. She was started on Lisinopril and
continued on her metoprolol and ASA.

5. Pain Control: for the patient's compression fracture, Mrs. [**Known lastname 98082**] pain was controlled with a Lidocaine patch, oxycodone
sustained release 10mg q12, OxycodONE liquid 2.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN
pain.  We stopped her fentanyl patch (25mcg) as it caused the
patient to become confused.  Narcotics should be used very
carefully in this patient as she tends to become confused and is
susceptible to falls.

6. ? Pneumonia: As pt became hypoxic in the setting of mental
status changes shortly after admission, she was treated
empirically with a course of levofloxacin.  However, she was
never febrile and did not produce sputum, so antibiotics were
discontinued at the time of discharge.
