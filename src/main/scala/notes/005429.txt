HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female
with a history of mitral regurgitation, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] Cardiology from [**Hospital6 33**] for
cardiac catheterization after new onset atrial fibrillation,
low ejection fraction and severe mitral regurgitation.  The
patient presented to her primary care physician's office
complaining of shortness of breath on [**2193-6-7**] when she
was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation with a
ventricular rate to the 150s.  She was sent to [**Hospital6 3426**] by ambulance where she was rate controlled with
Diltiazem and anticoagulated.  Electrocardiogram performed at
[**Hospital6 33**] showed a decreased left ventricular
ejection fraction to 25% (prior ejection fraction 60% in
[**2191-7-7**]).  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] on [**6-12**] for cardiac catheterization.

The patient's anticoagulation was reversed and she underwent
cardiac catheterization on [**6-17**] which showed no flow
limiting disease in the coronary arteries.  She had moderate
to severe mitral regurgitation with mitral valve prolapse,
moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
normal biventricular diastolic function, heavy mitral annular
calcification and an ejection fraction of 35%.
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted for a potential mitral
valve replacement surgery for this patient.  The patient
underwent transesophageal echocardiogram and cardioversion on
[**6-18**] with Amiodarone loading.  She was anticoagulated after
cardioversion.  On [**6-19**], the patient was found to have a 10
point hematocrit drop with left lower quadrant abdominal
pain.  Computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed a
large acute anterior abdominal wall hematoma extending from
the left rectus abdominis muscle with extension within the
retroperitoneal space bilaterally.  The patient was taken off
of heparin and a surgical consult was obtained.  Throughout
the day on [**6-19**], the patient had episodes of hypotension
with systolic blood pressures into the 70s and was therefore
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Upon arrival
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient's systolic
blood pressure was 110 and she appeared comfortable and
stable.  The patient receive 2 units of packed red blood
cells and her hematocrit was stable on a repeated hematocrit
checks.  She was called out to the Medical Floor to the Acove
Service on [**2193-6-20**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs reveal the patient is
afebrile, blood pressure is 120/70, pulse 80, respirations
18, weight 72.6 kg.  In general, comfortable-appearing female
in no apparent distress, alert and oriented times three.
Cardiovascular, irregularly irregular rate and rhythm, S1 and

left lower sternal border.  Jugulovenous pressure 8 to 9 cm,
no carotid bruits.  Pulmonary:  Bibasilar crackles.  Abdomen:
Soft, nondistended, nontender.  Bowel sounds present.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities, 1+ pitting edema,
bilaterally with 2+ pulses peripherally.  Neurologic, alert
and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact.  Strength 5/5 in upper and lower extremities
bilaterally.  Normal finger-to-nose and rapid alternating
movements.  Gait is slow but steady.  Deep tendon reflexes,

LABORATORY DATA:  Outside hospital laboratory data from [**6-8**]
- Complete blood count, white blood cell count 5.0,
hematocrit 37.2, platelets 187.  [**6-11**], PT 24.4, INR 3.0, PTT
35.4.  Sodium 135, potassium 3.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate
19, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9, glucose 110, calcium 9.6, protein
6.7, albumin 4.5, TSH 3.2, alkaline phosphatase 75, LDL to
HDL ratio of 2.49, LDL 40, HDL 37, triglycerides 76,
cholesterol 92.  Electrocardiogram [**6-8**], atrial fibrillation
with rate 100 beats/minute, diffuse T wave abnormalities.
Electrocardiogram [**6-13**], atrial fibrillation with left
ventricular hypertrophy, nonspecific interventricular
conduction delay, ST-T segment abnormalities consistent with
left ventricular hypertrophy.  Echocardiogram [**2193-6-13**],
severely depressed left ventricular systolic function with
global hypokinesis.  Moderate to severe 3+ mitral
regurgitation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The majority of the hospital course is as
noted in the history of present illness.  On [**6-20**], the
patient was transferred to the Acove Service.  The patient
experienced no further episodes of bleeding and maintained a
stable hematocrit.

Cardiovascular - Her cardiac medications were optimized
although she transiently did not receive beta blockers and
Ace inhibitors secondary to low systolic blood pressures
(approximately 100).  She was started on Digoxin for her
cardiomyopathy.  At the time of discharge her rhythm was
atrial fibrillation which was rate-controlled.  The patient
has been seen by Cardiothoracic Surgery and is under
consideration at the time of this dictation for mitral valve
repair.

Hematologic - The patient was maintained on intravenous
heparin with PTT goals in the 50s to 60s.  She was started on
Coumadin and intravenous heparin is continued pending a
therapeutic INR.  At the time of this dictation, at discharge
the patient's INR is 1.3 and she is taking a Coumadin dose of
5 mg daily.  She continues to be on intravenous heparin until
her INR becomes therapeutic (between 2 and 3).

Hematoma - The hematoma remained clinically stable throughout
the hospitalization.  At discharge the patient had a stable
hematocrit of 31.9.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will be discharged on [**6-30**],
to [**Hospital1 1872**] Rehabilitation.
