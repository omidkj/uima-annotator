History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 64310**] is a 51 year old female with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis
and depression who was transferred from an OSH after presenting
with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever to 103 at home. She
reports that she has had a [**3-6**] week prodrome of sorethroat,
non-productive cough, myalgias, and headache that has worsened
over the past few days for which she presented to an OSH last
night.  Her OSH course was notable for a CXR that, per report,
was notable for bilateral pleural effusions/consolidations,
acute renal failure with a creatinine of 3.1, a leukocytosis of
20, and hyponatremia of 128.  She was treated with ceftriaxone 2
grams IV and azithromycin 500 mg IV. Her OSH course was also
complicated by intermitent hypotension requiring peripheral
dopamine.
.
Of note, the patient reports that she received seasonal and H1N1
influenza vaccines this year.  Per report, the patient did not
receive a influenza swab or oseltamavir at the OSH. On transfer,
the patient was reported to have a SaO2 of 93% on 6L face mask.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is in respiratory distress,
tachypneic to mid-30s with an SaO2 of 88% on 15L face mask
increased to 95% NRB. She continues to complain of dyspnea and
cough, as well as increased abdominal girth.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chest pain, palpitations, n/v/d, constipation.

4. Mild splenomegaly.
5. Small amount of ascites but no safe pocket was located to
mark for a
paracentesis to be performed by the clinical staff.
.
CXR [**1-5**]:
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Abnormal ventilation pattern.

Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2160-1-3**].

The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The right internal
jugular line tip
is at the cavoatrial junction. The NG tube tip is in the
stomach.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette overall is unchanged, but there is
slight
dilatation of the mediastinum that in comparison with worsening
of pulmonary
edema and worsening of left lower lobe consolidation, might be
consistent with
pulmonary edema superimposed on worsening left lower lobe
pneumonia. There is
no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
************
Patient was made CMO, family at bedside. Pain control provided.
Patient extubated. Patient expired on [**2160-1-6**].
************
Assessment and Plan: Ms. [**Known lastname 64310**] is a 51 year old female with
MELD 29HCV cirrhosis who was transferred from an OSH after
presenting with cough, HA, encephalopathy, and fever for 3 days
with a hospital course complicated by hypotension requiring
peripheral dopamine and hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Given CXR demonstrating
bilateraly patchy infiltrates as well as her history of cough,
fever, and sore throat for 2-3 weeks, symptoms are concerning
either for influenza or a post-influenza bacterial pneumonia.
She currently meets criteria for ARDS with a P:F <100, bilateral
infiltrates, and no CHF. Other potential etiologies include IIPs
including AEP and AIP, although less likely in setting of viral
prodrome.
- Ventilate with volume-cycled AC at ARDSnet settings.
- Titrate to FiO2 and PEEP by ABG
- Sputum culture
- Bronch and BAL
- Vanco and pip/tazo for empiric HAP pneumonia given unclear
history of antibiotics and recent admissions, as well as the
fact that the patient is a hospital SW.  In addition, given
suspicion for post-influenza pneumonia, S.aureus is also a
concern. Will also treat with ciprofloxacin for atypical and GNR
coverage.
- Tamiflu at 75 mg po bid dosing given renal failure
- Influenza swab
.
# Severe sepsis: Hypoxia and hypotension concerning for
infectious process with criteria sufficient for SIRS/sepsis
given leukocytosis and tachypnea.  Potential infectious sources
include bacterial pneumonia or influenza as above. Alternative
infectious sources include SBP or urosepsis.
- Pan-culture including blood, urine, sputum, influenza sputum.
Consider diagnostic paracentesis if U/S demonstrates ascites.
- Tamiflu and antimicrobials as above.
- Monitor UOP, lactate for signs of end organ damage.
Vasopressors and IVF for volume rescucitation as necessary.
- Will also do a cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out
hepatoadrenal syndrome.
.
# Acute renal failure: Differential includes pre-renal azotemia,
ATN, or HRS.  Given hypotension, likely secondary to inadequate
perfusion.
- Trend lytes, UOP
- Urine lytes and eos.
- Volume rescucitation as above.
.
# Liver disease: Patient with MELD 29 HCV cirrhosis with acute
decompensation, likely in setting of sepsis and ARDS.
- Consult hepatology
- Patient is not currently on lactulose and [**Last Name (LF) 64311**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] hold
off for now pending hepatology evaluation.
.
# Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia in setting of SIRS.
- Trend serum sodium
.
# Thrombocytopenia/anemia/coagulopathy: Patient with
thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy.  Chronic
thrombocytopenia likely secondary to portal hypertension and
splenic sequestration, although current platelet count worse
that baseline. Coagulopathy and anemia could also be secondary
to worsening HCV cirrhosis, although DIC is also a potential
etiology.  Anemia could also be secondary to bleeding.
- Trend platelets, transfuse for plt<10 or <50 if signs of
bleeding.
- DIC and hemolysis labs.
- Guaiac stools, OGT suctioning to assess for blood
.
# Leukocytosis: Likely due to infectious process.
- Trend WBC
.
FEN: NPO, replete as necessary, IVF as above.
