CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Direct admission for deep venous thrombosis
from radiology.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year-old male with
extensive recent medical history began with coronary artery
bypass graft for coronary artery disease in [**2187-1-18**],
discharged and then readmitted on [**2187-2-27**] for shortness of
breath.  He was subsequently found to have a hemothorax,
gastrointestinal bleed and acute renal failure.  A chest tube
was placed and esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed, which
showed a duodenal nonbleeding ulcer.  His Plavix was held and
his aspirin was held as well and was started on a high dose
PPI and transfused for a low hematocrit.  During his
hospitalization a right subclavian line was readmitted on
[**3-5**] for right arm swelling with a subclavian deep venous
thrombosis.  He was started on heparin and again had an upper
gastrointestinal bleed described as severe requiring multiple
transfusions and a MICU stay.  He was discharged on the [**2-11**] and followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after this who felt
that his right leg was a bit swollen suggested an ultrasound
evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.  On the day of
admission the patient was at ultrasound and was diagnosed
with a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and was
told to go to the [**Hospital1 69**] for a
direct admit.  The patient reports that since his last
discharge he has not been able to ambulate as well, because
limited by shortness of breath, but not leg pain.  He has not
experienced any angina nor orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, but sits up and sleeps due to swelling in his upper
and lower extremities.  He has no history of coagulopathies
or hypercoagulable studies.  No recent travel.  No extended
sitting at home other then when he is resting for his leg
swelling.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives at home with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 97.6.  150/82.  56, 20,
94% on room air.  General, he is sitting upright in no acute
distress.  Appeared comfortable and slightly anxious.  HEENT
examination pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate and rhythm.  No rubs
or gallops.  2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur most likely
mitral regurgitation without any JVD.  Pulmonary examination
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  Crackles
in the left mid lung field.  No wheezes or rhonchi.
Gastrointestinal examination good bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  He was guaiac
positive. Extremities he had 1+ pitting edema in the right
upper extremity and 2+ radial pulses bilaterally.  He had 2+
pitting edema on the left lower extremity bilaterally and 2+
dorsalis pedis pulses.  No cords or [**Last Name (un) 4709**] signs were
elicited.

STUDIES:  Ultrasound examination LENI showed a right lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis at the superficial femoral
vein.  A repeat ultrasound of the cadaveric renal transplant
showed increased __________ ________, but no acute change
from previous studies.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with
a +1 mild effusions, some cephalization.  Electrocardiogram
within normal limits.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 8.1, hematocrit 29.5,
platelets 299, sodium 139, potassium 3.4, chloride 104,
bicarb 22, BUN 82, creatinine 3.9, glucose 153, PT 12.2, PTT
28.8, INR 1.0.  Urinalysis within normal limits.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  This is a 63 year-old gentleman with a
history of deep venous thrombosis in the right upper
extremity who presented with a right lower extremity deep
venous thrombosis.

1.  Recurrent deep venous thrombosis:  Given his recurrent
deep venous thrombosis and absent _______________ coagulation
given gastrointestinal bleed, we held off on anticoagulation
with Warfarin, suggested starting heparin without bolus, but
also considered placing IVC filter, however, given the
cadaveric transplant and the increase in creatinine
considered a different approach with IVC and given the fear
of retrograde thrombosis and alternative to intravenous
contrast.

2.  Gastrointestinal bleed, we consulted gastrointestinal
with regards to whether or not this person needed an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  A central line was placed and he
was typed and screened for possible future transfusions.  His
Lasix was held given his renal transplant and increased
creatinine.  He was continued on his Prednisone and
Cyclosporin.

3.  Shortness of breath:  The patient did not report any
recurrence of his angina, however, recent hemothorax, we
checked x-ray, which was normal.  Most likely due to mild
congestion.  We diuresed gently after assessing renal
function.  He was well controlled on his current hypertensive
medications.  Will continue those throughout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the following day after admission
heparin was initially held given history of GI bleed and a
question of whether or not there was a true deep venous
thrombosis.  Reassessment by radiology confirmed original
read that the ultrasound was of good quality and there in
fact was a right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  We
rediscussed with GI who said that they would like to scope
him before we started heparin.  Rescoping showed gastritis in
the fundus of the stomach and also in the proximal folds of
the duodenum.  He was started on heparin without any bolus
with a goal PT of 50 to 70.  We discussed an IVC filter with
Interventional radiology and increased creatinine with
respect to his renal transplant was also discussed with them
and in light of this we started a _______________ cystine
protocol over the weekend given his rise in creatinine.
Throughout the weekend the patient did well.  His hematocrit
slowly increased from 31.5 to 29.5 and then he went down to
26.6.  He received a unit of packed red blood cells and
bumped his hematocrit up to 30.5.  On Monday as said before
hematocrit remained stable over the weekend in the low 30s
until [**Last Name (un) 1017**] night when it was measured to be 24.3 and then
down to 29.9.  Heparin was stopped and he was given 2 units
of packed red blood cells and was scoped by GI Monday
morning.  This showed an ulcer in the bulb with a visible
vessel.  This was injected and treated thermally.  On Monday
morning he again had large maroon stools and so an IVC filter
was felt to be the best option for this gentleman in light of
his risk for continued anticoagulation.  Cyclosporin
measurement at that time showed a therapeutic 133, however,
he was decreased to 75 b.i.d. in light of his creatinine of
3.9.  In the afternoon he was transferred to the MICU for
closer management of hematocrit and gastrointestinal bleed.
A Foley was placed over the weekend.

On Tuesday [**2187-3-27**] he was called out from the MICU and
hematocrit was 28.2.  It rose to 30.3 and then to 32.2 with a
total of 9 units of packed red blood cells.  He continued to
have melena though decreased from previous days.  His
creatinine decreased from 3.5 to 3.2 with placement of a
Foley.  On Wednesday [**2187-3-28**] he had decreased melena.
Hematocrit remained stable, but decreased slightly to 29.5
overnight.  He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells,
which bumped his hematocrit to 31.9.  His creatinine again
continued to trend down from 3.2 to 2.9 and urology felt that
this was most likely benign prostatic hyperplasia with some
component of retention and/or obstruct
