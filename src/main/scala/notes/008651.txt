Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
tachypnea, elevated lactate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo F with a hx of dementia, HTN, and a large RLL
mass who presents with poor PO intake and a cough for the last
three days. She resides at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Nursing home and the
above symptoms were noted by the staff. Labs drawn on [**5-15**] showed
a BUN of 88 and a creatine of 4. She was started on IVF but
stopped after 600cc after ? increased wetness of cough. Per the
NH, prior to ED transfer her UOP was minimal. Her labs continued
to worsen on [**5-16**] so she was sent to the ED for eval.
.
In ED, vitals were 97.8, 92, 136/85, 36, 95% 4L . A CXR was
noted to have a RML/RLL infiltrate so she received
vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin for HAP as well as nebs. No one was
able to place a foley due to ? obstruction by pelvic mass but
pelvic CT showed the problem was a collapsed bladder with no
mass seen. She was given 2L of NS in the ED but had a
persistently elevated lactate with no hypotension. She was also
noted to be markedly tachypneic with RR in the 30s but without
significant hypoxia, satting 95% on 2L. Given these two
features, she was admitted to the ICU.
.
On presentation to the ICU, she notes that she feels "lowsy" and
feels SOB. Denies chest pain, N/V/D. Notes some occasional r
sided abdominal pain. Rest of ROS not obtainable due to
patient's dementia and poor historian.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 yo F with dementia, hiatal hernia, RLL mass who
presents with lethargy, decreased PO intake, SOB, and ARF.
.
#. PEA: The patient went into PEA and then aystole.  She was
DNR/DNI.
.
#.Respiratory failure/HAP: The patient had a known RLL mass,
that was likely causing a post obstructive pneumonia.  Given her
large hiatal hernia she was at increased risk of aspiration and
the infiltrate in her RLL and RML lung zones was larger
suggestion recent aspiration. She was treated for a possible
HAP.  She was placed on vancomycin, cefepime, levoqin, and
flagyl.  After her first night in the ICU her levoquin was
discontinued. She was also treated with nebs. She was ventilated
her first evening in the ICU with non-invasive BiPAP for
hypercarbia which was likely secondary to dilaudid.  She also
had evidence of volume overload and was on CVVH.  The next
morning in the ICU her respiratory status continued to decline
with increasing oxygen requirement.  The patient was DNR/DNI.
She was continued on facemask oxygen.
.
#.Anuric renal failure:  The patient had a collapsed bladder
leading to anuria.  Her renal dopplers were negative. A IJ HD
catheter was placed and she was started on CVVH.  The patient
was noted to be hypocalemic and was started on continous calcium
infusion.
.
#. RUQ pain: The patient had intermittent RUQ pain.  A CT of the
abdomen showed pancreatitis and cholelithiasis.  She was kept
NPO and was written for morphine PRN.
.
#. Acidosis: The patient had acidosis that was partly uremic and
partly lactic.  Her acidosis was likely secondary to her taking
metformin in setting of renal failure.  She was changed to an
ISS and her acidosis was improving.
.
#. Elevated lactate/AG acidosis:  Her AG acidosis was likely
from relatively poor perfusion in the setting of hypovolemia due
to poor PO intake. The concurrent use of metformin was likely
contributing to her acidosis in the setting of renal failure.
Uremia was likely also contributing to her acidosis.
.
#. Hyperkalemia: She had hyperkalemia likely from ARF.  She had
no EKG changes and was treated with  kayexelate as well as CVVH.

.
.#. HTN: She was continued on her home verapamil. An arterial
line was placed to better monitor her BP.
.  .
#. Gout: Allopurinol was held in the setting of renal failure.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: She was continued on her home simvastatin.
.
#. Hypothyroidism: She was continued on levothyroxine.
.
#. Dementia: She was continued on home aricept and namenda  .
.
#. PPx -  DVT ppx with SQ Heparin, bowel regimen, and PPI.
.
#. Code - DNR/DNI
