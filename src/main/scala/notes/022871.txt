Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for GIB, hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Blood transfusion at NEBH
EGD [**2-11**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD,
h/o CVA, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2-3**] with SOB, lightheadedness, and black stools.
She was found to have an INR of 11 and was given 4 units of FFP
and 10mg vitamin K. She received 3 units PRBC to bring her Hct
up to 37.5. Last INR showed correction to 1.3. She was seen by
GI with plans for endoscopy, but on arrival to the endoscopy
suite she was found to be hypoxic while lying flat. The
procedure was cancelled and she was given Solumedrol 125mg IV.
She was reportedly in sinus tach to 104. Because of clinical
evidence of volume overload, she received 80mg IV Lasix. She was
later found to be afib to 150 at which point Diltiazem 10mg IV
was given as well as digoxin 0.5mg IV. She reportedly converted
to sinus rhythm. The patient's family requested transfer to a
[**Location (un) 86**] area hospital at which point the referral to [**Hospital1 18**] was
made. At that time the patient was reportedly on 3L NC satting
93% with HR in the 100s (sinus tach) and systolic BP in the
120s.

The patient arrived on the floor on a NRB mask satting 90% with
a HR in the 140s. EMS reported that overnight she had triggered
the rapid response team again for hypoxemia and was sent to
their ICU where she was on BiPAP. She was reportedly given
another 80mg IV lasix this am and 10mg IV dilt per EMS (although
this was not reflected in the discharge summary, which did not
recount any of these events after the call-in to [**Hospital1 18**]). Her SBP
was in the 130s during transfer and HR and O2 sat were as they
were on arrival. The patient was alert and able to answer
questions but only with 1-2 word answers. She was in significant
respiratory distress with SBP in the 140s-150s and HR in the
120s-140s. O2 sat was 88-95% on NRB. She triggered immediately
for these vital signs and the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was called immediately on
arrival.

Pertinent Results:
wbc 7.3 (was 23K on admission)
hgb stable 10s, hct 30s (s/p 3U prbc at OSH)
BUN/creat 25/1.0-stable (was 2.0 at OSH)
INR 1.1
Trops peak 0.39, last 0.14

.
.
EKG [**2-11**]: sinus, diffuse STD/TWI in strain pattern (present in
EKGs from [**2-8**] and [**2-9**])

.
.
Imaging/results:
CXR [**2-6**]: Interstitial moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2-9**]: Decrease in bilateral pleural effusions, which are
small in size. Emphysema. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
CXR [**2-12**]: Small bilateral pleural effusions persist, right
greater than left. No airspace consolidation or edema.
Prominent pulmonary arterial contour suggests underlying
pulmonary arterial hypertension possibly due to known emphysema.
Prior to patient discharge evaluation with PA and lateral
radiographs recommended to confirm enlarged pulmonary artery and
to exclude a mediastinal mass.
.
.
CXR PA/Lat [**2-13**]
REASON FOR EXAM: 69-year-old woman with abnormal portable x-ray.
Evaluate enlarged pulmonary contour versus mediastinal mass.
Impression: Since [**2178-2-12**] and other priors back to
[**2178-2-6**], all done with a portable AP technique,
moderate cardiomegaly and hyperinflation are unchanged.
[**Hospital1 **]-apical scarring is significant with bilateral apical
thickening, up to 1.4 cm on the left. Traction bronchiectasis in
both upper lobes and superior hilar retraction, mostly on the
left are present, all consistent with prior granulomatous
exposure such as tuberculosis. Hilar retraction could explain
the mediastinal abnormality, although no prior study
is available for comparison. Bilateral pleural effusions
decreased, now minimal.
*First, comparison with prior studies from elsewhere is
recommended. If not available, a chest CT for further
characterization and followup in six months by chest x-ray are
recommended
.
.
ECHO [**2-9**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EGD [**2-11**]: Small hiatal hernia, Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Erythema and granularity in the antrum compatible with gastritis
(biopsy), Erythema and atrophy in the stomach body compatible
with gastritis, Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the
duodenum--biopsy c/w chemical gastritis.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 female w/ h/o afib on coumadin, h/o embolic CVA, remote PUD
not on PPI, COPD, CKD II, admitted to OSH [**2-3**] with melena/[**Hospital 80627**]
hospital course there complicated by Afib/RVR resulting in acute
distolic CHF and hypoxemic resp failure. Was tranfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
MICU [**2-6**]. As for GIB, INR 11 on admission, given ffp/VitK  and
transfused 3U at OSH and no more GIB after arrival to [**Hospital1 18**].
While in MICU sercie, rate controlled (had some difficulty
likely because overwhelming adrenergic response to GIB-->amio,
dig, BB, dilt gtt-->finally controlled). As a result of
Afib/RVR, developed Acute diastolic heart failure, diuresed
(needed lasix gtt), now near euvolemia. Was transfered to Gen
Med [**2-11**]. Underwent EGD that day, showed gastritis (biopsy with
chemical gastritis), keep on PPI [**Hospital1 **] X6weeks, then qd while on
coumadin. no more celebrex. Coumadin restarted with heparin
5000U SC TID for bridging (not full bridging given recent bleed,
but need some coverage given h/o recent embolic strokes).
From cardiac standpoint, doing well overall, remained in sinus
back on home meds, but still requiring O2. This is likely combo
of mild CHF and COPD/bronchits (large part). Plan is to d/c home
with short course of lasix/nebs/O2 with close VNA follow up to
titrate off. Needs PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], cards follow up.
.
.
Please see detailed plan below according to problem list:
.
Acute Diastolic heart failure/Hypoxia: in setting of Afib RVR on
admission. s/p lasix gtt and rate control. Though near
euvolemic, still with crackles and O2 requirement and last CXR
with small effusions. Strict HR control.
-start lasix 40mg PO qd for short time, monitor BP, urine outpt,
creat. Repeat Chem in 1week. Home VNA for CHF nursing to wean
off lasix (does NOT need chronically so long as HR controlled)
-note BP unequal in arms and should be checked only R arm (too
low L arm)
-c
