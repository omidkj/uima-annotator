Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6736**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cystoscopy

History of Present Illness:
57 yo M non-ischemic cardiomyopathy [**2096**] with EF recovery to
50%, atrial flutter s/p ablation, cervical stenosis, and
hematuriahere for cystoscopy.  Pt desat to 60s after initial LMA
placement, was reintubated with initiation of
propofol/midazolam, and had another episode of desat to 60s for
~ 5mins, but was able to resume the procedure.  During the
procedure, pt was noted to appear "not well, and turning black".
 He became hypotensive to SBP 80s for about 20 mins, and dropped
to SBP 50s for several minutes during the procedure. No
definitive anaphylaxis and was premedicated with 100 mg
hydrocortisone and benadryl prior to retrograde pyelogram. No
contrast extravasation and has had previous CT with contrast
without any issues. His hypotension responded to phenylnephrine,
and was also given a total of 120 mcg epiniphrine for concerns
of anaphylaxis. Minimal blood loss was reported. An A-line was
put in.  An introp TEE was performed, which showed EF 25-30%
with inferior wall motion abnormalities. ABG showed respiratory
acidosis 7.24/54/110/26, lactate 3.2. An EKG was unchanged from
his baseline. Cardiology was consulted, and recommended transfer
to the ICU for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS T 97.7, HR 81, BP 135/91
(to SBP > 200 within the hour of transfer). He was sedated and
intubated for assist control ventilation. Labs were significant
for WBC 14, lactate 3.2, . A CXR showed L pleural effusions as
demonstrate by retrocardiac opacification, otherwise unchanged
compared to a previous film in [**2101**].

ECHO [**8-23**]: There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior wall akinesis. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Technically-limited study.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2100-4-20**], definite regional wall motion
abnormalities are now seen, anatomically-consistent with
sequelae of CAD.

CXR [**8-23**]: FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been
obtained with patient in semi-upright position.  The patient is
moderately rotated to the right, apparently intubated and the
tube seen to terminate in the trachea some 4 cm above the level
of the carina.  No pneumothorax can be seen.  The patient is
poorly ventilated at the time of the image exposure with very
high positioned diaphragms and low volume.  With the exception
of a small plate atelectasis on the left base and some prominent
mediastinal structures on the right side, no abnormalities are
seen.  The lateral pleural sinuses are free and no pneumothorax
is identified in the apical area. The next preceding chest
examination available in our records is dated [**2101-8-14**] and
at that time normal chest findings were present.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old male with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy [**2096**] (EF 50%),
atrial flutter s/p ablation, cervical stenosis, and hematuria
who presents with hypotension and hypoxia during elective
cystoscopy.

OR COURSE:
Pt was initially scheduled for outpatient cystoscopy. LMA was
placed, and despite easy ventillation and good EtCO2, pt
desaturated.  LMA was removed and mask ventillation failed to
improved SpO2. Pt was then intubated with normalization of VS,
and procedure progressed. During the procedure, pt became
hypotensive, but did respond to several epinephrine boluses.
TEE in OR showed depressed EF, so pt remained intubated and was
transferred to the ICU for further management.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypotension: The cause of poor ventilation and hypotension was
unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] may have had a reaction to the anesthetic drugs used
and had also received hydrocortisone and benadryl. A
anaphylactic reaction is unlikely. He was already intubated for
hypoxia (see below), and his blood pressure responded to
administration of phenylephrine and epinephrine. An emergent TEE
showed inferior wall hypokinesis EF 25%. EKG showed left axis
deviation and no new ischemic changes. He was given IV fluids
and was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU labs were significant
for elevated WBC 14, lactate 3.2, ABG 7.28/54/110, and negative
cardiac enzymes. CXR showed a left retrocardiac opacity
concerning for consolidation / atelectasis / infiltrate. There
was concern for septic shock given hypotension, elevated WBC,
and LLL infiltrate, however this was considered less likely as
he remained afebrile, his lactate normalized, and his BP
corrected quickly without antimicrobials or pressors. He was
observed overnight, and his cardiac enzymes were negative x 3. A
repeat TTE showed persistent inferior wall hypokinesis, however
showed an improved EF to 40%. He was treated with PO predisone
40mg for 3 days given the concern for delayed anaphylactic
reaction. His blood and urine cultures were negative at the time
of dis
