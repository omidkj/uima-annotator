[**2170-3-1**] Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
72 year old female who presents with abdominal pain x1day. She
has been feeling ill for last 2-3 days with intermittent
non-bloddy diarrhea with acute onset of back pain radiating
around flanks to chest.  Pain which began at 8:30pm on the night
prior to admission. Regarding location it originates in the mid
back, radiating around her flanks to the front and also goes
through the abdomen and sometimes to both arms. Pain exertional
in nature and also exacerbated by eating. Pain relieved with
rest. In the ED, EKG showed NSR at [**Street Address(2) 109576**] depressions in the
lateral leads with possible ST elevations in V2 concerning for
ischemia. Cardiac enzymes returned elevated with CK 663, MB 57,
trop 0.6. CXR with new mild interstitial pulmonary edema. No
evidence of pneumonia. She was then referred for cardiac
catheterization. Cath showed showed severe triple-vessel disease
with preserved left ventricular function and severe mitral
regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation was confirmed by echo and
she was referred for cardiac surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2170-3-1**] Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant
system revealed native severe three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA is short without flow limiting stenosis.  The
LAD has a proximal 90% tubular lesion with a high D1 with
proximal 80% stenosis.  The LCx has a diffuse proximal/mid
vessel 70% stenosis.  The RCA has a proximal occlusion. The
distal RCA fills well from LAD collaterals. 2. Limited resting
hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left ventricular filling
pressures with LVEDP 20 mmHg and normal systemic arterial
pressure with central aortic pressure of 110/66 with a mean of
82 mmHg.  There was no aortic valve gradient seen on carefull
pullback from left ventricle to aorta. 3. Left ventriculography
revealed moderately severe mitral regurgitation, global and most
marked apical hypokinesis with an LVEF 38%. 4. An episode of
ventricular fibrillation occurred during catheter change,
promptly cardiverted with return to sinus rhythm and no further
arrhythmia noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 109577**] is a 72 year-old female with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, presenting with back pain radiating to chest x1
day with labs demonstrating myocardial infarction. She underwent
cardiac catheterization shortly after admission which
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. Cath and
subsequent echo also revealed mitral regurgitation. During cath
she did have a VF arrest and was successfully defibrillated. She
was medically managed for her MI and acute systolic heart
failure while being worked-up for surgical intervention. On [**3-3**]
she was brought to the operating room where she underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 4 and mitral valve repair. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta-blockers and diuretics
were started and she was gently diuresed towards her pre-op
weight. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. On post-op day two she was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. She continued to make good
progress while working with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. Medications were resumed for her latent TB. On post-op
day five she was discharged to rehab with the appropriate
medications and follow-up appointments.
