Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity pain and swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Incision and drainage of right calf hematoma with placement
of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain ([**4-1**])

History of Present Illness:
65 yo woman w/ h/o COPD, respiratory failure s/p trach [**1-20**]
after failure to wean post-op at [**Hospital1 2177**] after ruptured diverticula
s/p surgical repair, as well as being recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
MICU [**Date range (1) 71218**] for asystolic cardiac arrest at rehab on [**2128-3-20**]
after d/c'd there from [**Hospital1 2177**], who presents today from [**Hospital 671**]
[**Hospital 4094**] Hospital w/ worsening right leg pain and swelling.
This was first noted by the RN yesterday morning.  The patient's
right leg was noted to be more swollen and ecchymotic today so
she was sent in for evaluation.  Per report, patient is usually
in bed and has been bed bound since arrival to rehab on [**2128-3-25**]
from her last admission at [**Hospital1 18**].   Per patient, her leg pain
has been worsening for weeks.  Denies numbness or tingling.  She
is able to move her foot, but states that this is very painful.

.
On arrival to ED, patient afeb, tachy to 112, satting 100% on AC
450x16/5/0.3.  Plain films of knee and tib/fib did not reveal
fracture.  LENI negative for DVT; however, a 12cm hematoma seen.
 Vascular surgery drained hematoma in ED.  Also noted to have
WBC of 19, stable from her last admission, but then up to 30
prior to leaving ED.  Currently, receiving Vanc/Gent since last
admission to cover for possible VAP after acinetobacter
[**Hospital1 **] found in sputum.  In addition, bicarb 42 (2 days ago
at rehab was 41); ABG unsuccessful in ED.  RT informed ED staff
of bad cuff [**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cuff pressures were increased to the 40's.
Also reports of patient disconnecting vent tubing multiple times
while in ED.  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN staff were concerned that this may be
purposeful.  Although pt has h/o depression, she denies SI.
While in ED, patient received Xanax 0.25mg x1, seroquel 50mg x1,
ativan (total 2.5mg), and morphine 1mg x1.
.
Patient admitted to the MICU for observation after drainage of
her hematoma.  Currently, patient answering some questions,
denies pain.

treated w/ vancomycin and gent
- COPD (steroid dependent)

- depression
- HTN

.
Of note, recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2177**], she presented with fall
and weakness, found to be in a fib with AVR, converted to sinus
rhythm.  Apparently intubated for respiratory failure in setting
EtOH withdrawal and DT's.  While intubated, had fever to 103.8,
elevated WBC and + blood cultures. abd CT with free air and to
OR for ex-lap with sigmoid colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] procedure.
post-op she could not be weaned off the vent and underwent trach
and PEG tube on [**2128-2-5**]. she was discharged to [**Hospital3 **]
on vanco due to her + blood cultures and MRSA history.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE:
.
#) RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY HEMATOMA: 12cm hematoma found on LENI
on admission.  This was thought likely to be related to
anticoagulation received for PE which was started on recent
hospital admission.  s/p drainage by surgery in ED (>200cc
drained).  No evidence of compartment syndrome per surgery.
Hematocrit dropped during admission, requiring a total of 7units
PRBC transfusions throughout entire admission.  On [**2128-4-1**],
patient went to OR with vascular surgery s/p evacuation of
hematoma and placement of JP drain.  Last transfusion was night
of [**2128-4-2**].  Anticoagulation was continued to be held at the
time discharge.  Bilateral LENI's negative for DVT.  Removable
IVC filter was placed in OR by vascular surgery on [**2128-4-1**].
.
#) FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS: The patient was found to have a
significant leukocytosis during her last admission (WBC 16 at
the time of d/c).  Her WBC count on this admission was initially
18.8 w/ 80N, 16L.  On review of prior labs here, her WBC count
seemed to be chronically elevated in past.   She also had a low
grade temp early in her admission.  Her UA and CXR were
negative.  Blood cultures also negative.  She was continued on
Gentamicin and vancomycin started on her last admission for her
known VAP of acinetobacter and MSSA (although has h/o MRSA).
Sputum this admission grew acinetobacter again sensitive to
gentamicin, as well as MRSA.  Antibiotics were discontinued
after a 14 day course.
.
In addition, the hematopathologist reported that her peripheral
blood smear showed immature forms and performed flow cytometry
on her blood.  Per preliminary report, flow cytometry on her
peripheral blood showed approximately half of her lymphocytes
were abnormal/lymphoma cells.  Heme/path commented that this
appeared to be co
