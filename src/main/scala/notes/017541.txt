Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bacitracin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
malaise, SOB x3-4 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with IPF on 2-3L NC home O2, DM2, depression,
h/o CVA 5 years prior presenting with progressive malaise x [**3-17**]
days, increased DOE, and shortness of breath referred from PCP
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] for increased oxygen requirement and ? PNA. Patient
reports increased malaise over weekend with mild cough
productive of white sputum. Daughter had also noticed increased
DOE after approx. 1 min of walking as opposed to 3 minutes. She
also repors chest congestion but denies chest pain,
palpitations, fever, chills, decreased PO intake, N/V/D, leg
pain or swelling. O2 sats have been stable around 95% on 3L NC.
She made appointment with PCP and was seen in clinic where she
was noted to be 85% on 5L NC with rhonchi heard on right.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.6 BP127/73 HR110 RR22 94% 3L.
CXR was difficult to interpret but revealed possible lingular
infiltrate so she was given CTX and Azithro. Blood cx x 2 drawn
prior to abx. Labs remarkable for lactate 2.2, WBC 7. She
desaturated to 78% on 3L so placed on NRB. She was weaned down
to 6L so initially was going to floor but had repeat episode of
desaturation so placed on NRB and bed request changed to ICU
given O2 requirement. VS prior to transfer: HR 100-120 BP 130/80
94% 6L NC.
.
On the floor, breathing mildly improved with O2 and pt anxious
but not coughing.


Past Medical History:
# Diabetes Mellitus
# Pontine Stroke in [**2186**] - reportedly had carotid duplex exams
at that time and no intervention recommended. She recoverd
nearly completely, though has residual mild left hemiparesis.
# Depression - she developed profound depression following her
stroke, now treated
# Hypercholesterolemia
# Hypertension
# Pulmonary Fibrosis - Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**], established
care in [**2191-7-14**]. Presumed IPF although no biopsy performed.
[**Last Name (un) **] n any medicatiosn other than O2. Largely asymptomatic with
routine daily activities, but dyspnea develops with increased
exertion. Pulmonary function tests [**7-/2191**] show FEV1 and vital
capacity 0.88 and 1.0 (44 and 35% predicted respectively).
Vital capacity may be underestimated due to abrupt termination
of exhalation. Pulmonary function tests done at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2191-7-21**] show that she was not able to perform
lung volumes or diffusing capacity.  Her spirometry showed FEV1
of 0.96 and vital capacity 1.1.  There was no improvement after
albuterol.

Social History:
She lives in [**Hospital1 392**] with her daughter [**Name (NI) **].  She has been a
widow since [**2159**]. She worked as an appraiser for the IRS until
age 78, a job she really enjoyed. She retired at the time of her
stroke. She has two daughters, one, [**Name (NI) **], who accompanies her
lives in [**State 350**], and another who lives in [**State 5887**].
She has a son who lives in [**Name (NI) 12000**].  She smoked only for 10
years and quit many years ago. She has one alcoholic beverage
per night ([**Location (un) 21601**], scotch, or glass of wine). Denies TB
exposure. She has a dog but no other pets.
.

EKG [**2191-9-20**]
Sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Delayed R wave progression with
late precordial QRS transition. Modest low amplitude right
precordial T wave changes. Findings are non-specific. Since the
previous tracing of [**2190-8-27**] sinus tachycardia is absent and axis
is less leftward.

Chest Xray [**2191-9-20**]
Severe pulmonary fibrosis, without new airspace opacity
definitively seen

CTA Chest [**2191-9-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus. Moderate-to-severe
pulmonary arterial
hypertension with evidence of right heart strain.
2. Similar appearance of extensive fibrotic disease with UIP/IPF
features.
Diffusely increased lung density cannot be adequately evaluated
with this
non-high-resolution CT technique, although could represent
pulmonary edema,
infection or acute exacerbation of fibrotic process.
3. Stable left upper lobe 6-mm nodule.
4. Large hiatal hernia.
5. Thyroid nodule, stable.
6. Compression fracture, stable.
7. Subcentimeter liver hypodensity, which is too small to
characterize,
stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old woman with pulmonary fibrosis admitted with
progresive malaise and DOE with increased O2 requirement last
3-4 days.

# Hypoxic respiratory distress: The patient was admitted to the
MICU due to her high oxygen requirement.  The differential for
the patient's respiratory distress included either bacterial or
viral PNA, PE, CHF, or IPF exacerbation.  She was started on a
5-day course of ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover for CAP.
She underwent a CTA which showed no evidence of a PE.  She was
initially placed on a 100% NRB, but was able to be weaned to
nasal cannula oxygen soon after reaching the MICU.  She remained
stable on 5-6L NC O2, with O2 sats in the mid 90s.  She did
desaturate to the mid 70s-80s with exertion, however, both her
and the family say that is her normal baseline.  She would
recover to the mid 90s quickly with rest.  Steroids were not
given as the patient seemed to be improving on the antibiotics
with a rapid wean off the NRB.  Ms. [**Known lastname 10113**] was transferred to
the General Medicine Floor when she was stable on 6L nasal
cannula.  Pulmonary evaluated her and recommended supplemental
O2 to maintain O2sats > 90%. Initiation of steroids was deferred
for now based on patient's preference and concern re: glycemic
control but could consider a steroid trial if she does not
progress as expected while at inpatient pulm rehab.  Vasodilator
therapy should be considered as an outpatient once disease more
stabilized but not currently.  Patient should schedule
appointment with pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] within 1-2 weeks of
discharge for repeat echocardiogram, spiromemtry/DLCO, +/-
imaging.
.
# DM2: The patient's metformin was held as she got a contrast
load for her CTA.  She was covered with an ISS while in-house.
Metformin restarted on discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Home amlodipine was initially held in MICU, then
restarted once pressures began to increase.
  .
# Hyperlipidemia: Continue home atorvastatin 10mg.
.
# History of CVA: Continued on daily aspirin.
.
# Depression and Anxiety: Continued on Lexapro, Mirtazapine and
ativan as needed.
.
# Normocytic Anemia: Nl MCV with widened RDW.  [**Month (only) 116**] have element
of iron deficiency anemia given ferritin 31.  Should have
further workup as a
