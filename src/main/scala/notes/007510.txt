Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

On post operative day 1, the patient was found to have sustained
rapid afib with HR to 140s-150s with SBPs of 70s-80s, down from
90s-110s.  Patient asymptomatic.  Was given 500 cc NS bolus (to
a total of 2L+ today) and 5 mg lopressor IV and transferred to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.  On arrival the patient was stable
with BP 94-44, HR of 80 and denied any symptoms.  The patient
received a 500cc of NS and converted to sinus rhythm with SBP of
78, but asymptomatic.  His blood pressure improved to the 90's
to 100's and the patient remained in sinus rhythm. He also
received 2 units of packed red blood cells with lasix for HCT
22, given his CHF. ECG notable for RBBB, tri-fascicular block
and PR prolongation.  We spoke with cardiologist and confirmed
falodipine and propanolol dose

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

On POD 3, a repeat XR was checked to re-confirm component
position as the leg was internally rotated, but components were
found to be in good position, no dislocation.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions.
