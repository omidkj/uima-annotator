History of Present Illness:
51 y/o M with hx of DM, asthma, depression and CKD who presents
today with respiratory distress.  Starting three days prior to
admission, he was noting a very dry cough and having some
shortness of breath.  Was nauseated but no vomiting.  Also have
some mild diarrhea.  He was having increasing wheezing and using
his albuterol inhaler at home.  Also noted fevers, chillls and
sweats and had a fever up to 104 at home.  He was trying to keep
himself out of the hospital to make it a doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) 648**] on
the day after admission.  Some of his family also had
respiratory symptoms.

He has had asthma exaccerbations before, but has never needed to
be intubated.  He recently has a hernia repair.

In the ED, his initial vitals were 100.4, 90s on RA; RR 50, 98%
NRB.  He was treated with levofloxacin and cipro.  He was given
continuous nebs and IV steroids for asthma exaccerbation.  He
was transferred to the ICU on a face mask.

On arrival, he is feeling slightly better than when he first
presented.  He cannot speak in full sentences and is using his
accessory muscle to breath.  He is tachypneic and uncomfortable
and visibly diaphoretic drenching his gown.  He complains of RUQ
pain that started with these current respiratory symptoms.  His
hernia repair was on his L side.  He denies chest pain,
dizziness, nausea, dysuria.

STUDIES:
RUQ US ([**2144-10-18**]):
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
this study.
2. Cholelithiasis with no sign of cholecystitis.
3. Persistent right hydronephrosis.

CXR ([**2144-10-18**]):
Chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle presumably due
to scarring and/or chronic effusion. No acute pulmonary process.

CXR ([**2144-10-21**]): The patient remains intubated. A right internal
central jugular venous catheter terminates at the cavoatrial
junction. A nasogastric tube again courses towards the stomach,
although its distal course is not well characterized.
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The lung
volumes are slightly increased, but in spite of increased lung
volumes, left perihilar and lower lobe opacities seem somewhat
more prominent, suggestive of worsening atelectasis or
pneumonia. Much or all of the left lower lobe is probably
involved. The presence of a coexisting right perihilar opacity
may be due to co-existing pulmonary vascular congestion.

CXR ([**2144-10-26**]): 1. Interval increase of left upper lobe opacity
2. Interval improvement of the left lower lobe opacity
3. Stable mild pulmonary edema.

CXR ([**2144-10-28**]): As compared to the previous examination, the
monitoring and support devices are unchanged. The pre-existing
predominantly left parenchymal opacities have clearly decreased
in extent. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No
newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

CXR ([**2144-10-29**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, the
endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube has been removed. The
right-sided central venous access line is unchanged. Slight
increase in extent of a pre-existing right basal and
retrocardiac opacity. No other parenchymal opacities. Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette.

TTE ([**2144-10-20**]): The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
