Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine Firm/Medical ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87-year-old
woman with a history of COPD, hypertension, and pedal edema
transferred from a nursing home for abnormal laboratories,
nausea, vomiting, and change in mental status.  The patient
recently completed treatment for UTI with Macrobid.  The
patient received extra Lasix the day prior to admission for a
2 pound weight gain and increased pedal edema.

At night, the patient reportedly drank 3 quarts of water and
refused further Lasix.  In the past 24 hours, the patient
became more lethargic, vomited two times, and had a fever to
101.  The laboratories in the nursing home showed a sodium of
115, chloride of 70, and the patient was transferred here for
further care.

Here, the patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath,
cough, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  The patient says she
feels okay, but not thirsty.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives in [**Hospital3 2732**] Home.
She quite tobacco 10 years ago.  She has a prior 30 pack year
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's temperature is 98.6, pulse
98, blood pressure 133/56, respiratory rate 16, and satting
at 97% on room air.  In general, she was an elderly woman,
somnolent and responds appropriately to voice.  Her neck
examination was notable for a left surgical pupil, but
reactive to light.  Oropharynx was moist.  Her neck had
jugular venous distention to 9 cm with no bruits.  Lung
examination:  She had crackles at the right base.  Cardiac
examination:  She had a [**5-20**] blowing systolic murmur and a [**3-22**]
diastolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdomen was
obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Her extremities had 2+ pitting edema to the knees
bilaterally.

Her Chem-7 was remarkable for a sodium of 116, potassium 5.2,
chloride 74, bicarb 25, BUN 17, creatinine 1.3, glucose 127.
She had a white count of 16.8 with 85% polys, 9% lymphocytes,
hematocrit was 37.7, platelets 305.  PTT was 28.0, INR 1.4.
Her calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were normal.  Her
serum osmolality is 1:2 to 2:1, urine osmolality 307, her
lactate was 3.5.  She had a urinalysis that showed greater
than 50 red cells, 21-50 white cells, and many bacteria.  Her
first set of enzymes included a CK of 230, MB of 7.2, and
troponin of 0.66.

She had a chest film that showed a left pleural effusion,
left lower lobe opacity that is most likely atelectasis.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hyponatremia:  This was most likely secondary to the
increased free water intake.  According to the nursing home,
she swallowed several liters of free water.  She was given
very gentle IV hydration, since the electrolytes were also
consistent with dehydration.  Her sodium was checked every
eight hours to ensure that she was not rising too fast since
that can be devastating.

Over the next 2-3 days, her sodium continued to rise
appropriately with simple IV fluids.

2. Respiratory distress:  The patient was noted to be in
significant respiratory distress on the second hospital day.
She was requiring a nonrebreather to sustain oxygen
saturation greater than 95%.  Her examination was notable at
the time for diffuse rhonchi throughout.  In addition, she
also had an echocardiogram done previously that day which
showed right ventricular failure as well as left ventricular
failure that was new.  Given the possibility that this was a
pulmonary embolus, she went for a CT scan.  Was not able to
do a full CT scan since she was not accepting the dye because
that required an IV.  However, the chest CT showed worsening
congestive heart failure.  This was also consistent with the
examination, and so she was diuresed with moderate
improvement.  She continued to be diuresed throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization.

3. Congestive heart failure:  Given the patient's worsening
respiratory status and CHF, a transthoracic echocardiogram
was performed that revealed biventricular failure that was
new of unclear etiology.  This became one of the dominant
issues as the patient was ultimately having worsening
respiratory distress.

Initially Lasix was just used and towards the end of her time
on the floor, she was given Natrecor with some improvement.
This was continued until she passed away.

4. Tachyarrhythmia:  The patient had a tachyarrhythmia on
admission that was originally sinus tachycardic, but soon
became more rapid and consistent with multifocal atrial
tachycardia.  Despite increasing the amount of oxygen, we
were unable to reduce the rate and were unwilling to use
nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] without more close monitoring.  Her blood
pressure tended to go lower towards the end of her
hospitalization, which also made this more challenging.

5. Urinary tract infection:  The patient has a multi-drug
resistant urinary tract infection that is longstanding.  Her
initial urine showed possible infection and so she was
treated with Levaquin and Flagyl.  Urine was repeated several
times.  She has a chronic indwelling Foley, and so it is not
clear whether she had an active infection or just a
contaminant.

6. Pneumonia:  It was possible that some of the findings on
chest film and CT were consistent with a pneumonia including
possibly tuberculosis as she had a right upper quadrant
spiculated pneumonia.  They ruled her out for TB with two
induced sputum before the patient was made CMO.

7. End of life:  The patient's family initially made her
DNR/DNI, but wanted all other measures explored for possible
treatment.  She was thus transferred to Medical Intensive
Care Unit for closer monitoring of her blood pressure and the
ability to follow her cardiac index as they diuresed her.
However, despite these efforts, she was unable to maintain
normal oxygen saturation and became in severe respiratory
distress and so she was made CMO and passed away shortly
thereafter.  This will serve as her death notice.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Pneumonia.
3. Multifocal atrial tachycardia.
4. Subjective pneumonia.
5. Hemolytic anemia.
