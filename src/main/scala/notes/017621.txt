Intubation, central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 80 y/o Spanish-speaking female with h/o MI in
[**2-/2172**] (in setting of urosepsis), RA on steroids, HTN, recent
UTI on levaquin, ? lung disease, who presents with AMS at rehab.

.
Per reports, patient was in USOH at 7am this morning when
patient was evaluated by [**Hospital1 1501**] staff. Per daughter, who last spoke
with patient at 10am, patient was alert and conversant however
noticed that her words were slurred. Was apparently also
nauseous. Later this PM, pt vomited and was noted to have
desatted. She then was noted to be lethargic and less
responsive.
.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
On arrival to ED, patient's vitals were 101.2 92 133/50 19 100%
NRB. Code stroke was called and patient was evalauted by neuro
who left that AMS was [**1-8**] toxic/metabolic causes. NCHCT was
completed and was unremarkable.
.
Given level was consciousness, ABG was completed and showed
significant hypercarbia with pCO2 of 100. Patient was started
BiPAP however SBPs dropped to 73/49. CPAP was then tried and
SBPs remained in 120s and MS improved. Patient was also given 1
dose of CTX for UTI as well as 1000cc of fluid. Lactate was
noted be 1.0. Pt has positive UA and mild leukocytosis. Given
tenuous mental status, patient was admitted to MICU. Prior to
transfer, VS were afebrile HR 76 BP 105/41 RR 17 SpO2 92% on
Cpap (PEEP 5mmHg).
.
In MICU, pt was minimally responsive to sternal rub.
Review of systems:

Micro:
- [**2172-6-25**]: URINE CULTURE-PENDING

.
Images:
- CT HEAD: (prelim read) No acute intracranial hemorrhage or
mass effect. White matter hypodense areas- likely non-spf;
consider MR if not CI to exclude acute infarction.
- CTA Head and Neck: (prelim read) Atherosclerotic disease at
the common carotid bifurcations- pending review of reformations
to assess the extent of stenosis. Focal prominence at the
junction of the A1 and A2 on the right may relate to confluence;
however, to be reviewed on ref. to exclude a small incidental
aneurysm. ( se 3, im 246)
No obvious flow limiting stenosis, occlusion or obvious
aneurysm.
Final read pending all the 3D reformations.
- CXR: [**2172-6-25**]
Lung volumes are quite low, making it difficult to determine if
there really is pulmonary vascular congestion or just vascular
crowding and whether there is atelectasis or consolidation at
the base of the left lung. Heart size is top normal. No
pneumothorax.

- CXR: [**2172-6-30**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the patient has been extubated. The nasogastric tube has also
been removed. The right-sided subclavian vein catheter is in
unchanged position. Also unchanged are the external pacemaker
leads. Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires, unchanged
position of the valve replacement.

The pre-existing signs of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema,
combined to a
retrocardiac and left basal atelectasis as well as to a left
pleural effusion are unchanged. A previously described right
pleural effusion is no longer visible. There is no evidence of
newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities

Echo showed "mild symmetric LVH with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mildly thickened mitral
bioprosthesis with normal function. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension."
.
AS PER [**Hospital3 **] REC:
[**2172-4-3**] CT- pelvis: this was done for evaluation of hip
replacement.
- Showed extensive diverticulosis w/out diverticulitis. Urinary
bladder significantly distended. There is a small ventral hernia
in the region of the pelvis that contains small bowel loops and
extensive vascular calcification. No other comments on urinary
tract system.



Brief Hospital Course:
80 y/o F with history of recurrent UTIs, MI, RA on steroids who
presents with sudden onset altered mental status in setting of
fever and positive UA found to have hypercarbia (Pc02: 100)
requiring bipap and subsequent intubation.

#. Acute on Chronic Hypercapnia: Severe hypercarbia with pCO2 to
100. Felt to be secondary to baseline obstructive disease in
setting of hypoventilation from significant AMS from recieiving
tramadol and quinolone and a UTI. Pt initially failed NIPPV from
mental status standpoint and was intubated. Started
CTX/Azithromycin for CAP, however broadened to linezolid (VRE
history) and cefepime. Able to be weaned from ventilator, was
diursed with IV Lasix gtt. Weaned off the vent to room air. Had
episodes of hypotension that were fluid responsive in the MICU.
Urine culture grew [**Last Name (LF) 100098**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] patient was narrowed to
cefepime only. Her respiratory status improved greatly. Patient
will follow up with pulmonary clinic.

2. Altered Mental Status/Somnolence: CT head unremarkable, EKG
unremarkable, sedating meds were limited. Likely related to pain
medication, levofloxacin she received plus UTI. Improved with
treatment of UTI and holding these medications.

#. Hypotension: Transiently after receiving sedation. Normal
lactate, EKG. NICOM showed fluid responsiveness and was given
IVF's. Got subclavian CVL which was removed after PICC placed.

#. Urinary tract infection: Has h/o VRE in urine per daughter.
Recurrent UTI with prior urosepsis in [**12/2171**] requiring
intubation at [**Hospital6 **]. UCx grew out Pseudomonas
Cipro resistant (was treated with Levaquin as outpt before
admission), intermediate Gent, otherwise sensitive. Will be
treated with a 14 day course of Cefepime. She will also follow
up with ID in the outpatient for other possible management of
her resistant UTIs.

# CHF/CAD: s/p MI in 03/[**2171**]. EKGs unremarkable. Recent Echo
shows EF: 75%. Roughl
