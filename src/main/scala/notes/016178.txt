Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75697**] is a 63 yo M s/p gastric bypass surgery who
presented with 3 episodes of syncope over 3 days. The syncopal
episodes came on suddenly and he lost consciousness, once while
waiting in the elevator and once on the toilet. He has a hx of
vasovagal syncope during defecation. He had never experienced
these symptoms when not passing a BM. His witnessed events were
not accompanied by shaking/jerking motions, there was no
incontinence, tongue biting. He recovered within minutes and did
not have focal weaknesses after the episodes. He denied SOB,
palpitations, pain.

In the ED, he had a positive LENIS and was found to have a
saddle PE by CTA. He was hemodynamically stable but over
concerns of subsequent clot emboli burden, he was given an IVC
filter.

Imaging:

CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism with saddle embolism
and
involvement of all pulmonary lobes. Evidence of right heart
strain.
Recommend correlation with echocardiogram. No evidence of
pulmonary infarct.

2. Coarse calcification in the region of the basal inferolateral
left
ventricular wall, most likely representing calcification of the
mitral
annulus, much less likely a calcified basilar left ventricular
aneurysm.
Findings can be further assessed on the afore-recommended
echocardiogram.

3. Multiple pulmonary nodules in the right lung, measure up to 4
mm. If no
risk factors, including history of smoking or malignancy, no
further followup
is necessary. If patient has risk factors, recommend followup
chest CT in 12
months.

4. Post-surgical changes, incompletely evaluated in the upper
abdomen.

5. Punctate right renal calculus.

ECHO
Suboptimal image quality.The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right
atrial pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV is not well characterized but
appears to have normal/borderline free wall function. RV size is
too difficult to assess. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

IMPRESSION: No definite RV strain.

U/S of R thigh

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with hematoma in the muscles of
the right
thigh, measuring 14 x 4.5 cm.

CT-Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Large predominantly intramuscular right thigh and right
gluteal hematoma
likely accounts for the drop in hematocrit in this
anticoagulated patient has
probably enlarged from prior ultrasound exam. Cannot evaluate
for active
extravasation without the use of intravenous contrast. No
retroperitoneal
hemorrhage is present. The right lower extremity/thigh is
asymmetrically
swollen in comparison to the left.

2. Punctate nonobstructive right renal calculi. Slightly
atrophic appearing
left kidney.

3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75697**] is a 63 yo male s/p gastric bypass surgery who
was admitted with multiple syncopal episodes found to have
saddle PE with many smaller pulmonary artery clots. He was
anticoagulated and a IVC filter was placed. On the floor, he
continued to be anticoagulated and developped a right thigh
hematoma that was evaluated for compartment syndrome by ortho
who ultimately suggested that it would heal on its own and that
he did not have compartment syndrome.

He continued to bleed into his right thigh with resultant drop
in Hct and multiple blood transfusions. His hematocrit
eventually stabilized before discharge.

His R thigh pain, initially excrutiating and treated with IV
Dilaudid eventually became much better controlled and Mr.
[**Known lastname 75697**] was able to ambulate with pain that was not
incapacitating. He eventually stopped taking pain medications
while on the floor.

His lacerations on his chin which bled after anticoagulation,
were treated with silvernitrate and were left to heal without
dressings.

His left wrist, injured during on of his  syncopal falls, was
negative for fractures and was left to heal without cast or
splint. The swelling and pain in his wrist decreased
significantly during his stay on the floor.

He was deemed stable for discharge for close follow-up with his
PCP for coumadin regimen management.
