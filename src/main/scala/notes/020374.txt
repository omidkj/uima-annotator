Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status and ?seizure activity

Several Intubations
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old right handed woman with multiple vascular
risk factors including adult onset diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, coronary artery disease who presents with altered
mental status and question of seizure activity with subsequent
right sided weakness. Patient was in her usual state of health
at 8pm [**8-31**] when at 2:30am [**9-1**] started "babbling" per her
husband. Eyes were open but she was unresponsive and drooling.
EMS was called and upon assessment reported ?R eye deviation and
upper extremity tonic/clonic activity R>L. She was given ativan
2mg IV x1 and the movements stopped. On arrive in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED,
paitent received narcan with some improvement of her mental
status; however, eventually was intubated due to persistent
somnolence. Patient was just 2 days prior to admission seen in
the ED at [**Hospital1 112**] (PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39705**] @[**Hospital1 112**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) **]) for
abdominal pain and was discharged from ED with prescription of
oxycodone.

Per old notes obtained from [**Hospital1 112**], in [**7-8**], patient had been in
MICU at [**Hospital1 112**] for hyperosmolar nonketotic complicated by bilateral
watershed anterior and middle infarcts R>L resulting in residual
left upper extremity weakness. Patient was also noted in [**8-8**]
to have bifrontal hypodensities on head CT associated with
mental status deterioration. Patient was seen again by a
neurologist in ED in [**9-8**] when she presented with fever,
tachycardia and R face, arm and leg rhythmic twitching. Twiching
resolved with ativan so patient was discharged on dilantin.
Patient was follow-uped in [**12-8**] oupatient neurology (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39706**] @[**Hospital1 112**]) who found the patient to have limited insight,
disoriented and inatttentive. Able to follow simple commands,
read and write with proximal bilateral arm weakness L>R and
limited gait. He recommended tapering dilantin at that time as
it was unclear whether she ever had seizures and as this would
help in improving her mental status. In addition, he recommended
tapering her off of dilaudid (which she had been taking for her
chronic back pain), atarax and haldol for similar reasons. He
suggested starting atypical anti-psychotics for behavior
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Altered Mental Status/[**Name (NI) **] Pt has a history of seizure
disorder controlled by Dilantin. Pt's altered mental status on
admission was likely due to tonic clonic seizure secondary to
med noncompliance (confirmed by her husband) as her Dilantin
level was subtherapeutic.  [**9-1**] head CT ruled out acute infarct.
[**9-3**] EEG was abnormal. Repeat head CT on [**9-7**] showed no acute
events. She was started on IV Dilantin that was subtherapeutic
throughout most of her admission, likely secondary to decreased
absorption from her other meds and medical problems.  Dilantin
levels eventually became therapeutic and she began po Dilantin
[**9-22**]. She was without signs or symptoms of repeated seizure
activity throughout her admission.  She was near stuporous on
admission, likely post-ictal and secondary to sedating
medications. Her level of consciousness and alertness slowly
improved throughout admission and was noted to be worse when her
husband was not at the bedside. Neurology was consulted and
closely followed her hospital course.  She was discharged to
home with close followup.
.
2) Respiratory [**Name (NI) 39708**] Pt was intubated in the ED for airway
protection and admitted to the SICU for management.  She
self-extubated on [**9-1**], and on [**9-3**] was noted to have
inspiratory stridor with hypoxemia. She was given racemic epi
and heliox with good effect.  ENT laryngoscopy showed L sided
laryngeal edema likely secondary to trauma.  LENI was negative.
L-sided NGT was dc'd, she was given Dexamethasone for 24hrs, and
she was re-intubated using fiberoptics.  She was started on
prophylactic Famotidine.  She self-extubated again on [**9-8**], and
ENT noted subcricoid edema.  She was started on Decadron.  She
was eventually stabilized, extubated, and transferred to
Medicine on [**9-11**].  Soon after transfer on [**9-11**], she became
stridorous with acute desaturation to 84%, and was
re-transferred to the ICU for management with high dose
steroids. She was extubated and re-transferred to the floor on
[**9-17**].  She was stable until [**9-19**] when she was re-transferred to
the ICU for inspiratory stridor.  She received one dose of IV
Dexamethasone and racemic epi with good effect.  Re-evaluation
by ENT revealed minimal edema with erythema.  ENT cl
