Attending:[**Doctor First Name 6716**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 30 year old female who is 25 weeks pregnant who
presented with shortness of breath.

Patient reports that last night she developed a [**Doctor First Name 9140**] cough.
When she coughed, she felt short of breath and a tightness in
her breathing. This morning, she took a nebulizer treatment of
albuterol at home, and called her doctor. She then went to work.
While at work, she reports she was talking on the phone and
reaching for her inhaler when her co-workers reported that her
lips appeared blue-tinged. She then came to the ED.

In the emergency room, her initial vital signs were heart rate
118, blood pressure 154/95, respiratory rate 40, and oxygen
saturation of 96% on room air, 100% on non-rebreather, with
temperature of 98.7.

She was given 125 mg of methylprednisolone, 2 grams of
magnesium, and 3 albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer treatments.
Her respiratory rate improved to the 30's, with an oxygen
saturation of 96% on 2L at time of transfer. Per peak flows in
the ED were 250 at 3 PM, and 200 at 5PM. An ABG was completed
prior to transfer which revealed pH 7.44, pCO2 30, and pO2 148,
HCO3 21. Per report from the ED, a bedside ultrasound revealed
good fetal movement and fetal heart tones at 160 beats per
minute. A chest x-ray was without any evidence of infiltrate,
but there was a mediastinal vascular abnormality.
Upon arrival to the ICU, she reports that her breathing is
improved, and the nebulizer treatments have helped her
breathing. She still feels more short of breath when she moves
around or coughs.

She denies any fevers, but does report she had some chills and
sweats last night. She has not produced any sputum until arrival
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], at which time she noted a white-ish sputum. She has had
no known sick contacts. She did not get a flu shot this year.
She denies any heartburn or GERD symptoms prior to admission,
but currently reports a burning sensation epigastric region. She
has had a difficult time with nausea and vomiting during this
pregnancy. She reports one aspiration-like event several weeks
ago. She also reports that she was treated with a course of
azithromycin around Febuary 23rd, which improved some coughing
she had at the time. No chest pain, visual symptoms. She does
endorse at headache at present. No leg swelling or weight gain.

Physical Exam:
General: Fatigued but pleasant female, in NAD but slightly
uncomfortable appearing, coughing frequently, speaking easily in
full sentences
HEENT: NC/AT. No accessory muscle use. No conjunctival pallor or
scleral icterus. Clear oropharynx.
Neck: Supple, no JVP elevation.
Lungs: Decreased airmovement, however fair movement throughout
all lung fields. Frequent coughing with subsequent wheezing,
scattered rhonchi. No rales appreciated
Cardiac: Regular, borderline tachycardic, no rubs or gallops
appreciated
Abdomen: Gravid, soft, non-tender, non-distended
Extr: Warm, no edema, clubbing, cyanosis. No lesions.
Neuro: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits

([**2150-4-1**]) CHEST XRAY
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are normal, there is no evidence of
overhydration. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the
upper range of normal, however, no signs indicative of
overhydration are seen.

As abnormal finding, there is an atypical right-sided
mediastinal contour and a large abnormal left-sided mediastinal
contour that clearly exceeds the normal dimensions of the aortic
knob. In the lower portions of the thorax, paraaortic line is
seen, however, in the upper portions, this line is missing.
Simultaneously, the left main bronchus seems narrowed. Overall,
these findings could suggest the presence of a double aortic
arch or an associated vascular abnormality with subsequent
narrowing of the left main bronchus. To workup this suspicion,
contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax is recommended.

([**2150-4-3**])CHEST MRI
IMPRESSION:
1. Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. Differential diagnosis
includes sarcoid and malignancy. Further evaluation is
recommended.
2. Normal left-sided aortic arch.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 30y/o female with past medical history of asthma
admitted at 25 weeks gestation with acute asthma exacerbation,
likely triggered from URI and acid reflux.
.
Ms [**Known lastname **] was transferred from the emergency department to the
ICU for further management of her asthma exacerbation. She was
continued on albuterol and ipratropium nubulizer treatments, as
well as po prednisone. She initially required 4 liters of
supplemental oxygen to maintain appropriate saturation, and was
weaned to room air by hospital day #2 and maintaining 97% oxygen
saturation. Peak flows were closely monitored. She had
occasional elevated blood pressures to 150/high 80s, which
typically occured during periods of shortness of breath.
Preeclampsia labs were normal and she had no proteinuria. She
was treated with IV pepcid for GERD. Influenza swab was
negative. On hospital day #2, her cough became more productive
and she was treated with a course of azithromycin for suspected
bronchitis. She remained afebrile and with oxygen saturation of
99% on room air. In regards to fetal testing, she underwent
daily NSTs while in the ICU. She had no signs or symptoms of
preterm labor. [**Doctor Last Name 13675**] was consulted and recommended a course of
betamethasone and further imaging of the questionable vascular
abnormality on chest xray. She was transferred back to the OB
service on [**4-2**]. She underwent close observation on labor and
delivery. Chest MRI (without contrast) revealed mediastinal and
hilar adenopa
