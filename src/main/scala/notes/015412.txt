Allergies:
Amoxicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4980**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o  male, resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, with aortic mechanical
valve secondary to Listeria endocarditis (on coumadin), Coombs
positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (warm autoantibody, on
prednisone), CAD s/p NSTEMI [**7-11**], CKD stage III, chronic CHF
(likely diastolic with EF 50%), and history of GIB who presents
from rehab with dropping HCT. HCT today was 21.8 down from 27.3
on [**2159-12-19**]. Vitals prior to transfer to ED were T 97.2 BP
108/64 HR 86 RR24 99% RA.
.
On arrival to the ED vitals were 97 99/56 84 16 99% RA. In the
[**Name (NI) **] pt reported feeling tired and was noted to be pale.  HCT was
17.9 (baseline HCT 25-30) and INR was 6.1. BUN was notable to be
elevated to 61 with creatinine at baseline of 1.3. Pt had brown
stool but was strongly guaiac positive with indicator.  A right
femoral line was placed and an 18 gauge IV was placed. The pt
was transfused 2 units of packed RBCs, 2 units of FFP, and 2L of
IVF. Vit K was discussed but not given per ED attd recs. He was
seen by heme onc who recommended adding on hemolysis labs. He
received protonix 40 IV x1 and GI recommended against PPI gtt.
They plan for colonoscopy once INR is down. SBP nadired at 95 in
the ED which is low compared to patient's baseline (SBP 120s).
He got tylenol 650mg po x1 for right shoulder pain. His EKG was
unchanged compared to prior.
.
On arrival to the ICU vitals were 97.8 150/67 RR18 96% RA.  He
had shoulder pain at the time of transfer from the streatcher.
He then was pain free. He reported being weak. He states he
feels good after his blood transfusions but otherwise often
feels weak.  He reports approximately 1 BM per day and denies
blood in the stool or black stool.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]  male, resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, with aortic mechanical valve
secondary to Listeria endocarditis (on coumadin), Coombs
positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (warm autoantibody, on
prednisone), CAD s/p NSTEMI [**7-11**], CKD stage III, chronic CHF
(likely diastolic with EF 50%), and history of GIB who presents
from rehab with low hematocrit.
.
# GI bleed: The patient was noted to have a hematocrit drop from
 32 to 17.4 in the setting of supratherapeutic INR of 6.1. He
was h/o chronic anemia with baseline Hct 25-30 secondary to warm
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Chronic kidney disease, and
myelodysplasia.  He had recent admission for HCT drop and upper
endoscopy which showed a non-bleeding duodenal polyp and a small
hiatal hernia. He has history of esophageal erosions/non
bleeding stomach ulcers/gastritis/lymphangiectasias. However, pt
did also have radiation for prostate cancer which could lead to
a lower GI etiology. Given this history we were concerned for GI
bleed. He had a femoral line placed in the ED for access which
was transitioned to a PICC line in the ICU on [**2159-12-23**].  He
received a total of 4 units of packed RBCs and 4 units of FFP.
Subsequently his Hct remained between 24 to 27. GI was consulted
and an EGD was performed. The EGD showed a small hernia but was
otherwise normal with no identifiable source of bleeding. A
capsule endoscopy was then performed and the results were not
available at the time of discharge (plan to be read week of [**12-31**]). He remained hemodynamically stable with stable blood count
on serial hematocrits (HCT of 27 morning of discharge). He was
continued on prednisone 10mg po daily for his autoimmune
hemolytic anemia.
.
# Atrial fibrillation - pt had new onset a fib with RVR to
130s-150s on hospital day number 2. He received IV metoprolol
and IV digoxin with good rate control. He was started on
metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] (carvedilol d/c). We transitioned ot
metoprolol succinate 25mg daily at discharge (not given [**12-27**]).
He is already on anticoagulation for mechanical aortic valve
placed many years ago. Cardiology believed that no intervention
was necessary for the atrial fibrillation acutely and that it
should resolve spontaneously after GI bleed resolves. At
discharge, heart rate noted to be regular with sinus rhythm on
EKG.
.
# Possible Bacteremia - blood cultures on [**12-24**], drawn in
setting of temp to 100.6, with one out of four bottles positive
for Gram + rods and Gram + cocci.  He was started on vancomycin
emperically on [**2159-12-25**] pending speciation. Surveillance
cultures are negative to date. These will need to be followed at
[**Hospital 100**] rehab as results may represent contaminant rather than
bacteremia.
.
# CAD s/p NSTEMI: Pt with shoulder pain in ED. During last
admission had left arm pain which was felt to be the result of
demand ischemia in the setting of an acute HCT drop.  He did
have a + troponin at the last admission.  His EKG was
unremarkable and his troponin plateaued at 0.07.  He was
continued home statin, carvedilol held and started on metoprolol
succinate as above.
.
# Aortic mechanical valve:  Noted to have supratherapeutic INR
of 6.1 on admission (normally his goal INR is 2.5-3.5).  He was
given 4 units of FFp, but no vitamin K. INR trended down and was
1.2 at discharge. He was started on heparin drip after
hematocrit stabalized and INR subtherapeutic. He has been
maintained on heparin for the past 48 hours (PTT of 74 at
discharge) and coumadin has been h
