Date of Birth:  [**2081-9-22**]             Sex:   M

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, calf pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
46 yo M with morbid obesity and hypertension presented to an OSH
with 5 day history of dyspnea on exertion and left calf
cramping. Patient reports he first noticed difficulty breathing
while mowing his lawn 5 days prior to admission and developed
progressive DOE with dyspnea at rest the past 1-2 days. His left
leg felt crampy 2 days ago but he did not notice increase in
edema or redness. He denies chest pain but says his chest feels
like he "just ran a marathon". No orthopnea, palpitations,
cough, fever/chills/night sweats. He has baseline edema of his
lower extremities, which he treats with elevation and
compression stockings. He has not had recent travel or
immobilization, no recent illnesses, no personal or family
history of blood clots or PE. He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with vitals of: 97.9, HR 118, BP 169/105, RR 22, O2 86%
on RA which improved to 95% on 2L NC. ECG there showed sinus
tach at 104 with no ST-T changes. His CXR there was a poor study
but did not indicate acute cardiopulmonary process. D-dimer was
measured and elevated to 8.93 (upper normal 0.48) and troponin
elevated to 0.065. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the emergency department initial vitals were: T 97, HR 100,
BP 147/92, RR 18, O2Sat 98% 4L NC. He was empirically started on
heparin drip with 1000 unit bolus and set at a rate of [**2116**]
units per hour.
Reason for transfer to the MICU is concern for impending
clinical instability given hypoxemia. V/Q scan and CTA could not
be performed given body habitus.
.
At the MICU, patient was slightly agitated and in mild
respiratory distress. He was holding up his NRB mask and laying
flat in bed, speaking in full sentences, but tachypneic and
mildly diaphoretic. His vitals were BP 139/89, HR 116, O2 95% on
NRB. He reported mild SOB, no chest pain with inspiration, no
calf pain.

Past Medical History:
Hypertension

Social History:

active at baseline. Never smoked, intermittent EtOH use ([**6-2**]
beers some days, sometimes a week without drinking), last drink
Wednesday (3-4 beers). No drug use. Mother passed away 5 weeks

Family History:
No family history of blood clots or PEs. Mother had
pancreatic/liver cancer. Father died in [**2116**]. 3 siblings mostly
healthy, sister with MS.

CXR [**2128-5-1**]
Limited study due to technique. Cardiomegaly without signs for
acute cardiopulmonary process.

EKG [**2128-4-30**]
Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

EKG [**2128-5-3**]
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Diffuse
ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific but clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2128-5-1**]
atrial fibrillation has replaced sinus tachycardia and further
ST-T wave changes are present.

EKG [**2128-5-4**]
Sinus rhythm. Diffuse ST-T wave changes are non-specific but
clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of
[**2128-5-3**] sinus rhythm has replaced atrial fibrillation.

Lower Extremity Ultrasound [**2128-4-30**]:
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein. No
definite
thrombus in the right lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
Mr. [**Known lastname 10132**] is a 46y/o gentleman who presented with SOB, hypoxia,
and LLE DVT - though CTA was not feasible, the clinical picture
was consistent with pulmonary embolus. He was started on a
Heparin drip until he was therapeutic on Warfarin.  He became
stable from a respiratory standpoint and he was discharged home.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
.
1. Hypoxia, SOB: Pulmonary Embolus.
Initial increased A-a gradient, O2 requirement, DVT, right heart
strain on EKG all consistent with PE. Though unable to get CTA
due to body habitus, clinical suspicion was very high.  Not a
Lovenox candidate due to body weight; he was started on Heparin
gtt and bridged to Warfarin.  He was weaned to to room air, and
had no O2 requirement even with ambulation.  He will likley
require a 6 month course of treatment.  He will follow up with
his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after discharge (he was given a lab slip for
INR check), and will be followed at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**Hospital 3052**].
.
2. LLE DVT: popliteal DVT.
Detected by tender palpable cord and confirmed by LENI.  He was
anticoagulated as described above.
.
3. Paroxysmal Afib in the setting of PE: reslved.
He had a few episodes of Afib/RVR with rate up to 140 which
responded well to IV Diltiazem; the A fib resolved on [**2128-5-3**] (it
had been <48 hours) and he remained in NSR for the remainder of
his stay.  Episodes were possibly due to PE; unknown if this has
been a problem in the past.  He was started on Metoprolol 25mg
PO BID and will continue this after discharge.
.
4. Hypertension: SBP up to 200's as an outpatient; up to 160
here.
He had not taken Lisinopril for almost a year despite
encouragement from his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was restarted on Lisinopril 10mg
daily, which was uptitrated to 20mg daily.  He will follow up
with his PCP.
.
5. Class III obesity: a risk factor for not only PE, but also
CAD.
He was continued on ASA (81mg in the setting of
anticoagulation). He will have outpatient PCP f/u for healthcare
maintenance and would benefit from a sleep study.
