History of Present Illness:
58 yo F with HIV on HAART, (CD4+:266 and VL undetectable
[**8-/2181**]), HCV cirrhosis w/o known varices, ESRD on HD ([**3-13**] HIV
nephropathy) p/w a Hb of 7 found in HD today. Of note, patient
was recently admitted to the medicine service from [**10-13**]- [**10-16**] for
melana. Push enteroscopy performed on [**10-16**] did not show any
active bleeding but was significant for gastritis. She did not
require any blood transfusions and since she remained HDS was
discharged home with close followup.  Since discharge she
continued to have melontic stools x 5 days with associated
lightheadedness and fatigue that has been constant. Since 5 days
ago Hct: 36.5 ([**10-13**])--> 33 ([**10-16**]) --> 23.2 today. In HD today, 2.7
kg of fluid was taken off.
.
 Of note, she was also admitted [**6-/2181**] with melana, and
underwent a capsule study which showed active bleeding in her
duodenum.  EGD at that time revealed no active bleeding, portal
HTN-ive gastropathy, no esophageal varices noted. A colonoscopy
also performed showed two sessile adenomatous polyps though
examination of mucosa limited by melena which were removed. An
enteroscopy had been attempted at this time but was deferred
since the patient had eaten. She remained without evidence of
melana until this most recent admission [**10-13**].
.
In ED VS were 97.5 95 113/68 16 97% RA. (Baseline sbp in the
110s-120s noted in OMR) Received 1 liter NS. Did not receive
prbcs. NG lavage pink in first 150 cc and did not clear with
another 300 cc -> pink with specs of blood. Given 40 IV
pantoprazole. GI consulted and suggested a tagged RBC scan to
find active bleeding. Notably, guaiac positive brown stool.
Vitals prior to transfer BP: 109/61 87 100% 2L
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient was HDS and felt mildly
fatigued. C/O mild abdominal pain. Blood transfusion was started
prior to transfer to nuclear medicine for tagged rbc.

MICROBIOLOGY: none

IMAGING:
[**2181-10-18**] TAGGED RBC SCAN:
Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood cells
labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the
abdomen for 60 minutes were obtained.
Blood flow images show normal vascular tracer distribution.
Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of tracer within the
gastrointestinal tract.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of GI bleeding.

ADMISSION CXR:
Mild central vascular congestion without overt edema. Stable
cardiomegaly.

Small Bowel Enteroscopy: [**2181-10-16**]
Impression: Erythema in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to jejunum

Colonoscopy:[**2181-6-27**]
Polyp in the transverse colon (polypectomy, endoclip), Polyp in
the sigmoid colon (polypectomy) Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
There was melanotic blood coating along th ecolon mucosa. We
were unable to thoroughly examine the mucosa of colon. Otherwise
normal colonoscopy to cecum

EGD: [**2181-7-3**]: Hiatal hernia noted. Erythema, congestion,
petechiae and abnormal vascularity in the whole stomach
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy. Otherwise
normal EGD to third part of the duodenum. No esophageal or
gastric varices noted. No source of bleeding visualized on
examination to the 3rd portion of the duodenum. Recommend
continue PPI. Would recommend enteroscopy for further
evaluation.

Capsule Study: [**2181-6-28**]
Summary: 1. The capsule remained in the stomach for 3h 2. Active
bleeding in the duodenum 3. Fresh blood in the small bowel 4.
Ileocecal valve could not be identified

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old female with HIV on HAART, (CD4+:266 and VL
undetectable [**8-/2181**]), HCV cirrhosis w/o known varices, ESRD on
HD ([**3-13**] HIV nephropathy) admitted with melena and significant
hematoctrit drop s/p 2 units of PRBCs
.
1. GI Bleed: Source likely Upper GI given melana and pink NG
lavage. Tagged RBC scan did not show active bleeding.  She was
given two units of PRBCs overnight.  She was started on IV
pantoprazole 40 [**Hospital1 **].  Her hematocrit remained stable after red
blood cell transfusion.
.
2. Abdominal Pain: TTP in RUQ/RLQ of unclear etiology. @
baseline.
.
3. ESRD on HD: On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Continued on sevelemer,
nephrocaps  with Epogen in HD
.
4. HIV: Last VL undetectable, CD4+ 266 (7/[**2181**]). Patient started
on Bactrim in previous admissions, however has not been taking.
Reportedly refused Bactrim in previous admission.  Continued
HAART regimen.  Bactrim was held since CD4 is >200, no h/o PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] no history of oral candidiasis which is based on CDC
guidelines.  She was discharged on Bactrim to be further managed
by her primary care/ Infectious disease doctor.
.
5. Hepatitis C: c/b reported cirrhosis and portal hypertension
(portal hypertensive gastropathy, no esophageal varices).
Followed by liver clinic.  Last viral load less than one
million.  Not on interferon.
.
6. Murmur: Harsh holosystolic murmur heard throughout the
precordium.  This should be followed up as an outpatient with an
echocardiogram.
.
Patient left AMA before she was seen by attending and could
receive discharge paperwork.  She was aware of the risks and
benefits of leaving.  She was aware of her post discharge follow
up appointments tomorrow.
