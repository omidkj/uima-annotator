History of Present Illness:
This is a 42-year-old woman with a biliary stricture. Her story
begins with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed in [**2160**] in
[**Male First Name (un) 1056**]. This was complicated by a bile duct injury and she
required an immediate operative
repair in the setting of bile peritonitis. A hepaticojejunostomy
was performed due to a high bile duct injury. I personally
reviewed the operative note which was sent to me from the
original surgeon from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] and realized that there was a
single anastomosis created with 4-0 silk sutures on the bile
duct. Furthermore, an omega limb drainage procedure was created
rather than a Roux-en-Y.

Recently the patient has presented with a right upper quadrant
pain. This was worked up and it was found that she had
right-sided ductal dilation. This was pursued with a PTC
cholangiogram, at which time, a stricture of the right ductal
system was identified. Unfortunately, this could not be
balloon-dilated. Brushings and biopsies were negative. The
cholangiogram was performed and no drainage was achieved.
Subsequent to this she developed a full rip roaring
cholangitis, and it was in the setting of this that she was
referred to me for further care. We found her in good shape,
actually, and treated her with antibiotics and continued the
investigation of this biliary stricture situation.

Also of very important interest here is the fact that her CA19-9
has been high, starting at 700 a month and a half ago and
elevated up to [**2169**] within the last 2 weeks. I performed an
MRCP, as well as a CTA, at our institution to try and
understand if malignancy was in play here. I had a very real
concern that this was the case. Her CT scan showed a general
hypodensity of the whole right anterior right drainage system,
and there were enhancing features on the MRI, as
well. Furthermore, it was clear from the CTA that there was no
evidence of a right hepatic artery in play, and I surmised that
this was injured at the original operative endeavor 17 years
ago.

CONCLUSION:
1. Scans show mild dilatation of the central left hepatic duct
and marked dilatation of all of the peripheral and central ducts
in the anterior right lobe. The trunks of the right and left
bile ducts could not be joined together but were separated by 1
cm of soft tissue near the anastomotic bowel loop. This could
represent neoplastic or fibroinflammatory tissue. Small
intraductal stones were also noted on the right side.
2. Color flow and pulse Doppler assessment demonstrates what
appears to be occlusion of the right hepatic artery with
numerous collaterals in the right porta hepatis. A small
accessory left hepatic artery is also noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 42 year old female with biliary stricture who went to
the OR on [**4-29**] for:
1. Takedown of biliary drainage limb.
2. Conversion of omega limb drainage to Roux-en-Y.
3. Right extended hemihepatectomy.
4. Intraoperative ultrasound.
5. Biliary reconstruction consisting of hepaticojejunostomy
    to left ductal system.

Pain: She had an epidural for pain control. She was followed by
APS and the epidural was removed on POD 5. She was started on a
PCA and once tolerating a diet, she was switched to PO meds.

CV: She had post-op tachycardia. On [**5-3**], she had LENIs that
were negative. She received several fluid boluses for Post-op
Hypotension, and had an appropriate HR and BP response.

GI/Abd: She was NPO, with IVF and a NGT. The NGT was removed on
POD 3. The JP was sent for culture on POD4 and showed 2+ GNRs.
It then grew out ESCHERICHIA COLI and  ENTEROCOCCUS SP. She was
started on Flagyl and already being treated with Cefepime.
Her abdomen was soft and nontender. Erythema was noted on the
right side of the incision and 4 staples were removed and the
incision packed.

Her WBC climbed to 19.7 and a CT was ordered. CT showed Small
fluid collection near the surgical bed in which an external
drain is appropriately placed. Dilated small bowel loops up to
4.1 cm suggestive of an ileus.
The drain was removed and dressing changes were continued.
WBC was 23.7 on [**5-8**] and UCx, BCx and CXR orderded.  Her CXR was
negative for Pneumonia.  She had Ecoli in her Urine Cx and Wound
culture.  She was sent home on PO antibiotics. Her WBC on [**5-9**]
was stable at 23.7.  She was afebrile.

She had occasional post-op emesis. We awaited return of bowel
function. We slowly increased her diet and she was tolerating
regular diet at time of.

Post-op Blood Loss Anemia: On POD 1, She received 2 units pRBCs
for a HCT of 20.  Her INR was also elevated to 1.7 and she
received 2 Units of FFP. Her HCT was stable at 29 and INR
recovered to 1.2.

Post-op UTI: E. coli was found in her urine. She was treated
with Cefepime.
She was discharged home to complete a course of Augmentin to
cover both the urine and the wound culture.
