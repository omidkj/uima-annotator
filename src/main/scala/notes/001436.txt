Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim / IV Dye, Iodine Containing / Albuterol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain w/jaw and L arm pain similar to previous MI;
transferred from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PCI of LAD with bare metal stent placement
complicated placement of 2-way foley requiring cystoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Per pt and OSH records, pt is a 71 y.o. gentleman with
significant CAD hx, s/p MI x 4, RCA stents x 4 (most recent
placed in [**2147**]), COPD, bladder cancer (w/lung mets), who
presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] with chest pain w/jaw and L arm pain
similar to previous MI. Pt had to stop ASA and Plavix 1 month
ago due to ongoing signficant hematuria related to bladder
cancer tx which required blood transfusions and PRN 3 way
irrigation. In this setting, he developed sudden onset chest
pain on [**5-5**], with cough and assoicated retrosternal left sided
pressure with radiation left arm and jaw. Per pt, these sypmtoms
were identical to those that he has experienced in the past when
he had MIs. He immediately called EMS.  EMS called to [**Hospital1 **]
ER where EKG revealed inferior STEMI, bolused with 600mg Plavix
and ASA given. Per pt chest pain resolved in transit. B/c of dye
allergy he was premedicated and then taken to the cath lab. On
cath he was found to have thrombosis of the RCA stent which was
treated with balloon angioplasty in addition to 90% proximal LAD
lesion. LV gram showed LVEF 45-50% with moderate inferior
hypokinesis. Decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI LAD.

.
Of note, pt had slight hematuria yesterday now resolved;
currently urine clear, no evidence of bleeding. Pt had 2
epsiodes of chest pain overnight, responding to sublingual
nitroglycerin, and no EKG changes. On arrival to the floor, pt
feeling well, no chest pain, no difficulty breathing while lying
flat (currently on bed rest b/c of cath), no abdominal pain, no
complaint of LE edema, no SOB. VS were afebrile, 136/87, 81, 93%
on RA.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, hematurea has resolved. No fever, chills,
was in usual state of health prior to chest pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cath Report:

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 71 y.o. gentleman with significant CAD hx, s/p MI x 4,
RCA stents x 4 (most recent placed in [**2147**]), COPD, bladder
cancer (w/lung mets), who presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] with chest
pain w/jaw and L arm pain similar to previous MI. Pt had to stop
ASA and Plavix 1 month ago due to ongoing signficant hematuria
related to bladder cancer tx which required blood transfusions
and PRN 3 way irrigation. On cath he was found to have
thrombosis of the RCA stent which was treated with balloon
angioplasty in addition to 90% proximal LAD lesion. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI of LAD and had hospital course complicated by
hematuria requiring transfusions.
.
# CAD:  Pt has significant CAD hx w/multiple MIs, symptoms of
chest pain/pressure radiating to jaw and arms are identical to
symptoms he's had in past. Got plavix & aspirin from EMS. Cath
at [**Hospital3 1280**] found to have thrombosis of the RCA stent which
was treated with balloon angioplasty in addition to 90% proximal
LAD lesion. Placed BMS b/c of issues with plavix causing
bleeding in setting of bladder cancer (undergoing chemotherapy).
Transferred for PCI of LAD lesion which was successful with
placement of another BMS. Restarted on plavix 75cc, aspirin,
metoprolol. Some question and concern of possible bruit but site
looked good and faint bruits bilateral in setting of significant
vascular disease. Pt was deemed ready for discharge when he
began to have large amount of hematuria which rapidly worsened
and necessitated urology consult and transfer to the CCU (see
below).  Following return from the CCU he remained stable from a
cardiac standpoint.  He should continue aspirin and plavix for
one month.  His atovastatin was increased from 20 mg daily to 80
mg.  Initiation of lisinopril may also be considered as an
outpatient.
.
# Bladder Cancer: Pt has known metastatic bladder cancer (mets
to lung). Has undergone 2 rounds of chemo prior to admission.
Had to be taken off plavix and aspirin b/c he was having
significant hematuria which required multiple transfusions;
bleeding from tumor. After stopping plavix and aspirin
approximately 1-2mo ago, hematuria had resolved completely -- 1
week prior to MI for which pt was admitted. Initially on
admission, urine was clear after cath and pt doing well. On day
he was about to be discharged ([**2154-5-9**]) he acutely developed
significant hematuria requiring blood transfusion, urgent
urology consult for placement of foley for irrigation and
transfer to CCU. He required 3 units of pRBC's.  Placement of
foley was very difficult even with cystoscopy, so patient was
transferred to OR on east for rigid cystoscopy which revealed
1.5 U clotted blood in bladder with no evidence of active bleed
and left bladder metastasis. A 3-way catheter was placed to
allow CBI.  He was started on cefazolin for 3 days
periprocedurally.  His continuous bladder irrigation was later
stopped and the patient's urine remained clear without clots.
