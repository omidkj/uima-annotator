CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elevated LFTs and hyponatremia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 62-year-old male
with a history of AML status post allo-BMT in '[**94**] and recent
hospitalization for pulmonary embolus now presenting status
post right ACL tear, hemarthrosis, and elevated LFTs.
Patient was admitted at the [**Hospital1 188**] with shortness of breath on [**2103-7-18**].  He was
found to have pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis in
his right lower extremity, and atrial fibrillation.  He was
not anticoagulated at the time due to a history of GI bleed
in [**2103-4-15**].  He was cardioverted and started on Rythmol
at the time.  An IVC filter was placed and was started on
Lovenox 80 mg subQ b.i.d.  He then developed a pneumonia, and
was started on antibiotics and D/C'd home on [**2103-7-24**].

Subsequently on [**7-26**], he had a fall at home leading
to a right ACL tear, hemarthrosis, ecchymoses, hypotension,
and was transferred to [**Hospital6 48646**].  He was then
transfused 5 units of packed red blood cells and fresh-frozen
plasma.  He was also noted to be thrombocytopenic,
hyponatremic, and with liver failure with an alkaline
phosphatase of 1300, total bilirubin of 18.5, ALT of 1170,
and AST of 1375.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.7, blood pressure
80/60, heart rate of 98, and 90% on 6 liters.  In general,
the patient is in no acute distress, alert and oriented, but
confused, and an unreliable historian.  HEENT:  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Subconjunctival ecchymoses, icteric conjunctivae.
Oropharynx without ulcers and with petechiae.  Neck
examination:  No lymphadenopathy and no thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination:  S1, S2 tachycardic.  Lung
examination:  Crackles bibasilar with rhonchi.  Abdominal
examination is nontender and nondistended.  Extremities with
lower extremity dermatitis and multiple ecchymoses.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White count 7.7, hematocrit
34.5, platelets 57.  Sodium 121, potassium 3.9, chloride 85,
CO2 24, BUN 28, creatinine 0.7, glucose 128.  PT 12.8, PTT
25.5.  Urinalysis revealed trace protein, otherwise within
normal limits.  ALT 1259, AST 1107, LDH 81, alkaline
phosphatase 1582, calcium 7.9, magnesium 1.9, phosphorus 3.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient's potential hepatotoxic medications
were on hold and his liver function tests trended downwards
towards normal limits.  A GI consult was obtained and
deferred liver biopsy at this time.  The patient continued to
have hypoxia and a large oxygen requirements.  Patient was
empirically started on cefepime for possible recurrent
pneumonia.

Throughout his hospital course, he was noted to have rapid
atrial fibrillation with ventricular responses up to the
190s.  Cardiology consult was obtained and he was started on
a diltiazem drip.  He was transitioned to atenolol p.o. q.d.
and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, elongated left atrium, trace
AR, 1+ MR with small pericardial effusion without signs of
tamponade.  An Infectious Disease consult was obtained for
optimal management of his pneumonia and his antibiotics were
changed to meropenem.  Fungal coverage was also added on
empirically to rule out a fungal process.

His shortness of breath mildly improved over this time, and
his hyponatremia also improved throughout his hospital
course.

On hospital day #10, the patient had an acute episode of
rapid AFib with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and was
subsequently intubated for respiratory failure.  Following
intubation, he became acutely hypotensive and required
synchronized d-c cardioversion which unsuccessfully
cardioverted him, but did decrease his tachycardia to the 100
range.  He was then transported to the Medical ICU, and now
required Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support.  A
bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day #10, which
revealed frothy secretions in his left and right lower lobes.
A BAL was performed on the right middle lobe and lingula and
was therefore subsequently sent for culture.  The BAL
microbiology laboratory results were largely unremarkable
with the exception of [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans in the fungal culture.

A CTA of the chest was performed to rule out recurrent
pulmonary embolism.  This CTA revealed no evidence of
pulmonary embolism, interval development of bilateral pleural
effusions, and was then started on high dosed steroids.

On hospital day #13, the patient was successfully extubated,
but continued to have episodes of atrial fibrillation with
rates in the 150s.  The patient adamantly stated that he no
longer wanted to be intubated and wanted to no longer having
oral suctioning.  Despite extubation, the patient continued
to have a profound hypoxia as well as continued episodes of
rapid atrial fibrillation leading to tachypnea despite a
diltiazem drip.  Amiodarone was added for attempted rhythm
and rate control, but despite these medications, the patient
continued to experience tachypnea.

By hospital day #15, the patient's condition continued to
deteriorate and at 10:20 p.m., the covering resident was
called to see the patient for asystole and absence of
respirations and was declared dead at 10:20 p.m.  The family
agreed to an autopsy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Respiratory failure.
2. Atrial fibrillation.
3. Acute myelogenous leukemia status post allogeneic bone
marrow transplant.
4. Recurrent pulmonary emboli.
5. Right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
6. Status post gastrointestinal bleed.
7. Cytomegalovirus colitis.
8. Graft-versus-host disease.
