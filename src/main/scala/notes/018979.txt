Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-12-13**] Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease
aortic valve bioprosthesis (model number 3300TFX,serial number
[**Serial Number 57326**]).


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old male with known
aortic stenosis who recently experienced syncopal episode while
in Britian. Up until that point, he has been relatively
asymptomatic. He admits though that he does not overexert
himself
because he is afraid to. He currently denies chest pain,
exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, dizziness and pedal edema.
He
remains modestly active, walking everyday without symptoms. He
also continues to travel extensively. Given that serial
echocardiograms have shown progressive aortic stenosis, he has
been referred for surgical evaluation.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**Known lastname 3082**].

POST-BYPASS:

Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intcat thoracic aorta.
The bioprosthesis in the aortic position is stable and
functioning well with peak and mean gradient of 12 and 4 mm of
Hg.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2108-12-13**] where
the patient underwent aortic valve replacement.  See operative
report for full details.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  The patient developed post-operative
atrial fibrillation which was managed with beta blocker and
coumadin.  EP consulted and recommended not starting amiodarone
due to a prolonged PR and RBBB.  The patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4, the patient deconditioned, but ambulating, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
