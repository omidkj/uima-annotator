Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: Likely from COPD exacerbation as has had many in the
past requiring hospitalization.  Initially required ICU stay
(<24 hours) though did not require NIV or intubation.  Started
on steroids and levofloxacin, along with nebulizers, singulair,
advair.  Patient was transferred to the floor where her symptoms
continued to improve.  She was discharged on her home regimen
with the addition of levaquin 500mg daily x 3 days and
prednisone 40 mg po daily.  Plan to follow up with primary care
provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] the following week.  At this time prednisone
course will be addressed.

2. Weight loss:  Patient reports significant weight loss in
recent months.  She appears cachectic and malnourished.  She
denies any dysphagia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or loss of
appetite, limited access to food that would be contributing to
her symptoms.  She believes her weight loss is primary due to
her being "too picky".  She also states that her recent dyspnea
has prevented her from eating.  She refuses all supplemental
shakes.  Nutrition was consulted.  Patient was counseled on
stategies to maintain a high calorie diet.  As patient's
respiratory status improved her caloric intake increased.
Recommend regular weight check and possibly outpatient nutrition
counseling.

3. Gastritis:  History of prior ulcer (EGD [**2206-2-5**]); started on
PPI while on steroids.

4. CAD:  Continued statin/plavix.
