CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old male with
history of coronary artery disease and diabetes, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, who presented with left lower extremity
redness and swelling with pain.  He has had a chronic
swelling and intermittent left lower extremity pain for
months, but the erythema is new.  He started with a spot on
his medial calf last evening and progressed to diffuse very
tender erythema with petechiae in the entire left leg.  He is
able to walk with severe pain.  He denies any trauma.  He has
no fevers, chills, night sweats, chest pain, anginal
equivalent, PND, or orthopnea.  He may have accidentally
kicked the furniture with his leg.  He has no respiratory or
GI complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post three vessel CABG in
[**2105**].  Exercise treadmill test in '[**10**] showed severe apical
inferior reversible defects, an EF of 46%.
2. History of GI bleed secondary to peptic ulcer disease.
3. Prostate cancer status post XRT complicated by rectal
bleeding.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation without anticoagulation due
to GI bleed.
5. Fatty liver by ultrasound with normal LFTs in [**2116-11-2**].

ALLERGIES:
1. Aspirin - GI bleed.
2. Penicillin - rash.
3. Erythromycin, Biaxin, and sulfa - unknown reactions.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Digoxin 0.25 q.d.
2. Toprol XL 100 q.d.
3. Lasix 40 q.d.
4. Aldactone 25 q.d.
5. Glyburide 2.5 q.d.
6. Lipitor 5 q.d.
7. Zantac 75 h.s.
8. Tylenol.
9. Sublingual nitroglycerin prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
quit tobacco 35 years ago.  He does not drink.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Shows that the mother had coronary artery
disease at 74 and father had coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's physical exam showed
temperature of 94 in ED triage rising to 96 on admission to
the ED, pulse of 79, blood pressure 105/33, respiratory rate
of 23, and sat of 96% on room air.  Blood sugar was 196.  In
general, he was in no distress.  He was anicteric.  HEENT
examination was otherwise negative.  He had no JVD, no
lymphadenopathy.  His lungs had crackles [**1-6**] of the way up.
He had a normal S1, S2 and a [**1-9**] holosystolic murmur.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, tympanitic.  Right lower
extremity showed increased edema.  Left lower extremity
showed marked erythema with petechiae, pain, no lesions were
seen as a portal for cellulitis.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count of 16.2 with 79
neutrophils and 17 bands, a hematocrit of 43.7, 225
platelets.  Chem-7 was notable for creatinine of 1.4, up from
1.3 at baseline, lactate was 4.1, glucose was 222.  ABG
showed pH of 7.43, CO2 of 27, and oxygen of 109.

Because of the patient's vital signs, and his bandemia, and
elevated lactate, he was admitted to the ICU for sepsis
protocol.  He was initially treated with Cipro and
clindamycin before blood cultures were performed, and he was
given several liters of fluid in the ED for blood pressure
that dropped to 95 with a heart rate of 50s-60s while he was
beta blocked.

The initial concern was for necrotizing fasciitis.  He was
evaluated by Surgery, who felt that he would not need
emergent debridement, but he was monitored for
decompensation, which did not occur.  He had a CT of his leg
which showed no free air.  Vancomycin was initially added for
concern for MRSA.  This was later discontinued and he was
kept on clindamycin and Cipro alone.  Patient was oxygenating
well despite his CHF on examination, and he was given only
gentle fluids initially.

He was followed by Surgery in the ICU.  His cellulitis
improved on antibiotics of cefazolin and Cipro.  He was
continued on his routine heart failure medications.  He was
felt to be hypovolemic despite his crackles and was given
more IV fluid repletion due to his picture of sepsis.  He
remained hemodynamically stable, and was transferred to the
floor on the 16th.

The only notable events in the ICU were a new T-wave
inversion in V2 and V3 and a peak CK of 369 with a troponin
of 0.6 felt to be consistent with demand ischemia.  On the
floor, he continued his antibiotics, and his cellulitis
continued to be improving.  He was seen by Physical Therapy,
who cleared him for discharge home.  However, he had
worsening diarrhea.  Clostridium difficile was sent and was
negative.

He, however, had difficulty with worsening CHF on the evening
of the 17th and 18th.  His diuresis was increased requiring
40 b.i.d. IV Lasix.  He had repeat EKG and troponins, which
were negative for new ischemia at that time.  The cause of
his CHF exacerbation was felt to be the fluids he received
for diarrhea and for sepsis originally.  He was given a
slightly lower dose of his beta blocker, and continued on his
statin, and digoxin, and aldactone.

Patient was seen by Occupational Therapy, who felt that he
had a borderline requirement for rehab stay, however, given
his relatively tenuous CHF status and medication balancing,
he was felt to be someone who would benefit from a short
rehab stay, which was arranged for [**2116-11-21**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Left lower extremity cellulitis complicated by sepsis and
mild hypotension.
2. Congestive heart failure due to volume overload.
3. History of GI bleed preventing aspirin and anticoagulation
use.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Will be updated on the time of his
departure on the 20th.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Ipratropium nebulizers or MDIs q.4h. prn.
2. Albuterol nebulizer or MDI q.4h. prn.
3. Metoprolol XL 50 q.d.
4. Losartan 25 q.d.
5. Guaifenesin [**4-11**] mL p.o. q.6h. prn.
6. Spironolactone 25 q.d.
7. Glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Cefazolin 1 gram IV q.12h. to be converted to a 14 day
total duration of antibiotics with Keflex on departure from
acute rehab.
9. Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.
11. Protonix 40 mg q.d.
12. Lipitor 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
13. Lasix dose to be determined but likely 80 mg b.i.d.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Followup should be with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**]
and the patient's cardiologist.  Patient's daily weight must
be monitored and his Lasix may need to be increased if his
weight increases.  Saturations must also be closely followed
with his respiratory rate and physical exam.  He should
consume a 2-gram sodium cardiac diet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Full code, but this spares clarification
with the patient.
