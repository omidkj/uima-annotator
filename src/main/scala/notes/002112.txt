unclear history of heart failure who p/w worsening LE edema,

#Dyspnea - Patient was found to have elevated WBC and RLL
opacity concerning for pneumonia.  He was treated with
levofloxacin and CTX.  He initially required supplemental oxygen
and Bipap, but was quickly weaned to room air and called out of
the MICU. He was ruled out for an MI.  TTE showed  Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated aortic root and
ascending aorta (EF 60-70%).  Patient was not dyspneic on the
floor, and did not require supplemental O2.  He finished a 5 day
course of levofloxacin for possible CAP.  His dyspnea is thought
to be secondary to Obesity Hypoventilation syndrome.

and CK elevation continued to trend down slowly.  At discharge
his Cr was 1..4 and his CK was 3208.  Possible etiology of CK
elevation include medication, overdiuresis, and lying in one
position for may hours at rehab.
