History of Present Illness:
On admission:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female who began having
intermittant generalized abdominal pain about 4 days ago. She
had some mild nausea and one episode of small volume emesis, but
she attributes this to her vertigo. Today, her pain increased a
great deal, and became quite sharp and constant and unbearable
to the point that she was crying at home. She was brought to the
ED by EMS for evaluation. Her last BM was earlier today and was
normal. She denies fever
and chills. She does have anorexia, but she says this has been
going on for some months.

Pertinent Results:
[**2101-5-12**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Pneumoperitoneum with bowel perforation better
assessed on CT
abdomen/pelvis performed within the same hour. Large left
diaphragmatic
hernia. Right lung base bronchiectasis may be related to chronic
aspiration.
.
[**2101-5-12**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Findings suggest bowel perforation, likely from the region of
the
pylorus/first portion of the duodenum where there is
circumferential wall
thickening and apparent small rent through the anterior wall.
This causes
large pneumoperitoneum and mild-to-moderate ascites.
2. Large, stomach- and colon-containing left diaphragmatic
hernia.
3. Peripheral ground- glass opacities in the right lower lobe
concerning for aspiration.
4. Few scattered sigmoid colonic diverticulae, without definite
diverticulitis, thus making this less likely cause for bowel
perforation.

Brief Hospital Course:
*)Duodenal Ulcer
She was taken to the operating room, where a 4mm defect in the
pyloroduodenal area was noted. The defect was repaired and
reinforced with an omental patch; please see the operative
report for full details. Her diet was slowly advanced and on
discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, albeit with the
same decreased appetite she had had for several months as
reported on admission.
.
*)Tachycardia
Her post-operative course was complicated by tachycardia, which
was initially thought to be atrial fibrillation. Cardiology was
consulted and felt that it may be multi-focal tachycardia. She
had been on verapamil as an outpatient, but was started on
diltiazem during her hospitalization for acute rate control.
This was maintained, as verapamil was noted to be more
constipating. On discharge her heartrate was well controlled on
diltiazem.
.
*)Cellulitis
On POD#5 erythema was noted at the site of a prior infiltrated
IV on her left arm. The area was marked and appeared to grow in
size; vancomycin was started with subsequent improvement of the
erythema. She was discharged on a course of Bactrim to complete
7 days of antibiotics, per ID curbside recommendations.
.
*)Disposition
Physical therapists worked with her during her hospital course
and recommended further therapy after discharge. She was
discharged to a rehabilitation facility to continue her
post-operative recovery. Her home medications, with the
exception of verapamil, were re-started shortly after surgery
and were continued during her hospital course.
