Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 76 yo F with multiple medical problems including
CAD, systolic CHF who presented with urosepsis and
pyelonephritis. She was admitted to the ICU, where she was
treated with fluid resuscitation and broad spectrum antibiotics
for urosepsis. On the floor, she continued to improve.

She was discharged on day 6 of hospital stay with followup with
her primary care provider.
.
# E. Coli urinary sepsis: Urine culture and 2 blood cultures
positive for e. coli, sensitive to both ceftriaxone and
ciprofloxacin. She had a CVL which was never used, nor did she
ever require pressors. TEE was negative for valvular vegetations
(patient has bioprosthetic aortic valve and multiple surgeries
for pacemaker). ID was consulted and recommended a 2 week course
of antibiotics (one week IV ceftriaxone, one week PO
ciprofloxacin.

#Pyelonephritis: Patient presented with CVA tenderness and
became febrile on ICU day 2. UCx preliminarily identified as E.
coli, on ceftriaxone. Pt also complained of bladder pain with
Foley and pyridium was given to alleviate pain. According to
records, she does not have a history of drug-resistant UTIs. Pt
left the ICU on ceftriaxone, which was continued on the floor.

#CHF, EF35%: Pt had no evidence of decompensation upon
admission. She was given PRN boluses to maintain MAP>64 and UOP
remained adequate. Pt's home metoprolol was initially held but
restarted on day 2 as BP continued to be stable throughout the
day. Pt's O2 saturations remained adequate while in the unit.
TTE was done, but image quality was inadequate to evaluate for
valvular vegetation. Of note, it showed LVEF 30-35%. A follow-up
TTE was negative for any valvular or pacemaker vegetations.

# [**Last Name (un) **] / Hyponatremia: Initially found to be at 127. This was
most consistent with hypovolemic hyponatremia as patient's
BUN/Cr was more consistent with [**Last Name (un) **] with prerenal azotemia .
After receiving NS IVF, sodium normalized to 134 and creatine
went to baseline.
