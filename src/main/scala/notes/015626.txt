HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old
gentleman who was recently diagnose with severe AS.
Preoperatively he had been started by a cardiologist in
[**State 108**] on amiodarone and Lasix when he was found to be in
congestive heart failure.  He then underwent an
echocardiogram which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy
and an ejection fraction of 45% to 50% with severe AF and
calculate an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm squared with a peak
gradient across the aortic valve of 54 mmHg.  There was
moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation.  He then underwent
cardiac catheterization which estimated his ejection fraction
at 35% to 40%.  He had 100% occlusion of the non dominant
right coronary artery, mildly elevated left sided filling
pressures with mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy
3.  Type II diabetes mellitus diet controlled
4.  Hypercholesterolemia
5.  History of rheumatic fever
6.  Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower
extremity claudication
7.  Arthritis

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bilateral cataract surgeries
2.  Bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy
3.  Bilateral carpal tunnel release
4.  T&A

MEDICATIONS PREOPERATIVE:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg po qd
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg po qd
3.  Lipitor 10 mg po qd
4.  Lasix 20 mg po qd
5.  Zestril 10 mg po qd
6.  Vitamins B, C, E, A and D

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father is deceased at age 87 from
cerebrovascular accident and mother deceased at age [**Age over 90 **]
secondary to CA.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is retired and has a remote history of
heavy tobacco use, but states he quit more than 20 years ago.

Preoperatively, he had differential blood pressures in the
right arm 120/50, left arm 170/60.  Heart rate was 59 and
sinus and his weight was 128 pounds.  The patient had a 3/6
systolic ejection murmur that radiated to the neck.  He had
palpable femoral pulses bilaterally.  DPs were not palpable.
PTs palpable only on the left.  Radial pulses palpable
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent AVR and coronary
artery bypass graft x1, saphenous vein graft to distal RCA
with a 23 mm pericardial valve.  Operative course was
unremarkable and the patient was transferred to the cardiac
surgery recovery in intubated and good condition.
Postoperatively, the patient was on a small amount of Neo for
blood pressure support that was weaned on postoperative day
#1.  He was extubated successfully, but was confused and self
discontinued his chest tube on postoperative day #2.  He was
also started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

A neurologic consult was obtained for his confusion.
Additionally, he had a slight bump in his creatinine to a
peak of 1.7 that improved over the next several days.
Additionally, he was seen by the EPS service and the
amiodarone was continued, as well as anticoagulation.  The
patient continued to require pulmonary toilets and on the
evening of postoperative day #3, decompensated from a
respiratory standpoint requiring reintubation.  The patient
was started on vancomycin for coagulase negative
Staphylococcus bacteremia secondary to line infection.  Line
was removed and in light of the new valve, the patient was
continued on vancomycin.

The patient was cardioverted by the cardiology staff on [**3-24**]
which was postoperative day #7 and was converted to normal
sinus rhythm.  Additionally, the patient had a pacemaker
placed.  It is a DDD pacer.  The patient was continued
throughout this course on a slow vent wean.  Tube feeds were
started.

On postoperative day #9, a chest tube was placed on the right
for a right sided pleural effusion.  The patient underwent
bronchoscopy revealing only moderate white clear secretions
consistent with tracheobronchitis.  The patient did develop
diarrhea with multiple Clostridium difficile negative
throughout his hospital course.  This was thought to be
secondary to his tube feeds and since resolved.

On postoperative day #12, white blood cell count increased
dramatically from 14 to 29.  Infectious disease consult was
obtained at this point.  The patient has had echocardiograms
that did not demonstrate any endocarditis of his prosthetic
valve.  The patient's white blood cell count gradually
improved and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was
cultured from the sputum.  The patient continued to improve.
He had a PICC line placed on [**2188-3-31**].  The patient's vent
was weaned.  He was re-bronched on [**2188-4-3**] which revealed
resolving tracheobronchitis.  He was extubated on [**2188-4-3**]
successfully and received aggressive chest PT.  His mental
status continued to improve along with his pulmonary status.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**4-11**], continuing
to improve.  His INR was elevated to 4.3.  His Coumadin was
temporarily.  His INR came back to 1.8 the following day and
his Coumadin was restarted on a lower dose.  The patient
failed a video swallow study and had a PEG placed on [**4-10**].
The patient was seen by PT and felt to benefit from
rehabilitation.  The patient continued to improve on the
floor.  He remained afebrile with vital signs stable.  His
diarrhea had improved.  He is being discharged to
rehabilitation.

On exam, his lungs are clear.  His heart is regular.  His
wound is clean, dry and intact.  His sternum is stable.  His
abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  His extremities
are warm with no edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg per G-tube [**Hospital1 **]
2.  Lasix 20 mg per G-tube qd
3.  KCL 20 milliequivalents po qd
4.  Coumadin 1 mg po qd

His INR on [**2188-4-13**] was 2.7 and INR on [**4-14**] is still
pending.  His INRs will need to be checked regularly at
rehabilitation and his Coumadin dose adjusted.  His Coumadin
was for atrial fibrillation with goal INR of 2 to 2.5.
Vancomycin 500 mg intravenous qd.  His peak level is 18.8.
His trough is still pending.  Prevacid 30 mg per G-tube qd.
Digoxin 0.125 mg per G-tube qd.  Tylenol 650 mg per G-tube
q4h prn.  Ibuprofen elixir 400 mg per G-tube q6h prn.
Multivitamin elixir 5 mg per G-tube qd.  Aspirin 325 mg per
G-tube qd.  Captopril 25 mg per G-tube tid.  Amiodarone 400
mg per G-tube qd.

He is on receiving 5 units of NPH insulin subcutaneously [**Hospital1 **].
Additionally, he is on a regular insulin sliding scale with
fingersticks q6h.  He receives 3 units for blood sugars
between 150 and 200, 6 units for blood sugars between 200 and
250, 9 units for blood sugars between 251 and 300 and 12
units for blood sugars greater than 300 for which [**Name8 (MD) **] M.D.
should be called.  The patient is also receiving tube feeds
of ProMod with fiber at 65 cc per hour which is at goal.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is being discharged to
rehabilitation in good condition.  He will need follow up
swallow evaluation before being allowed to take po's.
Additionally, he will need his INR checked regularly and his
Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly.
