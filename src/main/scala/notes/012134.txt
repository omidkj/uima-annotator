Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right renal artey embolization [**2110-9-9**]
Thoracentesis [**2110-9-15**]
Arterial line placement


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 yo male with DM, CRI, dementia, CVA, seizure
disorder, and recent MVA who was originally transferred from an
OSH for a right perinephric hematoma which he suffered from a
twisting motion while getting out of bed.  He was originally
admitted to trauma surgery where he had an embolization of one
of the branches of the right renal artery done by IR.  His
hematocrit remained stable.
.
His course was complicated by a worsening pleural effusion
thought to be [**2-6**] lymphatic tracking originating from the
perinephric space.  A therapeutic tap of 1500mL of
serosanguinous fluid was done because he desaturated to 89% on
RA.  Other complications include elevated troponins to 0.22 with
normal CK and CKMB, and new TWI in V1-V3.  No report of chest
pain.
.
Then he was admitted to the MICU for mental status change.  He
remained hemodynamically stable and is now transferred to the
regular floors for further management.

Past Medical History:
1) Diabetes type 2
2) HTN
3) CRI (baseline 2.4),
4) CHF
5) CVA
6) Seizure disorder on Keppra,
7) Emphysema

Social History:
Lives with wife, had apparently been doing all ADL's with good
independence before admission. No alcohol use since [**2106**] stroke,
only drank socially before then. No tobacco or illicit drug use.

Used to work as chemist.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) 2280**], mother with PMR, cousin with epilepsy

at bases.

Ext: No edema
Neurol: AOx2, not cooperative with neuro exam.  Toes mute.


Pertinent Results:
[**9-17**] Head CT: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Large area of encephalomalacia in the region of the right
posterior cerebral artery territory, secondary to an old
infarct. No CT evidence to suggest acute major vascular
territorial infarction, though if clinical suspicion is high for
this entity, MRI would be more a superior diagostic imaging
study. Other findings, as noted above.
.
[**9-18**] CXR: Persistent severe pulmonary edema with pleural
effusions.
.
[**9-19**] CXR: Diffuse mild hydrostatic edema. Linear right
infrahilar opacity is likely anterior segment right upper lobe
atelectasis. Continued surveillance recommended. Stable right
pleural effusion. Left lower lobe collapse also evident.
.
[**9-19**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D  or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with  normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are  normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The aortic valve  leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild  (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation  is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate  pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic  pericardial
effusion.
.
[**9-23**] EEG: Abnormal EEG due to a diffusely slowed record with two

distinct patterns of slowing seen suggesting a moderate to
moderately
severe diffuse encephalopathy. No discharging features were
seen.
.
[**9-23**] CXR: Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, left lower lobe
atelectasis, and moderate pulmonary edema have all worsened
since [**9-20**]. Cardiac silhouette has enlarged in the
interim, but not appreciably. No pneumothorax. Transvenous right
atrial and right ventricular pacer leads unchanged in their
respective positions. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by telephone at the time of dictation.
.
[**9-27**] CT chest: 1. Large bilateral pleural effusions and
compressive atelectasis of the majority of the lower lobes of
both lungs. Underlying infectious process within the atelectatic
lung cannot be entirely excluded. Pleural effusions are not
significantly changed in degree from [**2110-9-1**].
2. Subcapsular hemorrhage of the right kidney undergoing
expected evolution but not changed insize from [**9-8**].
Embolization coils are noted near the renal hilum. If the
patient is hypertensive, this may represent a Page kidney.
3. Left upper pole renal cyst with amorphous, but [**Known lastname **]
calcifications, not entirely simple in appearance. Further
evaluation with ultrasound (patient has a pacemeaker) is
recommended as this lesion was not entirely imaged on this
study.
4. Coronary artery calcifications and calcifications of the
aorta.
