CXR ([**2143-6-29**]): Moderate congestive heart failure. Endotracheal
tube in
satisfactory position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

DIALYSIS CATHETER placement ([**2143-7-3**] ):
1.  Successful placement of a 27-cm tip-to-cuff length,
14.5-French dual lumen tunneled hemodialysis catheter via the
left subclavian vein.  The tip is in the right atrium and ready
for use.
2.  Limited ultrasound examination of both internal jugular
veins showed tight stenosis near the level of the clavicles
bilaterally.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT) ([**2143-7-5**]):
Patent bilateral cephalic and basilic veins with diameters as
noted above.  The brachial arteries are diseased bilaterally
with monophasic waveforms.

MIBI scan ([**2143-7-8**]):
1. Abnormal myocardial perfusion study showing a moderate sized,

severe, predominantly reversible defect of the inferolateral
wall.  2. Compared with the prior study of [**2139-11-27**] the defect
is both larger in area and more pronounced.  3.  The EF has
decreased from 46% ([**2139-11-27**]) to today's value of 35%.

Cardiac cath ([**2143-7-9**]):
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the mid RCA instent restenosis with a
3.0x32mm
Taxus stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
54 year old male with CAD s/p RCA stent, diastolic CHF, ESRD
nearing HD presented with acute CHF likely from hypertensive
emergency and subendocardial ischemia. Pt left the hospital AMA.

1. Cardiac
a. Coronaries: likely diffuse subendocardial ischemia. NSTEMI
unlikely. Was cathed and stented mid RCA instent restenosis. was
continued on aspirin and plavix.

b. pump:
h/o diastolic dysfxn. Had pulmonary edema, hypoxia requiring
100% FiO2 on admission. Improved significantly with dialysis and
CVVH. O2 requirements trended down. Was on room air.

c. Rhythm: baseline incomplete LBBB that was complete on
admission likely secondary to LV strain from hypertension. Now
again with incomplete LBBB as BP has been better controlled.

2. ESRD: pt with baseline cr [**4-27**]. Was uremic with metabolic
acidosis on admission. Now metabolically better. received
calcium acetate for hyperphosphatemia. was on epoeitin. has
outpt dialysis set up for qTueThurSat at [**Hospital1 1474**] dialysis. dr
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 90386**]) will be the nephrologist there.

3. ID: Sputum culture positive for MSSA. Was started on
oxacillin x10days. blood cultures did not show any growth. was
also HbcAb +ve, HCV Ab +ve. LFTs were normal.

4. Anemia: Hct was 31 on the last day. had received blood
transfusion on the day before the discharge.

5.FEN: cardiac healthy diet

6.proph: was on heparin sc, PPI

7.contacts: sister [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102883**]. Mother [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 102884**]

8.Code status: Full code

9.Dispo: patient left hospital against medical advice. We
advised him that this could be dangerous to his life. We also
tried to give him the discharge paperwork. He was supposed to be
seen by transplant surgery for placement of an AV fistula.
