SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote tobacco and no alcohol.  Lives at

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature was 100.5,
blood pressure 114/102, heart rate 98, respiratory rate 28,
sating 99% on four liters nasal cannula.  In general she was
awake and alert times 2.5 and mild respiratory distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Lip smacking was noted.
Oropharynx was clear with dry mucous membranes.  Lungs:
Decreased breath sounds on the right.  No crackles.  Also had
bronchial breath sounds on the right.  Cardiovascular
examination was normal.  Abdominal examination had a
reducible, nontender, ventral hernia.  Belly was soft with
normal bowel sounds, mild tenderness to palpation on the
right side without guarding.  Extremities:  Edema of
bilateral lower extremities.

LABORATORY FINDINGS:  White count 19 with 95% neutrophils, 0
bands, 3 lymphocyte.  Hematocrit 38.4, platelet count 264.
Chem 7 with creatinine of 1.4.  Prothrombin time of 15, PTT
of 31.6, INR 1.5. Lactate on admission was 2.8.  Urinalysis
showed moderate leukocyte esterase, positive nitrates, 21 to
50 white blood cells and moderate bacteria.  CT of the chest
and abdomen showed no pulmonary embolus, right lung
consolidation, no hepatobiliary pathology except gallstones,
multiple bilateral simple renal cysts.  Stable right adrenal
mass and a ventral hernia.  KUB was unremarkable.
Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 89, normal axis
and intervals and no changes from [**2181**].

ASSESSMENT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with multiple
medical problems who presents with shortness of breath and
hypoxia and right sided flank and abdominal pain in mild
respiratory distress.  Imaging with a right lung
consolidation.  Additionally urinalysis also indicates
possible urinary tract infection with concern for
pyelonephritis as a possible additional cause of her right
flank pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Pulmonary issues including right lower lobe
consolidation, respiratory failure, new endobronchial lesion.
On admission imaging showed right lower lobe consolidation
concerning for possible aspiration pneumonia verses a post
obstructive process.  The patient was initially admitted to
the General Medicine Service and she was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics of Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Given the concern for possible post obstructive pneumonia the
Pulmonary service was consulted, they performed a flexible
bronchoscopy on [**2187-4-6**] notable for a polypoid lesion
obstructing the right lower lobe.  Brushings were done and
sent for cytology but no biopsy was done at that time given
the patient's elevated INR.  Over the first several days of
her hospital course the patient's O2 requirement continued to
increase and she remained extremely tachypneic in the 20 to
30's.  She was tried on CPAP but did not tolerate it.  Then
on [**2187-4-7**] she developed increasing respiratory distress
complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.  Further complicated by hypotension.  The night
intern and resident were called to see the patient at which
point her vital signs included a heart rate in the 140's,
blood pressure 82/palp, respiratory rate 28, sating 91% on
six liters which improved to 99% on non-rebreather.  Her
arterial blood gas was consistent with acute respiratory
acidosis and given her hypoxia and progressive hypercarbic
respiratory failure secondary to fatigue the patient was
electively intubated and transferred to the Intensive care
unit.

While in the Intensive care unit sputum cultures became
positive for Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
the patient is being continued on a 14 day course of
Vancomycin.  Additionally she was continued on the
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for possible gram negative rods and
anaerobes as a result of her post obstructive pneumonia
although sputum gram stain and cultures have only been
positive for gram positive cocci.  She will be given a 7 day
course of these antibiotics as well.  After intubation the
patient did well, and self-extubated on the night of the
24th.  After extubation the patient clearly stated she did
not wish to be re-intubated and did not wish to be
resuscitated in the event of cardiac arrest.  Therefore, she
was continued on supplemental O2 and has continued to sat
well on 5 liters nasal cannula with stable ventilatory status
at this point although she is still tachypneic.

The cytology brushings of her bronchoscopy were negative for
malignant cells on preliminary report.  The patient does not
wish to have any further workup at this time of this
endobronchial lesion and is not interested in pursuing a
diagnosis.

Arrhythmia.  The night of intubation the patient had an
episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response complicated by hypotension that responded well to 5
mg of Metoprolol intravenous.  She had no further episodes of
atrial fibrillation.  However, while in the Intensive care
unit she did have one episode of supraventricular tachycardia
which also responded well to Metoprolol.  She has been
restarted on p.o. Metoprolol to both control her heart rate
as well as to control her blood pressure.

Anemia.  The patient was noted to have hematocrit in the low
30's iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic
disease and the patient did not require transfusions while
she was in house.

Elevated INR.  The patient came in with an INR of 1.5 most
likely secondary to nutritional deficit in combination with
the Levofloxacin.  She was given Vitamin K and had no
evidence of bleeding while in house.

Hypertension.  On admission to the Intensive care unit the
patient had trouble with hypotension and her blood pressure
medicines were held.  She has since been restarted on
Metoprolol with good effect.

The patient's other medical problems namely her
osteoarthritis and anxiety were stable while she was in the
hospital and she was continued on her Fentanyl patch and
Percocet as well as Ativan.

Code status and Communication:  Initially the night the
patient was intubated she was extremely uncomfortable in her
breathing and did agree to the intubation.  Discussions with
her family indicated that they felt that she would want to be
resuscitated in the event of cardiac arrest.  However, after
the patient self-extubated on the night of the
