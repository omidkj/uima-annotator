Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Closed head injury with Right SDH and EDH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tacheotomy [**2130-11-28**]
PEG tube placement [**2130-11-28**]


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 87708**] is a 72 yo woman with a PMH significant for A-fib
(on warfarin in the past but not since [**2130-6-1**]), DM type 2,
asthma and an undetermined hematologic condition, for which she
apparently has received chemo and for which she has
thrombocytopenia.

She was recently admitted to [**Hospital6 5016**] with a UTI.
She was discharged to home and was getting out of her car when
she fell backwards and struck the back of her head. She was
taken back to [**Hospital3 **] where a head CT showed a Right
extraaxial bleed, likely a SDH. She was given 10 of vitamin K
and 2 units of FFP (for unclear reasons). She was then
transferred here.

CT Head [**11-16**]
 right subdural hematoma over fronto-parietal convextiy up to
1.4 cm in
thickness. no significant midline shift. small SDH along
anterior falx

CT C spine [**11-16**]
 no acute fracture or malalignment

CT Head [**11-16**]
Interval increase in size and extent of the right parietal
extra-axial
collection, in a configuration concerning for epidural (or
combined epidural and subdural) hematoma. This now measures 18
mm in greatest depth, previously 14 mm, with a 6-mm deep
component, spanning approximately 6 cm, previously 4.5 cm. No
new or impending herniation.

CT Head [**11-17**]
Overall stable appearance of right parietal collection,
concerning for epidural or combined epidural/subdural hematoma
with possible foci of subarachnoid extension. Stable small
subdural hemorrhage along the anterior falx.

CT Head [**11-18**]
No significant short-interval changes. Large, but stable right
extra-axial hemorrhage, with minimal subarachnoid extension. No
intraventricular hemorrhagic extension. No new foci of
intracranial
hemorrhage. No developing hydrocephalus

CT Head [**11-19**]
Stable right extra-axial hemorrhage, with little change since
the
prior study. Minimal subarachnoid extension and a small area of
subdural
hematoma along the anterior right falx is unchanged. Small
amount of layering hemorrhage within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is
also unchanged. No new acute hemorrhage.

MRI brain [**2130-11-20**]
1. Enlarging lenticular extra-axial collection along the right
frontoparietal convexity. This likely represent an epidural
hematoma which is enlarging.
2. Slightly enlarging subdural hematoma along the right
frontotemporoparietal convexity. Subarachnoid blood products in
the right frontal and parietal sulci are more extensive on MRI
than they have been on prior CT with edema involving the
adjacent gyri.
3. Bilateral intraventricular blood products layering in the
occipital horns. Overall, the ventricular size has not changed
dramatically since the prior study of four days earlier, and
there is no new hydrocephalus.
4. Evidence of underlying chronic small vessel ischemic disease
within the
white matter of both hemispheres.

EEG [**11-21**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study due to the
presence of
mild generalized background slowing and focal attenuation over
the right
fronto-central region. The background slowing is consistent with
mild
encephalopathy, which can be caused by toxic-metabolic
derangement,
infection or medications

[**11-24**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of extra-axial hematoma with no
new associated mass effect. brain infarction, MRI is more
sensitive for detection of this pathological process.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is somewhat less distinct
grey-white
matter differentiation in the right cerebral hemisphere,
compared to the prior CT study, which could indicate persistent,
subarchnoid blood products (seen on the prior MR study), and
possibly an admixture of minimal brain edema.

[**Date range (1) 41989**] EEG:
Negative for seizures

CXR [**2130-11-26**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the
endotracheal
tube is just 1.5 cm away from the carina. The tube should be
pulled back by approximately 1 cm.
The other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly, unchanged mild left basal
atelectasis. No
pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia

CXR [**2130-11-28**]
Mild atelectasis persists at both lung bases. Upper lungs clear.
Borderline cardiomegaly unchanged. ET tube, with the chin
elevated is only 25 mm above the carina and should be withdrawn
2 cm for optimal placement. Left PIC line ends in the region of
the superior cavoatrial junction just beyond the right
supraclavicular central venous line that ends in the SVC. Heart
size top normal, unchanged. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to neurosurgery service and the ICU
for q1 neurochecks and strict blood pressure control to less
than 140. She was given 1 unit of platelets for her
thrombocytopenia and repeat laboratory studies showed increase
in platelet count to 82,000 consistent with goal platelet count
greater than 80,000. On admission she was placed in cervical
collar for C spine precautions. Her cervical collar was removed
on [**11-16**] when CT C spine showed no fracture or malalignment and
she had no c spine tenderness to palpation. A repeat CT head on
the morning of [**11-16**] showed slight increase in size of right
sided subdural hematoma and she remained in the ICU for further
care including q1 neurochecks.

On [**11-17**], patient was noted to have increased expressive
aphasia. Repeat head CT done at 1am showed redistribution of
blood. On examination, patient was a&ox3 with prompting and 5-/5
weakness noted in the LUE, otherwise full throughout. Her
platelet count was stable at 89. A repeat head CT at 1pm was
stable. On [**11-18**], patient was noted to be less interactive and
more dysarthric. Her chin was shaking and she was thought to be
experiencing seizures, her Keppra was increased to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].
An CT, MRI and EEG were ordered to further investigate. On
[**11-19**],
