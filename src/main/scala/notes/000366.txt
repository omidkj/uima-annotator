Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76 year old man with history of CAD (4V CABG [**2166**]),
sternotomy/MRSA infection, flap, T2DM, COPD, recently diagnosed
smal cell lung CA in RUL, presented with 2 day history of pus
draining from bronchoscopy/mediastinoscopy wound, fever to 99.4,
and change in mental status.
.
1. fever: This presentation is similar to his prior presentation
two weeks earlier.  Fever's source this time is presumed to be
an infected wound, given the pus drainage.  Wound and blood
cultures were taken immediately in the ED, and he was started on
IV vanco, given his MRSA history.  Shortly after, a purulent
material was expressed from his sternal wound during
exploration; one minute after this, the patient was noted by his
wife to "turn red all over", becoming tachypneic and tachycardic
to the 130's, and with notable and new, diffuse wheezing.  An
ECG was obtained which showed an SVT at 143, with lateral ST
depressions.  Patient had received IV vanco previously without
incident.  He was admitted to MICU for close monitoring.  MICU
staff felt it was unlikely to be Redman syndrome, and more
likely a transient episode of bacteremia caused by wound
exploration or an anxiety attack.  IV vancomycin was continued,
without further incident.  [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing changes
continued, and thoracic surgery followed the patient; they felt
the wound to be not infected.  On HD#[**3-17**], his erythema
surrounding the wound improved.  His wound culture returned
sparse MSSA, and he was switched from IV vanco to IV oxacillin.
Patient never developed a fever in the hospital.  Blood cultures
were negative at the time of discharge.  A PICC line was placed
in RUE.  He will continue to receive 9 more days of IV oxacillin
for a total of 2-week IV antibiotics course.
.
2. CAD: Patient's lateral ST depressions on EKG that occurred
during the episode after IV vanco infusion resolved with the
resolution of tachycardia.  He was ruled out for MI, with CKs of
37, 37, 33, and TnT of 0.07, 0.05 and 0.03.  Patient was
continued on Lipitor, Zetia, Toprol, losartan, and SL NG prn; he
was started on 81mg of aspirin.  He remained on telemetry for
his two day stay in the MICU; upon transfer to the medicine
floor, he remained off of telemetry.  On HD#3, he had an echo,
which showed LV EF 30% and LV infereolateral akinesis (see echo
[**2169-3-31**]).
.
3. Sternal Wound: No more pus was expressed from the wound while
in the hospital.  [**Hospital1 **] wet to dry dressing changes continued.
Thoracic surgery team examined the wound daily and felt the
wound to be not contaminated.  Erythema surrounding the wound
resolved.  He was maintained on IV vanco for 3 days, and then
switched to IV oxacillin after wound culture grew sparse MSSA.
He will continue on IV oxacillin for 9 more days for a total of
2-week IV antiobiotics course.
.
4. HTN: home medications were continued.
.
5. DM: His home meds of metformin was continued.  He was also
covered with regular insulin sliding scale.  He was on a heart
healthy diet.  His blood sugar was relatively well controlled
during this admission, with finger sticks ranging from 100 to
low 200s.
.
6. small cell cancer in R lung: This is a new diagnosis for the
patient from the FNA cytology done on [**2169-3-23**].  Patient and
family was made known of this diagnosis during this admission.
Further therapy will be coordinated asn an outpatient between
