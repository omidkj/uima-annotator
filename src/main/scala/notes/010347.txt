Pleuritic Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 50 yo female with COPD (FEV1 0.6), hx of PE
recently admitted (d/c [**2199-2-16**]) for ?CAP and still on
azithromycin presents after noting a blood sugar of 450 at home
and developing pain under her right breast. Patient reports that
the chest pain developed while in the hospital on [**2-15**] and has
been getting steadily worse since then; it became so severe this
a that she finally came to the ED. Pain is in the R lower chest
under her R breast, is worse w/ inspiration. Has had mild
nausea, no vomiting. She reports feeling chills at home, but no
fevers. Has had increased wheezing at home, also cough but not
increased from baseline, no increased mucous production. She has
been taking all of her meds as prescribed. No headache, syncope,
abd pain, diarrhea/constipation, melena, BRBPR, dysuria,
hematuria, lower ext edema, or calf pain/tenderness. No changes
in weight.

Vitals in the ED T 99.8 HR 90-100 SBP 120 R 20-40 O2 sats 95% on
4L. ABG 7.39/45/63; lactate 3.1. CXR was done and demonstrated
increased bilat infiltrates. Blood cx were obtained and patient
was started on levofloxacin, vancomycin, solumedrol and
combivent nebs. Given her hx of PE, her respiratory distress,
and pleuritic R sided chest pain, she was started empirically on
heparin gtt to cover a possible PE. CTA could not be performed
[**2-28**] renal failure. While in the ED patient grew very shaky,
blood glucose was 54 so she was given one amp D50. Repeat FS was
354 - covered with 6 units reg insulin.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 50 yo female w/ COPD, diet-controlled diabetes
mellitus, history of small pulmonary embolus in [**2198**] who was
recently discharged on [**2-16**] after being admitted for
hyperkalemia and treated with azithromycin for COPD
exacerbation. Patient now admitted with COPD exacerbation,
pleuritic chest pain and poorly controlled diabetes. Her
hospital course is summarized below by problem.

1)COPD. Initially presented with hypoxia, likely due to acute
COPD exacerbation with underlying poor reserve, FEV1 0.6L. On
home 4 liters O2 at baseline, reports that she has been
compliant w/ meds (antibiotics, inhalers, nebs) although
question her ability to use these meds correctly. She was
initially moving very little air, subsequently became more
wheezy. Started on high dose steroids, tapered to Prednisone 60
mg daily upon transfer to the floor. She was attempted on MDI's
although had difficluty with these. Had been on Q4 hours
albuterol nebs, Q2 prn. Started Atrovent nebs (on spiriva at
home). Patient also may have underlying PNA based on non
contrast chest CT although clinically no fever or sputum
production. Sputum that was obtained was negative x 2. She
developed a leukocytosis in the setting of corticosteroids, but
was afebrile and had no other source of infection.  Initially
concern for PE given past history and pleuritic chest pain. EKG
without evidence of ischemia. Decision was made against CTA
given primarily hypoxic failure with poor air movement and
wheezing. CTA was thought to be risky with her underlying
chronic renal failure (secondary to lithium toxicity in the
past). Patient was treated with empiric Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin. Vancomycin discontinued on [**2-22**] due to negative
sputum cultures and levofloxacin stopped prior to [**Month/Year (2) **]
after course was completed.  Of note, patient's nasal cannula
oxygen was weaned to 1 liter prior to [**Month/Year (2) **], as she
tolerated it with saturations greater than 93%.  Her O2
saturations should titrated to as low a level as possible to
keep her saturations greater than 93%.

2)DM2. Poorly controlled on admission with FS in 400'[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
consulted and recommended increasing HISS and Glargine. Patient
continued to have FS in 400's while on high dose steroids.
Glargine increased to 25 untis with agressive humalog insulin
sliding scale. Patinet was recently started on NPH at home but
prior to that was on glipizide.   Patient's insulin sliding
scale and glargine (Lantus) should be titrated down according to
her fingersticks, as she is weaned off of the prednisone.

3)Pleuritic CP. Patient has had atypical chest pain for several
week any possibly months. EKG was negative multiple times,
cardiac enzymes repeatedly negative. Initial concern for PE
given pleuritic chest pain and tachycardia. Tachycardia thought
to be [**2-28**] to frequent Albuterol treatments and since her beta
blocker at home was held (restarted at low dose on [**2-22**]).
Bilateraly LENI's were ngative. TnT negative, BNP 73 on this
admission. Patient treated with IV morphine prn, non responsive
to sl ntg, also rx with maalox and PPI for possibly GERD. Of
note, her LFTs were wnl as well.

4)Renal failure. Secondary to lithium toxicity in the past,
baseline 1.6-1.8, elevated to 2.0 on admission, now stable.
