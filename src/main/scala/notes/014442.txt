History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 85025**] is a 66 year old woman with h/o HCV cirrhosis on
transplant wating list who was admitted from rehab with rising
creatinine concerning for HRS.
.
She was recently discharged on [**7-17**] after an admission for Hct
drop and hyperK in the setting of aldactone. Admission was
complicated by refractory ascites and hepatic encephalopathy
requiring a paracentesis which drained 4.5 L. She has been
scheduled for serial weekly paracentesis most recently done on
[**7-22**], and scheduled again for [**7-29**].
.
She is now being admitted today from [**Hospital3 **] today after
being seen in clinic yesterday with labs at that time revealing
rise in her creat to 2.1 (1.5, 1.3, 1.4) and T. bili 7.1 (3.2)
bringing her MELD up to 29. She is not on diuretics. She was
scheduled for repeat paracentesis tomorrow as an outpatient and
was to have PICC line placed at that time due to poor IV access.

.
On the floor, she reports abdominal pain and distension, as well
as LE edema. She is having diarrhea at baseline from her
lactulose. She reports occasional BRB on the toilet paper with
BMs which has been attributed to hemorrhoids. VS T: 99.2 131/77

Brief Hospital Course:
66-year-old woman with hepatitis C decompensated cirrhosis with
ascites, recurrent hepatic encephalopathy on transplant list,
now presenting with elevated creatinine and concern for HRS,
found to have SBP.
.
# SBP/Decompensated cirrhosis: Pt with a MELD of 30. She is on
transplant waiting list currently. She has been receiving weekly
serial therapeutic paracenteses and is due for her next one on
[**7-29**], but we canceled this in the setting of her acute illness.
Diagnostic tap confirmed SBP (760 WBC and 64% poly's) and she
was started on ceftriaxone, increased outpatient midodrine
regimen and added octreotide as well as albumin. She was
continued on rifaximin and lactulose. On [**2140-8-11**] she was cleared
for liver transplant and underwent ABO incompatible liver
transplant.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr up to 2.3 at presentation
from baseline of 1.5 on [**7-19**] raising concern for HRS. She has
been off diuretics since her prior discharge. At the time of
transplant she underwent CVVH in the operating room and then was
continued on CVVH in the ICU post transplant. She has been
continued on intermittent hemodialysis using a tunneled HD
catheter q Monday, Wednesday Friday and will continue on this
regimen. Status of recovery of kidney function will be followed
.
# Anemia:  Thought to be [**2-24**] hemorroidal bleed and also from
gastropathy seen on prior EGD. Colorectal surgery was consulted
previously for hemorrhoids but the family and pt did not want to
pursue surgery. Patient's hct has been stable at 25 in the past
but did drop to 18 at presentation. She received 2U PRBCs. On
[**8-10**] the patientunderwent successful coil embolization of a
distal jejunal branch of the
SMA with post-embolization angiograms demonstrating no further
extravasation
of contrast material.
.
Patient completed the course of Ceftriaxone for SBP, and based
on most recent diagnostic tap it is determined that the patient
is safe for transplant.
On [**2140-8-11**], an ABO incompatible liver was available for patient
and Deceased donor (brain dead) ABO INCOMPATIBLE (A TO O) liver
transplant (piggyback), portal vein to portal vein anastomosis,
common bile duct to common bile duct anastomosis, no T tube,
common hepatic artery to splenic artery, splenectomy was
performed by Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. During the surgery the patient
was maintained on CVVH. The patient received [**2129**] cc of
crystalloid, 6 units fresh frozen plasma, 6 units of packed
red cells, 3 units of platelets, [**2129**] cc of Cell [**Doctor Last Name **] and urine
output was 10 cc.  Estimated blood loss was 5500 cc.
She was transferred to the SICU in stable condition.
The patient received induction immunosuppresion per the ABO
incomaptible pathway to include 1000 mg solumedrol, cellcept and
Thymoglobulin.
Post operatively the ABO incompatible pathway was continued with
steroid taper, Cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **], Thymoglobulin was given for
5 total doses, and prograf was started on the evening of POD 1.
She received CVVH while in the unit and was then transitioned to
intermittent HD.
Daily Anti A titers were followed. Patient had received
plasmapheresis prior to the liver transplant and then on POD 4
and 5, the IgG titers were noted to be 1:8 and she received two
additional plasmepheresis sessions on those days.
She extubated on POD 2
The patient was having some difficulty with extubation, and
following physical exam, a chest CT was performed confirming a
large right sided pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed. This
remained in placed until POD 6 with full resolution of the
pneumothorax. The chest tube was d/c'd prior to her transfer to
the regular surgery floor.
The hemodialysis was continued throughout the hospital stay, her
urine output has been incidental and creatine has continued to
rise between HD treatments. She also continued to have
intermittent extra treatments for ultrafiltration. LE edema was
gone, however she was still having an oxygen requirement. Of
note the patient often goes in and out of AFib while on
hemodialysis. The patient has not been anticoagulated.
