Pertinent Results:
[**2106-1-9**] Chest CT: 1. Atherosclerotic calcification of the
thoracic aorta, coronary arteries, mitral, and aortic valve as
detailed above. See aortic MIPs in series 103. 2. Severe
centrilobular emphysema. 3. Nodular thickening of the left major
fissure, unclear if this represents focal atelectasis, or
pleural abnormality. Followup CT is recommended in [**3-14**] months to
reevaluate this area. 4. Compression deformity of T12 vertebral
body superior endplate, age indeterminate without prior
comparison imaging. 5. Cardiomegaly, with biatrial enlargement.

[**2106-1-10**] Head CT: 1. Small vessel ischemic disease. 2. Left
maxillary sinus mucosal thickening and fluid consistent with
sinusitis.

[**2106-1-11**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%.

[**2106-1-20**] TEE intraop: post CPB EF 30% with at least 3+ MR, on
epinephrine and levophed drips (per verbal report from Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 88150**])

[**2106-2-15**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right basal opacities have almost completely
resolved. There is extensive emphysema, a tracheostomy tube and
sternal wires after CABG. No evidence of newly occurred focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. The lateral radiograph
demonstrates a basal opacity in the right dorsal parts of the
lung, most likely attributable to a small pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was cleared by urology for surgery in the setting of
recent TURP and hematuria.  He underwent and completed the usual
routine pre-op work-up.  He did receive Plavix and surgery was
held to allow for appropriate washout of Plavix.  He does have a
h/o atrial fibrillation and was maintained on heparin
preoperatively.  Mr. [**Known lastname 88149**] was brought to the operating room on
[**2106-1-20**] where he underwent Off-pump CABG x 3 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
See operative report for full details.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  The patient initially required inotropic
and vasopressor support with numerous vasoactive drips. TEE on
POD 1 revealed EF 20%, inferior and lateral wall hypokinesis as
well as anterior wall motion abnormality.

The patient developed fever on POD 1 and was pan-cultured.
Fluconazole was started for yeast in urine.  Tube feeds were
initiated.  Platelet count would drop to 53,000, HIT screen was
sent and patient was started on Angiomax, as suspicion for HITT
was high.  HIT screen would return negative, and heparin was
started.  The patient did develop acute kidney injury with rise
in serum Creatinine to 1.6 (from baseline 0.8) and oliguria.
This was monitored closely and would resolve with return to
baseline creatinine.  The patient was extubated on POD 7, and
quickly developed respiratory distress with rising PA pressures.
 He was reintubated without complication.  Kefzol was started
for sternal drainage, which resolved.   Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient remained in
respiratory failure and did undergo tracheostomy and PEG
placement on [**2106-2-1**]. Coumadin started on [**2-4**] for atrial
fibrillation and history of strokes. VRE grew from urine and he
was started on a course of linezolid on [**2-6**].
He was transferred to the step-down floor on [**2-8**] and tolerating
Passy-Muir valve trials. Over the next week he continued to
received medical management. He worked with physical therapy for
strength and mobility. He underwent routine swallow therapy. He
had no further setbacks and was discharged on [**2-18**] to rehab with
the appropriate medications and follow-up appointments. He will
continue Coumadin for atrial fibrillation and will need
follow-up set-up by rehab upon discharge from there.
