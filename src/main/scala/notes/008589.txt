Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
dCHF exacerbation/PNA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
72 yo female with history of CAD s/p CABG [**56**] years ago recent
cath with BMS to SVG to OM, CHF (EF 20-25% with LVH and mod MR)
who presents to the ED with chest pain after transfer from [**Hospital **].
.
She reports the chest pain has been present for the past [**4-7**]
days. She was in her usual state of health until several days
ago when she had a nose bleed, as well as what was described as
a possible panick attack, with increased shortness of breath and
chest discomfort. She was taken to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ([**Hospital3 **]) ED.
She was thought to be dry there, home lasix held since Friday
and she was given IV fluids (amout unknown). From there she was
sent back to rehab. At which point, on the day of admission she
again had an episode of shortness of breath and was brougth to
[**Hospital3 **], where she was told she had a heart attack (as per
family members).   At [**Hospital3 **], here troponins-I were elevated
at 1.9, up to 2.2.  Her labs there showed Crn 2.5 She was given
lasix 80mg IV.
  Of note, Since her discharge in [**Month (only) 359**], she has been at
rehab.  She subsequently developed chest pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.3 115 143/73 20 98% on 4LNC (on 2L
home O2). CXR was significant for bilateral infiltrates.  EKG
showed LBBB.  Labs were significant for elevated trop to 0.9,
WBC 14.8.   She received insulin for FSBG in 400s, lasix 80mg IV
? , nitro and heparin drip, and azithro/ceftriaxone for CAP
coverage.  VS on transfer RR 24, 97% On 4L, 118, 154/75.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains. She denies recent
fevers. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Imaging:
.
ECHO [**1-24**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 35 %). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2146-11-17**], the findings are similar.

.
Renal Ultrasound: [**1-30**]
IMPRESSION: Progressive bilateral renal atrophy, reflecting
chronic kidney disease.
.
CXR [**1-29**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing bilateral
pleural effusions have markedly decreased. On the right, the
effusion is
barely visible. On the left, large parts of the effusion have
resolved. As a consequence, the basal lung areas show
substantially improved ventilation.
Unchanged is the overall increased size of the cardiac
silhouette. The
diameter of the pulmonary vessels suggests ongoing slightly
increased
intravascular fluid. No focal parenchymal opacities suggesting
pneumonia

Speech and Swallow Eval:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Suggest a PO diet of nectar thick liquids and regular
consistency solids.
2. Meds crushed with puree per pt request
3. ENT consult to evaluate vocal cord mobility / adduction
4. TID oral care
5. We will f/u to try to advance her diet with strategies if her
respiratory status improves further.

ENT [**1-24**]:
A/P:  72 F with complicated cardiac and pulmonary history
notable
for CAD s/p CABG, asthma COPD on 2L at home, with dysphonia.
Exam
notable for mild-moderate supraglottic edema suggestive of
laryngopharyngeal reflux changes and presbylarynx (ie, age
related changes to glottis). No evidence of focal traumatic
injury to laryngeal apparatus.  Also n
