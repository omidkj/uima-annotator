Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute drop in hct

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
77 year-old man with a history of T3N1 poorly differentiated
esphageal cancer diagnosed earlier this year, diabetes type II
and asthma, hx of two spinal surgeries after trauma who was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute drop in Hct. He has been
hemodynamically stable and source of the Hct drop remains
unclear.
.
His downward spiral started [**8-21**]. Patient had a fall with head
trauma and c-spine requiring 2 large spinal surgeries. His
post-op course was complicated by desaturations requiring
intubation with extubation on [**9-3**], hct drop responsive to
transfusion, pneumonia with GNR-serratia and GPC not identified,
frank aspiration necessitating feeding tube placement by IR and
poor urine output.
.
He was discharged to rehab and then readmitted the same day
because the rehab thought he was an inappropriate admission. On
arrival to the ED that day, he was found to be desaturating on
6L NC so he was taken to the OR by anesthesia due to his recent
cervical surgeries. Pt was extubated 5 days later and tolerated
it well. He was discharged back to rehab on [**9-17**] with Hct of
25.7.
.
At rehab, on [**9-19**], nursing note states that his Hct was 23.2. He
recieved 1uPRBC and there was no documented Hct after that.
Patient was then noted to be frankly aspirating and thus, he was
scheduled to have a PEG placed. This was done using an EGD on
[**2120-9-20**]. At that time, no duodenal ulcers or bleeding was seen.
On [**2120-9-21**], a CBC was checked at rehab and they found his hct to
be 18 and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was asymptomatic and HD stable. He
received one unit of NS and 2U PRBCs. He was guaiac negative and
NG lavage was not done given the negative EGD the day prior. A
chest and abd CTA was done given concern for perforation
following PEG placement but was negative for any bleeding,
perforation or dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77M with hx of DM, asthma, cervical spine fractures s/p
fusion and repair, aspiration pneumonia s/p PEG placement,
esophageal cancer presents with acute on chronic anemia
.
1) drop in hct: On admission the pt's hct was noted to be 19.5.
Ct abdomen and chest were negative for acute bleeds and the pt
was guaiac negative. The pt's bleed was felt to likely be [**12-20**] to
the hematoma on his neck at his surgical site. A CT neck was
performed demonstrating that the hematoma on his neck had
enlarged. This was thus felt to be the most likely source of
bleeding for the pt given the other negative findings/imaging.
Ortho was called to evaluate the pt. However, by this time the
pt's hct had stabilized and ortho felt no intervention was
warranted.

On day one and two of admission the pt received three units of
prbcs with appropriate bumps in his hematocrit. His hematocrit
stabilized by day two of admission and continued to rise to its
present level of 28.3.

2) RUE DVT The pt's lovenox was held on admission. A repeat b/l
U/S demonstrated no presence of DVT on either side. The risks
and benefits of restarting lovenox were discussed amongst the
team members. Given his risk for re-bleed, it was decided to
hold his lovenox on discharge.
.
3) Metastatic esophageal cancer: The pt's esophageal cancer was
not an active issue during this admission. He is followed by an
oncologist in NH and is S/P XRT and chemotherapy with Cisplatin.

.
4) DM: The pt was maintained on an RISS throughout admission.
.
5) Asthma: The pt was maintained on albuterol/atrovent nebs prn
throughout his admission.
.
6) hx of tachycardia/MAT: Ther pt was continued on a CCB for HR
control. His HR was regular and well-controlled throughout the
admission.
.
7) Stage 3 sacral decub: The pt was continued on vitamin C,
zinc, and daily wound care and placed on an air mattress.
.
8) FEN: The pt is s/p PEG tube placement. He was placed on TFs
throughout the admission with lytes repletion prn.
.
9) Ppx: The pt was placed on pneumoboots, a PPI, bowel regimen,
and aspiration precautions throughout the admission.
.
10) Code: Per the pt his code status was to be DNI, though he
wanted to be resuscitated via CPR and electric shocks if
necessary. The pt understands that these two usually go hand in
hand
