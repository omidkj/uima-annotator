CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and hypotension.

The patient initially was admitted to the [**Hospital6 7482**] on [**4-13**] for a history of worsening dyspnea and
was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**4-14**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49 year old male with
a history of severe pulmonary hypertension on Flolan,
scleroderma with CREST variety, transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for hypotension, blood pressure 68/5 and
worsening hypoxia.  The patient states that for the last week
he has had increasing shortness of breath and cough with
yellow sputum and rare blood streaks.  The patient improved
with three days of azithromycin and reportedly was compliant
with medications and diet.  The patient went from walking
around the apartment to being only able to ambulate for a few
feet.

The patient was admitted [**4-13**] to the Medicine Floor.  In the
Emergency Room, the patient had a saturation of 100% on four
liters and received empiric Levaquin, Lasix 40 to 80, Bumex,
Spironolactone, Diltiazem.  The patient continued on Levaquin
in-house.  A pulmonary and hypertension doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**]
and recommended intravenous antibiotics, gentle diuresis and
decreasing the Flolan rate to 23.  The Congestive heart
failure Service was also [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] who agreed with the plan.

Earlier on the day prior to transfer, the patient had an
episode of increasing respiratory rate to the 40s and
tachypnea, shortness of breath, and decrease in his systolic
blood pressure to the 90s on 100% non-rebreather, which
improved his respiratory rate to 30.  Ativan and Lasix were
given.  The patient now had an increasing oxygen requirement
and desaturating to 71 to 80 on six liters and blood pressure
of 78/48 with respiratory rate in the 30s.  On nonrebreather,
the patient had a saturation to 90%.  The patient originally
slightly lightheaded but resolved after 250 cc normal bolus
with a gas of 7.47, 37, and 118 on 100% non-rebreather.

The patient currently reports intermittent shortness of
breath worse with exertion, nausea and left axillary pain.
The patient denies recent fevers, chills, night sweats, head
trauma, head congestion, sick contacts, sore throat, chest
pain, left arm pain, abdominal pain, bloody stool.  The
patient has baseline three pillow orthopnea and now feels
that he could not lay back more than head around 60 degrees
due to his dyspnea.  The patient also says baseline systolic
blood pressure is 110.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Scleroderma of the CREST variety.
2.  Severe pulmonary hypertension on Flolan and home O2 of
approximately four liters.  As noted, Flolan was increased
from 23 to 25 as an outpatient two days prior to admission
and he has been on it for one year.
3.  Bilateral pleural effusions status post thoracentesis in
[**2139-12-21**] that was non-malignant.
4.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  History of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
8.  History of low potassium and low calcium.
9.  History of chest wall cellulitis.

and rash and Viagra causing headaches.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone in an apartment where his sister
lives above.  The patient denies tobacco history or alcohol
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.1 F.; blood pressure
72/53 with a MAP of 57; heart rate of 105; oxygen saturation
98% on seven liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient
appropriately answered questions but is in very mild
respiratory distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equally round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Neck with jugular venous pressure
approximately 11 cm; no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:
regular rate and rhythm, tachycardia, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Possible S4.  Lungs:  Right greater than left
crackles approximately half way on the right base.  Left
axilla tender to palpation with reproducible pain.  Abdomen:
Hickman line on the right chest dry with dressings; clean,
dry and intact.  Positive abdominal bowel sounds.  Mild
tenderness in the epigastrium; otherwise soft without masses.
Extremities are warm; no lower extremity edema.  Tight skin
of skin and fingers, and question toes.  Pink nodules on the
shin.

LABORATORY:  Data is CK of 37, troponin less than 0.1, white
blood cell count of 9.0, hematocrit 30.0, platelets 194, zero
bands.  INR is 1.2, potassium 3.5, creatinine 1.7.  Lactate
1.2 with a gas of 7.47, 37, 118, on 100% non-rebreather.

EKG is sinus tachycardia to 102, low voltage, poor R wave
progression.

Chest x-ray with small right effusion, right interstitial
opacity greater than left.

Right heart catheterization on [**2140-2-4**], revealed an
RA-pressure of 86, RV of 67/8, PA of 67/22; a wedge pressure
of 11, cardiac output of 5.7 and 3.1 for the index and a PVR
421.

An echocardiogram is ejection fraction of greater than 60%,
left atrium mildly dilated, left ventricular cavity wall,
right ventricle moderately dilated, moderate global RV free
wall hypokinesis.  Abnormal septal motion consistent with RV
volume overload.  Trace aortic regurgitation, trace mitral
regurgitation, one plus tricuspid regurgitation, moderate
pericardial effusion, no signs of tamponade.  Brief right
atrium collapse.

Pulmonary function tests on [**2139-2-19**], FVC of 51% of
predicted, 2.32; FEV1 2.06, 61% of predicted; FEV1 to FVC
ratio is 89 or 119% of predicted.

Cytology from a tap in [**2139-11-21**], cytology is negative
for malignant cells.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  HYPOTENSION:  The patient was likely hypotensive after
significant diuresis prior to the day of admission and
worsening volume status.  Initially concern for septic shock,
however, the patient was afebrile and did not have any blood
cultures.

The patient's systolic blood pressure and symptoms of
dizziness responded to a small bolus, making hypovolemia the
more likely etiology.  Other etiologies included cardiac and
distributive shock, however, the patient subsequently
underwent placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter placement for
evaluation of his cardiac function, which was placed on [**2140-4-20**], which subsequently revealed elevated PA pressures
with a systolic in the 90s and a wedge pressure of 14.  It
was unlikely thought that this patient was in congestive
heart failure but was likely thought to have progressing of
his pulmonary hypertension.

2.  HYPOXIA:  The patient also presented with worsening
hypoxia.  Differential included worsening progressive disease
of severe pulmonary hypertension as well as pneumonia from a
chest x-ray which showed right opacity for which the patient
was treated with a course of Levaquin.  Other etiologies
included a pulmonary embolism; LENIs were performed which
were negative and concern for an in situ pulmonary embolism
was high given the patient's current medical condition.  The
patient was subsequently treated with a heparin drip;
however, this was complicated by a decrease in his platelets
and thrombocytopenia.  Heparin was stopped in favor of
Argrotaban and a HIT antibody was sent which is pending at
this time.

The patient's course was subsequently complicated by episode
of worsening hemoptysis, at which point anti-coagulation was
discontinued given the patient's risk for bleeding and an INR
of 1.8.

Other etiologies for h
