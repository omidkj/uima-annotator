Brief Hospital Course:
55yo female w HCV cirrhosis, previously compensated with recent
decompensation after [**12/2171**] cholecystectomy, being worked up for
transplant, admitted with presumed SBP for antibiotic therapy.

#SBP: The patient was admitted with fevers, increased abdominal
distension.  In the ED, she had a diagnostic paracentesis that
showed 20,000 RBC, 1050 WBC with 5% PMN's. Given the patient's
clinical picture, she was started on empiric CTX for presumed
SBP.  On the floors the patient was persistently hypotensive
(SBP in the 80s), requiring transfer to the MICU.  RUQ U/S and
CT abdomen did not reveal any obvious signs of intra-abdominal
bleeding. Given concern for possible GI source of infection, the
patient was started on broad-spectrum coverage with
Vancomycin/CTX/flagyl.
Given her improved clinical status, and negative ascites
cultures, her vancomycin and cipro were discontinued on [**6-8**] and
[**6-9**].  She remained on Zosyn to cover possible SBP as well as
HCAP (see below).

#DIC: During her MICU stay, the patient was noted to have low
fibrinogen, high INR, low haptoglobin, and positive FDPs. This
was thought to be related to her liver failure vs. early DIC in
the setting of infection. Her DIC labs, as well as her hct and
plt count were trended and remained stable for the remainder of
her hospitalization.
.
#PNA: Initially, during her ICU course, the patient developed
worsening respiratory status.  Given radiologic findings, this
was thought to be related to fluid overload vs. compressive
atelectasis [**12-24**] ascites vs pneumonia. She underwent a second
paracentesis, during which 800 cc of fluid was removed.  Her
respiratory status did not improve.  On Day 3 of admission, the
patient's antibiotic regimen was broadened to
Vancomycin/zosyn/ciprofloxacin to provide better HCAP. Her
respiratory symptoms began to improved.  Her vancomycin and
cipro were stopped as discussed above, and the patient was
continued on pip-tazo to cover possible SBP as well as HCAP.
The patient completed an 8d course of antibiotics and was weaned
off supplemental O2.  She remained with mild residual cough
improved with PRN benzonatate.
.
#HCV Cirrhosis: The patient was being worked up for a transplant
prior to her admission.  During this hospitalization,
pretransplant serologies were sent off.  An EGD was performed on
this hospitalization, demonstrating no varices.  The patient
will follow up as an outpatient for mammogram, pap smear, and
PFTs.  During this hospitalization, she had a mild rise in LFTs,
thought to be [**12-24**] to zosyn, which resolved after discontinuation
of the zosyn.
.
#Hematemesis: After placement of dobhoff tube, pt had single
episode of emesis with several small blood clots.  Dobhoff was
pulled and NGtube was placed for gastric lavage, which did not
demonstrate further signs of active bleeding.  The patient's
hematocrit remained stable during this time.  At this time,
there was low suspicion for a GI bleed, however given the
patient's cirrhosis, it was decided to send her for an EGD.  The
EGD did not reveal any varices or signs of bleeding.  A dobhoff
tube was placed post-pylorically to reinitiate tube feeding.

#Nutrition: Patient reported poor appetite and weight loss over
the
