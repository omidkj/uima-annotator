HPI:

66M Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 y/o male with a history of CAD (VF arrest
post CABG with ICD/PPM inserted), systolic CHF (EF 20%), PVD s/p
bilat fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypasses, AF s/p DC cardioversion [**2120**], DM2 on
insulin recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 17387**] with a CHF
exacerbation during which he was treated with agressive diuresis
with a resultant 23 lb weight loss. He was discharged to radius
speciality hospital. There they had difficulty diuresing during
his LTAC stay which was complicated by inadequate response to
lasix and metalazone in addition to acute renal failure. His
weight at radius remained in the high 190s whereas his baselilne
dry weight is closer to 180.
He is currently on demadex 80 mg [**Hospital1 **].
He is s/p 1 U PRBCS on [**2122-2-18**]. He was guiac positive and thus
ASA and pradaxa were held pending a GI evaluation.

He now presents  w/fever, severe L hand pain/erythema after IV
Lasix infiltrated last night at rehab per paperwork. Also has
pain/warmth in *R* wrist, and in both shoulders.
.
He received abx in the ED. Upon talking with the plastics team
they do not think that this is cellulitis. The [**Doctor Last Name **] pressures
obtained are reassuring that there is not an effusion that can
be tapped and they are also reassuring that compartment syndrome
is not present. They do not recommend continuing abx and think
that this is c/w a polyarticular gout exacerbation.
