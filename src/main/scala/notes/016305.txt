Aspirin / Percocet / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachypnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
84 yo F with severe COPD, asthma, HTN, steroid induced
hyperglycemia, and VRE recently discharged on [**2169-8-1**] for a left
lower lobe pneumonia who presented to her pulmonary f/u
appointment with increased SOB, and 13 pound weight gain (Lasix
dose decreased in hospital given rising creatinine).
.
Patient reports that since discharge, her breathing has worsened
and her legs have swelled up significantly. Additionally, she
reports that her breathing has gotten much worse at home
(patient on home O2, discharged with O2 for sat of 88% on room
air on day of discharge). Finally, patient reports that she has
no history of diabetes but began to have sugars to the 500s on
steroids during her last hospitalization and she was sent home
with SQ insulin during her prednisone taper.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was tachypneic with sats at baseline 88-92% on RA.
Physical exam showed significant LE edema, elevated JVP, and
rhonchorus breath sounds. CXR showed RLL atelectasis. Cr
elevated to 1.8. Pt given lasix 40mg IV, neb treatments, and
insulin.


Past Medical History:
# Asthma. History of greater than 5 hospitalization with no
history of intubations. She has been on steroids since the
beginning of [**Month (only) 216**]. Prior to this, she had been steroid free
for
the past 2 years.
# Hypertension.
# Steroid induced hyperglycemia. Discharged on insulin following
her [**Hospital1 **] admission.
# Peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-peroneal
bypass in [**2162**]


Social History:
The patient denies any tobacco use. Occasional alcohol use. The
patient has a 24 hour home health aide at home.


Family History:
Asthma in her father

Physical Exam:
BP 125/61, HR 106-115, RR 30-34, O2 Sat 97% on 3L
Gen: older female in NAD
HEENT: clear oral pharynx, dry MM
CV: RRR 2/6 SM at RUSB
Lungs: scattered wheezes and rhonchi especially around right
lung fields
Abd: soft, NT, +BD, +distended
Extrem: +[**11-28**] pitting edema bilat to thigh with skin color
changes
Skin: right flank area with non blanching erythmatous rash with
few blisters in a dermatomal distribution, does not cross
midline.


Pertinent Results:
CXR: 9//14/06
IMPRESSION: Interval volume loss in the right middle lobe that
could
represent infiltrate, atelectasis, or neoplasia compressing the
right middle bronchus. Persistent left lower lobe opacity
obscuring the hemidiaphragm and cardiac silhouette.
.
[**2169-8-14**]:
BARIUM ESOPHAGRAM: Barium passes freely through the esophagus.
There was an episodes of aspiration into the [**Last Name (un) **] heaa which did
not elicit spontaneous cough . No structural abnormalities were
detected in the region of the pharynx and cervical esophagus.
There are tertiary peristaltic contractions and mild dilatation
of the esophagus. There is a small axial hiatal hernia and a
small degree of GE reflux was observed.
IMPRESSION:
1. Axial hiatal hernia and GE reflux.
2. Nonspecific motor disorder of esophagus
3. Episode of aspiration with no spontaneous cough
.
ECHO [**2169-8-11**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course: 84 y/o F with h/o COPD, asthma, HTN,
recent LLL pneumonia, who presents with increased dyspnea.  Pt
was admitted to the medical ICU with dyspnea SOB.  She was
initially found to have a RML lung collapse: No fever,
leukocytosis to support infectious etiology, and recently
completed 2 week course of levofloxacin. Therefore held off on
further antibiotics innitially. Suspected collapse secondary to
aspiration. Barium swallow confirmed silent aspiration into the
airways. Aggressive chest physical therapy, nebulizers, and
aspiration precautions undertaken to help prevent further
aspiration and recruit atelectatic lung. [**Month (only) 116**] need PEG for
nutritional support given her ongoing aspiration, but patient
declined. Video swallow study and nutrition consult for further
evaluation displayed gross aspiration.  An attempt was made to
transfer the patient to the floor, upon arrival she became
tachypneic and tachycardic with labored breathing and was
returned to the MICU.  Pt was started on Vancomycin/Zosyn to
complete a 14 day course for aspiration pneumonia.  She
responded well clinically.  Pt was discharged NPO and was
receiving nutirition via an NG tube.
.
# Tachycardia: h/o MAT. HR in 100's-120's on admission.
Continued on diltiazem. Treating underlying lung disease.
.
# COPD: On home O2. Continued on prednisone taper. Continued
albuterol/atrovent nebs prn.
.
# Hyperglycemia: Steroid induced hyperglycemia. Covered with
glargine + SSI.
.
# Acute renal failure: Cr 1.8 on admission, up from baseline
1.0-1.1. At time of last discharge, creatinine was 1.5. Likely
volume overloaded but intravascularly depleted, with pre-renal
physiology. Attempted diuresis with lasix as creatinine
tolerates. Held ace-I pending stable renal function.  Pt never
fully returned to baseline renal fnx.
.
#UTI:  A VRE UTI was treated with oral Cipro in house and the
infection resolved.
.
# Back rash: R back/hip rash in dermatomal distribution along
with pain locally at site. Likely zoster. No active vesicles,
but treated empirically on acyclovir. Pain persisted and patient
was tried on Capsaicin cream.  She was d/c on Lidocaine gel for
the rash and ultram for pain.

# PVD: continued on plavix
# Asthma: cont singulair, advair, [**Doctor First Name 130**]
