Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Pulmonary Edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIGHT tunneled IJ HD catheter

History of Present Illness:
61 yo F with CAD, CHF EF 30%, ESRD s/p transplant, now failed
who presents with pulmonary edema, AoCRF and need for dialysis.
Patient was seen by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-29**] who thought she was
euvolemic at the time.  After that went to [**Hospital3 **] for vacation
with her family and for the past several days she has been
feeling progressively more SOB. Today was the worst day so she
decided to go to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  At CCH she was found to be
in respiratory distress and was intubated.  She was given
furosemide 60 mg IV and kayexalate 30 mg but her urine output
was only 30 mL.  Her labs were remarkable for WB 8.3, trop
0.274, BNP 4428, K 5.5 and BUN/Cr 88/5.4.  She was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for futher care.
.
In the ED, initial labs remarkable for WBC 11.3, Hct 27.8, BNP
[**Numeric Identifier 104608**], BUN 88/5.7. Patient was initially on dopamine for low BP
but after propofol was switched to fentanyl/midazolam her BP
came up and dopamine was weaned off. CXR was consistent with
pulmonary edema. Renal was contact[**Name (NI) **] for need of emergent
dialysis. VS prior to transfer BP 97/59 HR 57 Sat 100% on CMV
100% FiO2, Tv 480 mL and PEEP 10.
.
On the floor, she is intubated and sedated.

[**2204-6-4**] ECHO:  The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis and
regional akinesis/dyskinesis of the distal LV/apex.The inferior
wall is akinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with borderline free wall contractility
(RV apex not well seen). The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

CXR [**2204-6-4**]:  Cardiomegaly, [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion, and bilateral
parenchymal
opacities most compatible with pulmonary edema. Radiographic
followup after diuresis is recommended.

Renal Transplant US [**2204-6-4**]:  Progression of high resistance
pattern of flow within the transplanted kidney with lack of
antegrade diastolic flow in the intrarenal and main renal
arteries. Patent renal vein.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2204-6-4**]
No evidence of DVT.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2204-6-5**]:
Pulmonary edema present on [**6-4**] has substantially improved.
Residual
opacification at the lung bases is probably a combination of
residual edema, pleural effusions and atelectasis.
Heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. Tip
of the endotracheal tube, with the chin in neutral or elevation
is less than 2 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn 2-3 cm
to avoid unilateral intubation. Clinical service notified.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2204-6-7**]
Comparison is made with prior study [**6-5**].
Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural
effusions are larger on the left side associated with
atelectasis in the bases of the lungs, left greater than right.
Multiple calcified lung nodules in the right upper lobe are
again noted. Pulmonary edema continues to improve, now mild.
There are no new lung abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
61 yo F with CAD, CHF EF 30%, ESRD s/p transplant now failing,
not yet on HD who presented to OSH with dyspnea and was
intubated due to pulmonary edema causing respiratory distress.
Now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent HD.

#. Respiratory distress: Patient presented to OSH with dyspnea
and was intubated due to respiratory distress. A CXR showed
pulmonary edema and her BNP was measured at [**Numeric Identifier 104608**]. Felt to be
secondary to worsening renal function causing oliguria, fluid
overload and pulmonary edema due to fluid poor cardiac reserve.
Patient was started on lasix drip with good urine output and was
extubated on [**6-6**]. She has been slowly weaned off of O2
requirements and is now saturating 98% on room air.

#. AoCRF: Patient's last Cr was 4.4 at PCP's office on [**5-29**] and
5.7 on [**6-6**] during this admission. Unclear as to cause of acute
change but failing transplant is most likely.  Renal ultrasound
showed progression of high resistance pattern of flow within the
transplanted kidney with lack of antegrade diastolic flow in the
intrarenal and main renal arteries. Patent renal vein. A right
IJ tunneled line was placed and hemodialysis was started during
this admission. She received 3 HD treatments prior to discharge.
She will be continuing HD on a regular out patient basis. Per
nephrology recommendations we will be continuing Tacrolimus,
Mycophenolate Mofetil and Prednisone for her renal transplant.
She was setup for M,W,F HD as outpt.

#. Congestive Heart Failure: A cardiolgy evaluation was
performed while she was in the MICU given her history of
worsening SOB and fluid overload on admission. An echocardiogram
was performed on this admission which showed overa
