AP ERECT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST (on admission): A PICC
is seen with the tip in the superior vena cava. Interval
development of interstitial pulmonary edema. There is discoid
atelectasis at the right lung base. No pleural effusions are
apparent. The heart size is within normal limits. IMPRESSION:
Interval development of pulmonary edema.  Discoid atelectasis at
the right lung base.
.
CHEST CT to R/O PE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral patchy opacities represent asymmetric pulmonary
edema versus
multifocal pneumonia.  Clinical correlation recommended.  No
evidence for PE.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis and very small bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
EKG on admission:
Sinus rhythm, Probable old anteroseptal infarct. Since previous
tracing, no significant change

Brief Hospital Course:
59F with osteomyelitis, s/p ant-inf MI s/p stent to pLAD, CHF
with EF 20-25%, was admitted intially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with CHF
exacerbation and then called out from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**6-25**] to [**Hospital1 **] service
for further work-up and treatment.
.
# CHF exacerbation: Patient was hypoxic on admission with
pulmonary edema on CXR, so was intubated and diuresed in ICU;
given her known EF = 20-25%, CHF was the most likely cause of
her dyspnea. No apparent cause for the acute exacerbation could
be identified; patient denies any dietary indiscretion, cardiac
enzymes were negative and EKG was unchanged from prior. PE was
also considered as a cause of her dyspnea, and given an elevated
D dimer, CTA of the chest was performed which did not identify
any PE. After 24 hours of ventilatory support and aggressive
diuresis, she was able to be extubated and transferred to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 telemetry [**Hospital1 **].
.
At the time of transfer to the [**Hospital1 **], patient appeared clinically
normovolemic. She was gently diuresed to slightly below her home
dry weight of 95lbs. She was started on metoprolol and
lisinopril was added once her creatinine had stabilized.
.
# Hct drop: From 28-21 with no evidence of active bleeding -
guiac negative. Patient received 2 units of PRBC in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior
to transfer with appropriate response, Hct stable thereafter.
Heme consult reviewed peripheral smear with no concerning
findings. Does not appear to be a consumptive process--no signs
of hemolysis on lab work. Iron studies c/w anemia of
inflammation. Acute change in Hct during acute pulmonary edema
appears to have resulted from fluid volume shifts.
.
# WBC drop: 9.1 to 2.3 on [**6-26**], gradually increased to 4.8 on
[**6-29**] without intervention. Unclear etiology; lymphocyte
predominant with a monocytosis suggestive of toxin-mediated bone
marrow suppression. Heme consult suspects drug reaction,
possibly levafloxacin, which was given in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and has been
reported to cause agranulocytosis. HIV infection can also cause
leukopenia, although patient denies high-risk behaviors such as
unprotected sex with anyone other than husband or IVDA, she
consented to be tested for HIV and test results pending.
.
# Short runs of WCT, asymptomatic: EP consulted and felt that
emergent ICD placement was not indicated given current
comorbidities. Had a negative V-Stim at [**Hospital1 112**] [**2145-12-17**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (EF 20-25% at that time). Pt. wants to avoid ICD if
possible. Continued beta blocker therapy should decrease the
incidence of the NSVT/WCT.
.
# Anxiety/depression: Patient says she has had a psychiatrist
for many years and used to take valium with good effect. Her new
doctor, Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 47716**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 108658**], stopped benzos b/c she had
a history of abusing the valium and started prozac plus
neurontin. [**6-27**] patient expressed SI and was seen by in-house
psychiatry consult, who felt patient was not at risk to self and
did not need 1:1 sitter but recommended treating her significant
anxiety with resperidone and uptitrating neurontin. However,
patient had symptomatic hypotension after first dose risperidone
1mg, but patient said she slept well and felt much better the
morning after the risperidone, so restarted risperidone at
0.25mg hs prn. Continued home dose of fluoxe
