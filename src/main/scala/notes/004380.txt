Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
68 yo male, h/o CAD s/p CABG, multiple PTCA's showing diffuse
3vd, with known systolic and diastolic dysfunction (EF
7/02=15%), presenting now with shortness of breath and pulmonary
edema.  As per his wife, he had some ?dietary indiscretions
(salty foods) the night prior to admission.  He woke up this
morning with acute shortness of breath requiring tripod
positioning.  EMS wa called, and he was intubate en route to the
ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  On arrival, he was
hypertensive, requiring a nitro gtt that bottomed out his
pressures.  He was then started on a dopamine gtt, and right SC
central line placement was complicated by arterial stick.  He
became tachycardic to the 130's on dopamine, and he was changed
to levophed for pressure support.  Bedside TTE showed 2+ MR,
EF=20% (on dopa).  Multiple attempts to place an arterial line
resulted in hematoma (line was finally placed), and blood was
aspirated via his NGT.  He was transferred to the CCU for
further managment where he was maintained on levophed, started
on a lasix drip.  His pacemaker was also interrogated by EP
(?fired for SVT 130's, causing V-tach, then fired resulting in
reversion to NSR in 50's).

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  CAD: He has a history of severe 3vd, s/p CABG with recent
catheterization showing patent grafts with totally occluded
native vessels.  He is not a candidate for any further
intervention at this time.  It is possible that his salty
dietary indiscretions caused an increase in SBP leading to a
?new ischemic event leading to flash pulmonary edema.  His
enzymes were elevated on admission and remained stable.  The
decision was made not to anticoagulate given his bleeding.  He
was continued on his outpatient regimen of Coreg, Lisinopril,
and Imdur (Imdur at decreased dose of 60 mg daily secondary to
low systolic blood pressures).  He never had any symptoms of
chest pain or anginal equivalents. He will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 60741**] at [**Hospital3 2005**], where he is enrolled in a VEGF trial.


2.  CHF: He has a known ischemic cardiomyopathy with systolic
and diastolic dysfunction.  Bedside TTE on admission showed
EF=20% with 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] likely had flash pulmonary edema in the
setting of hypertension.  He was initially started on a lasix
drip.  He declined Swan evaluation to determine CO/CI and
pulmonary pressures (recent SWAN at [**Hospital3 **] showing PCWP
=30, PA 50/36 with mean of 42, RV 50/25 with RA 25).  He was
intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure given his
pulmonary edema.  He was able to be extubated 1 day after
admission.  Diuresis was continued with IV lasix with good
effect.  He also received 1 day of lasix with zaroxalyn to
maximize diuresis.  He was symptomatically improved at time of
discharge, and chest X-ray showed improvement in his failure.
He was discharged on his outpatient dose of 80 mg PO lasix.  He
was instructed to weigh himself daily and to adhere to a low
salt diet on discharge.

3.  Rhythm: He was tachycardic on admission after dopamine
(SVT), and he then had episodes of ?ventricular tachycardia.
His AICD (biventricular, atrial sensing with ventricular pacing)
was interrogated by electrophysiology who believed that the
device interpreted the SVT as possible v-tach, fired which
caused actual ventricular tachycardia.  His pacer was
reprogrammed to fire in response to a higher rate (136).  When
he reverted to sinus rhythm in the 50's, his blood pressure
improved.  He remained in paced rhythm, 50-60's throughout the
rest of his hospital course.  He was continued on his amiodarone
and had no further events on telemetry.  He will follow up in
device clinic at [**Hospital3 2005**].

4.  Hypotension: He was likely in cardiogenic shock on admission
and was started on dopamine, changed to levophed (tachycardia in
response to dopamine).  Pt declined Swan, and his blood pressure
improved when his tachycardia resolved.  Levophed was
discontinued on hospital day 2 (overall hemodynamic status
improved with reversion to sinus/paced rhythm).

5.  Respiratory: He was intubated in the field for hypercarbic
respiratory failure, likely secondary to decreased gas exchange
from pulmonary edema.  He was extubated on Hospital day 2 and
remained stable on nasal cannula O2.  He was discharged,
saturating stably on room air.

6.  ARF/CRF: Creatinine was between 1.4-1.8 during
hospitalization.  This was likely his baseline.  He was
instructed to have his creatinine and potassium checked within
3-4 days of discharge.

7.  Leukocytosis: likely was a reaction to ischemia, but
cultures were checked to rule out infectious etiologies.  All
cultures were negative (urine, blood, sputum), and chest X-ray
was without signs of infiltrate or focal process.  He spiked a
fever >101.5 during admission, but no source was ever identified
and antibiotics were not started.  He was afebrile with a normal
white count at time of discharge.

8.  Anemia: He had a small hematocrit drop in the setting of
some IVF, hematoma [**2-4**] a line, and guaiac positive stools (blood
initially aspirated from NGT).  Serial CXR's were checked to
rule out hemothorax given arterial stick when subclavian line
was attempted.  He had some blood on top of stools attributed to
his hemorrhoids.  He had EGD/colonoscopy in [**Month (only) 956**] that were
basically within normal limits (reports were obtained;
colonoscopy showing polyps and diverticulosis).  He required 1 U
PRBC while in-house for a hct of 26.9.  Hemolysis labs were
checked and were negative. Upon discharge, he was instructed to
follow up with his PCP/gastroenterologist to ensure that
hematocrit remained stable.

9.  Disposition: He was discharged in good condition and will
follow up with his cardiologists at [**Hospital3 2005**].
