Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart catheterization, coronary angiogram, left
ventriculogram [**2165-2-11**]

SVG-OM,SVG-PDA) [**2165-2-12**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, hypertension and Hepatitis C who presented to the
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital with 4-5 days of increasing cough and
shortness of breath. He has not seen a doctor for a year [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Hospital1 882**] report.

He reported that dysnea is typical for him but that it had been
worse in the last 4-5 days  and that his sputum is typical but
had been darker and yellow-green in the last 4-5 days. He
reported that his baseline is to be able to walk 1 block before
getting short of breath..
A CXR showed no clear signs of pneumonia. EKG showed sinus
rhythm at 95,,no ST-T changes.

In the [**Hospital1 882**] ED he was given 2L NS, 500 mg IV levofloxacin;
albuterol; duonebs and 125 mg solumedrol.

He was admitted to the medicine floor for further management. On
the [**Hospital1 882**] medicine floor he had [**8-30**] SSCP on 2 AM of [**2-8**]
which was relieved with nitro x3 and Maalox. He again had [**8-30**]
SSCP which nitrox3 and Maalox only brought down to 3/10. On both
of these occasions, EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V4-6. He
got Heparin 4000 units followed by drip of 1100 units/hr; Plavix
300 mg; and Metoprolol 12.5 mg. A statin allergy was listed in
his chart so a statin was not given. (Pt denied allergies but
was judged to be possibly an unreliable historian.)

He had already received his home Aggrenox at 10 am; Enalapril 10
mg at 10:30 am; and Verapamil 40 mg at 2 pm. Transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cath was arranged. Cardiac surgery evaluated for coronary
artery revascularization.

mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild to
moderate anterior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild (1+)
