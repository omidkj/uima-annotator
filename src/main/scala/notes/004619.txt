Service: NMED

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hand weakness, slurred speech.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiography with unsuccessful recanalization of left ICA; pt
received 10 mg t-PA and 0.75 of Abciximab.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 76 year old right-handed male with past medical
history of coronary artery disease status post CABG and
stenting,
chronic renal insufficiency, vertebrobasilar aneurysm,
peripheral
vascular disease, mitral regurgitation status post mitral valve
replacement, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and congestive
heart failure who presented to the [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital 1225**]
Medical
Center on [**2180-10-14**] with right hand weakness and slurred speech.

Patient was in his usual state of health until 14:00 on the day
of admission. At that time, he was writing a letter and noted
that his right hand was weak; he was unable to fully grasp his
pen. He tried to talk to his daughter. His speech was garbled
and
he had difficulty getting words out. He was able to comprehend
speech. Family noted his face was drooping on the right side. He
felt like his gait was weak and unsteady. These symptoms lasted
10 minutes and then resolved. He took an aspirin at home, then
his family took him to the Emergency Department for evaluation.

He arrived in the Emergency Department by 15:00. Initial vitals
of temp 98, HR 72, BP 161/75. His symptoms then recurred, in
that
his right hand dropped his cane. On initial exam in the ED, he
had an NIH stroke scale of 4. He was unable to correctly name
the
year, had right lower facial droop, and decreased sensation to
pin and touch on his right arm and leg.  Finger stick blood
glucose testing was 90. CT head with no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, left vertebrobasilar aneurysm. Initial MRI showed an
area of restricted diffusion in the left subcortical parietal
region in area supplied by superior division of MCA,  absent
left
ICA and poor filling of left MCA with collaterals from right
ACOM. Examination after MRI showed NIH stroke scale of 2 with
right lower facial droop. Due to the improvement in his
symptoms,
small size of stroke, and presence of vertebrobasilar aneurysm,
thrombolysis with tPA was not pursued. He was admitted to the
neurology service.

On initial review of systems, he denied fevers, chills, sweats,
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, headaches, visual
changes, numbness, weakness, paresthesias, abdominal pain,
dysuria. No recent of history of surgery or trauma.

time, but no residual deficits.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was stable overnight from [**2180-10-14**] to am of [**2180-10-16**]. At
approximately 6am on [**2180-10-16**], noted by nurse to be in
respiratory distress, aphasic, and not moving right side at all.
NIH stroke scale 19. Felt to be in congestive heart failure by
exam and chest x- ray. Treated with IV lasix. Stat head CT
showed no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. Taken for
MRI/MRA. MRI demonstrated restricted diffusion in entire left
MCA territory; lesion not yet visible on FLAIR. Patient was
taken to angiography suite emergently for attempt at
intraarterial tPA thrombolysis. However, left ICA was totally
occluded and unable to access left sided circulation via ACOM.
Neurointerventionalist was able to traverse the left ICA
occlusion and five 10.5 mg of intraarterial tPA and 1mg of
Reopro. Multiple attempts to open left ICA via balloon
angioplasty were undertaken. However, flow was poor and vessel
reoccluded. Post-procedure, patient taken to ICU intubated.

Hospital course has been remarkable for difficulty weaning from
ventilator due to volume overload, difficulty handling
secretions and aspiration pneumonia. He received a course of
levofloxacin and metronidazole for aspiration. He has been
treated with IV Lasix for CHF. He was successfully extubated on
[**2180-10-23**]. He was
transiently on vancomycin for sputum culture with S. aureus.
After extubation, he was tachypneic and had several episodes of
respiratory distress whic
