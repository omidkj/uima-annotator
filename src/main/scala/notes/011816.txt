HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old
white female first seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**] on [**2131-4-19**], for
evaluation of a 5.1 centimeter mass in the upper pole of her
left kidney first noted on CT of the abdomen on [**2131-4-12**].
The CT was performed in response to symptoms of diarrhea.  A
question of Crohn's disease was high on the list because of
her known history of Sjogren's syndrome.  No evidence of
metastases were noted on chest, abdomen and pelvic CT and
confirmed by MR.  The patient is now being admitted for left
laparoscopic nephrectomy.  There is no history of urinary
tract infection, gross hematuria, smoking history or family
history of genitourinary cancer.  Hemoglobin 14.4, alkaline
phosphatase 113.  Torso CT and MR showed a 5.1 centimeter
mass upper pole of the left kidney, single LRA with negative
lymph nodes and adrenals.  Right kidney appears OK.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura treated with steroids
last in [**2129**].
2.  Deep vein thrombosis.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Irritable bowel syndrome.
5.  Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy for endometriosis.
6.  Fibromyalgia.
7.  Positive rheumatoid factor, Sjogren's syndrome.
8.  Anserine bursitis.

1.  Elavil.
2.  Lipitor.
3.  Clonazepam.
4.  Neurontin.
5.  Tramadol.
6.  Imodium.
7.  Currently Ciprofloxacin ear drops for an otitis externa.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient is a well
appearing female in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination - No masses and no bruits. The
chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
is regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen is soft, flat,
nontender.  Extremities - no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
Neurologic examination is intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2131-5-7**], and
taken directly to the operating room where a hand assisted
laparoscopic left nephrectomy was performed.  The patient
initially tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the
recovery room.  After a few hours in the recovery room, the
patient was sent to the regular urology floor.  The patient
received three doses of perioperative Kefzol.  She received a
Morphine PCA.  She was left NPO and had a nasogastric tube
placed to suction and a Foley catheter in place.

In the evening of the day of her surgery, the patient became
excessively somnolent and experienced a drop in oxygen
saturation.  It was determined that her ensuing hypercarbia
and hypoxia secondary to hypoventilation was caused by
narcotic overdose.  The patient received a number of doses of
Narcan to reverse the effects of the narcotics.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
closer care.  On Intensive Care Unit, the patient did fairly
well recovering from her narcotic overdose within the next
approximately twelve hours or so.  The rest of the time the
patient was alert and progressively improved. She did
complain of a decrease in hearing bilaterally.

It was determined by ENT consultation that the patient had
otitis media.  They told her to continue using her
Ciprofloxacin drops for her otitis externa and to use
decongestant and suggested that the otitis media would
improve when the nasogastric tube was removed.

It was also decided while in the Intensive Care Unit that the
patient would be scheduled for a sleep study after discharge
to be evaluated for sleep apnea as a possible exacerbating
factor for her hypoventilation hypercarbic hypoxic episode
the night of her surgery.

Over the course of the next few days, the patient started to
pass gas and her nasogastric tube and Foley catheter were
removed at the appropriate times.  She started a regular diet
which she appeared to tolerate well.  She also was able to be
started on some Percocet which she tolerated well.

It is now [**2131-5-10**], and the patient is in good condition.
She is being discharged.  She is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 261**]
in approximately two weeks.  She is to go for her sleep study
evaluation on Sunday night.  She is being sent home with
Percocet for pain.  She is also being sent home with Colace
to insure that her stools remain soft.  She is also being
told to continue her home medications including her
Ciprofloxacin drops for her ears.  She is also being told to
take Sudafed and Aspirin as needed to dry up her head
secretions.  She should avoid strenuous activity.  She should
not drive while on pain medications.  She may shower although
should not take baths.  She may observe a regular diet.
