Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6359**] was a same day admit and on [**8-19**] he was brought
directly to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3. Please see operative report for
surgical details. He tolerated the procedure and was transferred
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later
on op day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Post-operatively he had a low HCT with
increased chest tube output. He was given multiple transfusions
with RBCs and FFP. On post-op day one he was started on beta
blockers and was transferred to the SDU. On post-op day two his
chest tubes were removed. Post-op day three he was started on
diuretics and was diuresed towards his pre-op weight. His
epicardial pacing wires were removed and he was transfused
several units of RBCs for low HCT also on this day. On post-op
day four CXR revealed small apical pneumothorax that did not
increase in size by time of discharge. On post-op day five he
developed left knee pain and given his Gout history,
rheumatology was consulted. Joint fluid was aspirated and he was
started on Indomethacin. Fluid was negative. During entire
post-op course physical therapy followed patient for strength
and mobility. On post-op day six he appeared to be doing well
and was discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate
follow-up appointments.
