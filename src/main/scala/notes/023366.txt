Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be afebrile. Patient had lactate
drawn and was 4.4, so she was started on sepsis protocol, and
right IJ was placed.  She received 3 litres intravenous normal
saline, and subsequent lactate improved to 1.4.  Patient was
given ceftriaxone/azithromycin for possible infiltrate on chest
x-ray concerning for pneumonia, after blood cultures x 3 and
urine cultures were sent.  Pt found to have UTI. Given her HIV
history, she was also given treatment dose loading of TMP/SMX.
to both fungal and UTI coverage.  Further, given concern for
possible endocarditis, vancomycin and gentamicin were started.
Pt had TTE which did not show a vegetation on her valves.  Given
negative [**Location (un) **] criteria pt no longer needed coverage for
endocarditis. Pt was switched ot Unasyn and Azithromycin. Pt
also had concern for TB so pt placed on isolation and 3 sputum
cultures were ordered.
Given pts extensive polysubstance abuse, she had tox screens
done. She had a positive urine cocaine screen. There was concern
for drug withdrawal. Pt also had 2 Code purples due to agitated
violent behavior. Pt was found to have 2 crack pipes and a
spring loaded knife in her possesion. Pt started on 1:1 sitter.
Psych evaluated and she was placed on standing Ativan and
Haldol.
In addition, pt was noted to have multiple rashes on
extremities. Derm was consulted. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6**] [**Doctor First Name **] was positive. Further
workup for rheumatologic disorders begun.  Additionally she was
treated for sebborheic dermatitis and psoriasis.
Pt had complained of bilateral eye pain and was seen by optho
who felt that her pain may be secondary to old stable corneal
scars. She was started on lubricant drops.
.
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 course:
Pt was transferred to the floor on [**8-31**], and immediately
triggered a code purple before even being seen, and triggered 2
more that evening, appearing very anxious.  Overnight pt was
managed somewhat with ativan and haldol, but in the am started
setting off code purples again.  A review of her chart revealed
that she had not been on methadone as she stated she was on for
maintainance therapy.  She [**Doctor Last Name 8196**] admitted she gets methadone,
10mg a day, from a friend of hers that has low back pain.  She
has been taking this for at least 3 years.  At that time, on [**9-1**]
pt was started on methadone 10mg a day and after that point did
not cause another code purple.
From an infectious standpoint pt improved qiuckly and did not
have a cough at all on the floor, remained afebrile and without
an elevated white count.  The thinking was that the infection
most likely was an atypical pneumonia.  On [**9-2**] pt was swtiched
from unasyn to augmentin (in addition to azithromycin). On [**9-3**]
am, her third TB smear returned negative and pt was taking off
isolation precautions.  Upon dischrge ID's recommendation was to
complete therapy for pneumonia (aspiration vs. CAP) with a
course of augmentin for 10-14 days. Pt was sent out on a 4 day
course of abx for a total of 10 days.
On [**9-1**] pt was noticed to have an elevated potassium to 5.2.
This lab was thought to be due to hemolysis but the following
day the K came back at 5.5, recheck at 5.5 in the pm.  This was
thought to be possibly a drug related effect due to TMP-SMX
although unlikely given long-term use.  Per ID it may have been
due to unasyn which was d/c'd that morning.  TMP-SMX was also
decreased to normal strenght.  Renal insufficiency is another
possibility given that BUN was uptrending and creatinine was 1.0
which is a little bit high given her size.  She was promoted to
take in oral ingestion of fluids, recheck unchanged.  The
following am the labs were reassuring, and included K 4.9, BUN
23 (stable), Creat (1.1).
Pt's rashes remained stable and improved slowly on the floor.
Rheum labs were still pending at discharge.  I would encourage
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or derm to follow-up on these do decide if need further
work-up, treatment or a rheum consult. She had no further eye
pain.
The plan for discharge was for the patient to go to the Women's
Hope Program, but the bed fell through at the last minute;
therefore pt was instructed to call the Women's Hope Program
after discharge to schedule a bed.  This was discussed with the
social worker and care management for substance abuse treatment.
Pt was scheduled appointments with her PCP for HIV treatment and
follow-up as well as for her methadone maintainance for previous
IVDU.  Pt was given 2 days worth of methadone and klonopin as
she had been on these drugs long term.  I strongy recommended
against continued use of a benzodiazipine such as klonopin and
encouraged a discussion with pt's PCP regarding the need for
methadone maintainance preferrable with a methadone [**Hospital 8197**]
