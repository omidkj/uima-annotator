Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
87 year old female with coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, s/p mitral valve replacement, severe
aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.4cm), defibrillator in place, presenting
with progressive dyspnea on exertion.  Patient has presented to
be evaluated and determine if surgical management is an option
for her. She had been feeling quite short of breath before
admission, and had generally not been feeling herself. Two weeks
prior to admission, she was admitted to a [**Location (un) 30804**], NY ED for a
similar complaint and was diuresed with Lasix.  She felt much
better after leaving the hospital at that time, but
progressively got worse since being discharged.  She had been
getting short of breath on minimal activity with associated
substernal chest pressure.  Specifically, she used to be able to
ambulate around her house without any problem, but at the time
of admission could not walk more than five steps without getting
dyspneic.  She had also noted significant orthopnea and PND,
which seemed to get worse on the night before admisssion.  She
reported no chest pain, palpitations, or presyncope.  She noted
no dysuria or fever/chills.  There had been no URI symptoms, but
there was an occasional cough productive of clear sputum.  She
had also noted increased lower extremity swelling over the week
prior to admission.
.
Patient's cardiologist in NY noted that patient had been having
6 months to 1 year of progressive dyspnea.  Her last BNP was
500.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were pain 0, T 97.3, P 62, BP 168/70,
R 26, Sat 96%RA.  EKG showed regular, 65 beats per minute, ?
sinus, normal axis, TWI V4-V6 c/w prior.  Labs showed
leukocytosis and UA showing urinary tract infection, creatinine
at 1.4.  INR was supratherapeutic at 8.3.  Imaging was
significant for pleural effusion on left side and fluid
overload.  Patient was given 20mg IV lasix, and ceftriaxone for
an apparent UTI.
.
Vitals on transfer were P 64  R 18  BP 152/65  Sat 97/3L.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was less dyspneic than
previously, while on oxygen.  She noted no chest pain,
palpitations, or nausea.
.
On review of systems, she denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denied recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
