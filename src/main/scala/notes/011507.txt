Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Right leg pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of right subclavian central line.


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 35 year-old poorly compliant female well known to
[**Hospital1 18**] with h/o severe DM1, ESRD on PD, PVD with chronic ulcer

Pt recently admitted for hyperglycemia during which a right
femoral line was placed for IV access. Unclear but Pt left AMA
with her femoral line still in place. Pt was seen that day and
had it removed by a nurse in an unknown clinic. Pt stated that
she has been experiencing severe right leg [mainly inner thigh]
pain for four days PTA.  She described the pain as sharp and
continuous pain that wakes her from sleep. It was severe enough
that she was unable to walk [**1-4**] pain and weakness. Furthermore,
she states that she had this pain for sometime, thus preceding
placement of her femoral line. Additionally says that at times
she has LBP which thinks is [**1-4**] LP in the past. Remaining ROS
significant for her chronic diarrhea as well as some
lightheadedness and blood coming from her right ear with
decreased hearing. Pt denied fever. chills, abdominal pain,
hematochezia, melena, incontinence, SOB, CP.  She was admitted
to the medicine service for right leg pain and inability to
ambulate.

CXR [**4-28**]:
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are low lung volumes. The
heart size is unchanged from prior study. There is a left
retrocardiac opacity. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is
seen. There is prominence of the pulmonary vasculature,
consistent with mild CHF. The soft tissue and osseous structures
are stable in appearance.
IMPRESSION:
1) Mild CHF.
2) Retrocardiac opacity, which may represent pneumonia

CT abdomen/pelvis [**4-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence for retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal
hemorrhage.
2) Moderate amount of low-density fluid within the abdomen,
which represents ascites, or more likely a peritoneal dialysis
fluid. Peritoneal dialysis catheter terminating in the left
lower quadrant.
3) Anasarca.
4) Prominent lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and right
inguinal region of uncertain etiology and significance.

RLE U/S [**4-28**]:
IMPRESSION: Conglomeration of lymph nodes in the right groin.
Anasarca. No evidence for deep vein thrombosis.

Femoral U/S [**4-30**]:
The right groin region was interrogated using a linear
transducer. There is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or hematoma.

CT head [**4-30**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CXR [**4-30**]:
The previously identified left lower lobe pneumonia has been
improving. There is continued mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax is identified.

TTE [**4-30**]:
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular  systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with most likely  secondary to high output but aortic stenosis
cannot be excluded. No aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild  (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is  borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a  trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

AP PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP:
Exam consists of rotated AP film of the pelvis plus two
additional views of the right hip and proximal femur. No
fracture or bone destruction. No joint space narrowing.
Extensive vascular calcifications.

[**2204-5-10**]:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Compared to [**2204-4-30**]. The heart is
enlarged, but stable. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. There is patchy bibasilar atelectasis, not
significantly changed compared to the prior study. No definite
pneumonia is identified. There is mild prominence of the central
pulmonary vasculature, consistent with mild CHF/volume overload.
IMPRESSION:
1) Cardiomegaly with probable mild CHF/volume overload.
2) Bibasilar atelectasis. Patchy opacity on the right base
likely to rrepresent atelectasis, but early pneumonic infiltrate
not excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital days [**12-5**], including MICU course:
On admission, the pt. underwent a CT scan of the pelvis which
ruled-out a retroperitoneal bleed.  As she also presented with
leukocytosis, there was concern over localized abscess.
