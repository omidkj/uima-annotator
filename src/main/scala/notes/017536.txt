History of Present Illness:
68F with recurrent palate abscess.  The initial episode occurred
in [**10-14**] after pt had pain and swelling of her palate after
dental work.  She had the lesion drained at that time resulting
in complete resolution of swelling and symptoms.  Her symptoms
recurred with dental work in [**1-15**].  The lesion was again drained
and treated with penicillin with complete resolution of signs
and symptoms.  Her symptoms returned again last week which also
included a fever.  She had her lesion lanced and was treated
with clindamycin.  The following morning she woke with a
mouthful of blood, which ceased after compression.  It was noted
then that the patient was complaining of headache.  She had
vomited twice and a head CT showed diffuse frontal subarachnoid
hemorrhage and enlarged pituitary.

[**2200-10-1**] Head CT:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the distribution of the anterior
cerebral
artery.
2. No evidence of hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline
structures or
mass effect.
3. Right maxillary sinus opacification, which may be related to
right hard
palate abnormality. Would recommend dedicated facial bone scan
with contrast if clinically indicated to further evaluate this
lesion.

[**2200-10-2**] head CT:
1. Unchanged subarachnoid hemorrhage in the distribution of the
anterior
cerebral arteries.
2. Small hyperdensity in the right trigone consistent with small
amount of
intraventricular hematoma.
3. Right maxillary sinus opacification of unclear etiology.
Recommend
dedicated facial bone scan with contrast if clinically indicated
to further
evaluate this lesion.

[**2200-10-3**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in subarachnoid
hemorrhage and
likely small intraventricular hemorrhage compared to study of
one day prior.

[**2200-10-3**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2200-1-30**] the rate
has increased.

[**2200-10-3**] CXR:  IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion. Bibasilar
patchy atelectasis.

[**2200-10-4**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of subarachnoid
and intraventricular hemorrhage.

[**2200-10-6**] cerebral angiogram:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial aneurysm or arterial
vascular
malformation. No cause for subarachnoid hemorrhage identified.
The left
anterior cerebral artery territory was supplied by the right
anterior cerebral artery by way of the anterior communicating
artery. Again seen is a small infundibulum at the origin of the
right posterior communicating artery.


Brief Hospital Course:
68F with SAH on CT s/p palate abscess drainage.  She was
admitted to the neuro ICU for qhr checks.  Her INR was reversed
with FFP, platelets and vitamin K.  She was given Nimodipine to
maintain her SBP between 100 and 130.  She was given dilantin as
seizure prophylaxis.  Her repeat head CT's during her hospital
course showed that the hemorrhage was stable in appearance.  Her
clindamycin was continued for a course of total 7 days.  ENT was
consulted for her palate abscess.  They recommended follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99691**] in 2 weeks.  On HD6 pt received a cerebral
angiogram that showed no evidence of aneurysm.  She was
transferred to the floor on HD7.  PT and OT were consulted and
recommended rehab secondary to poor functional status.  She was
discharged to rehab in stable condition on [**2200-10-8**].
