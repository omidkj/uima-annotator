History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 64999**] is a 72-year-old male with a history of
ventricular arrhythmias and diminished ejection fraction. As he
has had increased exertional chest pain, he was admitted to an
outside hospital for management. He underwent cardiac
catheterization that showed severe three-vessel disease with an
occluded LAD and occluded right coronary artery. His ejection
fraction was estimated at 25%. He is now transferred for
high-risk coronary surgery.

[**2182-11-1**] Carotid Duplex Ultrasound
Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

[**2182-11-8**] CXR
There is a persistent very small left apical pneumothorax, which
is not significantly changed since the recent study of one day
earlier. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the
interval. There are minor atelectatic changes in the left lower
lobe, and note is made of small bilateral pleural effusions.
Linear air is seen within the retrosternal region, likely due to
the recent postoperative status of the patient.

[**2182-11-5**] EKG
Sinus rhythm
Low limb lead QRS voltages - is nonspecific
Probable prior inferior myocardial infarction
Poor R wave progression - is nondiagnostic but consider
Anteroseptal myocardial infarct, age indeterminate
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot exclude in part
anterior injury/
ischemia - clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2182-11-4**], precordial/anterior ST-T wave
changes appear more prominent


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 64999**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] via transfer from
[**Hospital6 33**] for surgical management of his coronary
artery disease. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner by the cardiac surgical service. Heparin was started for
anticoagulation. A carotid duplex ultrasound was obtained which
showed minimal disease of the bilateral internal carotid
arteries. On [**2182-11-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 64999**] was taken to the operating
room where he underwent three vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one,
Mr. [**Known lastname 64999**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated.
Beta blockade and aspirin were started. He became febrile and
was pancultured. Results of his cultures were negative and his
fevers resolved. On postoperative day three, he was transferred
to the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. Given his low ejection fraction and
history of ventricular arrythmia's, the electrophysiology
service was consulted. They will see him in 1 month for repeat
echocardiogram and further work-up. Amiodarone was started as an
antiarrhythmic. Mr. [**Known lastname 64999**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day seven. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
electrophysiology service and a cardiologist as an outpatient.
