post DCD renal transplant on [**2121-5-7**], recent
hospitalization for influenza A, CHF (EF=25-30%), presenting
with angioedema and difficulty breathing. As per pt's wife, he
started with swelling of his right cheek about 1-2 weeks ago; he
was seen by his PCP who suspected angioedema and started him on
prednisone/benadryl (4-d course). Wife reports some improvement
with this treatment. A day after this, he started to have pain
in his tooth (left upper molar), was seen by his dentist, and
started on penicillin for ?infection (with recommendation to see
oral surgeon). On day of admission, pt reports swelling of his
tongue, and his wife brought him to the [**Name (NI) **] at [**Name (NI) 620**]. There, he
was given solumedrol and benadryl, transferred here for further
care. He was dysarthric on presentation but in no respiratory
distress (stable vitals). He was seen by ENT, and airway was
thought to be adequate. He was continued on decadron and
benadryl, H2 blocker. On reevaluation by ENT, he was found to
have swelling of supraglottic area and tongue, and he was
brought to the OR for fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation. He was
brought to the ICU after this for further mgt.
.
Pt was started on Lisinopril many months ago; dose was recently
increased (last 1-2 months) to 5 mg. He was recently started on
Fe gluconate, and took some tussin over the weekend (also recent
PCN). Wife reports that he had some URI sx but no f/c/n/v. Pt
has also had diarrhea. On arrival to the ICU, he was intubated
and sedated.

Pertinent Results:
CXR: no evidence of pneumonia or CHF

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo male, h/o ESRD, CHF, presenting with angioedema after
recent increase in dose of ACE-I, s/p OR intubation for airway
protection
.
1. Angioedema - pt was intubated ENT in the OR under direct
visualization for airway protection.  This was thought to be
most likely related to ACE-I, a reaction that can present at any
time during treatment course.  He was started on IV decadron,
broad anti-histamines.  Although penicillin was felt to be less
likely, he was switched to clindamycin for treatment of the oral
infection.
Pt was ventilated without difficulty, release of pressure cuff
revealed progressively improved cuff leak.  Pt was extubated
succesfully and re-evaluation by ENT revealed improved swelling.
.
2. ESRD: Cr was monitored, found to be stable.
- continued [**Last Name (un) **], cellcept for immunosupression, rapamycin level
found to be 5.7
- continued bactrim for infectious prophylaxis.
- PTH found to be elevated and Vitamin D nl at 21.
- noted to have exposed Left upper extremity graft, transplant
surgery [**Name (NI) 653**], will see patient as outpatient for elective
revision.
.
3. CAD: continued ASA, pt initially tahycardic, however then
developed asymptomatic bradycardia to 50's, so metoprolol was
held.  This resolved spontaneously and metoprolol was restarted
at home dose without redevelopment of bradycardia.
.
4. CHF, systolic: euvolemic, no need for diuresis during his
stay.
.
5. Hyponatremia - noted to develop hyponatremia with Na to 126,
urime osm 592, appears euvolemic, likely [**2-12**] SIADH. Stopped IVF
fluids, improved with fluid restriction.
.
6. Anemia - pt noted to have decrease in HCT from 29.9 to 25, no
evidence of active bleeding.  Iron studies were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease.

6. PPX: SQ hep, H2 blocker, bowel meds
.
7. Code: FULL
