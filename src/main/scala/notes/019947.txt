Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**]
Chief Complaint:
anaphylaxis and hyperallergic pneumonitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 48 year old female with past medical history
significant for asthma (intubation x 4), severe allergies,
remote seizure (s/p head injury), sickle cell trait, and
thrombophilia (with DVT and PE) who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU
having been transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  The patient was
apparently in her usual state of good health and attending a
conference on HIV (she is an infection disease physician) until
she returned to her hotel room, smelled a noxious cleaning
[**Doctor Last Name 360**], and suddenly experienced neck swelling, shortness of
breath, a cough, and collapsed shortly after calling for help.
She does report having injected herself with her epinephrine pen
which she carries always given her allergy history.  At the
outside hospital, the patient had high res CT images taken which
showed a bilaterally diffuse infiltrative process.  There was
also a question of ground glass opacities.  Chest xray revealed
bilaterally diffuse infiltrates as well.  Bronchoalveolar lavage
was performed whose results are pending at the time of this
summary.  The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ICU for further evaluation.

Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
1) PULMONARY: Etiology of the patient's acute shortness of
breath was attributed to a combination of hyperallergenic
pneumonitis, status asthmaticus, and anaphylaxis.  High
resolution CT images were reviewed by radiology and it was felt
that the bilaterally diffuse infiltrates were consistent with
the above although a maligant process could not be ruled out.
The patient was intubated at presentation, and she was extubated
on [**8-5**] after it was shown that her throat edema had decreased
(cuff leak present).  Between intubation and extubation, she was
treated with high dose steroids, histamine blockers,
levofloxacin, and nebulizers.  She maintained oxygen saturations
well throughout her hospital course, always maintaining
saturations in the upper 90%.  Infectious etiologies were also
considered, but the patient was negative for legionella and
cryptococcus.  Repeat chest xrays showed clearing of the
infiltrative process.  She was on high dose steroids (> 100
mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) for 7 day, then began a 5
day steroid taper to off.  She did not have flaring of her
pulmonary process during the taper.

2) HEMATOLOGY: The patient has been in a hypercoagulable state
due to the genetic disorder described above.  She was kept on
anticoagulation throughout her hospital stay.  She informed the
staff that she was recently seen by her primary care physician
who performed dopplers of her lower extremities where it was
found that she had no occlusions.  As such, she was sent on her
regular dose of 100 mg daily. The patient was found to be anemic
on presentation with a Hct of 25.0.  Iron studies were
suggestive of chronic disease.  Hct increased to 28.6 at
discharge without intervention.

3) LINE INFECTION: At the outside hospital a femoral central
catheter was placed.  Multiple blood cultures drawn in the ICU
were positive for coagulase negative staph (oxacillin
resistant).  The femoral line was pulled and the tip culture
also grew this organism.  The patient received an 8 day course
of Vancomycin IV.  She remained afebrile with normal blood
pressure throughout her hospital stay.  TTE [**2104-8-12**] negative for
vegetation.

4) PSYCHOTIC EPISODE: Patient developed a strange affect while
in the intensive care unit.  She remained oriented x 3 the
entire time, but did not make complete sense.  She was started
on Zyprexa daily.  Upon transfer to the floor, she became
agitated and was observed to be pinching herself and banging on
the walls.  A single dose of IV Haldol was given to which the
patient had a dystonic reaction (jaw clenching, drooling, and
arm stiffness).  Benadryl was immediately given with relief
within 5 minutes or so.  Patient slept most of the day.  There
was some question of seizure vs. dystonia, as patient has a
remote h/o seizures in the past.  EEG was done the following
morning - results still pending.  Psychiatry was consulted and
they felt this was likely delirium/psychosis and confirmed
history of steroid-induced psychosis with patient's outside
psychiatrist.  After 2 days of steroid taper, patient's mental
status began to clear and she was baseline by the time of
discharge.  Patient reports that she feels depressed but denies
suicidal ideation.  She will discuss starting an SSRI with her
PCP.


5) DIARRHEA: Developed after being on Vanco IV x 4 or 5 days.
C. difficile toxin was negative x 1, however started empiric
treatment of Flagyl 500 mg po tid.  Will continue to complete a
10 day course.  Diarrhea has resolved by the time of discharge.
