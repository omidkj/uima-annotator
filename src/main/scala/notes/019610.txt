REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 0.8 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 3.5 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 65% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.4 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Gradient: 15 mm Hg
Aortic Valve - LVOT Diam: 2.3 cm

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function
(LVEF>55%). [**Known lastname 4460**] LV cavity. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Systolic
motion of the
mitral chordae (normal variant). No resting LVOT gradient. No
[**Male First Name (un) **] of mitral
valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). The left
ventricular cavity is somewhat [**Known lastname **] consistent with a decreased
preload.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is chordal [**Male First Name (un) **] without LVOT obstruction. There is no systolic
anterior motion
of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent staging laparoscopy, open cholecystecetomy and
pylorus preserving whipple resection [**3-16**] for pancreatic cancer.
Patient was kept intubated overnight for pressor requirement,
but was successfully extubated on POD1 and off pressors. Patient
then recovered on an accelerated course. He was transferred to
the floor on POD2 and then followed the whipple pathway. Had a
PCa for pain, was on IVF with an NGT and ambulating. Patient
ambulated early and well. Had NGT dc'd on POD4 and started on
clears. Was advanced to fulls on POD5, started on reglan,
colace, and his pre-op beta-blocker. PCA was dc'd and he was
switched to po pain meds. IVF were stopped. JP amylase was
checked and foudn to be four, so the JP was dc'd upon discahrge
on POD7. Patient was eating regular diet and doign very well.
Was given instruciton to follow- up in two weeks with dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
