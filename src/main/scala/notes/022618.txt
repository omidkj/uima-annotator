Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Intermittent slow ventricular tachycardia
Syncopal episodes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
75 yo male with HTN, HL, myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], aortic stenois and
CAD s/p CABG/AVR on [**2122-11-5**] presented to ED on [**2122-11-25**] after
being found to have ventricular tachycardia while at his
cardiologist's office on the day of admission. Patient had been
feeling fatigued for the past week prior to admission, and also
had reported decreased appetite during that same time frame.
.
Patient also reported having had two syncopal episodes recently,
the first one week after the recent operation and the second one
occurring five days prior to admission. Patient had never had
syncopal episodes in the past. Both events occurred when patient
was sitting down and then bent over; he did not report any
prodromal symptoms and he was unconscious for about 5 seconds
each time (patient's wife was at his side when both events
occurred). There was no post-ictal state or bladder/bowel
incontinence after the episodes. In the second syncopal episode,
he hit the right side of his head on the edge of the door, but
did not see a doctor until the day of admission. While at clinic
on the day of admission, an EKG was performed which showed
wide-complex ventricular tachycardia at 110 bpm and he was found
to be hypotensive; patient was asymptomatic at the time. He was
transfered to [**Hospital 81629**] Hospital ED for further management and
observation; while on his way to the OSH, pt spontaneously
converted to sinus rhythm. He was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further observation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were temperature of 97.2, heart rate
of 131, blood pressure of 89/64, respiratory rate of 18 and
oxygen saturation of 93% on 2L. He received 500 mg NS bolus in
Nashoha ED before transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and his blood pressure
improved to 93/58. The EKG at clinic showed wide QRS complex
ventricular tachycardia at 110 bpm which is different from prior
EKG.
.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative except those mentioned in HPI.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema or palpitations.

EKG:
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 3:50 PM: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality.
Intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation may
be left anterior fascicular block. The QTc interval appears
prolonged but is difficult to measure. Cannot exclude myocardial
ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous
tracing of [**2122-11-5**] intraventricular conduction delay appears
slightly less prominent and QRS voltage more prominent.
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 7:32 PM: Wide complex tachycardia consistent with
ventricular tachycardia. Since the previous tracing of same
date, wide complex tachycardia is now present.
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 8:02 PM: Wide complex tachycardia consistent with
ventricular tachycardia with a brief pause followed by a
probable sinus conducted beat and then resumption of wide
complex tachycardia. Since the previous tracing of same date
there is no significant change.
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 8:09 PM: Sinus bradycardia. Left atrial
abnormality. Modest intraventricular conduction delay with left
axis deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block.
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of
same date wide complex tachycardia is now absent.
- [**2122-11-25**] @ 9:19 PM: Wide complex tachycardia consistent with
ventricular tachycardia. Since the previous tracing of same date
ventricular tachycardia is now present.
- [**2122-11-26**] @ 8:10 AM: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality.
Slight intraventricular conduction delay with left axis
deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities. The QTc
interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure. Cannot
exclude myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2122-11-25**] ventricular tachycardia
is now absent.
