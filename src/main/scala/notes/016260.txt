Bactrim / Remeron

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11455**] is an 84 y/o man with PMH notable for CAD s/p
MI ([**2174**]), type 2 DM, hypertension, PVD, and chronic atrial
fibrillation on [**Year (4 digits) **] who presents to the ED from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab after being discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] less than 24hr prior to
representation. On [**10-3**] he was admitted with hypotension
(BP80s/50s) attributed to a combination of dehydration,
urosepsis, and partial SBO. He was initially treated broadly
with vancomycin and zosyn. This was tapered to Bactrim to which
he developed a drug rash and was finally changed to Cipro for
UTI (to be completed on [**10-18**]). In terms of his SBO, he was seen
by surgery who recommended medical treatment with NGT and NPO as
diet. His bowel was decompressed and he began to have BMs prior
to d/c. Stool was positive for C. diff and he was sent home on
flagyl to be continued until after completion of other
antibiotics.

He presents today with a chief complaint of worsening dyspnea.
At rehab he was noted to have increased WOB, RR 22-24 with O2
sat 70%. He was initially taken to OSH where he reportedly
complained of chest pain and shortness of breath. He was given
Lasix 10mg PO. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care. En route was hypoxic to 74% on RA to 80s on NRB. EMS gave
40mg IV lasix and SL NTG. After nitro BP dropped to 80s
systolic.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS were T100, HR 99, BP 80/49, R31, O2sat 95% NRB.
BP improved to 92/57, HR 99. He was started on CPAP and given
Levofloxacin/Flagyl for possible UTI/PNA. He was also given an
aspirin.


Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11455**] is an 84 y/o man with history of CAD s/p MI,
HTN, hypercholesterolemia and recent admission for UTI,
hypotension, partial SBO admitted with shortness of breath
likely due to pulmonary edema +/- pneumonia in setting of IVF
overload.  Course complicated by difficulty weaning oxygen.  CT
chest showed collapsed L lobe with large bilateral effusions.

# Hypoxemia/Respiratory distress: Likely due to pulmonary edema
+/- pneumonia (possibly aspiration) in the setting of
neuromuscular weakness from multiple recent hospitalizations,
nutritional deficiency, and post-polio.  Last echocardiogram
done in [**5-/2184**] with normal EF 60%, no evidence of diastolic
dysfunction, repeat done on [**10-18**] showed new moderate pulmonary
hypertension and [**2-3**]+TR, otherwise unchanged.  Negative 6-7L
since admission.  CT chest showed large regions of atelectasis
within the lower lobes [**3-5**] mucus within the segmental and
subsegmental airways and bilateral pleural effusions.  Patient
underwent IR guided thoracentesis on [**10-24**], removal of 2L.  He
was electively intubated on [**10-25**] for PEG procedure and
bronchoscopy was done with copious removal of mucus.  He was
extubated the following day and was maintained on intermittent
CPAP.  He completed a 10 day course of IV vnacomycin for MRSA
PNA.  Hypoxia initially improved although patient had recurrent
mucus plugging and frequent desaturations during his ICU course
secondary to LLL collapse.  Eventually, when his BP tolerated,
he was diuresed successfully with IV lasix drip. One day prior
to discharge, patient was transitioned from lasix drip to IV
lasix boluses of 40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] with goal of 500cc-1L
negative daily. He was followed daily with [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes in
the setting of aggressive diuresis. Upon discharge, patient's
respiratory status improved significantly and was requiring
between 2-4L oxygen by nasal canula.

# Cardiac: The patient has a h/o NSTEMI attributed to AF with
RVR.  He was maintained on aspirin.  His [**Hospital1 **] was held given
his acute illness and the planned PEG placement on [**2184-10-25**].  He
was started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation but was
eventually stopped because of bloody secretions, a 7 point
hematocrit drop, and guiac positive stools. Regarding future
anticoagulation, patient should have a repeat colonoscopy as an
outpatient and readdress anticoagulation as an outpatient. Given
his guiac positive stools and discussion with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
discontinued.  Regarding his heart rate control, he was
maintained on metoprolol when his BP tolerated.  For much of his
ICU course this was held but was restarted as his BP tolerated.
He was restarted on metoprolol 12.5mg PO bid several days prior
to discharge. This may be titrated up as his blood pressure
tolerates.

# Anemia: Over the course of his admission, pt's hematocrit
slowly trended downward to a nadir of 21.4. He was transfused
one unit of pRBCs with a 1 point increase in his hematocrit.
Patient is recommended to have a repeat colonoscopy as an
outpatient.   He should have CBC's checked every other day for
the next week and transfused for hct <24.  If transfusion
needed, it should be given with a dose of IV lasix.

# C. diff: Loose stool on admission.  Presented with elevated
WBC count to 25, now down to 13.  Had been treated for C. diff
last admission, positive on culture from [**10-7**].  C. diff negative
x2.  No diarrhea currently.  The patient was continued on
PO vancomycin (concern for resistant C. diff), PO flagyl.  The
plan was for both PO flagyl and PO vanco to be continued 1 week
after other antibiotics are stopped.  C diff toxin B was
positive and patient was recommended to continue PO vancomycin
and flagyl through [**2184-11-18**], 2 weeks after completing his
antibiotic course. He was also starte
