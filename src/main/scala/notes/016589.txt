Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was a direct admit and on [**2105-12-14**] she was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 3, aortic valve replacement and aortic root enlargment.
Please see op note for surgical details. Pt was transferred to
the CSRU in stable condition on Milrinone, Epinephrine, and
Neosynephrine. Pt remained intubated until post-op day two when
she was weaned off of Propofol and mechanical ventilation and
extubated. She was neurologically intact. Following extubation
she required aggressive pulmonary toilet with nebulizers, Lasix,
IS and needed additional oxygen support via NC. Pt. required
extended inotropic support and was finally weaned off of all
pressors by post-op day four. She was transferred to the
telemetry floor on post-operative day four. She had an episode
of atrial fibrillation on post-op day five which converted back

had serosanguinous drainage from her sternal wound which

a 10 day course of Levaquin. She had severe pedal edema and was
treated with IV Lasix and responded well.  She was discharged to
