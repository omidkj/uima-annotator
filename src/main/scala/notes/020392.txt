.
TTE [**2161-2-12**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion with
fibrin
deposits on the surface of the heart.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of
[**2161-2-12**], there has been no significant change.
.
Ankle/foot/hip xr
1.  Status post right hip arthroplasty with a bipolar hip
prosthesis.  No
evidence of hardware loosening.
2.  Old fracture of the distal fifth right metatarsal.  No
evidence of
osteomyelitis in the right foot or ankle, but bone scan may be
considered if clinical suspicion is high.
.
CXR:
1.  There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which may
reflect an
element of cardiomegaly and associated pericardial effusion.
2.  There is haziness at the left costophrenic angle, consistent
with
atelectasis and probable very small effusion.
.
TEE [**2161-2-18**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. Two discrete, 5-10mml [**Last Name (un) **], filamentous, and highly
mobile  echodensities are noted on the right atrial lead in the
body of the right
atrium c/w vegetations or thrombi. A tiny secundum atrial septal
defect (ASD) is present. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch and descending  thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but without discrete vegetation. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild [1+] mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Filamentous, mobile, echodensities on the RA pacing
lead c/w
thrombus or vegetation.
.
Bone Scan:
Findings consistent with osteomyelitis of the lateral aspect of
the right ankle.
.
LE US b/l:
Findings indicating old thrombus involving the right superficial
femoral and popliteal veins, no acute venous thrombosis
involving either lower extremity.
.
CTA chest [**2163-2-20**]
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Moderate-to-large pericardial effusion.
3.  Calcified splenic artery.
4.  Likely atelectasis of the left lung base.
.
CTA abdomen [**2163-2-21**]
1.  No evidence for septic emboli or abscess.
2.  Left adrenal lesion, incompletely characterized.  Further
evaluation is recommended with MRI examination.
3.  No significant change in the large pericardial effusion and
left basilar effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: Most likely cause was sepsis. Ddx included
tamponade but bedside echo in the ED revealed 1-2 cm
circumferential pericardial effusion, without evidence of
tamponade or RV collapse. WBC elevated at 16 and OSH blood
cultures taken 6 days prior to presentation to [**Location (un) **] returned
[**3-19**] positive for MRSA. Received Vancomycin, Dopamin gtt, Zosyn,
decadron 4 mg IV. R SCL central line placed and pt started on
sepsis protocol given hypotension, although Lactate only 1.3 and
pt afebrile.
In the MICU, the patient was volume repleted and his pressors
weaned. Levaquin was added to the vancomycin that was started in
the ED but this was stopped shortly thereafter as the pt
improved only on vanco. He was started on synthroid
supplementation as TSH was high and FT4 low. He received another
ECHO demonstrating no change since his ER ECHO. As he was doing
better following fluid repletion and was maintaining his
pressure w/out support, he was called out to the floor for
further management of his condition. On the floor the pt
continued to be normotensive and Aldactone and Lasix were
restarted. Pulsus paradoxus remained within normal limits. A
repeat TTE was done and showed moderate to large pericardial
effusion with marked interval increase. Further workup as below.
.
2. MRSA bacteremia: Suspected source of MRSA bacteremia included
recent complicated pacemaker placement at OSH (?causing chronic
pericardial effusion) vs. sacral decubitus ulcer vs. vs. LE
cellulitis vs. hx osteomyelitis R 2nd toe vs. infected hardware
in R hip. Ankle/foot/hip x-rays w/out evidence of osteo. TTE was
negative for vegetations. A TEE was positive for filamentous,
mobile, echodensities on the RA pacing lead c/w thrombus or
vegetation. An ID consult was obtained and it was recommended to
add on Rifampin 300mg [**Hospital1 **]. It was suggested to remove the device
but this was not pursued as the risk of the proced
