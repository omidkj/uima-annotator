History of Present Illness:
Mr. B is a 62 yo Polish speaking man who was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from CC7 for Mask ventilation after an acute respiratory
decompensation. He has a h/o COPD(last FEV1 1.27, 41% of
predicted), tracheomalicia s/p stent removal ([**1-5**]) and CAD s/p
RCA stent and echo with LVEF 25-30%([**8-5**]). He p/w 3 weeks of
SOB, difficulty breathing and cough. Initially on [**3-14**], he was
placed on PO steroids with a two week taper as an outpatient for
a presumed COPD exacerbation [**3-6**] a viral URI. He
self-discontinued the steroids three days prior to his most
recent admission on [**3-28**], when he represented with worsening SOB
and productive cough characterized by green sputum. At that
time, ABG 7.35/51/92. He was started on 60mg prednisone, azithro
and nebs. He was improving slowly until his standing nebs
treatment was d/c and he was started on Spiriva. On [**4-2**], after
missing nebs o/n, he became tachypneic and had difficulty
breathing. He was restarted on nebs and ABG showed 7.29/65/72.
After starting BiPAP on the floor, his breathing improved and
ABG 7.39/44/77. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for airway
management. Responded to BiPAP well, and was weaned to NC with
O2 96% on 3L. Now breathing comfortably on 3L O2--> called out
to Medicine floor on [**2154-4-5**].

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p RCA stent ([**8-5**]); echo prior to stent LVEF 25-30%
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
tracheobronchial malacia - confirmed on flexible bronchoscopy
with dynamic airway studies. A tracheal stent was placed on
[**2153-12-26**]. However the patient had worsening of his
cough with the stent with continued productive cough so the
stent was removed on [**2154-1-16**].
COPD

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old with h/o COPD, CAD s/p cath, tracheomalacia s/p
recent stent removal, who presented with COPD exacerbation.

1) COPD Exacerbation- He was doing well on PO steroids and
completed a course of azithromycin but after missing a night of
nebulizer treatment, he underwent respiratory decompensation
requiring mask ventilation.  He responded well to BiPAP with ABG
7.39/44/89. He subsequently did well off BiPAP and was weaned
off nasal cannula oxygen support. Subsequent O2 sats remained
>93%. He was placed on steroid taper with prednisone and
continued on albuterol/atrovent nebulizers. He continued to have
mild wheezes on exam, but subjectively was breathing more
comfortably upon discharge. He will complete a 2 week steroid
taper and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11616**] on [**2154-4-18**].

2) Rising BUN/Cr: Cr initially 1.3 up from 1.0 at baseline. BUN
was 49 up from 38. This was thought to be due to pre-renal
etiology and his creatinine subsequently improved to 1.0 with
fluid repletion.

4) CAD: Cardiac enzymes x 3 were negative with no EKG changes.
He remains chest pain free. He was continued on ASA, lipitor,
Ace-I. B-Blocker held given his COPD.

5) Anxiety- Continued on Ativan and Xanax

6) HTN: Initially SBP low in 90's, likely dehydrational in
nature. Held Lisinopril due to elevated creatinine. Re-started
at 10mg daily lisinopril in addition to diltiazem at 120mg [**Hospital1 **].
BP well-controlled upon discharge.

7) Chronic low back pain: Continued on Vicodin prn as per
outpatient regimen

8) Hyperglycemia: High blood sugars in the setting of steroids
(BG's=200's). HgbA1C=6.7. Started on Metformin 500mg daily prior
to discharge with good effect (blood sugars 130's-170's).
Patient does not want to go home on sliding scale insulin, so we
will continue on Metformin regimen as outpatient. He will f/u in
clinic in 2 weeks to re-evaluate his blood sugars off of steroid
taper.
