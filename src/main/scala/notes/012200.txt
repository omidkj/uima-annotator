Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Elective intubation for ERCP
3 failed extubation attempts followed by re-intubation
Open trachesotomy placement

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o F with a history of COPD on home oxygen, lung cancer,
hypertension, diabetes, morbid obesity who presented today for
ERCP for RUQ abdominal pain. She was electively intubated given
her history of severe COPD. Post ERCP she was extubated and was
on her way to the recovery room when she became tachypneic and
oxygen saturation dropped into 80s, she also was having a good
amount of pink frothy sputum, of note she only received 800cc of
fluid during the ERCP.

An ECG was obtained which was initially concerning for ischemic
changes. A CXR showed left pleural effusion and cardiomegaly.
She was re-intubated given her oxygen saturations, no blood gas
was drawn prior to re-intubation. She was given ASA, furosemide
and labs were sent including cardiac enzymes. Of note she was
placed on propofol and her BP was in the 90s. An arterial line
was also placed.

TTE [**2103-6-20**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
C. Cath [**2103-6-21**]: FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are angiographically normal.
2. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
CXR [**2103-6-30**]: IMPRESSION: Persistent CHF. Unchanged left lower
lung opacity and left-sided pleural effusion.
.
ERCP [**2103-6-18**]: Impression: Partial pancreatogram revealed normal
pancreatic duct. Moderate biliary dilation compatible with
benign papillary stenosis.
Sludge in the CBD. Successful biliary sphincterotomy. Successful
sludge extraction using a 15mm balloon.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a  80 year old female with severe COPD, diabetes,
lung cancer, morbid obesity, who presents to ICU s/p ERCP in
setting of hypoxia and reintubation
.
#. Respiratory Failure: the patient initially was distressed
upon extubation after her ECRP complicated by hypertension. She
was reintubated and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She was able to be weaned
rather rapidly, and she did well on an SBT for over 1 hour prior
to being extubated for the second time. Within 1.5 hours of this
however, she developed extreme respiratory distress with
hypertension requiring re-intubation. At this time, the
physiology was felt to be that the patient was volume overloaded
and carried an amount of diastolic dysfunction, such that when
she was extubated, she had an increased venous return with loss
of peep that she was unable to handle well, resulting in sudden
pulmonary edema. The respiratory distress, in turn, resulted in
marked hypertension, refractory to nitro gtt, which only
worsened her pulmonary edema. The plan at this point was to
leave the patient intubated until we had effectively diuresed
her in order to maximize her chance for successful
re-extubation. She was placed on a lasix gtt and was diuresed
about 10L. She was weaned again to 0/0, which she breathed
successfully on for about 1 hour. She had a cuff leak prior to
extubation, and we were able to verify with the patient herself
that if she were unsuccessfully extubated that she would want
reintubation and ?trach. Upon extubation for the 3rd time, she
initially did well, but within 15 minutes developed stridor. She
was given epi nebs, decadron 6mg IVx1 and heliox, but the
respiratory distress worsened, and once again, the patient had a
marked elevation in blood pressures refractory to nitro gtt. She
did not seem to have any pulmonary edema. Upon reintubation by
anesthesia, there was significant laryngeal edema. She once
again did well, weaning rapidly, and underwent open tracheostomy
on [**2103-6-27**]. Upon discharge to pulmonary rehab, she was able to
wear her passy muir valve for several hours a day and to take
soft solids by mouth.
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: the patient required
massive diuresis on a lasix gtt to optimize her volume status
and continues to still be volume overloaded on exam. She will
require careful attention to her volume status upon transfer to
pulmonary rehab. She was reinitiated on her outpatient does of
lasix, 40mg [**Hospital1 **], prior to discharge.
.
# NSTEMI: the patient, upon her second extubation and subsequent
respiratory failure, developed a LBBB on ekg, and elevated
cardiac enzymes. She was initiated on a heparin gtt, plavix,
high dose statin and aspirin. Beta blockade was also initiated.
Cardiology was consulted who felt that the patient likely had
rate and pressure related demand changes on the ekg, which was
also consistent with the LBBB resolution upon blood pressure and
heart rate control. Nonetheless, she was taken to cath to rule
out significant CAD, as the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**
