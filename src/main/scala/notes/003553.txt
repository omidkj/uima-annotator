Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69 yo WF with h/o idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
and severe pulmonary HTN who presented with hypoxia, SOB and c/o
cough. She had previously been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55911**] at
[**Hospital6 16029**] in [**Location (un) 5583**]. SOB has been progressive
over a period of years since being diagnosed with IPF and PH in
[**2124**]. Since then, her O2 requirement has steadily gone up from
2L NC to 12 L NC. Over the past few weeks, she has been unable
to walk more than a few steps before being winded and is now
unable to sit up in bed without dyspnea. She also c/o worsening
cough with green-yellowish sputum as well as nasal discharge and
chest congestion for the past 10 days. Denies fevers, chills,
sick contacts and no recent travel. As per patient, she had CT
chest performed in [**2-21**] that showed a stable appearance of her
lungs. Recent TTE reportedly measured pulmonary artery systolic
pressures of 81 mmHg, PCWP 42 mm Hg. Pulmonologist then
prescribed Tracleer and Rivatio (Sildenafil) which she has not
taken due to her fear of medication side effects. She also
wishes to have another opinion by a pulmonologist here at [**Hospital1 18**].
She explains that she has been rejected as a possible recipient
at 2 lung transplant centers, once because of her age and the
last because of her weight. She is still being evaluated at the
[**State 78655**] for a possible bilateral lung transplant.

In the ED, patient was afebrile, RR 20, O2 sat 92% on 8L NC.
However, she markedly desaturated to 70% with coughing and
removal of O2 with eating. She was placed on 80% FM with
improvement in saturations to 95%. Given O2 requirement and
extreme of hypoxic values she was admitted to MICU for further
care. ROS was otherwise notable for urinary frequency and panic
attacks.

[**2127-7-10**] UA: negative

EKG - NSR @ 70 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST elevations or
depressions, TWI III, aVF, no priors for comparison.
.
CT chest [**2-21**] (from [**Hospital6 16029**]) - essentially
stable appearance of the lungs with fibrotic change,
honeycombing, and intralobular septal thickening compatible with
known diagnosis. Interval improvement in patchy airspace disease
in the superior segments of bilateral lower lobes as compared
with prior CT.

CT chest [**2127-7-10**]: Extensive reticular opacities and honeycombing
with multifocal ground glass opacities bilaterally. Overall, CT
shows worsening of fibrosis as compared to [**2-21**] CT

[**2127-7-10**] CXR (AP) :  In comparison with the study of [**7-10**],
allowing for differences in technique, there is no interval
change. Again, there is extensive reticular opacification
persisting throughout both lungs, consistent with the clinical
history of pulmonary fibrosis.

[**2127-7-10**]: TTE results : left and right atrium moderately dilated.
RA pressure 10-20mmHg. Mild symmetric LVH. LVEF 60-70%. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis and 1+ AR. Severe 3+ TR seen. Severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (60-95%). Dilated PA. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. No
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 69 yo WF with h/o idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis, severe pulmonary HTN who presented with hypoxia, SOB,
cough who continued to improve clinically with oxygen
saturations consistently >90% on support, was also given
sildenafil with some clinical improvement initially, discharged
with pulmonary follow up.
.
# SOB/hypoxia - patient had poor pulmonary reserve at baseline
given setting of her idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis/usual
interstitial pneumonitis and severe pulmonary hypertension. She
has history of noncompliance and has collected a plethora of
input from multiple major medical facilities regarding her
prognosis and diagnosis. She had not followed up with treatment
recommendations from pulmonologist at [**Hospital1 11485**] and was not
taking bronchodilators, inhalers, or steroids at this time. She
states she has had prior course of azithromycin for bronchitis
and pneumonia with improvement in her symptoms. Despite
saturations in 70s on arrival to ED patient very stable on Fio2
40% facemask with sats > 93%.  As per pulmonary consult, patient
was started on sildenafil, steriods, high flow facemask with
home oxygen.  The patient was discharged with pulmonary follow
up.
.
# Cough - Chest congestion, cough improving.  Patient completed
a course of azithromycin.
.
# Anxiety - Reasonable considering severity of disease and
oxygen requirement. If exacerbates, will seek further
intervenion.  Patient was started on benzodiazepines as needed.
.
# HTN - Sildenafil started for pulmonary HTN in MICU. As also
lowers BP, beta-blocker dose reduced. Patient not happy with
this, as she feels increased heart rate is contributing to her
increased oxygen demand.  Sildenafil continued at decreased dose
until discharge.
.
# Hypothyroidism - Continued synthroid.
