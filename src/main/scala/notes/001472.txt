Date of Birth:  [**2062-6-28**]             Sex:   F

Service: [**Year (4 digits) 662**]

Allergies:
Aspirin / Compazine / spironolactone

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertension, Fluid overload

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
68F with CAD s/p CABG in [**2129**], diastolic CHF (EF >55%), h/o CVA
with left sided weakness, HTN, HLD, T2DM on insulin and CKD who
presents with chest pain and was found to be hypertensive and
volume overloaded in the ED.  She reports that since Wednesday
[**1-10**] she has been having substernal chest pressure at rest.
She has been receiving SL nitro for the past few days at her [**Hospital1 1501**]
which has relieved the chest pressure.  She has not walked since
leaving the hospital on [**1-2**], so she cannot express whether the
CP is worse with exertion.  She also reports feeling worsening
SOB over the past 4-5 days.  She has not previously has to wear
oxygen until the past 4-5 days.  At home, she has 6 pillow
orthopnea and reports waking up feeling suddenly short of breath
on occasion.  She states that she has been requesting to take
torsemide for the past few days because she feels more fluid in
her lungs and in her legs, and she was just restarted on
torsemide 20mg PO on Friday, 2 days PTA.  She reports good
adherence to a low sodium diet at rehab.
.
On the day of admission, she was not able to keep down any of
her PO medications because of nausea and vomiting, which was
clear and non-bloody.  She also reported that she felt
lightheaded today without vertigo.
.
In the ED, there was initially concern for aortic dissection
given decreased right radial pulse compared to the left.  A
non-contrast CT chest was ordered which showed no evidence of
dissection but showed moderate pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.
 Cardiology was consulted and she was started on a nitro gtt for
hypertension and likely CHF exacerbation
.
She was recently admitted from [**2130-12-29**] to [**2131-1-2**] for right leg
pain and hyperkalemia.  During this admission, her sironolactone
and torsemide were stopped because of elevated potassium and
creatinine, respectively.  She was instructed to continue
holding these medications after discharge and has not taken them
since.  At her last admission 2 weeks ago, both discharge and
admission systolic BPs were noted to be in the 150s. In the past
year she has had multiple recorded systolic BPs in the 160-180s
at various outpatient appointments.  However, at her [**2130-12-27**]
visit in the heart failure clinic, her BP was noted to be
114/68.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. S/he denies recent fevers or rigors. S/he denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope.
