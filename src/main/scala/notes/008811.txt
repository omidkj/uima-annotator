CT Head [**2196-3-8**]
IMPRESSION: Non-displaced fracture of the right anterior
maxillary wall
associated with right maxillary sinus blood. Consider facial CT
characterization.

CT Cervical spine [**2196-3-8**]
IMPRESSION: Hairline fracture of C2 left pedicle/lamina.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2196-3-8**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Sternal and first rib fractures raise the possibility of
cardiac
contusion. No evidence of mediastinal blood in this limited
study.

2. Right pulmonary contusion/multifocal pulmonary hemorrhage.
Recommend
CT / CXR followup to assess progression/resolution.

3. Left clavicle fracture

4. Abdominal solid organs intact.

ECHO  [**2196-3-8**]
 LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. Nl
interventricular septal motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Emergency study. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. Interventricular septal motion is normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. No
pericardial effusion.

Renal U/S [**2196-3-8**]
Portable scans were performed at the bedside showing the right
kidney to
measure 10.8 cm in length and the left kidney 11.4 cm. There is
no evidence
of hydronephrosis or renal stone disease. No masses or
perinephric fluid
collections are seen. Both kidneys show vascularization on color
flow
imaging. The bladder was empty via a Foley catheter.

CONCLUSION: Normal-sized kidneys without evidence of
obstruction.

Chest xray [**2196-3-10**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the patient
has been
extubated and a nasogastric tube has been placed. The right
hemidiaphragm is now better seen, suggesting a decrease in
extent of the pre-existing right effusion. The extensive right
upper lobe opacity is unchanged in
extent. Also unchanged is the apical portion of a right pleural
effusion.
The left lung shows no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities,
except for
minimal retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged size of the cardiac
silhouette.









Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service. Plastics consulted for
the eyelid laceration; this was irrigated and sutured. He will
follow up in a week in [**Hospital 3595**] clinic. His clavicle fracture
was evaluated by Orthopedics and was managed nonoperative with a
sling. He will follow up in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic in [**1-12**] weeks
time. It was initially thought that he may have a very small;
hairline fracture through C2 pedicle, further imaging using MRI
was done and no fractures of the spine were noted. He was
clinically without any symptoms and his cervical collar was
cleared as a result.

He did suffer significant chest wall injuries and required
moderate doses of narcotics for pain control. He was eventually
placed on an oral pain regimen which was effective in
controlling his pain.

A renal ultrasound was performed secondary to low urinary output
and was negative for any hydronephrosis or obstructive process.
He was eventually able to void without any difficulty. He also
underwent an ECHO which revealed preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
systolic function and no pericardial effusion.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and was cleared for
discharge to home. Follow up instructions were provided to
patient at time of discharge.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
s/p Rollover motor vehicle crash
Right eyelid laceration
Right maxillary sinus fracture
Pulmonary contusion
Left clavicle fracture
Sternal fracture
Bilateral 1st rib fractures


Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet, pain
adequately controlled.


Discharge Instructions:
DO NOT bear any weight on your left arm because of your
fracture. Wear the sling for comfort.

It is very important that you cough, deep breathe and use the
incentive spirometer 10x every hour while you are awake.

You should walk at least 4-5x/day throughout the day. Sitting up
in a chair vs lying down throughotu the day will help promote
better expansion of your lungs.

Return to the Emergency room if you develop any fevers, chills,
productive cough, increased pain not relieved by the pain
medication, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
and/or any other symptoms that are not concerning to you.

AVOID any alcohol, illicit drug use, driving and/or operating
any heavy machinery while you are taking the n

Followup Instructions:
Follow up in [**12-11**] weeks in [**Hospital 3595**] clinic for your eyelid
laceration and facial fracture. Call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5343**] for an
appointment.

Follow up in 2 weeks i
