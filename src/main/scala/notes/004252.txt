History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman admitted for MS changes on [**10-17**].  In the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED she was found to have a infiltrate on CXR and dirty UA
therefore started on levofloxacin and flagyl. Lactate was 1.0.
She was given levoquin, flagyl and kayexalate for her high
potassium (5.7). Also in the ED, SW spoke with the [**Hospital1 9168**] who went
into the patient's home who reported that home showed evidence
of hoarding with hallways and stairs filled with boxes of food.
[**Hospital1 9168**] reports that there was no trash or dirt among the items and
that the home was clean. Pt lives with her daughter who was home
at the time of [**Name (NI) 9168**] visit.

Daughter, [**Name (NI) 714**], reports that she is the pts primary
caretaker in the home with the only assistnce being 5 hours of
PCA through Family Services and ETHOS, and once a week visits
from her sister who lives in [**Name (NI) 3307**]. She states that she
started to increase her mothers Haldol and tylenol and codeine
as of Friday in order to help her sleep at approximately 3 times
her baseline doses. Has held her Lasix and Glyburide. Pt had
decreased PO intake at home. Daughter has been in contact with
ETHOS and with the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] came to house this morning
in reponse to an email from daughter. Daughter states very
clearly that she is having a hard time caring for her mother at
home, and is interested in pursuing placement for her mother
from the hospital. Daughter is also concerned about $300 copay
required by insurance if pt is admitted. SW provided support to
daughter and discussed anticipated course of care if pt is
hospitalized. Daughter is aware that keeping pt at home is no
longer working and is willing to explore options for placement.
Daughther is expressing indicators of caregiver burnout and is
aware of this and actively seeking help and support from
available services.

[**10-17**] CXR IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2128-9-16**]:
There is extensive multifocal consolidation in the lungs, most
marked in the right apex but also in the right and left lower
lung zones most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  Small
left pleural effusion is new.  Moderate
cardiomegaly is chronic.  Findings were discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] by
telephone at the time of dictation.
.
[**10-17**] CT head IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2.  Evidence of age-related atrophic changes.
3.  Findings suggestive of bilateral chronic small vessel
ischemic infarcts in
the cerebral white matter, as well as lacunar infarcts.
4.  Right maxillary sinus disease.
.
[**10-18**] CT head IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial
hemorrhage or other acute abnormality.  Please see the prior
report for findings consistent with chronic bilateral infarcts
and right maxillary sinus disease.  No significant change since
the prior day.
.
[**10-19**] CXR IMPRESSION:  New pulmonary edema, worsening multifocal
pneumonia, enlarging bilateral effusions
.
[**10-20**] CXR IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**10-17**] and
30th: Moderately severe pulmonary edema has improved slightly
since [**10-19**] at 10:02 p.m., but multifocal pneumonia is
unchanged.  There is a component of atelectasis in the right
upper lobe where simple pneumonia was demonstrated on [**10-17**] and the same is probably true in the left upper lobe.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable and a moderate-sized left
pleural effusion which developed since [**10-17**] is stable
subsequently.  ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric
tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Tip of the
left jugular line projects over the left brachiocephalic vein.
No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment [**Age over 90 **] year old woman admitted for MS changes with U/A
consistent with UTI and CXR consistent with multifocal PNA.
.
## Pneumonia.  As per CXR on admission, patient had extensive
multifocal consolidation in the lungs.  She was started on
Flagyl and Levoquin for atypical and community aquired PNA
coverage.  The patient had intermittent fevers throughout the
hospital course.  We repeated CXRs daily and her PNA progressed
despite antibiotic coverage, and she was switched to
Vancomycin/Zosyn on [**10-19**].  Ongoing discussion with her daughter
involved goals of care and whether or not to intubate if that
became necessary.  On the morning of [**10-19**], she became short of
breath with desaturations into the 70s and was transferred to
the MICU, initially for non-invasive ventilation. Patient's ABG
was notable for respiratory acidosis 7.29/78/71 repeat
7.21/78/71 on 4L face mask. Repeat CXR showed persistent
multilobar PNA with new LUL infiltrate, no overt evidence of
CHF. Patient received nebulizer treatment, Lasix, and
antibiotics were switched to Zosyn, Flagyl, and Vancomycin.
Daughter (HCP) was made aware of the situation by housetaff and
confirmed DNR/DNI status.  Later on the day of transfer to the
ICU, the patient had increasing respiratory distress while on
non-invasive ventilation, and her daughter requested that she be
intubated.  Anesthesia was called, and she was intubated without
complications.  The patient's code status at that time remained
DNR (no CPR or shocks, pressors were acceptable).  Over the next
1-2 days she became more hypotensive and displayed septic
physiology, ultimately requiring pressors to maintain her blood
pressure.  On [**10-21**] the patietn's daughter and family made the
decision to withdraw care.  Morphine was given for comfort, the
patient was extubated, and all other medications were stopped.
The patient died on [**2129-10-21**] at 9:55pm.
.
## UTI. UA had 6-10 WBCs and Pos nitrite and mod bacteria on
admission.  Her Urine culture eventually grew pansensitive
e.coli.  She was originally placed on Levoquin for UTI.  Urine
was negative for Legionella on HD #3.
.
## Hyperkalemia/Hyponatremia.  Patient was thought to be
dehydrated on admission given poor PO intake at home.  SIADH was
also a possible etiology of hyponatremia.  She was given
kayexalate in ED.  We free water restricted her to 1.5L and used
NS for
