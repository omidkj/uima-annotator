History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 50yo M with PMHx significant for alcohol abuse and
CAD with multiple MI's, prior MI [**2105**] with OM stent, and PCI at
[**Hospital1 18**] [**2109-4-20**] of the proximal RCA and mid-RCA (both Taxus),
LAD stent at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2105**]. The patient initially was in the
[**Hospital 5353**] Hospital ED on [**9-8**] with chest pain. EKG showed  NSR,
nonspecific ST-T changes per report. The paitent left AMA before
further w/u was done. He then presented to [**Hospital3 **] via
EMS on [**9-15**] with increase lethergy and jaundice for the last
three days. He was transfeed to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for a GIB and a HCT of
21. He was transfused before transfer with 1 unit.
.
From the medicine admission note:
Pt states he has never had liver problems or h/o jaundice, but
has taken about 14 tylenol over past week for chronic back pain.
Pt reports he was on an alcohol binge while in [**Location (un) 5354**] one
week ago. Around the time he came back he developed chest pain
and was seen in the [**Hospital3 **] ED where chest pain resolved
with NG and he was discharged. Pt is very unclear about this -
states that he had an MI but was only given SL NG and was
discharged without admission. [**Hospital3 **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
they currently have no record of EKGs or other records
indicating that pt was seen one week ago - at last communication
with RN in ED of [**Hospital1 **], it was felt that perphaps visit had not
yet been logged in to computer and will need to contact again
tomorrow. Since that time he developed melena and jaundice. He
denies dizziness or chest pain but in the [**Hospital3 **] ED he
was found to have elevated LFTs, Hct of 22, received 1u PRBC and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here pt refused EGD and NG lavage. In
[**Hospital1 18**] ED received 2u PRBC, octreotide and PPIs as well as KCL
for hypokalemia, N-acetylcysteine for elevated tylenol levels,
and antibiotics for bandemia. RUQ showed gall baldder sludge but
no bilary dilation. He was felt to have no ascites and so was
not tapped. After receiving the two units of PRBC he desaturated
to from 96% to 88% on RA. Received Lasix for volume overload
.
The paitent was then admitted to a medicine team via NF. He
recieved a total of 3 transfusions here and his and his HCT has
only gone up from 22.6 to 25.2. Also, he has having multiple
episodes of melana. He went for an EGD today ([**9-16**]) but was not
coorperative despite midazloam 3mg and meperidene 75mg.  He also
started to have hallucinations on the floor. Therefore, he was
tx to the MICU for closer monitoring and intubation for EGD.
.
.
ROS: denies CP, SOP, abd pain. Per wife, he always hs wheezing,
not dx with a lung condition. He has been having increasing
swelling in his left lower leg for the past 6 months.

Past Medical History:
-alcohol abuse - pt reports that he drinks 2-3 beers per day,
denies DTs. no prior history of liver disease
-CAD s/p MI [**2105**], stent LAD [**2107**], stent mid and prox RCA in [**2108**]

- Per wife, in [**2082**], the patient had a motorcycle accident and
broke his femur and had compartment syndrome leading to a
fasicotomy in the right lower leg. He has had multiple DVT's
since in that leg.
- herniated lumbar disc with sciatica, on chronic pain
medications

Micro:

Radiology:
[**9-15**] RUQ US:  Echogenic liver consistent with fatty
infiltration.  Other forms of liver disease including hepatitis
and severe hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this
examination.  Nondistended gallbladder containing sludge.
Associated mild gallbladder wall edema is a non-specific finding
which can be seen in low albumin states. No definite evidence
for cholecystitis.

[**9-17**] echo: EF 40%, 1. The left atrium is normal in size. The
left atrium is elongated. The right  atrium is markedly dilated.
 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly  depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include basal and mid  inferior and
inferolateral akinesis..  3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation  is seen.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral  regurgitation is seen.  5.Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary  artery
systolic hypertension.  6.There is no pericardial effusion.

[**9-17**] CT abd: 1.  Markedly fatty liver containing a
subcentimeter hypodense lesion that is too small to accurately
characterize.  An additional focus of hyperdensity anteriorly
within segment IV is incompletely characterized, and could
represent a focus of fatty sparing.  6 month follow up CT is
recommended. 2.  No evidence of mesenteric vascular occlusion or
secondary signs of mesenteric ischemia.
3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.

[**9-21**] renal US: The right and left kidneys measure 12.8 and 13.2
cm
respectively without evidence of stones, masses or
hydronephrosis.

[**9-25**] CT torso: 1.  Patchy bilateral pulmonary opacities and
dense bilateral lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation,
findings that suggest infectious process superimposed upon
atelectasis.  Bilateral pleural effusions. 2.  Fatty
infiltration of the liver.  Interval increase in intraabdominal
ascites. 3.  No definite evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
Two foci of gas within the right lower quadrant are likely
located within decompressed and non-opacified loops of small
bowel.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a 50yo man with anemia, GI bleed, liver
insufficiency, hyperbilirubinemia, bandemia, elevated troponin
with new EKG changes, desaturation consistent with volume
overload, alcohol abuse. Could not tolerate EGD therefore
transferred to the MICU for intubation and EGD.

1.  Blood loss Anemia and GI bleed-
