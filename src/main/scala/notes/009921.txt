TAH/BSO/staging for endometrial CA
Central Line placement

History of Present Illness:
76 yo GO found to have thickened endometrium on CT done for
surveillance due to history of breast cancer. CT also showed
bilateral ovarian cysts. Pt's CA-125 was elevated at 22 in [**2-23**] in [**4-24**]. D&C [**2127-5-26**] revealed endometrial adenocarcinoma. Pt
presents now for TAH/BSO/staging for endometrial CA.

2. Osteoporosis with mult compression fx of vertebrae
3. OA of shoulder, hip s/p R hip replacement
4. A Fib, parox, on amio but no anticoag given fall hx and risk

6. Chronic hypoxia, followed by Pulm
7. Chronic recurrent b/l pleural effusions, s/p taps and
biopsies with no evid of malignancy

Physical Exam:
Pre-admission PE
GENERAL:  She appeared well and was moderately overweight.  She
was in no acute distress.
SKIN:  Sclerae anicteric.  Lymph node survey was negative.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nondistended and without palpable masses.
EXTREMITIES:  Without edema.
PELVIC:  The vulva and vagina were normal.  The cervix was very
difficult to visualize, as the vagina was quite narrow and the
apex was quite high.  In addition, the patient had a great deal
of difficulty in fully relaxing.  Despite several attempts, the
speculum could not be positioned such that the cervix was
exposed.  Any attempt at endometrial biopsy was therefore
abandoned.  Bimanual examination was similarly limited.  The
vaginal walls were smooth, and the cervix was normal to
palpation.  There were no palpable pelvic masses.
RECTAL:  Examination was confirmatory.  There was no cul-de-sac
nodularity and the rectum was intrinsically normal.
