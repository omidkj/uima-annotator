HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56 year old
Caucasian female with a history of hypothyroidism, atrial
fibrillation and a large hepatic cyst, who underwent
attempted laparoscopic cystectomy and marsupialization of the
cyst at an outside institution.  This was complicated by
conversion to an open procedure secondary to difficult
dissection, but the open procedure was complicated by a large
hemorrhage presumably from the hilar area of the liver.  This
required massive resuscitation and blood transfusion.
Eventually patient was discharged home and returned several
weeks later with jaundice and ascites.  A bile leak was
identified.  Bile was aspirated from the peritoneal cavity
and a transampullary stent was placed.  Despite this she
continued to have ongoing jaundice and biliary leak and she
was transferred to this facility for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She arrived on [**11-29**] late in the
evening.  She was admitted to the intensive care unit.  At
that time she had marked ascites and jaundice.  She underwent
a CAT scan of the abdomen which demonstrated a large cystic
appearing lesion within the medial segment of the left lobe
and the anterior segment of the right lobe of the liver as
well as a large amount of ascites.  The following day she was
taken to the interventional suite where she underwent
placement right and left percutaneous transhepatic catheters.
These were unable to cross the stenosis located in the hilum.
The following 48 hours later she was taken back to the
interventional suite where the catheters were advanced across
the stenosis in the right main and left main hepatic duct and
the catheters transversed the stenosis and entered the
duodenum.

At this time she was unable to aspirate the fluid in the
peritoneal cavity and due to continued fever and elevated
white count, she was taken to the operating room on the 10th
where 5 liters of free flowing bile was found in the
peritoneal cavity.  There was also a large abscess located in
the right subphrenic space.  A J-tube was placed at this time
as well as multiple catheters in the subphrenic space on the
right side as well as in Morison pouch to collect any
residual abscess.  She tolerated this well and was extubated
and taken to the surgical intensive care unit where she
remained.

Over the next several days she required increasing oxygen
support and eventually was placed on a ventilator.  Cultures
of the abscess and the bile grew out Enterococcus that was
sensitive to vancomycin.  She had multiple episodes of
diarrhea which had been treated for C.diff colitis at the
outside institution and the cultures did not grow Clostridium
difficile at this institution.  Five days postoperatively the
J-tube fell out and attempts were made to percutaneously
replace it in interventional radiology and these were
unsuccessful.

During the remainder of her hospital course she had several
episodes of fever and elevated white count that prompted
further imaging studies and no residual abscess within the
peritoneal cavity could be documented.  The [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drains located inferior to the lateral segment of the left
lobe of the liver and in Morison pouch were removed, leaving
only the abscess drain in the subphrenic space.  The
transhepatic catheters continued to remain open to gravity
drainage.  Strictures were identified in the right main and
left main hepatic ducts.  These were balloon dilated with
minimal residual stenosis.

Due to continued fever and chills, she was taken back to the
interventional suite where an 8 French pigtail catheter was
placed into the remnant cyst cavity.  This presumably had
become the source of the bile leak as well as abscess.  The
catheter drained approximately 40 to 50 cc of bile stained
fluid on a daily basis, the cultures of which also grew
Enterococcus and gram negative rods.  She remained on IV
antibiotic therapy and supportive treatment for some time.

Eventually she was able to be weaned from the ventilator and
extubated.  She was transferred to the floor where she
remained on the floor for approximately seven to 10 days
where she received physical therapy.  The transhepatic
catheters were internalized and her bilirubin remained
slightly elevated, but did not bump any higher.

On [**2160-1-18**] she was able to be discharged home.  She was
discharged home with followup instructions by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
