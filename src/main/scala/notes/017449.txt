Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72 year old male with
a past medical history significant for diabetes who presents
status post catheterization, mid left anterior descending
stent who was having acute anterior ST elevation and mild
history of chest pressure times 24 hours.  The patient states
on the day prior to admission he was walking his dog when he
developed substernal chest pain with dyspnea on exertion.  At
the time he thought the pain was secondary to nutrition.  The
pain was ameliorated with rest, but did not entirely resolve.
The pain continued over night and the following morning he
developed a worsening crushing chest pain radiating down both
arms into his back.  Review of systems was significant for
nausea, not vomiting, and mild diaphoresis.

He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room in [**Doctor Last Name **],
[**State 350**].  There electrocardiogram showed ST segment
elevations in V1 through V5.  He was treated with Lopressor
intravenously, 2 mg of intravenous Morphine times three,
nitroglycerin drip, Plavix 300 mg and Integrilin bolus.  The
patient with persistent chest pain on this regimen.  Primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 53420**] performed cardiac echocardiogram
and he was airlifted to [**Hospital6 256**].
The patient was taken straight to catheterization where he
was found to have a 90% mid left anterior descending
stenosis, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stenting with 2.25 by 18 mm Hepacote stent post-dilated to
2.5 mm.  The patient was then transferred to CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes on Glyburide.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Glyburide.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remote 10 year pack history of smoking.
Weak alcoholic consumption, 8 beers/week.  Lives alone, next
to son's business.  He works parttime.  Wife died two years
ago.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of stroke, had an myocardial
infarction at the age of 70.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98, blood pressure 178/64,
heart rate 63, respirations 18 and 6% on room air.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Clear oropharynx, mucous
membranes moist.
Cardiovascular:  Jugulovenous pressure at 7 cm, regular
rhythm.  II/VI systolic ejection murmur at upper right
sternal border.  Normal S1 and S2.
Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes or
crackles appreciated.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended and bowel sounds
present.
Extremities:  Catheterization site intact.  Dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses, 1+ bilaterally, no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.
Neurological:  Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm at 54
beats/minute, normal intervals, left axis deviation,  ST
elevation at 4 mm in leads V2 to V4 with T wave inversions,
Qs in 3 and Arteriovenous fistula.  Sodium 141, potassium
4.4, chloride 106, bicarbonate 21, BUN 16, creatinine 1.0,
glucose 202, hematocrit 43.5, platelets 242, INR 1.8.  Serial
creatinine kinase showed 663 to 1270 to 700.  Serial CKMBs
were as follows, 108 to 182 to 60.  Troponin T 1.13.
Echocardiogram:  Let atrium was mildly dilated.  There was
severe regional left ventricular dysfunction with ejection
fraction of 25 to 30%.  Apex in the mid and distal anterior
wall and anterior septum are akinetic, aneurysmal.  The
remaining walls contract well.  No thrombus seen.  Right
ventricular chamber size is normal.  Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.  The aortic valve was extremely
thickened.  There was no aortic calcinosis.  The trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve appears structurally
normal.  Trivial mitral regurgitation.  The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests improved axis, there is n pericardial
effusion.

Cardiac catheterization: (Comments)  1. Selective coronary
angiography, right dominant system revealed two vessel
coronary artery disease.  Left main coronary artery had no
angiographically flow of main disease.  Left anterior
descending had 20% ostial stenosis with 90% mid vessel
thrombotic lesion beyond which there was normal flow.  The
distal vessel had moderate to severe diffuse disease.  The
left circumflex coronary artery had mid luminal
irregularities.  The right coronary artery was a dominant
vessel and heart disease about 20% proximal stenosis.  The
posterior descending coronary artery had 100% stenosis and
filled robustly from right to left and left to right
collaterals.  There was a 50% stenosis of the distal
posterolateral branch.  2.  Resting hemodynamic pressures
revealed minimally elevated left-sided filling pressures with
no evidence of central aortic hypertension.  3.  The mid left
anterior descending stenosis was successfully treated with
angioplasty and stenting using a 2.25 by 18 mm Hepacote
stent, post-dilated to 2.5 mm.  Final angiography revealed no
residual stenosis within the stent, no angiographic evidence
of dissection with normal flow.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - The patient was
admitted directly to the Emergency Department and taken to
the Catheterization Unit where the patient had a percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent treatment to his
left anterior descending.  The patient was subsequently
transferred to the CCU for further management and monitoring.
The patient was transferred to the CCU on Integrilin, Plavix,
with heparin started once internal infusion was complete.
The patient was also started on aspirin, beta blocker, Ace
inhibitor as well as statin. Once the patient was
transitioned to heparin he was started on Coumadin as the
patient would need a six month anticoagulation due to his low
ejection fraction of 25 to 30% after having sustained his
myocardial infarction.  The patient had Metoprolol and the
ACE inhibitor titrated up as tolerated and subsequently
changed to a q. day dosing of each medication prior to
discharge.  The patient had arterial sheaths pulled without
any complications, no evidence of hematoma and
neurovascularly intact in the lower extremities.  Given the
patient's low ejection fraction our goal involving status was
to keep him even to slightly negative.  The patient was
considered to be evenly making and he had mild pulmonary
artery diastolic pressures that were elevated.  The patient's
goal INR was 2 to 3.  The patient transitioned over to
Lovenox treatments and the patient was given Lovenox
teaching.  [**Hospital6 407**] was arranged to come to
his home and check INR levels for goal INR levels of 2 to 3.
It was recommended to the patient that he follow up with an
electrophysiologist as an outpatient to further restratefy
him and further evaluate whether he would need an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator placement in the near future.  The
patient is to have repeat echocardiogram in three to four
weeks, no arrhythmias noted on telemetry throughout
hospitalization.

2.  Endocrine - The patient was maintained on a regular
insulin sliding scale and started on his Glyburide the
following morning  Blood sugars were within range.
Fingersticks were done q.i.d.

3.  Prophylaxis - The patient was continued on heparin and
subsequently switched to Lovenox therapy.  He was also
started on Coumadin.

4.  Physical therapy - Physical therapy was consulted and
they recommended discharge to home with outpatient cardiac
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Anterior wall myocardial infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Status post percutaneous coronary intervention.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
