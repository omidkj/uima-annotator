altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
78yo man with cerebellar and throacic spinal RCC metastasis, s/p
recent spinal mass decompression (vertebrectomy and
instrumentation) on [**8-3**] presented with difficulty in speech.
Recently discharged on [**8-8**] from [**Hospital1 **] to [**Hospital 100**] rehab C after
spinal surgery as noted above. Per report, following surgery, he
has been well, walking speaking as usual. On the morning of
admission, he was found to have have difficulty in speech,
confusion and generalized weakness, but especially in the upper
extremities, noted by the rehab staff.
.
In the ED: Temp 101 HR 96 162/73. CXR showed retrocardiac
opacity rx. Head CT showed interval development of layering high
density within occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of left lateral ventricle
worrisome for small hemorrhage. Cerebellar mets were somewhat
improved from previous. Neurosurgery consulted, change in mental
status thought to be secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy
ensuing from infection and interevention not recommended. In the
ICU, pt started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin for empiric
treatment of pneumonia and pansensitive ecoli. On day of
transfer, febrile to 101.1.
.
Currently reports non-productive cough. Denies nausea,
vomitting, diarrhea, dysuria, back pain



Past Medical History:
Renal cell cancer with cerebellar metastasis:
During work up for sepsis in [**7-/2168**] was found to have a left
renal mass. He subsequently underwent nephrectomy in [**2168-11-7**].
He was
diagnosed with a bladder metastasis in [**1-/2169**], which was per
the
patient's report, resected cystoscopically. In [**6-/2169**] he was
diagnosed with spinal metastases in his lumbar and thoracic
spine, and eventually in [**10/2169**] these metastases became
clinically relevant, and he was started on dexamethasone and
received radiation therapy. This occurred at [**Hospital3 13503**], and he received proton beam radiation. In
[**11/2169**], he was diagnosed with brain metastases and received
whole brain radiation. He had been on Sutent since [**2170-4-10**],
also on Zometa, last dose on [**2170-7-2**].

Data:
Head CT [**8-11**]:
1.  Interval development of layering high density within the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle may represent tiny
focus of hemorrhage.  No other intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage
identified.
2.  Known left cerebellar metastasis less conspicuous compared
to [**2170-4-10**] study.  Clearly, a contrast enhanced examination
will be more capable of revealing a more subtle metastatic
lesion than the present non-contrast study.
.
CXR: New left retrocardiac opacity and small left-sided pleural
effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
78yo man with metastatic RCC with metastases to the left
cerebellum, thoracic spine, s/p recent spinal mass decompression
(vertebrectomy and instrumentation) admitted with delerium
secondary to PNA and GNR bactermia.  MS is improving on
Zosyn/Vanco.
.
PNA and GNR bacteremia.  On admission the patient had a CXR
consistent with pneumonia and was started on zosyn and
vancomycin empirically.  Blood cultures from [**8-11**] grew [**3-14**]
bottles of pansensitive ecoli and he was switched to
levofloxacin.  However, on [**8-16**] due to continued confusion,
levofloxacin was discontinued (given theoretical risk of altered
mental status with levofloxacin) and was continued on
ceftriaxone.  He was switched to a PO regimen of Cefpodoxime on
[**8-22**] and was discharged with instructions to complete a 14 day
course.  For pt's pneumonia, he was given levofloxacin, followed
by ceftriaxone. He also completed a 10 day course of flagyl for
presumed aspiration pneumonia.
.
Delerium.  On admission the patient was noted to have difficulty
with his speech and with confusion.  He was initially admitted
to the ICU because of a questionable cerebral bleed.  However,
upon evaluation by neurosurgery and neuroogy, the MRI finding of
left lateral ventricular hemorrhage and brain metastases were
thought not to be the cause of his mental status changes.  His
confusion was thought mostly secondary to toxic-metabolic
etiologies, most notably his infection.  Decadron was also
thought to be compoundign his delerium and thus his decadron was
tapered.
.
HTN. Pt's hypertension was poorly controlled early on during his
admission.  His lisinopril was titrated up to 20, and he was
started on norvasc 10, and metoprolol 75 [**Hospital1 **].
.
RCC.  Patient has extensive metastases to brain, thoracic spine,
bladder.  His decadron fgor post-op edema following spine
surgery was tapered from 2 mg PO BID to 1 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Pt's staples
from his vertebral surgery were removed on [**8-20**].  Pt has been
scheduled a follow up appointment with radiation oncology.
.
Colitis.  On his last day of hospitalization, he was found to
have c diff positive x 1.  Because he had been receiving flagyl
for aspiration pneumonia for a 10 day course, he was started on
PO vancomycin for a 10 day course.
