AM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Grade 3 liver laceration with active extravasation resulting
in
intraperitoneal hematoma.  As a result, the IVC is collapsed and
the adrenals are hyperenhancing consistent with
hypovolemia/hypoperfusion.
2.  Stranding of the small bowel mesentery, with fluid seen
between leaves of a mesentery and small foci of active
extravasation concerning for mesenteric injury. Enteric injury
is not excluded, though no free air is seen.
3.  Diastasis of the pubic symphysis, disruption of the right
sacroiliac joint and right sacral fracture, with multiple foci
of active extravasation within the pelvis resulting in a large
pelvic hematoma.
4.  Non-displaced posterior rib fractures of the first and
second ribs and left third rib, without mediastinal hematoma or
evidence of great vessel injury.
5.  Left L2 and L3 spinous process fractures and T4 and T5
spinous process avulsion fractures.
6.  Partially visualized right acromion and scapular fractures.

There is levoscoliosis with reversal of cervical lordosis.
There is asymmetry in the atlanto-occipital joints, right being
slightly wider than the left. there is also mild widening of the
lateral atlanto-axial joints on both sides; however, symmetric.

      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin
based on
         the detection of inducible resistance .
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to the trauma ICU under the Acute
Care Surgery service for close monitoring. He remained in the
ICU until [**2141-7-26**] when he was stable both hemodynamically and
from a respiratory standpoint, at which time he was transferred
to the surgical floor. He is medically stable and ready for
discharge on [**2141-7-28**]. His hospital course is summarized by
systems below:

Neuro: He was intubated and sedated. He was intermittently
paralyzed in order to optimize vent synchronization. Once his
sedation was weaned, he slowly became more responsive
mental-status wise. He responded appropriately to his family and
eventually to nursing. He was started on standing serquel which
was changed to prn as his agitation improved. At the time of
discharge he is alert, interactive and following commands.
On his admission c-spine CT scan, widening at the
atlanto-occipital joint was noted. He remained in c-collar and
neurosurgery was consulted, who recommended that he remain in
the hard c-collar for 1 month.

Pulm: He was intubated and mechanically ventilated. He had
increasing vent requirements and a CT scan showed ARDS. He was
started on ARDS protocol for vent settings and his oxygenation
improved. He was also treated for a VAP, with cultures initially
growing MSSA & proteus. Repeat sputum culture also showed MSSA.
He continued on a high PEEP due to his ARDS and he was started
on a lasix gtt in order to improve oxygenation. He continued to
diurese well. He was weaned off of the vent until he tolerated
trach mask for almost 24 hours starting on [**7-24**]. On transfer to
the floor his oxygenation wa
