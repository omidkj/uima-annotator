Service:  MICU
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
woman with a history of bronchogenic adenocarcinoma, status
post left lower lobe resection in [**2120-7-7**] complicated by
pneumonia and failure to wean from the ventilator.  She is
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation Center at

The patient's course status post her left lower lobe
adenocarcinoma resection was notable for multiple episodes of
respiratory failure which required re-intubation.  She also
had multiple episodes of pneumonia.  She had a tracheostomy
and jejunostomy tube placed in [**2120-7-7**].  From that
point, the patient has had a prolonged course in which she

Her course at [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitation Center is
notable for decreased hematocrit and guaiac positive stools.
Her Coumadin had been stopped, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
was unsuccessful and the barium swallow was deferred
secondary to high aspiration risk.  The patient was on
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation which had developed
postoperatively but resolved after initiation of Amiodarone.

The patient also had a right sided thoracentesis for a large
(greater than 2 liters) pleural effusion.  She had rapid re-
accumulation of this effusion which was by report a
transudate.

The patient did have sputum which grew Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient also had stool that was positive for C.
difficile.  The patient also had recurrent urinary tract
infection most recently with Klebsiella which was treated
with a 5 day course of Zosyn just prior to admission here.

Family reports that at baseline the patient is deaf but is
able to communicate through writing and lip [**Location (un) 1131**].  They
have noted no recent changes in her mental status.  They have
become frustrated that she has not been able to progress off
the ventilator and are requesting further evaluation at [**Hospital1 1444**].

tactile stimulation the patient closes her eyes tightly.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was initially diuresed with an
extra dose of Lasix the day of her admission.  She was then
sent for a CT scan of her chest on [**2120-12-13**] and this showed
the following.  Question of a left lingular bronchus
partially obstructing lesion.  Ground glass opacity changes
mostly in the upper lobes, predominantly the right upper
lobe.  Generally aside from the right upper lobe findings,
the parenchyma is much improved compared to a CT scan from
[**2120-8-7**].  There is question of overinflation of the
cuff of her tracheostomy.  There is interval increase in the
right sided pleural effusion with interval decrease in her
left sided pleural effusion.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2120-12-16**], which
revealed a somewhat concerning appearance to a heaped up type
lesion at the left lower lobe stump.  This lesion was
biopsied times three given its somewhat concerning
appearance.  The tissue at this lesion was not friable nor
did it bleed in an abnormal way.  The biopsies are pending at
the time of dictation.

The patient was put on trials of trach mask.  The patient
surprisingly tolerated these trials on trach mask quite well.
 She was generally rested over night on SIMV, however, during
the day she was able to tolerate trach mask for several hours
during the day.  We will continue to put her on trials of
trach mask off the ventilator as tolerated while she is still
at [**Hospital1 69**].  On the day of
discharge from the [**Hospital1 18**], she tolerated trach collar >24 hours
(including overnight).

It is possible that some component of pulmonary edema from
congestive heart failure may be impeding her ability to wean.
Bronchoscopy otherwise revealed areas of thick mucous plugs
which were clear in appearance and not purulent.  Also, the
Pulmonary Interventional Service will evaluate the patient on
[**2120-12-17**] to change her trach collar to a different size so
that there is no leak as a leak had been noted around the
trach collar, however, the CT scan suggested her cuff is
overinflated.  They suggested the size of the trach is
actually somewhat small for her airway.

2.  Cardiovascular:  There were no acute cardiovascular
issues during this admission.  As noted we did try some mild
extra diuresis and changed her Lasix to twice a day dose
while here.  She generally maintained a negative fluid
balance over 24 hour period.  There was no recurrence of
atrial fibrillation during this admission.

The patient had a transthoracic echo, which otherwise
unchanged from previous echocardiograms at this institution
as well as [**Hospital1 **], revealed question of a left
atrial mass.  It was not entirely clear from the views on the
TTE as to the nature of this mass, however, upon review with
cardiology attending, the mass did not appear to be
displaying paradoxical motion within the atrium.  A
transesophageal echocardiogram was scheduled, however, the
patient did not tolerate sedation required for the procedure
as she dropped her blood pressure precipitously.  This blood
pressure drop responded to a brief bolus of pressors.  She
had no further hemodynamic instability following the
procedure.  The procedure was aborted and is not being
rescheduled at this time.  It is felt that the mass that was
seen on the TTE is likely within the wall of the atrium
rather than an attached thrombus or myxoma.  This will not e
further pursued dur
