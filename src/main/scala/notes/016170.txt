CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf, eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf, eff
AP CHEST, 9:38 A.M., [**6-25**]

HISTORY: Status post CABG.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-20**]:

Moderate left pleural effusion has increased, and new
obscuration of the left heart border could be due either to that
effusion surrounding the heart or co-existent abnormality in the
lingula, probably collapse. Small right pleural effusion is
unchanged. Right-sided cardiac shadow is unchanged, and
mediastinal vascular engorgement has cleared, but I cannot
comment heart size. No pneumothorax. Right PICC line tip
projects low over the SVC.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT

Reason: R/O DVT SWELLING

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o dvt
HISTORY: 68-year-old male status post CABG.

COMPARISON: Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound of
[**2124-4-25**].

LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler
ultrasound examination of the left common femoral, superficial
femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility,
flow, and augmentation. No intraluminal thrombus is seen. The
patient is status post harvest of greater saphenous vein for
CABG; a small amount of fluid is seen in the soft tissues along
the expected course of the greater saphenous vein. Lymph nodes
measuring up to 1 cm in short axis and demonstrating fatty hila
are noted in both groins.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left
lower extremity.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

 RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2124-6-19**] 11:14 AM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o consolidation vs. pleural effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o consolidation vs. pleural effusion
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

PROCEDURE: CT chest without contrast on [**2124-6-19**].

COMPARISON: Multiple previous chest radiographs and a chest CT
scan examination on [**2124-4-26**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained from the
thoracic inlet to the subdiaphragmatic area without contrast.
Thinner slice 5 mm and 1.25 mm images were reconstructed in the
axial plane at different window algorithms. Sagittal/coronal
reformatted images were also obtained for further evaluation.

HISTORY: 68-year-old man status post CABG procedure on [**5-30**].
Rule out consolidation versus pleural effusion.

FINDINGS:

Lower most three sternal wires are off line to the left, better
seen on the scanogram with sternal dehiscence, which is most
pronounced at the inferior most sternal wire (3:29) and measures
1.6 cm in width. Extending through this wide dehiscence into the
anterior inferior mediastinal compartment is a collection of
high attenuation, which measures 3.5 x 6.5 cm. Postoperative
changes in the mediastinal fat pad anteriorly is seen from a
CABG procedure.

Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Multiple extensively
atherosclerotic coronary vasculature are seen.

The lungs are clear with the exception of the bases where there
is minimal bilateral pleural effusion and adjacent basilar
atelectasis.

There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes according to CT
criteria in the mediastinum or in the hilar area.

The limited evaluation of the abdomen show hyperdense stones or
sludge in the gallbladder. No other abnormality is seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Sternal dehiscence involving the three inferior wires most
pronounced with a 1.6 cm bony separation and a collection
extending from that site into the anterior left mediastinal
compartment suggestive of a potentially inflammated fluid
collection.
2. Small bibasilar atelectasis and effusion are seen. Without a
contrast examination, no pneumonia can be excluded at these
sites; however, the remainder of the lungs are relatively clear.
3. Sludge/stones in the gallbladder, which do not show any signs
of inflammation.
