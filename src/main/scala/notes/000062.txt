Chief Complaint:
retroperitoneal bleed s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 61yoF with hx of bipolar d/o, nephrogenic diabetes
insipidus, hypothyroidism, recently diagnosed RLE peroneal DVT
on warfarin, admitted to the TSICU s/p fall for management of RP
bleed.
The pt was discharged to Rehab from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] on [**2183-10-1**]
after an admission for altered mental status that was ultimately
attributed to lithium toxicity and an untreated UTI, during
which time she was found to have a RLE peroneal DVT and started
on warfarin. On [**10-9**] the pt had a witnessed slip and fall and
was taken to [**Hospital1 **]-N for hypotension where she was found to have
HCT 19. Noncon CT scan revealed a large left RP hematoma and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

In the TSICU the pt was hemodynamically unstable despite volume
resuscitation, was given ultimately 11u prbc and 8u ffp. IR was
consulted and on  [**10-10**] placed an IVC filter and embolized 2
bleeding lumbar arteries after which she stabilized. No further
blood transfusions since [**10-10**]. Hemodynamically stable.

Pt still with some delirium/agitation, though alert and
oriented.

The patient is currently being transferred for management of
diabetes insipidus. Per the team they have been trying to free
water resuscitate but having difficulty following with her large
diuresis (8-10L uop daily). Na has ranged from 138-151
(currently 145).

Currently, patient feels short of breath and palpitations.
States that she has a cough that is productive with yellow
phlegm. Denies hemoptyiss. Denies headache, chest pain (both
pressure and pleuritis) nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
distention, and leg pain.

ROS: per HPI, denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria. Currently passing flatus and gas

Imaging:
CXR:
Interval placement of a right internal jugular catheter with tip

projecting at the expected level of the high superior vena cava.


CXR:
Mild cardiomegaly is accompanied by worsening pulmonary vascular

congestion.  Persistent areas of patchy and linear atelectasis
in the
juxtahilar regions, and in the retrocardiac area.  Likely
layering left
pleural effusion resulting in hazy increased opacity throughout
the left
hemithorax.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No definite aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmo
