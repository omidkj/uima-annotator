Pertinent Results:

Brief Hospital Course:
Prior to going to the Operating Room for the pericardial window
procedure, he was given 2 units of FFP and coumadin(INR-1.8) was
held. His Nitrates and HCTZ were also temporarily held. Mr [**Known lastname **]
was eventually weaned from the ventilator and extubated on
[**2144-6-12**] after a transient episode of tachycardia and O2
desaturation that required lopressor and increase in his O2.
His BP remained stable, his JVD and edema decreased, and a
repeat ECHO on [**2144-6-11**] showed sm. pericardial effusion, RA/[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7151**] dilated, mod-severe TR/MR, severe apical hypokinesis,
mild hypokinesis of rest of LV   After extubation in the CCU, pt
stabilized and was returned to floor. Initially, pt was dyspnic,
but denied pain, N/V/HA/fevers. CT remained in place, and was
removed [**6-15**] by cardiac surgery without complications. Pt
started on ethacrinic acid and HCTZ on [**6-15**] to aid in diuresis
(this regimen is one of the only ones he tolerates due to
multiple drug reactions), with close attention paid to
electrolytes. The right lung showed a pleural effusion, but the
patient elected to attempt to reduce the effusion with diuresis
alone and not to perform thoracentesis. Pt had physical therapy
daily, and improved significantly in the few days after being
returned to the floor. When INR came down to patient's baseline
on [**6-16**], pt was restarted on his home dose of coumadin (2 mg po
qd 5 days of the week, 3 mg 2 days of the week). The patient
stated his MD [**First Name (Titles) 7152**] [**Last Name (Titles) 7153**] his INR at 1.3 to avoid
nosebleeds at higher INRs, but it was explained that a range of
[**1-21**] was required for prevention of stroke in patients with
A-fib.  Pt understood. On the day of discharge to [**Hospital 38**]
Rehabilitation Center, his INR was 3.1, so coumadin was held,
with plan to have daily INR checks until it stabilizes, then
restart in rehab. Pt conitnued to have good O2 saturations well
and was eating. Pt told medical team that his arthritis and back
pain was well controlled with the Tylenol regimen, therefore, pt
was told he should follow up as an outpt by talking to his PCP
and asking him/her to make a referral for pain management if
patient wants to explore pain management further. During
hospital stay, pt had foley catheter, which was removed. Pt's UA
showed microhematuria, asymptomatic, without any complications
in course.  Pt to follow up with PCP (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to see
in interim before re-eatablishing with new geriatrician, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] to repeat UA in [**2-20**] weeks to look for persistent
hematuria, and subsequent w/u of bladder/renal pathology if
positive. Pt to go to rehab, with close follow up with his
electrolytes, BUN/Cr, and INR.
