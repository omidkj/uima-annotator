Brief Hospital Course:
This 56 y/o female presented to the brain tumor clinic after she
had outisde imageing that revealed a suprasellar meningioma.
Her initial complaint was for progressive visual loss over a
three yr period.  Her visual loss was significant for right eye
blindness as well as VF cut to temporal [**Last Name (un) 8491**] in left eye. She
was admitted to the hospital [**2159-5-10**] through the same day
surgery department after informed consent with an interpreter
was obtained.  She underwent the procedure without complication.
 She also had a lumbar drain placed intraopertively for cerebral
decompression for improved access for tumor resection.  This was
clamped postoperatively until the MRI of the Brain was
completed. She remained intubated postoperatively for airway
protection.  Her post operative exam was stable and she was MAE.
 POD#1 pt was transfused one unit PRBC for HCT of 27.8.  She was
started on mannitol, decadron and dilantin immediatley
post-operatively.  POD# 2 her HCT had dropped to 23.0 and she
was transfused 2 additional units of PRBC's. She was started on
Heparin sq as well. The Neuro-oncology service was called to
evaluate the patient postoperatively.  She is known to their
service and at this time they recommmend repeat formal ophtho
eval after d/c. Her lumbar drain was d/c'd on POD#3 as well as
her foley.  She was extubated this day as well.  Her exam
remained stable however her VF testing remains difficult [**3-15**]
periorbital edema and language barrier.  She is MAE with full
strength.  Her HCT is 24.7 this day. Her decadron was tapered 1
mg QD. POD# 4 HCT 27.7.  Dilantin 11.6.  Her incision remains
CDI and is approximating well.

Her evaluation by PT and OT reveals that she is safe to go home
with use of a walker.
Her post hospitalization office visits have been arranged.  Her
husband has concerns that she is not completely pain free in the
scalp area but this is normal for the postoperative phase. This
was explained to him through and interpreter.  He also had
concerns that she was not sleeping well at night and requests a
sedative.  It was explained in detail to the husband with and
interpreter and the son that the pt is NOT to go home and lay on
the couch or in bed.  She has needed a lot of encouragement to
remain mobile during the hospitalization.  Side effect of DVT
and postoperative PNA and the danger associated with them were
also discussed in detail.  The son verbalizes understanding of
this.

Upon d/c on [**2159-5-16**], pt had 1 episode of emesis 100cc, patient
