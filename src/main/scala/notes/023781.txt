CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hematocrit of 16 at [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital **] transferred to Emergency Department.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old male with
past medical history of congestive heart failure with 25%
stroke, discharged [**5-25**] from [**Hospital1 **], had thrombolysis at that
time without any residual neurologic deficits, recovering
getting rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **].  The patient was in his
usual state of health in [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation until about
two days ago when he noticed melena.  At that time, he was
having no abdominal pain, bright red blood per rectum or
hematemesis.
The day of admission, the patient had nausea, vomiting, x1
with black material.  His hematocrit was checked at the
rehabilitation facility and it was 16.  They treated him
there with 3 units packed red blood cells, vitamin K and 1
unit fresh frozen plasma.  He repeated emesis and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department.  On arrival, he had
hematocrit of 19, was treated stat with 2 units and matched
blood.  His blood pressure at the time was 80s/50s, but
responded with red blood cells and normal saline back to
100/60s.  Gastrointestinal evaluated the patient.
Nasogastric lavage of coffee grounds cleared after 1 liter
and then became pinkish red.  His INR was 2.4, so he was
given 4 units fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K and a total
of 3 more units of blood.  Gastrointestinal was to perform
esophagogastroduodenoscopy when INR was less than 1.6.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  He was 95.8??????. pulse 62, blood pressure
86/palpable in the Emergency Department, respiratory rate of
18.  He was a pale elderly male awake and oriented x3,
conversive, good mental status.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Dry oropharynx.  Anicteric
sclerae.  Pale conjunctivae.
NECK:  No jugular venous distention, no LAD.
PULMONARY:  Coarse breath sounds, decreased breath sounds in
the right base.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Irregularly irregular 2+ pulses throughout.
BUTTOCKS:  An about 1 cm linear ulceration, mild.
ABDOMEN:  Good bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, warm, 2+ pulses, pale nail bed.

LABS AND STUDIES:  White count 7.4, H&H 5.8 and 16.9,
platelets 123.  Sodium 145, potassium 4.2, chloride 118,
bicarbonate 18, BUN 67, creatinine 1.1, glucose 127, calcium
7.7 corrected to 9.1 with an albumin of 2.3 and phosphate
4.0, magnesium 1.7.  His PT was 18.6 with an INR of 2.4, PTT
43.6.  Digoxin level obtained, 0.4.  The patient received a
chest x-ray that showed a right middle lobe and right lower
lobe infiltrate.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation, a right bundle branch block and scooping/ST
depression V1 through V4, as well as ST depression V4 through
V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  That evening, esophagogastroduodenoscopy
was performed showing a bleeding vessel that was unable to
localize for treatment.  After procedure, there was a
possible aspiration, so the patient was intubated.  The
patient was rushed to angiography, but a bleeding vessel could
not be identified with certainty.  There was an unsuccessful
attempt to catheterize the celiac trunk vessels.  The bleeding
slowed with correction of coagulopathy.  Total, he got 15 units
of packed red blood cells, 9 units of fresh frozen plasma, one
pack of platelets and fibrinogen remained within normal limits.
Hematocrit remained stable.  [**8-8**], day of discharge,
hematocrit remaining stable at 44.9.

The day after admission, the patient returned to [**Location 213**] sinus
rhythm. The patient, overnight, after become a little more
hypotensive with mean arterial pressures in the 50s, so pressors
were started displaying a MAP of greater than 60.  The next
morning, the vasopressors were discontinued.  The patient
maintained adequate blood pressure.

During the time of the hypotension, blood cultures and sputum
cultures were obtained, then vancomycin and Levaquin were
started empirically.  Blood cultures eventually grew out pan
sensitive Enterococcus and sputum levofloxacin sensitive
Klebsiella, so vancomycin was discontinued and Levaquin was
continued for a 10 day course.

On [**8-2**], troponin was 9, CK 65, CK/MB 7.  On the 19th,
troponin bumped to greater than 50, CK maximum of 923, CK/MB
maximum 156.  This trended down to CK of 499 and CK/MB in the
normal range.  No anticoagulation was started, including aspirin,
secondary to the bleeding, but the patient was monitored.
Cardiology was involved also in regards to his sick sinus
syndrome.  They recommended no temporary pacemakers, as well as
no anticoagulation.  He was extubated on the 20th, did well, no
reintubation was necessary.  Hematocrit remained stable.  The
patient is to be discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation
facility.  Gastrointestinal with plans to repeat the
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in four to six weeks.
