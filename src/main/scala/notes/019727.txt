History of Present Illness:
65 y.o. man with a known history of metastatic melanoma who
comes in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED today with a chief complaint of
headaches and vomiting. Per the patient's wife and son, who are
with him today, he was diagnosed with melanoma 2
years ago when he found a lesion on his right anterior neck. He
then underwent excision and biopsy of this lesion and has
subsequently had chemotherapy x 2 and high-dose IL-2. Since this
time he had undergone regular disease surveilance, and has been
found to have metastatic disease to the lungs and abdomen. Over
the past few months he has been feeling well. However, he has a
been having b/l frontal headaches over the past week, which have
been minimally relieved with OTC pain meds. At 1:30 AM on [**11-2**]
he woke up and vomited 3-4 times and complained of excrutiating
pain in the back of his head and neck. He was then taken to an
OSH for evaluation and found to have an intracranial lesion on
CT. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. His wife
and son
deny any recent behavioral or mental status changes, recent
memory loss, or motor weakness. They do, however, report some
imbalance and unsteady gait. Of note, he had an MRI of the brain
in [**2173-5-27**] that did not show any intracranial masses.

Imaging:
Head CT([**11-2**]):
IMPRESSION:
New 3 cm hyperdense lesion within the right temporoparietal
region highly
consistent with a melanoma metastasis. Mild associated mass
effect as
described.

MRI(Head) [**11-3**]:
MPRESSION:
1. Large relatively acutely hemorrhagic lesion in the posterior
right
temporoparietal region. This has surrounding zone of vasogenic
edema and
slight mass effect with evidence of "trapping" of the temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
ipsilateral lateral ventricle. There is melanin, or perhpas,
more subacute
hemorrhage at the dorsal aspect of the lesion, with only a faint
"blush"
of enhancement, anteriorly. The overall appearance is suggestive
of
hemorrhagic melanoma metastasis.
2. Appearance of at least partial "trapping" of the temporal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
ipsilateral lateral ventricle.
3. No other hemorrhagic or enhancing focus.

CT Torso([**11-3**])
Multiple pulmonary nodules are little changed from [**2173-10-1**] except
for slight
increase in size of posterior right lower lobe nodule.
Pleural-based nodules on the right are decreased in size. No new
focus of metastatic disease is seen. Interval substantial
improvement in paraaortic retroperitoneal fat stranding and soft
tissue density compared to [**2173-10-1**]. Colonic diverticulosis.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 65M who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department
following a period of time feeling ill with heache and vomiting.
He has PMH significant for known metastatic melanoma. Head CT
was performed in the emergency department revealing a right
sided temporal mass.  Given the location of the mass, he was
admitted for observation to the ICU pending further evaluation.
He was subsequently seen by neuroncology who agreed with
neurosurgery to pursue the resection of his mass.  On [**2173-11-4**],
he underwent a right sided craniotomy to resect the mass.  He
was monitored overnight in the ICU. Post-operative head CT
revealed expected post-operative changes.

The patient was transferred to the general floor on POD 1 and
began tolerating a regular diet. His pain was well controlled
initially with IV, and then PO pain medication. His Foley
catheter was removed on POD 1. On POD 1, an MRI was obtained and
showed "resection of right temporal mass with mild residual
enhancement." There was no evidence of acute infarction and
there was a small amount of blood products seen at the surgical
site.

The patient was ambulating, taking in food PO and voiding
without difficutly prior to discharge. He was instructed to
follow-up as necessary with all of the physicians who are caring
for his cancer needs. He was sent home with a steroid taper down
to 2mg [**Hospital1 **]. The patient was oriented x 3, full strength and
sensation throughout. He was stable upon discharge.
