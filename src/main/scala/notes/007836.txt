Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Skull lesion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Resection Left skull lesion and cranioplasty Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2151-9-1**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3708**] is otherwise healthy,64-year-old lady who was
originally diagnosed with renal cell cancer in [**2144**].  She had
metastatic disease in the adrenal gland. She has had resection
following whichshe was on steroid replacements.  She also has
other pulmonary disease.  CT scan in [**2150-5-31**] showed some lung
infiltrates.  She was being on followup and further staging CT
scans were done.  More recently, she had a history of what she
thought was a hit to her head and she noticed some bump and
initially thought to have trauma and skull film was done on [**8-20**], [**2149**], which was followed up by an MRI.  MRI
showed an expansile 4 x 2.2 x 3.0 cm enhancing mass centered in
the diploic space at the left frontal bone marginated by frontal
suture posteriorly with thinning and depression inner table.
The patient was then seen by me for consideration of radiation
after consideration of histologic diagnosis.

The patient herself noticed a bump, some achiness in this area,
but otherwise no other higher function, cranial nerves, sensory,
motor, or neurological dysfunction.


Past Medical History:
Metastatic renal cell cancer status post
radical nephrectomy in [**2144**], adrenal insufficiency and
disposition of the chronic renal disease, however, prior
obesity,
hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypercholesterolemia, and depression.


Social History:
She does not abuse tobacco or alcohol

Family History:
No history of cancer in family

Physical Exam:
Pre-op
She appears comfortable at rest, alert,
and oriented.  Eyes, ears, nostrils, and oropharynx are
unremarkable.  Neck is soft.  No nodes, elevated JVP, or thyroid
swelling.  Chest, bilateral good air entry.  Normal heart
sounds.
 No decreased heart sounds.  Abdomen is soft.  No mass,
tenderness, or hepatosplenomegaly.  Neurological and
musculoskeletal examination is grossly intact.  Examination of
the skull itself reveals circumscribed bump on the scalp from
the
underlying calvaria in the left frontal area

On discharge:
AVSS
AxOx3
NAD
pleasant
symmetric chest rise, breathimg comfortably
sitting up in bed
incision c/d/i w/o induration or erythema
CNII-XII intact
No focal or diffuse neurologic deficits appreciated.

Pertinent Results:
[**9-1**] MRI brain with and without contrast: Enhancing left frontal
skull mass as described corresponding to a lytic lesion in the
skull radiograph in keeping with metastatic disease.  No
intraparenchymal extension of this mass.  No enhancing lesions
within the brain.

[**9-1**] CT head: The patient is post left frontal craniectomy and
resection of a large calvarial-based mass, seen on the
preoperative [**2151-9-1**] MR examination.  There is mild
pneumocephalus (2:12).  A cranial plate overlies the resection
site.  There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema.  No
large hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect is seen.  The middle ear
cavities, mastoid air cells, and included views of the paranasal
sinuses are clear.

[**9-2**] MRI Brain with and without: 1.  Expected post-surgical
appearance of left frontal craniectomy and resection of the left
calvarial mass.
2.  No mass-like enhancement around the surgical cavity.
Persistent left
frontal dural enhancement, also seen in the pre-operative study.

3.  No acute infarcts.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3708**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
resection of left calvarial mass and cranioplasty. She was given
stress dose steroids prior to case for adrenal insufficiency.
During the operative case she lost 2L of blood and received 2
units PRBS. Post-op hct was 37. She had hypokalemia intra-op due
to her adrenal insufficiency but this corrected to 3.1. She was
extubated post-op and was taken to the ICU.  Postoperatively she
remained neurologically intact.  Postop Head CT demonstrated no
hemorrhage.

On [**9-2**], POD1 she was doing well, advanced her diet and was up
and out of bed.  Postoperative MRI was performed and she was
transfered to the regular floor.

On [**9-3**] the patient was noted to be delerious, not oriented to
the month or specific hospital. She was afebrile, urinalysis was
negative for infection and possibly delerium inducing
medications were stopped. BMP did reveal significant
abnormalities including hypokelemia, hypophosphotemia and low
magnesium. A geriatric consult was called and they felt that the
electrolyte abnormalities were most likely responsible for the
delerium. These were repleted and her chlorthalidone was d/c'd .
Overnight the patient was refusing care and IV placement. She
was temporarilly restrained in order to get an IV placed.
On [**9-4**] her exam was much improved. She was alert and oriented
but still slow compared to her baseline. Repeat electrolytes
showed improvement but were still low so they were again
repleted per Geriatrics recommendation. Creatinine was back to
baseline. Also she was started on standing tylenol for pain
control.

On [**9-4**], the patient returned to baseline level of functioning
and electrolytes normalized. Discharge planning to
rehabilitation facility was undertaken.

On [**9-5**], the patient awaited transfer to rehabilitation facility.

On [**9-6**], the patient was discharged in stable condition. The
patient expressed readiness for discharge and was alert and
oriented to person, place, and date. All questions were
answered.
