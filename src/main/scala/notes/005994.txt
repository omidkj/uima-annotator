History of Present Illness:
40 year old man with a history of abdominal pain who presents
with 1 day of beltlike abdominal pain.

The patient presents with nausea/vomiting and abdominal pain.
The abd pain began yesterday morning at dialysis. He developed
nausea and emesis, vomiting small amounts of liquid, non-bloody.
He describes the pain as [**9-19**] in a band-like distribution
across his umbilicus. He also had 2 loose non-bloody BMs. He is
c/o mild HA. The patient reported he took his morning
medications but did not tolerate medications since that time
missing his two PM doses of labetolol.  He denies recent etoh
use, abdominal trauma.  Presentation is typical to past. Onset
of abdominal pain 1 year prior and typically resolve only w/
hospitalizations. BPs at home can be as low as 170s when he
occasionally takes them but in general are high.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.4 74 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 69665**]0% RA.
Physical exam significant for mild tenderness to palpation
across the epigastrum. No rebound/guarding. Positive bowel
sounds. Initial labs demonstrated a normal lipase of 49,
unremarkable chem10 and coags.  Imaging was not pursued given
the patients typical symptoms and being well known to the
emergency staff.  He was given zogran 4mg x 2, dilaud 1mg x 3
and ativan 2mg IV x 1. For management of his hypertension, he
was given IV labetolol 20mg x 2, and a 800mg PO tablet with
blood pressures stbly in the 180-200s.  He was initially
assigned a general medical floor bed, however given concern for
requiring IV anti-hypertensives by the floor team, his
bed-assignment was changed to the MICU.  Vitals on transfer
were: 77 99% RA 16 98.1 199/126.  He was assymptomatic.

On arrival to the MICU,  97.8, 206/129, 96% RA, 15. He is
comfortable and c/o mild HA.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: This is a 40 year old gentleman with a history
of pancreatitis who presented with 1 day of beltlike abdominal
pain.

***MEDICINE COURSE: PATIENT ELOPED FROM FLOOR ON [**5-28**] OVERNIGHT
WITH IV IN PLACE. BED WAS HELD FOR SEVERAL HOURS HOWEVER HE DID
NOT RETURN.***

# Hypertension: ***Note, patient has a long history of
non-compliance*** Longstanding HTN complicated by ESRD.
Assymptomatic and no evidence of end organ damage.  Likely
exacerbated by inability to tolerate PO. Plan to control nausea,
restart home regimen and control HTN w/ prn IV labetolol and IV
hydralazine. Review of prior records reveals BPs during
admissions typically between 170-220s requiring IV control.
Denies active illicit drug use but consider possible ongoing use
including cocaine. He was started on his home regimen in the ICU
and given a 1x dose of hydralazine 10mg with improvement of BPs
to 140-170s.  He was monitored on his home dose of amlodipine
10, lisinopril 40 and labetolol 800 tid for 24 hours. While at
dialysis, patient had SBPs in 180s-210s and was given several
doses of hydralazine with some effect. Patinet was started
nifedipine per renal recommendations. Ulimately plan was to
start hydralazine.

# Nausea/Emesis: Frequent admissions for chronic abdominal pain
attributed to pancreatitis exacerbations.  Lipase normal as has
been in the past.  The patient denies recent etoh use.  No
recent abdominal trauma. Does not appear to have a regular PCP
or GI or significant past w/u for abdominal pain. Prior records
indicate h/o polysubstance abuse as outlined below. He was made
NPO given IV anti-emetics and IV pain medications initially and
was subsequently transitioned to PO medications and solid food.


# Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has polydrug abuse which includes IV
narcotics. He has a history of going to different medical
centers ([**Hospital1 112**], [**Hospital1 2177**], [**Hospital1 3278**]) and complaining of abdominal pain and
nausea in order to receive IV dilaudid. When he is refused IV
meds, he checks out AMA. There is a standing order at the other
three centers' EDs to not give him IV narcotics as there is also
some question of malingering.***

# Multiple Skin Nodules: Likely Kyrle??????s disease, an acquired
perforating dermatosis seen in ESRD vs less likely calcinosis
cutis. Does not appear to be pruritic or bothersome.

# ESRD: Secondary to longstanding hypertension.  The patient
currently receives dialysis on a MWF schedule. He was continued
on calcium acetate and nephrolcaps.
