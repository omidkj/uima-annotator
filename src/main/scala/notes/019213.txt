Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
64 y/o F, with a PMHx significant for oxygen dependent COPD,
diastolic CHF, [**First Name3 (LF) 1291**] (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) on coumadin, s/p MRSA sternotomy
wound infxn, DM2, and a fib, who presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
on [**2130-10-24**] with hypoxia, dyspnea and symtpoms c/w with similar
episodes of CHF. She was initially treated with BiPap, but
failed and therefore required ET-intubation. She also had fevers
with Tmax of 103, hypotension with SBP in 80's treated with
agressive fluid resucitation. On [**10-25**] blood cultures, [**4-23**] were
positive for GPC. Urine Culture + for staph. The bacteria was
further identified as MRSA. She was started on
Vanc/Gatiflox/Flayl and stress dose steroids (solumedrol 125mg
IV TID). It was suspected the patient may have been developing
possible DIC. At this time she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care beginning on [**2130-10-26**]. She did not require any
pressors during her transfer.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname **] presented to an outside hospital with SOB and hypoxia
presumed secondary to CHF. After developing Staph aureus
bacteremia, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of a
possible prosthetic valve endocarditis. Despite a negative
work-up for a source of bacteremia (possibly related to skin
breakdown) including TEE, the patient improved on antibiotics.
Early in her course, she developed left parietal hemorrhage in
the setting of heparin anticoagulation for [**Hospital1 1291**] stroke
prophylaxis. She was left with a right-sided hemiparesis. She
was successfully extubated but then sufferred a PEA arrest on
[**2130-11-11**], the etiology of which is unclear possibly secondary to
a mucous plug vs. hypovolemia. During the arrest the patient was
reintubated. Because of difficulty weaning from the vent, a
tracheostomy was performed on [**2130-11-20**]. On chest x-ray [**11-22**], a
left pleural effusion was noted and tapped for fluid analysis.
The fluid was found to be transudative in nature, with no
infectious organisms. The effusion appears to be as a result of
volume overload, decreasing in size after hemodialysis. The
patient's respiratory status has not been compromised by the
effusion. The patient also developed acute renal failure and is
currently anuric. She is hemodialysis dependent and receives
dialysis MWF. Her left subclavian tunnel catheter was placed on
[**11-24**]. The patient had remained afebrile for multiple days until
[**12-3**] when a temp of 102 was noted. Sputum cultures were
positive for pseudomonas. She is currently being treated with IV
abx including levofloxacin and azetreonam and will complete a 3
week course. At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile.

1) Resp Failure: The pt was intubated and stable upon admission
to [**Hospital1 18**]. Her resp failure was presumed secondary to an acute
CHF exacerbation along with underlying severe obesity,
deconditioning, and COPD. Given her bacteremia, a concern for
sepsis was also put forth with resultant resp failure, but her
hemodynamic state was not concordant with sepsis. Over her
course, her resp status was complicated after a PEA arrest and
reintubation, subsequent tracheostomy, left pleural effusion
(stable) and pseudomonas pneumonia as well as underlying obesity
and deconditioning. At the time of discharge the patient was
doing well on AC with an FiO2 of 0.4, RR of 12, Tv of 650, and
PEEP of 5. Over her course, she was treated with
albuterol/atrovent MDI along with inhaled steroids to target
COPD. To address her CHF, diuresis (with lasix and nesiritide)
was only marginally successful and she was commenced on
hemodialysis which she remains on three times weekly.

2) Staph Aureus Bacteremia: The patient had four of four
positive blood cultures at the OSH for MRSA. Her initial set of
blood cultures (along with her urine culture) at [**Hospital1 18**] were also
positive for MRSA. Vancomycin was commenced for a four week
course (for empiric endocarditis coverage) and subsequent blood
cultures were unremarkable. However, early in her course she had
intermittent fevers. Her previous intravenous lines were
discontinued. After a negative TEE, TTE, culture data (including
previous lines), and panimaging, a source of her MRSA was
unknown. The patient has sacral and subpannus skin break down
diffusely, which was treated with antifungals and topical
powders as outlined in the nursing notes. She was seen by the ID
service who provided recommendations. Wound cultures were
negative for HSV, VZV, syphillis.

3) CHF: Again, the patient was fluid overloaded by central
hemodynamic evaluation along with her exam. However,
echocardiography showed a preserved LVEF. Given her history of
diastolic CHF, she was initially started on Lasix, a Lasix drip,
and then Nesiritide. With little success, she was tried on HD
and then CVVHD for fluid removal. At the time of discharge the
patient is HD dependent.

5) ARF: Upon admission, her Cr was 4.0 from a baseline of
1.5-1.7. The etiology was presumed secondary to CHF and/or mild
sepsis with poor renovascular flow. She had intermittent
oliguria and intermittent adequate urine ouput over her course.
Initially, there was ATN based on urine sediment (with
