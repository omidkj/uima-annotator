Admission Date:  [**2144-3-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2144-3-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2110-8-30**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old
female who was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit
after a Klonopin overdose and was intubated for airway
support.

She has a long history of bipolar disorder and was found
slumped over in a car.  By report, she was initially
unresponsive and cyanotic with a respiratory rate of 10.  She
was found by a family member who is an emergency medical
technician.  She was given oxygen via nasal cannula and
reportedly told the medical staff that she had taken
Klonopin, and an empty Klonopin bottle was found.  The
patient's friend noted that other drugs were missing as well;
which included diabetic and hypertensive medications.  A
suicide note was found as well, and the patient was taken to
the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, her temperature was 99.2 degrees
Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 116/56, and she was
saturating 96% on room air, with a heart rate of 107.  On
examination, she appeared somnolent.  She received Narcan
times one in the Emergency Department without improvement.
There was consideration to give her flumazenil. She was not
given flumazenil for fear it would precipitate seizures with
the chronic benzodiazepines use.  Because of the need for
nasogastric tube placement and activated charcoal, she was
nasally intubated for airway protection.  After she was
intubated, she was given Ativan with an initial drop in her
blood pressure into the 70s to 80s; requiring 15 minutes of
Levophed and intravenous fluid hydration with improvement.
She was subsequently taken off Levophed.  Her chest x-ray
showed no obvious pulmonary abnormalities.  She received a
FAST ultrasound in the Emergency Department which was
unremarkable.  She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive
Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bipolar disorder (times eight years).
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Osteoarthritis.
4.  A questionable history of asthma.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  History of gastric bypass surgery (complicated by a
ventral hernia, and reversal of her bypass, as well as
abdominal wall abscesses, and chronic abdominal pain).
7.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2133**].
8.  History of iron deficiency anemia.
9.  History of amenorrhea and possible polycystic ovary
syndrome.

ALLERGIES:  Unknown at the time of admission, but was
reported as no known drug allergies on previous medical
records.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   (By report, her medications on
admission included)
1.  Paxil 30 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Klonopin 2 mg by mouth.
3.  Seroquel 200 mg by mouth.
4.  Topamax.
5.  Trazodone.
6.  Ambien.
7.  Albuterol as needed.

By report, medications the patient may have ingested (which
were prescribed to a friend of hers) included Glucophage,
glyburide, Lipitor, Wellbutrin, and atenolol.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco use.  No intravenous drug
use.  By report, the patient is homeless but has been living
with friends.  She recently moved from [**State 108**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs on
admission included a temperature of 99.6 degrees Fahrenheit,
her blood pressure was 101/48, her heart rate was 88,
initially on assist control 500 X 20 with an FIO2 of 40% and
a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 with PIPS of 32 and
plateau pressures of 20.  On examination, she was nasally
intubated.  She was comfortable, intubated, and sedated.
Head and neck examination revealed the sclerae were
anicteric.   The mucosa were moist.  Jugular venous
distention was difficult to assess secondary to obesity.  The
lungs were clear anteriorly and laterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen
was notable for positive bowel sounds.  There was a ventral
hernia.  The abdomen was nondistended.  The extremities had
trace edema bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION: Initial
laboratories were notable for a white blood cell count of
5.8, her hematocrit was 43.3, and her platelets were 207.
Coagulations were normal.  Initial Chemistry-7 revealed her
sodium was 143, potassium was 4.1, chloride was 109,
bicarbonate was 20, blood urea nitrogen was 10, creatinine
was 0.7, and her blood glucose was 95.   Her calcium,
magnesium, and phosphate were within normal limits.  Normal
anion gap.  Initial urinalysis with positive nitrites, 3 to 5
white blood cells, and many bacteria.  There were no
epithelial cells.  Her lithium level was 0.2.  Initial urine
toxicology screen was negative.  Her liver function tests
were within normal limits.  Urine pregnancy test was
negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Initial head computed
tomography revealed no intracranial hemorrhage.  No
fractures.  Suboccluded ethmoid sinuses likely secondary to
nasogastric intubation.

An electrocardiogram with nonspecific ST changes, but no Q-T
prolongation.

A chest x-ray was without acute cardiopulmonary
abnormalities.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient was initially intubated
for airway protection prior to nasogastric tube placement and
activated charcoal for a likely overdose.  After the charcoal
was given, and the effects of the benzodiazepines had worn
off, she was slowly weaned off the ventilator and extubated
on [**3-13**].

After her extubation, she continued to have respiratory
distress with an increased respiratory rate and increased A-A
gradient.  She continued to have respiratory distress with an
increased respiratory rate and increased A-A gradient on
arterial blood gas.  Because of this, she was reintubated.
During her reintubation she had episodes of vomiting and was
thought to have possible aspiration pneumonia.  A right
internal jugular central line was placed, and an arterial
line was placed for close monitoring of her central venous
pressure and blood pressure.

During her hospital course, she had some difficulty weaning
because of elevated transpleural pressures given her obesity.
Her positive end-expiratory pressures were increased
accordingly because of these elevated transportal pressures.

A Big Boy bed was obtained which would allow the patient to
sit more upright so she would have decreased pressure from
the abdomen affecting her respiratory ability.

Her sedation was weaned down, and she had good respiratory
rates and had done well on a breathing trial.  On [**3-18**],
she was extubated and slowly weaned off oxygen to nasal
cannula.  It was felt that she likely had baseline oxygen
saturations in the low 90s and was weaned down accordingly.
She was continued on nighttime [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway
pressure as done previously.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient likely had an
aspiration pneumonia during her reintubation.  Bronchial
washings obtained were notable for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, and she was treated empirically for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and/or aspiration
pneumonia with vancomycin and Flagyl; to complete a 10-day
course.  She had [**12-30**] positive blood cultures which grew
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and were thought to likely
be contaminant.

She had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed prior to the
speciation of her blood cultures which was negative for
vegetations and showed a normal ejection fraction.

Subsequently, her internal jugular line and arterial line
were pulled.  She remained afebrile.

3.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of
gastric bypass surgery with numerous complications including
a ventral hernia and chronic abdominal pain.  Records were
obtained for [**Hospital6 1129**] where she had her
previous surgeries.

On the day of her reintubation, she was noted to have
significantly increased abdominal distention and there was
concern for a small-bowel obstruction given her history of
surgeries and likely adhesions.  The Surgery Service was
consulted.  The orogastric tube was placed to suction
