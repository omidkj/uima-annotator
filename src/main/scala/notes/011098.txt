Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 22204**] is a 66-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 7.6
in [**8-7**], complicated by neuropathy, retinopathy, and severe
Charcot foot deformities), peripheral vascular disease status
post right popliteal-->DP bypass from [**6-6**], two-vessel coronary
disease status post inferior STEMI with bare metal stent placed
to RCA, who was initially transfered to the cardiac ICU
intubated, on pressors, with balloon pump in place. She was
eventually able to be weaned off the balloon pump and
ventilator, however she showed worsening respiratory status
shortly thereafter with increasing oxygen demand and increased
work of breathing.  On day 6 of her admission, she developed a
spontaneous pneumothorax which made postive pressure ventilation
difficult without re-intubation.  On day 7 of her admission, her
CXR showed widespread bilateral airspace opacities which were
worse on the left side than previous images.  Family meeting was
held to discuss the patient's worsening resp status and she was
changed to DNR/DNI status by her HCP.  [**Name (NI) **] PCP was notified as
well.  On the evening of day 7, she desated to the 80s and
became hemodynamically unstable.  Her family was called and pt
passed at 1049pm with brother & sister at bedside.
