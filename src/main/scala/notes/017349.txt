Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted for elevated BUN/Cr

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
76 F with PMH HTN, CAD, DM, dementia (baseline A&Ox3 with
expressive aphasia [**1-31**] to L MCA CVA), [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] [**Male First Name (un) 1291**], CHF, presents
for elevated BUN/Cr and assessment for need for emergent
dialysis. Pt had enterobacter and pseudomonas pneumonia at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Pseudomonas was only susceptible to
aminoglycosides, so pt was started on gentamicin and cefepime on
[**4-5**].  Her Cr started to rise, so gent was d/ced [**4-12**]. After gent
was d/ced, pt was maintained on cefepime, but BUN and Cr
continued to rise. On [**4-16**], labs from [**Hospital **] Rehab showed her Cr
was 3.7 and BUN was 180. Pt's baseline Cr 1.5, baseline BUN
30-50. She arrived from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on Cefepime, that was
started on [**4-12**]?.
.
Pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2182-2-1**], and had been in
ARF at that time. Cr had elevated from baseline 1.5 to 1.9.
Etiology was attributed to being dehydrated on chronic DM, HTN.
Renal was consulted at the time, and recommended weeklong course
of CVVH, but no longterm hemodialysis, because of the grim
prognosis for the patient at the time. She was discharged at
that time on Lasix and metolazone for continued diuresis. She
was admitted to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab in acute on CRF, with Cr of 2.0 on
admission. Etiology was attributed to sepsis, hypotension with
low renal perfusion, CHF exacerbation. At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, pt
underwent weeklong course of HD.
.
Pt had a foley placed at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, but she had a UTI, and it
was kept out. She was apparently incontinent and produced a good
volume of urine per day (she was never anuric). Baseline BP has
been 100-110. Pt was transferred on vent (IMV RR 9 with PS 18)
and HD stable. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for dialysis
catheter placement and to be assessed for need for emergent
dialysis for elevated BUN and Cr.

involved in her care.


Family History:
h/o of PE x2 in son, no history of seizures, but son with heart

Physical Exam:
96.8 / 90 (90-112) / 129/72 / 17 / 100% on trach on vent
Trach on vent: AC 500 / 12+6 / 5.0 / 1.0 FiO2
General: Obese, responsive to voice, staring at ceiling
HEENT: Anicteric, MMM without lesions
Neck: JVD to 8 cm, no LAD, no carotid bruits
CV: Irregularly irregular, clicking sound
Resp: Rales bilaterally
Abd: +BS Soft/NT/ND
Ext: 2+ edema
Skin: No rashes, petechiae
Neuro: Responsive to voice


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**4-17**]:
1. Mild edema.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Nodular opacity seen next to left mediastinum, likely
representing vessels, although dedicated PA and lateral chest
radiograph following treatment is recommended to document
resolution.
.
CT chest [**4-9**]:
IMPRESSION: 1) Worsening bibasilar pneumonia and bilateral
moderate pleural effusions, right greater than left. 2) Multiple
lytic areas in the mid and lower thoracic spine without an
adjacent mass. These can represent osteopenia. However, a bone
scan can be helpful to exclude the presence of bony metastases.
.
EKG [**4-17**]:
Atrial fibrillation.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 F with PMH DM2, HTN, dementia (baseline A&Ox3 with expressive
aphasia [**1-31**] to L MCA CVA), [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] [**Male First Name (un) 1291**], CHF, with renal failure
improving on HD and pneumonia.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
The patient has been chronically vented due to an unknown
etiology. CXR shows moderate bilateral pleural effusions, which
are likely due to pulmonary edema from renal failure. She is
trached on the same vent settings as on admission. Her pleural
effusions were not tapped because the patient was clinically
doing so well and did not have any signs of sepsis. She was
afebrile, with no leukocytosis, was not tachycardic, and was
normotensive throughout admission.
.
# Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, B. cepacia pna:
Followup of the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab sputum cultures showed
Enterobacter, pseudomonas, and B. cepacia in cultures. Patient
developed ATN due to gentamicin, so she was kept on Cefepime for
a total 14 day course. Her sputum culture here only shows 3+ GNR
in the gram stain, and the culture is still pending. [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab physicians will need to follow up on blood cultures,
sputum cultures, and urine cultures from [**Hospital1 18**], to make sure
that the patient's cefepime 14 day course is sufficient, and to
make sure that no new antibiotics need to be started.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:
The etiology of the patient's acute renal failure is likely
acute tubular necrosis from gentamicin-induced nephropathy. Many
muddy brown casts were found in urine sediment. CK was 31 (to
assess for rhabdomyolysis). Pt's chronic renal failure is likely
due to DM and HTN. Pt had a tunneled LSC dialysis cath placed on
[**4-17**], and she received HD x2, once on [**4-18**], once on [**4-19**]. Renal
US was performed, but because of the patient's habitus, the
kidneys could not be visualized bilaterally. The patient's
baseline BUN is 30-50, baseline Cr 1.5.
.
# Altered mental status:
Pt can track her eyes appropriately, but she cannot communicate
or indicate whether she is having pain. During admission, it was
difficult to assess how different her MS is from her baseline
aphasia and dementia. The likely etiology of her altered mental
status is her baseline dementia. Her uremia does not appear to
be severe enough to be causing encephalopathy. Her mental status
did not change appreciably with hemodialysis.
.
# UTI:
Urine culture shows 1+ gram positive bacteria, likely
alpha-streptococcus or lactobacillus. The 14 day course of
Cefepime should cover her UTI. The pt has a history of VRE UTIs,
so this urine culture will need to be followed up for
characterization and sensitivities, and to make sure that no
further organisms appear in the culture.
.
# AFIB with intermittent RVR and St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**]:
Patient is currently on no rate control, no rhythm c
