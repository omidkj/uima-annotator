Chief Complaint:
transferred for further care of hypoxic respiratory failure

endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year-old male, recent ex-smoker, with a
history of ALL Ph chromosome positive on Gleevec status post
allo MUD BMT in [**11/2130**] with subsequent complete remission, also
with a history of COPD and probable CAD, being transferred from
[**Hospital3 5365**] for further management of above issues.
*
He presented to [**Hospital1 392**] on [**8-5**] with a 4-day history of fever up
to 102 at home, chills and shortness of breath. Per records, He
denied increased cough, but endorsed increased wheezing, and
reported right-sided pleuritic chest pain, mostly posterior. +
Orthopnea, no PND, no lower extremity swelling. On the night of
admission, he was reportedly found by his wife in the bathtub,
confused with possible slurred speech. He was brought by EMS to
[**Hospital1 392**].
*
At [**Hospital1 392**], initial vitals with BP 109/69, HR 133, RR 22, Sat 93%
on RA, up to 97% on 2L NC. Temperature not recorded. Labs were
remarkable for WBC 17.5 with bands 11%, neutrophils 82%, hct 36,
plt 109K. Sodium 131, creatinine 2.2. CK 1502, MB 4.12, troponin
0.33. ABG 7.44/28/64 on supplemental oxygen. CXR with probable
RLL pneumonia, and questionable effusion. He was started on CTX
and Azithromycin IV. While in the ED, he developed SVT with HR
to 190s, and was given Adenosine 6 mg IV X1, and Diltiazem IV
bolus with subsequent return to NSR in 90s. He was subsequently
placed on Diltiazem drip 5mg/hour. He later became hypotensive
with SBP to 70s systolic, drip was stopped, and he was given IVF
boluses. His antibiotic coverage was broadened with Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin and Flagyl. His blood pressure responded to the low
100s. A CT head without contrast was also obtained in the ED,
initially read as normal but an addendum made note of "acute to
subacute left upper anterior corona radiata hypodensity with
compression of the left lateral ventricle". He was started on
Heparin IV, and plan was made to proceed with a head MRI, which
was deferred pending rule out of a metallic foreign body. In
addition to he above, subsequent labs showed drop in platelets
to 71 and hematocrit to 26, INR 1.7, cardiac enzymes trending
down. He was transferred for further care.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 54 year-old male with AML in
remission status post allo-BMT, COPD on chronic prednisone
therapy, and probable CAD, who presented with hypoxemic
respiratory failure.
.
1) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient developed hypoxic
respiratory failure thought secondary to severe pneumonia with
exacerbation of COPD.  At [**Hospital3 5365**] he was found to have a
RLL pneumonia.  He was started on ceftriaxone and azitrhomycin
for community acquired pneumonia and steroids for COPD
exacerbation.  After he developed hypotension, his antibiotics
were broadened to levofloxacin/metronidazole/vancomycin.  These
antibiotics were continued at the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
After the legionella urine antigen resulted positive, his
antbiotics were tailored appropriately.  Following transfer, he
did develop respiratory distress and was intubated. His chest
xray was concerning for cavitary lesion so sputum culture and
AFB samples were sent; these were negative.  He underwent a
bronchoscopy while intubated that revealed normal airways. He
was successfully extubated after his agitation on the vent was
managed. Upon transfer to the BMT unit, his RR was 20 and O2
