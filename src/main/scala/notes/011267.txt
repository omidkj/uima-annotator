Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**]
Chief Complaint:
Patient admitted from outside hospital with possible small bowel
obstruction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Status Post bilateral femoral hernia repair.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is nearly [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman who presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] on [**2188-6-6**]
apparently with respiratory symptoms and pneumonia.  She was
noted the following day to have abdominal distention and emesis.

She underwent a CAT scan, which demonstrated a small-bowel
obstruction.  A surgical consultation was obtained and they
elected to treat nonoperatively due to her age and comorbidity.
The thought was that she was at very high risk for complications
and that her outcome would at best entail a difficult and
prolonged recovery.  There was evidently a recommendation that
she be transferred to hospice.  Per the family's wishes, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
potential
surgical treatment.

1. High-grade small-bowel obstruction, with likely transition
point in small
right inguinal hernia.

2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, and adjacent atelectasis.

3. Small volume of ascites.

4. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of cholecystitis.

5. Progression of compression deformity of T11 vertebral body.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent an Exploratory laparotomy, Lysis of adhesions
and Preperitoneal and bilateral femoral hernias with prosthetic
mesh. She tolerated the procedure very well. Immediately
postoperatively she was transferred to the surgical ICU for
monitoring. She had low urine output for the first couple of
days and was given blood as well as fluids. Her urine output
responded well. She also developed fever. Chest x-ray confirmed
atelectasis and she was encouraged to cough and deep breathe and
she was gotten out of bed daily. Patient complained of nausea
that resolved after several days. She was incontinent of stool
and several specimens were sent to lab to rule out c. diff. She
was progressed from a clear liquid diet to ground diet with
prethickened liquids after she was evaluated by speech and
swallow. It was determined that she is at risk for aspiration
and would not tolerate thin liquids and needs supervision with
eating. Despite encouragement from family and staff the patient
did not eat or drink very much. Family confirmed that this was
consistent with her preoperative state. Staff discussed with
family options regarding feeding of patient. Options discussed
were feeding tube and intravenous hydration. Family and patient
have decided to defer these options at this time. She will be
discharged back to her nursing home with hopes to rehabilitate
to previous level as tolerated and per patient and family
wishes.
