Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
47 yo male with hx of diastolic CHF, HTN, DM, and severe sleep
disordered breathing w chronic hypoxia on BiPAP presents from
his rehab facility for hypoxia. He reports increasing shortness
of breath and DOE for the past 3-4 days.  He was found to be
hypoxic to the 60s at his rehab facility so EMS was called and
he was placed on a NRB with sats at 92% on 10L in the field.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6 92 109/55 22 94% 10L NRB. On
exam he had poor air movement, mild exp wheezes right base,
sounded "tight". He was given an albuterol/ipratropium neb and
put on BiPAP with sats then 93%, dipping to high 80s on NRB.
Labs were notable for mildly elevated proBNP, pH 7.3 and pCO2 85
on ABG, mildly elevated lactate of 2.2.  CXR shows little change
from prior xrays, no evidence of infiltrates. He was given lasix
80mg IV but only put out 230cc urine while in the ED.  He was
then transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and worsening
respiratory status.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is on BiPAP but is otherwise in no
distress.  He is able to speak in full sentences through the
mask and give the HPI.  He denies fevers, chills, or cough, but
does say he has been bringing up clear phlegm.  Reports
intermittent compliance with his BiPAP-- he is always using it
at night but not always during daytime naps.  Thinks his asthma
may be flaring a bit from the pollen, but was otherwise feeling
well.  Has been compliant with medications, has not noticed
significant swelling, but he admits some dietary indiscretions
and thinks his weight is up a little.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or
weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria,
frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies
rashes or skin changes.

5. Asthma
6. HTN
7. DM type 2, diet controlled
8. Erythrocythosis, thought secondary to hypoxia

Microbiology:

Blood cultures: pending at time of [**Month/Day/Year **] (currently no
growth to date)

Imaging:

CXR: IMPRESSION: Overall little interval change with no definite
acute pulmonary process noted. In particular, there is no focal
consolidation to suggest pneumonia or significant pulmonary
edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 year old man with diastolic congestive heart failure,
hypertension, pre-diabetes, obesity hypoventilation syndrome and
severe obstructive sleep apnea, presented from his skilled
nursing facility for hypoxia.  CXR showed no significant
interval change from prior films, and there was no radiographic
or clinical evidence of worsening pulmonary edema (note BNP was
1184 which is improved prior levels) or pneumonia.  His hypoxia
appears to be at baseline, and there was no clear evidence of an
acute exacerbating process.  ABG showed 7.3/76/76/47 which is
consistent with chronic respiratory acidosis with appropriate
metabolic compensation.  He was given albuterol and ipratropium
nebulizer treatments for possible bronchospasm (he may have
underlying obstructive component, possibly asthma, although
recent pulmonary function tests would be needed to confirm
this), 80mg IV lasix, and was placed on his home Bipap settings
overnight. He reported improvement in his shortness of breath on
the day of [**Month/Day/Year **] and was at baseline for his oxygen
requirements and saturations.  We discussed placement of a
tracheostomy tube as a means of a more effective therapy for his
severe hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea, however, the
patient declined.  Upon [**Month/Day/Year **], his goal oxygen saturation is
greater than 80% on oxygen supplementation.  Please consider
re-hospitalization if oxygen saturations fall below 80%.

Of note, he had mild acute renal injury with elevated creatinine
1.3 upon admission, which was attributed to pre-renal azotemia
(supported by FeUrea 32%).  His renal function normalized on the
day of [**Month/Day/Year **] to 0.9.  Initially lactate was elevated at 2.0,
but this normalized on the day of [**Month/Day/Year **] as well.

The patient was full code for this admission.
