Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 67436**] is a 71M with endstage COPD s/p trach who was
transferred from [**Hospital **] Rehab with likely aspiration PNA and
sepsis. He arrived to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in a very tenuous condition while
on 2 pressors. He was noted to be in hypoxic and hypercarbic
respiratory failure (hypoxic and hypercarbic), likely secondary
to endstage COPD coupled with aspiration pneumonia. He was
initially ventilated on AC mode via his trach. He was also noted
to be in septic shock and was significantly hypotensive (60/30s)
on 2 pressors on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was started on IVF, stress
dose steroids, and a 3 pressor regimen with Dopamine, Levophed
and Vasopressin. His blood pressure stabilized on this regimen.
.
He was broadly covered with Vanc, Ceftazidime and Clindamycin at
the rehab. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was transitioned to Zosyn, Levoflox
and Vanc. and maintained on a sepsis protocol. He was given
Albuterol MDI, Atrovent MDI and Flovent for COPD exacerbation.
His sputum cultures were significant for Ecoli (S to Zosyn) and
P. aeruginosa. His Levoflox and Vanc were discontinued.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 67436**] has a gradual improvement in his ventilation status
status during the hospitalization. He was noted to have an
APACHE score of >25 for which he was started on 96h of Xigris.
His sedation was eventually weaned off and his blood gases
improved.  His blood pressure remained stable off of pressors.
He did become hypernatremic with a sodium which peaked at 150.
This resolved with the addition of free water boluses to his
tube feedings.
.
Transitioned to PS vent. Pressors weaned off o/n b/w [**5-24**]- [**5-25**].
Had a trach mask trial on [**5-25**], which he failed.  He was noted to
be sig vol overloaded but he started autodiuresing as his vent
settings were weaned down.  His respiratory status improved and
he tolerated longer and longer periods on the trach mask.  His
antibiotics were converted to Zosyn 4.5g IV q8 once his blood
and sputum cultures grew sensitive E.Coli.  Due to his
bacteremia, he was to continue a course of 14 days for his
aspiration PNA with E.coli bacteremia (day#11 on discharge -
last dose [**2185-6-2**]).  Prior to discharge, patient was able to
complete wean from the vent and remained on a 50% trach mask.
.
Patient was transferred to his prior rehab hospital to continue
with trach management as well as to complete a 2 week course of
ABx.  Pt is to remain on tube feedings as he represents a
permanent swallow risk as evaluated by S&S.
