EKG: [**2191-7-8**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2188-2-9**] atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response has appeared. STE
in V2, V3, aVf, V3-6 with STD in V1-2.
.
Imaging:
CXR ([**2191-7-7**])
No definite evidence of consolidation. However, examination of
the left lower lung fields is limited secondary to overlying
hiatal hernia.
.
CXR ([**2191-7-12**]):
The right PICC line tip is in the inferior portion of superior
vena cava. The whole left hemithorax is opacified with a
leftward mediastinal shift due to complete or near-complete
atelectasis of the left lung. The previously demonstrated hiatal
hernia is again noted.
.
CXR ([**2191-7-13**]):
Left lung has reexpanded, though the base is chronically
elevated by a large diaphragmatic hernia containing stomach and
intestine. Persistent atelectasis of the right lower lobe and
small bilateral pleural effusion has increased. Cardiac
silhouette is largely obscured. Mediastinal venous engorgement
suggests volume overload or at least elevated right heart
pressure. There is no free subdiaphragmatic gas. Tip of the
right subclavian catheter projects over the superior cavoatrial
junction. No pneumothorax.
.
CXR ([**2191-7-14**])
New collapse of left upper lung. This may be due to mucus
plugging , atelactasis or endobronchial lesion. Bronchoscopy
would be helpful to evaluate cause of intermittent obstruction
of left mainstem bronchus.
.
CXR ([**2191-7-15**])
Re-expansion of left upper lobe. Worsening of mild-to-moderate
right lower lobe atelectasis and effusion. Stable, chronic
elevation, left hemidiaphragm and small, left pleural effusion.
.
Echocardiogram ([**2191-7-7**]): The left atrium is dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is small. LV systolic function appears depressed
secondary to extensive apical akinesis. However, the basal and
midventricular segments are markedly hyperdynamic, resulting in
a moderate resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever. A
mid-cavitary gradient is also identified. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall of the right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present; the
increased flow velocity across the aortic valve is due to
preacceleration in the left ventricular outflow tract. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is systolic
anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Echocardiogram ([**2191-7-12**]):
Conclusions:
Focused study. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal.  There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis  of the distal [**12-14**] of the left
ventricle, and akinesis of the true apex. No left ventricular
thrombus is seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2191-7-7**], there has been some improvement in the
contractility of the distal [**12-14**] of the left ventricle,however
the rest of the walls are no longer hyperkinetic. Pulmonary
arterial pressure is similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 y/o female with h/o HTN and no prior h/o CAD presents with
vomiting/loose stools and found to have STEMI and guaiac
positive stools. The following issues were addressed during this
hospitalization.
.
1. Cardiac
- Ischemia
The patient presented with a STEMI with STE in inferior and
septal leads. She was found to have positive cardiac enzymes.
Due to GI bleed and patient's functional status, conservative
management of her STEMI ensued with aspirin 81 mg daily and
clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily.
.
- Pump
The patient was found to have an EF of 50% by echocardiography.
The patient's initial echo on dopamine gtt revealed extensive
apical akinesis; the basal and midventricular segments were
markedly hyperdynamic, resulting in a moderate resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Dopamine gtt was
discontinued within the first few hours in the CCU with
subsequent decrease in HR and increased in BP due to improved
diastolic filling. Patient had CHF secondary to diastolic
dysfunction and was successfully diuresed with IV Lasix. Repeat
echo revealed some improvement in the contractility of the
dista
