Pertinent Results:
[**8-16**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed two vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA had mild-moderate plaquing that tapered to a distal 40%
stenosis; the LMCA was also heavily calcified. The heavily
calcified LAD had an ostial 20% stenosis, and a mid 70% stenosis
at a branching D1. There was a more distal 50% stenosis in the
mid LAD and diffuse plaquing throughout the LAD. There were
septal and apical collaterals to RPDA and RPL. The LCx had mild
diffuse plaquing throughout with an ostial LCX ulcer. The AV
groove CX vessel supplied a long OM2, a long OM3, and several
small distal LPL's. The RCA had a 70% ostial lesion with
pressure dampening when engaged, as well as a mid total
occlusion with scant distal filling via vasa collaterals. 2.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an LVEDP of 23 and a
systemic arterial pressure of 183/57 mm Hg. 3. Left
ventriculography was deferred.
[**8-17**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. After
bypass grafting, there were no significant changes in the
echocardiographic findings. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the operating room at the time of the
study.

Provisional Findings Impression: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 24671**] [**Name2 (NI) **] [**2146-8-18**] 11:21 AM
No pneumothorax or sizeable pleural effusion, right IJ catheter
tip in the
superior SVC.


Final Report
REASON FOR EXAM: Assess for pneumothorax, patient post-CABG,
chest tube
removed, and changed dual-lumen right IJ.

There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusions. Right
IJ catheter
tip is in the SVC. Slight increase in left lower lobe
atelectasis. There are
low lung volumes. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
Mediastinal
wires are aligned. There is no pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Right IJ catheter tip can be
followed until the
superior SVC but the distal tip could be in the lower SVC, is
not clearly
visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.7, HR 103, RR 18, BP 131/46.
EKG showed ST depressions and TWI laterally. She received 2SL
NTG which resolved with resolution of pain. She was started on
heparin gtt. Initial BG 676. Received 8U Insulin SC. Initial
lytes showed gap of 17. + Ketones in urine. Pt evaluated by
cardiology in ED. Reported nausea, no vomiting. Pt felt like she
was going into DKA. Pt also noted thirst. Received additional
10U insulin in ED. Repeat AG 13. n arrival to the medical floor
the pt was resting comfortably. She initially denied chest pain
or shortness of breath. No nausea. The pt stated she had
previously refused a cardiac cath and continues to think that
she would only want to undergo a cath in the event of a life
threatening emergency. She has had an insulin pump for the past
1 [**1-26**] yrs and only other episode of possible DKA was during her
previous hospitalization for NSTEMI. She was started on Lovenox
as the patient did not want to have q6hour lab draws for PTT
monitoring.  Throughout the morning, her finger sticks went from
313 down to 152. Her next lab draw showed a BG of 462 and gap of
19. On the floor, she gave herself 4 units of insulin via her
pump, supplemented by an additional 4 units
