Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, 3vd

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PCI with stenting of LAD


History of Present Illness:
60 yo M with h/o ESRD, IDDM, CAD, CHF (EF 15-20%), CVA ([**6-16**]),
ANS dysfxn admitted to OSH with syncope [**Date range (1) 73815**]. 1st episodes
of syncope occurred a week prior after an extra HD session with
6L fluid removed, although pt denies preceding symptoms. He had
several more episodes of syncope and traumatic falls resulting
in hitting his head on the driveway, and losing consciousness
for a few minutes. According to wife, associated with upper
extremity shaking and eyes rolling up in the head, lasting a few
minutes. No urine or stool incontinence, no post-ictal states.
Pt denies associated CP, SOB.
CT of head on admission showed no acute event, + for marked
microvascular disease. He was noted to have elevated troponins,
flat and thought to be [**3-14**] renal failure, CK's flat. As part of
syncope w/u he underwent cardiac cath which revealed 3VD. During
the procedure, pt developed R extremity weakness and dysarthria,
MRI demonstrated multiple small cerebral and cerebeallar emboli
without hemorrhage. He was started on heparin. The patient
continued to experience several episodes of unresponsiveness
with temporary worsening of his R sided weakness. At least one
was during dialysis, ? related to relatively low BP. Repeat MRI
performed on [**7-17**], heparin stopped, and placed on ASA 650mg
daily. MRI repeated [**7-22**] with progression of infarct in L
frontal lobe. Unable to find cause of his multiple emboli,
work-up for vasculitis and hypercoagulable states recommended as
outpatient.
Pt discharged to rehab for 5 days, doing well with ambulation,
no episodes of syncope.
Pt went home in the afternoon of [**7-29**] feeling fatigued, mildly
disoriented. That night pt with PND while sleeping with one
pillow on flat bed (had been in semi-upright bed in hospital).
Dyspnea did not resolve and he presented to OSH (Lakes Regional)
on [**7-30**] with increased SOB. Afebrile, BP 162/82, HR 104, RR 22,
O2 94% on RA, 100% on 3L NC. Pt started on nitro paste,
transferred here for further care of CAD.

[**7-31**]: Carotids: 1. 60%-69% stenosis of the right internal
carotid artery.
2. Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
.
[**7-31**]: CXR no evidence of failure
.
[**7-31**]: ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis, and distal septal/apical
hypokinesis, consistent with multivessel coronary artery
disease. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild)
LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with moderate to severe
regional systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

[**8-2**] MRI/A:
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI: IMPRESSION: Foci of hyperintense signal
within left centrum semiovale and in the anterior portion of the
right centrum semiovale on diffusion images with corresponding
T2 and FLAIR abnormalities. In absence of ADC map, it could not
be confirmed whether these are due to acute infarcts or due to
T2 shine through. Repeat diffusion study with ADC map would help
for further assessment if clinically indicated. No mass effect
or hydrocephalus seen.
MRA OF THE NECK: IMPRESSION: Right internal carotid artery
demonstrates signal loss and narrowing of the flow signal
suggestive of high-grade stenosis. However, the examination is
somewhat limited by motion. Gadolinium-enhanced MRA or CTA would
help for further assessment of the stenosis if clinically
indicated.
MRA OF THE HEAD:IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
