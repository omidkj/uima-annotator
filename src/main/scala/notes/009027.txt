Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 21193**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsiveness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
extubation [**2136-5-26**]
Right IJ placed [**2136-5-26**]

History of Present Illness:
46-year-old male with cervical spinal injury c/b quadriplegia,
indwelling suprapubic catheter c/b recurrent UTIs, baclofen
pump, COPD, OSA who presented to an outside hospital after
seizure like activity followed by prolonged unresponsiveness.

Of note, he was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2136-5-22**]) after a
similar presentation. At that time he had hypotension,
bradycardia, altered mental status which was thought to be
secondary to urinary tract infection and medication effect. He
had negative EEG at that time. He improved with treatment of UTI
and decrease in methadone and diltiazem doses.

On [**2136-5-24**], per the wife and OSH records, the patient had a
seizure that lasted "quiet some time" followed by a period of
prolonged unresponsiveness. He presented to an OSH and with
altered mental status. He had a VBG of 7.22/94/21. It was deemed
that he was in hypercarbic respiratory failure and intubated.
Repeat ABG showed 7.46/50/105. An IO was placed and he recieved
1L IVF and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Labs at OSH showed Lactate
of 2.6.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], vitals were: T 97.6, HR 55, BP 96/61, RR
18, SvO2 97% on vent. Vent settings were: AC TV 490, RR 15, PEEP
5, FiO2 100%. He was "comfortably sedated" with propofol. He had
a right IJ TLC placed. He was given another 2L IVF. He was given
IV vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam. Head CT, CTAP, CXR were
done. CT head negative for acute pathology. CTAP without acute
findings with bibasilar atelectasis. CXR without consolidation.
He was sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further evaluation and management.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient deeply sedated, intubated.

Review of systems: Unable to obtain from patient.

Brief Hospital Course:
46-year-old male with quadraplegia, suprapubic catheter with
recurrent UTIs on ciprofloxacin, multiple sedating [**Year/Month/Day 4982**]
including methadone and valium presents with altered mental
status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

ICU Course:

Neuro:
1) Altered mental status: Appears consistent with toxic
metabolic encephalopathy. It is unclear if this is post-ictal,
infection with delirium, hypercapnea or medication effect. At
this point it is difficult to assess given level of sedation. No
active sign of seizure although he is on a number of [**Year/Month/Day 4982**]
that would lower seizure threshold.
- neuro consult was obtained on [**2136-5-26**] and was started on LTM
which revealed generalized spike wave as well as left hemisphere
discharges and he had an event with right gaze deviation and
body stiffening, unresponsiveness. Due to these findings he was
loaded with Keppra and his home Valium and Gabapentin were
restarted, although at lower doses. Other home [**Date Range 4982**] that
can lead to sedation were held including methadone. After being
loaded with Keppra and he was clically stable he was transferred
to the floor under the neurology service. While on the floor, he
did not have any further episodes of seizures. His EEG did show
"a few detections of paroxysmal potential epileptiform
transients. This activity was seen in a generalized distribution
but also a distribution that favored the left central region",
over the next two days after Keppra was started, his EEG did
show some improvement and he clinically improved so his leads
were taken off on [**2136-5-28**]. He will be discharged home on Keppra
500mg [**Hospital1 **]. He also had an MRI on [**2136-5-29**] to look for an
underlying seizure focus. A final read is currently pending.

Pain: Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a baclofen pump in place and due to his
MRI, the pain service was consulted. The pump was interrogated
before and after the MRI to ensure proper settings and
functioning. No changes were made to the pump or the settings.
Mr. [**Known lastname **]' doctors are aware of his hospitalization and he
will follow up with them shortly after discharge.

Contractures: Due to Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 69570**] and contractures of
his hand, he will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for botox
injections (as well as for his Keppra for seizure control). An
appointment was set up for follow up in [**Month (only) 205**].

2. Respiratory:
Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Per OSH he was acidotic and
hypercapneic. This was based off of VBG. He does seem to be a
CO2 retainer with HCO3 elevated. Baseline CO2 likely 50s - 60s.
Also with some hypoxemia on arrival. Based on CXR and CTAP may
be due to atelectasis. Unclear precipitant but likely
exacerbated by OSA, COPD. Also possible muscle weakness
possible. No clear evidence of COPD exacerbation. He was
initially intubated upon arrival and therefore admitted to the
ICU, he was weaned from the vent and extubated without
difficulty. When stable he was transferred to the floor and did
not have any further respiratory distress.

3. ID:
Urinary Tract Infection: We will need to get OSH culture
results. Upon admission to the ICU he was getting vanc and
unasyn which was broadened to vanco and zosyn. Outside hopsital
culture results were obtained that showed only yeast (>100,000
colonies). Whether treatment was required was discussed with ID
as this may be a colonization and it was felt that since the pt
is now clinically asymptomatic, has no pain and is clinically
doing well, treatment can be deferred. This was particularly
questioned due to the concern for interaction of coumadin and
fluconazole if treatment were pursued.

4. Cardio:
Bradycardia: Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to neurologic
status.
