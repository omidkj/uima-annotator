Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
61 yo male with h/o HTN, DM, OSA (BIPAP at home), no known CAD,
who presented to OSH with 5 day h/o intermittent CP found to
have ST changes, increase troponin c/w MI and transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cath.  Pt was in usual good state of health until 5
days ago when he developed intermittent L sided chest pain at
rest, radiating down L arm and back. Last ~ 1 hr. +diaphoresis.
minimal relief with tylenol/advil at home. Went to hospital last
night as CP associated with SOB/DOE. At [**Hospital1 1474**], O2 92% RA,
tachypnic, [**7-12**] SSCP. pt given SL nitroX3, morphine(4mg IV),
325mg ASA, 40 IV lasix and then nitro ggt.  Troponin 4.6, CK 85.
In ED, no ST/T wave changes and CP relieved with nitro ggt.
Admitted to CCU and then continued to have intermittent CP
despite inc nitro ggt and inc ST elevation in II/AVF. Transfer
for cath.
.
Cath results:
LAD - 90% lesion after D1
LCX -90% proximal
RCA - 50%mid, 70%postlat branch
PCW - 40, PA 65/37
CI: 3.7
Intervention: s/p 3 stent to LAD and 1 stent to Lcx; balloon
pump
Of note, pt hypotensive on transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], but after stenting
in cath lab, pressures improved. Intubated [**2-4**] agitation.
Propofol started--> became hypotensive 50s--> balloon pump
inserted-->  started on dopamine and propofol changed to
fentanyl/versed.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61 yo male with h/o HTN, DMII, +tob, p/w USA s/p cardiac
cath with PCI to LAD/LCx and evidence of R/L inc filling
pressures.

1. CAD - Post MI care including ASA, plavix load - 300mg IV
after cath, followed by 75mg daily X3months, and lipitor 80mg
daily. He received integrilling X18hrs after cath.  Mr [**Known lastname 10083**]
was hyptotensive immediately after his cardiac cath and outpt
antihypertensives were held. However, once abx were started and
he was extubated, his hypotension resolved and carvedilol and
ace-I were started.  CPK was monitored during admission, but
never bumped.  Discussed smoking cessation with patient prior to
discharge, to which he stated that this hospitalization was a
wake up call to him to stop smoking.
.
2. PUMP: Elevated r/l filling pressures values were obtained
during the cardiac cath, and balloon pump initially put in for
afterload reduction. Of note, adequate cardiac output/index
values were obtained during the cath. PCWP was monitored via
arterial line, with goal wedge pressure 15-20. He was given
lasix to maintain goal wedge pressures. Mr. [**Known lastname 10083**] was initally
hypotensive s/p intubation (SBP in 50s) - which was thought
likely to be secondary to the propofol; blood pressures improved
with dopamine and sedation medications were changed to
versed/fentanyl, whic hthe patient tolerated well. Dopamine was
eventually weaned, but took few days due to pneumonia.  Echo
[**6-5**]--> EF 40%, anterior/ distal septal AK and apical AK.  Inital
extubation failed, likely [**2-4**] fluid overload, and patient was
subsequently diuresed and successfully extubated [**6-10**].  He was
continued on lasix after extubation, and discharged on 40mg PO
daily. THis can likely be weaned on f/u with cardiologist within
few weeks of discharge. Given akenesis seen on echo [**6-5**], patient
was started on coumadin 2mg qHS prior to d/c. Spoke with
covering PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 1474**], who agreed that Dr. [**Name (NI) 3314**], pts
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] follow INR.  Will need repeat echo in 3 months, at
which time, length of anticoagulation can be readressed.
.
3. rhythm: nsr, bb for cad; goal HR 50-60 as BP tolerates
.
4. Resp failure/PULM: Initially intubated during cath for pt
safety.  However, right sided infiltrate on CXR (liekly
aspiration PNA based on r-sided dependent infiltrate) delayed
extubation. Given infiltrate on CXR and spike, pt was initially
started on broad spectrum abx with ceftriaxone and flagyl, which
then were changed to meropenem and vanc as patient contiued to
spike fevers, grew GNR in sputum, and was difficult to wean off
vent. ULtimately, his sputum grew pan sensitive E.Coli and abx
were changed to levofloxacin, which he will continue PO as an
outpt to complete a 14 day course of abx. After extubation, pt
remained on oxygen via NC throughout admission, with ambulatory
O2 sats in low 80s. He was discharged on home O2 with VNA to
help monitor respiratory status. He is to follow up with PCP for
reevaluation of oxygen requirement on week of d/c.

.
5. DMII - H/o diabetes on metformin/glyburide as outpt. HgbA1c
was checked during admission and found to be 11.9. Discussed
importance of adhering to diabetic diet/wt loss for improved
glycemic control. Patient was initially on insulin ggt while
intubated and then restarted on glyburide(10mg
[**Hospital1 **])/metformin(500mg [**Hospital1 **]). He is to follow up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]:
adjusting diabetic medications for improved control.

6. Hypernatremia - Pt with increased serum Na (147-149) while
intubated. Resolved with free water bolus.
