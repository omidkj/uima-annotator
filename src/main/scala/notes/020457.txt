Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Atrial thrombus seen on echocardiogram

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Endobronchial biopsy (EBUS)
2. Endobronchial resection of neoplasm invading right bronchus
intermedius


History of Present Illness:
79F w/recent diagnosis afib presents from cardiology clinic for
workup of possible left atrial thrombus visualized on routine
office TTE.

  Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation 2 mos ago, when
she saw her physician for complaining of feeling her heart
fluttering and ongoing fatigue for 3 weeks. EKG showed atrial
fibrillation, TTE at that time showed LVEF 45%. Cardiomyopathy
was attributed to alcohol use because she drinks 2 shots whiskey
nightly in her [**Location (un) **] nightly. She stopped drinking entirely
about 1.5 months ago. Atrial fibrillation has been difficult to
control medically: she was started on sotalol 120 [**Hospital1 **], then
switched to dronedarone 400 [**Hospital1 **], then back to 160 mg sotalol [**Hospital1 **]
about 10 days prior to admission. She had episodes of atrial
fibrillation near daily which she feels and documents by
self-pulse checks. She started pradaxa about 10 days prior to
admission when she called her cardiologist to report  an episode
of atrial fibrillation lasting >48h.

  About 10 days prior to admission she also noted new bilateral
leg edema. No chest pain, pressure, SOB; no nausea/vomiting. She
does describe early satiety/food intolerance (gags on small
amounts of food due to distaste) ongoing for ~2 months. Weight
loss of 14 lbs ([**5-8**] lbs voluntarily before [**Holiday **], 10 lbs
involuntarily since then). She noted no improvement in fatigue
symptoms, also no improvement in dry cough which predated her
fatigue and palpitations by ~1 year and was nonresponsive to
antibiotics (azithromycin) as recently as 2 mos ago.

  On the day of admission her cardiologist performed a repeat
TTE to evaluate for any interval improvement since ETOH
cessation. TTE showed possible [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] or external mass
compressing LA. Patient has been compliant with Pradaxa since
prescribed 10 days prior to admission. She had no neurologic
symptoms - no change speech, vision, hearing, motor, sensation,
concentration or memory. Patient was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] to further
evaluate these TTE findings.

III) IMAGING
CARDIAC CT
IMPRESSION:

1. A large mass involving the right lower medial lung extending
into the
paraesophageal, subcarinal and right hilar mediastinal regions
with invasion
to the pericardium, right atrium, left atrium and compressing
the right
airways causing complete collapse of the right middle lobe and
partial
collapse of the right lower lobe.

2. Moderate right-sided pleural effusion.

3. Enlarged left supraclavicular lymphnode, 6 x 7 mm solid
nodule in the
right lower lobe and a suspicious lytic area in the left
transverse process of
the D1 vertebra and posterior end of the left second rib are
concerning for
the deposits.

4. Uncharacteristic 16 x 17 mm focal hypodensity in the right
lobe of liver
which is only imaged on the unenhanced series. Ultrasound of
liver is
suggested for further evaluation.

Tissue sample can be easily obtained by transbronchial approach
for tissue
diagnosis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

IV) STUDIES: EBUS
Some white-colored mucous plugs were aspirated from the now
visible RML and RLL and sent for culture. RML showed residual
75% obstruction, RLL showed residual 50% obstruction, and the
superior segment RLL was just barely identified. The [**Hospital1 **] had a
residual 40% airway obstruction by extrinsic compression. A
stent was not placed for adequate airway re-canalization. Next,
the flexible
