Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p atrial fibrillation ablation, now requiring temporary pacing
from cath lab

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein ablation.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 yo female with a PMH persistent paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation (s/p three DC cardioversions, last one [**5-15**]) with
uptitration of flecainide and digoxin, persistent left superior
vena cava with moderate TR with thickened tricuspid valve,
history of SVT s/p ablation, hypertension, who was admitted to
the CCU from the cath lab following elective a fib PVI ablation,
intially requiring temporary pacing.
.
During the procedure, two morphologies of left atrial
tachycardia were demonstrated. DC cardioversion was required,
and found to have bradycardia with rates in the 20s. She was
initially paced with a temp wire upon transfer to CCU overnight
for further monitoring.
.
Over the past year, has had multiple recurrences of atrial
fibrillation with uptitrated doses of flecainide. Has had three
prior cardioversions, last one in [**5-15**]. Per prior EP note, has
not complained specifically of palpitations or SOB, though feels
better overall when she is in sinus rhythm.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
Upon reaching the floor, patient with no acute complaints.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Results were
reviewed with the Cardiology Fellow involved with the patient's
care.
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No thrombus in left atrial appendage. Dilated right
ventricle and right atrium with moderate tricuspid regurgitation
and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
69yo female with a PMH of persistent paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation with uptitration of flecainide and digoxin, who was
admitted to the CCU from the cath lab following elective a fib
PVI ablation on [**2102-7-20**].  During the procedure, two morphologies
of left atrial tachycardia were demonstrated. She became
bradycardic after the procedure, and DC cardioversion was
required.  The patient was found to have bradycardia with rates
in the 20s, and she initially required a temporary pacing wire.
She was transfered to the CCU overnight for further monitoring,
but did not require further pacing via the wire overnight. The
wire was removed the following morning, and the patient's HR had
improved.
