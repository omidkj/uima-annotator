History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o with hx of cervical DJD, right arm weakness
who prsents s/p fall in his home this afternoon.

The patient reports that has not been feeling well for the last
few days; he has had what feels like chest congestion with a

chest pain, increased weakness, shortness of breath, seizure
like activity, loss of bladder or bowel continence. He reports
that he woke up this morning because he was not feeling well, he
did not eat anythign. In the early afternoon he was walking
through bedroom, he stumbled and hit his head and face in either
the night stand or the headboard. He reports that he was not

consciousness. He says he recalls most of the time he was lying
there. finally, he was able to get up and called his son and
daughter. His daughter, who lives close by came over and called
the ambulance. The patient denies preceding chest pain,
lightheadedness, leg weakness. He does reports that his is
unstead on his feet and has poor balance and had for some time
now.

Of note, in the ER, the patient reported that he felt
lightheaded and may have tripped, but doesnt remember anything
afterthat. To me, he reports remembering lying in bedroom not

O2sat 94% on RA. He recieved 1.5 L NS, Td booster. He had nasal
laceration and scalp laceration sutured and stapled,
respectively. He had a trauma spine consult. Head CT was
negative. Skull CT showed nondisplaced nasal fracture. CT C
Spine showed retropulsed C5 vertebral body in the setting of
known severe Cervical DJD.

CT c-spine w/o contrast [**2158-2-11**]:
There is no definite evidence of fracture. There is significant
degenerative disease. A grade 1 anterolisthesis of C4 relative
to [**Name (NI) **] is
noted. There is also significant degenerative disc disease with
complete loss of disc space at C5-6 and C6-7. Facet disease is
noted with multilevel neural foraminal stenosis, most notable
through the mid cervical spine. CT is not able to provide
intrathecal detail compared to MRI. Prevertebral soft tissues
appear normal. Given the malalignment at C4-5, the lack of prior
imaging for comparison, ligamentous injury cannot be entirely
excluded. Nuchal ligament ossification is noted. Pooling of
secretion is noted in the region of the hypopharynx. Thyroid
gland appears unremarkable. There is significant pleural
parenchymal scarring at the lung apices.

CXR Portable [**2158-2-11**]: The study is slightly limited by the
obscuration from the underlying trauma board. Allowing for the
limitation,
there is no acute displaced fracture, pneumothorax or pleural
effusions. A
vertical lucent line is seen projecting over the right lateral
lung is
compatible with a skin fold. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits. There is a tortuous descending aortic
arch. An asymmetric elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
noted.

XRAY Right Hand [**2158-2-11**]: AP, lateral, oblique views of the right
hand are obtained. There is soft tissue gas in the region of the
thenar eminence without evidence of foreign body or bony
fracture. Degenerative disease is notable in the basal joint,
first MCP joint and second through fifth DIP joints, compatible
with osteoarthritis. There is also diffuse bony
demineralization. Within the bones of the carpus, osteoarthritis
is noted, most notable along the triscaphe joint with
subchondral cysts. There is also proximal migration of the
capitate, likely on the basis of a SLAC wrist. Radiocarpal
osteoarthritic changes are also noted with joint space loss and
articular surface irregularity.

MRI C-spine [**2158-2-12**]:
1. Severe multilevel, multifactorial degenerative disease with
extensive
chronic alignment abnormalities, among them significant
retrolisthesis of C5 on its neighbors; however, the overall
alignment is not significantly changed since the MR examination
of [**2157-2-26**], with no acute alignment abnormality identified.
2. As above, there is no abnormal STIR-hyperintensity in the
paraspinal
ligaments or other soft tissues to suggest acute injury.
3. Related to above, severe spinal canal stenosis at the C4-5
through C5-6
levels with maximal AP canal diameter of only 5 mm and cord
compression; there is stable abnormal T2-hyperintensity within
the cord at this site,
representing established myelomalacia.
4. Unremarkable diffusion-weighted sequence with, again, no
finding to
specifically suggest acute spinal cord injury.
5. Global cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.

Right Shoulder XRAY [**2158-2-12**]:
Three views of the right shoulder show mild superior and
anterior
subluxation, but no fracture or dislocation. Since there is no
erosion of the underside of the acromion this could be an acute
rotator cuff injury.
Adjacent ribs, scapula, and left clavicle are intact.

CT Head w/o contrast [**2158-2-11**]: Non-contrast head CT with coronal
and sagittal reformations provided. There
