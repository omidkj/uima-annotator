This resumes the previous discharge summary dictated by the
Medical Intensive Care Unit team on this 55-year-old female
with a history of breast cancer with adriamycin induced
cardiomyopathy, who was admitted to the C Med after discharge
from the Medical Intensive Care Unit where she had been
treated for fever, hypotension and mental status changes and
septic physiology without source.  While she was on the floor
with C Med team, she had three main issues:  1.  Her
congestive heart failure medications were adjusted including
her ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, Lasix, Aldactone and
digoxin.  Towards the end of the stay, as these were being
maximized, she had increased BUN and creatinine and some
hyperkalemia, as well as hyponatremia associated with over
diuresis in the setting of ACE inhibitor and Aldactone.  This
resulted in part from the patient refusing laboratory draws
for a period of time and was correcting at the time of
discharge.  2.  The patient was evaluated for fever of
unknown origin.  Multiple cultures were negative and it
eventually resolved without treatment and she had been
afebrile for over a week by the time she had left.  3.  She
received Physical Therapy for rehabilitation after
deconditioning in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  In terms
of nutrition and wound care for wounds resulting from edema
and blood draws at arterial blood gas sites.
