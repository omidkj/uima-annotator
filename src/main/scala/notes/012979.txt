[**Date range (1) 9238**]/09), and was found to have a PNA in the left Lingula. Pt
was started on ceftriaxone/azithro and changed to
cefpodoxime/azithro to complete a 7d course of abx. Her

Renal Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis on the left. Previous
right
nephrectomy. Mild distention of the bladder.

[**2-22**]
CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-21**], the left
costophrenic angle
has been excluded from the image. There is poor definition of
the
hemidiaphragms with opacification at the left base. This may
reflect
increasing pleural effusion in a patient with known multifocal
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 21983**] is an 88 year old female with history of CAD,
hypertension who presents with epigastric and chest pain with
evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
#. Pneumonia, Bacterial NOS: Patient with evidence of new
pneumonia since last admission in LLL. Given new finding, likely
accounts for symptoms with possible contribution of
diaphragmatic irritation accounting for epigastric discomfort
although presentation in total is not classic for pneumonia.  On
transfer to the ICU the pt was initially on BiPAP and was
continued on vancomycin and cefepime (Day 1=[**2-19**]). The pt's WBC
improved on antibiotics. On discharge the pt was continued on
Vanc/Cefepime for a complete 7 day course (last day [**2-26**]).
.
#. Chronic Diastolic CHF, EF > 55%: Pt has worsening pleural
effusions on cxr. The pt has refused lasix during this admission
to the ICU as she says that "water pills" cause her to retain
fluid and not urinate. During the time the pt spent in the ICU
we attempted to maximize blood pressure control, and hydralazine
20mg po q8h was started. The pt intermittently refused this
medication as well.
.
#. ARF ?????? FeNa <1%. The pt had a renal ultrasound on [**2-22**] that
did not show obstruction. The pt's creatinine improved
spontaneously with oral intake.
.
#. Diabetes II: Blood sugar with reasonable control on
admission. She was monitored on sliding scale, diabetic diet.
.
#. Chest Pain: Patient has a known history of CAD and
experienced intermittent chest pain during this admission. The
pt had negative troponins during this admission and the chest
pain was thought to be related to the pt's baseline angina and
interval pneumonia as above. The pt's home Aspirin, Plavix,
Statin and Metoprolol were continued.
.
#. Hypertension, benign: Patient with elevated BP with SBP near
220 in ED, improved after having received her home medications.
The pt was continued on her outpatient regimen of Clonidine
patch, Nifedipine, Metoprolol and hydralazine was added.
.
#. Chronic UTIs: The pt was continued on Nitrofurantoin per
outpatient regimen. THe pt did not complain of urinary
discomfort during this admission, and a UA was negative. Urine
culture did grow 10,000-100,000 of Vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus, but since the pt has no complaints of dysuria the
decision was made to not treat the pt's asymptomatic bacturia.
.
#. Code - DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient on admission. After
discussion with pt??????s family on [**2-22**] family confirmed that they
wanted to continue abx, but allow pt to have morphine for SOB
and the family confirmed that pt will be DNR DNI.
