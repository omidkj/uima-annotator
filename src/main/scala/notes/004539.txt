History of Present Illness:
This 78 year old gentleman is s/p CABG in early [**Month (only) 1096**] at [**Hospital 7302**] was transferred to nursing home for rehab
on [**11-30**] after several falls out of bed. He was then readmitted
to [**Hospital6 3105**] on [**2146-12-3**] after developing acute
pulmonary edema/CHF/unresponsiveness?. There was a question
whether he had a small MI; he reportedly had a small NQWMI. He
improved with diuresis and was not intubated. Since admission
has had an altered mental status and there is concern for
possible hypoxic encephalopathy. The patient was going to be
recathed, but this has been on hold pending mental status
clearing. CT scan of the head was reportedly negative. Patient
is reportedly non-verbal and agitated at baseline. Prior to this
CABG, the patient was apparently a active gentlemen doing ADLs.
Patient was apparently given ativan prior to transfer. His wife
is present and states that he is slightly more somnolent after
ativan; but has had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
.
Pt is now referred for further management at [**Hospital1 18**]. Case
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who agreed to take pt on [**Hospital Unit Name **].

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**12-13**]:
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or mass
effect.
There is moderate cerebral atrophy with associated prominence of
the sulci and ventricles. Few foci of low density in the
periventricular white matter adjacent to the frontal horns of
the lateral ventricles likely represent mild chronic small
vessel ischemic disease in a patient of this age. Calcifications
are noted in the internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
The imaged bones appear unremarkable. There is opacification of
a left
posterior ethmoid air cell.
.
CXR [**2146-12-12**]:
No previous images. Intact midline sternal sutures are seen
related to previous CABG procedure. Cardiac silhouette is
somewhat prominent, as is the tortuosity of the descending
aorta. However, no evidence of vascular congestion or acute
focal pneumonia.
.
[**2146-12-14**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?MVP?). An eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of at least mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No mitral valve vegetation is seen but
the images are suboptimal. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better to exclude a
valvular vegetation and to better assess the basis and severity
of mitral regurgitation.
.
[**2146-12-16**] TEE:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild prolapse of the anterior mitral
leaflet. There is small (3 x 5 mm) vegetation on the tip of the
anterior mitral leaflet. An associated posteriorly-directed jet
of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small mitral valve vegetation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.
.
CT torso [**2146-12-16**]:
1. No nidus of infection found to explain patient's
endocarditis.
2. Partially thrombosed right superficial femoral artery
pseudoaneurysm
measuring 2.5 cm.
3. 7-mm pulmonary nodule. If the patient is at high risk for
lung cancer,
followup CT at 6-12 months is recommended. (If the patient is
considered low risk, followup CT at 12 months is recommended).
.
P-mibi [**2146-12-19**]: no ischemic symptoms or ECG changes.
MIBI:
1. Fixed, large, mild intensity inferior wall perfusion defect.
2.  Normal LV cavity size, post-CABG septal hypokinesis, and
probably slightly reduced systolic function (qualitatively EF
appears to be 40-45%).
.
colonoscopy [**2146-12-15**]:
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and descending colon
Blood in the colon
Ulceration and erythema in the rectum compatible with ischemic
colitis
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
[**2146-12-15**] EGD:
Erythema and erosion in the stomach body and antrum compatible
with erosive gastritis
Ulcer in the duodenal bulb (injection, endoclip)
Erythema in the second part of the duodenum and duodenal bulb
compatible with duodenitis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG, DM2, CHF,
admitted with altered mental status and GI bleed found to have
duodenal ulcer, ischemic rectal colitis, and vancomycin
sensitive enteroccocal and staph mitral valve endocarditis.
.
Patient was initially admitted to the Cardiology service for an
NSTEMI for possible cath. However, cardiac enzymes on admission
were negative. He then began to have GI bleeding and was found
to have positive blood cultures, eventually attributed to
endocarditis. See below for problem specific hospital course.

# endocarditis: high grade bacteremia with enterococcus and coag
negative staph
