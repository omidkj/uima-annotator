none

History of Present Illness:
72yo female with h/o DM2, ESRD on HD, CHF, s/p TKA,
hypothyroidism, COPD on home 2L, OSA admitted to vascular
service on [**11-3**] for mgmt of ischemic left toe ulcer transferred
to the MICU for AMS and respiratory acidosis.
.
Per family, protracted hospital course began in late [**Month (only) 216**]. At
that time hospitalized at [**Month (only) **] on [**9-23**] for "stomach bug". She was
treated for dehydration and discharged to rehab after 3d stay.
During that hospitalization note made of small pressure ulcer on
left heel, left toe. Patient was discharged to rehab were
worsening heel pain limited participation in PT. Patient
underwent I&D of left LE ulcer on [**10-17**]. At that time she was
placed on standing oxycodone 5mg Q6hr for heel pain. Per family
after initiation of meds patient noted to be "solumulent".
Increasing somulence promptped admission to [**Hospital6 **]
on [**10-21**] for AMS. At that time sats "low" BP 90/40, HR 90s T99.2.
(baseline SBPs 100s). Labs notable for CK 773, elevated
biomarkers, WBC at that time 16.5, echo 55% with pulmonary htn,
PA systolic pressure of 70mmHg. A nuclear stress showed
questionable apical ischemia, with an EF 39%. During that
admission she was noted to have ischemic LLE ulcers and a sacral
decub. MRI L food showed no osteo. Cx grew MRSA. Pt was
allegedly discharged on vanc and pain meds. Increased periods of
lethargy and hypotension were attributed to pain medications. Of
note during that hospitalization HD on 20, 21 (mri with
contrast), 22 (fluid mgmt) missed.
Patient again discharged to rehab on [**10-31**] and again found to be
somulent and unrousable with SBPs in 90s. At that time taken to
[**Month/Year (2) **]; En route to [**Name (NI) **] pt was noted to be lethargic, SBPs 80s-90s,
WBC 19.4 with 7% bandemia, MB 16.4 and trop 2.4. Pt was
determined to have NSTEMI, EKG showed low voltage. CE
downtrended. No aspirin given hx of allergy. SBPs 90s-100s. AMS
was felt to be [**3-12**] opiates.
they d/c oxycodone and started on tyl3; swabbed left heel +
MRSA, ?amptuation therefore transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for 2nd vascular
surgery opinion
.
On the vascular surgerical service patient maintained on hep
gtt; and started on vanco, flagyl and cipro. Vascular studies
obtained. No opiate medications administered. Per chart biopsy
SBPs 70s-90s. On evening of [**11-5**], gas obtained for unknown
reasons with ph 7.14, no follow interventions performed.

On morning of transfer patient noted to be more lethargic with
consistently poor VBG. Decision made to transfer to the medical
ICU for evaluation and treatment.

Patient Deceased on [**2121-11-18**]

Pertinent Results:
CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, shift of
normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or acute large
vascular
territorial infarction. Periventricular and subcortical white
matter
hypodensities are consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci are
consistent with age-related involutional change. Calcifications
are seen of the bilateral cavernous carotid and vertebral
arteries. Aside from minimal mucosal thickening or fluid within
the right sphenoid sinus, the visualized portions of the
paranasal sinuses are well aerated. Opacification of multiple
bilateral mastoid air cells versus congenital under
pneumatization of the mastoids is noted. Aerosolized secretions
are seen within the nasopharynx. The imaged osseous structures
are grossly unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
VENOUS DUPLEX, LOWER EXTREMITY
Duplex evaluation was performed of both greater saphenous veins.
Right
greater saphenous vein is patent with diameters of 0.16-0.48.
The left greater 0.22-0.44.
IMPRESSION: Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins with
diameters as noted. On the right, there are somewhat diminutive
features calf to ankle. On the left, diminutive features from
the knee to ankle
.
ARTERIAL DOPPLER LOWER EXTREMITY
Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity
arterial systems at rest. All waveforms are monophasic at the
femoral to the dorsalis pedis
artery. Pulsed volume recordings show significant artifact
complicating the readings, but are dampened throughout, more
significantly on the left than on the right.
IMPRESSION: Somewhat difficult study due to noncompressible
vessels and
significant patient movement, but significant aortobiiliac or
proximal femoral artery occlusive disease. In addition, there is
likely severe multilevel disease, especially on the left side
with flow deficit to the ankle and forefoot.


Brief Hospital Course:
72yo female with h/o DM2, ESRD on HD, CHF, s/p TKA,
hypothyroidism, COPD on home 2L, OSA initially admitted to
vascular service on [**11-3**] for mgmt of ischemic left toe ulcer,
transferred to the MICU for AMS and respiratory acidosis. After
protracted hospital course and refractory
pain/hypotension/decreased respiratory drive she was made CMO in
MICU on [**11-15**] and she expired on [**2121-11-18**] at 12:05pm.
.
# Goals of care. Patient with protracted hospital course with
evidence of refractory hypotension, altered mental status and
chronic pain. After extensive discussion with the family, MICU
team and palliative care consultants decision made to transition
to DNI/DNR. Patient made CMO on [**11-15**]. She was treated with
Morphine drip with Q30min Morphine boluses. She expired on
[**2121-11-18**] at 12:05pm with her son and daughter at bedside. PCP
was notified and death report/certificate completed.
.
# Respiratory Acidosis. Unclear duration (acute v chronic) as
well as etiology. Little former data to compare recent findings.
In addition, dialysis dependance makes tracking HCO3 in chem
panels unreliable. However suspected this was an acute and
chronic problem in patient with known COPD. Posible etiolgies
include: depression of the central respiratory center by
cerebral disease or drugs, inability to ventilate adequately due
to neuromuscular disease (e.g., myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], AML, GBS),
severe hypothyroid, or airway obstruction related to COPD
exacerbation. Patient without e/o COPD exacerbation (no wheeze).
?med effect however no note of recent narcotic/benzos since
admission on [**11-3**]. Patient electively intubated to improve
ventilation and therefore improve acid base status. Its unclear
what caused acute decompenation
