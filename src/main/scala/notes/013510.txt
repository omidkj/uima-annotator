Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim Ds / Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, hypotension, anemia, guaiac positive stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization - one of your coronary arteries was
expanded with a balloon to improve blood flow to your heart.  No
stents were placed.
2. Upper endoscopy (EGD) - no abnormalities were noted in your
esophagus, stomach or duodenum
3. Colonoscopy - diverticuli (little out-pouchings) were
observed in the wall of your colon. These are very common.
Occasionally they can bleed and they may have been the cause of
your recent GI bleed, although they were not noted to be
bleeding during the colonoscopy study.

History of Present Illness:
69M with PMHx significant for MDS, prior ETOH abuse, CAD and
systolic CHF (EF 40%) who presented to the ED from his
hematologist's office with hypotension, dyspnea, anemia and
guaiac positive stools. He complained of worsened dyspnea and
his BP was noted to be 87/52, he had black guaiac positive stool
on exam. He was given a 250cc NS bolus in the office and
referred to the ED.  In the ED his VS 85/38 HR 57 RR 18 98.1 99%
2L NC.  He was again found to have gross blood on rectal exam at
that time. His hematocrit was 24.4 down from recent  baseline of
29-30.  He had 2 PIVs placed and was given 40mg IV protonix,
1500cc NS, and 1unit PRBCs.  NG lavage clear. GI and surgery
were consulted.
.
On ROS he reports having chronic progressive dyspnea for the
past 8 months, however he notes that his dyspnea has worsened
over the past 1-2 weeks with approximately 4 days of darker
stools.  These symptoms are associated with decreased energy.
He denies lightheadedness or syncope, no nausea, vomiting or
hematemesis. No abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation.  He
has not had chest discomfort; his anginal equivalent seems to be
jaw pain which he will have regularly for which he uses nitro
patches and he has noticed an increase in these symptoms lately.
 No orthopnea or PND.  No recent weight gain or increase in LE
edema.  No recent EtOH or NSAID use.  No prior history of GI
bleeding or GERD.   He reports recent medication changes were an
increase in his furosemide in [**3-/2121**] and an increase in his
lisinopril from 5 to 10mg last month. Unsure of 'baseline' BP
number, states he knows it has been low lately.  At last PCP
visit was 90/40, prior values for past two months from office
visits 120-130s.  At time of arrival to the MICU his VS had
improved with BP 115/49, he stated he felt like he had more
energy after receiving a unit of PRBCs.  Denied any pain.  Rest
of review of systems was negative in detail.

Brief Hospital Course:
The following problems were managed during this admission:
.
#1 NSTEMI: Patient was transferred from the MICU to the floor on
[**6-8**].  That night, he underwent bowel prep for colonoscopy to
investigate source of GI bleed. He reports having a "difficult"
night with significant diarrhea and nearly no sleep. Early the
following morning (~6:30 am), patient began experiencing
jaw/neck pain; as this is his anginal equivalent, an EKG was
obtained.  EKG showed new ST depression in V5, V6 but the 1st
set of cardiac enzymes negative.  The pain was similar to his
usual once-a-week anginal equivalent pain which is typically
responsive to SL nitro.  This episode was mostly relieved with
SL nitro x 4 tabs and morphine 1 mg IV x 2 doses.  After these
medications, the pain was gone but patient reports feeling
residual "neck pulsations." This symptom prompted a carotid
artery US study, which showed 60-70% stenosis bilaterally. The
second set of cardiac enzymes returned positive, and the patient
was transferred to the cardiology service. He went for cardiac
catheterization on [**6-11**]; balloon angioplasty was performed but
no stents placed.  He had an uneventful recovery from this
procedure.
.
#2 GIB:  There was one report of black stool, which was
suspicious for upper GI source. DDX included PUD, gastritis.  On
ED exam, rectal exam was grossly bloody, which could indicate
brisk upper bleed versus lower source, ddx includes AVMs,
diverticula, mass, hemorrhoids.  Pt has been hemodynamically
stable since initial resuscitation. No further bleeding episodes
in ICU or on the floor. Of note, it seemed as if pt was having
oozing intially, as his Hct did not bump as expected after each
unit of pRBC. He was transfused a total of 4 U pRBC. However, he
had a delayed reponse with rapid Hct rise in subsequent days.
Once on the floor, patient had one "dark" bowel movement which
was not saved for guaiac; subsequent bowel movements were
normal-colored although soft consisten
