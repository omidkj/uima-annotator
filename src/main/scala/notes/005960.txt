CHIEF COMPLAINT:  chest pain
.
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
65 yo male with history of coronary artery disease
status post BMS to proximal and distal LAD in [**2174**] (not on
plavix at
home now), diabetes type II, PVD status post left iliac stent,
non-small cell lung cancer s/p left lobe pneumonectomy, Stage
III COPD presents with chest pain since 4 am at rest. Pain woke
him up from sleep, [**9-5**] substernal, constant pain which
gradually began to radiate down left shoulder. He took SLNTG X1
with no relief. He waited until 8AM when he began to develop
SOB, nausea, no vomiting, diaphoresis. SOB prompted him to call
his sister who lives upstairs who then called ambulance.
.
Per pt, since his last MI in [**2174**], he had been chest pain free
until the past year. Then, this past year, he has started to
develop 15 minutes of substernal chest pain, less severe than
today, which goes away after 15 minutes. He has 1 episode every
3-4 months, and ocur only when he is exerting himself (ie
carrying groceries). Normally, he can walk around [**Company 79153**] warehouse
without CP and can climb 2 flights of stairs before becoming
SOB. These activities do not always elicit CP. He denies any
PND, orthopnea, LE swelling, claudication symptoms.
.
In ED, BP 100/60; HR 118. EKG with ST elevations V3-V6. Given
4000 units heparin in ED, plavix 600 mg, and ASA 325 mg in the
field. Still with chest pain when presented to cath lab despite
2 SL nitro.
.
In cath lab, received integrillin, hep gtt. C. Cath revealed
LMCA nl, LAD 70% after proximal stent then TO without
collaterals, RCA 60% diffusely diseased. BMS placed in mid LAD.
Pt received dopamine briefly (for 10 minutes) for cardiogenic
shock. IABP placed 1:1. BP stabilized in 90-100's.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain, although does report
thigh cramps with walking relieved with quinine.  All of the
other review of systems were negative.


Past Medical History:
# Hypertension.
# High cholesterol.
# Gout.
# Peripheral vascular disease with a left iliac artery stent
[**2174**].
# Diabetes mellitus:
# Non-small-cell lung carcinoma: status post left pneumonectomy
# Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
# COPD: PFT's [**10-3**]: Marked obstructive ventilatory defect. The
reduced FVC is likely due to gas trapping but a coexisting
restrictive defect cannot be excluded. Suggest lung volume
measurements if clinically indicated.
FVC 62% predicted
FEV1 39 %predicted
FEV1/FVC 63% predicted


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use; quit in [**2173**] and prior smoked 60 pack years; There is no
history of alcohol abuse.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.  Father had CAD in old age. Sister with MVP.

[**11-15**]: Cath
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a
normal
LMCA. The LAD had a 70% stenosis after the proximal stent and
then a
total occlusion without collateral flow. The LCX was diffusely
diseased.
The RCA was diffusely diseased with a large RV branch that was
also
diffusely diseased with up to 60% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling
pressures
with an RASP of 19 mm Hg, RVEDP 23 mm Hg, and PASP of 62 mm Hg.
The
cardiac output was 3.6 and cardiac index 1.7 l/min/m2 suggesting

cardiogenic shock.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal-mid left
anterior
descending artery with two overlapping Vision (3x23mm;3x18mm)
bare metal
stents.  Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically
apparent
dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow with poor
myocardial
blush (See PTCA comments).
5.  Successful placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
via the
right common femoral artery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal-mid left
anterior
descending artery with two overlapping bare metal stents.
5. Successful placement of an IABP via the right common femoral
artery.

[**11-18**] Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed a patent LAD at previously stented sites.  The LCx had
a 60%
OM1 stenosis.  The RCA was not injected.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed aortic systolic pressure of
108 mm
Hg.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.
4.  Intraaortic balloon pump was inserted via the right common
femoral
artery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Widely patent LAD at site of previously placed stents.
2. Successful placement of intraaortic balloon pump.
.
[**11-28**] Cath:
1. Successful stenting of the OM branch with a 2.5 X 18 mm Mini
Vision
bare metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments
for
detail).
2. Successful stenting of the RCA with a 2.25 X 15 mm Mini
Vision bare
metal stent with no residual stenosis (see PTCA comments for
detail).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the OM and RCA with bare metal stents.

.
[**11-17**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the anterior
wall, dyskinesis of the mid to distal septum and apex, and
hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferior and inferolateral
walls. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). NO
ventricular septal defect is seen. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal with borderline depressed free wall motion. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. The
