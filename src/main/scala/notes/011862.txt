Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5301**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
76-year-old male with hx CAD s/p IMI [**2189**], CHF with EF 15%, PVD,
CRI (on Epo) recently admitted for LGIB who presents from [**Hospital1 1501**]
(after [**Hospital 5610**] Rehab) with increased SOB/DOE and decreased
mental status.
.
On [**12-28**], patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 **] for three
to four days of progressive weakness and fatigue, was found to
have a hematocrit of 26 and was transfused and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. At [**Hospital1 18**], had an endoscopy as well as colonoscopy, which
were unremarkable. He was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-31**],
subsequently had an outpatient small bowel capsule study, which
showed an AVM at 2.5 hours into the jejunum suggesting that it
is beyond the reach of the endoscope. He has been receiving [**12-3**]
transfusion every month when these are needed for coronary
event. Pt has been seen by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] who recommended a
double-balloon enteroscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10395**] at [**Hospital1 498**],
[**Hospital1 1559**]. He was discharged from [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-21**] to a [**Hospital1 1501**].
.
He comes back today for increased fatigue, SOB/DOE, and
decreased mental status. HCT today is 33.8 form 33.4. Pt poor
historian non conversant.
.
In ED, T 101.2 HR 68  BP 115/54  RR 26 O2 sat 92-93% on 5LNC,
then 97% on NRB. CXR suggestive of severe pulm edema/CHF, and he
was given lasix 40 IV, guaiac positive, Hct 34 so no [**Hospital1 **]
transfused, protonix 40IV, Vanc 1gm IV, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV. He
was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
.
He denies any fever, chills, chest pain, hematemesis, nausea,
vomting, abdominal pain, but does relate an approximate 20 pound

weight loss over the past three months.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o CHF, pna

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with crackles, hypoxia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o CHF, pna
HISTORY: 75-year-old male with hypoxia and concern for CHF or
pneumonia.

COMPARISON: [**2199-12-29**].

FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates stable
moderate cardiomegaly with unchanged mediastinal contours. The
patient is status post sternotomy. Sternal sutures and
left-sided transvenous pacemaker leads are unchanged. Again
noted is fracture of the most inferior sternal suture. The
pulmonary vasculature is engorged, and peripheral Kerley B lines
are noted. There are small bilateral pleural effusions and
associated bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. The
bones are demineralized.

IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: The patient is a 76 y/o M with significant cardiac hx, EF
15%, smoking hx who presents with SOB
.
# Resp distress: Most likely [**1-3**] early pneumonia (? aspiration)
as well as CHF exacerbation. Given low EF, he has very poor
forward flow and may be total body depleted, but still have pulm
edema. A BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 17514**], consistent with an element of CHF, and
cardiac enzymes were slightly elevated to 0.11. However, in the
context of elevated creatinine, likely does not reflect ACS. He
was diuresed with standing lasix and fluid restricted. He was
started on vanc/cefepime to cover for aspiration and hospital
acquired pathogens. Standing nebs and mucinex were used to
improve air intake and secretions. He was started on a
prednisone taper. Upon transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] medicine service, he
was felt unlikely to have a pneumonia and antibiotics were
discontinued. The patient was seen by the renal consult team. He
was felt to be significantly volume overloaded and was
aggressively diuresed.  He initially was diuresed with a
thiazide-lasix IV combination, but was on a po combination by
discharge. The patient was discharged on 100 mg po Lasix alone,
after being stable on this dose for several days, 500-1 L neg.
He was off oxygen at discharge, but likely to require some
during exertion given his deconditioning.
.
# Lower GI bleed: The patient has a known AVM seen on capsule
endoscopy thought distal to enteroscopy capabilities. He is a
chronic, low volume GI bleeder. He is a poor operative
candidate, at this point he is not profusely bleeding and does
not need emergent surgery. His hcts were maintained above 28
with one unit pRBCs. His plavix and asa were held. He was also
maintained on a ppi. The patient may consider outpatient
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10395**] at [**Hospital1 498**] [**Hospital1 1559**] for
double-balloon enteroscopy as recommended by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] at a
prior evaluation.  His hematocrit was stable throughout the
hospitalization.
.
# Leukocytosis. Etiology unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures were without
growth, stool culture and C Diff toxin assay were also negative.
The patient's leukocytosis resolved and was taken off of empiric
pneumonia antibiotics as above.
.
# CRI/Uremia. The patient was near his baseline Cr, though with
a BUN >100. On transfer to the Medicine floor service, the
patient was evaluated by renal. He was felt likely to be uremic
with asterixis on exam and a question of mental status changes.
The most likely etiology of his renal failure was felt due to
chronic CHF. The patient was aggressively diuresed.  He
underwent renal artery ultrasound to rule out renal artery
stenosis, which was negative. The patient also had an echo for
rule out pericardial effusion in the setting of uremia and a
question of a rub (though without pulsus), which was also
negative. All meds were renally dosed. The renal team thought
there were no acute indications for hemodialysis given that he
was responsive to diuretics.  At discharge, the renal team
recommended that the patient be titrated for a fluid balance of
negative 1 liter daily.  It is likely that in the future, the
patient will require hemodialysis.
.
# CAD. Stable. No signs of acute MI and with negative cardiac
enzymes. The patient was continued on metoprolol, hydral, imdur,
zocor. His lisinopril was held in the setting of renal failure
and uremia. H
