History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 yo M with history of stage 4 NSCLC w/ mets to the
sternum who presents with fever, hemoptysis and SOB. Pt was
recently hospitalized in [**Month (only) **] at which time he had a talc
pleurodesis done on the left side due to malignant pleural
effusion. He was then discharged home on levofloxacin for
possible PNA for 10 days. Pt states he continued to have
persistent fevers despite the anitbiotics. On [**3-16**] he was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and at that time his chemo regimen was changed to
Tarceva after having failed both taxol/carboplatin and taxotere.
He said after starting this chemo he developed some diarrhea, no
N/V. He has had a persistent dry cough up until 2 days ago when
he noted hemoptysis and sputum production from his cough. Also
developed progressive SOB over the past few days with
fevers/chills. Cough is associated with right sided pleuritic
chest pain. He currently denies any N/V, CP, dysuria, focal
weakness, weight loss. Pt does have h/o of TB in right apices 50

.
ONC History: Begins in [**2-11**] when pt was visiting his father in
[**Name (NI) 651**] and developed fever/cough.  At that time he had a CT scan
done which found a nodule in the LLL.  Pt then had this nodule
rescanned in [**Location (un) 86**] with subsequent scans that showed interval
increase in size.  He then underwent bronchoscopy and sampling
of pleural effusion  in [**11-11**] which demonstrated poorly
differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.  Staging PET scan
showed lesion in the sternum for metastatic disease.  He then
began chemotherapy with 2 cycles  [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with no response.
Switched to Taxotere for 2 cycles and once again no response,
then started on Tarceva on [**2107-3-16**].

CXR Interval progression of the left lower lobe opacity with
interval progression of bilateral upper lobe interstitial
opacities. These findings may be consistent with pulmonary edema
or changes related to radiation therapy. Lymphangitic spread of
tumor cannot be excluded. If clinically indicated, examination
with CT of the chest may be considered.

CTA Chest
1. Interval development of new extensive ground glass opacities
within the right upper lobe, patchy ground glass opacity within
the right middle lobe, and interval worsening of consolidation
within the left lower lobe with air bronchograms, findings all
of which suggest worsening multifocal pneumonia.
2. Relatively stable appearance of loculated small left pleural
effusion with enhancing and nodular thickening of the pleural
rim.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. No CT evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transfered to the ICU on HD #2 secondary to
increased hypoxia.  A chest xray revealed what appeared to be
multifocul pnuemonia.  Patient was kept on NRB mask overnight
however the next day patient continued to fatigue and after
discussion with the patient he was intubated.  Patient was
continued on broad spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of
pnuemonia even though no cultures came back positive.  He
continued to deteriorate while intubated and it was felt that he
went into ARDS based on his chest x-ray.  Patient was switched
to ARDSnet vent settings.  At one point patient became
hypotensive and had poor urine output.  He was started on
pressors which were able to be weaned off and his urine output
did improve slightly.  However is oxygenation requirements
continued to increase.  He was proned, and mutiple alveolar
recruitment efforts were tried for better oxygenation which only
produced minimal improvement.  After mutiple discussions with
the family they intitially wanted to continue with aggresive
treatment since the patient had one daughter in [**Name (NI) 651**] who the
family wanted to be present before the patient passed away.
However as the patient's oxygenation continued to deteriorate
even on maximal support his wife decided to stop aggresive
treatment and make patient comfort measures only.  Patient
expired soon after.
