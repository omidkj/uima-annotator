CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man s/p CABG and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after pneumothorax
and chest tube removal.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2127-3-8**].

The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal
of the Swan-Ganz catheter and mediastinal drain.

The post-sternotomy wires are intact. The mild cardiomegaly is
present slightly exaggerated by presence of the low lung
volumes. There is no evidence of failure. There is no
appreciable pleural effusion. Linear atelectasis at the left
base is again noted. There is no appreciable pneumothorax.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s)
LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Mildly depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. No
AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**1-1**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded, yet the apical segment,
the mid portion of the anterior septum and apical portion of the
septum appear hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. Tip of the
intraoartic balloon pump is in good position.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No aortic
stenosis is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine and
phenylephrine infusion. Pt was AV paced upon separation from
CPB.

1. Biventricular function unchanged from the pre-bypass period ,
LVEF 40-45%, with noted improvement of the apical segment, the
mid portion of the anterior septum and apical portion of the
septum.

2. The aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.

3. The position of the IABP remains in good position.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-3-7**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed significant left main disease and
an IABP was placed. He was taken urgently to the operating room
the following morning where he underwent a CABG x 3. He was
given 48 hours of vancomycin as he was in the hospital
preoperatively. He was extubated later that same day. His IABP
was removed on POD #1. He was transferred to the floor on POD
#2. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. His
preoperative aspirin, beta blockade and statin were resumed. He
worked with physical therapy daily. Mr. [**Known lastname **] did well
postoperatively and was ready for discharge home on POD#4. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.
