CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year-old Chinese
speaking only female who has a history of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy who was originally admitted on [**2143-2-21**] with
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  The bulk of that course is
dictated in the discharge summary by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  At
that time she was given intravenous fluids with improvement
of her nausea, vomiting and improvement of her diarrhea.  At
that time her urinalysis was notable for urinary tract
infection and she was started on Ciprofloxacin for treatment.
On [**2143-2-25**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] became hypotensive to systolics of 70 to
90 over diastolics of 40s to 60s.  This was minimally
responsive to 2 liters of intravenous fluids and she was
transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit for intravenous pressors
and further monitoring.  Her urine culture was notable for
Methacillin resistant staph aureus and at that time she was
started on Vancomycin.

In the Coronary Care Unit the right IJ cordis and Swan-Ganz
was placed as well as an arterial line.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was placed
initially on neo-synephrine, but this was quickly weaned off
in a few hours.  Her hypertension did resolve.  Swan numbers
were notable for SCRs in the 900s with slightly increased
cardiac index.  Pulmonary wedge pressures were high at 19.
during the Coronary Care Unit stay her hospital course was
notable for titration of beta blocker and Verapamil.  It was
also noted that Ms. [**Known lastname **] did require high preloads with peaked
PA diastolics of 18 to 30 and pulmonary wedge pressures
around 19.  Echocardiogram was done on [**2143-2-25**] showing an
EF of 75 to 80%, left ventricular hypertrophy and outlet
obstruction.  Alcohol septal ablation was considered, but
this decision will be reviewed at a later time.  Her Coronary
Care Unit was also notable for a seven beat run and
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on [**2143-2-26**] and four
beat run on [**2143-3-2**].  Electrolytes were within normal
limits.  She may require ICD at a later time.

On [**2143-2-28**] Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transferred back to the floor for
further management of her multiple issues.  On [**2143-3-1**] she
was noted to have increased neck retractions and altered
mental status.  An arterial blood gas was done showing a pH
of 7.27, PCO2 78 and PO2 of 78.  This was repeated in the
next couple of hours with minimal improvement of her pH to
7.3 and decrease of POC2 to 72.  This time she was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for possible
noninvasive ventilation.  Her chest x-ray was notable for a
new left lower lobe infiltrate, versus consolidation.  She
was started empirically on Levaquin for a possible pneumonia.
She was afebrile during her stay, however, her white blood
cell count was up to 28 after receiving one dose of Neupogen,
which will be discussed later.  In the Medical Intensive Care
Unit she underwent BiPAP treatment for approximately one
hour.  Her PCO2 improved from 72 to 67.  However, there was
no change in her mental status and BiPAP was discontinued.
It was thought that her respiratory issues were secondary to
continued fluid overload and she was diuresed aggressively.
However, at the time of transfer from the MICU her bicarb was
now 40 up from 34 with PCO2 still in the 70s.

1.  Cardiovascular:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
with left ventricular outflow obstruction.  She has super
normal EF.  As stated above she may benefit from possible
alcohol septal ablation.  She has been diuresed aggressively
with elevation of bicarb.  BUN and creatinine has been
stable.  She currently has clear respiratory examination with
only occasional crackles.

2.  Electrophysiology:  As stated above she has had multiple
runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  Her
electrolytes have been normal.  She will require ICD at a
later time.

3.  Infectious disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has been treated with
Vancomycin for Methacillin resistant staph aureus urinary
tract infection.  She has received seven days of Vancomycin.
Her repeat cultures have been negative.  Her Vancomycin will
be discontinued at this time.  All blood cultures have been
negative.  As stated above she had been on Levaquin for two
days for possible left lower infiltrate, but in light of her
negative clinical examination this was discontinued.  TTE was
negative for vegetations and transesophageal echocardiogram
was held secondary to the vergility of the patient.  This may
need to be considered if the patient becomes septic in any
way for possible endocarditis.

4.  Hematology:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] had decreasing counts in all lines
including white cells, hematocrit and platelet.  Hematology
consult was obtained who thought these were side effects of
colchicine.  Her hematocrit has ranged between 27 and 30.
Her platelets have been stable between 70 and 120.  Her white
blood cell count decreased to 1.8 and she was started on
Neupogen empirically.  She received one dose and her white
blood cell count subsequently increased to 12 and then to
28,000.  This did finally come down five days after Neupogen
was given.  Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was ____ negative.  She had DIC
laboratories notable for increased fibrin split products
increased D-dimer and haptoglobin less then 20.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have increased
liver enzymes with peaked AST of 374 and peak ALT of 303.
These both are now back to normal.  Her alkaline phosphatase
peaked at 134.  Bilirubin has always been 0.5.  This may be
secondary to possible congestive heart failure.  However,
ultrasound was done of the abdomen showing dilated common
bile duct approximately 1.3 cm in diameter.  There were no
stones noted.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.
The common bile duct was dilated to the pancrease head, but
there was no sign of pancreatic mass.  Liver enzymes
continued to be monitored.  She was prepared for CT of the
abdomen, but was unable to have the test secondary to her
respiratory distress.  She may require a CT for invasive
evaluation such as endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography at a later time.

6.  Respiratory:  As stated above Ms. [**Known lastname 46293**] PCO2 did range
from 57 to 60 during her Coronary Care Unit stay.  No prior
arterial blood gases have been taken.  Her bicarb increased
from 22 to 33 during the Coronary Care Unit stay.  During the
MICU stay her bicarb increased from 34 to 40.  Her numbers
were consistent with a respiratory acidosis, which per
Coronary Care Unit report did improve minimally with
diuresis.  However, after diuresis in the MICU her
respiratory acidosis slightly worsened perhaps as a result of
her contraction alkalosis.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] apparently has never had
pulmonary function tests.  She is not a chronic smoker.  Her
bicarb on [**2143-1-9**] per primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 26.
Per pulmonary consult she may require CT of the chest to
evaluate for interstitial disease.  She may also benefit from
sleep apnea study or other evaluation for neuromuscular
disease.

7.  Coronary artery disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] did have some chest
pain when she initially presented.  This was likely secondary
to volume depletion with known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
She was ruled out for myocardial infarction twice.  She was
continued on aspirin once a day, Metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d.,
which will be increased as needed and Lipitor 10 mg po q day.


8.  Prophylaxis:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was continued on Pneumoboots and
proton pump inhibitor.

9.  Access:  PICC line was placed in the Coronary Care Unit
on [**2143-2-28**].  She was noted to have some swelling in the
left upper extremity and ultrasound was done to rule out deep
venous thrombosis.  This was negative.

DISPOSITION:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is full code.  She will be transferred
to [**Hospital 4415**] at this time.
