HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  This 48-year-old female presented to
an outside hospital Emergency Department complaining of
dyspnea, orthopnea and PND.  She had approximately 1 month of
shortness of breath with increasing fatigue and dyspnea on
exertion x 1 year.  She denied any chest pain.  Her
echocardiogram at the outside hospital showed an ejection
fraction of 25 percent with diffuse left ventricular
hypokinesis and she did not rule in for a myocardial
infarction by enzymes.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a
catheterization, which showed 3 plus mitral regurgitation and
she was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for mitral valve repair versus
replacement.  She reported palpitations but no chest pain and
with a question of indeterminate tightness in her chest and
no known murmur.  The catheterization showed 3 plus mitral
regurgitation, ejection fraction 20 percent, severe global
hypokinesis and normal coronaries with elevated filling
pressures.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bone spur removal.

Vaginal cyst removal in [**2095**].

Tubal ligation in ? [**2087**].

Periodontal surgery in ? [**2096**].

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to PENICILLIN and SULFA, both of
which give her hives, and PERCOCET, which gives her nausea
and vomiting.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO SURGERY:
1. Coreg 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Pepcid 30 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Nicotine 21 transdermal patch q.d.
6. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Levbid 0.375 p.o. b.i.d.


FAMILY HISTORY:  She lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 5165**] and 2
teenagers, and works part time.  She had a 45-pack-year
history of smoking and is a current smoker who only quit 5
days prior to her examination, for which she was seen
preoperatively by Cardiac Surgery on [**8-25**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is 5 feet 3 inches, weighs 146
pounds, blood pressure 94/62, heart rate between 80 and 106
with respiratory rate of 20, and saturating 97 percent on
room air.  She was sitting up in the chair in no apparent
distress, alert and oriented and very appropriate grossly,
with negative carotid bruits.  Her lungs were clear
bilaterally.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with S1,
S2 and a grade [**1-7**] holosystolic murmur best heard at the
apex.  Her abdomen was benign with positive bowel sounds.
Her extremities were warm, well perfused with no edema.  She
had 2 plus bilateral radial DP and PT pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.3, hematocrit 34.1, platelet
count 151,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, CO2
24, BUN 12, creatinine 0.7 and blood sugar of 91.  Her
urinalysis is negative.  ALT 54, AST 23, alkaline phosphatase
72, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 3.4.

Her chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions but was
otherwise unremarkable.  A preoperative EKG showed sinus
tachycardia with a left atrial abnormality and nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia up to 4 beats and couplets with a
possibility of an old anteroseptal infarct.  Please refer to
the cardiology EKG done on [**8-25**], read by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **].  The echocardiogram done on [**8-15**] showed
mild dilation of her left atrium, a low ejection fraction and
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis with 1 plus aortic
insufficiency and 4 plus mitral regurgitation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and came in
to the hospital on [**9-1**] for surgery where she
underwent a mitral valve repair with a 28-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
annuloplasty ring and a posterior leaflet cleft closure.  She
was transferred to the Cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition
on a dobutamine drip at 10 mcg/kg/minute, a Levophed drip,
which was being titrated off as the patient was being rolled
out of the room to the ICU, and finishing off a protamine
drip.  Postoperatively, in the CSRU later that evening, she
did appear to be struggling a bit and echocardiogram was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5543**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], which showed that
the mitral valve ring was well seeded, there was moderate
mitral regurgitation but no paravalvular mitral regurgitation
or mitral stenosis.  The left ventricle was dilated with an
unchanged ejection fraction. The right ventricle was dilated
and hypokinetic.  Please refer to the final report.  The
impression was severe left ventricle contractile dysfunction.

On postoperative day 1, her O2 saturations were down a little
bit and her index was sagging.  She was on amiodarone drip at
0.5 mg/minute, a dobutamine drip at 10 mcg/kg/min,
epinephrine at 0.2 mcg/kg/minute, a Levophed drip at 0.12
mcg/kg/minute, which was being titrated down that morning,
and an insulin drip at 1, and a lidocaine drip at 2.  She was
intubated and sedated with coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
Chest tubes remained in place.  Her abdomen was soft.  Her
extremities had no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Her
postoperative labs were potassium 4.6, BUN 17, creatinine
0.8, lactate 2.5, white count 19.6, hematocrit 37.4 with a
platelet count of 99,000 and an INR of 1.2.  The plan was to
try and wean down the dobutamine and lidocaine and also a
Heart Failure Service consult was obtained.  The patient also
had a Hematology consult for petechiae with a low platelet
count, as her platelets had gone from 157,000 to 99,000 on
[**9-2**] and then later that day were up to 119,000.  The
heparin was removed from all of her IVs per Hematology
recommendations.

On postoperative day 2, she was in sinus tachycardia at 101
with a blood pressure 117/64.  She was on amiodarone drip at
0.5, epinephrine drip at 0.125, insulin at 2.  Her index was
1.5.  She had been extubated and was on cool nebulizers.  Her
white count rose again to 24.3 with a hematocrit of 33.2,
which was stable, and a platelet count of 110,000 that
morning.  She was on 3 liters nasal cannula.  Epinephrine was
increased back up to 0.125 mcg/kg/minute and she started
Lasix at 40 IV b.i.d.  She continued to improve
hemodynamically over the day with no significant worsening of
her petechiae.  Her INR climbed to 1.5 and her platelets
dropped again to about 93,000.  Hematology continued to
consult on her daily and monitor her progress.  She was also
evaluated by Physical Therapy.

On postoperative day 3, she had her Lasix drip increased to
60 b.i.d.  Her epinephrine was discontinued, her lidocaine
was discontinued, although she did receive a lidocaine bolus
for premature ventricular contraction.  Her A-wires showed
she was in first-degree atrioventricular block.  She remained
on day 3 of Levaquin.  Her T-max was 101.7 with an index now
of 3.6 and a CO2 of 69 percent.  She was saturating 98
percent on 4 liters nasal cannula with no apparent distress.
Her lungs were clear except for occasional expiratory
wheezes.  Her abdomen was unremarkable.  Her femoral A-lines,
Swan and chest tubes were discontinued, so she could be out
of bed with physical therapy.  She was alert and oriented and
continued to improve dramatically.

On [**9-5**], her platelets were 226,000, her PT was 15.5,
her white count dropped to 16.6, hematocrit remained stable
at 33, and her creatinine was 0.8.  She continued to improve
and was seen on [**9-5**] also by Case Management to plan
for her discharge.

On postoperative day 5, she was in first-degree
atrioventricular block with a heart rate of 89, a blood
pressure 96/42, saturating 98 percent on 2 liters nasal
cannula now, with stable-like lab work.  She was on
amiodarone at 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. and Lasix 60 mg IV b.i.d.
and she remained on Levaquin for day 5.  She was also seen on
[**9-6**] by Cardiology.  She was HIT positive, please
refer to the Hematology consult note.  She was seen by the
CHS fellow.  Also, Hematology continued to make
recommendations.  She continued to work with Physical
Therapy.  On [**9-6**], postoperative day 5, she had no
events overnight, with a white count of 14.8 and hematocrit
of 32.9.  N
