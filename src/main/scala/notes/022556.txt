This is summary of [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from [**2179-2-11**] to
[**2179-2-19**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
multifactorial pulmonary disease on 4 liters home nasal
cannula oxygen who presents with a three day history of
increasing weakness and shortness of breath.  Two days prior
to admission VNA recorded blood pressure of 50/30 (normal
systolic blood pressure 80-90).  The patient was alert and
oriented with this blood pressure.  [**Name (NI) **] wife reports no
history of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough,
cough productive of white sputum.  In addition, patient has
sacral decubitus ulcer which has been improving.  The patient
was treated for left lower extremity toe cellulitis
approximately two weeks ago with course of Keflex.  Of note,
wife reports patients friends visited the patient three days
prior to admission and are known to give patient
Benzodiazepines and narcotics.

At hemodialysis the patient's systolic blood pressure was 82.
Blood pressure dropped to 77 and patient received 200 cc of
IV fluids with increase in systolic blood pressure to 85.
The patient was noted to be sedated and Narcan 0.8 mg was
given with some increase in responsiveness.  Blood cultures
and EKG were done and patient was given Vancomycin 1 gm and
Gentamycin 80 mg for empiric treatment of sepsis.

In the Emergency Room patient's temperature was 96.3, blood
pressure 96/61, sat 83% on room air.  The patient was poorly
responsive with blood pressure decreased to 60's.  Dopamine
was started at this time.  O2 sats at 100% non rebreather
mask decreased to the 80's and chest x-ray was obtained which
was consistent with CHF.  An additional Narcan 0.4 mg was
given with minimal effect.  ABG was obtained which showed
6.93/133/72 and patient was intubated for hypoxic hypercarbic
respiratory failure and Neo-Synephrine was started.  The
patient was then taken to the MICU.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**2179-2-11**] to [**2179-2-19**]: The patient is a
58-year-old male with AIDS, end stage renal disease on
hemodialysis, multifactorial pulmonary disease on home O2 use
with history of hypercarbic respiratory failure who presents
with three day history of increasing fatigue and shortness of
breath.  The patient was found to be in hypocarbic
respiratory failure with hypotension.  Differential diagnosis
on admission was sepsis vs overdose of Benzodiazepines or
narcotics.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient has long history of
multifactorial pulmonary disease including history of
pulmonary embolism and COPD, who presents with increasing
fatigue and shortness of breath.  In the Emergency Room,
patient's O2 sats decreased to 80's on 100% on rebreather.
ABG showed 6.93/133/72 on 100% non rebreather, consistent
with a primary respiratory acidosis with mild metabolic
acidosis.  The patient was subsequently intubated.  Etiology
o hypercarbic respiratory failure included overdose of
narcotics or Benzodiazepines causing decreased central drive
vs obstruction from infectious process.  The patient did have
a small response to administration of Narcan in the Emergency
Room.  The patient was subsequently extubated on hospital day
#2.  ABG done post extubation on four liters nasal cannula
showed PH 7.20, PCO2 60, PO2 65 which is thought to represent
patient's baseline pulmonary status.  Following extubation,
patient's O2 saturation remained stable on four liters of
nasal cannula oxygen which is patient's baseline O2
requirement.  Of note, patient is not taking any MDIs or
nebulizers for history of COPD, as patient states he does not
like the way they make him feel.  During this admission the
patient's Methadone was continued but other narcotics and
Benzodiazepines were initially held.  The patient was started
on Percocet one tablet po q 4 hours for pain.

2.  Infectious Disease:  Following intubation, patient spiked
a temperature to 101.6 associated with leukocytosis with
white count of 10.8.  In the Emergency Room the patient
became hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 60's
and patient was started on Vancomycin, Gentamycin and
Levaquin for empiric treatment of sepsis.  Blood cultures,
fungal cultures and AFB cultures drawn on admission all
showed no growth to date.  Sputum cultures grew MRSA and
chest x-ray showed bilateral lung opacities consistent with a
pneumonia.  Whether pneumonia was a primary event causing
respiratory failure or result of aspiration following
intubation is unclear.  On hospital day #2 Levaquin and
Gentamycin were discontinued and patient was kept on
Vancomycin for 14 day course of antibiotics for treatment of
MRSA pneumonia.

Of note, patient does have baseline productive cough which
slightly worsened during this admission.  The patient was
continued on Stavudine and Lamivudine for HIV.  In addition,
patient is on Bactrim DS one tablet three times a week for
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

3.  Cardiovascular:  Patient presents with history of HIV,
dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of 30-40% in [**2178-1-22**].  In
addition, patient has a history of VT in [**2178-10-24**] status
post ablation, now on Ami
