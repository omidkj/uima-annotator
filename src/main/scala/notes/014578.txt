Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, Tachycardia

PICC line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
A 82-year-old female with a history of recurrent large cutaneous
B-cell lymphoma in complete remission, CAD, AS, A-fib, who
presented to urgent care today for diarrhea and weakness and was
sent to the ED for tachcardia.  She started to feel unwell
around [**2170-3-29**].  She developed shortness of breath, rhinorrhea,
post nasal drip and cough.  Her temp was 100.5 and given her
cough she was thought to have a bacterial infection and was
given augmentin 10 day course, and 4 day course of prednisone
40mg daily.  She was seen one days later ([**3-30**]) and reported
improvement of her symptoms.
.
She completed her prednisone but while on the augmentin she
developed 3-4 episodes of diarrhea per day.  It was non-bloody,
but did contain mucous.  She had associated cramping. She
reports poor po intake over this time.  No chest pain, Shortness
of breath.  No vomiting.  Positive urge to deficate after
eaeting.
.
Of note her she has chronic PAF, on coumadin, s/p cardioversion
in [**2152**].  Rate/rhythm control previously on procainamide, dig,
atenolol -> now on dig, atenolol, still primarily in sinus, with
occ runs of afib. Of note in [**2168**] atenolol was attempted to be
reduced to 37.5 and amlodipine was added at 2.5mg.  This was
done to try to decrease raynaud's.  At that time her dig level
was noted to be high and that dose was decreased (to 125 from
250).  This caused her to have symptoms of lightheadedness and a
holter revealed runs of A-tach (question flutter).  Discussion
with cardiology at that time led to increasing atenolol and
stopping the amlodipine.   It appears however that she did not
increase the atenolol.  As of [**Month (only) **] in [**2168**] her atenolol had not
been increased, and per discussion with cards at that time, PCP
increased to atenolol 50mg daily.
.
Of note patient reports she accidentially took her coumadain on
morning of admit, she normally takes it in afternoon.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were:  96.2 148 104/80 18 90% 2L
L.  Her exam was significant for tachycardia.  A chest X-ray
showed "Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement with mild right
basilar atelectasis".  A CT of the abdomen showed diffuse
colitis.   Her abdominal exam was benign so surgery was not
consulted. but because of concern for C. diff she was given IV
flagyl.  She was found to in A-fib.  She was given 4L of normal
saline based on her tachycardia as well as her history of
diarrhea.  After 4L of NS her lactate was 5.7.  She was given
dilt 15mg x2 without much improvement in her heart rate.

On transfer vital signs were: 97.4 128 112/90 20 99Ra 18:45 VS
97.4 R -138-112/90-20-99% RA.
