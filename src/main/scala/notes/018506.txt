Pertinent Results:
[**2143-7-30**] Cardiac Cath:
Right Lower Extremity: The previously described right popliteal
occlusion was moderately improved with reduction in the thrombus
in the proximal popliteal with a funnel shaped occlusion at the
takeoff of the AT.  Very little flow could be seen to the foot
via the popliteal.  The PFA supplied collaterals filling the
peroneal vessel but the AT and PT were presumable occluded with
thrombus.  An 0.014" wire was directed into the distal popliteal
but intraluminal position in the AT could not be obtained and
only entry of an accessory vessel could be made.  The wire was
redirected into a high-takeoff PT/accessory popliteal artery
which was occluded at the knee.  The wire passed into what
appeared to be a small PT vessel that filled to the distal calf.

A 2.0 mm balloon was used to dilate and restore flow into the
vessel.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7336**] wire was then directed into the true popliteal
and an additional course of tPA was planned.

[**2143-7-30**] Cardiac Cath (2nd of the day):
The previously imaged popliteal artery no longer had flow in the
portion of the popliteal collateralizing the PT.  The popliteal
was now occluded at the knee while flow was previously noted to
below the knee.  Profunda collaterals, however, were seen to
fill
the peroneal artery more proximally than previously noted.

[**2143-7-30**] Cardiac Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No ASD or left ventricular thrombus seen. Normal
global and regional biventricular systolic function.

[**2143-7-30**] Vein mapping
VENOUS STUDY

HISTORY:  Right popliteal artery occlusion, vein mapping.

FINDINGS:  The greater saphenous veins are patent bilaterally,
see digitized image on PACS for sequential measurements.

[**2143-7-30**]  arterial duplex
ARTERIAL STUDY.

HISTORY:  Right popliteal occlusion, now on TPA.

FINDINGS:  Limited portable assessment of the popliteal artery
on the right was performed.  There is patency of the right
popliteal artery, though velocities are low.  Some residual
thrombus versus plaque marginating the arterial walls is
appreciated.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o M with history of hodkins lymphoma s/p chemotheraphy now
in remission for 10 years, crohn's disease who presented to his
PCP with right calf claudication and found to have right
popiteal artery occulsion that was complicated by compartment
syndrome.

Right Popiteal Occulsion: The patient had several weeks of right
lower extermity pain of several weeks which prompted an ABI that
showed 0.65 on the right with monophasic arterial wave forms
from the right popliteal distally. He was taken to the cardiac
cath lab on [**2143-7-29**] and found to have a right popiteal artery
blockage. The interventional team was unable to pass the wire. A
TPA drip and heparin was started and he was admitted to the CCU
for observation. He was taken back the the cardiac cath lab on
HD#2 and continued to have the obstruction. He was maintained on
TPA and heparin throughout the day but was noted to have
increasing pain and swelling of his right lower extermity. He
was taken back the cath lab where it was noted the obstruction
was still in place but there was no bleeding seen.

Right lower extermity compartment syndrome: Pt was brought to
the endovascular suite for evacuation of hematoma and
fasciotomies. He tolerated this procedure well and was recovered
in the ICU without signigficant difficulty. The following day he
was transfered to the VICU and then to the floor.

His lateral fasciotomy was closed on post op day # 2.  The
medial fascitomy was Closed on POD #3. His diet was advanced as
appropriate and he was seen by PT. At the time of discharge his
pain was well controlled and he was tollerating a regular diet.
He was discharged on POD #4 with follow up scheduled for [**2143-8-19**]
