CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Question of seizures.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old
mostly Spanish-speaking male with a history of end-stage
renal disease on hemodialysis, diabetes, coronary artery
disease, multiple line infections, recent presumed osteo of
cervical spine, who presents from an outside hospital for a
question of seizure.

The patient was feeling poorly on the morning of admission as
well as at hemodialysis, complaining of increasing shortness
of breath as well as shaking of the upper extremities which
was interpreted as a possible seizure activity.  The patient
was given Ativan and Dilantin loading, and was intubated for
airway protection.  Head CT was negative for a mass or bleed.
The patient's wife states that he was not himself in the
morning, being tachypneic and confused.  In addition, she
feels that his head and neck have significantly swollen up.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any tobacco or alcohol
use.  He lives at home with his wife, but has recently been
in rehabilitation since his last hospitalization in [**2145-10-15**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.5, pulse
73, blood pressure 140/50, respiratory rate 12, 02 saturation
100% on room air.  In general, the patient was sedated,
intubated.  HEENT examination revealed that the pupils were
minimally reactive, anicteric, significant facial/periorbital
edema, ET tube in place.  The neck was supple.  The lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1,
S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  The
extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Left AV
fistula with positive thrill.  Neurologically, the patient
was sedated, but withdraws with legs to noxious stimuli.
Deep tendon reflexes could not be elicited.  Positive
Babinski bilaterally, positive corneal reflex and gag reflex,
normal muscle tone.

LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER: White count 4.2, hematocrit
26.7, platelets 333,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 6.0, chloride
96, bicarbonate 27, BUN 83, creatinine 8.4, glucose 41.  PT
21, PTT 57, INR 2.8, ALT 6, AST 17, CK 57, troponin less than
0.3, alkaline phosphatase 108, total bilirubin 0.2.  ABGs
7.59/30/519, lactate 2.4.

The head CT was negative for bleed.

The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats per
minute, normal axis, normal intervals, new T wave inversions
in V4 through V6, no peak Ts, no ST elevations or
depressions, no Q waves.  No significant changes from
[**2145-11-14**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 63-year-old mostly
Spanish-speaking male with a history of end-stage renal
disease on hemodialysis who presents with a question of
seizures, intubated, now transferred to the floor with
probable SVC syndrome and access issues.

1.  NEUROLOGY:  It is unlikely that the patient ever had a
seizure.  During this episode, trembling, the patient was
noted to have a fingerstick of 36.  In addition, he was
continually talking through the rhythmic motions.  It is much
more likely that the patient was simply having symptomatic
hypoglycemia.  The patient was intubated after receiving
loading doses of Ativan and Dilantin.  His head CT was
negative, and his MRI was negative for bleed but showed only
old bilateral lacunar disease.  No lumbar puncture was
performed because of a low index of suspicion for infectious
sources of mental status changes.  The patient continued to
be delirious, especially at night.  However, as the Ativan
came out of his system, he became less delirious and more
oriented.  He was continued on olanzapine 5 mg p.o. q.d.

At this time, there still is an EEG pending from [**Hospital3 16786**] from which he was transferred.  However, given the
low likelihood for seizure activity, this may not need to be
further followed.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has known right and left-sided
upper extremity clots, and as of [**2145-11-3**], had 40%
occlusion of the SVC.  The patient was admitted on Coumadin.
This was held and the patient was started on heparin.  Given
the new upper torso pitting edema and concern for SVC, it is
probable that some of these clots have migrated into the path
of the SVC.  The patient was also sent for hypercoagulability
workup.  Many of these results are still pending.  The
patient was noted to have a protein S deficiency, but this
may not be significant in the presence of active clotting.

On [**2145-11-25**], the patient received an ultrasound vein mapping.
This showed the presence of only left-sided internal jugular
clots.  However, the SVC could not be assessed.  The plan at
this point is to visualize the upper torso venous system
through angiography while performing a fistulogram.  This is
scheduled for [**2145-11-29**].  For now, the patient is maintained
on a heparin drip.

3.  ACCESS:  On admission, the patient had an old left EJ
versus subclavian that was inserted on this past admission
about two weeks ago.  This line is used for temporary
dialysis.  The patient also has a right midline catheter that
was used for infusion of IV Oxacillin.  However, this was
found to be nonfunctioning.  The patient received a left
femoral central line for both Oxacillin and heparin infusion.
The patient also has a left AV fistula with positive thrill,
however, poor blood flow was noted during hemodialysis on
[**2145-11-24**].  The patient is status post fistulogram
and angioplasty of that same AV fistula about a week and a
half ago.

As already noted, the patient is scheduled for an AV
fistulogram on [**2145-11-29**].  If this is found to be operational,
the left EJ versus the subclavian line should be taken out,
especially as the patient has been spiking fevers.  If AV
fistula is not viable, Transplant Surgery will need to
reassess the fistula, and a temporary Perma-Cath will need to
be placed.  From past admissions, the patient is a big access
problem, and placement of even a [**Name (NI) 34028**] will be very
difficult in this patient.  The right midline catheter was
removed on [**2145-11-27**].

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient is currently being
treated for presumed osteomyelitis in the setting of MSSA
bacteremia that was noted on past admissions.  He is
receiving Oxacillin IV, 1 gram q. four hours.  This is to be
continued through [**2145-12-13**].

Of note, the patient started spiking again on this admission,
up to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.  All of the patient's blood
cultures have been negative.  The patient is essentially
anuric.  His chest x-ray initially indicated the presence of
opacity, but the final read was read as atelectasis.  The
patient was initially placed on le
