chronic pain on narcotics, recent TKA on [**2174-5-19**] complicated by
two subsequent hospitalizations for erythema and drainage of the
wound who presents to the ED with AMS and hypoxia. Following his
TKA he was placed on lovenox for 4 weeks to be followed by full
dose asa for 3 weeks. He was readmitted on [**5-26**] for erythema and
pain and given IV antibiotics.  Cultures never showed any growth
and he was given keflex for prophylaxis.  He was readmitted on
[**2174-6-8**] for a small area of dehiscence and again was initially
given IV abx until cultures were negative and was then

90s and improved to 120s after 2 L IVF.  Head CT was normal. CXR
was obtained which was read as possible atalectasis followed by
CTA that showed pulmonary embolus in left upper lobe segmental
branch with b/l patchy opacity likely atelectasis, but cant
exclude aspiration. He was given cefipime, vancomycin, and
levofloxacin. Sputum cx was not obtained. He was also started on
heparin gtt. He was placed on nonrebreather 100% and his sats
improved to 90%. He was transferred to the ICU for oxygen

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13100**] is a 48M with a PMH s/f HIV (last CD4 > 800),
chronic pain on narcotics, recent TKA who presents to the ED p/w
AMS and hypoxia. Now found to have a PE.
.
.
#Hypoxia - Patient was found to be hypoxic in the ED. This could
best be explained by a PNA or PE. A CXR was c/w atelectasis and
a CT-A shouwed evidence of PE, with question of aspiration. In
the absence of a reported or suspected aspiration event and
afebrile status aspiration PNA is unlikely. However, he does
have an elevated WBC count and slight left shift at 78%N
possibly consistent with CAP. He was started on Levofloxacin and
continued to be afebrile. Blood cultures and urine
culturesnegative.
He was titrated on Heparin to therapeutic levels and continued
on Lovenox bridge to coumadin for tx of PE. Pt was no longer
hypoxic at time of
