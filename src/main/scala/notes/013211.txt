History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old female with CAD, HTN,
hypercholesteremia who presents this a.m. with shortness of
breath.  Patient has short term memory loss and is a difficult
historian, and family is not present, so majority of HPI
obtained from OMR and ED notes.  Patient's SOB developed on
[**11-24**], accompanied by tachypnea and increased work of breathing.
 Per family, patient is noncompliant with meds.  Also has had
productive cough of white-green sputum for multiple days, no
fevers.  EMS called this a.m. and on transit patient found to be
hypertensive to 198/102, tachy to 104, tachypneic to 38 and 100%
on NRB.  Recieved 40 IV lasix, Sl nitro, and nebs with slight
improvement.
.
Upon arrival to ED vitals were 268/110, 108, 19, 98% RA.  Nitro
gtt was started for hypertensive urgency, and pt was treated
with ASA x 1, hydralazine prn, albuterol and ipratroprium nebs x
3, solumedrol 40 IV x 1 with improvement in respiratory status.
However, nitro was stopped d/t SBP in 90's and 500 cc of NS was
given.  Had also been placed on BIPAP for respiratory distress
(92% and tachypnic) but this was also stopped d/t hypotension.
Blood pressure recovered and then she again became hypertensive
to SBP 190's, at which time nitro was [**Last Name (un) 7162**] restarted but stopped
when ED decided to resume BIPAP instead because patient looked
uncomfortable.  CXR was done without evidence of infiltrate or
CHF, although pro-BNP elevated.  EKG with sinus tachycardia -
faxed to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] who read it as LVF with strain and cardiac
enzymes were sent.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient stated that she was
anxious from the transport and mildly diaphoretic but not SOB.
No chest pain, jaw pain, LE swelling, orthopnea, PND, fevers,
sore throat. + occasional cough (can't specify).  No HA, vision
changes, nausea, vomiting, back pain.

EKG:  sinus tachycardia with PVC'c, nml axis, nml intervals, LVH
with associated ST changes
.
CXR [**2117-11-25**]: Hyperexpansion and slight flattening of both
diaphragms consistent with emphysema.  Dual lead pacemaker
noted.  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged.
No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax. Lungs are clear.  Osseous
structures are unchanged.  Left hemidiaphragm ? right, no
widened mediastinum.
.
CTA CHEST [**2117-11-25**]: 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
Limited evaluation for subsegmental
branchies in the lower lobes due to motion.  Atherosclerotic and
tortuous
aorta with calcified and noncalcified plaques, however, no
evidence of
dissection.
2.  Centrilobular emphysema.
3.  Peribronchial thickening in bilateral lower lobes, with
increased patchy opacities in the right lower lobe, worrisome
for infectious or inflammatory process in this area.
.
TTE [**2117-11-26**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2115-10-23**], left ventricular hypertrophy is now more prominent.

.
CT HEAD [**2117-11-26**]: No evidence of acute intracranial pathology
including no sign of hemorrhage.
.
.
[**2117-12-1**] TTE - pending.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred to the MICU in respiratory distress felt
secondary to hypertensive emergency.
.
# respiratory distress -  ProBNP was elevated on admission, and
patient with known CAD, LVH, was felt to have had pulmonary
edema in setting of hypertensive urgency leading to hypoxia.
Patient with known COPD, hyperinflated lungs on CXR, markedly
wheezy on initial exam, with minimal response to inhalers,
suggestive of possible COPD exacerbation.  On admission to MICU
she was initially managed with mask ventilation, but soon after
admission became increasingly tachypneic and was intubated.  Pt
also presnted with cough and leukocytosis, thus pneumoinia was
and pt treated with azithromycin, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, but
discontinued on day 2.  She r
