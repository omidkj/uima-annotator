Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty speaking

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16968**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a history of breast CA
(s/p surgery and rads in [**2138**]'s) and HTN who presented to the ER
at 10:00PM after her daughter found her unable to speak tonight.
She has apparently been ill for the last week/week and a half
with URI symptoms (rhinorrhea, cough); she also had nausea
several days ago. Other than these symptoms, she had been well.
Her daughter, who was on her way to the patient's house, called
the patient at 8:30 PM when she noticed that her mother was not
able to speak. She was grunting a bit, but not saying words. The
daughter says that she spoke with her mother last night, at
9:30PM, when she seemed to be normal. Knowing that something was
wrong, her daughter immediately went to the patient's home where
she found her sitting on the couch with a "dazed" look on her
face. She was not able to speak, but
appeared to comprehend well. Occasionally, she would try to
speak, but was unable to produce words. This continued and has
not significantly improved over the last several hours. The
daughter did not notice any facial droop, weakness, or
difficulty with gait. The patient herself denies visual symptoms
(blurred
vision, diplopia), dysphagia, weakness or numbness. Since
finding her mother aphasic tonight, her daughter has
subsequently discovered that a neighbor had been concerned about
the patient's well being earlier today and had called the police
to check on her. The cause of this neighbor's concern is not
known. The police apparently did come to her appartment around
6:00 tonight and thought that she appeared well. They left
without contacting the neighbor or family members.
On review of systems, she denies fever/chills. She denies SOB,
CP, abdominal pain, or dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to stoke service. MRI showed L insular ischemic
stroke. EKG showed atrial flutter/fibrillation. Following
diltiazem drip, metroprolol and digoxin, pt returned to sinus
rhythm. As per cardiology recommendations, amiodarone was
started for rhythm maintainence. Baseline PFTs, TSH, and LFTs
were ordered (re: amiodarone). ASA, statin, and heparin were
started. Pt was scheduled for cardiac echo. The pt's
speech/aphasia slowly improved over the course of her stay. ACEI
was started for BP control. Coumadin was started and INR became
therapeutic; heparin was d/c'd. Following evaluation by SLP, PT,
and OT, it was felt that an inpatient rehab setting would be
most appropriate, especially given her residual aphasias (still
evolving throughout course, and as of [**2154-2-19**]).  [**2154-2-20**]
Transthoracic Cardiac echo showed EF 60% and no evidence of
thrombus.  Coumadin has been lowered to 3.0 based on INR 1.1
[**2-18**] --> 2.6 on [**2-20**].
