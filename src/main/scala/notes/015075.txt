[**2158-5-13**] ECHO
The left ventricle is not well seen. There is a moderate-sized
vegetation on the leftr coronary cusp of the aortic valve. The
non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve appears to be disrupted
and its attachment may have separated from the aortic annulus.
There is an abscess cavity that appears to extend from the non
coronary cusp through the aortic-mitral fibrous continuity and
into the middle anterior scallop of the mitral valve. The
anterior and posterior scallops do not appear involved in this
abscess. The aortic annulus is thickened near the non and left
coronary cusps. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is an abscess cavity seen adjacent to the mitral valve (in
continuity with the non coronary cusp of the aortic valve.) An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade
may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.


IMPRESSION: Aortic annular abscess that is probably extending
from the non coronary cusp into the middle scallop of the mitral
valve. There does not appear to be a vegetation or perforation
of the mitral valve leaflets. There is also a vegetation on the
left coronary cusp of the aortic valve. Severe aortic
regurgitation and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation are
seen. Small to moderate pericardial effusion that appears to
track with gravity. Most of the effusion is thus posterior to
the heart. There is right atrial diastolic collapse but no frank
tamponade (elevated right sided pressures may mask
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.)

[**2158-5-13**] ECHO
Prebypass

1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There is a moderate-sized vegetation on the aortic valve-
left coronary cusp. An aortic annular abscess is seen extending
to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. There is a Moderate
to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a
communication between the aortic root and the left atrium.
5.There is a moderate-sized vegetation on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a large pericardial effusion.
7. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2158-5-13**]
at 1430.

Post Bypass
1. Biventricular systolic function is slightly depressed. LVEF=
45%
2. Mechanical valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets move
well and the valve appears well seated. ( 21mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]). Mean
gradient across the valve is 20 mm Hg. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] aware.
3. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with a posteriorly
directly jet present.
4. Post surgical changes with pledgets and sutures seen on the
left atrial side near the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve.
( Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] informed)
5. Aorta intact post decannulation

[**2158-5-15**] CT Scan
1. Small postoperative substernal fluid collection as well as
moderate pericardial effusion, both of which demonstrate
peripheral rim enhancement. Although these findings may be seen
in the setting of recent postoperative state, a superimposed
infection cannot be excluded.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis
(right greater than left).
3. Prior right lower lobe lobectomy.
4. Small bilateral patchy opacities in both lungs which may be
infectious or inflammatory in origin or may represent
atelectatic foci.
5. Mild splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the CCU. TEE confirmed vegetation on AV and
severe AI, moderate to severe MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was taken urgently to the
operating room on [**5-13**] where he underwent an AVR and mitral
valve reconstruction with pericardial patch.  He was transferred
to the ICU in stable condition. He  was extubated post op. He
was seen by infectious diseases and continued on vancomycin. He
was seen by pain medicine and started on methadone, baclofen and
clonidine with dilaudid for breakthrough. He was transferred to
the floor on POD #2. He was started on coumadin for his
mechanical valve. He was seen by addiction services. On [**2158-5-18**]
a generalized erythematous, maculopapular rash developed. Lasix
was discontinued due to possible sulfa cross reactivity. The
infectious disease and dermatology services were consulted.
Punch biopsies as well as viral specs were sent to pathology
which were negative. It was suspected that the rash was related
to either the lasix or vancomycin. Bumex was thus used for
diuresis and vancomycin was replaced with daptomycin for
treatment of his MRSA aortic valve endocarditis. The remainder
of his postoperative course remained uneventful. He continued
anticoagulation for his mechanical aortic valve with a goal INR
of 2.5-3.0. His coumadin dosing will be managed by the [**Hospital **]
rehabilitation center while a resident there followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 62081**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 78575**] of [**Hospital6 **] System.
Social worker, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], is working on obtaining a primary
care physician for Mr. [**Known lastname **]. Daptomycin will be continued
until [**2158-6-23**]. He will need weekly CBC's with differentials,
chemistry 7, liver function studies and CPK's while taking
daptomycin. He will follow-up with the [**Hospital1 **] ID service. Mr.
[**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress and was discharged to
the [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility on [**2158-5-25**]. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 month.
