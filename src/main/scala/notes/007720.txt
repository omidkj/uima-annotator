HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year-old
male with a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
history of SBL, question of Crohn's disease with an ETOH
history who initially presented from the outside hospital
with jarring and tearing abdominal pain with radiation to the
back and hypotension from 68/30 to 38/palp.  He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**10-20**] when he was fluid resuscitated with good response, given
3 units of fresh frozen platelets, 1 unit of packed red blood
cells.  He had an abdominal CT, which revealed subcapsular
liver hematoma and was guaiac positive.  He was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit.  Initially white blood cell count
was 21.6, hematocrit was 29.7, INR 1.8, creatinine 1.7 with
normal liver function tests.  The patient was intubated on
[**2173-10-21**] and had a liver angiogram, because the CT with
contrast revealed multiple liver masses and a cirrhotic liver
with the largest mass bleeding.  The patient received
chemo embolization of two branches of the left hepatic artery
as well as coiling.  A left subclavian was placed on [**10-21**] and
then changed over a wire on [**10-24**].  The patient's hematocrit
post procedure was noted to drop from 29.7 to 22.8.  He
received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells, 4
bags of platelets, 1 cryo, 17 units of fresh frozen platelets
between [**10-20**] and [**10-21**].  The patient's blood cultures were
positive for one out of four bottles of coag negative staph.
The patient began to spike on [**10-22**] to a max of 102.6.  He
grew out gram negative rods consistent with E-coli in his
sputum on [**10-22**] and was started on Zosyn and then was changed
to Levo.  The patient also had an elevated sodium to a max of
157 on [**10-25**].  A right subclavian was placed on [**10-26**].  Repeat
CT on [**10-27**] revealed no abscess, but revealed an interval
increase in ascites and multiple liver masses.  The patient's
antibiotics were then changed to Vancomycin and Zosyn based
on MRSA positive sputum on [**8-16**] and [**10-27**].  Antibiotics
were then changed to Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl on
[**10-26**].

patient was jaundice diffusely including under tongue.  He
was intubated.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cirrhosis:  Throughout his
hospitalization the patient had elevated transaminases.
Additionally his liver parenchymal was consistent with
cirrhosis.  The patient had continued ascites throughout his
hospitalization.  Paracentesis was performed and was
consistent with a transudate.  Additionally it was not
significant for an SBP.  During his hospitalization there was
concern regarding possible compartment syndrome based on the
fact that the patient's ascites would continue to grow.  The
patient had decreased urine output.  However, a bladder
pressure was obtained, which ruled out compartment syndrome.
Hepatology was following and felt that repeated paracentesis
was indicated only should the patient have pulmonary
compromise.  However, the patient remained stable on room air
and then on oxygen by nasal cannula, hence a repeat
paracentesis was not performed.  The patient's cytology and
pathology results was consistent with hepatoma.  Given that
his disease was so diffuse with multiple hepatic masses and
most likely seeding in his abdomen the family decided that
they did not want to initiate any chemotherapy at the current
time.  Hep serologies remained negative.

2.  The patient had persistent fevers initially.  The
differential diagnoses include MRSA, pneumonia, E-coli,
necrotizing hepatic masses, ischemic bowel, SBP, diarrhea,
endocarditis, deep venous thrombosis, PE, drug fever given
that the patient was on Zosyn and has a Penicillin allergy,
Atelectasis, endocarditis, DVT and PE were all ruled out.
SBP was ruled out based on peritoneal fluid analysis and the
patient's fever curb trended down.  It was felt secondary to
heavy tumor burden and consistent with patient metastatic
cancer.  Pan cultures were obtained, however, and remained
negative except for those mentioned above.

3.  Cardiovascular:  The patient did have episodes of a
supraventricular tachycardia, however, remained asymptomatic
during these episodes.  He had multiple rule out protocols
performed and ruled out for myocardial infarction on repeated
occasions.

4.  Acute renal failure:  The patient had acute on chronic
worsening of his renal failure, but with hydration his
creatinine normalized to the baseline of 1.3.  Additionally
his hyponatremia improved with free water boluses.

5.  FEN:  The patient was maintained on tube feeds.

6.  Lines:  The patient had a peripheral as well as .......
in his left upper extremity.

7.  Communication:  With his wife.  After having extensive
discussions with the wife it was decided that the patient
should be made DNR/DNI and then later the patient was made
comfort measures only.  This was due to the fact that the
patient had widely metastatic carcinoma with mets to the
liver and most likely peritoneal seating with an increase in
his ascites.  By the time of transfer to the MICU to the
General Medicine Floor the patient again had elevated sodiums
up to 152.  These were managed with free water boluses,
otherwise the patient's ascites continued to increase.
However, he remained stable on 2 liters of oxygen.  His
family did not reparacentesis.  They felt that the patient
should be transitioned into hospice care.  A hospice bed
could not be foun
