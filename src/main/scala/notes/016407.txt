Pertinent Results:
[**2117-7-17**]
CXR and pelvis XRay
1.  Multiple right rib fractures, with associated subcutaneous
emphysema, and opacity along the right chest [**Known lastname **] which may
represent extrapleural fluid versus hematoma.

2.  Asymmetrically increased right lung opacity likely
represents layering right pleural fluid, likely hemothorax given
associated trauma.

3.  Suggestion of loss of height of the L4 vertebral body.

[**2117-7-17**]
CT C/A/P
1. small right-sided hydropneumothorax predominating at the
right base with high-density fluid likely representing a
component of hematoma
2. Right-sided subcutaneous emphysema associated with rib
fractures
3. large right retroperitoneal hematoma
4. fractures of the transverse processes of T1 and L5 through
L1
5. multiple rib fractures bilaterally including ribs 6 through 9
on
the left and ribs 2 through 12 on the right
6. left scapula is fractured in multiple sites
7. multilevel degenerative disc changes are seen throughout the
thoracic and lumbar spine with multiulever compression
deformities of unknown chronicity
8. subtle craniocaudad linear lucency of the L5 vertebral body
which likely represents an acute fracture.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented with a mild oral and moderate pharyngeal
dysphagia resulting in aspiration of liquids and solids and in
significant amounts of pharyngeal residue. The deficits seen
were somewhat concerning for a neurological condition, as they
are not completely consistent with deconditioning, although no
significant delay was seen in swallow initiation. The pt may
also have an impairment of the vocal cords, but this could not
be assessed today as the pt went into V tach and the study had
to be cut short.

The pt will need to remain strictly NPO, including medications
and will either need to have an NG or [**Known lastname 282**] placed. We will wait
until the pt is better able to manage his [**Known lastname **] before we
repeat his swallow evaluation. It is also recommended he been
seen by ENT and consider a repeat scan if there are any other
changes /signs to suggest a neurological event.

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 1, not safe for any POs.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Suggest the pt remain strictly NPO including all medications.


2. Place NG tube or [**Known lastname 282**] tube for alternate means of nutrition,
hydration and medication.

3. Recommend ENT consult to evaluate vocal cord closure.

4. Consider repeat head CT if there are any other changes /
signs
to suggest a neurological event.

5. Please reconsult when the pt's MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] have
cleared.

Brief Hospital Course:
After initial trauma evaluation the patient was admitted to the
trauma ICU.

Neuro: Neurosurgery was cosulted and recommended conservative
treatment, no neurosurgery needed, LSO as needed for comfort.
Follow-up in clinic in [**3-5**] weeks. Pt's pain was controlled on an
epidural. He was gradually transitioned to p.o. pain meds. He
was treated with methadone 3x daily and haldol prn.

CV: Pt was tachycardic in the ICU. His tachycardia was
controlled with beta blockers.

Resp: Initially intubated and admitted to ICU. He was gradually
weaned off the vent and extubated.

GI: ENT was consulted and recommended starting PPI at [**Hospital1 **] dosing
to minimize laryngopharyngeal reflux, safe diet recommendations
per speech and swallow, and
follow up to repeat [**Hospital1 **] in [**1-31**] weeks to evaluate for
resolution of mass, improvement of erythema.

GU: After adequate fluid resuscitation the patient was diuresed
with lasix. He had no significant GU issues during his hospital
course.

FEN: Pt was maintained on tube feeds. Formal swallow evaluation
demonstrated dysphagia and a recommendation to maintain the pt
NPO was made.  In order to maintain the pt on longer-term tube
feeds the pt underwent a [**Date Range 282**] tube placement on [**2117-7-28**].

Endo: Pt's blood sugars were controlled on an insulin sliding
scale.

ID: Pt's sputum grew H. flu and S. pneumo sensitive to levo. Pt
was treated with an 8 day course of levofloxacin. Zosyn was
added to the regimen on HD14 (POD2 after [**Date Range 282**] tube placement),
and the pt received a total of 3 days of Zosyn before it was
d/c'ed.

Heme: Pt developed a stable anemia which was followed
clinically.
