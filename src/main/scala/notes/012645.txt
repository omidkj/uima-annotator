Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Cefepime

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Renal Failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
 On a prior admission, pt admitted w/ STEMI that was thought to
have occurred 3-4 days prior admission. Because of timing, pt
did not undergo stenting during cardiac cath, which showed.
Following cath, she developed cardiogenic shock, for which she
was temporarily treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump,
levophed and milrinone. She was eventually weaned off all these.
She was started on aspirin, atorvastatin and digoxin. (She had
been on OCPs on admission which were dc'd). TTE from [**2147-3-8**]
showed an EF of 25% with septal, anterior and apical akinesis. A
repeat TTE was performed on [**2147-3-16**] to assess for interval
improvement, but there was no change in cardiac function. Pt
also had low-grade fevers throughout her hospitalization. Prior
to last admission, she was treated with a full course of
ciprofloxacin for a UTI. All blood cultures were negative and UA
negative. She was put on a five day course of vancomycin
empirically for possible line infection (it was thought that she
may have had transient bacteremia from the catherization
instrumentation, even thought cultures were negative). She was
also given a five day course of azithromycin for a possible
community acquired PNA given a LUL infiltrate on CXR. Despite
the course of azithromycin, her fevers persisted and there was
worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity. She was started on a
seven day course of IV cefepime and vancomycin for hospital
acquired pneumonia. A PICC line was placed in the left arm on
[**2147-3-18**] for out-patient administration of IV antibiotics.
During her stay, there was also concern for antiphospholipid
antibody syndrome, given her MI at a young age, with few cardiac
risk factors and given elevated PTT. Testing for
antiphospholipid antibodies was deferred in the in-patient
setting because of possible false positive results with acute
illness and anticoagulation.
.
Since discharge, the patient has reportedly continued to have
low grade fevers at [**Hospital1 **]. She had a R PICC line placed on
[**2147-3-23**] (unclear indication for placement). [**Name8 (MD) **] Crt has slowly
trended up over the past 7 days. The pt reportedly maintained
normal PO intake. She had low urine output and reportedly 25cc
on bladder scan. Her Hct dropped from 31.3 (on [**3-22**]) to 25.3 (on
[**3-28**]). Her SBP at rehab ranged from high 80s-110s--she was in
the 90s on discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] according to notes available.
She then developed a rash--total body--on the day of
presentation.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt. was febrile to 101.6, HR 100, BP 91/45, 19, 100 on
2L. A pelvic exam was negative for foreign bodies. Renal US
showed no hydro. She was given tylenol, vanc, ceftaz and
ceftrioxone and 300cc of NS.

.
On admission patient denied pain or compliants, otherwise does
not answer questions of verbally interact.

Studies:
.
Renal Ultrasound
FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 10.2 cm.  The left kidney
measures 10.5 cm.  There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or
stones.  There are no perinephric fluid collections.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones
.
Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely
depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis
of the septum and apex, and hypokinesis of the anterior free
wall. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical
free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2147-3-16**], the heart rate is increased; otherwise the
findings are similar.
.
Chest Xray
FINDINGS:  In the interim, the pulmonary edema has reappeared.
The heart is persistently enlarged.  No pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Reappearance of pulmonary edema with no focal areas to
suggest pneumonia.
2.  Persistent cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, renal consult was obtained and the patient became
hypotensive on the floor.  She was transfered to the ICU when
her BPs were not fluid responsive.  An aline was placed in the
ICU which registered BPs that were 15 points higher than those
noted on the cuff.  She was transiently put on dopamine but
quickly weaned.  She was noted to have positive Cdiff and
started on IV flagyl.  Per report of micu team, she is not
taking oral meds at this time because of a distrust of MDs.  BP
stabilized and pt was transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor the pt became dyspneic with O2 sat drops to the
high 70s/low 80s, which responede to 70% facemask with O2 sats
in the low 90s.  CXR showed pulm edema.  Pt was diuresed with
resolution of dyspnea.  Soon after diuresis pt became
hypotensive with SBP in the 80s but no symptoms.  Pt was fluid
bolused and then became more dyspneic with repeat CXR showing
worsenign pulm edema.  Because of this tenuous fluid balance
decision was made only to bolus IVF for SBP<80 or for symptoms.
With these new criterea pt stabilized and was able to come off
supplemental O2 with O2 sats 94-96% on RA.  BP also stabilized.
When SBP rose to 100-105 pt was restarted on Beta Blocker and
ACEI.
.
As pt's hemodynamic and resp status improved she continued to
refuse PO meds, and when she would eat she would gag and vomit.
Initially the etiology of this was unclear.  Pt was transintly
supported on TPN, S&S eval ws unable to find a cause for
dysphagia.  GI was consulted, and they preformed an EGD which
showed an non-obstructive Schotsky's ring, which was dilated.
Despite this intervention dysphagia continued.  Pt's caretaker,
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4223**], came in to visit and reported that pt is a very
picky eater
