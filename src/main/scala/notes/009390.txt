Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with 1 stent placed


History of Present Illness:
81 yo with a history of CAD who presented to an OSH today with
chest pain. The patient reports that he started to experience
chest pain about three days ago associated with shortness of
breath. The pain came on after he worked on an iron stove for a
couple of hours. The chest pain was associated with ambulation.
However this morning at about 3am he started to have chest pain
at rest associated with more severe shortness of breath. He went
to [**Hospital3 7569**] where he was found to be in pulmonary edema
with a SBP of 80-90 and O2 Sats in the low 80s. He was given
Lasx iv 10mg and was transiently on BIPAP. An EKG revealed LBBB
with no prior EKG for comparison. He was started on Heparin.
Initial enzymes revealed a CK of 132, Ck-MB 36 and an index of
27, trop I of 1.41. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. He endorses a cough productive of thick sputum for several
weeks. He denies any abdominal pain or dysuria. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope prior to the
current event. He never had any pulmonary edema or [**Location (un) **].
.
In the ED the patient was found to have a HR at 104, BP 126/86,
O2SAt of 100% on NRB. He was complaining of CP [**1-20**] and Nitro
gtt was continued from the OSH. However his BP was low on Nitro
gtt and he was then given MOrphine and Nitro gtt was titrated
off as he was chest pain free. A Plavix load of 600mg was given
and Zofran was given for nausea.
.
He currently is chest pain free and breathing comfortably. He
only complains of mild chest pain with inspiration which he has
not noticed before. He denies any other complaints.

STUDIES:
TTE [**2198-9-23**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20 %) with global hypokinesis. The inferior and
infero-lateral walls are thinned and akinetic. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Ischemic cardiomyopathy with severely depressed
LVEF. Aortic stenosis is present but the severity cannot be
determined from this study. If clinically indicated, a complete
TTE is recommended to clarify the severity of AS.
.
[**9-24**] CARDIAC CATH:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
shows 1
vessel severe coronary artery disase. The LMCA shows mild
calcifications
without critical lesions.  The pLAD has 90% lesion.  The rest of
the
vessel and its branches are without obstructive disease.  The
LCx is a
non-dominant vessel with 40% lesion in its mid-section.  The RCA
is a
dominant vessel with 40% lesion in its mid-section.
2.  Resting hemodynamic measurement shows aortic stenosis with a
peak to
peak gradient of 30mmHg and calculated valve area of 0.8cm2.
The
central aortic pressure is normal at 108/65mmHg.  The left sided
filling
pressure is elevated with a PCWP and LVEDP of 25mmHg.  There is
moderate
to severe pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery
systolic
pressure of 61mmHg. The cardiac index is mildly depressed at 2.3

L/min/m2.
3. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0 X 18 mm
MiniVision
baremetal stent postdilated to 3.25 with no residual stenosis
(see PTCA
comments for detail).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis with moderately elevated LVEDP.
3. Pulmonary hypertension.
4. Mildly depressed cardiac output.
5. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with a bare metal
stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo with CAD who presents with NSTEMI and CHF. Had cath with
1VD and stenting with BMS. Hospital course discussed by problem:

.
# NSTEMI: Pt likely with UA initially and plaque rupture leading
to NSTEMI. EKG changes improved with Heparin, Nitro, Morphine,
ASA and Plavix load. Patient was then chest pain free, and
intervention occurred the following morning. At cath a BMS was
placed to the proximal LAD. Integrilin gtt was begun
peri-procedurally and continued for 18 hours post-cath. Medical
management was continued with ASA, plavix, atorvastatin, added
ezetimibe (lipid panel revealed LDL not at goal) and metoprolol
12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] as tolerated. Attempt at ACE held due to CRI. Serial
EKGs revelaed LBBB.
.
# Valve disease: ECHO with possible significant AS, however poor
study. Might need preload for adequate CO.
.
# CHF, acute: no
