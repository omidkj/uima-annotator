Tetracycline / Dilaudid (PF) / Pravastatin

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrea, nausea, vomiting, blood in ostomy bag

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- R IJ catheter placed [**2179-5-4**]

History of Present Illness:
54F w Crohn's (on Humira) b/c colitis now s/p sigmoidectomy w
end colostomy, ventral hernia repair, & abdominal wall
reconstruction c/b complete SBO due to adhesive disease & porta1
vein thrombosis, AFib on coumadin presents with 1-2 wks of abd
pain, emesis, fever to 100.7, diarrhea with small amt of BRB
(sml amt BRB she thinks from irritation of the ostomy itself).
.
Pt states that all the members of her family had a GI illness in
the past several weeks; her symptoms were similar to what her
family experienced.  However, over the past week, she developed
crampy abdominal pain that is more consistent with a Crohn's
flare, as well as bloody diarrhea.  She states that this
diarrhea is far more watery that her usual IBD flares.  She has
been unable to keep anything down due to nausea and vomiting.
She has felt progressively more weak with dizziness on standing
as well as palptitations.  Today, the patient became so severe
that she decided to present to an emergency department for
evaluation.
.
Vital signs in the ED: 97.6  88  83/44  16  99 RA
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt's abdomen was noted to be diffusely tender,
especially around ostomy site.  The patient was noted to be
persistently hypotensive in the sBP 80s after 4 L NS
resuscitation and she developed BRB in her ostomy bag.  In total
she received 5L NS, a R IJ was placed and she was ultimately
started on levophed at 10 mcg/min.
.
ED labs were significant for INR 8.3; the patient received 10 mg
IV vitamin K. Lactate 3.4 on admission with improved to 1.3 s/p
IVF administration. She was also started on Zosyn.
.
- EKG: atrial fibrillation with HR 101, LAD, IVCD, STD V4-V6
- CXR: no acute process
- CT abdomen with PO & IV contrast was obtained which showed ?
air near colostomy site as well as stranding
.
The patient was discussed with GI; they felt that no steroids
were needed at the moment.
.
Last set of ED vital signs: 114/50, 77, 25, 95% 2L nc
.

Physical Exam:
ON ADMISSION:
GEN: Obese, pallid, NAD
HEENT: NCAT. EOMI.
NECK: R IJ in place
PULM: Diminished BS bilaterally with faint expiratory wheeze at
bases.
COR: Irregular, +S1S2
[**Last Name (un) **]: Hypoactive BS. Diffusely TTP, worse surrounding ostomy
site.  Ostomy bag with green liquid stool.  Slightly more tender
in RUQ as well, with rebound but no guarding.  Nontender to
percussion & bed shake.
EXT: WWP, unable to palpate pulses. 1+ LE edema
NEURO: AAOx3. MAEE
Peripheral Vascular: (Right radial pulse: Not assessed), (Left
radial pulse: Not assessed), (Right DP pulse: Not assessed),
(Left DP pulse: Not assessed)
Skin:  Not assessed
Neurologic: Responds to: Not assessed, Movement: Not assessed,
Tone: Not assessed


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-4**] no acute process. Frontal and lateral views of the
chest are compared to previous exam from [**2178-5-27**]. Again
seen is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. The lungs remain
clear of consolidation or effusion. The cardiac silhouette is
within normal limits. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unchanged.
.
abd/pelvis CT [**2179-5-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse colonic wall thickening of the remaining colon.
Differential
considerations include changes from patients known Crohn's
disease, infectious or inflammatory causes, or even hemorrhage
given elevated INR and possible high density of the wall in
certain areas.
2. Parastomal hernia with a focus of air within the soft tissues
which is not clearly intraluminal and may be may be
extraluminal. Close clinical followup suggested and repeat can
be performed if desired.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
REASON FOR HOSPITAL ADMISSION:
54 F with Crohn's c/b multiple surgeries & prior SBO presents
with fever, diarrhea, hypotension, BRB per ostomy bag.
.
HOSPITAL COURSE
# HYPOTENSION/SEPTIC SHOCK:  Pt met multiple SIRS criteria
(hypotension, fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis) with suspected
GI source given her abdominal pain & diarrhea. Pulmonary source
was considered but no signs or symptoms of PNA, clear CXR. Low
suspicion for urosepsis as pt without dysuria and urinalysis not
c/w infection. Initially c/f gram negative bacteremia as she was
at high risk for GI translocation. She states that she has had
multiple family members who have had symptoms consistent with
viral GE recently. Concern also that she could have prolonged
course of norovirus given that she is on Humira.  She was
initially treated with aggressive IVF resuscitations which
failed in the ED and she required levophed in the ICU. zosyn and
cipro were started for source control and double coverage.
Aggressive hydration was continued. Levophed was able to be
weaned. Home anti-hypertensives were held and electrolytes
aggressively repleted.  This resolved with treatment
.
# Acute Gastroenteritis: The patient presented with BRB via her
ostomy site (see GIB below) and abdominal pain, c/f infection vs
chrohns flare vs ostomy trauma. Some purulent drainage around
the ostomy site which was sent for culture. Surgery examined the
site and felt that the ostomy looked fine. GI was consulted and
they felt most likely this was an infectious etiology.  Steroids
were held.  No scope was felt to be necessary at this point.
Stool cultures for yersinia, vibrio, e.coli, C.diff, and CMV
viral load were NEGATIVE.  All cx were no growth to date.  She
completed a 5 day course of Cipro/Flagyl, though this was likely
an acute viral illness.
- C. diff PCR and Norovirus serology PENDING at discharge
.
#GI bleeding: pt presented with BRB per ostomy site. HCT was
slightly decreased from baseline on admission and dropped
further with aggressive IV hydration. HCT was trended and
remained stable.  There was no further evidence of bleeding
.
# COAGULOPATHY: Pt with INR 8.3 on admission despite taking
regular warfarin dose, likely due to her acute infectious
process. Repeat INR 2.1 s/p IV vitamin K.  INR 1.6 on hospital
day two.  Warfarin was
