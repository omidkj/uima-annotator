Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective PCN Desensitization for Syphilis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICU Level of Care for Desensitization

History of Present Illness:
35F with a history of syphilis who was referred in by her ID
physician for LP to rule out neurosyphilis and to start
inpatient treatment of syphilis.
.
She was diagnosed with syphilis  on [**2176-1-23**] on routine blood
work at [**Hospital1 **]: she had a positive RPR of 1:256 as well as
negative HepBsAG and Ab, neg HIV, and neg HCV. She was admitted
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2176-2-17**] for an ICU penicillin
desensitization. She did not stay for the completion of her IV
PCN therapy as due to a housing situation. She was assumed to
have neurosyphilis given the high titer, but declined LP for
rule/out. She was put on an alternative regimen that she stopped
due to rash, then completed a course of azithromycin for 3
weeks. Her f/u titer on [**2176-3-7**] was 1:128.
.
She had a long gap without medical attention due to multiple
psychosocial stressors and crack abuse. She decided to seek
treatment for her syphilis on [**2177-1-17**], as she now had a more
stable housing situation and is covered by MassHealth. Her RPR
titer on [**2177-1-17**] was 1:128, thus requiring similar
desensitization.
.
On ROS, patient endorses malaise, occasional blurry vision,
inguinal lymphadenopathy, and arthralgias of both knees over the
past year. She states she has had "boils" in the vaginal and
vulvar areas over the past year, which can start as lumps that
then ulcerate or disappear.  She has one such lump in her groin
now. She denies fever, personality changes, ataxia, photophobia,
headache, stiff neck, skin lesions, gummas, rash, nausea,
vomiting, and urinary incontinence.
.

Past Medical History:
Childhood asthma
Anal prolapse [**9-16**] s/p repair at [**Hospital1 112**]

Social History:
Sexually active with one male partner, using condoms every time;
patient does not want partner to know diagnosis. She lives with
her two children, ages 16 and 20, and is unemployed. She smokes
crack 1-2x/week, most recently several weeks ago, and less
frequently than over the last year. She smokes 0-2 marijuana
blunts each day. She has occasional alcohol use ([**12-11**] pint malibu
every month). Believes she contracted syphilis from a rape 10
years ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) S/p penicillin desensitization protocol: The patient was
admitted to the medical intensive care unit for elective PCN
desensitization, which she tolerated well. She did not need
methylpred, famotidine, Benadryl, or epi.
.
2) Syphilis: Following densitization, the patient was started on
a full dose 4 million units IV q4h of Pen G on [**2177-5-16**]. Prior
to abx, she had an LP which showed 4 WBC (98%L) 0 RBC, negative
gram stain, Protein and Glucose normal. She had no signs or
symptoms of meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, tabes
dorsalis, or general paresis to suggest neurosyphilis; her neuro
exam was stable without focality. Her treatment algorithm was as
follows: if LP was positive for VDRL, treatment would be PCN 4
MU IV q4h x 2 wks. If LP was negative for VDRL, she would have
benzathine pen G 2.4 mu im qwk x 3 only plus oral PCN at 250 mg
po qd to avoid low serum levels and cancellation of the
desensitization.
.
On [**2177-5-18**], the patient decided to leave against medical advice
as she did not want to wait for the results of her testing, in
particular the CSF VDRL send-out test. Her serum RPR was still
pending at that time, but came back after her departure at 1:8
titer. Her CSF VDRL is stil pending.
.
3) Headache and back pain: In the am of [**2177-5-18**], the patient
complained of frontal HA and pain along spine, non-tender to
palpation. She had pain on neck flexion; she had negative Kernig
and Brudzinski signs, with no vision changes, photophobia, N/V,
or focal neuro deficits.  A trial of tylenol the night before
was deemed inadequate by the patient. She was given 500 mg
caffeine benzoate in 1L NS infused over 1 hr with good result
for post-LP HA. Her HA resolved with this treatment
.
4) Diarrhea: The patient had an episode of brown diarrhea the
night before she left AMA with strings of white "worms" further
defined as mucous, pain with defecation, and a bit of blood on
the toilet paper after she wiped. She flushed before anyone saw
the stool. She had this "white" diarrhea before when she had
anal prolapse, but none since she was treated with surgery. She
has no history of fissures or hemorrhoids. This was deemed most
likely a side effect of penicillin, but C.diff cultures were
sent as a precaution from a subsequent stool sample.
5) Social: The patient left AMA before a social work consult to
ensure the patient would have the highest likelihood of
following up with her syphilis treatment program.
