HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old gentleman
with a history of severe coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft x2, recent admission to [**Hospital1 1444**] for ST elevation myocardial
infarction on [**2154-10-12**], moderate aortic stenosis,
congestive heart failure, and chronic renal insufficiency,
admitted again on [**2154-10-25**] for failure to thrive
secondary to decompensated congestive heart failure.

On admission, patient appeared very cachectic and fluid
overloaded.  Swan Ganz catheter revealed CVP pressure of 22,
PA systolic and diastolic pressures of 68/26, with capillary
wedge pressure of 30.  He was started on dobutamine and
dopamine drip and was aggressive diuresed with Lasix.

After a long discussion with patient and his family, decision
was made to continue medical management, but not to pursue
any invasive interventions including valvuloplasty for the
aortic stenosis.  His code status was changed to DNR/DNI.
However, despite aggressive medical management, the patient
arrested around 10 pm on [**2154-10-30**] after a run of
V-T which turned into torsade V-fib.  When on the on-call
house staff was called to examine the patient, the patient
had already been in cardiopulmonary arrest.  Death was
pronounced and family was informed.  The family declined a
postmortem examination.

DIAGNOSES:  Cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, aortic
stenosis, congestive heart failure, chronic renal
insufficiency.
