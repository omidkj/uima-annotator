Pertinent Results:
MRI head:
No acute infarction or hemorrhage is seen. There are scattered
small vessel ischemic sequela in the subcortical and
periventricular white matter. There is prominence of ventricles
and sulci compatible with volume loss for age.
Intracranial flow voids are maintained.
Bilateral mastoid opacification is seen. Mild sphenoid and
ethmoid opacification is also noted.
IMPRESSION:
No acute infarction.
.
CT Head: FINDINGS: No hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift of normally
midline structures, hydrocephalus or infarction is apparent. No
fractures are identified. The paranasal sinuses are clear aside
from minimal mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent compatible with the patient's
age. There is dense calcification of the cavernous carotid
arteries.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, or mass.
.
EEG:
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and
disorganized, low voltage background with bursts of generalized
slowing, consistent with an encephalopathy. Sedatives,
infection, metabolic disturbances, and anoxia are among the most
common causes. No epileptiform features or electrographic
seizures were seen.
.
TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior akinesis and mid inferolateral
hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2135-11-4**], resting left ventricular regional
dysfunction is new and mitral regurgitation is now more
prominent.
.
Thyroid US:
Examination is limited by patient's severe shortness of breath.
The right lobe of the thyroid measures 3.1 x 2.6 x 2.1 cm, and
the left lobe measures 3.9 x 3.4 x 1.8 cm. Several tiny
predominantly anechoic colloid nodules are present in the right
lobe of the thyroid. The largest nodule is in the right lobe of
the thyroid, and is predominantly isoechoic measuring 9 x 9 x 11
mm. No discrete nodules are identified on the left.
.
IMPRESSION: 11 x 9 x 9-mm isoechoic nodule in right lobe of
thyroid. If biopsy is contemplated, this should be performed
when the patient's shortness of breath has resolved.
.
CXR [**7-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Stable perihilar airspace opacities and pulmonary
vascular redistribution concerning for CHF. Obscuration of the
left hemidiaphragm likely related to consolidation or effusion.
Further evaluation with a lateral film is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo M with COPD, DM2, HTN who presented from home, where he
was found down, possible seizure activity.
.
#Question of Seizure: Pt has no h/o seizure.  Uncertain whether
activity witnessed by EMS was truly a seizure.  Neuro was
consulted on admission.  EEG showed no seizure activity, though
it was perfomed 24 hours after the event.  EEG demonstrated
toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.  MRI head showed small ischemic
disease only.  If pt did seize, possible triggers for may have
been brain mass, CVA, toxic/metabolic abnormality.  Head CT
showed no evidence of hemorrhage, infarction, or mass. Tox
screen negative. Pt did have some metabolic
derangements--hyperglycemic and in renal failure and was also
febrile, any of these may have precipitated the event.   He had
no further witnessed seizure activity. Patient will need repeat
EEG as outpatient to reevaluate.
.
#Mental status change/? fall: cause unclear.  Possibly due to
post-ictal state (if pt in fact seized) vs. encephalopathy.
Numerous factors were likely contributing to his MS/possible
encephalopathy: he was hyperglycemic (sugars in 600s), in acute
renal failure, likely ACS, & possible PNA.  Pt's mental status
began clearing once he was extubated and acute issues (as above)
were treated.  He was alert and oriented and began to recall
events leading up to his admission.
.
#Respiratory acidosis/COPD: pt intubated due to his impaired
consciousness and respiratory drive.  Also question of
pnuemonia, possibly [**2-22**] aspiration in setting of mental status
changes, and possibly COPD exacerbation.   Treated for
CAP/aspiration PNA with ceftriaxone/azithro/flagyl.  COPD
treated with standing nebulizer treatments.  Pt extubated <48hr
after intubation.  His oxygen was weaned down to 2L NC with O2
sats in high 90s. He denied SOB.  A PICC was placed for IV
antibiotics.  He will need to co
