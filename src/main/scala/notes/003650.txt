Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
84 year old male with history of A Fib, CAD who presents with
dizziness of one day duration. Patient reported feeling dizzy to
VNA nurse who found him to be hypotensive 90/50 and bradycardic
40s. Patient describes palpitations and weakness. Patient has
history of dizziness - however only positional where today was
at rest. He had mild chest discomfort in ED which resolved with
no intervention. Patient denies shortness of breath, nausea.
Describes baseline lower extremity edema, denies orthopnea and
PND. Otherwise patient feels his usual state of health. Denies
recent fever or chills.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.5, BP 107/43, HR 37-44, RR 18,
SaO2 100% RA. BP stable from 109-143. Per report HR ranged from
30-50. Patient asymptomatic. Did not require Atropine.
.
Of note he saw his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2168-10-14**] who
decreased his Atenolol from 50 to 25 secondary to bradycardia.
Patient was admitted [**4-25**] through [**4-29**], with chest
discomfort, peripheral edema, and dyspnea and was found to be in
atrial fibrillation with a slow response (42 BPM). He was
monitored on telemetry where asymptomatic pauses of [**4-13**] seconds
were noted. When his atenolol was discontinued, his heart rate
apparently intermittently increased to greater than 100 BPM and
he was therefore started on a lower dose of Atenolol.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old male with A Fib, CAD who presented with "dizziness"
and bradycardia, s/p pacemaker placement.
.
# RHYTHM: Atrial fibrillation with intraventricular conduction
delay. Patient bradycardiac ranging from 30-50 on admission, now
with pacemaker in place.  TSH normal.  His Atenolol was
restarted at 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for control of his afib.  He will need a
total of 3 days of keflex on discharge (course to be completed
end of day on [**2168-11-21**]).  He was also discharged on warfarin and
will require f/u in [**Hospital3 **], as well as EP f/u

intervention.  Troponins negative to date.  He was continued on
ASA on discharge.
.
# PUMP: Known diastolic chronic congestive heart failure. No SOB
or signs of fluid overload on exam while in the hospital.  ACE,
statin, Bblocker were continued as pressures would tolerate
while in-patient, he was then discharged on all three
medications.
.
# Hypertension: Discharged on atenolol and lasix.  Amlodipine
held as pressures were WNL without amlodipine, however could
re-start on f/u if pressures can tolerate.
.
# Dyslipidemia: Simvastatin was continued as an inpatient and on
discharge.
.
# BPH: Proscar and doxazosin were held for low BPs, but
restarted on discharge when pressures were stable.
.
