History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14164**] is a 22 year-old African-American woman with known
[**Known lastname 14165**] cell disease, who presents with a 1-day history of
right-sided posterior chest pain.

She notes that she was well until 4-days prior to admission when
she developed URI symptoms, including headache, rhinorrea, and
generalized fatigue. She subsequently developed a cough,
productive of small amounts of dark yellow sputum. Yesterday,
she developed right-sided posterior chest pain, pleuritic in
nature, worse with coughing, deep breathing and lying on the
culprit side. She reports only mild SOB. She felt warm over the
past few days, but did not measure her temperature. She denies
chills. She is unsure whether she has received Pneumovax and
Influenza vaccines.

ROS is otherwise negative for other joint pain. No GI or urinary
complaints. No lightheadedness, no dizziness.

In the ED, vitals initially T 99.4, HR 80, BP 119/58, RR 16,
oxygen saturation 95% on 3L, 88% on room air. A CXR revealed a
RLL infiltrate. She was given Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV X1 and
Azithromycin 500 mg PO QD. She was also given Morphine 1 mg IV
X1, Benadryl 25 mg X1, and Dilaudid for pain control.

Past Medical History:
1. [**Known lastname **] cell disease, with 1 admission per year since [**2100**] for
acute pain crisis.
2. History of gonorrhea
3. Prior pneumonia versus acute chest syndrome in [**2100**]
4. History of pre-eclampsia during her first pregnancy
5. Known multiple RBC allo-antibodies and difficult cross-match

Social History:
She lives with her 2 children aged 4 and 2 years-old. She is an
active smoker, and smokes about 5 cigarettes per day. She quit
for about 3 years, but restarted last year. No EtOH consumption.
She also denies illicit drug use.

Family History:
She lived in a [**Doctor Last Name **] home from the age of 5 onwards. Per OMR
records, both her mother and father have [**Name2 (NI) 14165**] cell trait. Both
her children have [**Name2 (NI) 14165**] cell trait.

Relevant imagind studies:

[**2103-5-19**] CXR: Stable cardiac contours. Interval development of
patchy opacity in right lower lobe, no pleural effusion.

[**2103-5-20**] CXR: Heart size is within normal limits and there is no
evidence for CHF. There is consolidation in the right middle and
right lower lobes with an associated small right pleural
effusion, increased when compared with the prior film of [**5-19**], 05. There is atelectasis at the left lung base as previously
demonstrated. There is probably some associated collapse of the
right lobe.

IMPRESSION: Increase in extent of right middle lobe and right
lower lobe consolidation with small right pleural effusion. Left
basilar atelectasis.

[**2103-5-21**] CXR: The cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal
in size and there is slight increase in pulmonary vascularity,
consistent with the patient's known [**Year/Month/Day 14165**] cell status. There
are multifocal areas of consolidation involving the right middle
and both lower lobes, which have progressed in the interval.
There are also bilateral probable small pleural effusions.

IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal consolidation suggesting
multifocal pneumonia. [**Year/Month/Day **] cell lung is in the differential
diagnosis if there are not infectious symptoms present.

[**2103-5-22**] CXR: No significant interval change.

[**2103-5-23**] CXR: Increased mild to moderate left pleural effusion.
Persistent right middle and lower lobe infiltrate with right
pleural effusion, stable.

[**2103-5-24**] CXR: Slight interval improvement in right middle lobe
aeration. Slight improvement in right pleural effusion. Stable
left pleural effusion with left lower lobe retrocardiac
atelectasis.

[**2103-5-26**] CXR: Improving right middle lobe and left lower lobe
opacities. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion
unchanged.

********
[**2103-5-22**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitatino. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
22 year-old African-American woman with [**Year/Month/Day 14165**] cell disease
admitted with respiratory symptoms and right-sided back pain,
found to have RLL infiltrate + hypoxemia.

1) Pneumonia +/- acute chest syndrome: CXR on admission revealed
a RLL infiltrate suspicious for pneumonia, although acute chest
syndrome can not be ruled out. Examination was also remarkable
for hypoxemia, with saturation in the low 80s. She was
empirically started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for coverage
of Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Hemophilus and pneumococcus, and
hydrated. She was afebrile on admission, but subsequently
developed a fever in hospital with rising WBC up to 34.6 on
[**5-21**]. She also developed worsening hypoxemia on [**5-21**] with
increasing SOB in the setting of decreasing hematocrit to 15.5,
then 14.3. An ABG revealed pH 7.41/38/70. A repeat CXR was
performed and remarkable for worsening RML/RLL pneumonia. Given
the above as well as inability to transfuse PRBCs [**3-21**] no
available cross-matched blood (multiple allo-antibodies), Ms.
[**Known lastname 14164**] was transferred to the ICU on [**5-20**].

In the ICU, supportive care was provided. She was continued on
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. Sputum cultures returned as OP
flora, without predominance of organisms (can not rule out
Chlamydia or Mycoplasma). Blood and urine cultures all returned
negative. Serial CXRs initially revealed worsening picture, with
interval development of a LLL infiltrate consistent with
multilobar process, and bilateral pleural effusions. An echo was
performed that showed normal EF>60%. The effusions were
ultimately felt most likely [**3-21**] fluid overload in the setting of
aggressive IVF administration, and she was diuresed with Lasix
on [**5-23**] and [**5-24**]. She eventually improved and defervesced,
with decreasing oxygen requirements and improved radiographic
picture. Antibiotics were changed to PO Levofloxacin on [**5-24**],
Ceftriaxone D/C'd on [**5-24**] (received 6 days), and Azithromycin
D/C'd on [**5-25**] (received 7 days). She will complete a 14-day
course (total) of Levofloxacin (last dose on [**2103-6-1**]).

Of note, the effusions persist at discharge, stable in size. She
also has persistent leukocytosis with WBC 16.2 at discharge.
Both should improve with time. She will need follow-up imaging
after completi
