Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
direct admit for CHF management s/p cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of 3 vessel
CAD s/p redo CABGx3 and multiple stents, systolic and diastolic
CHF, HTN, HLD, CRF with exacerbations following cath who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with dyspnea.  The patient was admitted last
week on [**12-11**].  At that time he had a cardiac cath where he was
found to have instent restenosis of LM to LCx and ostial LAD.
His LIMA and SVG to OM were patent at that time.  At that time
he had balloon angioplasty was performed to the ostial LAD as
well as LM to LCx with cutting balloon.  The patient was
discharged without a change in creatinine.  Last night at 2am,
the patient experienced chest pain and dyspnea.
.
While at home, he denied having fevers, was compliant with all
his medications (confirmed with the wife). He denied any
excessive fluids. The only recent medication changes doubling of
his metoprolol to 50, doubling of lisinopril to 5, and stoppage
of zantac.
.
In the ED, the patient was hypoxic requiring 100% NRB.  He
received 40mg IV lasix and symptoms improved marginally.  Crn
was increased to 1.7 from prior at 1.4.  He was taken back to
the cath lab on [**12-15**] and found to have 50% recoil in the LCx and
LAD with competitive flow from the LIMA.  No intervention was
done.  He continued to require 100% NRB, received 100mg IV
lasix.  As he continued to require 100% NRB he was sent to the
CCU for monitoring.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2126-12-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
inferolateral and inferior walls are thinned and akinetic. The
function of the anterior wall and lateral wall is relatively
preserved. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-11-4**],
the degree of mitral regurgitation has increased and the degree
of aortic regurgitation has decreased. Estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures are higher on the current study.
.
[**12-17**] CXR : As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
minimal improvement with improved ventilation of the lung bases.
The overall extent of the pre-described bilateral and
predominantly mid and lower lung
parenchymal opacities, however, are unchanged. The opacities are
likely to
represent a combination of infection and pulmonary edema, as
emphasized in the previous written report. Moderate
cardiomegaly, presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot
be excluded. No evidence of pneumothorax.
.
===================HISTORICAL DATA===================
[**11-4**] Echo:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate to
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular cavity size is normal with borderline normal free
wall motion. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly

thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**1-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to

moderate ([**1-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with marked
global hypokinesis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-3-12**], the

severity of aortic regurgitation is increased (may be related to

much higher systemic blood pressure). The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now lower. Bieventricular sizes and
systolic function are similar.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2123**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
