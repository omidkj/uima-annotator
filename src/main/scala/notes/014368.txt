History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41304**] is a 52 year old male with newly diagnosed Type II
diabetes, recent gum surgery, neck and back pain. He presented
to [**Location (un) 620**] [**2148-4-7**], with 4/4 bottles gram positive cocci, and
subsequently started on Oxacillin, and Vancomycin. He was noted
to have epidural abscess on L spine MR scout images, and found
to have a new heartmurmur.  Due to MSSA bacteremia with seeding
to multiple sites, he was transferred for further treatment and
evaluation.

[**2148-4-8**] Spine MRI: Findings of concern for multiple sites of
epidural infection as well as cervical-thoracic prevertebral
soft tissue swelling and possible C6- C7 disc infection.
[**2148-4-9**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No mass is
definitively seen associated with the aortic valve. The mitral
valve leaflets are very mildly thickened. There is partial
mitral leaflet flail that involves the P3 scallop. Torn mitral
chordae appear present at the tip of this segment. An
endocarditic lesion associated with this can not be completely
ruled out. There is an eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of at
least mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation.
[**2148-4-10**] RUQ Ultrasound: 1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty
infiltration. Other forms of liver disease including
cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded on this study. 2.
Cholelithiasis. Minimal gallbladder wall thickening. 3.
Splenomegaly with several apparent hypoechoic raising concern
for micro- or macro-abscess, in this clinical setting.
[**2148-4-20**] Abdominal CT Scan: 1. Hypodense splenic lesions
suggestive of splenic infarcts. No splenic abscesses or
collections noted in the spleen.
2. Stones within a contracted gallbladder with no signs of acute
cholecystitis. 3. Mild ascites is seen in the pelvis. 4. Status
post extensive lower thoracic and lumbar laminectomy with post-
surgical changes involving the posterior muscles of the back. A
catheter is introduced through the back from the sacral level
and is embedded with tip embedded in the T11 thoracic vertebral
body posteriorly. No adjacent pockets of air or fluid suspicious
for inflammation is noted. 5. Abnormal swelling and thickening
of the left piriform muscle and medial portion of the gluteus
minimus/medius. This appearance is nonspecific. Focal area of
myositis cannot be excluded.
[**2148-4-23**] Ultrasound Guided PICC Placement: Uncomplicated
ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided placement of a
double-lumen hemodialysis catheter measuring 27 cm from tip to
cuff through the right common jugular venous approach. The tip
of the catheter is located within the right atrium.
[**2148-4-25**] TEE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
partial flail of the posterior mitral leaflet. There is a small
(3-mm) echodensity of the posterior mitral leaflet, which is
likely a flail portion of the valve, but a small vegetation
cannot be excluded. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2148-4-26**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right-dominant system demonstrated no angiographically-apparent
coronary artery disease. 2. Resting hemodynamic assessment
revealed normal systemic arterial blood pressure (135/76 mmHg)
and moderately elevated pulmonary arterial pressure (50/9 mmHg).
The left and right-sided filling pressures were markedly
elevated with LVEDP 24 mmHg, PCWP 26 mmHg and RVEDP 19 mmHg.
The cardiac index and cardiac output were in the upper normal
range (8.6
l/min and 3.6 l/mi/m2 sons[**Name (NI) 77463**]). 3. [**Name2 (NI) 2325**] ventriculography
deferred.
[**2148-4-29**] Intraop TEE: PREBYPASS - Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial mitral poster
(P3)leaflet flail. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
MR jet is eccentric and directed anteriorly.
POSTBYPASS - LV systolic function appears normal. RV systolic
function now appears normal. There is ring prosthesis in the
mitral annular position. Trace valvular MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 48613**]. The
study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Infectious Disease: Followed closely throughout his hospital
stay by the ID service for his Methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus bactermia/sepsis which was complicated by
epidural abcesses of the cervical, lumbar and thoracic
spine(Staph aureus) along
