Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
45M with a history of MI s/p BMS to RCA 10 years ago is admitted
s/p witnessed cardiac arrest. According to the report, he
collapsed while at work, a bystander found him breathing with a
bleeding laceration to his right forehead and initiated CPR x 20
minutes until EMS arrived, placed an AED, which delivered a
single shock. He received another 40 minutes of compressions and
atropine 1mg, epinephrine 1mg and lidocaine 100mg while
intransit to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital.
.
According to the report, on arrival to Widdham, he was in PEA,
he was treated with epinephrine 1mg x 3, Atropine 1mg x2, and
Amiodarone 300mg and converted to VF, he was cardioverted x 3
and re-entered PEA. He was treated with narcan 2mg, another
epinephrine 1mg x 4 amiodarone 150mg, and re-entered VF and was
cardioverted 2x after which return of spontaneous circulation
was noted. He was started on a amiodarone, heparin and dopamine
drips. In total, he received CPR for 48 minutes at Widdham with
possibly another 60 minutes of CPR in the field. Cooling
protocol was initiated and he was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation and further management. Fixed and dialated pupils
were noted prior to transfer. On transfer, his vitals were
Temp:95, P:136 BP:94/58, rhythm strip showed afib with RVR.
.
On arrival to the ED, his vitals were: T:91.9 P:121 BP:117/84.
Initial EKG showed Atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of
126BPM, STE in V4-5 STD II, III, aVF, q waves in II, III, aVF.
In comparison to the EKG from [**2139**], q waves are unchanged,
STD/STE are new. He was successfully cardioverted to sinus
rhythm. Repeat EKG showed improvement in STE/STD with decreased
ventricular rate. CT head showed no acute process, CTA chest
showed emphysematous blebs and no PE. He was admitted to the
CCU.
.
On admission to the CCU, his vitals were BP 123/94, P:83, 100%
on vent settings of 500/12/5 PEEP FIO2 0.5. He was taken to the
cath lab, which showed chronically occluded RCA and LAD with a
patent LCX. Given chronicity of lesions, no intervention was
performed. Ischemic cardiomyopath likely VT/VF arrest. After
cardiac cath patient entered sinus tachycardia and was given
metoprolol leading to hypotension and return of atrial
fibrillation, he was again cardioverted to sinus rhythm. Given
furosemide with appropirate urine output.
.
On discussion with the family, patient has not sought medical
care in the last 9 1/2 years. Following his cardiac cath in
[**2139**], patient was compliant with aspirin, plavix, atenolol,
lisinopril, and lipitor for roughly 6 months after which he
discontinued all medications except Aspirin 81mg and nitro PRN
which he has not taken recently. Accodording to the wife, he has
had long standing dyspnea on exertion, worse in the winter
months. She notes that he does not complain of orthopnea, PND,
palpatations. She reports that he has never had loss of
consciousness.

CT CHEST (performed at OSH,[**2149-12-31**] read by [**Hospital1 18**])
The patient is intubated, with the ET tube terminating within
the distal
trachea. A transesophageal catheter terminates within the
stomach with the
side port at the GE junction.
.
Multiple large blebs are seen throughout both lungs,
predominantly in the
upper zones. There is neighboring interstitial fibrosis.
Moderate dependent atelectasis is seen with enhancement
throughout most of the parenchyma, although there are pockets of
hypoperfusion which may signify an early infectious process
(5:118). No pneumothorax is seen. The great vessels are patent
and normal in caliber. No pulmonary embolism is detected to the
subsegmental levels.
.
The heart size is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is no
effusion or pulmonary edema.
.
Included views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a
normal-appearing liver,
stomach, spleen, and left adrenal gland.
.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture or dislocation.
No concerning
blastic or lytic lesions are detected.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple large blebs in a panlobar pattern, raising suspicion
for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency.
2. Moderate dependent atelectasis with pockets of hypoperfused
lung
parenchyma, raising the possibility of early infection or
aspiration.
3. No PE detected to the subsegmental levels.
.
CT HEAD (performed at OSH,[**2149-12-31**] read by [**Hospital1 18**]):
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in
configuration. No acute fracture is seen. A small mucous
retention cyst is present within the right maxillary sinus.
There is mucosal thickening seen within the sphenoid sinuses,
greater on the right. The middle ear cavities and mastoid air
cells are clear.
  .
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mild sinus disease.
.
ECHO [**2150-1-1**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is an apical left
ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to multiple focal
wall motion abnormalities including extensive apical akinesis
with focal dyskinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
