Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-4**] Aortic Valve Replacement (21mm [**Company 1543**] porcine valve),
Coronary Artery Disease (Saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery)

History of Present Illness:
85F with critical Aortic Stenosis, diastolic Heart Failure, and
Coronary Artery Disease who presented with dyspnea since [**2-25**].
She had been symptomatic from her aortic stenosis with dyspnea
at rest, worse with exertion for the past several months. She
also experiences angina with any exertion and had 1 syncopal
episode 2 months ago in setting of NTG use. Pt developed
shortness of breath last night, similar to her usual dyspnea,
worsened overnight. In am she called EMS who found her to be
tachypneic to the 30s, with 02 sats in the 70s. She was placed
on a NRB with increase in 02 to 90s, BP was initally elevated to
systolic 180. She was noted to have crackles throughout her lung
fields on exam and was given 60mg IV lasix as well as a NTG tab
in the field. On arrival her VS 97.7 65 135/52 100% (bipap)
crackles were persistently appreciated and she was placed on
BiPAP. She was given 1 full dose ASA. Had a CXR which showed low
lung volumes, b/l effusions and pulmonary edema. ECG showed no
change from prior. Labs notable for negative cardiac enzymes,
normal CBC and renal function, normal electrolytes, lactate 2.7.
On BiPAP her RR decreased to 18, BP stabilized at 90-110s. UOP
>700cc. At time of transfer her VS: Afebrile 63 96/45 19 97% 40%
Fi02 on [**5-20**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2-27**] Carotid U/S: 1. No significant ICA stenosis on either side.
2. Antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
[**3-4**] Echo: PRE BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The
left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricle displays moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.4 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study. POST
BYPASS: The patient was initially AV paced but then just A
paced. The right ventricle displays normal systolic function.
The left ventricle displays improved systolic function. Ejection
fraction is now in the range of 45% to 50% with mild global
hypokinesis bordering on low normal systolic function. There is
a bioprosthesis positioned in the aortic position. It appears
well seated. The leaflets can not be seen. There is a very small
perivalvular jet of aortic regurgitation seen near the position
of the native non-coronary cusp. The maximum gradient through
the aortic valve is about 27 mm Hg with a mean gradient of about
20 mm Hg at a cardiac output near 5 liters/min. Initially after
cardiopulmonary bypass, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
remained. However, about 20 minutes after bypass, with the start
of atrial pacing, the mitral regurgitation was improved to mild
to moderate. No other significant changes from the prebypass
period are noted.

Reason: eval for position of line and PTX



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   85 year old woman with central line change
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for position of line and PTX



Provisional Findings Impression: [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 16276**] [**Doctor First Name **] [**2160-3-6**] 12:12 PM
PFI: New CVL line tip in right atrium without pneumothorax.


Final Report
INDICATION: Central line change. Evaluate for line placement.

FINDINGS: Bedside AP upright chest radiograph was compared to
[**2160-3-5**] and demonstrates replacement of a right CVL within the
right atrium.
There is no pneumothorax. The heart is enlarged. Cardiac and
mediastinal
contours are stable. There are bibasilar opacities that likely
represent
atelectasis. There is no pulmonary edema.

IMPRESSION: New right IJ CVL in the right atrium without
pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted under cardiology and received care for
acute on chronic diastolic heart failure secondary to aortic
stenosis. She was stabilized with medical management and
underwent usual pre-operative work-up. On [**3-4**] she was brought
to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery
bypass graftx1 (Saphenous vein graft Posterior descending
artery) and aortic valve replacement(#21mm [**Company 1543**] Porcine
valve). Cross clamp time: 68 minutes.Cardiopulmonary Bypass
time:85 minutes. Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **] operative report
for further details. Ms.[**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] the procedure
well and was transferred in stable but critical condition to the
CVICU. She awoke neurologically intact and was extubated early
on POD#1. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely
fashion. Beta-blocker,Aspi
