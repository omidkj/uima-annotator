Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 44880**] is a 55 y/o M w/h/o Ulcerative colitis who was
admitted to the Colorectal Surgery service at [**Hospital1 18**] after an
open proctocolectomy with end-ileostomy on [**2164-7-9**], please see
the operative note for more detail.  Postoperatively he was
transfered to the ICU for hyperglycemia and was started on an
insulin drip.  This was stopped and he was transitioned to NPH
on POD1 and he was transferred to the floor.  On POD2 he was
noted to have sanguenous drainage from his JP site and he
recieved 2 units of PRBCs.  This resolved and his JP was removed
on POD4.  He was slowly advanced to a regular diet and he was
tolearting this well at discharge.  His post-operative course
was complicated by chest pain and shortness of breath on POD 5;
a CTA performed showed bilateral subsegmental PEs for which he
was started on a heparin gtt.  On POD8 he was started on
lovenox.  Later that day he noted significant bleeding from his
perineal wound.  This resolved with pressure and he was
transitioned back to heparin gtt with a lower PTT goal.  He had
an IVC filter placed on POD10 by vascular surgery, please see
their operative note for more detail.  On POD11/1 he had another
episode of bleeding from his perineal wound so his
anticoagulation was stopped.  His post operative course was
further complicated by urinary retention.  His foley was
replaced on POD7 and he will go home with a leg bag with follow
up with urology.  He was noted to have a UTI on POD11/1, he was
started on Cipro, which he will continue a 3 day course of at
home. On the day of discharge he was ambulating well and
tolerating a regular diet, he was stable for discharge to home
with VNA for wound and ostomy care, and close follow up with the
ostomy nurses, urology, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**].

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after an Open Proctocolectomy
for surgical management of your ulcerative colitis. You have
recovered from this procedure well and you are now ready to
return home.  You have tolerated a regular diet, are passing gas
and your pain is controlled with pain medications by mouth. You
may return home to finish your recovery.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. If you have any of
the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go
to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal
distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose stool, or
constipation.

You have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a
new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed
into the body and the stool becomes formed. You must measure
your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If
you find that your output has become too much or too little,
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the
