Pertinent Results:
Echo [**5-25**] - EF 30%
1.The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is moderate global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is
elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**5-25**]
New mild CHF.
.
Head CT [**5-24**]
No evidence of hemorrhage. Small vessel ischemic changes and a
moderate degree of atrophy.
.
SHOULDER [**2-16**] VIEWS NON TRAUMA LEFT  [**2125-5-28**] 9:16 AM: Somewhat
similar external/internal rotation AP views. There is a linear
calcific density along the edge of the humeral head on the
internal rotation view. The possibility of a small fracture
fragment arising from the humeral head cannot be excluded,
though no obvious donor site is detected. The remainder of the
left proximal humerus is intact. No other fractures are seen
about the shoulder girdle. Degenerative changes of the AC joint
are present. Of note, no Y or axillary view was obtained,
limiting assessment of glenohumeral joint alignment. If there is
continuing clinical concern for glenohumeral joint
subluxation/dislocation, then an axillary or Y view would be
recommended.
IMPRESSION: Calcific density adjacent to humeral head -- a small
fracture cannot be excluded.
.
Axillary view of the left shoulder. [**2125-5-30**].: A single
axillary view has been performed. This demonstrates no signs of
posterior or anterior shoulder dislocation. No gross fractures
are noted.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2125-5-30**] 1:45 PM
IMPRESSION: Resolved pulmonary edema.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Syncope - Patient with syncope prior to admisison. Ruled out
for MI. No history of seizure. Monitoring on tele. CT head
normal. This was felt to be most likely vasovagal vs.
dehydration. She was hydrated and had no further episodes of
syncope while in house.
.
# Hypertensive Emergency: On the second day of admission, the
patient became acutely hypertensive (180/110), dyspnic, and
hypoxic. ABG 7.18/76/96 on 100% NRB. The patient was transferred
to the MICU overnight and improved with 60mg iv lasix. She was
stable in the unit overnight with decreased BP was weaned off of
oxygen. It was felt that pt does not tolerate increased BP given
her CHF and diastolic dysfunction. Her BP was better controlled
by adding norvasc and imdur to her regimen. It is recommended
that she should have an eval for RAS given severe HTN. MRA
should be completed at some point.
.
# Pump: Patient intravascularly dry with total body volume
overload. Echo with decreased EF 30%. She was continued on
bblocer, [**Last Name (un) **], dig.
.
# UTI: pt had urine cultures that grew E. coli that was
pansensitive (except Macrobid). She is currently receiving cipro
x 10 day course for this. (finish [**6-9**]). She subsequently grew
yeast out of her urine and the foley was changed. As the pt
becomes more mobile her foley should be removed as soon as
possible. If urine cultures continue to grow yeast she may need
oral treatment for this.
.
# Fevers: The pt intermittently spiked fevers during her
admission. At the time of discharge the only positive cultures
were the Urine as described above, and one blood culture that
grew coag neg staph in [**1-17**] bottles. The pt was initially tx'd
with vanc until this was speciated, but then the vanc was d/c'd
after 1 day as it was felt this was likely a contaminant. She
was subsequently afebrile. CXR showed no pna - only resolved
pulmonary edema.
.
# Rash on L extremity with pain: The patient c/o L shoulder pain
on admission and subsequently developed a vesicular rash that
was VZV positive.
