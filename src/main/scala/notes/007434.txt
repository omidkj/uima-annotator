DIAGNOSIS:  Acute pulmonary edema.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old male, with
past medical history significant for coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass graft, [**Year (4 digits) 1291**], congestive
heart failure and diabetes.  Transferred from [**Hospital 100167**]
rehabilitation on [**9-11**].  The patient had recently
been admitted for a left below the knee amputation and was
discharged to [**Hospital 100167**] rehabilitation on the 17th.  On that
morning, he developed hypoxia to 80% on room air, was
hypertensive to 212/122 with rales and frothy white sputum.
He was intubated and given nitrous oxide, Lasix, Morphine.
His chest x-ray showed severe pulmonary edema.

The patient had subsequent hypotension to 77/57 and was
started on a Dopamine drip.  An electrocardiogram at that
time showed a left bundle branch block and no ischemic
changes.  CK was 123. MB was 16.3. Troponin was 1.59. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] off the
Dopamine drip, on settings of pressure support of 5 and 5 for
further management.

diagonal in [**2169-10-25**].  Congestive heart failure with

abuse, not active.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 83; blood pressure 111/63;
intubated on pressure support of 5 and 5. Respiratory rate of
25. Tidal volume 450. Saturating 92% on FI02 of .40.
General:  Easily arousable, in no acute distress.  HEAD,
EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Neck:  No jugular venous distention, no bruits.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, 2/6 systolic murmur, heard
best at the right upper sternal border and the left lower
sternal border.  Valve click. No gallops.  Lungs:  Coarse
breath sounds bilaterally, decreased at bases.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Left below the knee amputation stump was well
healed. Mild erythema but no skin break down. Right lower
extremity:  No palpable dorsalis pedis, 1+ posterior tibial,

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 10.4; hematocrit of 33.4;
platelets 186.  Sodium of 145; potassium of 3.7; chloride
103; bicarbonate 74; BUN 24; creatinine 1.4; glucose 220;

10.6; troponin 1.59.  PT of 14.4; PTT of 36.4.  INR of 1.3.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm; first degree
atrioventricular block.  Left bundle branch block.  Increased
T waves as compared to previous electrocardiogram but
otherwise no ischemic changes.

Chest x-ray on admission:  Cardiomegaly; moderate congestive
heart failure with cephalization and interstitial infiltrates
bilaterally.  Right costophrenic angle not visualized.
Arterial blood gases 7.46, 51, 65 on a pressure support of 5
and 5.  40% FI02.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Coronary artery disease.  On admission, the
patient initially refused cardiac catheterization.  He was
continued on Integrolin and heparin drip and also continued
on Plavix and aspirin.  Beta blocker and ace inhibitor were
added and titrated up throughout the hospital as well as
Nystatin.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were thought to be a
troponin leak in the setting of congestive heart failure
decompensation.  The patient, later in hospitalization,
agreed to a cardiac catheterization which was done on
[**9-14**].  Following catheterization, the patient was
well hydrated and then diuresed and started back on daily
Lasix.  He also had an echo which showed an ejection fraction
of 20 to 30% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.  As
compared to his previous echo, there was a decrease in his
ejection fraction and he was successfully extubated on
[**2172-9-13**].  His oxygen requirements were titrated down. He had
increasing secretions and sputum cultures grew out Staph
aureus.  His blood and urine cultures were negative.  The
plan was to treat the patient for a total of two weeks of
antibiotics for ventilator acquired pneumonia.

Hematology:  The patient was admitted and was transfused two
units of blood following his cardiac catheterization and his
hematocrit responded appropriately.  His stools were guaiac
negative.  The patient had minimal nasal bleeding, thought to
be due to traumatic intubation.  This resolved and he was
briefly placed on Afrin initially.  Following his cardiac
catheterization, he was transitioned to Coumadin.  This was
begun for his [**Date Range 1291**].  The patient was started on Coumadin on
[**9-15**], with the plan to titrate down his heparin
drip as his Coumadin became therapeutic.  However, at the
time of discharge, this had not been accomplished.  He will
require further titration and eventually conversion to p.o.
Coumadin at rehabilitation.

Renal:  He was back to his baseline on discharge of 1.0.  He
received Mucomyst with his catheterization.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition/endocrine:  The patient's
electrolytes were followed throughout his hospitalization.
He was placed on sliding scale insulin.  His blood sugars
trended up towards the end of the hospitalization and NPH was
added.  His insulin regimen will require further assessment
over the next few days as his p.o. intake improves.

Peripheral access:  Patient was kept on pneumoboots and
proton pump inhibitor for deep vein thrombosis and
gastrointestinal prophylaxis during his hospitalization.  He
also was on a heparin drip. Code status was full.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was transferred back to U-Ville,
where he will require a resumption of his previous
rehabilitation schedule. Call doctor or go to Emergency Room
for symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, edema,
fevers, chills, or other concerning symptoms.
