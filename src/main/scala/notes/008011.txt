HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3265**] is a 60-year-old
white male with a long history of acid reflux disease.
Recently he was treated with antacid therapy and baking soda,
but has been having refractory acid reflux symptoms.  He
underwent an upper endoscopy in [**2190-5-24**] which basically
revealed a friable, nonobstructing lower esophageal
adenocarcinoma.  The adenocarcinoma involved one-third of the
esophageal circumference.  The biopsies taken at the time
confirmed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma with
papillary features and widespread necrosis.  In addition,
gastritis of the antrum was noted, but the gastroesophageal
junction was not involved based on pathology.  The duodenum
was normal.  The ultrasound-guided staging was performed as
well.  The ultrasound-guided examination of the
mid-esophageal mass demonstrated invasion into the muscularis
propria, but no evidence of invasion beyond this, consistent
with a T2 tumor.  Careful examination of the remainder of the
Barrett's esophagus demonstrated mild wall thickening to 4
mm, limited to the submucosa, with no focal masses noted.  In
addition, there was an 11 mm round isoechoic periesophageal
lymph node noted at 33 cm.  No other lymphadenopathy was
noted.  A CT scan of the abdomen and chest was performed,
which revealed two hyperdense lesions in the liver, but no
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The bilateral pleural
effusions noted were thought to be related to congestive
heart failure and left lobe atelectasis, but there was no
radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.

Subsequently an MRI of the liver was performed, which was
negative for any evidence of metastatic disease to the liver.
The patient was consequently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and a
surgical intervention was recommended.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Upper endoscopy performed in [**2190-5-24**]
showed a friable, nonobstructing lower esophageal
adenocarcinoma involving one-third of the esophageal
circumference.  CT scan of the abdomen performed
preoperatively showed two hyperdense lesions in the liver,
but no mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  In addition,
bilateral pleural effusions were seen, which were thought to
be due to congestive heart failure.  The MRI of the liver
performed preoperatively was negative for any evidence of
metastatic disease in the liver.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the diagnosis of
moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus,
surgery was recommended.  The risks and the benefits of the
procedure were discussed with the patient.  On [**2190-9-27**], the
patient underwent Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy with feeding
jejunostomy and left tube thoracotomy.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well.  The estimated blood loss was 500 cc.
There were no complications.  Please see the full operative
note for details.

The patient remained intubated, and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.  His urine output
was noted to be low.  A Swan-Ganz catheter was in place.  He
remained on ventilator support.  The patient was transfused
with packed red blood cells and received multiple boluses
postoperatively to maintain his urine output.  His pain was
controlled with the epidural catheter.  The antibiotic
coverage included Flagyl and Kefzol originally.  In addition,
the patient received several packs of platelets.  The tube
feeds were initiated.  His blood pressure and heart rate were
controlled with beta blocker.  The patient remained in sinus
rhythm.  The heart rate and blood pressure remained stable.
The chest tube remained in place, and the nasogastric tube
remained to suction.

On [**2190-10-1**], chest x-ray was taken showing a slight interval
increase in the left lower lobe consolidation/collapse.  The
patient was transfused again with packed red blood cells.
The ventilator support was slowly weaned.  His arterial gas
was stable.  The Hematology/Oncology service was consulted,
given the history of chronic myelogenous leukemia and
decreasing white blood cell count.  The recommendation was to
restart Gleevec in order to avoid CML relapse.  The patient
was followed by the Hematology/Oncology service during his
hospitalization.

The patient was extubated on postoperative day three.  His
urine output increased and remained stable.  The patient was
gently diuresed.  A barium swallow study was performed on
[**2190-10-2**], which showed no evidence of contrast extravasation
from the esophagogastric anastomosis.  The fluids were
decreased.

The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
six in stable condition.  Chest physical therapy was
initiated.  The patient was encouraged to get out of bed.

On postoperative day six, the patient complained of severe
chest pain and shortness of breath, but no nausea, vomiting,
and no radiation of the pain.  No diaphoresis at the time.
His vital signs were stable except for a respiratory rate of
28.  He was 95% on 2 liters, and had decreased breath sounds.
Electrocardiogram obtained at the time showed no change from
the baseline.  His diet was slowly advanced to full liquids
in addition to the tube feeds.  Nutrition followed the
patient throughout his hospitalization.

On [**2190-10-4**], the patient was noted to have right arm
swelling.  A right upper extremity venous ultrasound was
obtained, which showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
The antibiotics were discontinued at the time.

On postoperative day ten, the patient again complained of
difficulty breathing.  However, he did not appear to be in
acute respiratory distress given no tachycardia and no
desaturation.  An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2190-10-8**] to
rule out pericardial effusion.  The findings were symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy and regional systolic
dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery
disease.  A PICC line was placed on [**2190-10-8**].  The patient
again complained of shortness of breath and had coarse sounds
on lung examination.  A chest x-ray at the time showed right
basilar atelectasis/consolidation.  The echocardiogram
mentioned previously showed an ejection fraction of 25%.

On [**2190-10-10**], the serum troponin levels were 6.5 at their
peak.  Thus the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction
by enzymes.  Given increased wheezing and shortness of
breath, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit.  The chest tubes were removed a few days prior to this
transfer.  The patient was diuresed with lasix in the
Intensive Care Unit, and was rate controlled with a beta
blocker.  Cardiology was consulted at the time.  A chest
x-ray obtained on [**2190-10-10**] showed probable congestive heart
failure with bilateral pleural effusions, increased in size
since the previous study.  Given the fever and a large ri
