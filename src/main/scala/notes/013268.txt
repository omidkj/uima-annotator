Date of Birth:   [**2058-9-21**]     Sex:  F

Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 77-year-old female
who is complaining of back pain for several days and was
experiencing back pain radiating to the chest.  At some point
the patient had a syncopal episode and fell onto her face.
The patient reports a positive loss of consciousness.  The
patient was found down, bleeding significantly from her face
and was brought immediately to the Emergency Department for
further evaluation.  Patient was normotensive in the 70s and
receiving intravenous fluids when she arrived at the
Emergency Department.  She was intubated in the Emergency
Department using Vecuronium and succinylcholine and was then
evaluated using many radiographic modalities which showed
multiple facial fractures.  The patient was then transferred
to the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Osteoporosis.
2.  Compression fractures.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Fosamax.
2.  Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival her temperature is 100.8,
pulse of 74, blood pressure 146/68, 14, 100%.  The initial
settings for the respirator are IMV at a tidal volume 500,
rate of 14, FIO2 60%, and peak of 5.  In general, intubated,
sedated, paralyzed.  HEENT:  Traumatic facial fractures with
skull depression.  Bilateral tympanic membranes without
blood.  Pupils pinpoint, sluggish to light. Neck:  In collar
without LAD or jugular venous distention.  Carotids 2+.
Rectal:  Guaiac negative, decreased tone.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm;
normal S1 and S2.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended;
no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities: Upper extremity full
range of passive; left lower extremity full range of movement
in passive motion; 1+ pitting edema bilateral knees.
Vasculature:  Right and left carotids, radial femorals, and
dorsalis pedis all 2+.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial lab results showed a white count of
15, hematocrit of 30, and platelet count of 206.  CK was 119,
troponin was less than 0.01.  Urinalysis was negative.
Urinary electrolytes were unremarkable.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transported to
the Trauma SICU, where she was evaluated by Ear, Nose, and
Throat as well as Plastics for the facial fractures and
epistaxis.  The ENT service at this point used balloons to
tamponade the bleeding from the patient's nose.  Multiple
adjustments were made during the Trauma SICU time in order to
control the bleeding.  The initial evaluation by Plastic
Surgery was that the patient would require in-house surgical
repair of the multiple fractures.

After a short stay in the Trauma SICU the patient was then
evaluated by Cardiology, who determined that the patient
either had sick sinus syndrome or another intermittent
arteriovenous block or block below the AV node which
resulted in four- to five-second pauses on telemetry
monitoring.  The Cardiology service felt the best course of
action was to place a pacemaker for the patient.  This
procedure was done without complication.  The patient was
extubated and after a short period of time was sent to the
Trauma Floor for further evaluation and possible surgical
repair of facial fractures.

After a short time on the floor patient was reevaluated by
the Plastic Surgery service, who felt that at this point her
facial fractures were non-operative.  The ENT service also
felt that the epistaxis was under control and that no other
intervention was necessary.  The patient was evaluated by
Speech and Swallow and Physical Therapy, and it was
determined that the patient would leave the hospital to go to
rehab prior to going home to ensure the patient's safety.  At
time of discharge the patient had improving pain symptoms and
was improving overall clinically.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Syncope.
2.  Pacemaker placement.
3.  Multiple facial fractures.
4.  Likely repaired intermittent arteriovenous block or block
below the arteriovenous node.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Percocet 325.
2.  Colace 100 b.i.d.
3.  Erythromycin ointment, one to two drops ophthalmic q.i.d.
4.  Famotidine q. 12 hours.
5.  Bisacodyl 10 mg suppository q. h.s.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Follow up with the Trauma Clinic in one to two weeks.
2.  Follow up with the [**Hospital 3595**] Clinic in one to two weeks.
3.  The patient may also follow up with her outpatient
plastic surgeon, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], for possible repair of the
fractures in the future.
