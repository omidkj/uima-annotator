[**2141-10-3**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
PDA, SVG to OM1 to OM2)
left heart catheterization and coronary angiography


History of Present Illness:
This 49 year old white female with diabetes hypertension
,hypercholesterolemia, and a family history of corornary artery
disease Has had dyspnea for two months.  He presented for
diagnostic catheterization on[**9-29**] and was  found to have three

for revascularization..

s/p ORIF of ankle
Vitiligo

Social History:

Family History:
Father had MI at 39, mother alive, no cardiac disease.

Pertinent Results:
[**2141-9-29**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed severe three vessel disease. The
LMCA was free of angiographically significant stenoses. The had
a 95% proximal stenosis with distal aneurysmal dilatation and a
50% lesion in the mid-vessel; there was an ostial 75% lesion in
the D1 branch.  The LCx had a 99% proximal lesion which involved
the ostium of the OM1; there were large OM2 and OM3 branches
which filled late via left to left collaterals. The RCA was
occluded proximally and filled distally via left to right
collaterals. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a
normotensive central aortic pressure of 122/80mmHg. 3. Left
ventriculography was deferred.
[**2141-9-29**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral, inferior
and lateral hypokinesis. There is mild hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 30%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after she was found to
have severe three vessel coronary artery disease. Upon admission
she was worked up for surgery. Over the next several days she
was medically managed and on [**10-3**]  was brought to the operating
room where she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x 4.
Please see operative report for surgical details.

Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. On the day of surgery she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
 The patient was transferred to the step down unit where she
continued to make excellent progress, showing good strength and
balance with physical therapy.  She did have a prolonged course
of constipation, however, this would resolve prior to discharge.
 By the time of discharge, the patient was ambulating freely,
the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  She was discharged in good condition to home with
VNA services.
