Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1726**] was admitted 24 hours s/p fall onto left side.  He
now complains of severe fatigue and left sided chest pain.  He
was very pale on physical exam and an EKG demonstrated inverted
T waves in the lateral leads.  His hematocrit was 20 and he was
hypotensive to the 90s.  He was immediately resuscitated with
packed RBCs and his color and feelings of fatigue resolved.  A
CTA was obtained to rule out an actively bleeding injury.  It
showed hemoperitoneum around the liver and in the pelvis along
with two splenic artery pseudoaneurysms but no splenic injury.
He immediately went to IR for emoblization of these two
pseudoaneurysms.  He received a total of 4units of packed RBCs
and he hematocrit stablized in the 30s.  He was monitored in the
ICU.  His troponin continued to peak at a level of 1.8.  It is
now trending down.  His cardiologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and with the
EKG findings he was diagnosed as having a NSTEMI, which was
treated medically.  His aspirin was initially held and then
restarted when his hematocrit was stable.  His diet was advanced
and he is having bowel function.  His rib pain is well
controlled and he is not having any chest pain.  He was
transferred to the floor where he continued to remain stable.
He was evaluated by Physical Therapy and will need discharge to
rehab.
