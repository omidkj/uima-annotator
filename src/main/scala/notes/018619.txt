Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary
veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity
size. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (?#). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF=35-40 %). There is moderate anterior
wall and antero-septal hypokinesia. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:

1. Slightly improved global and focal LV systolci function with
background inotropic support.

2. Trace MR and trace TR.

3. Intact aorta

Provisional Findings Impression: GWp SAT [**2101-6-4**] 4:52 PM
PFI:
1. Limited portable renal ultrasound demonstrating no
hydronephrosis, no
nephrolithiasis and no solid renal mass.
2. Right renal artery resistive index measured at 0.85, 0.76,
0.78 and
infrarenal flow with resistive indices 0.77, 0.79 and 0.80.
3. Left renal artery resistive index measured at 0.87, 0.88 with
elevated

indices in
the intrarenal portion appear normal at 0.71, 0.84, and 0.84.
