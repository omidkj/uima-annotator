Admission Date:  [**2120-5-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-6-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2075-7-1**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Syncope.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
male with no prior coronary artery disease transferred to the
CCU for monitoring, status post RCA percutaneous intervention
for an acute inferior MI.  Earlier today, the patient began
to "feel bad" and had an episode of syncope.  He experienced
heartburn-like chest discomfort.

He was taken to an outside hospital where he was found to
have an inferior 5 mm ST segment elevation.  He was given
heparin, aspirin, Integrelin.  He was not administered beta
blockers because his heart rate was in the 60s with PR
prolongation.  The patient was Medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
primary PCI.

PCI was complicated by PCS percutaneous intervention
complicated by an episode of ventricular fibrillation
requiring defibrillation.  The patient was found to have 99%
occlusion of the proximal RCA.  He underwent stenting times
two.

The patient was maintained on dopamine during the procedure.
He was started on IV lidocaine.  Hemodynamics were consistent
with RV infarct physiology with elevated right-sided filling
pressures.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  GERD.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  Prilosec.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for CAD.  The patient's brother
had an MI at age 38.  The patient's father had CABG at age
50.  The patient's grandfather had an MI at an early age.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied the use of tobacco,
alcohol, or drugs.  He is employed as a computer programmer.
He is married.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient
appeared comfortable in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  The pupils were equally round and
reactive to light.  The mucous membranes were moist.  The
oropharynx was clear.  Neck: Supple.  Difficult to assess JVD
as the patient is supine.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen: Soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented
times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.
The examination was otherwise nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA/STUDIES:  The laboratory data on admission
showed a white count of 13, hematocrit 36.1, platelet count
247,000.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.9, chloride 106,
bicarbonate 20, BUN 17, creatinine 0.7, glucose 157.  CK on
admission was 2,884, CK peaked at 3,047, and then trended
downwards.

EKG on admission showed sinus bradycardia, 5 mm ST segment
changes in inferior distribution, rate 53, PR 178, QRS 92, QT
424, QTC 405.

Chest x-ray showed upper zone vascular redistribution but no
overt evidence of pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU for
further management.  As noted above, the patient went for
cardiac catheterization on [**2120-5-31**].  Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right-sided filling pressures
consistent with RV infarct physiology.  The pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was also elevated at 22 mmHg.  The
cardiac output was 6.6 and the cardiac index was 3.2.  Left
ventriculography was not performed.

The left coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system.  The LMCA was normal. The mid LAD had diffuse disease
up to 30%.  The AB groove, left circumflex was free of
hemodynamically significant stenosis.  The OM1 had a 70%
tubular stenotic lesion.  The RCA was a dominant vessel and
had 99% proximal stenotic lesion which was the culprit
lesion.  There was TIMI-II flow distally.

Of note, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation while
inserting the temporary pacemaker in the right ventricle.  He
was promptly defibrillated with 200 joules back to sinus
rhythm.  After crossing the lesion, the patient developed
irregular wide complex tachycardia.  He maintained his blood
pressure and was treated with IV lidocaine bolus followed by
lidocaine drip and he was converted back to sinus rhythm.

Acute inferior myocardial infarction was successfully managed
with primary PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid RCA
using overlapping stents.

The patient was admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.
As his blood pressure allowed, he was started on an ACE
inhibitor and beta blocker.  He was also administered a
statin and aspirin.

The patient continued to complain of heartburn-like symptoms.
He has a long history of GERD.  GI consult was obtained and
it was recommended that the patient be started on a b.i.d.
proton pump inhibitor.

On [**2120-6-3**], the patient underwent an echocardiogram.
There was mild regional left ventricular systolic function
with focal near akinesis of the basal half of the inferior
wall, mild hypokinesis of the basal septum.  The mitral valve
leaflets were structurally normal, mild 1+ mitral
regurgitation is seen.

The patient was eventually transferred to the floor and was
transitioned to once a day medications.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was instructed to return to the ED should he
have further chest pain.
2.  The patient will follow-up with his PCP in two weeks.
3.  The patient will follow-up with his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2257**], in one to two weeks.  His cardiologist was
contact[**Name (NI) **] with discharge instructions.  The patient will
undergo repeat echocardiogram and stress test.
4.  The patient will follow-up with his gastroenterologist in
four to six weeks for further workup of his GERD.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction treated with
primary PCI/stenting.
2.  Hemodynamics consistent with right ventricular infarct
physiology with elevated right-sided and left-sided filling
pressures.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Atorvostatin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
