Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This 73 year-old female with insulin dependent diabetes and
inferior MI in [**2162**] presented with chest pain, jaw pain and
diaphoresis the morning of admission. . This lasted about 30
minutes and resolved with a SL NTG. She visited Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**], her
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was sent to the ED. Of note, her presentation during
her IMI 12 years ago was similar. Per review of chart, she does
have occasional lower chest/epigastric pain which is relieved by
SL NTG or TUMS; this has been thought not to be consistent with
angina.

In the ED, T was 97.6, BP 144/(no diastolic recorded), HR 72, RR
20, 100% RA. She was pain-free but did complain of malaise and
mild nausea. By report, EKG was concerning for isolated ST
elevation in lead III. Labs were significant for hematocrit
35.6, creatinine 1.5 (baseline ), Troponin of 0.60. She was
taken directly to cardiac catherization and found to have three
vessel disease with LMCA 70%, mid-LAD 90%, proximal LCx 90%,
mid-RCA 90%, distal RCA 90% stenoses. No stents were placed and
patient was referred for CABG.

Pertinent Results:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior, septal and
apical hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
Central (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen at a BP of 90/45 mm of
Hg that worsened to 3+ at a BP 130-140/70-80.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS1: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine,
Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Milrinone and Vasopressin. Pt was
being AV paced
1. MR is severe, RV function is mild-moderately depressed, LV
function appears unchanged.
POST-BYPASS2:For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine,
Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Milrinone. Pt was in sinus
tachycardia with frequent APCs.
1. MR was initially trace but worsened to moderate - severe, RV
function is hyperdynamic, LV function is worse with anterior
wall motion abnormalities
POST-BYPASS3: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including Norepinephrine,
Milrinone and Vasopressin.
1. MR is trace.
2. An IABP is present in the descending thoracic aorta with its
end terminating 3 cm below the left subclavian take off
3. LV function is significanly improved.
4. RV is still hyperdynamic.
5. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
6. Inter atrial septum is dynamic

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission she underwent catheterization which revealed
triple vessel disease. She was referred for surgical
intervention.

After 7 day of Plavix washout, she underwent CABG x4 with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]. She weaned from bypass on Milrinone,
vasopressin,Levophed and Propofol.  An IABP was necessary as
well.  She stabilized, the balloon pump was removed on POD 1 and
pressors were weaned over a couple of days.  Diuresis was begun,
she remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint but
required extensive pulmonary toilet and diuresis.  A CT was
placed for a large pleural effusion and she was able to be
extubated on POD 8.   She had recurrent atrial fibrillation,
despite amiodarone and attempts at cardioversion, and Coumadin
was begun. She did convert to sinus rhythm eventually. Beta
blockers were begun, however, they were discontinued on [**2-7**] for
bradycardia, the rhythm remaining sinus.  Coumadin was continued
due to the postoperative atrial fibrillation. her target INR is
2-2.5.

She stabilized and with vigorous diuresis and pulmonary toilet
progressed slowly.  She was neurologically intact.  Physical
therapy worked with her for strength and mobilization.  She was
transferred to a rebabilitation facility for further recovery
prior to eventual return to home.
