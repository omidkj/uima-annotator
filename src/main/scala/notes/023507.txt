Brief Hospital Course:
This pt was admitted on [**5-25**] for his procedure, a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy (see operative note for furthur detail). Pt was
brought to the PACU, where he was noted to be slightly sleepy
but arousable. On the floor, he had no overnight issues on POD0.
On POD1, his diet was advanced from clears to regular, and he
was tolerating PO's well. His pain was only adequately
controlled, and he required breakthrough IV medication
regularly. He had no new issues on POD2 ([**5-27**]).
.
On POD3 ([**5-28**]) , a CXR for decreased oxygen saturations showed a
small right apical pneumothorax, which resolved on a repeat film
the same day. However, the pt was noted to become increasingly
lethargic and confused on the floor on the same day. A CXR was
unremarkable, but his ABG was significant for a decreased oxygen
and raised CO2 level. He was transfered to the ICU for furthur
care. He was started on Levo/Flagyl for potential aspiration
pneumonia (these were stopped on POD6) and a CT Head was done
(=unremarkable). His CT abdomen/pelvis showed fluid in
gallbladder fossa with some foci of air. The patient was
intubated due to increasing lethargy through the evening and
worsening serial ABG's. He was also given doses of lactulose, as
his ammonia level was elevated. He did not have a BM until POD4
([**5-29**]).
.
The patient was clinically monitored on POD4, with serial
neurological exams, serial ABG's. He remained intubated.
Hepatology was consulted in regards to management of his hepatic
encephalopathy. On POD5, pt received 3 doses of acetazolamide.
On POD6 ([**5-31**]), the pt was unable to be extubated as it was felt
he would not be able to support his airway. Propofol was weaned,
and he was extubated in the am of POD7 ([**6-1**]). His ammonia level
was 86. He was started on 3 days of Vitamin K.  He was started
on clears with aspiration precautions on POD8 ([**6-2**]) - in
addition, his aldactone was started to be weaned, and lactulose
continued. He was transfered to the floor on [**6-3**] (POD9).
Overnight, he had an episode of hypoglycemia, and was given an
amp of D50. He was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] the next morning on POD10, and
his RISS was adjusted. He was seen by PT. On [**6-5**], he was again
seen by PT, who cleared him for discharge home. Mental status
improved. VNA services were arranged for home.
