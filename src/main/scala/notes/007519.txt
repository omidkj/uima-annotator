CXR: PA and lateral chest compared to [**6-26**]:

Linear opacification in the right lower lung is probably
subsegmental
atelectasis, more extensive irregular opacification in the left
mid lung is
new since [**6-26**] and could represent bronchopneumonia. The
region of more
dense consolidation in the infrahilar left lower lobe has
cleared and
depression of the left hilus has resolved indicating that this
was
atelectasis. Heart size is normal. There is no pleural effusion.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Blood cultures positive for pansensitive E. coli. Urine culture
growing gram negative rods.

Brief Hospital Course:
For patient's sepsis, she grew 2 bottles of gram negative rods,
one of which speciated to E. coli, which was pansensitive. She
had associated leukocytosis, fever, and tachycardia, consistent
with sepsis. Her UA was positive, and eventually urine culture
grew gram negative rods as well. She was treated initially with
vancomycin and ceftriaxone. This was narrowed to ceftriaxone
alone for which she needs a [**10-5**] day course. A PICC was placed
for antibiotics to be completed at her rehab. Serial blood
cultures were negative. A renal ultrasound was performed to
evaluate for perinephric abscess and this was negative.

She was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR consistent with a
community acquired pneumonia. She was placed on azithromycin as
well for a total five day course to be completed at rehab.

Patient also had a headache, which improved with motrin and
tylenol. She complained of ear pain. Her HEENT and neurological
exam was unremarkable. Her headache was felt to be secondary to
neck spasms, and she was given warm packs. Physical therapy
evaluated her and felt that she should have physical therapy as
an outpatient.

Patient was felt to be in acute alcohol withdrawal as well. She
was given valium, and then switched to lorazepam given her
history of liver diseases. She was given a MVI/thiamine/folate,
and was evaluated by social work. Her CIWA was discontinued one
day before discharge.

She was pancytopenic, thought to be from marrow suppression from
alcohol use. She did not require any blood transfusions.

For her alcoholic cirrhosis, she was not encephalopathic during
her admission. She was given lactulose. Her breast cancer was
stable, and will need to be followed up as an outpatient.

Her code status was made DNR/DNI.
