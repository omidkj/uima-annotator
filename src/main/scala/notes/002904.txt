Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Flexible bronchoscopy [**2102-4-8**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 79145**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of HTN,
DM, ?chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia who was
transferred from the ED intubated after presenting with hypoxia
and tachypnea.  She was in her usual state of health until two
days ago when she began experiencing a nonproductive cough and
dyspnea.  Her symptoms worsened and her [**Age over 90 **] and son-in-law,
whom she lives with, brought her to the ED.  On presentation,
her VS were 98.1 74 154/82 18 79%RA.  She appeared to be in
acute respiratory distress, with increased work of breathing.
She was placed on a NRB and was satting in the 80-85% range, and
a CXR demonstrated left sided consolidation.  She was started on
levofloxacin and ceftriaxone and intubated because of worsening
tachypnea and hypoxia and then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Per discussion with her [**Hospital Unit Name **], the patient has not received a
flu shot this year but did receive the pneumovax about five
years ago.  She has no sick contacts and has no recent hospital
or nursing home exposure.  She last had pneumonia one year ago
and was treated as an outpatient.

Review of systems is otherwise negative for fevers, chills,
arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and chest pain.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 22114**] has chronic constipation at baseline.

Past Medical History:
HTN
DM2 (diet controlled)
?Chronic aspiration
Alzheimer's dementia
Breast cancer (diagnosed seven years ago)
Lower back pressure ulcer

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 22114**] is Russian speaking and wheelchair bound at
baseline.  She lives with her [**Known lastname **] and son-in-law in [**Location (un) 14307**] and moved to the United States from [**Country 532**] five years ago.
 She does not smoke or drink alcohol.  She has VNA services for
dressing changes for her lower back pressure ulcer.  She has

Studies:
ECHO: EF 70-75%, Preserved regional and global biventricular
systolic function. Severe pulmonary hypertension. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild to moderate functional mitral
stenosis from mitral annular calcification. Mild to moderate
tricuspid regurgitation.

RUQ US: 1. Limited evaluation of gallbladder without evidence of
cholelithiasis. 2. Very limited evaluation of the liver. Mass
and hepatic calcifications are better evaluated on concurrent CT
abdomen. 3. Splenic calcifications suggest prior granulomatous
disease.

CTA CHEST: 1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Large to moderate amount of bilateral pleural effusion
associated with
adjacent atelectasis.
3. Multifocal areas of consolidation of right upper lobe, right
middle lobe,
and both lower lobes are probably related to pneumonia.
4. Known mass in left axilla that seems to be invading the left
breast.
5. Multiple calcified nodules in the liver and spleen suggest
prior
granulomatous exposure.
6. Hypodense mass in right hepatic lobe. Dedicated abdominal
evaluation is
suggested.

CXR [**2102-4-13**]: There is interval development of new whiteout of
right hemithorax with right mediastinal shift, finding
consistent with a complete atelectasis of the right lung. Given
the rapid development it is consistent with a mucus plug
aspiration. The left lung aeration is preserved and demonstrates
the presence of a mild to moderate pulmonary edema. A left
pleural effusion is present.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 22114**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of HTN, DM,
?chronic aspiration, and Alzheimer's dementia who was
transferred from the ED intubated after presenting with hypoxia
and tachypnea.

#. Respiratory failure/Pneumonia:  Patient presented with
hypoxia and tachypnea and chest radiograph c/w a LUL
consolidation pneumonia.  She was started on
ceftriazone/azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia on
presentation.  On her second hospital day her chest radiograph
changed significantly with the consolidation in her left upper
lobe generally resolving suggesting this was more consistent
with mucous plugging and volume loss.  She went on to have a CT
scan that showed multifocal pneumonia as well as probable
pulmonary edema with large bilateral pleural effusions.  She was
transiently intubated with reexpansion of a previously collapsed
upper lobe.
Given that her pulmonary edema and large pleural effusions were
likely contributing to her volume loss and respiratory
compromise an attempt was made to diurese with furosemide
boluses, to which she responded well with decreasing oxygen
requirements, down to 4L NC at dischage.  Pt also had
intermittent lobar collapse, thought to be due to mucous
plugging and aspirating of secretions. She generally responded
to deep suctioning but was unable to effectively cough to clear
her own secretions.

#. Hypertension:  The patient has severe and labile hypertension
and was continued  on an aggressive anti-hypertensive regimen at
home including beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) 14595**]-1 [**First Name3 (LF) 7005**], CCB, and ACE
inhibitor.  In the setting of diuresis, pt was intermittently
hypotensive requiring fluid boluses. She also at times was
hypertensive, requiring prn doses of hydralazine.

#. Alzheimer's dementia:  The patient has severe dementia at
baseline, but is on no treatment for this at home.  As of
extubation her mental status was at baseline (opens eyes to
voice but does not interact or follow commands).

#. Breast cancer:  The patient has a necrotic mass in her left
axilla of locally advanced breast cancer.  No aggressive
therapies are being pursued.

# Lower back pressure ulcer:  Care per wound nurse
recommendaitons

#. DM2: Finger sticks were monitored QID and treated with ISS.

#. Nutrition: Given pt's repeated aspiration, pt was fed via
NGT.
