RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2181-7-6**] 4:11 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:

1) No significant interval change in extensive, ill-defined,
diffuse nodular and patchy opacities which are predominantly
distributed within both upper lobes. These findings in this
neutropenic patient are most suggestive of an infectious
etiology with invasive aspergillosis high on the differential.
The radiographic differential diagnosis also includes other
fungal infections, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 34832**] emboli, cryptogenic organizing
pneumonitis, and less likely, vasculitis.

2) Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

3) Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly decreased in size
since the prior study.

4) Tiny non-obstructing right renal calculus.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Approved: SAT [**2181-7-7**] 2:23 PM

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2181-7-3**]

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2181-6-25**],
there is no significant change.

No vegetations seen (but cannot exclude).

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2181-6-30**] 10:17 AM

IMPRESSION:

1. Multiple, ill-defined, irregularly marginated pulmonary
nodules throughout both lungs, predominantly within both upper
lobes, which have not significantly changed since the prior
study. These findings, again, are most suggestive of an
infectious etiology. The diffuse distribution of these lesions
less likely favors [**Month/Day/Year 34832**] emboli.

2. Continued bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation with small
bilateral pleural effusions,
