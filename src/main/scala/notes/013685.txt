Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left femoral line placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7493**] is a 64yo man with HIV, hepatitis C, ESRD on HD, DM2,
who lives at a nursing home, where he was found to have mental
status canges this morning being minimally responsive. He was
sent to our ER where he was found to have a FS of 14. (By report
FS at the nursing home was 278). He was given 1 amp D50 with
good effect, and Narcan x 1 with reportedly "better effect." The
patient was kept on a D5 drip to maintain his FS in the 70s in
the ER. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for frequent FS monitoring.
Vital signs were stable in the ER. L femoral line was placed on
arrival. CXR showed likely aspiration or widespread pneumonia
and the pt was started on vancomycin/Zosyn/azithro. MICU course
also notable for sinus tachycardia, improved with hydration and
addition of a beta-blocker. Troponin of 0.30 is below levels
checked early in [**Month (only) 547**] of 0.35.
.
The patient has no complaints at present except for his chronic
upper and lower extremity pain which he says has not been
treated at his nursing home. He states that he asked a friend to
bring him two [**Name (NI) 94991**] yesterday but claims he did not take
these. He also has many complaints about his treatment at his
nursing home, where he thinks that he is poorly cared for and
that they do not like him because he "complains too much." He
believes he has gotten his usual doses of insulin only and
denies any oral hypoglycemics or new pills which looked
different to him. He states that he currently feels at his new
baseline.
.
Pt has HD on TThSa through R femoral line. He is on coumadin for
history of clotted HD lines.

Pertinent Results:
[**2125-5-7**] CXR: Left lung consolidation has improved substantially
over nine hours, indicating this was most likely asymmetric
edema. Lungs are otherwise clear. Lateral aspect of the right
lower hemithorax is excluded from the examination, but the
remaining pleural surfaces are normal. Large hiatus hernia
noted.
.
[**2125-5-8**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia @ 106. Low limb lead QRS voltage.
Early precordial QRS transition. Modest non-specific right
precordial/anterior T wave changes. Prolonged QTc interval.
These findings are non-specific but clinical correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2125-4-11**] sinus
tachycardia is present, further T wave changes are seen and QTc
interval appears prolonged.
.
[**2125-5-9**] CXR: The heart size is large but unchanged in size. The
large hiatal hernia is again demonstrated. The lungs are clear
with no new infiltrates. The pleural surfaces are smooth and
there is no sizable pleural effusion.
.
[**2125-5-10**] ECG: Sinus rhythm
Early precordial QRS transition - is nonspecific
Diffuse nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities with prolonged Q-Tc
interval -
cannot exclude in part drug/metabolic/electrolyte effect
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2125-5-8**], sinus tachycardia absent,
further ST-T wave abnormalities seen and Q-Tc interval is
prolonged
.
[**2125-5-11**] CHEST U.S. RIGHT: Partial interval resolution of fluid
collection in the right upper chest with residual 4.8 x 0.9 x
1.0 cm fluid collection of mixed echogenicity, which could
represent hematoma.
