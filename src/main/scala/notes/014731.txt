Service:  MICU

ADDENDUM:  Please refer to the previously dictated Discharge
Summary for previous hospital course and Medical Intensive
Care Unit dated [**2169-9-19**].

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):

1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient required a
further 2-day stay in the Medical Intensive Care Unit given
the fact that she was awaiting a rehabilitation facility bed.
Her respiratory failure issues remained the same.  She was
maintained on a pressure support of 13 and 10.

On the day prior to discharge, she required an increased
amount of pressure support to 15 and 7 with tidal volumes of
300s to 350s.  The goal was to decrease in order to improve
her oxygenation status.  She will require further weaning at
the rehabilitation facility after discharge.

2.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
clindamycin and Zosyn.  The Zosyn was discontinued on the day
prior to discharge secondary to evolution of a rash that she
started to have on her buttocks which was erythematous,
maculopapular, and pustular as well.  This was thought to be
due to a drug rash given the fact that was previously on
Unasyn and had a similar rash.

Also, the clindamycin was discontinued after 19 days of
treatment given the fact that she was continuing to spike
fevers and her pneumonia issues appeared to be resolved.
Cultures obtained all have been negative.

3.  FEVER ISSUES:  Likely thought to be due to continued drug
fever and drug rash. Zosyn was discontinued (as above)
secondary to rash.  Clindamycin was finished after a 19-day
course.  The plan was that if she re-spiked to re-tap her
bilateral effusions.  A human immunodeficiency virus test was
performed and was negative.  Fungal cultures and other blood
cultures remained negative.

4.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient's anemia issues resolved with
epoetin alfa and iron supplementation.

5.  RASH ISSUES:  The patient evolved a rash on the day prior
to discharge.  It was erythematous and maculopapular
spreading from her buttocks up to her right spinal process.
This was likely due to a drug rash (as above) secondary to
Zosyn given the fact that she had a previous rash on Unasyn.
Sarna cream was prescribed, and a Dermatology consultation
was obtained.  Evaluation was still pending at the time of
this dictation.

6.  PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The patient had a Psychiatry
consultation and evaluation while in house.  They recommended
decreasing the Zyprexa Zydis to 5 mg by mouth once per day
from 10 mg and to decrease the frequency of the Ativan by
mouth which was changed from q.4h. to q.6h.   The patient was
maintained on a Fentanyl patch for a history of narcotic
abuse.  No other issues were appreciable at this time.

NOTE:  Please refer to the previously dictated Discharge
Summary for all further information.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Subcutaneous heparin 6000 units subcutaneously q.8h.
2.  Fentanyl patch 0.025-mg transdermally per hour q.72h.
3.  Olanzapine 5 mg by mouth q.h.s.
4.  Lorazepam 2 mg by mouth q.6h.
5.  Ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth three times per day.
6.  Epoetin alfa 5000 units subcutaneously three times per
week (on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday).
7.  Folic acid 1 mg by mouth every day.
8.  Ranitidine 150 mg by mouth once per day.
9.  Thiamine 100 mg by mouth once per day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to be
discharged to a rehabilitation facility today and will
require follow up with her primary care physician after
discharge from the rehabilitation facility.
