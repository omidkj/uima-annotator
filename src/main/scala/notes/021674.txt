History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 78 year old widowed white male with hx of autoimmune
recurrent pleural effusions (bilat.) for which he takes daily

CT CHEST:
CT CHEST W/IV CONTRAST: There are moderate bilateral pleural
effusions, right greater than left. There are no pericardial
effusions. There are coronary artery calcifications. The airways
are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.

There is a 1.8 x 3.0 cm cystic structure in the left lobe of the
thyroid. There is a small focus of low attenuation in the right
lobe of the thyroid gland. An ultrasound study is recommended
for further characterization of these findings.

There are small prevascular, and precarinal lymph nodes, as well
as axillary lymph nodes, none of which meet criteria for
pathologic enlargement. There is a small left hilar lymph node,
measuring up to 1.3 cm in diameter. There is a smaller right
sided hilar node as well.

There are small calcified pulmonary nodules likely representing
calcified granulomas measuring up to 5 mm in the right middle
lobe, and 2-3 mm in the lingula. There is a small peripherally
based non-calcified nodule in the right upper lobe measuring up
to 5 mm in diameter. Comparison with prior studies if available
would be useful. Otherwise, a followup study in three months is
recommended to document stability.

There are calcifications seen in the descending thoracic aorta.
The osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic
lesions.

IMPRESSION
1. Bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Small nodule in the right upper lobe, for which either
follow/up studies to document stability, or else, a follow/up
study in three months is recommended.
3. Small left hilar lymph node measuring 1.3 cm in diameter.
4. Cystic bilateral thyroid lesions for which an ultrasound is
recommended for further evaluation.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

The rhythm appears to be junctional (no A wave on transmitral
Doppler).
This study was compared to the report of the prior study (tape
not available)
of [**2119-11-17**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild
global LV
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic LV systolic function depressed given the
severity of
valvular regurgitation.]

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal inferior
- hypo;

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild
AS. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Mild PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2113**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations,
the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and
echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left and the right atrium are moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis with more severe hypokinesis of the
basal
inferior wall. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may
be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There
is mild aortic valve stenosis with mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild global and regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Compared with the prior study of [**11-6**], left ventricular
systolic function is
now depressed. the severity of aortic stenosis and mitral
regurgitation are
slightly worse. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is
now present.
Based on [**2113**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented with SOB and cough on [**1-4**] determined to
be congestive heart failure and pneumonia with subsequent
respiratory failure requiring intubation and elevated troponin
(0.57 which trended to 0.9 before falling) found to be a NSTEMI
by EKG.  CXR revealed CHF bilat. with RLL atelectasis.  His
pneumonia was treated with a 5 day course of Azithromycin and a
10 day course of third generation cephalosporin which would be
complete [**2122-1-15**].

In the MICU, Tmax spiked to 102 but resp. status improved.
Creat. spiked to 1.9.  Hematocrit dropped as well but rebounded
without requiring transfusion and la
