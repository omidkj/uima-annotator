[**2122-3-1**] Abdominal CT
Large pneumoperitoneum, free intraperitoneal fluid, and biliary
gas. The constellation of findings raises concern for duodenal
ulcer
perforation. Dilated loops of small bowel indicate presence of
an ileus in the setting of acute abdominal process.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and taken urgently to the OR for an
exploratory laparotomy. He was found to have a perforated
duodenum and underwent a pyloric exclusion. He remained on a
ventilator and was transferred post-operatively to the SICU on
pressors for hemodynamic support. Later on POD0, a bladder
pressure could not be obtained due to inability to irrigate the
bladder and was increasingly difficult to ventilate, so the
decision was made to open the abdomen in order to prevent
abdominal compartment syndrome. He continued to require
increasing pressor support. His blood cultures were positive for
gram negative rods and was coverage with broad spectrum
antibiotics. On POD1, he succumbed to overwhelming septic shock
after maximal pressor (including epinephrine) and ventilatory
support. His family was informed of the prognosis and made the
decision to change his status to comfort measures only. He
expired quickly after pressors were withdrawn.
