Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4095**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive urgency/transfer for epidural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F (Haitian Creole speaking) w/ h/o dementia, HTN, CHF, AF
on digoxin (not on warfarin) presented to OSH from nursing
facillity after unwitnessed fall, found to have intracranial
hemorrhage at OSH and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosx eval.
.
Per daughter, patient in her usual state of health w/ baseline
delerium (A&Ox1 - self, auditory hallucinations, and poor po) on
Sunday when she visited her in nursing facillity.  Patient was
w/o complaints, and had no n/v, d/c, cp, sob.  At 2AM of day
admission, pt was found down at her nursing facillity after
unwitnessed fall.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] where head CT
showed 4mm acute epidural hemorrhage vs subdural hemorrhage
w/very mild midline shift as well as suspected L eye globe
hemorrhage. Pt recv'd ativan 1mg for CT scan. CT c-spine
negative.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neuro [**Doctor First Name **] eval.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  Temp: 97.6 HR: 80 BP: 178/80 Resp:
20 O2 Sat: 98. A repeat CT Head demonstrated no interval change
in what was determined to be an epidural hematoma. The patient
was started on nicardipine gtt with target goal of SBP<140.  The
nicardipine gtt was stop due to hypotension with SBP in the
90's.  Then the patient was transfered to the MICU for BP
monitoring and q4hr neuro check given epidural hematoma.

On arrival to the MICU, the initial vitals were 96.2 80 152/82
16 99% on RA.  The patient was given hydralazine 10 IV and
responded with a BP in the 120's/50's.

CXR [**2180-8-29**]:
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. The
patient is rotated to the right. Given this, no focal
consolidation is seen.  There is minimal blunting of the left
costophrenic angle which is likely positional, although a trace
effusion cannot be entirely excluded. No evidence of
pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.
 The aorta is calcified and tortuous. No displaced fracture is
seen.
.
IMPRESSION: No focal consolidation. Minimal blunting of the left

costophrenic angle is likely positional, although a very trace
pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. Mild cardiomegaly.
.
CT SINUS/MAXILLARY/MANDIBLE  [**2180-8-29**]:
.
FINDINGS: There is extensive soft tissue swelling of the left
periorbital and preseptal region. The left globe contour is
intact with no CT evidence of rupture, but ophthalmology
examination is advised. There is hemorrhage seen within the left
globe both in the anterior and posterior [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]. Vitreous
hemorrhage is seen contiguous with the anterior chamber
hemorrhage. The hemorrhage within the posterior chamber along
the posterior aspect of the globe likely represents choroidal
hemorrhage/detachment as the hemorrhage is seen to cross the
optic nerve. No retrobulbar hematoma is seen. Osseous structures
of the orbits appear intact with no fluid or blood seen within
the paranasal air spaces. Minimal mucosal thickening is seen in
the left maxillary sinus. The cribriform plate is intact.
.
IMPRESSION:
1) Hemorrhage in the anterior and posterior [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] of the left
globe.
Vitreous hemorrhage is seen contiguous with the anterior chamber
hemorrhage.  Posterior hyperdensity most likely represents
choroidal hemorrhage/detachment.
Globe appears intact, but direct examination advised.
2) Left periorbital and preseptal soft tissue swelling/hematoma
without
underlying fracture seen. No retrobulbar hematoma.
.
FINDINGS: There is a small 4-mm epidural hematoma seen in the
left
occipitoparietal region with possible subdural hematoma
extension, unchanged from previous outside hospital study. There
are periventricular white matter hypodensities most likely
representing chronic small vessel disease. There is mild
prominence of the ventricles but the sulci are of normal size
and configuration. There is no shift of normally midline
structures.
.
There is extensive soft tissue swelling in the left periorbital
and preseptal region. There is hemorrhage seen within the left
globe in the posterior and anterior chamber as well as the
vitreous. The posterior hemorrhage most likely represents
choroidal hemorrhage. No fractures are observed in the orbital
structure. There is no hemorrhage seen within the orbits or
evidence of extraocular muscle entrapment.
.
There is opacification of several ethmoid air cells on the left,
which most likely represent inflammatory changes; however,
hemorrhage cannot be ruled out. If there is clinical concern for
hemorrhage, temporal bone CT is recommended.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. 4-mm epidural hematoma in the left parieto-occipital region
with possible adjacent subdural hematoma.
2. Hemorrhage in the left globe both in the posterior and
anterior [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]. Posterior hemorrhage most likely represents
choroidal hemorrhage. Globe appears intact. See dedicated
maxillofacial CT for further details.
3. Opacification of a very few left mastoid air cells, most
likely representing inflammation; however, but in the setting of
trauma, hemorrhage and a nondisplaced temporal bone fracture can
not be excluded. If there is clinical concern, temporal bone CT
can be obtained.
