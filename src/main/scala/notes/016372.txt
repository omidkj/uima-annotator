History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 y.o male with h.o metastatic melanoma who presents
with "I couldn't walk", noticed to be tachypneic in the ED,
underwent CTA found to have multiple PE's. Pt reports he came to
the ED as he was too weak to walk. Pt also endorses dysuria for
a few days. Otherwise denies f/c/uri/cough, headache, blurred
vision, dizziness, CP/palp, SOB, abd pain/n/v/d/c/melena/brbpr,
dysuria, hematuria, joint pain, skin rash, paresthesias,
bowel/bladder incontinence.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt found to be tachypneic, RR ~35, CTA found PE, head
CT found stable R.frontal lesion. PT's neurooncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
was [**Name (NI) 653**], who felt that given clinical situation, heparin
IV could be initiated.

Past Medical History:
PER OMR-
Mr. [**Known lastname 64756**] had a biopsy of a 2-mm Clark'slevel IV melanoma in
the right ear with no ulceration one mitosis per square mm in
12/[**2163**]. During his evaluation, he was found to have a secondary

primary on his upper back that was 0.6 mm [**Doctor Last Name 10834**] level III with

no evidence of ulceration. He underwent wide local excision of
the right ear and back at the same time as well as a sentinel
lymph node biopsy from the right ear lesion in [**2-/2164**] with no
evidence of residual melanoma at the primary site or in the
sentinel lymph nodes. In [**8-/2165**], he developed a soft tissue
nodule on his right neck just inferior to the scar. He underwent

right parotidectomy and facial nerve sparing and right cervical
node dissection. Pathology revealed 9 of 57 cervical
lymph nodes positive of melanoma with extracapsular extension.
The salivary gland had 4 of 9 nodes showing evidence of
extracapsular extension as well. He underwent radiation therapy

to the right neck and facial region completing in early 10/[**2165**].

He began adjuvant interferon therapy on [**2166-1-8**]. His
interferon therapy was discontinued after five weeks due to
mental status change and declining performance status. He had a

needle biopsy of a lump on the right mid-back in end of [**Month (only) **]
[**2166**] that revealed malignant cells. CT torso [**2166-8-18**] showed
concerning metastatic lesion in the region of the left kidney as

well as a new right hilar adenopathy measuring approximately 1.8

cm in greatest axial dimension concering for metastatic spread.

[**2166-12-21**] CT head without contrast: IMPRESSION: Overall interval
decrease in size of the known metastatic right frontal lesion
with decreased surrounding edema. Other lesions not well defined
on this non- contrast study, MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is much more
sensitive.

[**2166-12-21**] CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with acute pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval increase in size of the right hilar lymphadenopathy.

3. Right upper lobe opacity is new, and may represent an
infarction,
alternatively, this could be seen in the setting of infection.
4. Stable appearance of noncalcified right lower lobe pulmonary
nodule.
Evaluation for small nodule is limited by motion artifact.
5. Stable appearance of a soft tissue adjacent to or arising
from the inter polar left kidney. Further imaging/ CT abdomen
may be performed to assess.

[**2166-12-22**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-21**],
there is little change.  Continued prominence of the cardiac
silhouette, some of which may be related to the poor
inspiration. No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular
congestion.

[**2166-12-22**] LENI: IMPRESSION: Normal bilateral lower extremity
ultrasound examination. No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: This is a 71 y.o male with h.o metastatic
melanoma, who presents with difficulty ambulating found to have
multiple PE's.
.
#pulmonary embolism-Discovered at admission after found to be
tachypic. Likely secondary to malignancy. Pt notes inability to
speak in full sentences for 6 weeks. Family reports noticing
some SOB in the days prior to admission.  It is unclear whether
the PE caused significant weakness or if his weakness if [**3-15**] the
Salmonella infection and chronic PE's were incidently
discovered. Pros/Cons regarding anticoagulation were weighed. Pt
has known melanoma brain mets which have a proclivity to become
hemorrhagic. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**], felt that in the setting of SOB/02
requirement, heparin should be started without a bolus. Upon
leaving the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was transitioned to lovenox without
incident. The Lovenox goal was arbitrarily set at .75mg/kg [**Hospital1 **],
which was rounded down to 60mg q12h to fit existing syringe
dosing.   The patient was continued on nebs prn for wheezing.
The pt remained sating well no RA.
.
#difficulty ambulating-pt denies falls. Reports that on the day
of admit, felt weak and unsteady. Denies bowel/bladder
incontinence. Likely a result of Salmonella infection tipping
this gentlemen with low energy resevres [**3-15**] underlying dx. Pt
also has an underlying tremor. Pt/ot consulted who recommended
rehabilitation facility. Continue intense PT.
.
# Salmonella infection: Pt had 2 episodes of diarrhea prior to
admission. Reports eating fair amount of scrambed eggs. Denies
contact with lizards or sick contacts. Pt had worsening diarrhea
in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] which had resolved by time of tra
