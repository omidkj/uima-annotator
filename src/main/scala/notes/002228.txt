HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old man
who came to the [**Hospital1 69**] on the
[**4-14**] for cardiac catheterization.  During that
catheterization, he was found to have a patent LIMA, LAD and
SBG times two and patent stents.  After catheterization, further
patient had history of hematuria and pneumaturia with a
possible anastomosis between his GI and urinary system.  He
had seen a doctor on the [**3-26**] for this problem and
his INR was found to be 4 so his Coumadin was held, however
the next day he noted some red urine with clots.  Over the
week prior to admission, he had complaints of pain with
urination and bloody urination.
On the 28th, the day prior to admission, the patient noted
air in his urine and also flecks of darker material and pus
or white material in the urine.  The patient denied any fever
or chills.  Had not had any changes in his bowel movements.
He has no history of urinary tract infections.  He does have
a history of positive renal stones and has had ureteral
stents placed 10 years prior to admission.  The patient had
some nausea, but no vomiting prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission blood pressure in the 100
to 110 range over 60s.  Temperature 98.3 F, heart rate 76 and
respiratory rate of 20.  In general the patient was alert and
oriented times three in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  The patient had pupils that were
equal, round and reactive bilaterally.  Extraocular motions
were intact.  Chest:  He had a few rales at the left

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white count of
15 with 71 polys, no bands, hematocrit of 40.  His Chem-7 was
essentially normal.  His urine showed gross infection with
greater than 1,000 white blood cells, large blood, many
bacteria.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
and started on antibiotic treatment for his urinary tract
infection which was suspected to be entero vesicular fistula
given his history of diverticulitis.  Urology was consulted.
A CT Scan just after admission showed sigmoid diverticulitis
with sigmoid vesicular fistulas.  The patient was started on
Levaquin, Flagyl and Ampicillin.  Due to the extremely long
hospitalization and transfer to the Surgical Service and then
back to the Medical Service, the rest of the dictation
summary will be by system to give a concise review of
hospital occurrences.

1.  GI / GU SYSTEMS:  As mentioned in the HPI, the patient
was admitted with a enterovesical fistula and started on
triple antibiotic coverage.  The patient was seen by the
Urology Department and Surgical Colorectal Surgery Department
as well as by Infectious Disease.  Initially, it was deemed
more appropriate to treat the patient with medial therapy
i.e. triple antibiotic coverage to decrease inflammation in
the colon and bladder area.  He had a Foley catheter placed
which on several occasions was clogged and had to be
readjusted.

Following medical treatment, the patient was transferred to
the Surgical Service on [**11-23**] where he underwent a
diverting colostomy with Hartmann pouch of the distal segment
and his bladder was oversewn.  A suprapubic catheter was
placed.  Due to the contaminated nature of the surgery and
the fact that the patient had an abscess within his abdominal
cavity as shown on CT Scan, only his fascia was closed and
the skin and subcuticular layer were left open to heel by
secondary intention.  Please refer to the [**11-23**]
operative note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**] for full details of the surgery.

Following surgery, the patient underwent a complicated
medical course with a prolong stay in the SICU and eventual
transfer to the floor.  It should be noted that the patient's
preoperative mortality morbidity was estimated to be 50% due to
his
complicating medical conditions.

As the patient improved, he was transferred back to the
Medical Service on [**11-30**] for fine tuning of his
urine, endocrine and cardiac systems.  He was maintained on
triple coverage antibiotics of Flagyl, Levaquin and
Vancomycin until [**12-6**] when there were no further
signs of infection and patient was doing well clinically.  It
should be noted that postoperatively, the patient had some
hypotension and there was fear of sepsis so he was pan
cultured and aggressive antibiotic treatment continued,
however all of the cultures with exception of urine culture
returned as negative.

On [**12-6**], the patient had an abdominal CT Scan which
showed no abscess within the abdominal cavity and only the
open abdominal wound left from surgery.  The patient will
have the suprapubic catheter in place until follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1888**].  He gradually developed stools through his ostomy
and good gas flow.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned before, the patient has
extensive cardiac disease.  While in the hospital, he was
monitored on Telemetry which showed no significant events.
His pacer defibrillator was interrogated after surgery and
was found to be in normal working order.  He was kept on
Carvedilol for blood pressure and cardiac status.  His
aspirin was restarted during hospital stay after surgery and
Coumadin was restarted for the patient's atrial fibrillation.
During the time of surgery and during the postoperative
period, the patient was anticoagulated with heparin.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient has an extensive tobacco history.
During his hospitalization his pulse oximetry saturations
were within normal limits.  There was some mild congestive
heart failure clinically on x-rays due to his fluid status,
but this was corrected with dialysis.  It should also be the
patient had a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
positive nasal swab for which he was placed on isolation.

4.  RENAL:  As mentioned, the patient has end stage renal
disease and he receives tri-weekly hemodialysis.  In the GI /
GU section the patient's enterovesical fistula was discussed.
During the week of [**11-26**], the patient's fluid status
was deemed to be that he was retaining quite a bit of fluid.
He underwent daily dialysis for several days during which 2
to 3 kilograms were taken off per day.  This gra
