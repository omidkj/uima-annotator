1. Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4, left internal
    mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 74 year old male with PMH of HTN,
hyperlipidemia, previous coronary stenting, and angina who
complains of chest pain. At 10pm, while eating dinner pt felt
sharp substernal chest pain ([**6-8**]) that lasted 1min before it
resolved with nitro. Pt reports pain radiated to back during
this time also. He denies any SOB w/ this episode. No n/v. No
arm or back pain. No diaphoresis. Similar episode happened last
week and the pt went into the ED at an OSH for this also.
The pt was admitted to overnight obs in the ED considering
unchanged EKG and negative trop/CKMB. Pt has received aspirin in
the ED yesterday. Repeat EKG this AM, showed T waves flipped.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING

Cardiac Cath ([**5-4**]):  1) Selective angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated significant two-vessel coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA had 60% distal vessel stenosis,
similar to its appearance on [**2121-3-23**].  The LAD had 99% in-stent
restenosis at the recent angioplasty site, with high-grade
stenosis of the ostium of the diagonal branch as well.  The
dominant LCx had moderate disease.  The non-dominant RCA was
known to have 100% proximal occlusion from the previous
catheterization on [**2121-1-23**].
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic arterial
normotension,
with a central aortic pressure of 121/65 mmHg.
3) The right common femoral artery arteriotomy site was
Angiosealed
after the case.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe in-stent restenosis of the proximal LAD, involving the
ostium
of the diagonal branch.
2. Cardiac surgery aware and will evaluate the patient.

EKG [**5-3**]: II, III, aVF, V3-6 shows new inverted T waves
EKG ([**5-4**]): showed ST elevation in lead V2 w/ ST depression in
leads V5/V6 and I
.
[**2121-5-6**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque . There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Transiently severely depressed LV and RV systolci function.
Responsded to epinephrine infusion with global [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular
function improving to baseline.

2. There is mild TR now and mild MR.

3. No other change

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL COURSE:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 74M w/ HTN, HLP, former tobacco use,
obesity, CAD, s/p PTCI with bare metal stent to proximal LAD on
[**2121-1-23**] (100% RCA occlusion, 60% distal Left main, high grade
LAD lesion with negative flow velocity of left main c/b
occlusion of left diagonal) p/w unstable angina. Chest pain
responded rapidly to nitro making MI less likely especially
given negative troponins x2 upon presentation. Initial EKG
showed no changes, but EKG in ED the morning after showed
inverted T waves in several leads. Planned to treat UA medically
and cath on Monday. On [**5-4**], the pt experienced multiple episodes
of CP in the morning. All relieved w/ SLNG. Trops cont be neg,
but ST elevation seen on EKG in lead V2 w/ ST depression in
V5/6.
.
# CORONARIES: pt w/ BMS to prox LAD s/p recent angioplasty, p/w
likely UA. His medications were optimized by continuing asa 325
daily, imdur 30mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 20mg daily, atenolol 25mg
daily, plavix 75mg daily. simva 40mg daily was changed to
atorvastatin 80mg daily although to note LDL is at goal at 49,
but HDL low at 24. The pt was started on a heparin gtt. The pt
w/ more episodes of angina, all w/ exertion on [**5-4**]. Relieved w/
SLNG, but started on nitro drip given multiple episodes. trop
neg x6, but concern for ischemia given changes in EKG. pt taken
to cath which showed restenosis of prox LAD. CSurg was contact[**Name (NI) **]
for eval for CABG. Plavix was stopped w/ last dose on [**5-4**]. BP
was regulated on nitro gtt.

Pt transferred off Cards service on [**5-6**] after pt sent for CABG.

SURGICAL COURSE:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2121-5-6**] where
the patient underwent urgent CABG x 4 with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  He was subsequently re-intubated on POD 1
and weaned and extubated shortly after.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  Foley was
re-inserted for urinary retention.  He will be discharged with
the Foley for a void trial in the future.  Th
