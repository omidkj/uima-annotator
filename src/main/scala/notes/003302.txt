Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 68 yo woman with PMH of tobacco use, RA presents to ED
today with chest pain, found to have inferior/posterior STEMI
with RV involvement.  Patient was in her USOH until 2 week PTA
when developed sub-sternal chest pressure w/ radiation down both
arms while raking leaves.  She rested after onset of pain, and
pain resolved after 5 minutes.  1 week prior to presentation,
patient again experienced these sxs after having "an emotional
phone call".  Again, pt rested and pain resolved after [**10-29**]
minutes, but she was nervous about pain, so presented to [**Hospital 2538**] on [**2102-4-3**].  At that time she was r/o for MI with
negative cardiac enzymes and underwent stress ECHO that was
negative after going 7 minutes on [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, achieving 91%
of maximum HR.  Therefore patient was discharged.  She then
again had a similar episode of this pain last night, associated
w/ N/V x 1, but then was able to fall asleep without sxs.
Pt then reports this evening, developed same type of substernal
chest pressure, but more severe.  Patient states she was baking
pies when had onset of [**9-24**] sub-sternal chest pressure, +
radiation down arms b/l, associated with N/V x 1 and
diaphoresis.  Onset of sxs was 7:30pm.  Therefore pt called
ambulanace and presented to [**Hospital1 18**].
On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was initially given NTG gtt and
morphine.  Found to have EKG with ST elevations in inferior
leads with reciprical ST depressions in aVL, V1-V2.  R sided EKG
demonstrated ST elevations in V4, indicating RV involvment.
Therefore nitro gtt d/ced, started on IVF - received a total of
1 L fluid bolus in ED.  Also started on heparin gtt, integrilin
gtt, and given plavix load 300mg x 1 in ED.  Also received
benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid prior to cardiac cath given hx of
dye allergy.
Patient presented to cath lab at 10:06 PM (therefore time of
onset of pain to cath lab was approximately 2.5 hours).  In cath
lab, patient found to have lesion in RCA extending into PDA and
PL - patient had 1 x stent placed in RCA-to-PDA, jailing the PL,
which was then rescued with balloon angioplasty (TIMI 3 flow
demonstrated).  Also noted to have 50% LAD lesion after D1, 70%
L Cx lesion, 40% proximal RCA lesion.  Hemodynamics were noted
to be CO 3.48, CI 2.02, PCWP 20, RA mean 15, PAP 46/22, RV 46/8.
 Cath course c/b some bradycardia, thought [**2-16**] vagal response,
responded to atropine.  Also had hypotension with SBP = 90's
intra-cath, given fluid boluses for total of 1.8L in cath (2.8L
total with 1L fluid bolus in ED).  Post cath pt noted to have
small groin hematoma.  Post cath EKG notable for resolution of
ST elevations, q waves in leads III and aVF.  Patient had
resolution of pain in cath lab.
Currently patient feels well.  Denies any chest pain/pressure,
SOB, diaphoresis, nausea, any other complaints.
ROS also negative for orthopnea, PND, LE edema.

.
CXR ([**4-8**]): Prominence of bilateral vasculature, which may
represent
early volume overload versus mild CHF.
.
C.cath ([**4-8**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD
had
50% stenosis after D1. The LCX had 70% OM2 stenosis. The RCA had

proximal 40% and 100% stenoses distally at the crux.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
pressures (mean RA pressure was 15mmHg, mean PCWP 20mmHg). There
was
evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension. The cardiac index
was
normal at 2.02 L/min/m2.
3. Successful PTCA/stenting of the distal RCA with a 3.0x18mm
Cypher DES
posted to 3.5mm in the proximal portion with excellent results
(see PTCA
comments).
.
TTE ([**4-10**]):
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  Patient is a 68 yo woman with PMH tobacco use,
presents with inferior/posterior STEMI with RV involvement.
.
# Cardiac:
A. Ischemia:  Patient presents with inferior/posterior STEMI
with RV involvement.  Course complicated by some hypotension
noted in cath lab, responsive to IVF boluses.  PCWP noted to be
20 intra-cath.  Initially monitored with Swan-Ganz catheter.
Received integrilin gtt x 18 hours.  Cardiac enzymes trended
down.
Continued on ASA 325mg QD, Plavix 75mg QD, Lipitor 80mg QD.
Started on a beta blocker and discharged on Toprol XL.  Started
on ACE-i and discharged on lisinopril.  Further lipid management
deferred to outpatient setting.  Discharged to follow up with
Cardiology, may need ETT-MIBI in the future.  Encouraged smoking
cessation.
.
B. Pump:  Patient with EF=65%, no wall motion abnormalities
noted on stress ECHO done at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2102-4-4**].  Intra
cath hemodynamics consistent with mild fluid overload, with
PCWP=20, RA=15, PAP=46/22.  TTE on [**4-10**] with EF 70-75%, no wall
montion abnormality, 1+ MR, and borderline PA systolic
hypertension.  Euvolemic on exam upon discharge.  Discharged on
beta blocker and ACE-inhibitor as above.
.
C. Rhythm:  Patient was in NSR.  Given RV involvement, was felt
to be high risk for arrythmia.  No signs of nodal block on EKG.
Had asymptomatic run of NSVT with stable vital signs.
Maintained and discharged on beta blocker.
.
# Hematoma:  Small hematoma noted in groin site post-cath.

discharge.  Hct stable.
.
# Rheumatoid Arthritis:  Patient on prednisone as outpatient.
Continued on prednisone with prn Tylenol for pain.
