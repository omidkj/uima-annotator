Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis x 2.  Midline placement for access.


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F presenting with increasing shortness of
breath, hypoxemia, and pleural effusion. The patient was
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 19627**] after she presented with a
noted L pleural effusion on CXR (done at her PCP's office),
cough, and DOE for 2 weeks prior. She was treated with
levofloxacin from [**Date range (1) 61971**] for presumed CAP. She had perhaps
mild improvement in symptoms initially, but her SOB and DOE have
worsened. She reports that she feels SOB at rest, and has been
unable to perform any activities. At baseline, up until 1.5
weeks ago, the pt was going to her pool for water aerobic
classes 3 times a week. She has a continued non-productive
cough, increased fatigue, and stable 2 pillow orthopnea. She
notes she is unable to speak without feeling SOB. She notes
increased weight of 145 lbs from her baseline of 130 lbs (unsure
over what time period this weight gain has been), and 8 months
of increasing abdominal girth. She has had no fevers, chills,
anorexia, palpitations, chest pain, syncope, nightsweats, or
abdominal pain. She presented to her PCP today with increased
shortness of breath and hypoxia, noted to be satting 87-88% RA.
She was referred to the ER for further management.
.
In the ED, the pts vitals were: T 97.2 HR 80 BP 132/62 RR 22 Sat
94% 3 L NC. CXR showed an increased L effusion. She received CTX
1 gm IV x1 and azithromycin 500 mg pox1.

EKG:

.
RETROPERITONEAL LIMITED US [**2150-4-27**]:
There is a large left pleural effusion. There is no ascites.
Surveillance views of the spleen and left kidney are
unremarkable. The liver is incompletely imaged.
IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion without ascites.
.
TTE [**2150-4-28**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). There is no
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient, but the
gradient increased with the Valsalva manuever into the mild
range. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is a mobile, linear density which is ill-defined
but seen in the proximal main pulmonary artery (2 cm x 0.cm)
which may represent mass or thrombus (best seen in clips 37, 39,
42) . The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 7 mmHg) due to extensive mitral annular calcification.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral
