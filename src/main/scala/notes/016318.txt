Chief Complaint:
Gait difficulty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation, warfarin non-compliance, CHF, 4 prior strokes now
presenting after being found by daughter on [**Name2 (NI) 24667**], unable to
stand.  The daughter went to her mother's home around 3:30 pm
today and found her sitting on the [**Name2 (NI) 24667**], soiled in urine and
feces and unable to stand-up.  She was also noted to be leaning
to the right side.  The daughter immediately knew something was
wrong and called her PCP who after 2 hours was able to convince
the patient to come to the ED.  The daughter says the mom's
speech was clear, she was moving both arms and legs but just
couldn't gather the energy to lift herself up.  At her baseline,
she is continent of urine/stool, walks about the house, cooks
meals, and cleans herself (although recently she has had more
difficulty with her ADLs).

The patient has had 3 strokes in the past beginning in [**2144**] when
she had right sided weakness and a left sided opercular stroke.
In [**2152**] she experienced more right sided weakness and aphasia
and
was told she had another "mini-stroke".  Her symptoms largely
resolved.  She was found to be in atrial fibrillation at that
time and was started on warfarin.  She had her 3rd stroke in
[**2156**]
when she presented with right facial paresthesias and mild
weakness.  An MRI done at that time revealed:  right frontal,
left opercular, right temporal, and right thalamic strokes.
Since that time, she has done reasonably well but has been
non-compliant at times with her warfarin.  In recent times she
has been in good range, last value was 2.4 on [**2165-2-14**] and all
values since [**Month (only) 404**] have been 2 or above.

[**2-27**] MRI/MRA of BRAIN
FINDINGS:
There is diffusion signal hyperintensity involving the right
inferior
cerebellar hemisphere, right cerebellar tonsil, and dorsolateral
medulla.
There is faintly increased T2 signal in this location, but the
FLAIR images do not really demonstrate edema.  This is
consistent with a very recent/acute infarction.  Otherwise,
there are numerous areas of increased T2 signal involving the
cerebral white matter and cortex, with volume loss, particularly
in the right frontal lobe.  These represent old areas of
infarction.
There is no ventricular dilatation or shift of structures at
this time.
No abnormal intracranial susceptibility artifact is identified.

MR angiography is somewhat limited by motion artifact.
Vertebral arteries are visible bilaterally, and there is flow
signal observed in the basilar artery and posterior cerebral
arteries as well as within the anterior and middle cerebral
arteries.  The posterior inferior cerebellar arteries are not
well seen, although the left posterior inferior cerebellar
artery is visible on the source images.
  IMPRESSION:
1.  MRI demonstrates an acute infarction in the inferior right
cerebellar
hemisphere, cerebellar tonsil, and adjacent dorsolateral
medulla.
2.  MRA is limited due to artifact, but there is flow signal in
both vertebral arteries and the basilar artery, as well as in
the anterior circulation. Detail is limited, but the right
posterior inferior cerebellar artery is not identified.

[**2165-2-27**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2158-10-9**] no
significant change.
* * *
[**2165-2-27**] CXR
IMPRESSION:  Marked cardiomegaly, without evidence of failure.
Diagnostic
considerations include chronic mitral valvular disease and
pericardial
effusion. Clinical correlation is requested.
* * *
[**2165-3-1**] ECHO
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated.  2. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall  left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
moderate sized, calcified mass on the aortic side of the
noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve.  Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.  4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  5. There
is a small pericardial effusion with fibrin deposits on the
surface  of the heart.  6. Compared with the findings of the
prior study of [**2164-11-5**], there has been  no significant change.



Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old female with atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, CHF, now with acute infarction of inferior
right cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellar tonsil, and adjacent
dorsolateral medulla.

 - Exam stable throughout admission.  Always alert and pleasant,
albeit occasionally confused.  Continued to complain of diplopia
in a skew pattern (second image up and to the side of the true
image), worst in primary gaze and when looking to the left (?
right fourth nerve palsy?).  Keeps head tilted to the left.
Nystagmus, especially with lateral gaze, persisted.  Right
facial weakness (as in previous admissions).  Very mild pronator
drift of left hand, which had nearly resolved at discharge.
Bilateral iliopsoas weakness, [**3-20**].  Remainder is strong.
However, patient unable to stand and walk unassisted.
  - Etiology of infarct is likely cardioembolic.  Her INR on
admission was subtherapeutic, and the plan is to
