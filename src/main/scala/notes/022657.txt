History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yo male with history of DM, hyperlipidemia,
and HTN who was diagnosed with AML after routine labs showed
pancytopenia. Bonemarrow biopsy at that time showed 50% blasts.
He was treated with one cycle of 7+3 and 2 cycles of decitabine,
with the last cycle [**2195-6-8**]. He is admitted for allogenic
stem cell transplant. Today, he is without complaints. He is
goal oriented and looking forward to beginning therapy. He
reports good appetitie. Denies F/C, N/V/D, Headache, Cough,
hematemesis, SOB, Chest Pain, Abdominal pain, dysuria.
.
Patient reports severe medication reaction on last admission and
states that it was due to "one of the four chemotherapy agents I
was given" descrivbing the reaction as erythemia that covered
his legs/arms/torso. According to the discharge summary from
[**Hospital1 18**] [**2195-5-2**] Allergy was consulted who believed that the rash
was from either Cefepime or Aztreonam and recommended avoiding
all cephalosporins avoid all cephalosporins (in particular
Cefepime and Ceftazidime) and Aztreonam.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo male recently diagnosed with AML s/p 7+3 induction and 2
cycles of Decitabine, last cycle on [**2195-6-8**].  He was admitted
for double cord transplant with Day 0 on [**8-10**].

#AML: He had neutropenic fever, which is why he is on Meropenem,
Vancomycin. The patient has had rashes to aztreonam and
cefepime.  He takes Atovaquone, Acyclovir, and Voriconazole for
prophylaxis.  He was afebrile for 10 days, and was thus taken
off the Meropenem and Vancomycin prior to discharge, during
which he remained afebrile.  His counts improved, and his ANC
remained above 1500 off Neupogen, indicating that he was
successfully engrafted.  He will be discharged to the apartments
and will come in daily to the heme/onc clinic.
.
His course has been complicated by a visit for the ICU from
which he returned approximately 1 week ago; he had been in the
ICU after having an increased oxygen requirement on the floor,
[**Last Name (un) **], and noted decrease in his ejection fraction on Echo. His
echo revealed cardiomyopathy, with a depressed EF of 30%, but
the source of his cardiomyopathy is unclear at this time. He was
intubated, but following diuresis and initiation on imdur,
beta-blockade, and hydralazine improved. He returned to the
floor on room air.

BRIEF [**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:

Respiratory Distress / Heart Failure - Patient was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress in the setting of mild bump
in cardiac enzymes (Troponin peak 0.11), new effusions on CXR,
and non-specific Twave changes on EKG.  Echo demonstrated
decreased poor systolic function (EF 35%).  The patient required
imediate intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure.  The
diagnostics and imaging point to pulmonary edema [**1-13**] to CHF in
the setting of ACS, although given the patient's neutropenic
status infection was also considered.  The patient was gently
diuresed and weaned from the ventilator.  PNA was covered by the
patient's existing broad neutropenic prophylaxis (vanco, [**Last Name (un) 2830**],
micafungin).  He was extubated and was weaned from supplemental
O2.  At the time of his transfer out of the ICU, he was stable
on room air.

HTN - On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's antihypertensives
had been held given his low blood pressure.  Following the
patient's extubation, the patient became hypertensive to SBP
160s-180s.  He was started on hydralazine, carvedilol and imdur
to reduce afterload.  He also had a vasovagal bradycardic
episode and triggered for HRs in the 40s.  He was monitored on
tele with no further events.  He was seen by cardiology, who
recommended patient be restarted on metoprolol and diovan for
treatment of hypertension and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  He
will follow-up with cardiology after discharge.
.
[**Last Name (un) **] - On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient's Creatinine was
elevated to high 2s, from baseline of 0.9.  This was thought to
be multifactorial, [**1-13**] to to nephrotoxic chemotherapeutics and
due to poor renal perfusion in the setting of heart failure /
ACS.  His cyclosporin was held pending improvement in the
patient's renal function.  He did not have any metabolic
derangements and his renal function gradually improved to 1.3
by the time of his transfer back to the BMT service.  On
discharge, his Cr was 1.4.
