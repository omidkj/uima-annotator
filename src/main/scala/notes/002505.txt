Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Right carotid stenosis.

carotid arteriogram and stenting of right carotid
endarterectomy repair with a 9 x 30 carotid Wallstent.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 63-year-old gentleman with right
carotid stenosis who underwent a right carotid endarterectomy
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He had a lesion in the distal ICA noted on
completion angiography, performed due to poor distal signal.
This appeared to be possibly a clamp injury. This was in an
area of the ICA that was not surgically accessible and
therefore, intraoperative consultation was requested for
possible carotid stenting.

PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison made to [**2168-11-13**]. Scattered
ill-defined
bilateral airspace opacities again show slight improvement.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

CT SCAN:

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism till the level of [**Last Name (un) **] and
part of the segmental arteries .

2. Extensive pulmonary abnormalities, differential diagnosis
includes
infection, hemorrhage desquamative interstitial pneumonia;
radiographically, pulmonary edema is another possibility, even
though this does not correlate with the clinical picture.

3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is likely reactive in the
setting of
extensive pulmonary abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21973**],[**Known firstname **]  was admitted on [**11-8**] with Carotid Artery
Stenosis. He agreed to have an elective surgery.
Pre-operatively, he was consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC,
Electrolytes, T/S - were obtained,  all other preparations were
made.

It was decided that she would undergo a:

Right carotid endarterectomy and bovine pericardial patch.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

But during the procedure the patient had a higher lesion that
was not amendable to endarectomy. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] was called
into the  case:

Angioplasty along with right cervical carotid arteriogram and
stenting of right carotid endarterectomy repair with a 9 x 30
carotid Wallstent.

Post-operatively, he was extubated and transferred to the PACU
for further stabilization and monitoring.

Plavix was started for the stent.

He was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While
in the VICU he received monitored care.

Pt did have episodes of SOB. Pt was heavy smoker. He did require
oxygen. Pt developed PNA. Treated appropriately. DC on PO
antibiotics. This event did require a cardiology consult.
Originally thought to be  CHF. Echo showed preserved EF, but
some right sided heart failure.. BNP was close to normal. He was
originally diuresed.

Was thought to be a PE, received a CT scan:

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism till the level of lobar and
part of the
segmental arteries .

2. Extensive pulmonary abnormalities, differential diagnosis
includes
infection, hemorrhage desquamative interstitial pneumonia;
radiographically,
pulmonary edema is another possibility, even though this does
not correlate
with the clinical picture.

3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is likely reactive in the
setting of
extensive pulmonary abnormality.

To note pt does have CRI. His creatinine did bump with the
Lasix. On DC his creatine is at baseline. His nephrotoxic drugs
were held, on DC they have been restarted.

Pt also had a pulmonary consult: Levaquin alone to cover for
community-acquired aspiration if Cxs negative. Pt to be
discharged on Levaquin.

When stable he was delined. His diet was advanced. A PT consult
was obtained. When he was stabilized from the acute setting of
post operative care, she was transferred to floor status

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve her
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. He was discharged home in stable
condition.

To note he does not require home )@. He was weaned off of 02 on
DC.
