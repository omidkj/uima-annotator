Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
48F h/o paroxysmal SVT, ?valvular dysfunction, tobacco abuse,
?COPD presented to OSH on [**2147-5-16**] with acute SOB and hemoptysis.
She had evidently been feeling unwell for 4-5 days with URI type
symptoms. On the evening of admission she developed acute SOB
with initially clear sputum that became bloody so she presented
to the hospital. She was treated for CHF with lasix and for
?bronchitis/PNA with moxifloxacin given in the setting of a WBC
of 22. Blood cultures were sent. She was also in atrial
fibrillation with RVR, with HR 160s treated with diltiazem drip.
She ruled-out for MI with flat serial enzymes (Trop 0.07). She
had respiratory decompensation on the floor (ABG 7.39/31/47) and
required intubation. She was taken to cath to evaluate valves as
concern for acute MR resulting in CHF which showed angiographic
clean coronaries, elevated right heart pressures (RA 16, RV
48/12/18, PA 42/24/34), PCWP and LVEDP 28, elevated aortic
gradient mid-LV of 70mmHg, LV gram 65% with thick asymmetric
septal hypertrophy consistent with HOCM as well as discrete
apical aneurysm, [**3-14**]+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was reportedly without vegetation.
Transferred initially to CT surgery for ?MVR but then
transitioned to CCU for further care as surgery felt that no
immediate intervention was needed.
.
ROS: Unable to assess on arrival because patient was intubated
and sedated.

STUDIES
[**Month/Day (1) **] [**2147-5-19**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is asymmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Midsystolic closure of the
aortic leaflets is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. The mitral valve leaflets are
elongated. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is marked
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

A left ventricular outflow tract gradient, probably severe, is
present, but could not be quantitated with certainty due to the
presence of mitral regurgitation signal in the continuous wave
outflow tract spectral Doppler waveform.

IMPRESSION: asymmetric septal hypertrophy; hyperdynamic left
ventricle; mitral valve systolic anterior motion;
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation; left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48 y/o F with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,
severe MR, COPD PSVT who presented with acute decompensation
requiring intubation in the setting of pneumonia.
.
# Pump: Newly diagnosed HOCM with acute decompensation likely
secondary to infection which led to atrial fibrillation with
RVR, decreased filling and increased gradient across the LV
outflow tract. Her [**Month/Day/Year 113**] was markedly abnormal (see above for
report), but once she was stabilized, infection was treated, she
was diuresed with IV lasix, and rate was controlled, her cardiac
function was adequate, and ultimately she was discharged on
Toprol XL 300mg daily.
.
# Rhythm: Rate was controlled w/ Toprol XL and rhythm control w/
amiodarone x2 months. She was transitioning to coumadin w/
Lovenox. Her overall plan for treatment of atrial fibrillation
was:
- Amiodarone(2 months)
- Lovenox as bridge to coumadin
- Coumadin 5mg daily
- Toprol XL as above
- Check INR at cardiologist Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 78498**] office the
week of discharge
.
# Valves: HOCM with severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 113**]. Obstruction reduced by
rate control. Surgery declined immediate intervention but
outpatient follow-up was scheduled with the attending cardiac
surgeon for consideration of future intervention.
.
# Respiratory failure: She was extubated [**2147-5-21**]; inhalers and
nebulizers were administered prn after that. She required some
supplemental oxygen for much of the stay, but ultimately had
good O2 saturation with ambulation. She was treated for atypical
pneumonia with levofloxacin, for a 14 day course to be completed
with PO levofloxacin as an outpatient, as shown below.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: Cardiac cath negative for CAD
