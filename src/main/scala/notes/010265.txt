Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known firstname 26693**] [**Known lastname **] is an 87yo retired male cardiothoracic
surgeon with h/o CAD with inoperable multivessel dz, 2 prior
anterolateral and inferior MI s/p BMS to pLAD in [**11/2195**], DES to
D1 in [**2-/2200**] c/b GIB in setting of anticoag, ICM with EF
30-40%, HTN, hyperlipidemia, colon and prostate CA, presenting
with increased anginal pain. The reports intermittent pain
throughout day of admission with relief of his symptoms with
nitro. He then developed crushing SSCP after taking a long walk
which did not respond to NTG. His pain is associated with
nausea, but denies dyspnea, cough, or diaphoresis. He denies
orthopnea and PND, but has had increased LE edema.
.
In the ED, Initial vitals 99.6, 90, 132/62, 16, 98% 2L. By the
time he arrived in the ED he was chest pain free. EKG showed
ST-E in III and aVF and ST-D in the lateral leads. His initial
TnT was 0.12. He was given ASA 325mg, Plavix 300mg, and started
on a heparin drip. His CXR showed possible opacity in left so he
was given IV levaquin 750mg x 1. He was guaiac. He was
transfered to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further management.
.
On the floor he was evaluated and taken to cath which showed
known proximal LCx and RCA occlusions, patent pLAD and D1 stents
with known occlusion of the LAD after D1, and filling via L-L
collaterals to the distal LAD and LCx. He developed CHF and new
Afib with RVR to the 120a post cath and was transfered to the
CCU for further management. His O2 requirement increased post
procedure and required diuresis with furosemide 20mg IV x 3 to
which he diuresed 3 litres. He continues to require 2 litres
supplemental oxygen. Regarding his new Afib with RVR, he
received 10mg IV metoprolol followed by 12.5mg PO metoprolol. He
was anticoagulated with heparin and started on warfarin and
underwent unsuccessful cardioversion. He was then loaded with
amiodarone and converted into sinus. Of note, the Pt reports
that he has had prior episodes of atrial fibrillation in [**2185**],
[**2190**], and [**2195**] which were asymptomatic except for a pulse in the
120s. At those times it resolved spontaneously. His Afib was
asymptomatic this admission as well, but given his CAD he was
unlikely to tolerate it for very long.
.
On transfer to the floor he is in sinus and stable on 2L O2. He
is CP free, able to lie flat, and feeling the best he has since
admission.

Reports
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
severe three vessel disease that was not significantly changed
from his
last cardiac catheterization.  The LMCA had a 50% distal
stenosis.  The
LAD was occluded in the mid-vessel but had widely patent stents
proximally and in the D1 branch.  The LCx was occluded
proximally and
the OMs filled via left-left collaterals.  The RCA was not
engaged as it
was known to be occluded.
2. Central aortic pressure was 134/69/97mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Widely patent stents in the proximal LAD and D1 branch.

LE doppler
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.

[**3-5**] Echo
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
walls, and distal inferolateral walls. The apex is dyskinetic
and aneurysmal. The remaining walls contract well (LVEF 30-35%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Complex (>4mm, non-mobile) plaque is seen in the abdominal aorta
(clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2200-4-25**], the findings are similar.
