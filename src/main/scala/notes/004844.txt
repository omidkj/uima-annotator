Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M with history of asthma and EtOH abuse presented with
asthma flare.  On presentation he had a respiratory acidosis
likely [**2-10**] CO2 retention from EtOH intoxication and acute asthma
flare, with possible component of COPD as well given patient's
50 pack-year smoking hx.   In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he recieved one day of
solumedrol and then was transitioned to PO prednisone 60 with 2
week outpatient taper.  He was also given neb treatments q4h.
His peak flows were followed and remained in the low 200s (his
baseline was unknown; predicted was 580 cc).  Prophyllactically,
he received pneumovax [**2173-10-11**].  He was ordered a steroid
inhaler and prn albuterol inhaler for his discharge but eloped
from the hospital without them.
.
He had a history of EtOH abuse for over 40 yrs, having been to
rehab several times in past and cared for previously at [**Hospital1 2177**].
His LFTs were normal.  He was in acute withdrawal when he
presented to the floor and received valium 10 mg Q4 prn CIWA
scale score >10.  He recieved MVI, thiamine, B12, folate daily.
A SW consult wwas placed to arrange outpatient alcohol
rehabilitation, possible at the McInness house.  To facilitate
placement, a PPD was placed on [**2173-10-13**] and was negative (0 mm
induration).
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was hypertensive and had an EKG with
possibile inferolateral ischemia.  His progressive DOE may be
manifestation of coronary disease or CHF rather than lung
disease.  Cardiac Enzymes were negative.  He was started on ASA
325 po qd.  His BB was held in house given acute asthma flare,
but he was written for a BB as an outpatient.  On the floor his
blood pressure was controlled with captopril Q8.

His free water deficit was calculated to be 2.5 L from EtOH
consumption.  This was repleted and he received a banana bag on
[**10-11**].  He tolerated [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]/Cardiac diet while in house.  He was
placed on a PPI.

SW and Case managers worked dilligently on his discharge plan
for McInness house (medical stabilization for homeless),
[**Hospital1 **] stabilization center (for EtOH sobriety), or [**Location (un) **]
Shelter (homeless shelter with health facility).  They arranged
for him to get [**Location (un) 1131**] glasses and prescription medications for
the weekend.  On morning of discharge the patient left AWOL.  No
review of discharge plans or discharge medications or
disposition or follow-up arrangements could be made as a result.


Should the patient return for care at [**Hospital1 18**], he would benefit
from PFTs, Stress test, and development of a relationship with a
PCP.
