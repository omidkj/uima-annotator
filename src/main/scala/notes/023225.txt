Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
65 F w/ h/o Ileocolectomy/Ileostomy/Mucous fistula on [**6-28**] found
unresponsive at nursing home. Pt had recently been takien to the
OR for delayed resection after small bowel obstruction (delayed
[**2-17**] patient refusal) with resection of proximal right colon,
distal [**1-18**] of small bowel. At that time the cecum and distal [**1-18**]
of the small bowel were seen to be infarcted and necrotic, but
no perforation was identified. The patient was intubated on
scene by EMS and taken to [**Hospital 15405**] where a head CT was obtained.
Initial labs were significant for: WBC=34.7, K=7.0 Lactate 19.3,
AST 932, ALT 263. Patient recieved total of 6mg of versed 1mg of
ativan for potential seizure activity and 50mcg of fentanyl.

Prior to discharge from her previous hospitalization, the
patient had been alert and oriented, had refused PEG placement
and remained full code. By report, the patient was found
unresponsive at her nursing facility and was intubated and taken
to [**Hospital 15405**] where she was observed to be in multisystem organ
failure and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.

At [**Hospital1 **] initial vitals were BP 50/30 on levophed in ED. Was
pulseless for less than a minute while bag was being changed and
no CPR was done. Ileostomy had gross blood, colostomy had guaiac
pos stool. Foley had purulent fluid. She did withdraw to pain in
the ED. Ab CT without acute process. ECG: NSR, LAD, qtc 444, ST
dep II, IV V4-V6. [**Doctor First Name **] consulted and said not surgical candiate.
Pt vommited around OG tube, tube was clogged and replaced.

On the floor, patient intubated and withdraws to pain only.

IMAGING:

Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Aortic valve sclerosis

LENI's:
Portable duplex son[**Name (NI) 867**] of the lower extremities was
performed. The deep vein demonstrates patent flow with normal
compressibility and normal response to augmentation. There is no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity

CT A/P:
1. Limited evaluation due to lack of IV and oral contrast.
However, no
evidence of obstruction, abscess or other acute intra-abdominal
process in
this patient status post ileocolectomy.

2. Extensive calcification of the abdominal and pelvic arterial
vasculature.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old female with a history of DM, CAD, CHF, recent
mesenteric ischemia s/p partical large and small bowel resection
who was found down at nursing home for an indeterminate amount
of time, intubated on the scene and eventually transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
for multi-organ failure.  Patient was in multiorgan failure
which resolved with broad spectrum antibiotics and aggressive
fluid resuscitation.  She was ultimately extubated successfully.
 She was discharge to hospice at her nursing home.

# Septic Shock:  Treated with broad spectrum abx and aggressive
fluid resusciation (~12 L).  The source was unclear though her
urinanalysis was positive so treated for urine source.  Also
suspected possible abdominal source given recent surgery and had
multiple pressure ulcers upon arrival which could be a potential
source.  Treated initially with vanc/zosyn, changed to
vanc/cefepime/cipro/flagyl and then narrowed to
cefepime/cipro/flagyl.

# Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated in the setting of
unresponsiveness.  She was quickly weaned to pressure support
and extubated without difficulty.  There was no evidence of COPD
or pneumonia on her imaging.

# Coagulopathy:  Patient was in low grade DIC which improved
with treatment as above. There was likely a nutritional
component of this as well as her albumin was 2.3 on admission
and she was reversed with vitamin K 10mg iv - po not given as
concern for poor absorption.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine initially elevated
to 5 likely from hypovolemia which resolved with IVF as above.
Returned to baseline of....

# Electrolyte Abnormalities:  Was hyperkalemic and hypernatremic
which was likely related to renal failure. Abnormalities
resolved.

# Elevated LFTs: Likely shock liver, trended down.

# NSTEMI:  Likely related to poor perfusion in setting of shock.
 Was not a candidate for cath as was probably microvascular
hypoperfusion.

# Code:  Discussed with son - DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**]
