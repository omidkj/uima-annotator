History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year-old woman with GERD, ischemic colitis,
diabetes, ESRD on HD MWF and dCHF (echo [**2201**] LVEF 50-55%), who
presents with dyspnea on her scheduled HD day. Patient reports
symptomatic dyspnea and diaphoresis this morning prompting
presentation to the ED.

Imaging:

pulmonary edema.  Tip of dialysis catheter resides in the
expected location of the right atrium.
[**2202-11-16**] CXR: 1.  Improving pulmonary edema.  Mild edema
persists. 2.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year-old woman with GERD, ischemic colitis,
diabetes, ESRD on HD MWF and dCHF (echo [**2201**] LVEF 50-55%), who
presented with dyspnea consistent with worsened pulmonary edema.


# Dyspnea: Patient has known dCHF and volume managed by
hemodialysis. Patient presented today with dyspnea in the
setting of hypertension and volume overload with likely rapid
accumulation of pulmonary edema. CXR showed pulmonary edema.
Renal was consulted in the ED and advised MICU admsision for
urgent HD. Patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation in the
ED for better patient comfort, however was only requiring 2L
nasal cannula in the MICU prior to dialysis. She underwent HD
with 1L fluid removal. She symptomatically felt better, was
weaned to room air with good saturations, and a repeat CXR
showed improvement in pulmonary edema (characterizing it only as
mild). Cardiac enzymes were trended and MB was flat, so there
was no concern for ACS.  ECG was not appreciably changed from
previous. Hypertension was managed as below.

# HTN: Patient has known hypertension, managed with oral
medication as an outpatient and volume managed with HD/UF.
Patient was initially managed on a nitroglycerin ggt, but was
quickly weaned to her home medications of lisinopril 40mg daily
and carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 **], with the addition of Nifedipine CR 30
mg PO daily for improved blood pressure control. Volume status
was imprvoed as above.

# Asymptomatic UTI: Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was treated with three days of
ciprofloxacin for a positive urine analysis. Her urine culture
returned with <100K of lactobacillus species, which is likely a
contaminent.

# Chronic diastolic heart failure: This was thought to have been
contributing to the patient's current presentation. Managed as
above. Home regimen of lisinopril, atorvastatin, and carvedilol
were continued and nifedipine was added for better BP control.

# ESRD: Renal was consulted in the ED and recommended urgent
hemodialysis for volume overload. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the
MICU and underwent 1L fluid removal with clinical improvement.
Continued phosphate binder and nephrocaps. She will continue on
her regular HD schedule after discharge.

# Seizure disoder: Stable. Continued her levetiracetam home
regimen.

# CAD: Stable. Continued home aspirin and plavix. Enzymes were
cycled and MB remained flat.

# DMII:  Continued regimen of NPH QAM and insulin sliding scale.


# HLD: Continued atorvastatin.

- Mrs. [**Known lastname **] will receive her no
