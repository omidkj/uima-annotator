Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for left thalamic hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 915**] is an 86 year-old right-handed woman with a past
medical history including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD on
3L O2, s/p pacemaker placement and TIAs who initially presented
to [**Hospital6 204**] with language difficulties and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] when she was found to have a left
thalamic hemorrhage in the context of hypertension (bp 154/87).
.
The patient's daughter [**Name (NI) **] explained that the patient seemed
well until about 8:30 pm on [**2159-7-14**].  At that time, she noticed
Ms. [**Known lastname 915**] was not contributing to the conversation as she
normally would.  The patient ultimately spoke in full English
grammatically correct sentences that seemed to have little
relevance to the ongoing conversation.  Her daughter recalls she
couldn't seem to follow her mother's train of thought.  She did
not ask her mother to try to read or write.  Concerned she might
be experiencing a vascular event, she tried to convince her
mother to take aspirin 325 mg (which she ultimately did).  When
the symptoms did not resolve, she called the patient's PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
the recommendation of the PCP, 911 was called and the patient
was
transported to [**Hospital6 204**].  There initial vital
signs included a blood pressure of 154/87, hr 83, rr 16, O2 sat
94% on 2L.  An initial examination was not available for review.

A non-contrast CT of the head was performed and demonstrated a
left thalamic hemorrhage.  Accordingly, the patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and care.  At
the
time of the interview, the patient agrees she seems to be having
some difficulty using the right words to communicate her

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 915**] is a RHF with a past medical history of HTN,
Hyperlipidemia, COPD using 3L O2, TIA's and s/p pacemaker. Who
presented to [**Hospital6 **] for language difficulties.
Initial workup there revealed HTN, language difficulties and a
left thalamic hemorrhage. The patient was then transferred here
[**Hospital1 18**] for further workup. Upon evaluation here the patient was
noted to have language difficiulties. Notable for disorientation
to time, date, anommia, paraphasic errors and poor short term
memory. Initially there was decreased temperture and pinprick
sensation on the right side both upper and lower extremities
that had noramalized by the time of the  discharge. The patient
was initially taken to the ICU for closer observation. There was
no acute events during ICU evaluation and observation.  A repeat
CT head did not show expansion of the hemorrhage. The patients
blood pressure was then stabalized with amlodipine 5mg daily.
The patient was then transferred to the floor for further
evaluationand observation. the patient did not have any acute
events on the general neurology unit. She was evaluated by
physical therapy and the decision was made that she would
benefit from rehabilitation. She was discharged in stable good
condition to the rehab unit with specific speech rehabilitaion
for thalamic type aphasia.

Medications on Admission:

frequency. And more specifically does not take lasix as
prescribed.

Discharge Medications:
