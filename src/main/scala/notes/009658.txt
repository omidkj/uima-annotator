[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old woman with COPD exacerbation. Currently tachypnic
and mildly hypoxic.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? COPD exacerbation vs. another acute process
INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with COPD exacerbation. Currently,
tachypneic and mildly hypoxic. Evaluate for acute process.
COMPARISON: [**2124-2-7**].
SINGLE VIEW, CHEST: There has been interval improvement in
parenchymal aeration. There may be a small left pleural
effusion, unchanged. There is evidence of bilateral pleural
thickening. Hilar contour, cardiomediastinal contour, pulmonary
vasculature appear within normal limits. Unchanged subtle right
lower lobe atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette is upper limit of
normal, unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in bilateral parenchymal
aeration. No other acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23705**] is a 66yo female with PMH as listed above who presents
with increasing respiratory distress.
.
# Respiratory distress/Hypoxia: Patient presented with
increasing respiratory distress and oxygen requirement. Upon
transfer to the MICU her O2 requirement rapidly decreased
although she remained extremely wheezy on exam. No mental status
changes. No report of fevers, chills, chest pain, or LE edema.
Clinically, most consistent with COPD exacerbation.  Infection
is unlikely given lack of white count, fevers, productive cough,
and CXR without infiltrate. CHF exacerbation is unlikely given
EF>60% on most recent [**Known lastname **]. Given her immobility and concern for
PE, LE dopplers were performed which were negative. Patient was
started back on prednisone 60mg.  Had recently completed rapid
taper of steroids after prior COPD exacerbation.  Concern that
steroids were potentially exacerbating her psychosis.  However,
given her current exacerbation, using longer taper this time.
She was continued on  albuterol and atrovent nebulizer
treatments with transition to home regimen including advair,
tiotropium and albuterol inhalers prior to discharge.
.
# COPD: Patient presented with symptoms suggestive of a COPD
exacerbation. She has been transferred to the medical service
several times over the past few weeks for closer management. She
has required antibiotics and nearly completed a 3 day prednisone
taper prior to her exacerbation. Patient is home oxygen
dependent using 4L NC at baseline. Per old [**Known lastname **] notes, appears
baseline sats on RA are 88-92%.  Prednisone and nebulizers as
above with transition to home regimen prior to discharge.
.
# Abdominal pain: Unclear etiology. Patient states she has had
this for many years. Also difficult to illicit true exam due to
patient's psychiatric status.  LFTs on [**1-26**] wnl. CXR suggested
stool impaction.  Bowel regimen was increased and patient was
having regular bowel movements prior to discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Patient is on beta-blocker and thiazide as
outpatient. Concerned over beta blockade in the setting of
severe COPD. Her beta blocker was held and initially she was
continued on her thiazide with good control.  However, she
subsequently developed hyponatremia and her thiazide was stopped
as well.  Should the need arise, would add low dose Norvasc for
blood pressure control if she is hypertensive off her home
medications.
.
# Hyponatremia: Appears patient has had this in the past.  [**Month (only) 116**]
have been component of hypovolemia secondary to low PO and
thiazide diuretic, combined with component of adrenal
insufficiency in the settting of rapid steroid taper.  Also
SIADH in the setting of severe pulmonary disease.  Patient was
placed on a fluid restriction of 1.5L daily. Thiazide diuretic
was discontinued.  Sodium returned to baseline prior to
discharge.
.
# Schizophrenia: Patient was transferred from psych unit on [**Hospital1 **]
4. She is on an extensive medication regimen. She is section 12.
 She was continued on her outpatient regimen with several
changes as listed and was pleasant and redirectable during
admission.
.
# Leukocytosis: Developed after prednisone initiated. No
evidence of UTI or other infectious process. Likely secondary to
steroids. Should continue to monitor.
