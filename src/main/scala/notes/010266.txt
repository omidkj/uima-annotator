MRI [**2129-8-10**]: there is a 4.9-cm bilobed mass in the left
frontal lobe anteriorly.  The mass appears to be centrally
necrotic.  It has
irregular enhancing rim.  There is surrounding FLAIR
hyperintense
edema and
there is depression of the body and frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left
lateral ventricle
without significant rightward shift of midline structures.
There
is some
effacement of the left frontal sulci.

There are other areas of patchy FLAIR hyperintensity in the
cerebral white
matter, but no underlying enhancing lesion is seen elsewhere.
There is
prominence of the ventricles and sulci.

Posterior to the dens, there is low signal intensity material
extending
superiorly, along the posterior margin of the clivus, indenting
the
cervicomedullary junction without edema in the medulla or spinal
cord.  The
appearance of this low signal intensity material and the thick
adjacent dural
enhancement suggests a heavily calcified meningioma.  The lesion
is of
increased density on the CT that was obtained as a part of the
PET scan on
[**2130-3-15**].  It does not appear to have significantly changed in
size.

IMPRESSION:
1.  There is an approximately 5-cm left frontal mass with some
mass effect on
the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].  It could be related to the patient's
lymphoma or could
be another malignancy such as a glioblastoma.
2.  There is an anterior extra-axial mass associated with the
dens and clivus
with thick adjacent dural enhancement almost certainly a
meningioma.  There is
a mild compression of the cervicomedullary junction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] oncology service from transfer from
outside hospital. He was evaluated for his altered mental status
and brain lesion.  On [**8-11**] he went to the OR where under local
anesthesia he underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy which
preliminarily shows a glioma.  He was transferred to the PACU
and then had CT of brain which showed a good post op appearance.
 He was transferred to the floor. Activity and diet were
advanced. He was seen by PT and OT and felt to need a rehab
stay. His incision remained clean and dry.
