Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
74 yo female, transferred from [**Hospital1 1872**] rehab for recurrent
flash pulmonary edema.  Pt recently admitted/hospital stay at
[**Hospital1 **] on [**9-8**] for DKA and NSTEMI.  At this time, pt had a
long/complicated hospital course, determined not to be a
candidate for cardiac catheterization and MI managed medically.
She developed pulm edema, respiratory failure, was intubated,
developed vent-associated pna (MSSA), treated with levo until
[**10-7**].  She failed extubation and was eventually PEG/Trached,
sent to rehab on [**10-2**].  At rehab, pt had multiple episodes of
flash pulm edema that were managed with Morphine and lasix prn.
This morning, she had a similar episode with desat to 85%,
tachypnea to 30's, and SBP=78 with leukocytosis.  At family's
request and with these symptoms, she was transferred back here.
On presentation, she received MSO4 for dyspnea, was febrile to
102.2, BP=90/41, WBC=19 with left shift.  Pt with some new EKG
changes (t-wave inv v5-6, st elev v2-4), and elevated tnt.  Pt
admitted to MICU at this time for management of respiratory
failure vs. pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74F s/p recent NSTEMI, VAP, with recurrent flash pulmonary
edema, presenting with respiratory distress, fever,
leukocytosis, in setting of likely more flash pulmonary edema.

1.  Fever/leukocytosis - The patient was pan cultured and grew
out MSSA from her sputum for which she was treated with
clindimycin.

2.  Respiratory Failure - likely multifactorial with
contributions from both PNA and CHF.  The MSSA PNA was treated
with clindimycin for a 2 week course.  The CHF team was
consulted regarding the patients CHF.  A cardiac cath was
performed which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease, moderate systolic ventricular dysfuction, and moderate
diastolic ventricular function. It was decided at this time that
the patients CAD was not amenable to PCI and that medical
management was the best option.  Hence the patient was optimized
on a medical regimen which included hydralazine, clonidine,
captopril, metoprolol, amlodipine, isordil, plavix, and aspirin.
 On this regimen, the patients BP's were maintained with
systolics in the 140's.

3. DM - The patient's blood sugars were controlled on an insulin
drip.  At discharge the drip was converted to an equivalent dose
NPH/Regular.

4. Hypothyroidism - the patient was continued on her home dose
of synthroid.

5. Code Status - DNR.  Given the patient's severe CAD/CHF the
patient's functional status is severely impaired and she is now
vent dependent.  Her prognosis for any meningful recovery is
grim and this was discussed in detail with the family which ha
decided to make her DNR.
