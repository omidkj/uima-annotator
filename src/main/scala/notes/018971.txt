Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated, arterial line


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10687**] was a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with no known PMH who had not
seen a physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 35 years and presented with SOB x 1 month.
She was having a monthly inspection at home when she told the
inspector she had general body pain for 1 month with shortness
of breath and productive cough in addition to sore throat. She
was BIBA after c/o productive cough and general malaise. Denies
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.  Does endorse CP with
precordial palpation.

On arrival to the ED, the patient appeared comfortable and had
O2 sats in the mid-90's.  She was placed on a NRB and vitals
were 98.4 92 131/46 24 100% 10L nrb.  A CXR showed a mass in the
apical portion of the left lung, concern for CA.  Around 2pm,
the patient began to have worsening respiratory distress with
sats into the 80s.  She was tachypneic and had a systolic BP
>200.  Concern was for flash pulmonary edema and she was started
on a nitro drip and BIPAP with improvemnet.  At 4:45, she was
sent for a CTA which revealed complete collapse of the LUL with
a central hypodensity concerning for mass vs. necrosis.  On
return for the CTA, the patient had respiratory decompensation
requiring intubation.  Following intubation, the patient's BPs
fell and a CVL was placed for norepinephrine. Transferred to the
MICU.

On transfer, VS were 155/77, 88, 22, 99% vent.

Cytology Report BRONCHIAL BRUSHINGS Procedure Date of [**2138-7-4**]

Bronchial brushings, endobronchial lung mass:

  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,

  Consistent with carcinoid tumor.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2138-7-3**]
3:35 PM

IMPRESSION:

1. No acute pulmonary embolus.

2. Marked heterogeneity with focal areas of hypodensity in a
collapsed left
upper lung likely due to a neoplasm with areas of necrosis.
Extensive
mediastinal and hilar adenopathy causing attenuation of the
right and left
main pulmonary arteries and left upper lobe and lingular
arterial branches.  Soft tissue density within the left upper
lobe bronchus may represent mucus plugging or tumor infiltrate.

3. Large pericardial effusion without definite radiographic
evidence of
tamponade physiology. Echocardiography should be considered as
clinically
indicated.

4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple fluid
attenuation and
bibasilar consolidative opacities could represent atelectasis or
infection.

5. Patchy opacities in the right lung could represent aspiration
or
infection.

6. Probable vascular congestion and mild edema.

7. Thickening of the left adrenal gland without discrete nodule.


8. Incompletely evaluated hyperdense lesion arising from the
left kidney,
possibly a hyperdense cyst.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2138-7-11**] 10:38 AM

IMPRESSION:

Near resolved edema. Unchanged left lower lobe atelectasis and
large left
upper lobe mass. Right upper lobe resolving pneumonia.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2138-7-4**] at 10:23:49 AM

Impression: moderate pericardial effusion; no chamber collapse
but this may be absent despite the presence of high
intrapericardial pressures when severe pulmonary hypertension is
also present; apical hypokinesis of the left ventricle, with
apical ballooning of the right ventricle (consider Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy with right ventricular as well as left
ventricular manifestation)

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2138-7-3**]  10:32:14 AM


Sinus rhythm. Possikble inferior wall myocardial infarction, age
indeterminate.
Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes. No previous tracing
available for

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10687**] was a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with no known previous medical
history who presented with progressive shortness of breath,
cough, and general malaise for a month, intubated for
respiratory distress, found to have LUL lung mass (carcinoid vs
small cell) and likely post-obstructive pneumonia on imaging.
Ms. [**Known lastname 10687**] was extubated on [**7-11**] after family discussion and
decision for no further aggressive treatment and passed away on
[**2138-7-13**] on comfort measures.

# Lung Mass
Patient was found to have LUL mass.  She underwent bronchoscopy
on [**7-4**] at which time she was noted to have significant external
compression of LUL bronchus, after which bronchus opened up
again to friable tissue.  Cytologic brushings returned positive
for neuroendocrine tumor cells, most consistent with carcinoid
tumor, though could not definitively rule out small cell,
particularly based on bronchoscopy visualization.  She was also
noted to have pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade,
presumed to be malignant pericardial effusion.  Because of
patient's poor prognosis, decision was made by family and
medical team not to pursue treatment.  Patient was extubated
[**2138-7-11**]; decision for comfort measures only was made on [**2138-7-12**],
and she passed away [**2138-7-13**].

# Respiratory Failure
Multifactorial, secondary to LUL mass and post-obstructive
pneumonia.  Patient was treated with a 9 day course of
vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia in the setting of potential
sepsis.  Antibiotics were discontinued when patient was placed
on comfort measures.  Her blood pressures were intermittently
low and requiring norepinephrine for support intermittently,
though hypotension presumably partially secondary to sedation.
TTE showed EF of 40-45% with apical hypokinesis, and she was
noted to have some pulmonary edema and pleural effusions and was
diuresed as tolerated by blood pressures.   She was
intermittently diuresed as blood pressure tolerated to optimize
respiratory status prior to extubation.  She was extubated in
[**2138-7-11**] after family discussion.  She was made comfort measures
only on [**2138-7-12**] and passed away on [**2138-7-13**].

# Hypotension
Initially hypotension attributed to sepsis.  Patient required
norepinephrine to maintain blood pressures on presentation and
was weaned off within two days.  She did require intermittent
norepinephrine over the next several days as well, though this
was temporally associated with midazolam dosing.

# Demand Ischemia
Patient was noted to have troponin leak to 0.5 on admission,
trended downwards over the next day, thought to be secondary to
demand ischemia.  TTE showed EF 40-45% and apical hypokinesis
with apical ballooning, potentially Takasubos cardiomyopathy.

Patient was made DNR/DNI by family mid-way through the
hospitalization and made comfort measures only on [**2138-7-12**] after
extubation.  She passed away co
