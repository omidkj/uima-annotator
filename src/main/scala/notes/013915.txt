CONCLUSION: Overall, findings are suggestive of mild CHF with
superimposed infection at the left lung base. Please ensure
followup to clearance.

EKG: NSR at 77 bpm, nml axis, nml intervals, new anterior

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.

2. Doppler evaluation limited due to patient body habitus. Left
renal
artery not evaluated. The abnormal appearance of the right renal
waveform
could be due to suboptimal study quality, presence of stenosis
not excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59 y/o M w/ Hep C, HTN, CKD, a/w HTN emergency and
Acute on Chronic Renal Failure.
.
# Uremia/Acute Renal Failure:
The patient had been having fatigue, fever, chills, dysuria with
watery stools and decreased PO intake 2 weeks PTA. He was bed
bound by his symptoms and began to improve 5 days prior and went
to his PCP on Tuesday. His symptoms had improved, but labwork
showed Cr of 20 and BUN of 120. He was brought in for repeat
labs which confirmed initial findings and then referred to ED
for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.8 P83 BP 161/102 R 18 O2 sat 93%
RA. SBP of 220/125 at maximum during ED stay. A CXR showed LLL
infiltrate with mild to moderate congestion. The patient was
started on Azithromycin/CTX for pneumonia. The patient was
started on a nitro gtt for BP control with SBP 160-180's. The
patient was evaluated by Renal and underwent dialysis, RIJ was
placed.  The patient's urine sediment was bland. The patient
remained stable and underwent his second session of dialysis
prior to transfer to the floor. His renal U/S showed a right
kidney of 11.1 cm and the left kidney of 10 cm.  The patient
underwent CT-guided biopsy on [**1-17**]. The final pathology is still
pending, but preliminary review showed extensive scar and immune
complex deposition.  The patients labwork was negative for RF,
[**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, cryo, C3/C4, ASO.  The patient's Hep C VL was 1.19
million.  The patient was continued on dialysis and had had a
tunneled line placed on [**1-19**]. He also underwent vein mapping.
The patient was setup for outpatient dialysis for MWF. His PPD
was negative and HepB serologies conisis
