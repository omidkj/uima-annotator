Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Nsaids / Dicloxacillin / Metronidazole / Vancomycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female s/p recent R Occipal Lobe infarction, AAA, CAD,
PVD, HTN presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after she was unable to
communicate with her son over the phone. At home, her son found
her to be lethargic and called EMS. She was initially presented
as being "unable to walk," but upon arriving to the ED, she was
able to move her LEs and she was found to be AAO x 3 despite
having a blood pressure of 46/36.
- At this time: HR: 80s   RR: 20  92% on 4L NC
- Started on peripheral dopamine
- 3 peripheral IVs were placed when cordis attempt failed
- She was also started on peripheral neo for better BP control;
this was eventually weaned off prior to coming to the ICU.
- 3.5L IVFs
- Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone
- Per the family, this declined any surgical interventions or
any further attempts at a CVL.


Past Medical History:

CRI
AAA


Social History:
Retired banker.  Lives alone with VNA.  Ambulates occasionally
with cane, usually without.  No tob/etoh.


Family History:
History of Peripheral vascular disease. No history of stroke.
Son with detached retina.

Physical Exam:
T-96.5  BP-94/52  HR-100 A Fib  RR-  O2Sat 96% 4LNC
Gen: Lying in bed, NAD
HEENT: NC/AT, moist oral mucosa
Neck: No tenderness to palpation, normal ROM, supple, no carotid
or vertebral bruit
CV: Irregular S1 and S2, LSB ejection murmur
Lung: crackles at bases L>R
aBd: +BS soft, nontender
ext: no edema

Pertinent Results:
TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric  left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30
%) with global hypokinesis, inferior, septal and apical
akinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric
and may be underestimated. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Shock: likely from acute MI, possible underlying PE given RV
strain pattern on ECG. Echo without evidence of tamponade.  She
required dopamine to maintain adequate blood pressure.
Ultimately, the peripheral IV through which the dopamine was
infusing infiltrated and the patient did not want an additional
IV placed.  She asked for comfort measures only and ultimately
succumed to her disease.  The last set of cardiac enzymes were
elevated, cause of death is acute myocardial infarction.
.
2. Acute renal failure: from hypotension. renal ultrasound
unrevealing.
.
3. Hypoxia: from acute MI and likely PE
.
4. AAA: not candidate for surgery. Increased in size since
recent scan. No evidence of extension into renal arteries.
.
5. Pericardial effusion: incidental finding. Echo without
evidence of tamponade.
.
6. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: from ARF.
.
7. Disposition: DNR/DNI. The patient was made CMO by her wishes
and those of her son. She passed away with family at bedside.
