Hemoptysis

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19419**] is an 85 year-old woman with remote history of
breast cancer s/p radiation therapy and lumpectomy >20 years ago
with resultant broncheictasis presents with hemoptysis this
afternoon.  She reports coughing up about a [**1-24**] cup of bright
red blood today. Of note patient has a history of a similar
episode in [**2093**] that required bronschoscopic removal of an
endobronchial clot. Patient originally presented to [**Hospital **] hospital
where an initial CT was read as "OK" and she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vs were 97.8 60 165/46 20 96% RA. Review of
OSH CT revealed interval progression of scarring and subpleural
cystic change in RUL. Interventional pulmonology was consulted
in the ED and advised admission for possible bronchoscopy. Plan
was for admission to a general medical floor, however she had a
repeat episode of hemotysis at 2300 filling a "small basin" with
bright red blood prompting MICU admission. Vitals on transfer
were 98.1 58 147/55 22 99 2L

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is sitting up in the bed
appears comfortable and is without additional complaints.
Patient notes that she to a full strength aspirin on [**12-26**] and
again on [**12-27**] for a headache.

=========
Imaging:
=========
CT [**2100-12-29**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic right upper and middle lobe bronchiectasis, likely
due to prior
radiation therarpy, with increased peribronchovascular
ground-glass opacity within the right lung, primarily the right
lower lobe, suggestive of aspirated blood. Secretions within the
right sided airways likely represent hemorrhagic secretions,
though no enhancing or solid endobronchial lesion is detected.
2. New left thyroid nodule measures 15mm, and ultrasound is
recommended for further evaluation.

PA and lateral chest compared to [**12-28**] chest radiograph and
chest CT:
There has been an increase in the opacification in the right
upper lung in the  region of radiation bronchiectasis. The chest
CT on [**12-28**] showed severe retention of secretions
throughout the right bronchial tree. There is no appreciable
atelectasis, but I would be concerned about a developing
pneumonia. Lateral view shows a tiny volume of pleural fluid,
probably on the right, not necessarily of any clinical
significance. Moderate cardiomegaly is slightly more pronounced
today than it was on the previous study. Rightward deviation of
the trachea is explained by the moderate enlargement of the left
thyroid lobe which contains a large nodule or cyst also pointed
out in the report of the chest CT.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year-old woman with remote history of breast cancer, HTN, HLD
and history of hemoptysis in [**2093**] presents with a episode of
hemoptysis today.

#.  Hemoptysis/Pulmonary hemorrhage - Patient had known tension
bronchiectasis caused by radiation therapy administered for
remote breast cancer. CT imaging revealed interval progression
of bronchiectasis. Patient's HCT was 40.1 on admission. It is
likely that her hemoptysis occured because of a bronchiectais
exacerbation in the setting of community acquired pneumonia. She
received ceftriaxone and azithromycin while inpatient and was
transitioned to cepodoxime and azithromycin on discharge.
She continued to have expisodes of hemoptysis following
admission and underwent IR guided right bronchial artery
embolization. Subsequently the patient underwent rigid
bronchoscopy with embolectomy with residual airway blood clot
The patient had no further episode of hemotysis. Her hematocrit
stabilized roughly in the mid 30s.

#. Atrial fibrillation - The patient has a single episode of
atrial fibrilation requiring increase in metoprolol while
inpatient from 25 [**Hospital1 **] to 25 TID. The patient had no further
episdoe of atrial fibrilaltion while inpatient. Given the
patients risk for repeat pumonary hemorrhage, anticoagulation
with coumadin was not pursued. The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**]
advising low dose aspirin alone with plan to have a discussion
with the patient on follow-up after discharge.

#.  HTN - The patient was continued losartan and beta-blocker
while inpatient with appropriate blood pressure control

#.  Hypercholesterolemia - Continued on 5mg lipitor
