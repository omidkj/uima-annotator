edematous, no evidence trauma, no gag, unresponsive to painful
stimuli, shivering. ABG 7.26/60/156. Intubated for airway
protection (reportedly very difficult due to edema). Given given
ativan and started on propofol gtt for ?seizure history. CXR

Pertinent Results:
[**2126-9-25**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence for edema, hemorrhage, mass
effect, or territorial infarction. There is no shift of midline,
and there is preservation of the normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation. The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber
and configuration. There are no fractures. There is mucosal
thickening of the left and right maxillary sinuses as well as
the ethmoid sinuses and nasal passages, which could be related
to patient's intubated status. Patient is status post right lens
surgery. There are extensive vascular calcifications of the
carotid and vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

[**2126-9-25**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
FINDINGS: The ET tube has its tip approximately 45 mm from the
carina. The NG tube has its tip projected over the stomach.
There is apparent cardiomegaly which may partly be due to AP
projection. The lungs are clear.

[**2126-9-25**] RENAL U.S.:
The right kidney measures 10.7 cm, and the left kidney measures
10.1 cm. The parenchymal echogenicity is somewhat increased,
suggestive of chronic renal disease. There is no evidence of
stones, mass, or hydronephrosis. The bladder demonstrates Foley
catheter instrumentation, but is otherwise unremarkable. There
is a small amount of perihepatic ascites.
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic kidneys suggest chronic renal disease.
2. No evidence of stones, mass, or hydronephrosis.
3. Small amount of perihepatic ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Unresponsiveness:
Patient was initially with concern for protecting airway and
thus was intubated. Hypoglycemia alone was most likely
explanation for initial unresponsive state. On night of
presentation patient had intermittently low fingersticks
requiring 1 amp of D50 on 2 separate occasions.  At presentation
tox screens negative and patient did not arouse to narcan
administration.  ROMI??????d with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes (elevated
enzymes likely due to CRI).  CT head negative for intracranial
bleeding at presentation.  Patient spontaneously awoke and
self-extubated in the MICU. After ensuring stabilization of
vital signs, he was transferred to the medical floor on night of
[**9-26**].

# Hypoglycemia / Diabetes:
After initial night in the MICU with several D50
administrations, the patient had no more hypoglycemia while
hospiatlized. Patient was subjected to Q2H fingersticks on the
floor to monitor for and acute drops in blood sugar; however,
the patient was never below mid-100s. Moreover, his blood sugar
climbed over 400 overnight every night after leaving the MICU
and coming to the medical floor (apart from night prior to
discharge when sugars remained under 300). Patient received
multiple doses of insulin overnight to keep sugars from climbing
over 400 (up to 20+ [**Location **]) and there was a concern for
stacking due to patient's poor renal function; however, the
patient's blood sugar never dropped. Given this information, the
patient's glargine doses were gingerly titrated up throughout
hospitalization until he had a night with no suga
