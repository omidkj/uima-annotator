Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2120-8-16**] with DES to LAD.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53 yo man with h/o HTN and gout, who presented
with acute onset chest pain.  The patient states that he was in
his normal state of health until approximately 8 PM last night,
when he developed acute onset chest pain in the setting of
moving a mattress.  The patient states that the pain was [**9-16**],
"pressure," located substernally and radiating to his left
shoulder and back.  He had associated diaphoresis.  His wife,
who was a RN in [**Country 532**], convinced him to come to the ED, where
he presented at approximately  1:30 am.

In the ED, the patient's VS were T 97.9, BP 126/87, P 82, R 20,
O2 97% on RA.  A Code STEMI was called, and the patient was
taken emergently to the cath lab at 3 am.  He was given ASA 325
mg, O2, NTG SL, Plavix 600 mg, Morphine, and he was started on a
heparin gtt.

In the cath lab, the patient was found to have a 100% occlusion
of the proximal LAD.  A thrombectomy was performed, and a DES
was placed in the LAD.  He was then admitted to the CCU for
further observation.

On arrival to the floor, the patient states that he is no longer
experiencing chest pain.  He has stomach pain which began
shortly after the procedure, but he states that this is markedly
different from the pain which brought him into the hospital.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
# STEMI:  The patient was found to have ST elevations in V2-V4,
and elevated cardiac biomarkers on admission (Troponin: 0.31 CK
755, MB 32, MBI 4.2). Code STEMI was called and patient was
taken to the cath lab. There patient was found to have a 100%
occlusion and thrombus of the proximal LAD, underwent
thrombectomy and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5175**]. EKG showed improvement of ST
elevations, and chest pain resolved. The patient was started on
ASA 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily. Integrilin gtt was
continued for total duration of 18 hours. Metoprolol was started
and uptitrated gradually to 50 mg TID as tolerated. Captopril
was initially started, but was held when creatinine became
elevated in the setting of IV contrast for CT (see below). It
was restarted when creatinine returned to baseline on [**2120-8-18**].
Of note, patient has a history of erectile dysfunction on ACEi.
Home Diovan was held.
The patient had a previous history of fatty liver on Tricor.
Baseline LFTs were normal and it was decided that statin would
be started and LFT's monitored carefully. Home Prilosec was
changed to Ranitidine [**Hospital1 **] in the setting of starting Plavix.
