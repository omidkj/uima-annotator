   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-7-26**] 10:20 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o cva

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old man cardiac arrest w/VAD placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o cva
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 42-year-old man status post cardiac arrest with VAD
placement, rule out stroke.

COMPARISONS: None.
TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were performed through the brain
without IV contrast.

FINDINGS: There is a large evolving right PCA distribution
infarction, with significant mass effect, effacing the right
ambiant cistern and effacing the right lateral ventricle. There
is no herniation at this time and no hydrocephalus in the
contralateral ventricular system. No evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation or acute hemorrhage elsewhere in the brain. Tiny
hypodensities involving the anterior aspects of the centrum
semiovale bilaterally likely relate to small infarcts, acuity
indeterminate. Globally, the sulci appear slightly effaced,
however, this may be a normal variant, however, given the
history provided, diffuse global edema is also a consideration.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains preserved at this
time. There is an air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus
and a smaller air-fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus
presumably from prior intubation.

IMPRESSION:
1) Large evolving right PCA distribution infarction, with
significant local mass effect, effacing the right lateral
ventricle and right ambient cistern, without CT evidence of
herniation at this time. No evidence of hemorrhagic
transformation or acute intracranial hemorrhage elsewhere in the
brain.

2) Two small hypodensities in the anterior aspect of the centrum
semiovale bilaterally, likely representing small infarcts, age
indeterminate.

3) The sulci appear somewhat effaced globally; this could be a
normal variant, however, given the history of cardiac arrest,
global edema must be considered.

Findings were discussed with the covering nurse practitioner
([**Female First Name (un) **]) at the CT scanner at the time of the study.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p TLC insertion and ETT reposition-check placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old man with LM dissection s/p Emergent [**Hospital1 **]-VAD
placement/CABG x 2. Please [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Numeric Identifier 74168**] with
abnormalities.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p TLC insertion and ETT reposition-check placement
PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST 1:22 A.M. [**2187-7-25**]

INDICATION: Recently status post emergent cardiac surgery.
Recent ETT repositioning and central line placement.

FINDINGS: Compared with the previous study at 11:33 p.m. on
[**2187-7-24**], the tip of the ETT has been repositioned and now
lies approximately 2 cm above the carina. The tip of the new
left CVL projects at the upper SVC level.

Otherwise, no obvious interval changes, as detailed in previous
report.
