left. Allows R arm to fall onto his chest; when his left arm is
lifted, he moves it back to his side. Unable to cooperate with
exam. Withdraws L leg to noxious stimuli purposefully; does not
do so with right.

Imaging:
- MRI/A - Acute left middle cerebral artery infarct with
possible thrombus within the left middle cerebral artery. No
evidence of hemorrhage. MRA w/ L M1 occlusion.
- TTE - "extensive regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD"


Brief Hospital Course:
81yo man with CAD, prostate cancer, presented with right
hemiparesis, gaze deviation, and aphasia, and transferred here
after CT with L MCA sign and treatment with IV tPA. Exam notable
for right sided weakness, left gaze preference, and global
aphasia, MRI confirms acute L MCA infarct with occlusion at L
M1.

While in the ICU, he was monitored frequently. An MRI/A was
perfromed showing an acute L MCA infarct with occlusion at M1. A
TTE showed LV systolic dysfunction. Labs were drawn. He failed a
swallow evaluation and had an NGT placed, which he removed. He
was then transferred to the floor. He was stable s/p tPA and
remained minimally interactive, though not following commands.

Stroke workup included MRI/A, showing acute left middle cerebral
artery infarct with possible thrombus within the left middle
cerebral artery, MRA w/ L M1 occlusion, TTE with "extensive
regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD", negative cardiac
enzymes, lipid panel that was elevated with resulting initiation
of a statin once taking po, and a normal HbA1c. He was started
on a daily ASA, and aggrenox was started after G-tube was
placed.  It was felt that his stroke was cardioembolic secondary
to significant wall motion abnormalities.  We did not start
anticoagulation given the large size of his infarct.  Coumadin
will be discussed at first clinic visit..

Incidentally, he was noted to have a PNA, likely aspiration
secondary to the stroke. He was started on levofloxacin on [**9-19**],
and to complete a 10 day course.

He failed multiple swallow evaluations and had placement of an
NGT. He pulled this and it was replaced. After he pulled it
again, it was unable to be replaced. He went for PEG by
interventional radiology but this was unsuccessful as his colon
was anterior to his stomach. Surgery was called for G tube
placement, and recommended GI placement with endoscopy.  PEG was
placed by EGD [**9-25**] without complications, and was confirmed in
place the following morning.  Test bolus of TF was given and
tube feeds were started.
