CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: picc placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
picc placement
CHEST

HISTORY: PICC placement.

COMPARISON: [**2165-5-20**].

Compared to the prior study right IJ line has been removed. Tip
of a right-sided PICC line is in the proximal SVC. NG tube has
been removed. There has been improved aeration of both lower
lobes with partial resolution of the lower lobe opacities, more
pronounced on the left than on the right.

IMPRESSION: Improving bilateral lower lobe opacities. Tip of the
PICC line is in the proximal SVC.

  [**-6/4242**]  L. AKA & URETER.
  [**-6/4202**]  SIGMOID COLON.

DIAGNOSIS:

I. Abdominal mesh (A-B):

1. Skin with ulceration, hypertrophic scar, and acute and
chronic inflammation.



2. Soft tissue with fat necrosis, fibrosis, and foreign body
giant cell reaction consistent with prior procedure site.

II. Appendix, appendectomy (C-D):

Appendix:

No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

III. Small bowel fistula, resection (E-H):

Extensive serosal and muscularis propria chronic inflammation,
foreign body giant cell reaction, fibrosis, and adhesions, with
kinking of the bowel wall and focal mucosal/mural ulceration.
No ischemic infarction identified.

IV. Small bowel; resection (I-J):

Small bowel segment:

Unremarkable except for extensive serosal adhesions.

V. Sigmoid colon, section (K-L):

Colonic segment with focal ulceration and granulation tissue at
one resection margin.  There are also scattered crypt abscesses
within the specimen, and areas of ischemic damage of the
muscularis propria.

VI. Gallbladder, cholecystectomy (M-N):

Chronic cholecystitis.

Clinical:   Small bowel obstruction.  S/P MVA with multiple
traumas.
Gross:



The specimen is received fresh in six parts, all labeled with
"[**Known lastname 1001**], [**Known firstname **]" and the medical record number.



Part 1 is additionally labeled "abdominal mesh" and consists of
a 25 cm in length piece of skin with underlying soft tissue.
Within this skin are embedded pieces of synthetic material which
appear confluent with a recently healed skin wound.  The
synthetic material is excluded from the specimen and the
specimen is represented in A-B.



Part 2 is additionally labeled "appendix" and consists of a 7 cm
in length appendectomy specimen with a 0.8 cm proximal staple
line. The serosa appears smooth and a small fragment of
meso-appendix is included with the specimen. It is opened to
reveal yellow liquid material that is serous in nature and an
unremarkable pink mucosa.  The specimen is represented as
follows: C = proximal appendix cross sectional and longitudinal
sections, D = appendiceal tip.



Part 3 is additionally labeled "small bowel fistula" and
consists of a segment of small bowel measuring 31 cm in length
with a stapled end measuring 3.0 cm. There is an area in which
the bowel kinks upon itself measuring 5.0 x 3.4 cm.  This area
is located 4.7 cm from one of the stapled ends. There is a
markedly erythematous area with a fibrous rim adjacent to this
kink.  The mucosa appears edematous and erythematous; however,
it retains the normal folds of the small bowel. The specimen is
represented as follows: E = specimen ends, F = representative
sections of unremarkable small bowel, G-H = sections through
area of fibrous tissue with erythematous mucosal surface.



Part 4 is additionally labeled "small bowel" and consists of a
segment of small bowel measuring 7 cm in length and an average
of 3.3 cm diameter with two stapled ends.  The serosa has
multiple attached adhesions and is otherwise smooth without
exudate or hemorrhage.  The specimen is opened to reveal grossly
unremarkable mucosa with normal mucosal folds.  The specimen is
represented as follows: I = ends of small bowel segment, J =
representative small bowel sections.



Part 5 is additionally labeled "sigmoid" and consists of a 1.9
cm in length segment of large bowel measuring 3 cm in diameter.
The specimen is opened to reveal largely unremarkable mucosa
with normal folds and no intraluminal masses or abnormalities.
The specimen is represented as follows: K = specimen ends, L =
representative sections of large bowel.



Part 6 is additionally labeled "gallbladder" and consists of a
cholecystectomy specimen measuring 11.2 cm in length and a
maximum of 2.7 cm in greatest diameter. The specimen is opened
to reveal a smooth, tan mucosal surface without stones, polyps,
or masses.  The specimen is represented as follows: M = sections
of proximal gallbladder adjacent to cystic duct, N = sections of
gallbladder from fundus and body.
