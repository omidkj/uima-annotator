HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old white
female with a history of CAD, status post inferior MI in
[**2161-11-18**], status post complex RCA stent x3, status
post catheterization in PTCA of RCA with 30% residual
stenosis, status post CABG x3 in [**2164-7-25**] with SVG to the
LAD, SVG to the OM, SVG to the PDA, who was recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2164-8-2**] status post CABG, who represented to the Emergency
Room on [**2164-8-13**].

She reported doing well until [**Month (only) 404**] of '[**64**] when she
developed dyspnea on exertion, was unable to climb a flight
of stairs, or walk up an incline without dyspnea.  The
patient was evaluated and had a positive exercise ETT MIBI,
went for catheterization on [**2164-5-30**] with left main 50%
ostial lesion, left circumflex 60-70% lesion, RCA with
fractured stenosis 80%, 80% ostial lesion, 1+ MR, EF 46%.
Subsequently, the patient underwent three vessel CABG on [**2164-7-25**].  She denies symptoms preoperatively.  She had no
orthopnea or PND.  Preoperative she had complained of
episodes of palpitations which have resolved spontaneously in
less than one hour.  She reported an uneventful operative
course except for difficulty with hallucinations after
anesthesia and she had left arm and shoulder tingling.

The patient was discharged home with one week course of
Lasix.  Since discharge post-CABG, the patient reports
increasing dyspnea, and inability to lay flat secondary to
the dyspnea.  She had two-three pillow orthopnea.  The last
time she had taken Lasix was [**2164-8-9**].  Since that time,
her weight had increased by 10 pounds.  She had increasing
lower extremity edema, increasing dyspnea with exertion, and
chronic nonproductive cough.  She had palpitations and
increasing fatigue with minimal exertion.  She presented to
the Emergency Room on the 28th with the complaints of dyspnea
and palpitations.  She was felt to be in CHF.  She was
started on oxygen and Lasix with some improvement, and EKG at
that time showed new onset AFib.  She was rate controlled
with Cardizem and Lopressor.  She was admitted for rule out
MI.  Her enzymes were negative.  The Cardizem and Lopressor
were titrated up and the patient converted to normal sinus
rhythm on the [**8-14**].

An echocardiogram on the 29th showed no focal wall motion
abnormalities, moderate pericardial effusion, no tamponade.
The patient had been stable hemodynamically without pulsus
paradoxus on the floor.  Due to the echocardiogram findings
of a pericardial effusion, Heparin drip which had been
started on admission was discontinued, and diuresis was held.
The patient was still quite short of breath.  A repeat
echocardiogram on [**8-16**] showed an increasing effusion at
this time, it was felt now to be moderate to large size.

In addition, the patient had become hypoxic on the floor.  A
CTA was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolus, however, the
CT was held in light of the patient's enlarging effusion.
She was transferred to the CCU for close observation and
pericardial drain placement.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vitals on admission to the CCU,
her temperature was 98.4, her blood pressure was 108/60,
heart rate was 88, respiratory rate 20, and her O2 sats were
98% on 4 liters.  In general, she was a thin white female
sitting upright in a chair on O2 nasal cannula breathing was
labored at time.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  Sclerae are anicteric.
Oropharynx clear.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Neck is
supple.  Her jugular venous pressure was about 15 cm.  There
were no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory:  She had decreased breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally to [**1-20**] of the way up her lung fields.  There was
no egophony.  Abdomen is soft, obese, nontender, and
nondistended.  Bowel sounds are present.  Extremities:  She
had 2+ pitting edema just to up below the knees.  She had 2+
DP and PT pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  Unremarkable.  Thyroid function tests were
sent and were pending.

An ABG showed a pH of 7.45, pCO2 of 40, pO2 of 82 on 4 liters
O2 nasal cannula.

A chest x-ray on the 30th showed that the heart was within
normal limits.  Slight interval increase of the bilateral
pleural effusions, her left hemidiaphragm was not well
visualized which is consistent with effusion or left lower
lobe collapse or consolidation.

The echocardiogram results were as previously noted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hodgkin's disease status post mantel radiation.
2. Small basal cell carcinoma.

CCU COURSE:  A pericardial drain was placed 250 cc of blood
were drained initially.  The pericardial pressure was 20 mm
Hg upon entering and three after the drain was placed.  After
the drain was placed, shortness of breath and cough resolved,
and the patient was given 30 mg of IV Lasix and she could
lay flat at 30 degrees and rest without shortness of breath.
Her O2 requirement at this point fell.  The drain was placed
on [**8-17**].

Prior to the pericardial drainage, the patient was anxious
and went into rapid AFib with rates of 140-160, 5 mg of IV
Lopressor were given x2.  Her rate fell to 100 to 110, but
her heart rate then increased again.  Diltiazem drip was
started at 5 mg and her heart rate came down to 100, however,
her systolic blood pressure fell to 80, so the diltiazem drip
was held, a 250 cc bolus was given, and the patient's
systolic blood pressure increased appropriately, and the
diltiazem drip was restarted.

Endocrine wise, the patient's thyroid function tests:  Her
TSH was 26, which was low.  Her T3 was 72 which is low and
her T4 was 8.1, which was normal.  Her Synthroid was
increased, this was felt to be consistent with hypothyroidism
and her Synthroid was increased to 125 mcg a day.

On the 3rd, the patient was started on a Heparin drip.  She
was dig loaded.  Her diltiazem drip was changed to Cardizem
p.o. as she had spontaneously converted to normal sinus
rhythm and her pericardial output from the drain had started
to decrease.

On the 4th, a bedside echocardiogram was done, which showed a
very small pericardial effusion.  The pericardial drain was
pulled without complications.  She denied chest pain or
palpitations, no shortness of breath.  The patient could now
lie more comfortably, and her medicine regimen was continued.
As her dyspnea was improving, her oxygen was gradually weaned
off.  Physical Therapy was consulted.  Patient was felt to be
medically stable, so she was transferred to the floor on the
4th.

It was decided that the patient would benefit from amiodarone
therapy, so pulmonary function tests were ordered, which the
results were FVC was 54% of predicted, her FEV1 was 60% of
predicted.  Her FEV1:FVC ratio was 49%.  It was felt at this
time, that the FVC was likely underestimated due to patient
had a strong gag reflux during spirometry maneuver with
otherwise good test quality.  Her total lung capacity was 71%
of predicted.  Her FRC was 75% of predicted.  Despite the
pulmonary function tests findings, it was felt that it would
worthwhile to start the patient on amiodarone and have her
follow up one month later to do repeat pulmonary function
tests when she would likely be able to get better effort.
