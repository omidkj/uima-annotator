CTA [**2115-1-19**]:CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: Examination of
the pulmonary arterial
tree fails to reveal any intraluminal filling defect that would
suggest
pulmonary embolus. Coronary artery and aortic arthroscerlotic
calcifications
are present. Small mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are
present, but they do
not meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. There is no
pericardial
effusion. The central airways are patent. There is a background
of
centrilobular emphysema. Moderate patchy consolidated opacities
are present
in the dependent portions of the right upper and lower lobes.
Given the
diffuse thickening of the esophagus and fluid within the
proximal esophagus,
the consolidation may represent aspiration pneumonia. There is
some mild
pleural thickening posteriorly on the right. Minimal atelectasis
is present in
the dependent portions of the left lower lobe. Multiple old rib
fractures
are noted on the right.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Coronal and sagittal reformatting performed
for additional
assessment of the pulmonary arteries agrees with the above
findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus detected.
2. Right upper and lower lobe consolidated opacities suggesting
pneumonia.
3. Thickened esophagus suggesting esophagitis. Retention of
fluid in the
proximal esophagus raises suspicion for aspiration in the right
lung.









Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68yo male who underwent laminectomy and fusion on
[**2115-1-16**] who developed respiratory distress from likely
aspiration pneumonia.Post surgery, he had to be lying flat and
most likely aspirated. He was also found to have possible dural
leak and had to lie flat for more days in ICU. This impaired
mucus clearance and further increased his chance of continued
aspiration. He was put on high flow mask and antibiotics were
started. He was initially on ceftazidime and levofloxacin.
However, he developed allergic rash and the antibiotic was hence
changed to Zosyn. Sputum culture initially showed gram negative
rods and zosyn was continued while waiting for sensitivity. His
respiratory status improved dramatically when he was able to be
sitted up per neurosurgery. He was also found to be very sedated
with just a tiny touch of morphine. His mental status improved
drastically with discontinuation of morphine and just using
tylenol for pain control. His sputum eventually grew Citrobacter
which is sensitive to levofloxacin and he was hence changed to
PO levofloxacin.
Of note, his RA medication-Arava was initially held because of
the immunosuppresive effect while he was acutely ill. It has
been restarted prior to discharge from the hospital.
Patient found to be guiaic positive on this admission. Stable
hematocrit, recommend outpatient colonoscopy.
He has been very cooperative with physical therapy and is
discharged to rehab with outpatient follow up with neurosurgery.
