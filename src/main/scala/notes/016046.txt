[**9-11**] CT Head: R orbital floor blowout fx, R proptosis [**2-14**]
retrobulbar/intraconal hemorrhage, R periorbital/preseptal
hematoma
[**9-11**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis: small amount residual right ptx.
perihepatic and perisplenic hematoma with suggestion of grade II
splenic laceration (1cm). Fatty liver with regions of sparing
but no discrete laceration. rt 10th rib fx. multiple bullet
frags in chest. pneumoperitoneum without clear source. moderate
rt hemothorax. malpositioned right chest tube and OGT.
[**9-12**] CT C-spine: No acute fx or abnormal alignment.
[**9-12**] CT maxillofacial: R orbital floor blowout fracture w/
comminuted
lamina papyracea fx. Persistent R-sided proptosis from
retrobulbar hemorrhage.
[**9-12**] CXR: Decrease in R ptx, near complete reexpansion of RUL
[**9-14**] CXR: No definite ptx, opacity at R base consistent with
aspiration, pulmonary edema.
[**9-15**] CXR: Areas of opacification b/l multifocal pneumonia vs
pulmonary edema.
[**9-21**] CT Chest: Findings most consistent with multifocal pneumonia
including combined pneumonia and atelectasis at the right base
with patchy areas of infection in both lungs.  Fatty liver with
unchanged appearance of focal high attenuating right liver
lesion which is better described on prior imaging.
[**9-22**] CXR: Low lung volumes, worsening right basal atelectasis,
probable new small right pleural effusion. Right basal pleural
tube, ET tube, left subclavian line in standard placements.
Nasogastric tube can be traced as far as the mid stomach and
passes out of view. No pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly
unchanged. Left lung entirely clear.
[**9-24**] CXR: NG tube appropriately placed.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and taken directly to the
operating room for laparotomy and packing of his liver.
Postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained
sedated and vented. On the following day he was taken back to
the operating room for further exploration and removal of his
liver packing.

Plastic surgery was consulted because of his orbital fracture;
this injury was deemed non-operable. It was recommended that an
Ophthalmology consult be ordered given the retrobulbar
hemorrhage sustained. No surgical intervention warranted; the
hemorrhage did improve considerably throughout his hospital
stay. He will require follow up as an outpatient in the
[**Hospital 8183**] clinic.

He did develop ARDS and a ventilator associated pneumonia for
which Vancomycin, Zosyn and Ciprofloxacin were started. These
were eventually stopped after appropriate course of treatment
with exception of the Cipro, which will continue for an
additional 5 days after hospital discharge for Serratia in
sputum.  Because he was difficult to wean form the ventilator a
tracheostomy was performed. Enteral tube feedings were initiated
early.
He was eventually able to be weaned from the ventilator and once
more hemodynamically stable he was transferred to the regular
nursing unit.

Once on the floor he continued to do well. Speech and swallow
evaluation was obtained, his diet was quickly advanced to
regular which he tolerated well. Because he was able to manage
his secretions and had a strong cough the decision was made to
remove his tracheostomy. He maintained his airway without any
difficulties following it's removal.

Social work was closely involved early during his hospital stay;
once he was awake and oriented he was referred to the Center for
Violence Prevention and recovery at the hospital. He was
provided with information on counseling and victim's
compensation programs.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and was cleared for safe
discharge from a functional perspective.
