Pertinent Results:
Imaging/diagnostics:
- CT head:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Bifrontal white matter hypodensity, left greater than right,
which could
be related to chronic small vessel ischemic disease, but mild
acute edema
cannot be excluded. If edema is present, it could be related to
watershed
infarction, given recent surgery, though other etiologies cannot
be excluded.Since MRI is contraindicated in the immediate
postoperative setting, shortinterval follow-up CT is recommended
to assess for any progression of thesefindings. If clinically
indicated, a CTA of the head may be obtained toexclude large
vascular occlusion.
.
- CTA chest: No acute PE to the segmental level.
.
- Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
akinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course:
On POD#1, patient developed sudden loss of consciousness with
bilateral hand-twitching. Code Blue was called and patient was
intubated for air protection. CT head was negative for acute
bleed but showed bifrontal white matter hypodensity, left
greater than right likely related to chronic small vessel
ischemic disease. Patient had rapid recovery of mental status.
Neurology was consulted and felt that patient's symptoms were
more likely to be from transient hypotension and unlikely to be
stroke. CTA of the chest of performed which ruled out PE.
Patient was extubated the same afternoon. Mental status was
throughout. Cardiac enzymes were stable and echocardiogram
showed regional LV systolic dysfunction new compared to prior
exam. Most likely cause of episode was transient hypotension
post-operatively, likely from pain medications. Patient
transferred back to the orthopedics service.

2. Post-op anemia - POD #2 Hct 24.2, asymptomatic -> Transfused
2 units PRBCs

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was
voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as
tolerated on the operative extremity.
