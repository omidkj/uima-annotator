Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
Rigors, T 100.1, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
67M h/o stage IIIB IgG kappa multiple myeloma d+55 autoSCT who
presented to clinic with 1 day h/o T 100.1, rigors, fatigue,
nonproductive coughing and SOB. Earlier that morning, he had
urinated in bed because he could not get up to the bathroom. Pt.
was noted to have WBC = 1.2, ANC = 888, BP 91/70, and T 97.4.
Upon arrival on the floor, pt's BP was 79/54, and he was bolused
500 cc NS over 60 min, as well as placed on NS drip at 125
ml/hr.
.
Three days prior, pt.'s surgery to place a venous access device
was postponed because of WBC = 0.8.  Two days prior, pt had been
seen in clinic, when he was noted to have WBC = 0.7. At that
time, pt's PPx Abx was changed from acyclovir and
sulfamethoxale/trimethoprim, to atovaquone. Pt took his first
two doses of atovaquone one day prior to admission. On day of
admission, pt c/o feeling "strange" and "bad", attributing this
to atovaquone.
.
ROS: Pt. denies frank fever, N/V, abdominal pain, joint and
muscle pain, presyncope or syncope, hematuria, and bloody stool.

Studies:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2118-7-15**] 6:36 PM
Please note this examination is limited due to marked patient
rotation and portable technique. Given these limitations, no
focal underlying consolidation, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema,
or pleural effusion is identified. The left costophrenic angle
was not completely included on the current film. There are
slightly prominent interstitial markings projecting over the
left hemithorax, which may represent the sequelae of previously
identified pneumonia on a recent admission. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:  No definite focal consolidation identified.
Slightly increased interstitial markings projecting over the
left hemithorax may be related to technique or residual
opacities from known recently treated pneumonia. These may be
better evaluated with dedicated PA and lateral chest
radiographs.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ([**2118-7-18**])
HRCT CHEST:  Images are limited by motion.  There is interval
development of numerous bilateral nodules affecting all five
lobes of the lungs.  There also smaller ground-glass nodules.
There are two small areas of consolidation in the lung apices
bilaterally.  There is a larger area of consolidation in the
left lower lobe and a linear area of scarring or atelectasis in
the right lower lobe.  Resolution of the previously demonstrated
right middle lobe collapse.  The airways appear patent to the
level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.  There is no pleural
effusion.  There are no pathologically enlarged axillary,
mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.  Expiratory images show mild
air trapping, most pronounced in the lower lobes bilaterally.
Limited, noncontrast evaluation of the heart and great vessels
is unremarkable. Limited noncontrast evaluation of the abdomen
shows nonspecific perinephric stranding, unchanged compared to
the previous study. Bone windows reveal degenerative changes
with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1.  New diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules of varying sizes and
density, with two small areas of focal consolidation in the
apices bilaterally and a larger area of consolidation in the
left lower lobe.  Given the patient's history of auto stem cell
transplant less than 100 days ago, primary consideration should
be given to opportunistic [**Month/Day/Year 1065**] infection such as invasive
Aspergillus.  Superimposed bacterial infection is also possible.

2.  No evidence of pulmonary fibrosis.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2118-7-20**] 8:06 AM
FINDINGS: There is a new area of slow diffusion in the right
medial occipital lobe and the adjacent portion of the splenium
of the corpus collosum. These areas demonstrates high signal on
T2-weighted images. The occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle is partially compressed by the associated mass effect.
The involved occipital cortex demonstrates gyriform enhancement
on postcontrast images. The enhancement does not extend into the
portions of the white matter involved with this abnormality.
These findings are most consistent with a subacute infarction.
An infectious process is much less likely given the gyriform
nature of the enhancement, and the lack of additional enhancing
lesions.  Two small foci of high T2 signal in the deep white
matter of the right and left inferior frontal lobes are
unchanged, likely representing chronic microvascular disease.
The right sphenoid [**Doctor First Name 362**] mass which involves the right cavernous
sinus and the pituitary fossa, and which extends posteriorly
along the clivus, is unchanged. Encasement and narrowing of the
right cavernous carotid artery are unchanged. There is a
persistent fluid level in
