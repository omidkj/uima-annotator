Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
attempted VT ablation - [**4-12**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old man with PMH of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy x 10yrs, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and ventricular
tachycardia s/p ICD [**2131**] admitted with recurrent ICD firing x 2
within 48 hours ([**4-7**] and this am). The patient had previously
been managed for asymptomatic ventricular ectopy with amiodarone
(since [**2116**]) and mexiletine, but had first ICD firing in [**7-5**].
He had a recent admission in [**1-5**] also for recurrent ICD firing,
with 7 shocks from [**10-5**] to [**1-5**]. He underwent EP study with 1
VT site ablated and was continued on amiodarone and mexiletine.
He was briefly told to stop taking mexiletine, but restarted on
[**3-24**] after another episode of ICD firing. The patient reports
occasionally feeling symptomatic prior to VT firing. He had some
mild dizziness/ "feeling off" prior to firing this am, but
denied symptoms preceding event on [**4-7**]. He reports feeling brief
episodes of light-headedness 2-3 times daily with no other
associated symptoms. This resolves with rest. He does not
experience symptoms with exertion. He denies prior hx of low
blood pressures. Prior discussion with his cardiologist
suggested possible VT as etiology for this. He denies current CP
(with or without exertion), SOB, palpitations, dizziness, n/v/d,
abdominal pain, or weakness/ numbness/ paresthesias.
.
Of note, he had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 2436**] Hosiptal last
week for evaluation of CP radiating to the L arm. Per his
report, he was ruled out for MI with negative cardiac enzymes.
He underwent stress testing there, which was reportedly negative
for inducible ischemia. There was no evidence of CHF. He has not
experienced any episodes of CP since presentation to [**Hospital1 2436**].
.
Currently, the patient feels well with no complaints.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG demonstrated sinus bradycardia at 56bpm, LVH with secondary
ST-TW changes, possible LAE. Compared to prior dated [**2134-1-5**] STD
and TWI in V2-4 have resolved.
.
[**2134-4-9**] CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. Mixed non-obstructive plaque within the right and left
coronary
circulations but no significant stenoses identified. Short
segment of
myocardial bridging involving the mid-to-distal LAD as described
above. Global hypokinesis with estimated ejection fraction of
22%. Visualization of known mitral regurgitation.
2. Moderate-to-severe paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema.
Sub-4-mm right-sided nodule along the minor fissure is likely an
intraparenchymal lymph node but warrants a one-year followup
with dedicated chest CT to confirm stability in absence of any
prior comparison examinations given patients high risk.
3. Multiple small hypoattenuating hepatic lesions, too small to
definitely characterize but likely benign cysts.
4. Small pericardial effusion. Dilatation of the main, right,
and left pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
.
[**2134-4-13**] Echo:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30%), with the basal inferolateral
segment contracting best. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is a small posterior pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction. Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Small posterior pericardial
effusion without any echo evidence of hemodynamic compromise.
.
[**2134-4-13**] Pericardial fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old man with PMH of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy x 10yrs, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and ventricular
tachycardia s/p ICD [**2131**] admitted with recurrent ICD firing x 2
within 48 hours for anticipated VT ablation.
.
#. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient presented with recurrent
ICD firing secondary to VT despite medical therapy with
amiodarone and mexiletine. Patient was started on a lidocaine
gtt on admission for anticipated VT ablation, which was
well-tolerated overall without clinically significant ectopy.
The patient was taken to the EP lab for VT ablation on [**4-12**];
however, arrhythmogenic foci could not be terminated
successfully. Amiodarone was discontinued after the procedure,
and the patient was started on quinidine. He developed QT
prolongation in response to this medication, so this was
discontinued as well. The patient was kept on carvedilol 25mg
[**Hospital1 **] upon discharge with evidence of mild asymptomatic
ventricular ectopy seen on telemetry. He will follow-up with EP
in [**12-30**] weeks to readdress his medication regimen.
.
#. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a histroy of
chronic systolic heart failure due to non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with global HK, estimated EF 20% on [**4-13**] echo and
[**4-9**] CTA. He remained clinically euvolemic during admission. He
was continued on home doses of ACE
