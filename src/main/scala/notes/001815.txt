Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**Date range (1) 100821**]

History of Present Illness:
72M [**Hospital3 2558**] resident w/ multiple medical problems now
admitted for a 1 day h/o acute SOB/hypoxia.  He was in his usual
state of health until around midnight [**6-11**] when he c/o acute SOB
and chest pressure.  His O2 sat was noted to be 89% on RA -> 94%
6L, so he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.  In our
ED his WBC was noted to be elevated at 16 with 9% bands and CXR
with RML consolidation.  As a result, he was given 1 dose of
levaquin and erythromycin.  Around 6am, he developed substernal
chest pressure in the ED, was given 2mg morphine, and
subsequently became hypoxic to 90% on a NRB resulting in
intubation.  ROS on admission were otherwise unremarkable.

Studies:
Dobutamine Echo [**2152-6-28**]:
No 2D echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to
achieved
workload. With exercise, a wide comple tachycardia most likely
SVT, developed.

MR Hip [**2152-6-23**]:
Small right sided hip joint effusion with associated severe
degenerative changes, unchanged when compared to [**2152-6-5**].
Limited evaluation of the left hip. Status post left hip
replacement. Fluid near the left hip joint and edema of the
adjacent muscle groups and posterior lateral soft tissues is
unchanged.

CT Abdomen [**2152-6-23**]:
1) Biliary ductal dilatation status post stenting.
2) Failure of left hip prosthesis with superolateral
distraction. Severe degenerative changes of the right hip.
3) No abscess or diverticulitis identified.

EKG [**2152-6-17**]:
Sinus rhythm
Left atrial abnormality
Left axis deviation - consider prior inferior myocardial
infarction and left
anterior fascicular block but baseline artifact makes assessment
difficult
Low limb leads voltage - is nonspecific
QS configuration in leads V1 and V2 - could be in part - ?
positional but
consider also prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2152-6-13**], sinus bradycardia absent and
left axis
deviation now seen

Chest AP Film [**2152-6-11**]:
Significant increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions and
atelectasis of the lower lobes compared to prior film.
Underlying infiltrates cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
72M [**Hospital3 2558**] resident admitted for 1 day history of acute
shortness of breath/hypoxia due to pneumonia requring 24hrs of
intubation.

Because he was intubated in the ED for airway protection/hypoxic
respiratory failure, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially admitted to the
Medical ICU.  His ICU course was notable for transient
hypotension immediately after intubation requiring neosynephrine
for a few hours, negative cardiac enzymes x 3, successful
extubation [**6-12**], a mild transaminitis likely d/t poor
perfusion/hypotension, a failed swallow evaluation [**6-13**], and
new-onset asymptomatic bradycardia since [**6-13**] AM.  His sputum
culture came back with moderate MRSA and sparse [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] as a
result, he was started on a 14 day course of IV Vancomycin via
PICC and PO Levaquin.  So his course by problems:

#MRSA Pneumonia - initially intubated x 24hrs for hypoxic
respiratory failure and airway protection.  The patient was
extubated the next day without complication.  Transferred to the
floor and maintained on a 14 day course of Vancomycin and
Levoquin.  The patient remained afebrile but had gradual
elevation of his WBCC and an accompanying bandemia beginning on
[**6-18**].  Further w/u for source had been negative, including blood
cx's, cxr, ua, ct abd/pelvis to r/o abscess, and MRI to evaluate
for septic joint.  However on [**6-23**] a urine culture grew out
yeast species.  Despite a negative UA, the patient was treated
with a 5d course of fluconazole as it was felt that this was a
possible of his elevated WBCC.  The other most likely etiology
is intermittent biliary obstruction, as discussed below.

#Cholecystitis- in [**4-28**] pt was admitted with ascending
cholangitis (was not manifesting any abdominal pain symptoms)
and underwent ERCP stenting of his CBD.  Initial plan was for
repeat ERCP to remove additional stones but in discussion with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] of surgery it was felt that the patient would
benefit from open cholecystectomy and subsequent exploration of
the biliary tree as an outpatient elecive procedure.  During
admission the patient's tranasminases and bili have remained
normal.

#Bradycardia - During the first 48hrs of admission, telemetry
revealed intermittent bradycardia to 30s-40s, but patient
remained entirely asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.  As a
result, his outpatient metoprolol was reduced by half.

#Intermittent Chest Pain - has been occurring for past few weeks
per patient, but no evidence of EKG changes and was ruled out by
CE x 3 initially.  A stress MIBI was attempted, but the patient
could not lay still enough for the procedure.  As a result a
dobutamine ECHO was obtained.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed some NSVT
during the dobutamine infusion (not uncommon per cardiology),
yet his ECHO failed to reveal any ischemic wall motion
abnormalities.  Thus, it was thought that he probably does not
have active coronary disease.  Nevertheless, he was continued on
his aspirin, beta-blocker, and ACE.

#FEN - despite initial failure, he passed swallow evaluation on
[**6-14**], and tolerated regular soft diet/thin liquids during this
admission. His electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and
repleted as needed.

#Chronic Pain Issues ?????? The patient was taking oxycontin 240mg
TID (!) as an outpatient.  We were able to successfully weane
his regimen to 20mg TID at the time of discharge with good
control of his pain.

#L Hip Dislocation/R Hip DJD - patient has had a long,
complicated course with h/o a L septic hip prosthesis that was
removed and replaced at the [**Hospital1 756**] [**2-27**] after 6 weeks of IV
antibiotics.  By report, the organism was [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**].
This was not verified by B&W surgical records.  An MRI was
obtained of both hips which did not reveal any abscesses or
anything suggestive of osteomyelitis.  Orthopedics was consulted
and feel that the patient would benefit from an outpatient
removal of his L hip prosthesis and spacer with an eventual
total R h
