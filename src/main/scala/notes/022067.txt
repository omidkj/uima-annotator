Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 678**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
(Patient is extremely hard of hearing so much of her history is
obtained from her husband, with whom she lives.) She is a [**Age over 90 **] F
with a history of bronchiectasis, atherosclerosis, PVD, HTN who
presents with 2-day history of an illness which began with
severe sore throat and nausea two nights ago (felt she would
vomit, never did). Over the course of the day yesterday, she
continued to feel nauseous. She had some RLQ abdominal pain
though belly was soft per her husband. She developed
increasingly rapid breathing and cough. This morning both her
breathing and her cough seemed worse so her husband brought her
into the [**Name (NI) **]. Of note, her husband was also recently ill with a
viral-like illness, though he had rhinorrhea which she has not
had.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were T 97.7, HR 99, BP 149/75, RR
20, 96% on 4L by NC. She received ipratropium and albuterol
nebs, cetriaxone and azithromycin in the ED. While in the ED,
she spiked a fever to 100.4. She became agitated and
increasingly tachypneic in the ED, which her husband says is
usual for her when she is being admitted to the hospital, as she
tends to feel scared and become somewhat paranoid. Vitals prior
to transfer to the MICU were T 100.4, HR 95, BP 104/50, RR 35,
O2 96% on 6L.
.
On arrival to the floor, she was resting comfortably in bed. She
reported breathing was more comfortable than yesterday or than
earlier in the ED.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Complete review of systems was compromised by
patient's hearing loss. Per husband, she has had chronic poor
appetite and weight loss of ~25 lbs over the past few years
which he attributes to depression. She has not been febrile at
home. She also has chronic nausea for which she has been
followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 452**], though this was significantly worse in the
past two days. She denies any pain at this time.

PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Hardware noted at the lower
c-spine.
Cardiomegaly is again noted. Calcified granulomas in the RUL
noted as seen on prior CT. Bibasilar interstitial abnormality
and mucoid impaction has increased compared to the prior study.
Upper lobe lucency is due to emphysema. There is no sign of
pneumonia or CHF. The heart is mildly enlarged. There may be a
trace right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic
calcification, but the mediastinal silhouette is otherwise
unremarkable. Hilar contours are normal. There is degenerative
change of the thoracolumbar spine with evidence of prior
vertebroplasty in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine. Old
right rib fractures noted. IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly,
emphysema, bibasilar scarring slightly
progressed.

EKG: Sinus rhythm with borderline sinus tachycardia. Consider
biatrial abnormality, although is non-diagnostic.
Prominent/peaked T waves raise the consideration of
hyperkalemia. Findings are non-specific but clinical correlation
is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2117-10-11**] the rate is
faster, and delayed R wave progression pattern is less
prominent.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 35852**] is a [**Age over 90 **] F with a history of bronchiectasis who
presents with 2-day history of worsening cough/dyspnea. In the
ED, she was noted to be hypoxic requiring 6L by NC to maintain
O2 sats in mid-90s and had elevated lactate to 2.6 and was
referred to the ICU given concern for deterioration. In the ICU,
she received initial broad coverage with oseltamavir and
antibiotics and respiratory status stabilized. She was called
out to the floor on hospital day #2 and continued to require
less oxygen prior to discharge.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Patient has a history of
bronchiectasis but based on imaging findings may also have an
element of COPD/emphysema. She had wheezing on exam on admission
and felt symptomatically improved after nebs in the ED. She also
had dry rales at the bases.  She was swabbed for influenza (DFA
negative; oseltamavir stopped) and urinary legionella antigen
was also noted to be negative. She was covered with broad
spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin
to cover HAP given her recent admission for kyphoplasty. Despite
wet-sounding cough, she was unable to produce a sputum sample
suitable for analysis. At the time of call out from the ICU, her
O2 sat was 88-90% on RA and mid-90s on 4L NC.  During her time
on the floor, she only required 1-2 L O2 for saturations in the
mid 90s.  She will continue on antibiotics (Cefpodoxime and
Cipro) for a 10-day total course, or 5 more days after
discharge.

#. HYPONATREMIA: Sodium on admission is 131. Patient has had
frequent hyponatremia in the past per OMR records with a
baseline 133-136. Given elevated BUN and physical exam, she was
felt likely somewhat dry and received IVF wtih normal saline.
Over the course of hospital stay, sodium remained low, but
briefly improved without IV
