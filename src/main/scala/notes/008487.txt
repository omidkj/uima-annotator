Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4963**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy
Bleeding Scan
Embolization
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old man with CAD (s/p cath [**8-29**] with LAD
stent; [**1-30**] with patent stent), COPD, prior GIB, here with BRBPR
x3 episodes at home.  The first episode was at about 10pm on the
night prior to admission, and was red blood mixed with stool.
The second episode was a gush of bright red blood.  The 3rd
episode was only a small amount of blood.  He has not had a BM
since that time.  He had a colonoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2305**] on [**3-28**]
with polypectomy x4 (2 in the ascending colon, 1 in the distal
ascending colon, 1 in the transverse colon).  He restarted his
plavix on [**4-1**] as instructed, and had not yet restarted aspirin.


He denies having had diarrhea or constipation, or black or
bloody stools prior to these episodes of BRBPR.  He denies N/V,
abdominal pain.  He has been eating normally and has a normal
appetite.  He complained of dizziness and feeling like he was
"blacking out" upon standing in the ED.  Denies CP, SOB,
palpitations.  No orthopnea or PND.

In the ED, VS: 96.6, 123, 89/52, 30, 96% on RA.
Rectal exam showed BRBPR but abdomen was benign.  NGL was
negative.
Two 16g IVs were placed and he was given 1L NS.  1U prbcs also
started.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **] and recommended tagged RBC scan, and
if positive go to IR for intervention.  Tagged RBC scan is
currently deferred pending BP stability.  Surgery was also
consulted.  He is admitted to the MICU for GI bleeding and
hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: This is a 77 year old man with CAD, COPD, prior GI bleed,
here with BRBPR, anemia, and hypotension s/p colonoscopy and
polypectomy. He was in the MICU and when stable, transferred to
the floor.

# GI Bleed/Anemia:  Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding. Of note,
patient had a prior major bleed from AVM at hepatic flexure
requiring transfusion of 15U PRBC and IR embolization. Recent
baseline HCT had been variable, but averaging around 30-32.  HCT
30 on admission.  Tagged red blood cell scan revealed brisk
bleeding in the distal ascending colon/hepatic flexure.  IR
embolized branch of the right colic artery.  Post- embolization,
patient returned to the floor with SBP in 70s-80s, +copious
melanotic stools.  He did not, however, require pressors.
Received 11u pRBCs (last was [**4-8**]). Antihypertensives, ASA,
Plavix held. Pt had persistent BRBPR so underwent colonoscopy on
[**4-8**] which revealed a visible vessel at post-polypectomy site
which was injected. His HCT remained stable since. Started POs
on [**4-10**], which he tolerated well.  His primary cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], recommended restarting aspirin, which was done prior to
departure.  Upon discharge, he was scheduled with close cardiac
follow-up.  He was also to have his VNA check a CBC three days
post-discharge for close monitoring.

# Shortness of breath: Patient had an episode of SOB on [**4-9**]
early morning. This was thought to be secondary to fluid
overload (in setting of holding diuretics and getting blood) so
was given IV ethacrynic acid. Also treated with BiPAP, Nitro
gtt, and Solu-Medrol with improvement.  He improved fairly
rapidly with these interventions and did have similar episodes
during his hospitalization.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and
troponin was mildly elevated to 0.13, CK peak 120, MB peak 15,
thought to be secondary to demand ischemia.  Upon transfer out
of the ICU, he continued to autodiurese several additional
liters of excess fluids.  Additionally, ethacrynic acid was
restarted prior to discharge.

# Hypotension: Secondary to GI bleeding.  Managed hemorrhage as
above.  Blood pressure remained borderline low but stable.
Ultimately improved toward his baseline, and his
antihypertensives were restarted prior to discharge without any
complications.

# CAD: s/p DES to LAD in [**2183**] (patent stent on cath in [**1-30**]).
Aspirin and Plavix  were initially held given bleeding.
Antihypertensives were held for hypotension.  Statin was
continue (switched to simvastatin as lovastatin is non
formulary).  Did not have CP or other symptoms of coronary
insufficiency during this admission.  Had one set of negative
cardiac enzymes upon admission, but further cycling was not
indicated.  His primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], recommended
restarting aspirin, which was done prior to departure.  Upon
discharge, he was scheduled with close cardiac follow-up.

# COPD: On chronic daily Prednisone, home O2 2L.  Recent
admission in [**3-3**] for COPD exacerbation.  Upon admission was
breathing comfortably, not wheezing, good O2 sat on home O2
regimen.  Continued home inhalers (changed to fluticasone and
salmeterol as his home medications are nonformulary).  Briefly
was treated with stress dose steroids as above, which were not
continued as SOB was thought to be secondary to volume overload
vs. COPD exacerbation.  Discharged on prior home dosages of
inhalers and daily prednisone.

# CHF: EF 50%, patient also has moderate AS.  Diuretics were
held while hypotensive.  Restarted prior to discharge.

# BPH:  Initially held tamsulosin for hypotension and continued
Finasteride.  Tamsulosin was restarted prior to discharge, and
he had no difficulty with post-Foley voiding.

# Gout: Stable, continued colchicine.

# Depression: Stable, continued Remeron.

# Code status: Full. Confirmed with patient.
