Date of Birth:   [**2080-4-7**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year-old gentleman
who presented to his primary care physician in early [**Name9 (PRE) 1096**]
with new onset fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and lower
extremity edema lasting approximately two weeks prior to
admission at the [**Hospital1 69**].  The
patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and had
new onset atrial fibrillation.  The patient denies any chest
pain, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, palpitations or
lightheadedness.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 1442**] Hospital for a rule out of myocardial infarction.
An echocardiogram done at [**Hospital3 1443**] revealed 3 to 4+
severe eccentric mitral regurgitation with an ejection
fraction of 60%.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for cardiac catheterization
on [**2158-1-10**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diverticular bleed.
2.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
3.  Osteoarthritis.
4.  Abdominal wall lipoma.
5.  Diabetes mellitus.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post leg vein stripping.
2.  Sebaceous cystectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
Glucotrol XL 5 mg b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired engineer.  Works part time as land
surveyor.  Married with three children.  No tobacco, rare
alcohol usage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile, pulse 80,
blood pressure 123/81.  In general, he was an elderly white
male in no acute distress.  HEENT oral mucosa pink and moist.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  No masses
palpated.  Cardiovascular irregular rhythm, 3 out of 6
systolic ejection murmur loudest along the left sternal
border.  Respirations, lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities palpable distal pulses.  No pedal edema.  Minimal
lower extremity edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC white blood cell 6.4,
hematocrit 40.2, platelets 164.  Chemistry sodium 135,
potassium 2.9, BUN 32, creatinine 1.1, glucose 118.
Coagulation   PT 13.7, PTT 39.0, INR 1.3.  ALT 23, AST 22,
alkaline phosphatase 73, amylase 76, total bilirubin 1.2.
Electrocardiogram done at that time demonstrated 78 beats per
minute, patient in atrial fibrillation, probable old inferior
infarct changes, lateral T wave changes, nonspecific.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2158-1-10**].  The results of this cardiac
catheterization demonstrated severe 4+ mitral regurgitation
with a left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately
45%, moderate diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis, right
dominant coronary artery.  The patient had approximately 30%
stenosis of the left circumflex.  The patient had a normal
left anterior descending coronary artery, right coronary
artery, LMCA.  Following his cardiac catheterization the
patient was referred to Cardiothoracic Surgery Service for
repair of his mitral valve.  Following the cardiac
catheterization the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service
and placed on heparin intravenously, Lasix, Lopressor, and
Percocet.  The patient developed a right groin hematoma.  An
ultrasound of the hematoma revealed a right femoral
pseudoaneurysm.  The patient was seen by Vascular Surgery and
was recommended to hold the Heparin.  It was also determined
at that time to repair the right femoral pseudoaneurysm at
the same time the patient would be in surgery for his mitral
valve repair.  On [**2158-1-13**] the patient underwent a
right femoral pseudoaneurysm repair by Vascular Surgery.  In
addition to this the patient also underwent a mitral valve
replacement with a #31 TE porcine valve.  The attending on
the case for the mitral valve replacement was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
complications during the case.  The patient remained
intubated and was given intravenous Propofol and was placed
on neo-synephrine and Dobutamine drips for pressure support.

The patient was transferred to the CSRU after a brief stay in
the PACU.  Postoperatively, the patient was extubated without
any difficulty.  Postoperative day number one the patient was
doing well off of the ventilation.  He was able to maintain
O2 sats at 98% on 4 liters.  The patient was successfully
weaned off his Dobutamine, but was maintained on his
neo-synephrine to maintain his arterial pressure greater then
60.  The patient also experienced several hours of frequent
premature ventricular contractions and trigeminy, but his
electrolytes were within normal limits and the patient was
asymptomatic.  An electrocardiogram was done at that time,
which demonstrated a first degree AV block and ST segment
depressions in leads 3 and AVR.  No ectopy was noted.  The
patient was transfused with one unit of packed red blood
cells for a low hematocrit.  The patient's oxygen saturation
continued to do well and he was weaned down to 2 liters and
was able to be out of bed.  The patient was also tolerating
small amounts of liquids and his pain was well controlled on
oral pain medications.  On postoperative day number three the
patient was transferred from the CSRU to the floor.  The
patient was encouraged to be out of bed and ambulating and
allowed to have diet as tolerated.  The patient's Foley was
removed and started on anticoagulation.

The patient was seen by physical therapy on postoperative day
number three and was noted to have a slow gait, but he was
able to walk approximately 175 feet and was encouraged to
ambulate with assistance.

Postoperative day number four the patient continued to do
well and was continued on his Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation.  INR on this date was 1.2.  The patient
continued to improve from a physical therapy standpoint and
was able to walk 200 feet and it was determined that the
patient would be going home versus going to a rehab.

Over the next couple of days the patient continued to do well
tolerating his regular diet and continuing to work with
physical therapy.  The patient continued to make good
progress with physical therapy and was cleared by
postoperative day number six.  The patient's pain was well
controlled on oral pain medications and the patient continued
to be anticoagulated while on Coumadin.  The patient
continued to remain in atrial fibrillation, but with
excellent rate control heart rates approximately 70s to 80s
and the patient is asymptomatic.

On postoperative day number ten status post his tissue MVR
the patient was considered to be fully anticoagulated and
ready to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient's condition is excellent,
pain well controlled on oral pain medication, ambulating
independently and tolerating a regular diet without any
difficulty.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to
home.  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] his
primary care physician in one to two weeks.  The patient will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5686**] who will also be following his
INR and adjusting his Coumadin levels in two to three weeks.
The patient was asked to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four
weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 5 mg po q.h.s. to be adjusted to maintain INR
1.8 to 2.2.
2.  Glipizide 10 mg SR po q.d.
3.  Lasix 20 mg po b.i.d.
4.  Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents po q.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn pain.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post mitral valve replacement with 31 mm porcine
valve.
2.  Status post right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm repair.
3.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.

5.  Status post diverticular bleed.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Abdominal wall lipoma.
