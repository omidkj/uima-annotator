Chief Complaint:
Atrial flutter, ETOH withdrawl

Ablation of Atrial Flutter
drainage of molar abscess


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11270**] is a 65M with a PMH s/f ETOH abuse and a
tachyarrhythmia in the past that the patient cannot identify who
is presenting with atrial flutter and ETOH withdrawl. The
patient has been an alcoholic for 40 years off and on, where he
intermittently consumes ~1 quart of vodka daily, of note he
denies any prior history of withdrawl seizures. His last drink
was on Monday at 8PM. On Tuesday he was at a dental appointment
for a tooth extraction, where he was noted to be tremulous. The
dentist took his pulse and noted him to be tachycardic. He was
sent to [**Hospital1 **] ED. From there he was medically cleared to be
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for ETOH detox. At [**Hospital1 **] the
patient was placed on an ativan sliding scale. At 8PM on [**11-11**],
the on-call physician was called for a rapid HR to 144 despite
three doses of ativan. He was otherwise hemodynamically stable.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the emergency department initial vitals were 96.8, 142/107,
146, 18, 100% on 2L. CIWA score on arrival to the ED was 21 He
recieved a total of 30mg IV diazepam. Vagal maneuvers were
unsuccessful. After 18mg of IV adenosine (6mg followed by 12mg),
his rate slowed down to 110s and revealed 3:1 atrial flutter. At
that time he recieved a total of 3L of NS, and 3 10mg IV
diltiazem doses. A diltiazem drip was started at 10mg/hr with
minimal effect. He was transferred to the ICU for further
monitoring.
.
ROS is negative for any changes in vision, headache, chest pain,
palpitations, dyspnea, light-headedness, abdominal pain, or
weakness. ROS is notable only for tremor and nausea


Past Medical History:

S/p multiple CVA's: last one seven months ago, where the patient

packs per day over the past 30 years. He denies any other
substance abuse.

 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO   ([**2190-11-12**])
=====================
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial
appendage. No thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Normal left
ventricular function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11270**] is a 65M with a PMH s/f ETOH abuse and atrial flutter
in the setting of alcohol withdrawal, status post ablation.
Below is a problem based summary of this hospitalization:
.
#. Atrial flutter: Likely related to underlying un-diagnosed
COPD given smoking history. Patient was placed on heparin drip
and electrophysiology consultation was obtained. Patient was
taken to radiofrequency ablation of atrial flutter which was
found to be typical counter-clockwise at rate of 220 msecs. HV
intervals and SA nodes were normal, and no atrial flutter was
inducible after ablation. Patient will be anticoagulated for 4
weeks, with coumadin (INR goal [**3-7**]) with Lovenox bridge. On
discharge, INR was 1.8 and he had been on 3 days of coumadin 5
mg daily. Patient will also be maintained on atenolol per
pre-admission medications. This information was relayed to his
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8049**] who will follow his INR. [**Hospital 197**] clinic
appointment was also arranged for the patient.
.
#. ETOH withdrawal: Patient was closely monitored and maintained
on Diazepam per CIWA scale > 10. Patient was also maintained on
MVI, thiamine, folate.
.
#  Dental abscess: Pt had abscess involving molar #19. He was
seen by OMFS and underwent drainage of abscess. He was
discharged on 7 days PO clindamycin and can follow-up with his
outpatient dentist PRN.
.
#. History of CVA: We continued home ASA but discontinued his
plavix as it was deemed no longer necessary.
.
#. HTN: Patient had good BP control on atenolol.
.
#. GERD: We continued home regimen of omeprazole
.
FEN: Patient tolerated a cardiac healthy diet

PPX:
-DVT ppx: On systemic anticoagulation
