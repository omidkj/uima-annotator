Pertinent Results:
[**2139-4-21**] Echo: Small (0.6 cm) mobile vegetation on the posterior
mitral valve leaflet. Mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. At
least moderate mitral regurgitation (may be underestimated given
acoustic shadowing, eccentricity, and tachycardia). Mild left
ventricular cavity dilation with preserved biventricular
systolic function. Small circumferential pericardial effusion.
Resting tachycardia.
[**2139-4-27**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There
is partial mitral leaflet flail. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. POST CPB: Preserved
biventricular systolic function. Bioprosthesis in th emitral
position. Well seated and mechanically stable. Good leaflet
excursion and minimal gradient aross the mitral valve. No other
change. No LVOT gradient.
[**2139-4-29**] CXR: 1. Slightly more rounded configuration of the
LV/apex might possibly reflect an increasing amount of
pericardial fluid, but is more likely positional. 2.
Retrocardiac left lower lobe opacity which is more prominent
than on the prior study. Small left-sided pleural effusion. 3.
Stable small amount of pneumomediastinum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 73031**] is a 40 year old gentleman who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2139-4-20**]
with a history of a heart murmur and recent shortness of breath
and fevers up to 102 degrees.  An echocardiogram at the outside
hospital revealed severe mitral regurgitation and a possible
vegetation on the mitral valve.  A repeat TEE was obtained at
[**Hospital1 18**] which revealed 3+ mitral regurgitation and the possibility
of a flail leaflet that might have been previously
misinterpreted as a vegetation.  He was seen in consultation by
the cardiology and infectious disease services.  He was placed
on antibiotics per the infectious disease service.  By [**2139-4-26**]
one out of four blood culture bottles from the outside hospital
had grown out gram positive rods.
On [**2139-4-27**] he was taken to the operating room and underwent a
mitral valve replacement with a 33mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic porcine
valve for severe mitral regurgitation and possible
endoocarditis.  This procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Mr. [**Known lastname 73031**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] the procedure well and was
transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical
intensive care unit.
In the surgical intensive care unit Mr. [**First Name (Titles) 73032**] [**Last Name (Titles) 27836**]
well. He was extubated on post-operative day one.  He was weaned
from his pressors.  His blood cultures from the outside hospital
grew H. parainfluenzae.  By post-operative day two he was ready
for transfer to the surgical step down floor.
Mr. [**Known lastname 73033**] course on the surgical step down floor was
uncomplicated.  He was seen in consultation by physical therapy
and he was diuresed.  A PICC line was placed for long-term
antibiotics per the recommendations of the infectious disease
service.  By post-operative day #4 he was ready for discharge in
good condition with 4 weeks of ceftriaxone IV. Pt. to make all
follow-up appts. as per discharge instructions.
