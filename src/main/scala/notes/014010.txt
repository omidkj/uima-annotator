CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Severe sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 79-year-old female with a past
medical history of breast cancer and chronic renal insufficiency
admitted to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**2168-3-19**] status post mechanical
fall.  The patient had stable vital signs 150/60, pulse of 100,
temperature of 100, and O2 saturation was 80% on arrival there.
The patient was alert and oriented times three, but complained of
neck discomfort and found to have an erythematous tender region
in the anterior and anterolateral neck.  The chest x-ray was
performed at that time and revealed left upper lobe infiltrate. A
CT scan revealed thickening of subcutaneous tissue in the
subhyoid region, no abscess or gas.  Thin cuts on CT scan
revealed a cellulitis tracking possibly down to the mediastinum.
Of note, the CT scan was with IV contrast.  The patient was also
given ceftriaxone at the outside hospital, and in the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department Unasyn and Levaquin.

Systolic blood pressure decreased to 80s, and patient's blood
pressure did not respond to IV fluid boluses.  Neo-Synephrine and
dopamine were started at that time.  Patient's arterial blood gas
was 7.09, 74, 61, and she was sating 88% on room air at that
time.  The patient was intubated for hypercarbic and hypoxic
respiratory failure, placed on assist control 800/12 50%.  Swan
was placed revealing the following numbers: RA 12, RV 36/12, P.A.
36/24, PCWP  16, cardiac output was 2.1.  The patient was ruled
out for myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram was performed.
The patient was loaded with Vancomycin and clindamycin.  After
[**3-4**] blood cultures returned gram-positive cocci in chains at the
outside hospital, stress dosed steroids were administered, and
the patient was noted to be in acute renal failure with a
creatinine of 3.4 from 2.0.  The patient was anuric for 12
hours at the outside hospital.

Electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block, nonspecific
T-wave changes in the lateral leads.  Patient was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for further management
of her severe sepsis and soft tissue infection with possible
mediastinitis.

CHEST X-RAY:  Failure, widen mediastinum, left upper lobe
infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU due to her
severe sepsis.  Patient's blood cultures revealed that she was
mostly in Strep toxic shock syndrome.  An Infectious Disease
consult was obtained at that time, and the patient was placed on
ceftriaxone and clindamycin.  Subsequently, the patient's LFTs
bumped to the ceftriaxone and the patient was continued on
Vancomycin and clindamycin for the duration of her therapy in the
Intensive Care Unit.

It was initially thought that patient might have a mediastinitis
given x-ray findings of a widen mediastinum. The patient
subsequently had a chest CT scan which revealed soft tissue
stranding in the anterolateral neck as well as a widen
mediastinum.  Patient was subsequently evaluated by ENT and
Cardiothoracic Surgery.  The ENT physicians recommended CT scan
with IV contrast, but due to the patient's acute on chronic renal
failure, this was not an option.  Patient subsequently had an
ultrasound performed of the right anterolateral neck which
revealed a very small fluid collection near the carotid artery.

Per the ENT physicians, it was not amenable to aspiration due to
technical difficulties.  They requested further imaging. The
patient subsequently had thoracentesis of the right pleural fluid
which returned an exudate that was consistent with empyema.  This
was expected given the patient's high grade Strep bacteremia.
Subsequent chest x-rays revealed the mediastinum had decreased in
size status post the thoracentesis and it was thought that this
empyema was actually tracking upwards along the pleural fluid,
and was the cause of her widen mediastinum.  The patient was
subsequently followed by the Renal team for impending need for
CVVH given her fluid overload, her congestive heart failure, and
her acute renal failure, which prevented appropriate diuresis. It
was thought that the patient could have a CT scan with IV
contrast and subsequently would have dialysis shortly thereafter.

The patient's CT scan revealed esophageal thickening and
periesophageal stranding, but there was no definitive evidence of
esophageal perforation.  There was no large fluid collections.
There was decrease in the small right pleural effusion.  There
was cholelithiasis that was appreciated, and there were low
attenuation foci in the liver and kidneys that were most probably
cysts.  Based on these findings, the Cardiothoracic surgeons
requested that an EGD be performed to rule out esophageal
rupture.

Gastroenterology was consulted, but felt that there was no need
for EGD at this time after reviewing CT scan and patient's x-
rays.

At this point in the patient's MICU stay, her acute renal failure
became an issue.  Patient became grossly volume overloaded, and
required continuous fluid diuresis with CVVH since fluid overload
was compromising her ability to oxygenate.  Patient did quite
well and was thought that the cause of her renal failure was
threefold:  1. The patient has dye-induced nephropathy from the
CT scan with contrast that she received at the outside hospital.
2. The patient had an hypotensive insult from her sepsis.  3.
Patient was found to be in ATN with muddy brown casts.

Over the course of the next few weeks, the patient's renal
failure continued to improve slowly, and her creatinine slowly
returned to baseline levels and as her pulmonary function
improved, her need for CVVH decreased since she was oxygenating
quite well.

The patient was subsequently extubated to BiPAP for about a week.
The patient required aggressive chest PT and BiPAP to maintain
oxygenation and ventilation.  During this time, the patient's
creatinine continued to remain in the 1.9 to 1.5 area, and
patient was diuresed and her hemodynamics continued to improved.

The patient subsequently had a repeat thoracentesis when x-ray
revealed that her right pleural effusion was returning. Status
post this thoracentesis, the patient had one of her vessels
lacerated, and the patient developed a large hemothorax.  The
patient was subsequently reintubated secondary to pulmonary
compromise.  Patient had two chest tubes placed and chest tubes
drained approximately 2 units with packed red
