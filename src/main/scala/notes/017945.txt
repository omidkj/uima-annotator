History of Present Illness:
60yo woman with past medical history significant for
ventilator-dependent asthma/COPD with tracheostomy, CAD s/p MI,
diabetes, CHF w/ EF 25-30%, h/o multiple pneumonias including
pseudomonas and [**Hospital 34241**] transferred from [**Hospital3 672**] for
supraventricular tachycardia and found to be septic. She was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] ([**11-2**]) with respiratory distress,
diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia and sepsis with
hypotension to 60s/40. While at [**Hospital1 2177**], she was started on
vancomycin, gentamycin, and cefepime; urine cultures were neg.
Sputum pos for klebsiella ([**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 39751**] [**Last Name (un) **] to amikacin,
imipenum, zosyn) and pseudomonas (pseudomonas [**Last Name (un) 36**] resist to
cipro, levo, intermdi to gent). She was also treated with
pressors which were slowly weaned prior to discharge on [**2116-11-9**].
She was transferred to [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital Rehabilitation
Center on an antibiotics course of IV vancomycin, amikacin, and
cefepime. She was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for SVT with HR 130-160
beginning at 1020am. She was given cardizem 20+25mg and
adenosine 6+12mg without confersion. She was also noted to have
a fever of 103.
On arrival to the ED, T104.6, HR 155, BP 140/75, RR 23/ SaO2
98%. She was given tylenol 650mg, hydrocortisone 100mg iv,
vancomycin (patient got cefepime and amikacin at rehab earlier
in the day). Adenosine 6mg IVP revealed underlying aflutter
which reverted back to SVT in the 150s. She was given an
additional 20mg IV diltiazem, HR remained in 150s and BP dropped
to 90s/50s. She was placed on a diltiazem drip.
.
On diltiazem drip patient rate remained in 150s, decision was
made to cardiovert patient and she returned back to sinus
rhythm.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
## Asthma/ventilation dependence - Patient after cardioversion
required to be on assist control vantilation.  A chest xray
showed patchy opacities R>L and sputum culture was sent which
was consistent with Pseudomonas.  patient was continued on
Amikacin and Cefepime which she was already on before she was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**].  A total 14 day course of cefepime will be
complete on [**11-21**] and amikacin was extended for 7 more days and
should be complete on [**11-21**].  Patient was conitnued on
vancomycin for MRSA PNA that she was already being treated for.
Her course of vancomycin was finished on [**2116-11-16**].  She quickly
improved on the ventilator with good O2Sat and was switched to
pressure support of [**11-11**] and [**6-11**] and then tried on trach mask
which she tolerated well.  Patient was evaluated for possible PM
valve but it was noticed that she has [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] air cuff and the
pilot to the air cuff has been removed.  Not quite clear why
pilot to air cuff removed or if it was torn off.  Patient has
been doing fine with current tracheostomy so deferred any
intervention of changing tracheostomy to facility who placed the
trach to evaluate.  Please make sure patient trach changed if
need be.
.
## Cardiac:
1) Tachycardia - Patient cardioverted and quickly returned to
sinus rhythm with good rate and remained in sinus rhythm.
Patient was started on low dose Bblocker which was not able to
be titrated up given low HR and low BP.  Could try to titrate up
BBlocker if HR and BP tolerate.  She was started on
anticoagulation s/p cardioversion.  She will need to be
anticoagulated for total 3 weeks.  On discharge patient on
heparin gtt until INR theraputic at 2-3.  would check daily INR
and titrate coumadin until INR stable and therputic.  Can stop
coumadin after 3 weeks.
2) CHF - Patient with reported EF of 30%. Repeat CXR shows
persistant R sided pulmonary opacity/effusion. Restarted patient
on lasix 40mg IV bid.  Can titrate up lasix up or down as
tolerated and would keep patient even to slightly negative.  can
decrease lasix if blood pressure low.  If patient blood pressure
stable she should be started on ACEI as tolerated outpatient
given her chronic renal insufficiency and diabetes.
.
## Fever - Patient intially febrile when admitted.  Her fever
curve improved while in hospital and WBC returned to [**Location 213**]. CXR
shows b/l patchy infilitrate R>L which could represent
aspiration PNA. Patient treated for klebsiella,MRSA/Pseudomonas
PNA. Sputum cx here shows Pseudomonas. Patient had left IJ
placed and left subclavian removed (tip grew back > 3 colonies
of bacteria), which
