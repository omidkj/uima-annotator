s/p open [**Month (only) **] with partial posterior wall vaginectomy [**2133**] with
several ostomy revisions, most recently in [**2135-1-14**] who was
admitted in [**2135-3-14**] with an enterovaginal fistula. While in

Colorectal service and a Foley catheter was placed in the
vagina.
She was discharged to rehab in [**2135-4-5**] and since that time,
the patient reports new development of vulvar pain and worsening
hematuria.

Her hematocrit was monitored at [**Hospital6 459**] and was
found to decrease from 25-> 23 and she received 2 units of
packed red blood cells on [**2135-4-19**]. Her hematocrit rose
appropriately to 30 and remained stable on recheck on [**2135-4-24**].
Per nursing report at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab the bladder foley was
re-inserted on [**2135-4-26**] days ago and required multiple
attempts.

With regard to the vaginal foley catheter, she endorses leaking
around the catheter and that the catheter has fallen out
multiple times requiring replacment. She now endorses vulvar
irritation that she describes a burning sensation and erythema.
of note, there has also been a significant decrease in the
ostomy output.

She denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting or abdominal
pain.
