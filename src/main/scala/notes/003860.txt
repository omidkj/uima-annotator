Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath; transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Tracheostomy
2) PEG tube placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 year old woman with past medical history
significant for multisystem atrophy, previously thought to have
Parkinson's Disease, but found to have rapidly progressing
symptoms and autonomic phenomena, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for her
movement disorder, who has had several major hospitalizations in
the past including hospitalization earlier this year in [**State 108**]
for urosepsis, intubated, and transferred up to [**Hospital1 18**] for
continuity of care and had failure to wean from the vent,
eventually transferred to [**Hospital **] Rehab facility and weaned
successfully, who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital **] Hospital
where she had presented with two days of shortness of breath.
The patient is nonverbal, but her husband provides the history
of two days of upper respiratory symptoms including coughing,
wheezing, sounding congested but with no sputum production.  She
was advised by her primary care physician's coverage to try
mucinex for secretions, but this did not help, and she developed
a low grade temperature to 99 or 100 at home.  She became more
short of breath as noticed by her husband, and was seen by [**Name (NI) 269**]
on [**6-7**] and advised to go to the ER.  She was taken by rescue to
[**Hospital **] Hospital ER, where she received one dose each of Vanco,
Azithro, Levaquin, and two doses of Zosyn before being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] the following day for continuity of care;
she was accepted to a neurology stepdown bed.

She was at [**Hospital **] Rehab after her last [**Hospital1 18**] discharge until
[**3-2**].  At baseline, she is wheelchair-bound over the past year
and one half, and nonverbal except for an occasional word (ie,
saying "okay.")

Past Medical History:
Hx C/S (G2P2)

1) MSA, originally diagnosed with PD in [**2120**]
- followd by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for movement disorder
2) Hx C/S (G2P2)
3) ? pituitary adenoma
4) Osteoporosis
5) Admit [**1-2**] urosepsis c/b respiratory failure with prolonged
wean requiring tracheostomy

Social History:
The patient lives at home with her husband, who is her primary
caretaker.  She has two children.  She has a distant smoking
history but does not drink alcohol.

Family History:
Father with myocardial infarction.
Mother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer at age 80.

Neurologic:
Mental status: Nonverbal, able to close and open eyes on command

Cranial Nerves: Olfaction not tested.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light bilaterally, 4->3 mm bilaterally; visual
fields intact by blink to threat from lateral and medial
directions (both eyes).  No ptosis is noted, extra-ocular
muscles were intact with saccadic movements; 3-4 beats nystagmus
bilaterally far gaze.  Sensation was intact to light touch over
face. No facial asymmetry was noted, and hearing was intact to
voice bilaterally.  Unable to assess SCMs and traps.  Unable to
assess uvula, tongue if midline.

Motor: bilateral hand tremor and left leg tremor visible when
limbs lifted by observer.  Unable to assess for drift.
Bilateral deltoid atrophy.  Left hand dystonia, in flexor
position (wrist, elbow), adducted; right leg flexed at knee and
foot dorsiflexed at rest, with upgoing toe.  Unable to lift
hands against gravity but is able to hold them up for 1 second
before dropping.  Legs held up for split second before dropping,
unable to lift on her own against gravity.  No obvious
fasiculations.

Sensory: Patient winces and blinks eyes once (meaning "yes") to
pain in all four extremities

Coordination: Normal finger to nose and heel to shin, with no
dysmetria.  No dysdiadochokinesia noted on rapid alternating
hand movements or finger tapping.

Reflexes: 2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, 3+ left patellar
2+ right patellar and 2+ ankle jerks bilaterally. The patient
had bilaterally upgoing toes on plantar response.

Gait: Unable to assess

.
EMG IMPRESSION:
.
Limited, abnormal study. There is electrophysiologic evidence
for a
generalized dysfunction of motor fibers but this limited study
cannot
adequately discriminate between a process involving motor nerves
or muscles.
.
CT IMPRESSION:

1. Probable inflammatory/allergic abnormalities in paranasal and
mastoid sinuses, as noted above.

2. Soft tissue density in the nasopharynx and oropharynx,
probably representing secretions. Clinical correlation is
recommended.

NOTE: There is prominent cerebellar and brainstem atrophy.
The prominent electromyographic finding is one of generalized
poor activation, consistent with the patient's known central
nervous system disorder. The limited neuromuscular transmission
studies were normal.

CXR ([**6-23**]): Bilateral moderate pleural effusions that are
stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 100324**]
HPI: 54 yoF w/ for multisystem atrophy transferred from OSH with
