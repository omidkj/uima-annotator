History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 30207**] is a 66 y/o F w history of SCLC (s/p XRT to RLL mass,
mediastinum, hilum). XRT was completed on [**2129-12-15**]. She is
currently undergoing platinum/etoposide chemotherapy and her
last dose was on Wednesday [**2130-2-1**]. Patient lives byself and is
quite independent. She was found on day of admission to OSH by
neighbors to be unable to walk (c/o generalized weakness),
lethargic and confusion 2 days after chemotherapy. Patient notes
that she has had a very poor appetite recently and has been
eating toast at home, but has not been taking in much fluids.
She denies any acute CP, SOB, lower extremity edema, trauma to
her legs, or recent prolonged travel hx. Denies previous
PEs/DVTs. She reports difficulty with SOB at baseline, but does
not require O2 at home. She noted some increased SOB and
wheezing. She says she uses an "inhaler", but has not been using
it recently. Patient also has a chronic cough that has been
worsening. Unable to bring up any sputum. On ROS, denies fevers,
chills, NS, abdominal pain, diarrhea, n/v, blood in stools, or
constipation.
.
EMS was called, and her saturations were noted to be in the mid
70s on RA while on route to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 18650**] Hospital. On
admisison, she was noted to be confused and agitated on arrival.
Given solumedrol 125 mg IV x1 and moxifloxacin. She was
intubated for ?hypoxic respiratory distress. A CTA Chest was
unable to be obtained b/c the patient was in renal failure, so
she was started on heparin gtt emperically for PE. Patient was
then tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the ED, patient was given cefepime 2 mg IV x1 and 2 L NS and
transferred to MICU. There, patient was easily weaned and
extubated, but still confused/agitated. Cardiac enzymes showed
flat CKs, but slightly elevated troponins to 0.8/0.6. RPR was
negative. MRI of brain was obtained, report is still pending.
She was noted to be obtunded, but communicative with a non-focal
neurologic exam. Noted to be hypokalemic to 2.7 in ICU as well.

Pertinent Results:
[**2130-2-4**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Left upper lung nodule and increased interstitial markings in
b/l lung apices incompletely assessed. CT chest recommended for
further assessment in this patient with underlying COPD.
.
[**2130-2-4**] Lower extremity dopplers:
IMPRESSION: No DVT of the lower extremities.
.
[**2130-2-5**] MRI without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Lack of contrast limits sensitivity for metastases, however,
no mass or
mass effect identified.
2. Severe periventricular white matter disease suggesting
chronic
microvascular ischemia.
.
[**2130-2-6**]: CTA chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.
2. Upper lobe predominant severe emphysema.
3. Airways secretions, right lower lobe peribronchial
consolidation and
widespread mucoid impaction, likely related to pneumonia, could
be aspiration given normal chest x-ray 2 days ago. Subtle
peribronchial abnormality in the left lower lobe could also be
aspiration. Nodules are impossible to rule out in the absence of
prior study. Followup after treatment is recommended and
comparison with older study is warranted to rule out any lung
lesion.
4. Complete collapse of right middle lobe with obstruction of
subsegmental
bronchi.
5. Signs of anemia. Diffuse soft tissue edema.
6. 3-mm right upper lobe nodule, warrant further followup in one
year.
.
[**2130-2-9**] MRI with contrast: prelim report
1. No abnormal enhancing lesions to suggest metastatic disease.
2. Unchanged severe periventricular white matter disease
consistent with
chronic microvascular ischemia.
.
Creatnine on admit 1.8, on discharge 1.1

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yoF with SCLC s/p XRT and unknown prior PMH, presented with
weakness, hypoxia and confusion.
.
Hypoxia: Patient presented to an outside hospital with new,
acute onset hypoxia with oxygen requirement (does not use oxygen
at home). She was intubated there for hypoxic respiratory
distress thought secondary to pneumonia. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **] and then promptly extubtated upon
transfer. She recieved a 6 day course of levaquin while here.
Her oxygen saturations are now >95% on room air. At the outside
hospital, pulmonary embolus was considered and because she was
in acute renal failure, she was started on emperic heparin drip.
After transfer to [**Hospital3 **], her creatinine  normalized, she
had a CTA and pulmonary embolism was ruled out, and the heparin
drip was stopped. She intialy recieved albuterol-ipratroprium
nebs q6H, and then as needed and was continued on spiriva. There
was a question of aspiration, and she was evaluated by speech
and swallow and was thought not to aspirate on a normal diet.
She was also started on guaifenesin for mucous plugging and
secretions.
.
Altered mental status: Patient has waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status while here with occassional hallucinations. Initially,
altered mental status was likely secondary to infection and
hypoxia. Now the infection has been treated and patient appears
to have intermittent delerium. For work up of this, she had a
head CT that shows no acute process and both an MRI without
gadolinium and with gad. Both show no evidence of metastatic
disease. Blood cultures and urine cultures have been negative.
RPR negative, B12 elevated, TSH WNL to slightly elevated (4.1),
indicating possibly hypothyroidism. TSH should be rechecked when
patient is out of the hospital. T3 and T4 within normal limits.
This is likely delerium in setting of hospitalization and known
lung CA.
.
Renal failure: Patient with acute renal failure on admission
with a creatinine of 1.8. Likely pre-renal in setting of poor PO
intake. Resolved with IVFs, discharged with a creatinine of 1.1.
.
Anemia: Macrocytic. Received chemotherapy recently. No evidence
of acute bleeding. Patient started on thiamine and folate.
.
Hypertension: patient hypertensive during hospitalization, was
started on lisinopril 10mg daily with stabilization o
