REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   His review of systems was as above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
temperature was 97.2 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure
was 140/90, his heart rate was 72, his respiratory rate was
16, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 4 liters by nasal
cannula.  He was a well-appearing white male in no acute
distress.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.   He was slightly anxious.  He appeared younger than
his stated age.  His mucous membranes were slightly dry.  The
neck was supple.  There was no lymphadenopathy.  The
oropharynx was clear.  He had no jugular venous distention.
His cardiovascular examination showed normal first heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
He had no costovertebral angle tenderness.  His abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were positive bowel
sounds.  The extremities revealed 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
with cool lower extremities.  There was no edema.  On
neurologic examination, he was alert and oriented with full
strength and normal reflexes bilaterally in the upper and
lower extremities.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram on
admission showed a sinus rhythm at 95 with normal axis.
Normal P-R intervals.  Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His
electrolytes were notable for a sodium of 129 (which was
approximately his baseline).  His creatinine was 1.4.  His
glucose was 407.  Cardiac enzymes were notable for a creatine
kinase of 125 and a troponin of less than 0.01.  A complete
blood count was within normal limits as was a coagulation
profile.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the [**Hospital6 **].  His
hospital course will be summarized by issue/problem as
follows.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND CHEST PAIN ISSUES:  The
patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with three
sets of cardiac enzymes and was placed on telemetry.  There
were no electrocardiogram changes noted.

He underwent an exercise tolerance test with nuclear imaging
of his heart which was noted to have mild ST depressions
during maximum exercise as well as a fixed defect on nuclear
imaging in his inferior wall as well as partially reversible
defect in his lateral wall.

Based on these findings, a Cardiology consultation was
obtained.  The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization.
The catheterization revealed an occlusion of his two
saphenous vein grafts.  In addition, there was noted a patent
left internal mammary artery graft.  During catheterization,
an attempt at percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was
attempted; however, due to perforation of the coronary artery
during the procedure, the procedure was aborted.  He remained
hemodynamically stable with no signs of tamponade after this
point.

The patient was continued on his beta blocker; although, the
dosing was increased.  As well, he was continued on his ACE
inhibitor.  His aspirin dose was increased from 81 mg to 325
mg by mouth once per day.

His case was discussed with both Cardiothoracic Surgery as
well as the Heart Failure Service.  It was felt that he had poor
touchdown sites for a coronary bypass and further PCI should be
held off until he was further out from the current
catheterization. Outpatient followup was arranged
for planning of this treatment.

He was not on a HMG CoA reductive inhibitor on admission due
to a history of nausea while on these medications.  In
discussion with Cardiology it was felt that he should resume
a statin medication, and he was started on atorvastatin.

2.  DIABETES ISSUES:  For his diabetes, the patient's blood
sugars remained in poor control throughout his hospital stay;
ranging in the 200 to 300 range.  He remained on his
glipizide-XL 20 mg by mouth once per day and a regular
insulin sliding-scale (per standard [**Last Name (un) **] protocol).

Given his poor control, it was discussed with the patient
that he would begin on long-acting insulin injections and was
started on NPH insulin in a twice per day dosing strategy
based on his total daily insulin regimen.  In addition, he
received teaching on the use of injectable insulin as well as
reviewing monitoring of his blood glucose levels.

3.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressures
remained relatively well controlled on his antihypertensive
medications.  His lisinopril dose was increased in addition
to increasing the beta blocker dose.  He was to follow up
with Cardiology and his primary care doctor for further
management of his blood pressures.

4.  REMAINING ISSUES:  His remaining problems were monitored.
He was continued on his routine home dosing.  He remained on
the Neurontin for a history of diabetic neuropathy.  He
remained on ranitidine for his history of gastroesophageal
reflux disease.

In addition, the patient was very anxious throughout his
hospital stay and repeatedly requested antianxiety medication
for sleep.  He reported taking 30 mg of Ambien at night over
the past year to assist with sleep.  He was given small doses
of Ambien for sleep as well as Ativan on two occasions for
excessive anxiety.

On hospital day six, the patient was deemed in stable
condition for discharge to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was good and stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's discharge status was to home
without services.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Type 2 diabetes.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Status post coronary angiography and attempted
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (His discharge medications were as
follows)
1.  Lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Metoprolol 75 mg by mouth twice per day.
3.  Gabapentin 900 mg by mouth three times per day
4.  Ranitidine 150 mg by mouth twice per day.
5.  Glipizide 20-mg tablets two tablets by mouth once per
day.
6.  Atorvastatin 10 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Ambien 10-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth at hour
of sleep as needed (he was given 30 tablets and no refills).
8.  NPH insulin 100 U/mL syringes; he was to inj
