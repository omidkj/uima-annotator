Pertinent Results:

fundus, ?fibrotic lung disease.
.
ECG [**2150-12-11**]: irregularly irregular at ventricular rate of 97.
nml axis.  no P waves identified.  LVH with strain pattern.

EGD [**2150-12-14**]:  A small amount of red blood with smooth surfaced
mass was seen in the left aspect of the hypopharynx. The area
was not well seen due to overlying mucus.
Impression: ? mass with localized blood in the hypopharynx;
Likely small area of NG tube trauma; small excavated area, with

[**2150-12-13**]  Urine culture: + E coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  upper gastrointestinal bleed:  pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
NG suction returned more coffee grounds that cleared with
lavage.  Pt was transfused with 2 units PRBCs.  Pt's hematocrit
remained stable; in the setting of resolution of the acute
bleed, an EGD was performed which showed a questionable
hypopharyngeal mass thought to be the origination of the bleed.
ENT was consulted, and it was thought that this hypopharyngeal
mass was actually the hyoid bone, the configuration of which was
an anatomic variant; no further intervention recommended.
Therefore, the origin of the bleed was not able to be
visualized.  In the last few days of hospitalization, pt refused
blood draws, so hematocrit could not continued to be followed.
.
2.  Afib: pt previously on anticoagulation with coumadin, and he
was found to be supratherapeutic on admission (INR 10.7).
Coumadin was held, and will be held for the month after
discharge.  It is possible at that time that pt will be started
on low dose coumadin (2mg daily), as pt began to refuse blood
draws, and had actually declined blood draws to check his INR
for the 3 weeks before his admission.
.
3.  CAD: pt with known CAD; beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, and
statin were given.  Aspirin was held in the setting of an acute
GI bleed.
.
4.  HTN: as above.  Pt maintained on BB and ACE inhibitor.  BP
well-controlled while in hospital.
.
5.  urinary tract infection - pt was noted to have a UTI per UA.
 He was treated in the hospital with levofloxacin (though pt
declined all medications in the last 2 days of hospitalization),
and cultures came back positive for E coli and Pseudomonas.  He
was prescribed a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for after
discharge.
.
6.  CRI: pt with known CRI with baseline Cr of 1.5.  No acute
issues while in hospital; maintained adequate urine output.
.
7.  dementia: pt with baseline dementia.  Remained less than
fully oriented, and was thought to be at baseline per family
members.
.
8.  Code: DNR/DNI confirmed with attending and HCP.
