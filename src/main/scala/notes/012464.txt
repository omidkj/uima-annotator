Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22990**]
Chief Complaint:
Ear pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old with a history of atrial fibrillation s/p
AV nodal ablation, history of PE on coumadin, dilated CM,
hyperlipid, HTN, PAD/PVD, adrenal insufficiency, COPD on home O2
who presented to the ED this morning with urinary retention.  Of
note, Mr. [**Known lastname 14879**] was hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 31045**] (discharged
yesterday) with right ear otalgia in setting of trauma from
q-tip.  He was discharged home on morphine PO 7.5 mg q6 hours
However, he was given 15 mg tablets that were supposed to be cut
in half but because of difficulty cutting this pill in half, he
took the full 15 mg tablet x 2, 6 hours apart.  He noted that
with this, he began to have increasing urinary retention with
lower abdominal discomfort.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.9  BP 86/49  HR 106 RR 22 92%
on 4L.  Tmax 102.6 rectally, BP nadir at 76/43 with HR 80.  He
was noted to be confused.  He was given 1L NS and was given
vancomycin and levofloxacin.  He was also given narcan 0.2 IV x
2.  Foley was also placed with 1.5 L urine output.  With the
above interventions, his SBP came up to 116/47 HR 71 at time of
transfer.
.
On the floor, he feels tired and has mild right ear pain.
Otherwise denies chest pain, SOB, cough, fevers, and chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old with a history of atrial fibrillation s/p AV nodal
ablation, history of PE on coumadin, dilated CM, hyperlipid,
HTN, PAD/PVD, adrenal insufficiency, COPD on home O2 presenting
with urinary retention, found to be hypotensive and febrile.
.
# Hypotension:  Patient initially hypotensive in the ER,
responded to IV fluids and narcan and was normotensive on
arrival to the MICU.  Likely secondary to Morphine overdose (a
limited dose of Morphine was prescribed on the patient's prior
discharge, and patient states he was unable to cut the pills in
half as directed) as hypotension was responsive to naloxone.
Patient was intially started on antibiotics, but there was no
evidence of infection and antibiotics were subsequently
discontinued.  All narcotics were discontinued and the patient
remained normotensive throughout his hospital stay.
.
# Fever: The patient was febrile in the ED, and was started on
Vanc/Zosyn empirically in the MICU.  However, pt had no
leukocytosis, and UA was negative.  Chest x-ray showed bibasilar
opacities, ?fluid versus aspiration.  Ear infection may also
have contributed.  All cultures were negative and ENT saw the
patient and recommended ear drops.  Antibiotics were
subsequently discontinued.
.
# AMS: Likely [**1-29**] narcotics, MS cleared with discontinuation of
narcotics.  Head CT was negative.  Digoxin level wnl.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's Cr was elevated on
admission, likely secondary to volume depletion.  His recent
baseline for CRI is ~1.5-1.7.  The patient was recently admitted
with elevated Cr and had spironolactone, losartan, and
furosemide held at that time.  Lasix was re-started at a lower
dose of 40mg daily and Spironolactone was re-started at half
dose on discharge.  This likely expedited the patient's
dehydration.  During this admission, he received IVF in the MICU
and diuretics were held, with decrease of Cr back to baseline.
Spironolactone and Lasix were held in-house and he was
re-started on just Lasix at a lower dose (20mg) prior to
discharge.  Of note, patient also had urinary retention on
admission secondary to Morphine overdose, and had foley catheter
placed to relieve retention.
.
# Right Ear Pain:  Evaluation in the ED by ENT consult showed
trauma and infection of the right external ear canal [**1-29**]
excoriation.  CT head negative for mastoiditis.  Ear pain
improved on Cortisporin drops x7 days per ENT recs for outer ear
infection.
.
# Hyponatremia: Patient has a history of hyponatremia ~130-132
which is likely from chronic systolic heart failure and poor
forward flow, as well as his history of SIADH.  His hyponatremia
on this admission most likely also has a hypovolemic component,
as he appears volume deplete on exam.  He received IVF in the
ED, and diuretics were discontinued with improvement of sodium.
He was re-started on a lower dose of Lasix prior to discharge.
.
# Erythema behind Mastoid:  CT head negative for mastoiditis,
but mild erythema of skin behind right ear, possible cellulitis.
 Received Vanc/Unasyn in the MICU, and was switched to Keflex
and Doxycycline x7d for cellulitis on the floor.
.
# Scalp Lesion:  Patient has mildly erythematous, non-tender,
non-pruritic scabbing lesion on scalp which improved during his
hospital stay.  Dermatology was consulted and felt this was
shingles, and he was initiated on a course of Valacyclovir.
.
# History of pulmonary embolism on Coumadin:  Patient's INR
supratherapeutic on admission, likely secondary to nutritional
deficiency and difficulty establishing an optimal dose (this has
been a chronic problem, as during his previous admission).  His
cachexia also supports nutritional deficiency as a source of
elevated INR.  However, patient refused to take Coumadin
in-house of the difficulty controlling his INR and resulting
ecchymosis on his skin, but was convinced to re-start Coumadin
prior to discharge.
.
# Chronic kidney disease, Stage IV:  Patient's baseline Cr most
recently 1.5-1.8, elevated on presentation (see ARF above) but
back to baseline after IVF and discontinuation of diuretics.
.
# Chronic atrial fibrillation:  Patient is s
