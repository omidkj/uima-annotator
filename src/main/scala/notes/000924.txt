Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Ischemic rest pain of the left foot

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left femoral-femoral bypass graft to below-knee popliteal artery
bypass with nonreversed saphenous vein and angioscopy.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 86-year-old man with ischemic rest pain and severe
flow deficit to his left leg. He has previously had an
aortobifemoral bypass and a left-to-right femoral-femoral bypass
for occlusion of the right limb of the graft. He has extensive
profunda femoral artery disease and a total occlusion of his
superficial femoral and above-knee popliteal arteries. He
reconstitutes a below-knee popliteal artery with runoff via the
anterior tibial artery which was poorly visualized on his
preoperative arteriogram. He is not a candidate for a
catheter-based intervention and was advised to have a bypass
graft. Vein mapping showed suitable vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery service for
evaluation and treatment of his severe left lower extremity
ischemia. On [**2201-12-3**] he was taken to the OR for a left fem-BK
[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass with NRGSV. He tolerated the procedure well and was
taken to the PACU postop. He was managed then in the VICU. On
POD1 patient was feeling well and diet was advanced to regular
with adequate po intake and discontinuing his IV fluids. On POD2
(11/14/9) patient coded in the VICU while seated in chair
attempting to ambulate to bed new RBBB. CPR was performed after
V. Tach and PEA arrest and patient cardiopulmonary status came
back. Immediately after that he was transferred to the CVICU.
Heparin gtt initiated empirically.  No AA gradient.  Could not
obtain CTA [**2-23**] ARF (Cr 1.5 improved from 2.0 on day of surgery).
 Cardiology consulted. Echo with mod/severe LV dysfunction w
inferior/infero-lateral akinesis.  Hemodynamically stable.  CEs
cycled.  Trop peaked .34.  Cardiology did not think represented
a primary cardiac event.  Extubated following day.  Course in
CVICU uncomplicated.  C/O rib tenderness anterior/inferior left
chest.  IS encouraged.  CXR with chronic fibrotic scarring. On
POD 5 ([**2201-12-8**]) he was transferred back to VICU from CVICU. As
the etiology of the arrest was not clear and there was a
question of weather a thromboembolic event was the source, LE
u/s was performed and no evidence of DVT was shown. Heparin drip
was discontinued.  On SQH. LLE edema, slowly improving. Diuresis
as tolerated. He also developed some Hyponatremia down to 129
that did resolve over the course of his stay with appropriate
free water fluid restrictions. On POD6 he developed Afib with
RVR, converted with amio. We consulted cardiology again and we
started on standing doses of amio and b/blockers. After that he
had some new episodes of Afib all converted with amio. On POD7
with desat responsive to O2.  CXR with question of LLL new
infiltrate.  Lot of sputum production.  Abx started for PNA.
SCx with respiratory flora.  Pulmonary status improved but still
with large amount of sputum production.  Undergoing chest
Physiotherapy by nursing staff. His foley was removed. He
developed some mild erythema of inferior portion of wound, that
improved during his hospital stay. Having significant edema of
his LLE, we ordered another LE u/s, which showed no evidence of
deep vein thrombosis in the left leg, but persistent complex
fluid collection extending from the left popliteal fossa medial
and posterior along the left calf that was stable from before.
He was diuresed with lasix until balance was daily negative. Hi
LLE looked better and patient was able to ambulate with nursing
staff and physical therapy. Decision was made to send him to a
rehab based on his level of activity. At the time of discharge,
the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding
with some assistance, and pain was well controlled.
