Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
88 y/o M with h/o CABG, acute on chronic HF with EF 15-20%, AFib
on Coumadin, advanced dementia, DM on insulin, CKD stage III,
h/o colon ca s/p colectomy, recent R hip fx s/p repair who
presents from [**Hospital3 **] for 12 hour history of shortness
of breath with chest pain, found to have troponin elevation and
mild CHF exacerbation.
.
Pt has been in nursing home since [**6-1**] discharge and was sent
from nursing home today after 12 hour history of shortness of
breath with chest pain, found to have trop (I?) 4.9, s/p lovenox
40mg SC (in addition to morning 40mg), aspirin 325mg, lasix 80mg
IV, nitropaste (with relief of chest pain). At request of pt's
family he was transferred here for further evaluation.
.
Of note, pt was admitted [**5-25**] for R Hip fracture s/p Right
Dynamic Hip Screw on [**2181-5-29**]. Course was c/b post-op delirium,
UTI with pansensitive e.coli tx with cefpodoxime (last day [**6-7**]),
acute on chronic systolic heart failure. Pt was started on
lovenox post op and restarted on coumadin (INR 1.6), which had
been held in the perioperative period. On [**6-7**], he had, per
family, markedly improved mental status. He presented for f/u at
Dr.[**Name (NI) 7379**] clinic where hip xr was read as "Healing
intertrochanteric fracture. No evidence of hardware
complication."
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.9 80 130/64 24 4L Nasal Cannula. EKG
showed a. fib, LBBB, TWI V3, concordant ST depression V4 (c/w
prior). Trop was elevated to 0.74, bnp [**Numeric Identifier 31597**], pCXR - c/w mild
CHF. Bedside ultrasound (by ED) demonstrated global hypokinesis,
no signs of right ventricular strain suggestive of PE.
Cardiology was consulted and felt pt did not need heparin, that
presentation was likely related to CHF exacerbation and cardiac
strain. Pt was admitted for diuresis with VS:77, 128/65, 17,
100on2L.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Hip Films: ([**2181-6-7**])
FINDINGS: Three views of the right hip demonstrate a dynamic
compression
screw fixating a nondisplaced intertrochanteric fracture with
interlocking
screws. No evidence of hardware loosening or fracture. The
fracture line
remains barely visible along its inferior extent, less
conspicuous as compared to [**2181-5-25**]. Severe bone-on-bone hip
osteoarthritis is redemonstrated with joint space obliteration,
osteophytosis, and subchondral cystic formation. Extensive
vascular calcifications are also seen. Overlying skin staples
remain in place.
IMPRESSION: Healing intertrochanteric fracture. No evidence of
hardware
complication.
.
CXR: ([**2181-6-8**])
PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is
mild pulmonary edema, which appears similar when compared to the
prior study. The thoracic aorta is diffusely calcified and
mildly unfolded. Tiny right pleural effusion is
present. No pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous
findings are seen. Ovoid opacity projecting over the left sixth
posterior rib is unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure and tiny right pleural
effusion.

LENI [**2181-6-9**]: IMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVTs

TTECHO [**2181-6-9**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20 %) with severe global hypokinesis and regioanl
inferior/infero-lateral akinesis. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
