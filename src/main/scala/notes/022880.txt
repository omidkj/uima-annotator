Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
Per records, this is an 83 y/o M w/CAD s/p CABG, afib on
coumadin, Parkinson's, who last night at his nursing home
developed respiratory distress with tachypnea and hypoxia to the
70s, with PNA and WBC of 24, hypoxic. Also noted to be febrile
to 101.7, hypotensive in the 70s/30s, and tachypneic. He was
intubated for " hypoxic resp distress"; no ABG. His hematocrit
was 17 there (unclear prior HCT), and he was having melena. His
INR was 2.9. He received 2 L IVF, 2 U PRBCs, clindamycin and
ceftriaxone, and was transferred here for further management. On
transfer, his systolic was in the 90s, and he was not on
pressors or sedation.
*
In our ED, he was hypotensive  (89-98/45 in RN notes) but did
not require pressors. + Melena. He received FFP. A right IJ
central line was placed and he was sent to the MICU.  An NG tube
could not be passed, and no NG lavage was done.  Lactate 2, HCT
24.
.
In the MICU: Placed on vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage
of presumed aspiration pneumonia.  PEG lavage was neg. HD
stable. He received a total of 7 units P RBCs (2 at the OSH, 5
here) and FFP x3 units. GI was consulted and becuase of
elevation of INR, did not scope.  An EGD was discussed with the
patient and he refused.  This was reviewed with his HCP.  On
[**6-25**], patient extubated. Yesterday noted to be tachypneic and
felt to be vol overload. Received lasix 20mg IV x2 and diresed 1
L. Currently afebrile and HD stable.
