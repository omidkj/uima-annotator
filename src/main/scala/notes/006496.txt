Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 year-old female with history of coronary artery
disease status for CABG, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes,
atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic renal
disease who was admitted with a GI bleed.
.
1. GI Bleed: In the emergency department, she was
hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit of 20 and .  She
initially received 2L of fluid resuscitation and 2 units of red
cells.  Her INR was reversed with fresh frozen plasma and
vitamin K.  A nasogastric lavage was negative.  Given a negative
lavage, she was presumed to have a lower bleed such as a
diverticular bleed.  She was admitted to the intensive care
unit.  On arrival to the intensive care unit, she became
unresponsive and hypotensive to the 60s systolic.  She was
aggressively fluid resuscitated.  A central line was placed, and
she was started on dopamine for blood pressure support.  She
later underwent an upper endoscopy that showed gastritis without
any obvious bleeding source.   She was started on IV protonix.
Her aspirin, plavix, and coumadin were held in the setting of
her bleed.  She had no further episodes of bleeding.  Once she
was hemodynamically stable, her aspirin and plavix were
restarted.  Her hematocrit was stable at 28 for several days.
She received a unit of red cells prior to discharge.  At the
time of discharge, her hematocrit was 29.3.  It was recommended
to have an outpatient colonoscopy to complete her evaluation.  A
decision about whether or not to restart her coumadin will be
made by her primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 702**].
.
2. Respiratory Failure: She was initially intubated for airway
protection during unresponsiveness in setting of hypotension.  A
chest x-ray demonstarted fluid overload from her aggressive
fluid ressucitation.  Once she was hemodynamically stable, she
was treated with afterload reduction and gentle diuresis.  She
was also found to have a pneumonia with MRSA and M. catarrhalis
growing in her sputum.  She was started on a course of
levofloxacin and vancomycin to a complete a 10 day course.  She
was weaned off ventilator support shortly after admission to the
ICU.  At the time of discharge, she was oxygenating well on her
usual 2L nasal cannula.
.
3. Coronary artery disease: She has known severe disease.  On
arrival to the intensive care unit, she was found to have
inferior ischemic changes on EKG.  These changes were transient
and likely secondary to demand ischemia.  Serial cardiac enzymes
remained negative.  As she was not a candidate for further
intervention, she was treated with medical management.  Once she
was hemodynamically stable, she was restarted on her aspirin,
plavix, lisinopril, and metoprolol.
.
4. Hypotension: Her hypotension, was secondary to hemorrhage and
hypovolemia.  She intially was fluid ressucitated and required
pressors.  She was quickly weaned from the pressors.
.
5. Congestive heart failure: She became overloaded in setting of
transfusion and fluid resuscitation.  Her metoprolol,
lisinopril, and digoxin were held given bradycardia and renal
dysfunction.  A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 20% and was unchanged from prior studies with the
exception of increased pericardial effusion (pulsus was 8).
Once she was stable, she was diuresed.  Prior to discharge, her
metoprolol, lisinopril, digoxin, and lasix were restarted.
.
6. Acute on chronic renal failure: Her creatinine was elevated
above her baseline of 1.6-1.9 on admission.  This was likely
secondary to hypoperfusion in the setting of hypovolemia.
Nephrotoxic medications were intially held.  Her creatinine
returned to baseline with fluid resuscitation.  All her home
medications were restarted prior to discharge.  At the time of
discharge, her creatinine was 1.3
.
7. Atrial fibrillation: She was on coumadin for anticoagulation.
 Her INR was emergently reversed in the setting of her bleed.
Her coumadin will be held until she sees her primary care
physician as an outpatient.  Her nodal agents were also held
initially given bradycardia.  Later, she became persistently
tachycardic requiring a diltiazam drip.  She was transitioned to
metoprolol with good rate control.
.
8. Peripheral vascular disease: She had no acute issues during
this admission.
.
9. Diabetes: Her most recent hemoglobin A1c was 7.2.  Her sugars
were under good control with an insulin sliding scale.  Her
glipizide was restarted prior to discharge.
.
10. FEN: She was maintained on a cardiac, diabetic diet once she
was extubated.  Her electrolytes were repleted.  She was f.uid
ressucitated and diuresed as above.
.
11. Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, ppi
.
12. Access: A triple lumen right IJ catheter was placed.
.
13. Code: DNR but intubation is fine.
.
14. Dispo: She was discharged to an acute rehabilitation center.
