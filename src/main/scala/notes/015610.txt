HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2120-7-22**]  following an uneventful jump graft from the right
femoral  to  below the knee popliteal vein graft to the right
below  the knee to anterior tibial vein graft using right arm
basilic  vein.    At  the  end  of surgery, the patient had a
Doppler  signal  at  the  right  anterior tibial and dorsalis
pedis.

The  patient  received  Kefzol  perioperatively.    The Renal
Transplant   Service   followed   the   patient   during  her
hospitalization.    They  recommended  holding  the patient's
metoprolol perioperatively while on bed rest if the patient's
systolic  blood  pressure  was  low.    Target systolic blood
pressure was greater than 110.  The patient reported that her
average   blood   pressure  was  in  the  90/60  range.    On
postoperative  day  three,  the  patient's blood pressure was
87/39.      The  patient  appeared  sedated  but  was  easily
arousible.    She  stated  that when she was on bed rest, her
blood pressure was frequently in that range.  The patient was
asymptomatic.

The  Podiatry  Service  was consulted to adjust the patient's
right  leg  boot in order to off load as much weight from her
right heel as possible.  This was done on [**2120-7-25**], and the
patient can be full weight bearing on the right.

At  the  time  of  dictation, the patient's right arm and leg
incisions  are  clean,  dry,  and intact.  Her right dorsalis
pedis  pulse is dopplerable.  Her right plantar heel ulcer is
deep  but  clean.  Her right elbow ulceration is stable.  The
patient  will  continue  to  have  Adaptic and a dry, sterile
dressing  applied  to  her  right foot and right elbow ulcers
q.d.    She may have a dry, sterile dressing to her right arm
and leg incisions p.r.n.

The  patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the office in
about  two  weeks  for  surgical  staple  removal.   She will
continue   on   levofloxacin  for  her  plantar  ulcer  until
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and then per further instructions.
