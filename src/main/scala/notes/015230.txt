Allergies:
Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**]
Chief Complaint:
tachycardia, fever, tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
61M with extensive CAD, hypoxic brain injury s/p trach/G
presented from [**Hospital1 **] after tachycardia, tachypnea and fevers
. EKG at [**Hospital1 **] Place initially concerning for STE in V1-3, but
in ED here on review looked more like Jpoint elevation / demand
ischemia in setting of tachycardia. Troponin T initial 0.20 but
trending down to 0.19 in setting of Crea of 2.8 (baseline? 2.2).
Tachycardia resolved quickly down to 80's with IV fluids in ED.
VS in ED were 110/59, 87, 99.5, 100% O2 Sat on [**5-4**] PS. Labs
notable for WBC 19K, ESR 132, lactate 1.9, Crea 2.8. U/A had
[**6-9**] WBC and occ Bact (in setting of chronic foley). CXR showed
no acute cardiopulmonary process. BCx and UCx were sent and
patient was started on Vanco/Ceftaz.
Cardiology was consulted, felt no need for cardiac intervention
at this time. Treat underlying etiology for demand ischemia.
.
Patient has anoxic brain injury s/o "code blue" in [**2171-5-31**]
after femur fracture surgery with baseline nodding and movement
of extremities. He has a chronic trach in setting of brain
injury and and foley in setting of demyelinating polyneuropathy.
As a consequence he has frequent UTIs. Last UCx from [**2171-6-21**]
with Pseudomonas resistant to ceftaz/zosyn, but sensitive to
cefepime

10. history of schizophrenia, "not active since [**83**]'s" per record

11. s/p cardiac arrest in [**2168**] in setting of urosepsis followed

by unresponsiveness and "gaze deviation to the left" - c/w
severe
encephalopathy, and EEG negative for seizure activity
12. old strokes seen on head CTs
13. diabetes, on insulin x ?2 yrs
14. mild cognitive impairment/dementia per PCP notes in chart

.
CXR
1. Significant improvement aeration of the right lung, with no
pleural effusion. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Interval placement of left subclavian venous catheter, with
no pneumothorax.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]:
1. Decubitus ulcer extending to the sacrum, with no signal
changes to suggest infection within the spinal canal, although
the evaluation is limited due to the lack of gadolinium.
2. Apparent thickening of cauda equina may represent changes of
arachnoiditis.
3. Mild canal and foraminal stenoses at L5-S1 level.
.
MR Hip:
1. The left ischial decubitus ulcer extends to the left ischial
tuberosity, with edema of the adjacent bone marrow. This finding
is suspicious for osteomyelitis, although contrast could not be
administered due to low GFR.
2. Sacral decubitus ulcer, extending to the coccyx, with mild
marrow edema of the coccyx. This finding raises concern for
osteomyelitis at this locale as well.
3. Large fluid collection of the left medial thigh proximally,
which likely represents a hematoma, stable.
4. Intramedullary rod of the left femur, with edema of the
surrounding adjacent muscles. This edema is likely related to
post-operative atrophy or change.
5. The lower most portion of the known abdominal aortic aneurysm
is visualized.
6. Evidence of fecal impaction.
.
ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular
block.
Extensive anterolateral myocardial infarction. Compared to
previous tracing
of [**2171-6-30**] the heart rate has increased. Otherwise, multiple
abnormalities as
noted persist without major change.
.
ECG:
Sinus rhythm
Ventricular premature complex
Left anterior fascicular block
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Anterior myocardial infarct, age indeterminate
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with prolonged Q-Tc interval -
may be due in
part to left ventricular hypertrophy and/or ischemia
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2171-8-15**], ventricular ectopy present


Brief Hospital Course:
#) Fever with decubitus ulcers and MR evidence of osteomyelitis:
fever resolved in the ICU with empiric broad spectrum
antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.  A biopsy was
considered for determination of osteomyelitis pathogen, but the
risks were felt to outweigh the benefits and given swab culture
results he should be treated with vancomycin for 6 weeks.
He was seen by plastic surgery and [**Date Range **] care who recommended
conservative management with wet to dry dressing, airbed, and
frequent turning.
.
Although sputum cx grew pseudomonas, CXR did not show evidence
of pneumonia thus this is most likely chronic colonization.  U/A
shows evidence of UTI and yeast grew in cultures, so foley
changed on day of discharge.
.
# Tachycardia, ST elevations, CAD.
EKG felt to be J-point elevation, cardiac enzymes were trending
down.  Cardiology consulted and felt patient may have demand
ischaemia.  As patient has a reported allergy to beta-blockers,
he was maintained on aspirin and a statin for his coronary
artery disease.
.
#) Tachypnea: resolved without intervention. no sign of
pneumonia on CXR, no evidence of PE and patient is on
prophylaxis at [**Hospital1 **].  He was initially on pressure support
ventilation and then maintained on the floor with trach mask
with 40% FiO2.  He was given a scopolamine patch and albuterol
nebulizer.  He required hourly suctioning which should be
continued at rehab, started on acetyl
