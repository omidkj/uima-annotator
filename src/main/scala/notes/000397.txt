Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p septal ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ETOH septal ablation
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
69 yo lady with h/o CAD (one vessel dz), diastolic CHF,
longstanding HTN, obesity, PBC, DJD admitted s/p etoh septal
ablation of LVOT obstruction. Patient was first diagnosed with
LVOT obstruction in [**2-25**] when she was admitted for chest
pressure and shortness of breath. Patient notes longstanding
chest pressure symptoms that have been present for more than 10
years. She says that she has diffuse chest pressure over her mid
sternum, poorly localized, not associated with any other
symptoms such as sob, diaphoresis, radiation. Her first cardiac
cath in [**2156**] revealed clean coronaries. In terms of her sob, she
reports symptoms starting in [**2-25**] where she could only walk 20
yards before having to stop to cath her breath. Also sob with
walking [**12-25**] stairs. She reports sleeping in a recliner with her
feet elevated, "can't breath" if lying flat. She states that she
was diagnosed with HTN at 15 and has been "well controlled"
however does not check her BP at home. She was admitted [**2090-3-17**]
with chest pressure, sob, LE edema. It was felt that her SOB was
likely due to diastolic dysfuntion with CHF exacerbation due to
Prednisone, dietary indescretion, and poorly controlled HTN. She
was diuresed with Lasix and sent home with outpatient follow up
of her LVOT obstruction.
Most recently, she was referred for a diagnostic catheterization
at [**Hospital6 **] on [**2168-5-30**].  During the
procedure it was noted that her LAD had a 50% lesion and
confirmed the left ventricular outflow obstruction (50mmHg). She
is now admitted for elective septal ablation and LAD stenting.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient talkative and feeling well,
no sob or chest pain. Lying flat, having some back pain, groin
site minimally painful. ROS negative for F/C/S, no N/V/D, no
other recent  illnesses.

.
ECHO ([**2168-6-16**])Pre-Ablation:There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
There is a severe resting left ventricular outflow
tract/midcavity obstruction (125 mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
ECHO ([**2168-6-16**])Post-Ablation:Post ethanol injection into the
third septal perforator (2 injections) and the second septal
perforator (1 injection), the resting intracavity pressure
gradient is 24 mmHg. Compared to the previous study prior to
ethanol injection, the intracavbity gradient is greatly reduced.

.
Cardiac Cath ([**2168-6-16**]):One vessel coronary artery disease.
Elevated left-sided filling pressures at rest. Dynamic left
ventricular outflow tract gradient of 20-30 mmHg at rest and >
90 mmHg with valsalva manuever, post-PVC, and dobutamine
infusion. Successful alcohol septal ablation with decrease in
the left ventricular outflow gradient to < 25mmHg with
dobutamine infusion.
.
Cardiac Cath [**2168-6-20**]: 1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Resting LVOT gradient present on day#4 post alcohol septal
ablation.
4. Successful stenting of the mid LAD.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 69yo F with CAD (70% mid LAD), HTN, CHF, MMP
underwent cardiac catheterization on [**6-16**] for septal ablation to
relieve left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. The LVOT
gradient was 80-90 mmHg on dobutamine infusion prior to ablation
and 25 mmHg post ablation, both measured during the procedure
(see results section). A 70% concentric hazy lesion of the LAD
was also noted during this procedure (and was known prior to
admission). On [**6-20**] she underwent a second cardiac
catheterization for elective stenting of the LAD lesion with a
drug eluting Cypher stent. Her creatinine was slightly above
baseline on admission and she received renal protection prior
catheterization with mucomyst and iv fluids with bicarb.
During her hospitalization, she had native sinus bradycardia and
was discharged on half her previous dose of her outpatient
atenolol. Her verapamil was discontinued because of it's nodal
blocking properties, and for blood pressure control, she was
switched to amlodipine 10 mg daily.
