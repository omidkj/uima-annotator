History of Present Illness:
54F with HIV (off ART now) c/b OI, CKD, DM, Hepatitis C,
recurrent UTI, and h/o cocaine/opiate abuse with recent cocaine
relapse, presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab with recurrent CoNS
bacteremia, C. Diff. infection, and acute mental status changes.
Patient recently presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**7-11**] with severe
desquamating rash and was transferred to [**Hospital1 112**] burn unit with a
question of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Syndrome. Rash was determined to
desquamating lichenoid hypersensitivity rxn likely related to
ARVs, cephalosporins, and/or drugs of abuse, which was treated
by stopping ART and cephalosporins and applying topical
clobetasol. She had marked improvement of her skin lesions and
was HD stable, so was transferred to the floor on [**7-16**] with
aggressive wound care. She was noted to have a pruritic macular
rash on [**7-29**] in setting of re-starting her ARVs on her torso,
arms, and back with no mucosal involvement or desquamation, so
ARVs were immediately stopped. She was seen by allergy that
thought she may be experiencing drug-induced lupus secondary to
increased hydralazine dose, which was also held. Notably, she
also developed a CoNS line infection at [**Hospital1 112**] with positive blood
cx w/GPC in clusters and subsequent Tx with vanco. She was
transferred to [**Hospital **] rehab on [**7-31**] and placed on PO vanco.
At [**Hospital1 **], notable events included:
* She developed a second CoNS line infection in the setting of
fevers and chills on [**8-3**] with positive cxs for GPC in clusters.
She was started on IV vancomycin (they did not pull the line at
that time)
* They were planning on ECHO for concern of endocarditis, but
have not done yet.
* ?cushings from clobetasol withdrawal after DRV/r/ABC/3TC was
started, so ART was again stopped
* Multiple electrolyte abnormalities (low mg, K, PO4), corrected
at time of transfer.
* She was transfused at [**Hospital1 **] for HCT down to 23 and now 30.
* Developed fever and diarrhea - started on PO vancomycin in the
setting of positive C Diff stool cxs
* She is still having diarrhea despite ongoing PO vancomycin.
* Developed chest pain early this week, better with SLNTG,
trop 0.04. See by cardiology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4610**] who reportedly rec'd

ETT and she was given an appointment to follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 437**].
* She has developed delirium and hallucinations and pulled her
own line (I think she has had similar episodes in the past, but
needs to be evaluated)
* Has has had pain in her hips thought be musculoskeletal.
She was ultimately transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for therapy of bactermia,
c. diff, and altered mental status.
On arrival to the floor, the patient was unable to recount her
history or communicate as she was moaning in pain.
