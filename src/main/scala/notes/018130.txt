History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72yoF with h/o HTN and DM who is not currently getting
regular medical care who is brought in today after being less
responsive at home for 2 days.  She was seen normal at 9:30 am
on Monday.  her husband then came home at 2:30 pm and she did
not greet him as usual.  Eventually, after he called multiple
times, she came to the front door, but had her face covered with
a napkin.  She did not speak. When he asked what was wrong, she
just stared at him, then walked back to the living room and lay
down.  She was walking well at that point.  Since then, he
reports she has not spoken at all.  She also wouldn't eat or
drink and according to the husband, she was not moving any of
her extremities.  The only movement she had was a tremor that
comes in her right arm with stimulation which is suppressible.
She was awake, but did not want to do anything.  He tried to
give her juice and water but was not very successful.  On one
attempt, she actually vomited with the juice.  She was in bed
this whole time and he would sit her up to try and feed her.
She had no BMs and to urinate, he picked her up and put her on a
bucket beside the bed. She had no incontinence.
.
  He reports he would have brought her in sooner, but his
friends told him to wait it out and she might get better.  He
got too worried today and called EMS at 11 am.  She came here
and had a stat head CT which shows a large hypodensity in the
superior R MCA territory. She has a slight midline shift due to
mild edema.  She is minimally responsive.  She was found to have
a fever to 101 and a WBC ct of 18.2.  She was also found to have
a glucose of 459.  The remainder of her labs are unremarkable.
.
  In the field, her FS was 460.  She is not talking and is
minimally responsive.  Again, at baseline, she is normal and
independent of all ADLs.
.
ROS: Patient unable. Husband says no recent fever, infection,
HA, dizziness, LH, CP/SOB. She has not had nausea, but did have
some vomiting on Monday when the husband tried to feed her some

Radiologic Data
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW)  [**2189-6-3**] 6:39 PM
AP UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The apical regions are
obscured by the patients head. The heart is normal in size. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The lungs are
clear. There may be very mild left basilar atelectasis. No
pleural effusions are seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.
.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-6-3**] 5:13 PM
IMPRESSION: Large right cerebral infarction involving the brain
parenchyma supplied by the anterior division of the middle
cerebral artery. A small focus of signal abnormality within the
left cerebellar hemisphere may represent a subacute infarct
versus T2 artifact. MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates
marked attenuation within the anterior division MCA branches. No
focal areas of hemorrhage are seen on gradient echo images.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-6-3**] 1:49 PM
IMPRESSION: Right middle cerebral arterial territory infarction,
involving the superior division.
.
ECG [**2189-6-3**] 11:58:38 PM
Sinus rhythm. Atrial premature beats. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing no significant change.

.
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2189-6-4**] 10:01 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of carotid disease bilaterally.
.
ECHO (TTE) [**2189-6-4**]
Conclusions:
1. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
2D, color
Doppler or saline contrast.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2189-6-5**] 11:42 AM
Cardiac, mediastinal, hilar contours are normal. The lungs are
essentially clear. An NG tube is seen with its tip terminating
within the stomach. No other changes since the prior
examination.
.
EEG [**2189-6-6**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in
wakefulness
progressing to drowsiness due to the absence of the background
rhythm in the right hemisphere. This finding suggests deep
subcortical lesion projecting to the entire right hemisphere.
There were no clear epileptiform discharges recorded. The slow
and disorganized background rhythm represents a mild
encephalopathy. Periods of EMG artifact obscured the EEG
interpretation in this recording.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2189-6-7**] 11:22 AM
IMPRESSION: Significant increase in the territory of hypodensity
in the right frontal, parietal, a
