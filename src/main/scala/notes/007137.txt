Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome - s/p 2 previous colon cancers in the right colon
and the transverse colon.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open completion abdominal colectomy with ileal pouch to distal
sigmoid

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 24214**] is a 64-year-old gentleman who has a complicated
past medical
history including a kidney [**Known lastname **] in [**2103**], a colectomy in
[**2112**] for right colon cancer, and a subsequent new colon cancer
in
[**2114**], for which he had a transverse colectomy.  He does recall
being told that perhaps he should have his full colon out at
that
time, but elected not to do that at such time.  Because of two
cancers within
two years, he was evaluated and found to be positive for [**Doctor Last Name **]
syndrome.  His last colonoscopy was in [**2115-10-10**].  He had
gastritis and duodenitis, but no new polypoid lesions in his
colon.  Patient presents today for open completion abdominal
colectomy with ileal pouch to distal sigmoid.

IMAGING STUDIES:

TEE ([**2116-5-13**]):
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the right atrium or the right
atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection velocity is
good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch,
and simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial
appendage, but no thrombus seen. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus seen in LA/RA/RAA. Complex/mobile atheroma in the
aortic arch Mild mitral regurgitation.

CXR [**2116-5-8**]:
FINDINGS: A radiograph centered at the thoracolumbar junction
was obtained
for evaluation of a nasogastric tube, which terminates within
the proximal
stomach. The side port is not well visualized but may be
proximal to the GE junction. Heart is mildly enlarged, and note
is made of bibasilar patchy and linear atelectasis.

CXR [**2116-5-11**]:
FINDINGS:
An ill-defined opacity in the right infrahilar region is likely
an
atelectasis. There is no evidence to suggest pulmonary edema.
There is no
pleural abnormality. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours
are stable.

IMPRESSION: An ill-defined opacity in the right infrahilar lung
is likely an atelectasis. Attention is required on follow up
radiograph if there is any linical concern for lung infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the OR for a completion colectomy with
j-pouch ileorectal anastomosis for [**Doctor Last Name **] syndrome. He initially
tolerated the procedure well. See the separately-dictated
operative note for details.

Transfer to the ICU for difficult to control atrial fibrillation
ICU COURSE

NEURO/PAIN: The patient's pain was initially well-controlled on
dilaudid PCA. By POD#4, the PCA was discontinued, and his pain
was controlled on only acetaminophen.

#Atrial Fibrillation: On POD#3, the patient had an episode of
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, after
having missed a dose of his metoprolol; this resolved with iv
metoprolol, and his po metoprolol was re-dosed to TID to provide
better control. The next day, he went into afib again, and was
rate controlled with iv metoprolol; by this time, the patient
was having nausea and emesis with gastric distension likely
secondary to ileus, and it was thought that his PO metoprolol
was not being absorbed. By POD#5, after continued afib with
occasional tachycardia to the 130s, it was decided to transfer
the patient to the ICU for rate control with esmolol and
diltiazem drips. His HR was well-controlled on these agents, but
he remained in afib. The drips were eventually stopped and the
patient was maxed out on PO metoprolol.  He was started on a
heparin gtt in preparation for possible cardioversion.
Cardiology followed and it was recommended that he start an amio
gtt to improve chances of successfull cardioversion.  A TEE was
performed on [**2116-5-14**] which was negative for intracardiac
thrombus.  He underwent cardioversion on [**2116-5-15**].  He will be
continued on an amiodarone taper until he follows up with his
outpatient cardiologist.  Additionally, reccommendations of
placing patient on metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily instead of
50 mg metoprolol tartrate TID.
-Amiodarone taper:  400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 weeks/200 mg PO BID for 2
weeks/100 mg [**Hospital1 **] for 2 weeks.  Plan for follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks and to continue coumadin.
-currently on heparin gtt bridge while INR becomes therepeutic

# UTI: The patient was found to have low-grade fevers to 100.4
during his ICU stay.  He was cultured and was ultimately found
to have a pan-sensitive E. Coli UTI.  He was initially started
on IV ceftrixone, but this was switched to PO cefpodoxime for a
planned 2-week course.
-Day 1 of treatment [**2116-5-13**]

# [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD: The patient has a history of renal [**Last Name (un) **] for
APCKD.  The patient is status-post renal [**Last Name (un) **], and he was
maintained on his cellcept, cyclosporin, and prednisone in
consultation with the nephrology [**Last Name (un) **] service. His doses
were adjusted appropriately per his cyclosporin levels, and the
routes of administration appropriately changed when his diet
order was changed to NPO: when NPO, his prednisone was changed
to iv methylprednisolo
