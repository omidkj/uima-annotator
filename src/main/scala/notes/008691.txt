Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
60M s/p wittnessed seizure while at homeless shelter and then
fell to ground

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
The Pt is a 60y/o M with a PMH of CHF, seizures transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of left frontal IPH and right [**Doctor First Name 15799**] EDH.
The patient was found to have a witnessed seizure in bed at
homeless shelter. He was taken to [**Hospital1 8**] where a CT showed
bleed and he was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation. In
ED initial vitals, T 102.8, BP 124/84, HR 16, O2 sat 97% 2L NC.
The patient was intubated for airway protection. CT scan was
repeated showing an intraparenchymal bleed L>R and epidural
bleed of R occipital region. He was loaded with dilantin and
neurosurgery consultation was obtained, recommending medical
management. He was given levaquin and flagyl for suspected
retrocardiac opacity.

[**2184-9-24**] CT Head with reconstruction
IMPRESSION:
1. The appearances of the right posterior fossa extra-axial most
likely an
epidural hematoma and bilateral frontal and left temporal
subarachnoid blood as well as intraparenchymal blood in the left
frontal lobe has not changed. Chronic infarcts are again
visualized.
2. Normal CT angiography of the head for stenosis or occlusion.

3. The transverse sinuses are not well visualized. This could be
related to the acquisition obtained during the arterial phase.
However, given the
presence of epidural hematoma and fracture in the right
occipital bone
evaluation of right transverse sinus may be required but could
not be
evaluated on the current study. If clinically indicated a CT
venography of
the head can be obtained.

[**2184-9-24**] CT C spine
1. Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine as described
above with no
acute spinal fracture.
2. Centrilobular emphysema.
3. Right occipital fracture, refer to CT head report from same
date
4. Right sided subcutaneous cystic lesion, perhaps a sebaceous
cyst.

CXR [**2184-9-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube tip in satisfactory position.
2. Feeding tube side port appears to be in the distal esophagus
and should be advanced. The distal tip of the feeding tube is
not visualized.
3. Dense retrocardiac consolidation could represent atelectasis
or perhaps
aspiration. Probable right pleural effusion. Dedicated PA and
lateral views of the chest are recommended when the patient is
in stable condition.

Repeat CT head [**9-25**] IMPRESSION:
1. Small amount of new hemorrage layering along the tentorium.
2. New sinus disease since recent comparison with air-fluid
level suggesting acute sinusitis.
3. Right occipital fracture with no interval growth of a
presumed venous
epidural hematoma.
4. Small amount of hemorrhage layering within the occipital
horns of the
lateral ventricles without appreciable change to the ventricular
appearence.

ATTENDING NOTE: Small amount of new posterior falx/tentorium SDH
described
above could just be due to redistribution and is likely not a
new finding.

[**10-18**] EGD:
Findings: Esophagus:
 Contents: Two coins were found in the lower third of the
esophagus, one nickel and one [**Female First Name (un) **]. There was associated food
mixed in as well.   The foreign body was successfully removed
using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] net
 Excavated Lesions A large nearly circumferential ulcer was
found in the lower third of the esophagus at the site of coin
impaction.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Diffuse erythema and petechiae of the mucosa were noted
in the whole stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Two coins in the lower third of the esophagus
(foreign body removal)
Ulcer in the lower third of the esophagus
Erythema and petechiae in the whole stomach c/w gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a 60yo M with PMH of EtOH abuse admitted with fever,
multifocal intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusions, course
complicated by aspiration pneumonia and SIADH

# Traumatic Head Injury with Intraparenchymal bleed and subdural
bleed - pt found s/p seizure per report, had mechanism
significant enough for occipital frx. Evaluated by Neurosurgery
with no indication for surgical intervention. Tox screen
negative. No evidence of lelevated ICP. Repeat CT Head showed
likely stable blood, redistribution, but no new acute bleed.
Dilantin was started in house; he had apparently been on
Depakote before, and Keppra was considered, however, cost makes
dilantin more appropriate. Currently on stable dose 250mg [**Hospital1 **]
with levels, corrected for albumin, in the therapeutic range
(target [**10-11**], recent corrected levels on this dose have been
[**12-5**]).

Will followup with neurosurgery/Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**10-28**] at which
time he will also have repeat CT of head (noncontrast) for
resolution.

# SIADH: likely [**1-24**] ICH, also consider drug effect from SSRI,
which was stopped. Stable on regimen of NaCl tabs (3gm tid with
meals) and lasix 20mg daily, which has kept serum sodium between
126 and 130 for over a week. Should have sodium checked at least
twice a week; we expect this to resolve as ICH resorbs and brain
parenchyma heals.

# Cervical spine injury: Pt w/ negative c-spine CT. MRI obtained
to eval for ligamentous injury but not useful due to motion
artifact.

# Aspiration pneumonia- Retrocardiac opacity on initial CXR was
thought most likely aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with
a full course of antibiotics. He continues to have silent
aspiration secondary to dysphagia; speech and swallow therapist
recommended thickened liquids and soft foods, 1:1 assistance
with meals, and aspiration precautions (sitting fully upright to
eat, chewing carefully, small bites alternating with sips).
However, patient has been intermittently noncompliant, drinking
tap water in his room despite our recommendations not to.

# Chronic Pleural Effusions s/p VATS and decortication - unclear
if CXR change from baseline.

# COPD - Reported history of chronic pleural effusions, s/p VATS
and decortication, as well, which may explain poor/rhonchorous
breath sounds on exam. Continued on spiriva and albuterol.

# Alcohol withdrawal seizures - Unclear seizure history - pt on
depakote as outpatient. Possible seizure focus related to bleed,
although report from OSH indicated pt had seizure event prior to
fall with head trauma. EtOH level negative on presentation,

# Atrial Fibrillation - holding ASA as above, will restart per
Neurosur
