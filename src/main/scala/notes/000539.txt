CXR [**4-2**]
Cardiomegaly is mild-to-moderate predominantly involving the
left ventricle.
The mediastinal position, contour and width are unremarkable.
There is
interval slight worsening of the right basilar opacity that has
been present
before but appears to be more obvious and might represent either
interval
aspiration or worsening of atelectasis. Left lower lobe opacity
is unchanged,
most likely representing either chronic scarring or area of
atelectasis.

CXR [**4-4**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-3**], the bilateral
areas of
opacification are decreasing. This could reflect clearing of
aspiration or
reduction in pulmonary venous congestion. Enlargement of the
cardiac
silhouette persists. Nasogastric tube again extends well into
the stomach

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to inferior and posterior
wall hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

RUQ U/S w/ doppler
IMPRESSION:

1. Hepatofugal flow in the main portal vein is new since
[**2159-12-12**]. There is
no evidence of venous thrombosis.

2. Evaluation of the hepatic parenchyma is markedly limited for
assessment of
known hepatic lesions, which are better demonstrated on CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis, likely HCC,
presented with profuse post-procedure bleeding after elective
tooth extraction, course complicated by NSTEMI and pulmonary
edema. Hospital course was as follows.

     On admission, patient was noted to have considerable
bleeding from her mouth. She was given vitamin K 10mg PO once
and admitted to the medicine [**Hospital1 **] for further management. She
was initially hemodynamically stable,. Her hematocrit dropped
from 37 to 22 in less than 24 hours, requiring transfer to MICU.
Prior to transfer, she received 2 units FFP given an INR of 2.9
(underlying liver disease). Dentistry was consulted and
recommended contacting oral surgery. Oral surgery could not be
reached in house through several attempts; the case was
discussed with oral surgery residents at [**Hospital1 2025**] who suggested
pressure and xerofrom dressing. [**4-2**] evening around 5pm, patient
developed sinus tachycardia to 130's, with low grade temp of
100.0. Patient was tremulous. HCT trend [**4-2**] 1:20 AM 37, 4:30 AM
33.8, 9AM 26.8, 4:30 PM 22.1. She got FFP as above, ordered for
2 units PRBC and cultured. She received clindamycin for
prophylaxis after tooth extraction. She was transferred to the
ICU for further management.
     In the MICU, she was transfused 4 units PRBCs, FFP, and
mouth was packed with aminocaproic-acid soaked gauze, with good
hemostasis. She ruled in for NSTEMI with trop peak 1.99; started
ASA and metoprolol. After transfusions, she had mild-mod volume
overload, and she was gently diuresed. She was transferred back
to the medicine service for further management.
     Remainder of hospital course was as follows.

1. NSTEMI: Peri-MI EF 35-40%, with mild-mod volume overload.
Troponin peaked at 1.99, as above. Patient was started on
aspirin 325mg daily. Plavix was not started given concern for
bleeding (mouth, esophageal varices). She was also started on a
low-dose cardioselective beta-blocker. She was evaluated by PT
and sent home with cardiac rehabilitation.

2. Alcoholic cirrhosis: RUQ ultrasound on [**2160-4-4**] showed reversal
of flow in portal vein, new since [**12-7**]. Concern for worsening
hepatic disease/cirrhosis vs. thrombosis. She was continued on
rifaxamin and beta-blocker, as above. She was also started on a
PPI. A CTA liver to further assess flow reversal was scheduled
as an outpatient.

3. Alcohol abuse: Actively using alcoho
