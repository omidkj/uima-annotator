Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

valve)/ Ascending aorta replacement/Saphenous vein
(SVG)interposition graft between RIMA.


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 9907**] is a 60-year-old lady who in [**2195**] underwent an
ascending aortic tube graft replacement for an ascending aortic
aneurysm/dissection that was found to be circulytic in origin.
That was done with a 24-mm Gelweave graft at the time. In [**2196**],
she subsequently developed a pseudoaneurysm of the proximal
suture line and was re-operated on and the pseudoaneurysm was
resected and the
anastomosis at that point was repaired. She has been
experiencing worsening shortness of breath and was found to have
severe aortic insufficiency with 4+ aortic insufficiency and a
dilating left ventricle. The initial surgery mentioned the AV
suspension of the aortic valve. She also had a right internal
mammary artery graft at the time and underwent operation to the
distal right coronary artery that was transected and revised at
the time of the second operation. The preoperative
catheterization and imaging showed that the
right internal mammary artery crosses the midline and was in a
very tenuous location.

Past Medical History:
hypothyroidism
hypercholesterolemia
GERD
TIA
HTN
OA of the spine

[**2202-9-22**] Carotid Ultrasound
Bilateral less than 40% ICA stenosis.

[**2202-9-22**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease, patent
previously-placed
stents, and a patent single-vessel bypass graft.  The LMCA had a
20%
distal stenosis.  The LAD had a 30% proximal stenosis and a
widely
patent stent.  The LCX had a 50% proximal stenosis and widely
patent
stents.  The RCA was not injected as it is known to be
chronically
occluded.  The RIMA-RPDA graft was without
angiographically-apparent
stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right- and
left-sided
filling pressures.  Right-heart pressures included RA of
[**1-14**]/9, RV of
40/4 with RVEDP of 14, PA of 40/15/27, and PCWP of 18/16/15.
3.  Supra-valvular aortography revealed severe aortic
regurgitation.
Aortic pressures were 142/42/81 and LV pressures were 142/8 with
an
LVEDP of 18.
4.  LV-gram demonstrated diffuse hypokinesis with an estimated
LVEF of
47%.

[**2202-9-23**] CTA CHest
1. Patient is status post ascending aorta repair. No evidence of
aortic
dissection or pseudoaneurysm. Minimum calcification in the
aortic arch,
unchanged compared to prior study in [**2199-10-3**].
2. Marked emphysematous changes in the upper lobes, which
appears unchanged
compared to prior study in [**2199-10-3**].
3. 13-mm right hilar lymph node in creased in size from prior
study. Follow-up CT in 6 months is recommended to ensure
stability of this finding.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 11445**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2202-9-22**] for further
work-up in preparation of her redo-redo cardiac surgery. A
cardiac catheterization was performed which showed single vessel
disease and severe aortic regurgitation. A CT scan was performed
to evaluated her aorta in preparation for her surgery. As she
complained of a hoarse voice, the ENT service was consulted. No
significant abnormalities were found on fiberoptic exam and the
recommendation was to dose her proton pump inhibitor at a double
dose to promote laryngeal recovery from presumed regurgitation.
Lastly, in preparation for surgery, a carotid duplex ultrasound
was obtained which showed less then 40% internal artery stenosis
bilaterally. On [**2202-9-24**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 9907**] was taken to the operating
room where she underwent a redo-redo stenotomy with replacement
of her aortic valve using a tissue prosthesis, an ascending
aorta replacement and a saphenous vein interposition graft for
the right internal mammary artery graft. Please see operative
not for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. Ciprofloxacin was started for
klebsiella which grew from urine culture. Diuresis was
initiated. She was slowly weaned form the ventilator and
extuubated on postoperative day three. Beta blockade was
initially held due to bradycardia. On postoperative day four,
she was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
She continued to be gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. She
complained of mild left upper extremity weakness however her
exam showed her strength to be [**6-7**] bilaterally. Her weakness
slowly resolved. Neurology consult was obtained for remaining
LUE fine motor deficit.  It was recommended that the patient
continue aspirin and plavix and follow up as an outpatient for
MRI.
By the time of discharge to home on POD6 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound wa
