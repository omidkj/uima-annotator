Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
MS changes, malignant hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 97475**] is a 72 yo F with ESRD on HD (MWF) [**2-20**]
hypertensive nephrosclerosis, as well as malignant HTN and
hyperparathyroidism, who presented with confusion and severe HTN
(240's/140's) on [**2140-3-7**] and was admitted for hypertensive
emergency and altered MS.  She also has had diarrhea and
abdominal pain with emesis x 1.  She was due to receive HD on
[**2140-3-7**] but missed her appt.  She was brought in by her son for
a change in mental status from baseline.  Of note, her PD
catheter was w/o a cap -- she was trialed on PD, but stopped
because it was too difficult.  She is currently on HD.
.
In the ED, initial V/S: T 96.4 HR 113 BP 187/116 RR 28 O2sat
96%RA.  She was given Diovan 320, Hydral 10, Vanco, Ceftriaxone,
and Kayexalate.  Her BP was up to 240's/140's and she was
started on a nitro gtt.  Pt was seen by renal in the ED.  She
underwent a head CT, which showed no acute pathology.  She was
empirically covered with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible
infection from PD cath; however, peritoneal fluid only had 35
WBC's.  A CT abdomen and pelvis was unremarkable except for some
cystic lesions in the tail of the pancreas for which the MICU
team is recommending MRI f/u non-urgently.  She required a nitro
gtt for BP control in the MICU.  The team felt her elevated
pressures were [**2-20**] medication non-compliance, bad underlying
disease, and underdialysis.  They have made adjustments to her
home PO regimen.  MS changes are likely due to underlying
cognitive decline vs. hypertensive encephalopathy vs. ?
infectious etiology.  She had one episode of Afib with RVR,
which responded to Diltiazem gtt, and is on a heparin gtt.  She
will have her PD catheter removed and an AV fistula placed as an
outpatient.
.
ROS:
The patient denies confusion, headache, changes in vision, chest
pain, SOB out of proportion to her usual SOB, abdominal pain,
nausea, diarrhea, weakness or edema.

Past Medical History:
1.  CKD stage V.
2.  Hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
3.  History of malignant hypertension.
4.  Osteoporosis seen in bone density [**2137**].
5.  No evidence of vascular calcification on recent MR imaging.
6.  Anemia of chronic disease.

alcohol, or illicit drug use.  Pt has 2 children, is widowed,
and formerly wored as an X-ray tech.

.
CXR: [**2140-3-7**] Right-sided dialysis catheter again seen with tip
in the right atrium. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear
stable.  Slight increase in interstitial markings seen,
consistent with mild pulmonary edema. Moderate bilateral pleural
effusions are identified.  No definite focal consolidations
identified.  Likely atelectasis seen at the bases. Levoscoliosis
of the thoracolumbar spine is identified.  Calcifications are
seen overlying the atherosclerotic calcifications noted within
the aorta. IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema with moderate
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Head ct: [**3-7**]
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage.  Confluent periventricular hypoattenuation is
consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  No loss
of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an acute
intravascular territorial infarct.  The ventricles are normal in
size and configuration.  There is diffuse increased density and
mild thickening of the calvarium, perhaps related to the
patient's chronic renal disease.  In
addition, there is a focal area of nonspecific lysis within the
left parietal calvarium (3:16).  The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2.  Chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
.
CT abd/pelvis: [**3-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute intra-abdominal pathology identified. Scattered
foci of free air throughout the abdomen, presumably related to
the patient's peritoneal dialysis catheter.
2.  Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis. Cardiomegaly.
3.  Enlarging and new cystic lesions in the distal body and tail
of the pancreas, for which further evaluation by MRI is
recommended. Innumerable renal cysts, which can also be
evaluated at the time of the MRI.
.
ECHO: IMPRESSION: Severe global LV hypokinesis. Moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic regurgitation,
moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension and probable pulmonary artery diastolic
hypertension. Severe left atrial enlargement. No prior echo for
comparison.
.
PMIBI: INTERPRETATION:
Left ventricular cavity size is at the upper limits of normal.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake
throughout the  left ventricular myocardium.
Gated images reveal severely globally hypokinetic.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 26%.
Compared with the normal study of [**2138-11-17**], there has been
marked decrease of the EF and worsening of the global wall
motion.
IMPRESSION:  1.  Normal myocardial perfusion.  2.  Severe LV
systolic
dysfunction (EF 26%) and global severe hypokinesis.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo F with PMH s/f ESRD and malignant HTN who was admitted
with hypertensive crisis with altered mental status.
.
# HTN: Pt presented with BP's to 240/140.  She is usually
hypertensive at baseline, however, this is elevated for her.
This is likely a combination of her baseline severe HTN combined
with her recent medication non-adherence (it appears that upon
her last hospital discharge pt was unable to manage her
medications at home on her own) and likely under-dialysis with
chronic fluid overload, esp. as pt had not missed dialysis and
tolerated high volume removal without becoming hypotensive.
Cardiology and renal were both consulted who worked to create a
better BP regimen. The patient was eventually controlled with
BPs in 130s, 140s on lisinopril 40 [**Hospital1 **], felodipine [**Hospital1 **] and
carvedilol.   Renal has been working with the pt to dialyze off
more fluid.  She will continue dialysis as an outpatient on her
MWF schedule.  She is to follow up with transplant surgery as an
outpatient per their recommendation for future removal of her
peritoneal dialysis catheter as well as evaluaton for placement
of
