Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status and respiratory distress

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88504**] is a 59 year old male with COPD, NSCLC and SCLC with
metastases to brain s/p chemotherapy and radiation admitted with
hypokalemia on [**2116-12-29**].  His hypokalemia was difficult to
replete with oral and IV potassium and eventually attributed to
inappropriate ACTH secretion from his tumor.  He was noted to be
alert and oriented yesterday with change in mental status to
confusion to year and somnolence along with increased work of
breathing this morning.  Vital signs: 89% RA with baseline low
90% on RA.  He was given 2LNC which improved his oxygenation to
96%RA.  ABG on room air showed alkalosis with 7.55/46/63.
P:120.  RR:22. Lactate of 2.5.  CXR showed no acute process on
my read though cannot completely rule out LLL process in setting
of AP CXR with cardiomegaly.
.
He triggered for tachypnea in the morning.  We evaluated him at
that time, and his lungs were clear, and had no signs of fluid
overload.  A CTA Chest was performed that did not show evidence
of PE, but did show evidence of PNA.  He was started on
vanc/cefepime for HAP.
.
The evening of [**2116-12-29**] he was found to be in respiratory
distress and hypoxic with O2 sat of 30%. He was profundly
somnolent.  He was placed on a NRB and O2 sat came up to 100%.
On exam he had extremely poor air movement, wheezing, and
extended expiratory phase. Hypertensive to 200/100/.  ABG
7.15/109/256/39.  He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory
failure and transferred to the MICU.  Given etomidate,
succinylcholine prior to intubation.

IMAGING:
[**2116-12-29**] CHEST X-RAY PA/LAT:
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Surgical clips
are noted along the left mediastinal border with extensive
scarring and upward hilar retraction. There is volume loss in
the left lung compatible with prior partial lung resection with
partial osteotomy in the left rib cage. There is right hilar
prominence and lymphadenopaty cannot be excluded. There is no
definite sign of pneumonia. Bony structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes in the left upper lung. No
evidence of
pneumonia. Right hilar prominence. Recommend correlation with
nonemergent CT.
.
[**2116-12-31**] CTA CHEST: TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images through the chest
were acquired before and after administration of intravenous
contrast. Coronal, sagittal, and bilateral oblique reformatted
images were reviewed.
FINDINGS: There is a new large left lower lobe consolidation and
small right upper lobe consolidation, concerning for pneumonia.
There is increased right upper lobe bronchial wall thickening,
also suggestive of infection. There is a new small right pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax is seen. The pulmonary arteries appear
patent to the subsegmental levels without evidence for pulmonary
embolus. Left upper lobe lobectomy changes are again seen with
left-sided volume loss. The heart and great vessels are grossly
within normal limits. No pericardial effusion is seen.
Subcarinal lymphadenopathy measuring 2 cm is stable (4:27). A
large right hilar lymph node measures 26 mm (4:27, previously 18
mm).
This study is not optimized for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic
structures.  Within this limitation, there appear to be
innumerable new hypodensities within the liver, concerning fo
