Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypertension - unclear why BP was so high. Pt denied med
noncompliance. Creatinine was stable. Possibilities include
benzodiazepine withdrawal as pt reports that she was recently
taken off of alprazolam, however was given diazepam within the
last week. Shortly after admission to the ICU, her blood
pressures improved to the 110s/80s; however after restarting her
first dose of clonidine and an increased dose of HCTZ 25, her
blood pressures decreased to 80s/40s. Her blood pressure
improved with IVF and she was then continued on
hydrochlorothiazide 25 alone.

On floor, she was hypertensive to 190SBP. Hence
