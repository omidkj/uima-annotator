HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old female
with diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic
renal insufficiency, who was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit for treatment of hyperglycemia.  Over the past few days
prior to admission, the patient's fingersticks were in the
400s.  In addition, she had four days of increasing shortness
of breath.  She awoke on the morning of admission with severe
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  In addition,
she had an episode of chest pain associated with diaphoresis
and shortness of breath that occurred for a short period of
time and then resolved on its own.  She states that she takes
her insulin as prescribed and with feedings of normal meals.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus for twenty-six years with history of
diabetic ketoacidosis admissions.
2.  History of gastroparesis.
3.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2103**], status post cardiac catheterization in
[**2109**].  Persantine MIBI in [**2109-6-27**], showed a fixed basal
lateral wall defect.
4.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
40%, mild global hypokinesis, and basal lateral hypokinesis.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced.  She denies alcohol
use.  She has two children.  She has positive tobacco
history.  She smoked approximately two packs per day for
about fifty years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Not obtained.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 218/63 which changed
to 138/43 with 5 mg of intravenous Lopressor and Hydralazine.
Temperature 95.8, pulse 62, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 100% on two liters.  Examination significant for
elderly female in no acute distress with moist mucous
membranes.   Heart - normal S1 and S2, with S4.  Pulmonary -
decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases.  Abdomen - mild
tenderness in right upper quadrant.  Extremities -  1+
peripheral edema.  All other organ systems examined and found
to be within normal limits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 7.1, hematocrit
30.2.  Sodium 136, potassium 5.0, blood urea nitrogen 48,
creatinine 2.3, anion gap of 12, glucose 696.  Initial
arterial blood gases showed pH 7.35, 46, 127.  Alkaline
phosphatase 122, albumin 3.1, CPK 76, troponin 0.09.
Urinalysis with 500 protein, 1000 glucose, 15 ketone.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per
minute, normal axis, left atrial enlargement.  T wave
inversions inferolaterally.

Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure, bilateral small
pleural effusions and emphysema.  Abdominal ultrasound showed
no duct dilatations, no free fluid, no liver abnormality, 2.2
by 2.5 centimeter cyst in the right kidney.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 61 year old female, active
tobacco user, who came to the Emergency Department with
gastrointestinal symptoms and was found to have a serum
glucose of 696, acute renal failure on top of chronic renal
insufficiency, and hypertension.

1.  Hyperglycemia - The patient was initially given an
insulin bolus and started on insulin drip.  She never had an
anion gap.  Her insulin drip was transitioned over to
subcutaneous insulin.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and the patient
was maintained on Glargine and Humalog insulin sliding scale.

2.  Diastolic congestive heart failure - The patient was
hydrated on admission to treat her hyperglycemia.  After this
hydration, she complained of orthopnea but her oxygen
saturation measurements remained unchanged.  She appeared
slightly fluid overloaded.  However, because of her increased
creatinine function, she was not actively diuresed.  She was
maintained on 1.5 liter fluid restriction after input and
output.  Her ace inhibitor was also held because of her renal
function.

3.  Acute on chronic renal failure - Initially the patient's
creatinine was 2.3 on admission and her baseline creatinine
is 1.3 to 1.6.  She was initially treated with intravenous
fluids.  The thought was that her baseline renal function has
been deteriorating recently.  Prior to discharge, her 24 hour
urine was collected for use with her outpatient management.
The total protein was 362, sodium 47 and creatinine 58 which
gives a ratio of about 6:1 protein to creatinine.  She did
not have urine eosinophils.  Renal ultrasound revealed no
hydronephrosis.  There was a tiny nonobstructing stones
bilaterally.  Mild increase in echogenicity of the renal
parenchyma consistent with medical renal disease.  Her
creatinine peaked at 3.1.

4.  Hypertension - Initially, her blood pressure was elevated
in the Emergency Department and she was treated with
intravenous beta blocker and Hydralazine.  During her
hospitalization, her ace inhibitor was held and she was
maintained on beta blocker, Hydralazine, and long acting
nitrates for blood pressure control.  Upon discharge, she
will continue this regimen and follow-up as an outpatient for
reinstituting her ace inhibitor and for managing her blood
pressure medications.

5.  Coronary artery disease - She will continue on her beta
blocker, Aspirin and statin.

6.  Precautions - The patient was kept on Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus precautions because she had a
recent Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary
tract infection.

7.  Abdominal pain - On admission, the patient complained of
abdominal pain and right upper quadrant ultrasound did not
reveal any gallbladder or liver abnormality.  She had a
mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase and elevated GGT.  These
abnormalities had unclear etiology.  Upon discharge, she no
longer was having abdominal pain.  She will be monitored as
an outpatient.

8.  History of pleural effusions - Apparently during her last
hospitalization, the patient had pleural effusions that
required thoracentesis.  They revealed a transudate with
negative cytology.  She had mediastinal lymphadenopathy on
chest x-ray.  She will need outpatient follow-up to evaluate
for possible cancer.

9.  Infectious disease - The patient had two sets of negative
blood cultures drawn on admission and, in addition, she had
stool cultures sent that were negative for salmonella,
shigella, Campylobacter, Vibrio, Yersinia, E. coli,
Clostridium difficile upon admission because of her abdominal
pain.  A urine culture drawn upon admission had no growth.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home with
services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Tolerating p.o. diet, ambulating
with assistance, creatinine 3.1, blood urea nitrogen 67,
protein/creatinine ratio on 24 hour urine of 6.2.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hyperglycemia.
2.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Congestive heart failure.
5.  Acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
9.  History of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus
urinary tract infection.
