Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 40 yo man (unknown if L or R handed), with
paraplegia following MVA, asthma, GERD, substance abuse, ?
seizure disorder, decubitus ulcers, s/p osteomyelitis who was
brought to ED by EMS.

Per EMS records, the family called EMS for confusion at home. He

apparently had been taken off benzo's and narcotics recently
(not
known when and what he had been taking). He was found to have
shaking in his upper body, but was able to respond to voice. On
the way in he was given ativan 5mg im.

Upon arrival in the ED (23.06), he still had rhythmical
movements
in his upper body and respiratory muscles. He was able to mumble

to voice but could not follow any commands. Shorlty after
arrival, the seizure activity appeared to stop, but then it
resumed. He was given 6mg ativan iv and 5mg valium iv and was
loaded on Dilantin 1.5g iv. Around 23.45, after the dilantin was

loaded, the seizure broke.

CXR:
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar opacities likely due to lower lobe
collapse or possibly pneumonia secondary to aspiration.

CT head [**3-21**]:
Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: High-attenuation material is identified layering
within several right parietal sulci concerning for subarachnoid
hemorrhage. There is no evidence of mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures or hydrocephalus. A 2.1 x 2.0cm
low-attenuation focus in the right posterior parietal lobe with
a slightly higher attenuation center, concerning for possible
mass with surrounding edema. Additional ill- defined areas of
low attenuation are seen in the white matter tracts of the
bilateral occipital lobes and may represent vasogenic edema. No
other definite parenchymal abnormality is identified. The
surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated.

IMPRESSION:

1. High-density material layering within several right parietal
lobe sulci consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

2. A 2-cm focal area of hypoattenuation within the right
superior parietal lobe with central area of low attenuation
concerning for possible underlying mass lesion with surrounding
edema; alternatively, this may simply represent edema
surrounging [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter.

3. Hypoattenuation within the white matter tracts of the
bilateral occipital lobes, which may reflect vasogenic edema.

These findings are concerning for underlying lesion and followup
with MR or contrast-enhanced CT is recommended when the patient
is more stable.

These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28438**] at 1:00 a.m. on
[**2143-3-21**].

EEG following AM:
BACKGROUND: Showed an alpha frequency at times but was most
often a
lower voltage fast record.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: The patient appeared to remain awake or mildly drowsy
throughout
the recording. No stage II sleep was obtained.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed an irregular rhythm at times. There were
long
periods of a normal sinus rhythm, but there were other periods
with far
less regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: Normal EEG in the waking and drowsy states. The
faster
background rhythms raise the possibility of medication effect.
There
were no areas of focal slowing, and there were no epileptiform
features.
An abnormal cardiac rhythm was noted, but this would be assessed
better
through routine ECG tracings.

Cervical spine.
HISTORY: Pre MRI, neck hardware.
A single AP view of cervical spine shows cerclage wires likely
about the spinous processes of lower cervical vertebrae. There
is no lateral view for assessment of the location of these
wires.

MRI BRAIN AND MRV AND MRA OF THE HEAD
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage and
possible mass on CT, for further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
axial images of the brain were obtained. 3D time-of-flight MRA
of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was acquired. 2D time-of-flight MRV of
