EGD:
Medium hiatal hernia
Granularity, friability, erythema and nodularity in the lower
third of the esophagus compatible with erosive esophagitis
(biopsy)
Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Colonoscopy:
A single sessile 20 mm non-bleeding polyp was found in the
ascending colon. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology. A single sessile 3 mm non-bleeding polyp of benign
appearance was found in the ascending colon.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o female with HTN, DM, CHF with EF 25-30%, mesenteric vein
thrombosis (on coumadin), Ulcerative colitis and recent C. diff
colitis presenting with melanotic stools, coffee ground emesis
in setting of coagulopathy with INR 4.5 on admission.

#1 GI bleed: Pt hemodynamically stable with HCT of 24.2 on
admission after 1 unit RBC at outside hospital. Received FFP in
[**Hospital 18**] hospital with reversal INR to 1.8 and placed on IV
pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].  Initially the patient was observed in the
ICU.  A central line was placed for access and blood draws due
to poor peripheral access.  Serial hematocrits were followed and
showed no evidence of active bleeding.  An EGD performed on [**9-3**]
showed increased granularity, friability, erythema and
congestion in the lower third of the esophagus from 25cm to 35cm
but no evidence active bleeding.  The patient was transferred to
the regular medical floor where she was observed for any further
bleeding.  Colonoscopy performed on [**9-7**] revealed a single
sessile 20 mm non-bleeding polyp in the ascending colon which
was biopsied.  Polypectomy was deferred to outpatient setting
secondary to recent active GI bleed.  A repeat EGD was also
performed for biopsy of erosive gastritis.  The patient was
discharged on pantoprazole twice daily with instructions to
follow up with Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) **] for polypectomy.

#2 Anticoagulation for history of mesenteric vein thrombosis in
[**2146**]: Patient presented with acute GI bleed in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR.  As outlined above, the patient's
anticoagulation was reversed using FFP and vitamin K and
coumadin was held for the duration of her hospitalization.  Upon
discharge the patient was not restarted on her coumadin as her
colonic polyp was felt to be a significant risk for chronic
gastrointestinal bleed.  The decision whether to continue
longterm anticoagulation is deferred to the patient's primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17863**].  Patients' with IBD are at 3x higher
risk for developping pulmonary embolism/ deep venous thrombosis
compared to the normal population.  Most associated
thromboembolic events occur within the portal, mesenteric and
retinal veins.  80% of patient's who present with newly
diagnosed thromboses have active IBD at the time of diagnosis.

#3 Heart Failure: Systolic (EF55%):  The patient presented with
mild symptoms of volume overload consistent with CHF
exaccerbation post transfusion.  During her hospitalization,
volume status was monitored clinically and she was diuresed as
needed with lasix.  Upon discharge, patient was euvolemic with
no crackles in her lungs and only mild edema in extremities.
She was discharged on her home dose of lasix.

#4 HTN: In the setting of an acute bleed, the patient's home
blood pressure medications were held.  Subsequently, the patient
was hypertensive with systolic blood pressure in the 170s.  She
remained asymptomatic with no symptoms of end organ ischemia.
Once hemodynamic stability was confirmed, home antihypertensive
regimen (lisinopril, norvasc, metoprolol, lasix) was resumed and
the patient remained normotensive.

#5 Ulcerative Colitis: Patient has history of ulcerative
colitis.  She was maintained on her home dose of azathioprine
and asacol and had no evidence of active disease as confirmed by
colonoscopy report.

#6 clostridium difficile: Prior to admission, the patient had
been started on flagyl on [**8-31**] for clostridium difficile.  This
regimen was continued and patient was discharged with
instructions to complete the entire 14 day course.  As per
colonoscopy report, the patient did not have severe disease and
no psuedomembranous colitis or evidence of toxic megacolone was
visible.

#7 DM: Patient's home dose of glimeprimide was held throughout
hospital course.  Despite instituting sliding scale insulin, the
patient was hyperglycemic with average glucose ranging 200-220
throughout her hospital stay.  Upon discharge, home medical
management was reinstituted.

#8 Dementia: At mental baseline, the patient was alert and
oriented to person only.  This was stable throughout her
hospital stay.  Patient was maintained on her rivastigmine and
antidepressive.

#9 Reflux disease: On omeprazole at home.  Started on
pantopraz
