Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 88-year-old woman was
admitted after a pericardial drain placement for pericardial
tamponade.  She has a past medical history significant for
hypertension and stroke.  She developed dyspnea and weakness
at home approximately one week ago.  She presented to [**Hospital3 21232**] where she was found to be in atrial fibrillation.
She was rate controlled, anticoagulated, and sent home on
[**2151-10-28**].

Today, she had persistent shortness of breath and weakness at
home and returned to [**Hospital3 **], where a transthoracic
echocardiogram revealed a large pericardial effusion with
right ventricular collapse.  She was subsequently transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On arrival, she had a blood pressure of 130/70, heart rate in
the 80s, in atrial fibrillation, and a pulses paradoxus of
20-25 mmHg.  She was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory
where a pericardial drain was placed and 450 cc of
serosanguinous fluid were drained.  A subsequent bedside TTE
showed minimal residual effusion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple TIAs, stroke.
2.  Osteoporosis.
3.  Status post ovarian cyst removal.
4.  Status post right total knee replacement.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
2.  Plavix.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
4.  Tums.
5.  Potassium.
6.  Multivitamin.
7.  Started Diltiazem and Coumadin last week.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone in [**Location (un) 2498**].  She
quit smoking about 30 years ago after 30 pack years.  She
drinks alcohol occasionally.  Her PCP is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] in
[**Location (un) 13360**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.0, heart rate 88, blood pressure 126/63, oxygen saturation
97% on 4 liters, normal JVP, 2+ carotid pulses, no carotid
bruits.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Heart:
Regular rate, irregularly/irregular rhythm with a friction
rub and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the lower sternal
border.  Abdomen:  Benign.  Extremities:  With 1+ distal
pulses, right groin site soft without hematoma or bruit.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Significant for a white blood
count 10.2, hematocrit 31.9, platelets 255,000.  INR 1.3,
APTT 26.4.  Sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride 91, total C02
28, BUN 26, creatinine 0.9, glucose 158, CK 28, lipase 13.

EKG revealed an atrial fibrillation at 96 beats per minute,
normal axis, QTC 457, low voltage diffusely, with poor R wave
progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU and
closely monitored after her pericardial drain placement.  On
[**2151-11-1**], the patient was noted to have tachypnea
with a respiration rate in the low 30s and a pulsus paradoxus
of 16.  A repeat echocardiogram was performed showing some
reaccumulation of pericardial fluid as compared with a TTE
done about 18 hours earlier.  The output of the drain
remained minimal and a repeat echocardiogram done later in
the day revealed interval decrease in the size of the
pericardial effusion.  The pericardial drain was subsequently
discontinued without complications.

The patient received a CT angiogram for persistent tachypnea
which revealed bilateral pleural effusions but no evidence of
pulmonary embolism.  As the patient had a continued
persistent oxygen requirement of 5 liters nasal cannula, a
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to assess for evidence of heart
failure as a cause of hypoxemia.  The PCWP was 15 to 16, and
the patient was diuresed with a total of 120 mg of
intravenous furosemide.  Her fluid balance was net 2 liters
negative on [**2151-11-2**].

On [**2151-11-3**], the patient had continued dyspnea
despite the substantial diuresis.  She had persistent wheezes
on physical examination.  The differential diagnosis for
these findings was felt to include a COPD flare and the
patient was given 60 mg of methylprednisolone IV as well as a
dose of levofloxacin.  She was subsequently placed on
prednisone 60 mg q.d. and Salmeterol.

After these interventions, the patient's breathing felt
subjectively improved and her oxygen requirement decreased to
the point where she had an oxygen saturation above 95% on
room air.

The patient remained in atrial fibrillation throughout her
admission.  She was continued on Diltiazem, which was
titrated to a dose of 90 mg q.i.d. for improved rate control.
This was converted to extended-release Diltiazem, and the
patient was discharged on a dose of 240 mg q.d.

Of note, the pericardial fluid returned with an increased
number of polyclonal lymphocytes.  Viral pericarditis was
felt to be the most likely etiology of the patient's
pericardial effusion.  The patient was restarted on Warfarin
anticoagulation for her atrial fibrillation on [**2151-11-4**].  She was placed on a prednisone taper for her COPD
flare.  A final echocardiogram done on [**2151-11-3**]
revealed a loculated appearing small to moderate size
pericardial effusion without any echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Prior to discharge, the patient had the onset of watery
stools in the setting of receiving levofloxacin for her COPD
exacerbation. Clostridium difficile toxin was checked and
returned negative.  The levofloxacin was discontinued.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pericardial tamponade, status post pericardiocentesis and
pericardial drain placement.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
4.  Osteoporosis.

DISCHARGE CONDITION: Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diltiazem Sustained-Release 240 mg q.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
3.  Prednisone 40 mg for one day, 20 mg for three days, 10 mg
for two days, 5 mg for two days.
4.  Fluticasone.
5.  Salmeterol.
6.  Albuterol.
7.  Atrovent.
8.  Warfarin 5 mg q.h.s.
