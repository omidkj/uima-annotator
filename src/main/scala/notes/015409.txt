Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim Ds

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Flash Pulmonary Edema, Hypotension, NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line


History of Present Illness:
81F hx of anterior STEMI in [**9-3**] s/p thrombectomy and BMS x 2 to
proximal LAD, EF 55% to 60% ([**1-5**]), also with distant hx of
Non-Hodkins Lymphoma and is currently undergoing her third cycle
of Gemzar/Cisplatin for Bladder CA (most recent treatment [**8-15**])
that presented to the ED this evening with SOB and later
hypotension.
.
Of note the pt was admitted on [**2147-9-19**] for palpitations where
she was noted to have SVT (likely AVNRT) on telemetry. During
the admission the pt had nausea, without any CP or SOB. ECG at
that time revealed new ST elevations anteriorly and the pt was
subsequently taken emegently to the cath lab.
.
Last night the pt awoke in with nausea. The pt took Compazine
and later Zofran without effect. The pt was given Decadron 10mg
iv, given NS 300 cc, and 2 units of PRBCs. The pt also took
Benadryl 25mg PO as well as Excedrin 500mg x2. The pt went to
sleep from 6pm to 9pm this evening when she awoke acutely SOB
and thus was brought to the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, initial vitals BP 100/58, HR 101,
afebrile, 98% on 100% nrb, RR 22.  Pt noted to have elevated JVP
and diffuse rales on exam.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: (summary per note of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
Her oncologic history begins in approximately [**2147-8-28**], at
which time she presented with hematuria. She had a prior workup
for hematuria in [**2143**], which was reportedly negative. She
underwent cystoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], which revealed diffuse
disease of the bladder. Biopsy performed on [**2147-9-4**] revealed
high-grade urothelial carcinoma infiltrating the lamina propria
present in the left lateral and right lateral walls. There was
low grade papillary urothelial carcinoma without lamina propria
invasion seen in the trigone. Her course was then complicated by
a STEMI approximately 2 weeks following the diagnosis of bladder
cancer. She received bare metal stents to the LAD.
She then underwent TURBT on [**2147-11-17**]. This was followed by BCG
x6 between [**2147-11-27**] and [**2148-1-11**]. Staging CT torso
performed on [**2148-1-11**] revealed no evidence of visceral
disease. She then went for repeat cystoscopy with TURBT on
[**2148-2-20**], with biopsy showing a focus suspicious for
muscularis propria invasion identified in the deep biopsy of the
tumor bed. There was also a rare focus suspicious for
lymphovascular invasion. Tumor at present on the left lateral
wall did show high-grade urothelial carcinoma invasive into the
muscularis propria. She met with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] this time for
consideration of a bladder resection, however, given the
complications of her recent heart attack, she was felt to be a
nonoperative candidate.
She was then considered for a trial through RTOG using combined
radiation with concurrent chemotherapy with taxane and possibly
with Herceptin, pending HER2/neu staining. However, she has had
progressive right greater than left knee pain over the last 3 to
6 months, which prompted a visit to the rheumatologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1667**], on [**2148-4-9**]. Plain films of the knees were obtained on
[**2148-4-16**] revealing multiple sclerotic foci involving bilateral
femur and proximal tibia, highly concerning for metastasis. She
then underwent MR of the right knee on [**2148-4-17**], which
revealed markedly abnormal marrow signal in the distal femur and
tibia, with areas of pathologic fracture along the medial
epicondyle and medial condyle associated with soft tissue
extension given this appearance is highly concerning for
extensive metastases with pathologic fractures. She then met
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**] of orthopedics, who proceeded with a
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 500**] biopsy on [**2146-5-2**], pathology consistent with metastatic
carcinoma, consistent with urothelial origin. The pt succesfully
underwent XRT which provided pain relief and began her first
dose of gemzar/cisplatin on [**6-18**].
