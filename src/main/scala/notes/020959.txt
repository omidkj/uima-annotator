CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with acute
onset right upper quadrant pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old female
with a history of gallstone pancreatitis, coronary artery
disease, peripheral vascular disease status post subclavian
stent, who presented with a one-day history of acute onset right
upper quadrant and epigastric pain.

She also complained of nausea and dry heaves.  She also
complained of fever and positive rigors.  She denied shortness of
breath, chest pain, constipation, diarrhea, bright red blood per
rectum, melena, and dysuria.
The patient initially presented to the [**Hospital1 1474**] Emergency
Department.  Her laboratory data at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital revealed
increased LFTs, increased amylase and lipase, and increased white
blood cell count of 16,000.  In addition, her temperature at
[**Hospital 21145**] Hospital was 101.2??????.  She was given Tequin 400 mg IV,
Flagyl 500 mg IV, and Lasix 40 mg IV, Morphine Sulfate 2 mg IV,
and Tylenol 650 p.r.  Blood cultures were drawn.  She was then
transferred here at [**Hospital6 256**] for an
ERCP.

In the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Department, her blood pressure was
noted to be 86/78, and she was given 2 L of fluid, and blood
pressure subsequently increased to 140/55.  Her temperature at
the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room was 101.9??????, pulse 79, and she had
an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air.  She complained of pain
and was given 2 mg Morphine Sulfate times two.

1.3, glucose 222, calcium 9.7; white count 16.1, hematocrit
38.3, platelet count 254; PT 13, PTT 22, INR 1.1; total
protein 7.3, albumin 4.6, ALT 350, AST 340, alkaline
phosphatase 247, total bilirubin 2.8, delta bilirubin 1.4,
amylase 132, lipase 829; CK 84, MB 1.7, troponin less than
0.3; urinalysis 30 mg protein, positive bilirubin, few

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital was negative by
report.  KUB at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital was negative by report.

Electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 82, [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in I, II, AVL, V4-6, pseudonormalization of
T-waves in I, II, AVL, V2-6.  This electrocardiogram was
compared to [**2191-7-16**].

Ultrasound at [**Hospital6 256**] showed
positive gallstones, no ductal dilatation, pancreas not
visualized.

ASSESSMENT:  This was a 75-year-old female with a history of
gallstone pancreatitis, history of coronary artery disease status
post non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, history of peripheral
vascular disease, who presented with right upper quadrant pain.

Based on clinical exam, laboratory data, and radiologic findings,
with her right upper quadrant tenderness, increased LFTs,
increased amylase and lipase, and elevated white blood cell
count, with fevers and with chills, her presentation was
consistent with cholangitis and pancreatitis secondary to
gallstones.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal/cholangeitis and
pancreatitis presumed secondary to gallstones:  The patient was
made NPO, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started for
coverage.  Antibiotics were Levaquin and Flagyl IV.  The patient
had an ERCP done which showed, 1) pus discharge from the major
papilla, 2) biliary dilatation, 3) cystic duct did not fill with
contrast, 4) amorphous material seen in the bile duct consistent
with sludge, 5) no filling defects to suggest stone present in
the bile duct, 6) successful sphincterotomy, and 7) successful
sludge extraction.

The Gastrointestinal recommendations were that the patient be
kept NPO, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  In addition, because the cystic duct
was unable to fill with contrast, there was concern over the fact
that a stone may be located in the cystic duct.  General Surgery
consult was placed for evaluation for cholecystectomy.

General Surgery evaluated the patient and felt that with numerous
gallstones, with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain, fever,
increased bilirubin/LFTs, that she had gallstone pancreatitis,
cholangitis, and occluded cystic duct.  The Surgery Team was
concerned about elevated troponin of 10.1.   Surgery was very
hesitant to operate on this patient.  They felt that she was
not an operative candidate in this setting and recommended
insertion of cholecystostomy tube.

Interventional Radiology/General Radiology was then consulted
for percutaneous drainage with a cholecystostomy tube.  The
patient was transferred to the SICU to have the percutaneous
drains placed in that setting.  The patient was then transferred
to the SICU, and a percutaneous cystostomy tube was placed
without event.  The patient was then transferred back to the
floor the following day.

Regarding the patient's bile fluid, the bile fluid culture grew
out enterococcus which is resistant to Vancomycin, penicillin,
Levofloxacin, and Ampicillin.  Regarding the patient's laboratory
data, after the percutaneous drainage, the patient's liver
enzymes, as well as pancreatic enzymes had been trending
downward, and on the day of discharge, the ALT is 103, AST
23, alkaline phosphatase 222, amylase 13, total bilirubin
1.1, and lipase 23.

Regarding the length of duration of the patient's biliary drain,
General Surgery recommended that the percutaneous drain stay in
place until cholecystectomy is performed. Because there was a
likelihood that the cystic duct is occluded with a stone, if the
drain is pulled prematurely, then there would be increased
pressure within the gallbladder, and the same situation/scenario
would occur again.  Thus, it was decided that the percutaneous
drains will remain in place until a cholecystectomy is performed,
which will be planned for approximately six months in the
future.

General Surgery typically does not operate on patients who have
had any type of coronary/cardiac event until six months post
event.  Given the patient's elevated troponin of 10.1, they will
plan for cholecystectomy in approximately six months; however,
prior to operation, the patient does need full cardiac work-up
including a stress MIBI to identify any reversible wall motion
defects and possible coronary catheterization after the stress
MIBI to potentially stent/repair any culprit lesions. This plan
has been discussed with the patient, as well as with the
patient's primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] are both am
