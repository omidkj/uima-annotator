PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:

Hct: 25.9 ([**9-26**]) -> 28.2 -> 25.8 ([**9-27**])

Cardiac cath, [**2147-12-19**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

revealed minimal CAD.  The LMCA had minimal distal disease.  The
LAD was patent with mild luminal irregularities.  The LCX and
ramus were patent.  The RCA had very mild ostial disease.
2.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal left and right
sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 11 mmHg and an RVEDP of 6
mmHg.
There was systemic arterial hypertension, with a central aortic
pressure of 151/61 mmHg.  Cardiac index was perserved at 2.6
l/min/m2.  There was no gradient on pull back across the aortic
valve.  There was no mitral stenosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 76 year-old female with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, PVD, s/p PTCA with stents to lower extremities
and carotid artery stenosis who presents for right carotid
artery stenting.
.
# CAD/PVD/ischemia - Patient was admitted for stenting of her
right internal carotid artery.  Patient did not have any
complications from the procedure.  Patient required
neosynepherine overnight.  She had one episode of numbess and
tingling in both hands on the morning of the 29th, which was
concurrent with a drop in SBP to the 60's.  Patient was upright
during this episode and her symptoms quickly resolved with lying
supine.  Patient was continued on her Plavix 75 mg daily,
Lipitor, and aspirin 81 mg daily.  Patient was ambulating on the
floor prior to discharge and was asymptomatic.
.
# Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit dropped during this hospital
stay to 24.6 on [**9-26**].  She was transfused one unit of blood, and
her hematocrit increased appropriately to 28.  Patient's
hematocrit again dropped to 25.9 prior to discharge.  The
patient was asymptomatic and was ambulating in the CCU.  Patient
