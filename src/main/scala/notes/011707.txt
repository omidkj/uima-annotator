Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted to the medical service on the evening before
his scheduled surgery for preoperative workup. He then was taken
to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7111**] for left total knee
arthroplasty on [**2116-12-7**]. See operative report for details. He
became slightly hypotensive after the induction of anesthesia,
requiring dopamine throughout the case. He tolerated the
procedure well, was extubated in the OR, and was transferred to
the ICU for postoperative monitoring. He was weaned off the
dopamine that evening. He was started on Coumadin for DVT
prophylaxis as well as for his history of atrial fibrillation.
He was started on CPM for range of motion and was seen by
physical therapy. He remained stable and on [**12-9**] he was
transferred to the surgical floor under the orthopaedic service.
He had an episode of atrial fibrillation which resolved with an
increased dose of carvedilol. He was followed by his
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] throughout his admission.  On [**12-13**] he
was stable for discharge to rehabilitation. He will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7111**] as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
