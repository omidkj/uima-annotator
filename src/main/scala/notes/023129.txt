Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
lisinopril / Levofloxacin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stents to the Right
coronary artery and left circumflex artery.


History of Present Illness:
87yo woman w/ a PMHx of CAD (noted on cath [**2151**]), Afib on
dabigatran, and valvular HD presented to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with 2 days
of intermittent midline chest discomfort as well as bilateral
jaw discomfort, increasing weakness, and nausea w/ no vomiting.
She has been taking nitroglycerin with intermittent relief of
this pain but has resisted until today coming to the hospital
until her daughter urged her. In the ED, EKG was notable for
A-Fib @87bpm and ST elev in 3, aVF, V5-V6. Troponin was elevated
to 1.65. Heparin and clopidogrel were held in setting of
dabigatran and hx of UGI bleeds. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cath.Initial ED vitals: 99.2 F P:96. RR: 26 BP:113/80. O2 sat:
100%.

In cath lab, pt was found to have blockage of OM and RCA. OM was
stented but pt's symptoms failed to improve. Pt subsequently
received RCA with resolution of symptoms. Case was otherwise
uncomplicated and pt is asymptomatic on transfer to CCU.

Cath: [**2163-7-30**]
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
free of angiographically apparant coronary artery disease.  The
LAD had a 60% lesion in its mid segment, and an 80% lesion in
the D1.  The LCx had a hazy 95% lesion at a bifurcation of the
OM1 with extension back into the proximal LCx.  The proximal RCA
had a diffuse, 80-90% lesion with a aneurysmal vs. ulcerated
segment.  The mid RCA had a 50% lesion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial blood pressure with a central aortic blood pressure of
132/73 mmHg.  The LVEDP was moderately elevated at 23 mmHg
consistent with moderate diastolic heart failure.  There was no
gradient across the aortic valve with pullback.
3. Successful PCI of LCX bifurcation disease with Integrity RX
2.5 x 18 mm BMS to lower pole of OM branch back into main LCX
vessel. Upper pole of OM branch was pre-dilated. Excellent
result.
4. Ongoing discomfort during procedure, so decided to proceed to
intervention on proximal RCA lesion. Successful PCI with
Integrity RX 3.0 x 26 mm bare metal stent with excellent result.

5. Successful hemostasis at right femoral arterial access site
using 6 Fr Exoseal vascular closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal systemic arterial blood pressure.
3. Moderately elevated LVEDP consistent with moderate diastolic
heart failure.
4. Inferolateral STEMI with successful PCI using BMI of LCX/OM
and proximal RCA.
5. Aspirin 81 mgs daily indefinitely, Clopidogrel 75 mgs for
minimum 6 weeks.

TTE: [**2163-8-1**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is markedly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Dilated thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
87yo female w/ a hx of CAD, Afib, valvular heart disease (MR+TR)
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] complaining of CP radiating to
jaw for 3 days. On work up found to have ST elevation
inferiorlateral MI transfered urgently to cath lab at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
#STEMI: EKG at [**Hospital1 **] notable for ST elevations in AvF, III, and
v5, v6 and had (+)trop which was concerning for LCx teritory
STEMI. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cath.  In the
cath lab, patient was found to have blockage of OM and RCA.
Patient had successful PCI of LCX bifurcation disease with
Integrity RX 2.5 x 18
mm BMS to lower pole of OM branch back into main LCX vessel.
Subsequently patient continued to have ongoing discomfort during
procedure, so decision was amde to proceed to intervention on
proximal RCA lesion with successful PCI with Integrity RX 3.0 x
26 mm bare metal stent with excellent result. Patient was
transfered to CCU for monitoring wh
