Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neurological Surgery Service for
resection of a left frontal meningioma. The patient was taken to
the OR and underwent an uncomplicated left frontal craniotomy w/
intraoperative image guidance, microscopic dissection and
duraplasty. The patient tolerated the procedure without
complications and was transferred to the ICU in stable condition
for frequent neuro monitoring. Please see operative report for
details. Post operatively pain was controlled with a PCA with a
transition to PO pain meds once tolerating POs.  The patient
tolerated diet advancement without difficulty and made steady
progress with diet and pain control. The patient was transferred
to the floor as less frequent monitoring was needed.

The patient received peri-operative antibiotics as well as
Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.  The incision was clean, dry,
and intact without evidence of erythema or drainage; and the
extremities were NVI throughout.  The patient was discharged in
stable condition with written instructions concerning
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care.
The patient will be continued on chemical seizure prophylaxis
for post-operatively.  All questions were answered prior to
discharge and the patient expressed readiness for discharge.
