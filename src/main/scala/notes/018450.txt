Brief Hospital Course:
overall, this is a 70 year old Cambodian speaking woman with
multiple neurological issues (suprasellar meningioma s/p
resection and vp shunt placement, multiple CVA's, h/o complex
seizure disorder, chronic HA s/p spinal stimulator placement)
and multiple endocrine abnormalities including but not limited
to: panhypopit thought to be [**3-11**] to her meningioma and related
surgery, DMII, hypothyroidism, once treated for central DI with
ddAVP, which then led to hyponatremia, and the drug was
subsequently d/c-ed--this probably also led to the impression
that she has SIADH, which has never been worked up and
diagnosed. She presented with 3-4 days of increased somnelence
and poor PO intake. Her Na was found to be 124 two days prior to
admission, and because of her ? diagnosis of SIADH, she was
further fluid restricted to 500cc fluids per day. Of note, she
had three recent admissions: in [**Month (only) 547**] for MS changes, in [**Month (only) **]
with mental status changes and Ecoli UTI, in [**Month (only) 205**] with mental
status changes and found to have hyponatremia responsive to
steriod and IVF as well as Enterococci UTI. Her hospital course
by system is as follows:

1. hyponatremia - At presentation, her Na was 117, she was
corrected slowly. Within 5 hours, her Na was 121, at which time
she had one ? seizure episode with grimacing and clenching her
hands--this quickly resolved with IV ativan and Decadron. She
subsequently developed hypotension with SBP to the 90's and
became unresponsive. She received fluid rescucitation of 3L NS
and transferred to ICU for further monitoring. In ICU, her Na
corrected slowly by NS infusion at a rate calculated for optimal
correction. Na returned to 142 at 18 hours after presentation.
She received a total of 1.5 L of NS while in ICU. She was
transferred to medicine floor on HD#2 ([**8-25**]). Her serum sodium
was maintained within normal limit while patient was NPO for
poor MS. She was also started on IV hydrocortisone 50 mg [**Hospital1 **],
which was later switched to PO prednisone 10mg for possible
adrenal insufficiency. Her antihypertensive med lisinopril was
discontinued becuase it was thought of as possibly causing
SIADH. Her sodium only dropped on one occassion to 129 on HD#4
([**8-27**]) while pt on [**2-9**] NS. With improved mental status, she was
started on a high protein, high salt diet, with the thought that
her severe hyponatremia was likely at least partially due to
severe dehydration and poor PO intake of electrolytes. Her Na
has remained in the normal range two days off IVF at discharge.
In terms of work up of the causes of her hyponatremia, it is
really unclear whether she has SIADH or not, she certainly has
all the reasons to have it: brain tumor/XRT/surgery/meds,
however, because she presented with such severe hyponatremai and
MS changes, NS infusion was started before serum osm/urine osm
were obtained. We did obtain on [**8-27**] a set of serum osm/urine
osm, however, the urine and blood specimens were obtained 13
hours apart and by the time the urine sample was collected, the
serum Na was already normalized. Because of her recent 2
admissions both with hyponatremia, it is unlikely
dehydration/poor po is the only cause. This is probably a
multifactorial process, with SIADH, dehydration/nutrition
deficit and possiblly adrenal insufficiency all contributing to
the extremely low Na. It is thought by the team that patient
will need endocrine and renal workup as an outpatient once acute
issues are solved. Appropriate followup are arranged as such.
She is to be discharged to nursing home with weekly Na checks.

2. Altered mental status - at presentation, it was likely
secondary to hyponatremia, but she got head CT which ruled out
acute CNS process.Then when her MS worsened with Na correction,
ativan sedation, acute response to high dose steroid or central
pontine myelinosis were suspected as the cause. However, CPM is
a pathological process without effective treatment. Her mental
status slowly improved with correction of Na, increased pO
intake and IVF. At discharge, she returned to her baseline
mentation.

3. h/o sz - In addition to the seizure occured in ED, she had
two more seizure episodes witnessed by family on [**8-25**], both of
which resolved spontaneously within seconds. She was restarted
on keppra, which was discontinued 2 weeks ago because of
sedative effect. Then her antiseizure meds were adjusted by
neuro. At discharge, she was taking only 100mg qhs, this dose is
to continue until [**9-10**] (2wk course0. Then she is to take
Zonisamide 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for two more weeks and to be followed up
with Dr .[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] to adjust the dose if needed. An EED was done
while in hospital, which was non-focal.

4. uti - initially covered empirically with ctx/ampi  Urine
culture grew out 10k to 100k E coli, resistant to amp and
sensitive to Ceftriaxone. AMP d/c-ed [**8-28**]. Continued Ceftriaxone
for a total of 7 days. Will go home on f
