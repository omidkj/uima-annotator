Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 88 yo m with CAD s/p CABG, anemia, ESRD (not on HD), h/o
CHF, presents with episode of chest pain. Pt was doing work in
his yard yesterday, and then experienced [**8-4**] sub-sternal, dull,
chest pain associated with SOB and palpitations. It lasted about
20 minutes ago, he then rested, and the pain improved, although
he said he still had low-level pain for several hours. No N/V.
No F/C.  Pt also said he has had PND and mild orthopnea over
past 2 days. He had been on Lasix in the past, but this was
stopped approx 1 week ago. Pt reports increasing LE swelling
since stopping Lasix. Of note, pt says he had similar episode of
chest pain 1 year ago, and was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] with CHF.
.
Pt reportedly received ASA today (although he now says this is
making his stomach "burn"). Also per ED triage sheet had HR 40's
with bigeminy in the field. He currently denies CP, but c/o LLE
cramp (he says he chronically gets LE cramping).  He also
complains of nausea and "acid" taste in his throat from his
GERD.

MICRO:
Sputum Cx ([**5-3**]): contaminated
.
IMAGING:
ECG ([**4-29**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 60. Borderline first degree
A-V block. Downsloping lateral ST segments are non-specific.
.
CXR Portable ([**4-29**]):
FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "upright "with
excessive
lordotic positioning and no comparisons. The patient is status
post median
sternotomy and apparent CABG with six intact cerclage wires.
Allowing for the factors above, there is borderline LV
enlargement but no pulmonary vascular congestion or other
definite evidence of CHF. There is rounded blunting of the left
CP angle, which may represent chronic pleural thickening related
to the surgery. No acute airspace process is seen. There are
atherosclerotic changes involving the thoracic aorta.
IMPRESSION: Limited study, status post CABG with no definite
acute process.
.
CXR Portable ([**4-30**]): The opacification in the right lung has
developed over 24 hours, accompanied by new mild pulmonary edema
on the left. Findings suggest pulmonary hemorrhage or severe
aspiration pneumonia on the right and may be accompanied by a
small-to-moderate pleural effusion. Heart size top normal
unchanged.
.
Left LENIs ([**4-30**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in the left leg.
.
TTE ([**4-30**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF 55-60%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
ECG ([**4-30**]): Sinus rhythm with multifocal PVCs, Inferior/lateral
ST-T changes suggest ischemia, Since previous tracing of the
same date, ST segment depression more pronounced
.
ECG ([**4-30**]): Sinus rhythm with borderline first degree A-V block.
Poor R wave progression. Inferolateral ST-T wave changes suggest
myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2126-4-29**]
there is slight ST segment elevation in lead III with a biphasic
T wave. ST segment depression is more pronounced and the lateral
T waves are now upright.
.
CXR Portable ([**5-1**]): Previously present widespread asymmetrical
air space opacification affecting the right lung to a greater
degree than the left has markedly improved with residual subtle
hazy opacities remaining in the right lung and minimal patchy
opacity in the left retrocardiac area. It is uncertain whether
this represents resolving asymmetrical edema or if there was a
secondary superimposed process in the right lung such as
aspiration. Small pleural effusions were present bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of Breath: The patient presented with SOB in the
setting of chest pain during exertion, also with increased PND
and orthopnea after his Lasix had been discontinued 1 week prior
to admission. During his hospitalization, he developed acute
onset SOB thoug
