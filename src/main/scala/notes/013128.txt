Allergies:
iodine dye

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 110088**] is 84M with history of CAD s/p 5V CABG ([**2124**]), 3V
redo CABG in [**2134**] with porcine AVR, ischemic CM (EF 45%), HTN,
HLD, R AKA amputation presents with dyspnea X 2-3 days to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital. As per report, the patient has been getting
more dyspneic with exertion, with his lasix recently increased
by his cardiologist. Over the last three days, the patient
reports having increasing edema, orthopnea, and DOE with
ambulation from bed to bathroon. Denies any CP, no syncope,
palpitations, or PRN. Does endorse throat pain, ?anginal
equivalent. At [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital he was in acute heart
failure, with O2 saturations of 94% on 6L, trop 0.35. CXR
notable for b/l effusions, pulmonary congestionwas given lasix.
While there the patient received ASA 162 mg, Lasix 40 mg,
rocephine 1 GM, and was started on heparin drip. Of note, in
response to diuresis was noted to have systolic pressures dip
into the 90s, at which point he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Of
note patient had admission in [**4-14**] and diagnosed with meningioma
and intracerebral aneurysms.
In the ED, vitals were: 97.9 ??????F (36.6 ??????C), Pulse: 76, RR: 20,
BP: 90/60, Rhythm: Sinus Rhythm, O2Sat: 96, O2Flow: 4L , Pain: 0

The [**Name (NI) **] pt given ASA 325, Rocephin 1 gm for CXR from outside
hospital showing possible PNA?, and Heparin 4200 unit bolus and
Gtt @ 12U/kg/hr. ED cardiologist saw him here and noted
hypotension to the 80s although the patient was mentating and
had good urine output. An echocardiogram was done in the ED (by
the cardiology fellow) which showed reduced EF from [**4-14**] and
septal WMA consistent with possible missed anterior MI. In ED
patient became hypotensive SBPs 70s and given 750 CC IVF bolus
after no response dopamine was started. Later pt's 02 sat
dropped to 80s, ?evolving EKG changes, non rebreather was tried
which didnt work then pt was intubated. pt SBP dipped into the
60s levofed was started in addition to dopamine

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan

Assessment: Mr. [**Known lastname 110088**] is 84M with history of CAD s/p CABG x2,
AVR in [**2134**], ischemic CM (EF 45% in [**4-14**]) p/w worsening dyspnea,
worse EF 20% found to be in cardiogenic and septic shock, has
strep bovis positive blood cultures concerning for prosthetic
valve endocarditis.

ACUTE ISSUES
#Shock: Multifactorial: The initial presentation included a
broad differential of cardiogenic shock, septic shock, and
adrenal insuffiency. Cardiogenic shock in the setting of recent
anterior MI causing hypokinesis of anterior wall and
cardiomyopathy and poor outflow from the heart. Septic in
setting of positive blood culutures growingout strep bovis.
Source of infection could be prostetic aortic valve
endocarditis, initially coming from gut vs mouth.

      He was initially intubated after flash pulmonary edema
ensued in the ED s/p fluid bolus for hypotension and then put on
levophed and dopamine for pressor support while concominantly
adding a lasix gtt for diuresis of pulmonary edema.  Stress dose
steroids were also initiated as the patient was chronically on
decadron for menigiomas.  A central line was placed for adequate
pressor administration.  The patient's blood pressures and urine
output were adequate and the dopamine and levophed were titrated
off.  He then self-extubated without complications.  Shortly
after, troponin and CK-MB were noted to be drastically elevated
at 7.58 and 99.  However, because of goals of care (family did
not want major surgery and interventions), no cardiac
catheterization was undertaken.  And although there was evidence
of septic shock on initial presentation as he met SIRS criteria
and we had [**4-6**] BCx positive for Strep Gallalyticus, he
clinically did not appear septic as there were no pressor
requirements and no IVF was given.  The patient was initiated
with ceftriaxone to treat his bacteremia and the steriods were
tapered down to his home dose.  The central line was removed and
a PICC line was placed for possibility of needing home IV
antibiotics. ID was consulted and patient can go home on PO amox
1 g [**Hospital1 **] indefinitely because he is goign home on hospice.
Before discharge, the PICC line was removed as no IV abx will be
given at home.  Radiology called right before discharge and
noted a possible infiltrate on latest CXR.  Patient was
discharged on Levaquin (10 day regimen) for treatment of
possible community acquired pneumonia.

#End of Life Care: Pt's family wanted pt to be DNR DNI after pt
was extubated. Pt's family wanted home hospice so we got
palliative care involved.  He will be discharged on all oral
medications to treat his presumptive bacteremia/endocarditis and
pneumonia.  Hospice will initiate his home O2 requirement

#Episodes of resp distress: The patient had multiple episodes of
shortness of breath and anxiety after extubation.  Pt has tachy,
HTN and incr RR and lower sats in the 80s when these occurred.
It was felt to be episodes of flash pulmonary edema which
responded to morphine, nitro dri, lasix. It is unclear why pt
continues to have these episodes.  Possibly ACS related.  Likely
a combination of anxiety, tachycardia/HTN causing increase in
afterload, and ongoing ischemia which ultimately led to flash
pulmonary edema.  Along with addition of Metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **],
we added captopril to decrease his flash pulmonary edema. We
gave lasix PRN a
