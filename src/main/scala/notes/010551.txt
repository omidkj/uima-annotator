Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 yo F with a history of DM2 and HTN who presents
with L greater than R flank pain, associated with nausea and
visual blurring. Patient has had L sided flank pain since the
night prior to admission. This was associated with blurry vision
for the past 1-2 days, and headache over the last few hours. She
has not had dysuria, hematuria, vomiting, or fevers. No
abdominal pain. No diarrhea.

She does have a history of HTN and is compliant with her
antihypertensives.

Of note, she had much more severe flank pain 6 weeks ago. She
was told to drink fluids for potential kidney stone. She had
imaging done in [**State 760**], at her home, that showed no obvious
stones. Apparently she was referred to a nephrologist at that
time and was told she had some evidence of kidney failure. She
was first told she may have kidney failure in [**2198-4-22**]. She was
seen by nephrology, but does not know any further details. She
has never been on dialysis before. She did not have this flank
pain at that time.

Patient brought labs from previous appointments.
[**1-16**] Cr 3.29.
[**2-4**] Cr 3.07, HCT 31.1.

In the emergency department BP was 221/71. She recived 200mg IV
labetalol and was started on a 1mg/min labetalol gtt. BP came
down to 176/92. HR 77. RR21. O2 sat 88%.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's flank pain is much improved.
No headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of
breath.

Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes
2. Asthma
3. Depression
4. History of pulmonary nodules consistent with calcified
granuloma
5. Menorrhagia
6. Hypertension
7. Hypercholesterolemia.
8. Chronic lower back pain.
9. CRI, most recent Cr values in the low 3's.
10. Thyroid mass - she reports she was told she had a 2 cm
thyroid mass and needed to have this biopsied.
11. Osteoporosis


Social History:
She lives in NJ currently with a roommate, but wants to move
back to MA. Smokes 1 ppd. Denies alcohol or drug use.

[**2199-3-18**]  URINE URINE CULTURE- < 10,000 organisms

Urine cytology ([**3-21**]) - pending

STUDIES:
CT abd/pelvis ([**3-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of diverticulosis or urinary tract calculi.
2. Unchanged large calcified fibroid uterus.
3. 2.9-cm low-attenuation left renal lesion larger than prior
study. Further evaluation with MR would be optimal. However,
given the patient's renal failure, US as an initial study is
recommended.

Head CT ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Sclerotic focus in the left humeral head, could reflect a
bone island given lack of underlying risk factors for
metastasis. Correlation with prior imaging to confirm stability
is recommended.

Renal US and doppler ([**3-19**]):
FINDINGS: There is a partly cystic/partly solid isoechoic mass
again seen in the mid portion of the left kidney which
corresponds with the recent CT
findings. This mass measures 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.8 cm and demonstrates
some
vascular flow within it on color Doppler imaging. The appearance
of this mass may be suggestive of cystic renal cell carcinoma.
No additional focal
abnormality is seen in the left kidney and there is no
hydronephrosis. The
left kidney measures 9.2 cm. The right kidney measures 10.0 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis and no stone or mass is seen in the
right kidney.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained. Arterial waveforms of the main renal artery in the
right kidney
demonstrates a slight delay in upstrokes which may indicate some
renal artery stenosis. Sharp upstrokes are identified in the
arterial waveform of the renal artery in the left kidney.
Resistive indices of the intraparenchymal arteries on the right
kidney are slightly elevated ranging from .78-.80. The resistive
indices of the intraparenchymal arteries in the left kidney are
also slightly elevated ranging from .73-.83.

IMPRESSION: 1) Slight upstroke delay of the arterial waveforms
in the main
renal artery of the right kidney may indicate some renal artery
stenosis on the right side. Bilateral moderately elevated RI's.
2. Cystic and solid mass in the mi
