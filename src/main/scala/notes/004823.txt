Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
79 y/o M of PMHx of Atrial Fib, Diastolic CHF, Hypertrophic CMP,
CAD s/p stenting and hyperthyroidism who presented to the ED
with 4 days of productive cough, shortness of breath,
progressive DOE, low grade fevers/chills and decreased appetite.


In the ED, initial VS were: T 100.1 P 100 BP 155/106 RR 20 Sats
90% on RA. Initial EKG revealed rapid afib and HR trended up
into 150-180s, pt was started on dilt gtt at 5mg/hr which
acheived good rate control. Portable CXR showed pulmonary edema
& possible RUL opacity. Labs revealed a troponin of 0.06, CK
181, MB 3 and lactate of 2.8 that came down to 2.2 after 2L of
NS IVF. Pt received Aspirin 325mg, Ceftriaxone 1gram &
Levofloxacin 750mg for possible RUL infiltrate.

On arrival to the ICU, pt was feeling better but still reporting
cough, congestion and shortness of breath. Pt also reported some
new abdominal fullness, decreased appetite and subjective
fever/chills. He had possible sick contacts from a wake he
attended last week. He denied CP but reported orthopnea and
progressive DOE.

Past Medical History:
-Chronic permanent atrial fibrillation

CXR [**2125-1-1**]: Stable cardiomegaly with mild CHF.

TTE [**2125-1-4**]: IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with a small LV cavity and preserved systolic
function. Dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle with mild
systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2124-7-25**],
severity of mitral regurgitation may be slightly worse. The
other findings appear similar.

CXR [**2125-1-7**]: New right lower lobe consolidation which could be
pneumonia in
the appropriate clinical setting.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 yo male with pmh of chronic a.fib, hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy, CAD s/p stent, hyperthyroidism, and
diastolic HF who presented with cough, progressive dyspnea now
with RSV bronchiolitis complicated by PNA.

# RSV bronchiolitis/Hypoxia:  His inital dyspnea and hypoxia
were likely due to RSV bronchiolitis as the viral screen
returned RSV positive.  [**Month (only) 116**] also have a component of underlying
lung disease contriubuting to his dyspnea.  The PNA (as below)
may also be contributing to his hypoxia.  By the end of his
hospitalization he was also slightly volume overloaded.  By
discharge he was able to maintain RA sats in the mid 90's and
dropped to the low 90's on RA with ambulation.  He was given a
few doses of IV lasix for diuresis and was discharged on his
home lasix regimen of 40 mg daily.  He was treated with standing
xopenex and atrovent nebs as well as flovent.  He was discharged
on his home advair as well as albuterol inhaler prn. By
discharge he was no longer short of breath and had no DOE.

# PNA: The patient was noted to have new crackles on exam a few
days prior to admission and underwent a CXR which showed a new
RML infiltrate likely representing PNA.  This was thought to be
a community-aquired PNA as there had been a slight suggestion of
PNA on his admission CXR.  Likely secondary to his RSV
bronchiolitis.
He was discharged to complete a 5 day course of levofloxacin 750
mg daily.

# Atrial Fibrillation: The patient presented in the ED with HR
of 100 and developed rapid Afib in the ED. He was started on a
Dilt gtt and his rate came down to 100s.  He was adimtted to the
MICU on the dilt gtt and weaned off overnight and transitioned
to PO home meds.  TSH WNL.  He is on coumadin at home.
Metoprolol increased due to persistent a.fib with occasional
RVR.  Prior to discharge he was started on diltiazem 30 mg qid
and placed back on metoprolol XL 100 mg daily.  He was
discharged on diltiazem 120 mg daily and metoprolol 100 mg
daily.  He will have telemonitoring so that his vital signs can
be monitored occasionally by his PCP from home.  He will also
follow up with his PCP two days after discharge.

# Supratherapeutic INR/hematuria: On admission he was found to
have a supratherapeutic INR.  His coumadin was held, however
given his poor po intake while ill, his INR remained elevated
for a few days.  During this time he developed hematuria due to
foley trauma.  His foley was pulled and the hematuria slowly
resolved.  He was placed back on coumadin once his INR dropped
betwee
