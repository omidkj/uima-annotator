[**2132-12-3**] UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB:
High density material within the JP drain, suggests extraluminal
leak. No
definite leak is visualized, though there is a possible linear
focus of
extraluminal contrast near the gastrojejunostomy. No holdup or
stenosis

[**2132-12-4**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:
1. Mediastinal and hilar venous engorgement.
2. Retrocardiac atelectasis with possible small bilateral
pleural effusions.

[**2132-12-5**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:
No pulmonary edema


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to pre-op on [**2132-12-2**]. Pt was
evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room for
laparoscopic gastric banding. The patient was difficult to
intubate due to thickened neck circumference.  Also, there was
difficulty placing the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube into the stomach,
therefore, an open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed.
Otherwise, there were no adverse events in the operating room;
please see the operative note for details. Pt was extubated,
taken to the PACU until stable, then transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for
observation.

On hospital day #1 an UGI was performed, which showed high
density material within the JP drain, suggestive of an
intraluminal leak.  Given the results of the study, the patient
was monitored closely w
