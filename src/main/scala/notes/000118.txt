History of Present Illness:
61 M Cantonese-speaking only, former smoker who quit 10 yrs ago,
admitted on Mon to [**Location **] service for workup of L lung
mass which is likely malignant, here with dysphagia x 2 months,
hemoptysis x 2 months, weight loss of [**5-10**] lbs, reduced PO
intake, became acutely SOB today at 2 pm. He was doing very well
yesterday, was not SOB at all, RR 14, was very comfortable. He
has been in isolation getting r/o for TB (due to hemoptysis),
and bronch was planned for tomorrow PM. Throughout today, he
developed worsening SOB, with O2 sats ranging from 95-98% RA at
2 pm, 92% RA at 5 pm, 87% 2L nc at 9 pm, 85% 100% FM at 11 pm.
.
He became severely SOB, with no rales, no wheezing, first ABG
7.35/60/68, O2 sat 95-98% RA. ENT was consulted for SOB, and
found normal vocal cords, normal posterior pharynx, no lesions
on vocal cords, +mediastinal lymph nodes. CXR shows no
cardiomegaly, no pleural effusions, no infiltrate. Earlier
today, patient was sitting straight up on the side of bed
drooling, with severe SOB, RR 30. EKG showed mild STD in lateral
leads, no previous for comparison. Patient failed bedside video
swallow study.

Cytology:
Pleural fluid negative x3 for malignancy
CT guided bx positive for adenoca of lung
.
Imaging:
[**1-24**]: CT Abd: 1. Focal liver lesions with peripheral
enhancement, most likely representing hemangiomas.
2. 2 cm left adrenal nodule with enhancement, worrisome for
metastasis in this patient with lung mass. PET CT may help for
further staging.
3. Small free fluid in the lower pelvis.
.
[**1-23**]: CT chest: Chest CT [**2164-1-23**]: (1) Mass or mass-like
consolidation in two segments of the left upper lobe.  (2) Small
left adrenal mass.
Extensive heterogeneity in liver texture.  (3) Esophageal
distention, probably functional.
.
[**1-26**]: ECHO: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid septal hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR upon admission:
1. New left upper lobe consolidation occupying predominantly the
upper portion of the lobe in addition to known left upper
lobe/lingular consolidation/mass. These finding may represent
massive aspiration or hemorrhage
2. New retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis.
.
CXR upon discharge:
Tracheostomy tube and G-tube seen in relatively stable position.
Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable. There is
improved aeration of the left lung with persistent atelectasis
and consolidation with air bronchograms noted. Left-sided PICC
seen with the tip in the region of the cavoatrial junction.
IMPRESSION: Improved aeration in the left lung with persistent
atelectasis and consolidation


Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo former smoker admitted for workup of L lung mass after
presenting w/ c/o dysphagia, hemoptysis, and weight loss x 2
months, admitted to the ICU for acute SOB.  Hospital course by
problem:
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**2-3**] mucus plugging of L
upper lung field complicated by ? postobstructive pneumonia.
Bronchoscopy was performed x4 each time with evidence of mucus
plugging and thick secretions.  Sputum cultures did not,
however, yield growth in order to guide antibiotic coverage.  He
was continued on zosyn and vancomycin x14 days then switched to
meropenem for 1 week to treat possible ESBLs.  Following his 4th
bronchoscopy, he was tolerating trials of PS.  Thereafter, we
placed a trach on [**2-8**] which he tolerated well.  We aggressively
diuresed.  On [**2-16**] he did very well on a trach collar and
remained off the vent for >24 consecutive hours.  We recommend
continued lasix 40mg PO daily for approx 1-2 weeks as he was
quite volume overloaded during this admission.
.
# Adenoca of the lung: CT guided biopsy showed adenoca of the
lung.  He had a negative head CT for mets but did have an
adrenal met noted on abdominal CT scan.  He had pleural fluid
neg x3 for malignancy.  We were unable to accurately stage him
without a PET scan.  Given his poor respiratory status and
extensive disease burden, the heme/onc service did not feel that
he would benefit from surgical resection or high dose chemo.  We
did however treat him for a 5 day course of chemoradiation to
help decrease the size of the mass in an attempt to assist with
weaning off the vent.  This may have helped as he was
subsequently off the vent several days after therapy.  The
family and patient are no longer interested in treating this
malignancy.
.
# Cards Vasc: In the setting of hypoxia and hemoptysis, the
patient had a troponin peak to 0.9.  His CKs were negative.  An
echo showed some mid-septal hypokinesis.  It was thought that
this was a demand ischemic event and there were no further
issues during his hospitalization.
..
# Left pneumothorax: Patient had a PTX s/p CT guided biopsy.  He
had a chest tube placed on the left.  It remained in place for
approx one week.  Thereafter the PTX resolved.  He did undergo
VATS with pleurodesis on [**2-8**] given his signifant pleural
effusion.
.
# A fib: on [**2-10**], went into afib with r
