Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ultrasound-guided renal biopsy
CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 35 y/o F with a h/o Type I DM, HTN, CKD, warm
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, depression, and osteoperosis who
was recently on the SIRS service on [**2139-9-15**] when she had a 2
minute cardiac arrest, requiring 5 rounds of CPR, immediately
following a renal biopsy prompting a 1-day admission to the
MICU, who now presents back to the SIRS service with hypoxia,
continuing bilateral pleural effusions, and concern for mixed
respiratory acidemia/metabolic alkalemia of multi-factorial
etiology.
.
The patient was discharged from the SIRS service following
presentation for anaphylactic response to fluoroquinolones, with
subsequent hypoxia due to bilateral pleural effusions of unclear
etiology, a normocytic anemia, and nephrotic syndrome on
[**2139-9-8**]. At that time, the patient was breathing comfortably on
room air following aggressive diruesis, with consistent O2Sats >
95%. She was discharged on Lasix 20 MG PO QD, and soon
redeveloped shortness of breath, LE edema and lethargy prompting
her re-presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-9-12**]. A CXR confirmed the
presence of recurrent bilateral pleural effusions. She had a
desat into the 80s on RA, which resulted in her transfer to the
MICU. She was aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix 40 MG [**Hospital1 **]
overnight, and was then transferred to the SIRS service on
[**2139-9-14**] after a noticeable improvement in her breathing.
.
Given the presence and recurrent nature of her bilateral pleural
effusions, we continued IV Lasix 40 MG [**Hospital1 **] and consulted the
Rheumatology and Renal teams. Both teams agreed that the patient
should pursue a renal biopsy, which was performed on [**2139-9-15**],
and subsequently she had a cardiac arrest. During the procedure,
the patient received Versed 100 MG and Fentanyl 100 MG, and was
conscious and able to follow instructions during the procedure.
Immediately afterwards though, she became unresponsive during
her transit to the recovery room, exhibiting some involuntary
jerking activity and was found to not have a pulse. She received
2 minutes of CPR and subsequently regained responsivness. At
this point she was placed on telemetry where she a normal sinus
rhythm and a palpable pulse. No medication was administered
during the event and she was placed on O2 and then transfered to
the MICU.
.
In the MICU, she was monitored and was stable other than one
episode of hypoglycemia with a blood sugar of 14 on the
[**2139-9-16**], that was immediately managed with IV D50 and she
responded appropriately with improved alertness and appropriate
mental status. A CTA ruled out pulmonary embolus. She was
observed for a few hours and was then transfered to the SIRS
service.
.
On the floor, the patient was found in acute respiratory
distress, with an initial O2Sat in the 40s. The patient was
immediately placed on 4L NC and her O2Sats increased back to the
90s. She exhibited significant somnolence and altered mental
status. An ABG taken on 4L gave results of 7.37/62/67/37 and a
following one on RA was 7.39/61/47/38.
.

Imaging:

CXR ([**9-12**]):
SINGLE AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: There are interval
bilateral
basilar opacity, right slightly worse than left, representing
combination of bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis.
Superimposed infections cannot be excluded. There is no
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours,
and pulmonary vasculature are normal. There is interval removal
of the left-sided PICC line.
IMPRESSION: Interval moderate bibasilar opacities, likely
combination of
pleural effusions and atelectasis, but cannot exclude
superimposed infection.

CXR ([**2139-9-16**]):
As compared to the prior examination, there is improved aeration
at
the lung bases with improvement in atelectasis and effusions as
well as
vascular congestion. No pneumothorax is seen. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged.
.
CT CHEST ([**2139-9-15**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
compressive
atelectasis.
3. Interval improvement of scattered areas of
peri-bronchovascular opacities.
4. Two splenic hypodensities, the anterior lesion subcentimeter
in size and stable, the second 14-mm lesion along the hilum
demonstrates increase in size since [**2136-11-2**].
Differential includes but not limited to cysts, hamartoma,
hemangioma, or lymphangioma. These can
