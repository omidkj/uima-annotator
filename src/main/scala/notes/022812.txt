Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.  [**Known lastname 13260**] is a 75 year old male with severe COPD, prostate ca
s/p lupron and brachytherapy, PAF, urinary retention who
presents with respiratory distress, likely secondary to COPD
exacerbation.

# COPD - AE, Patient is known to have severe COPD. His blood
gasses showed significant hypercarbia and he was initially
wheezing on exam, making COPD exacerbation the most likely
diagnosis.  Patient had significant improvement with nebs,
steroids, antibiotics, lasix.  Got ceftaz/levaquin to cover
severe CAP, however ceftaz stopped given lack of cough, fever,
wbc or clinical suggestion of pneumonia.   He initially diuresed
1L with lasix, but appeared euvolemic so did not have
significant further lasix. Patient will be discharged on slow
Prednisone 40mg PO taper and placed on Spiriva/Combivent/Duoneb.
Patient was observed in the MICU on non-rebreather until
determined to be stable for the floor. Patient completed a seven
day course of Levoquin. Cultures were negative through the
course of the admission. At the time of discharge patient was
sating 94% on baseline oxygen of 2L and 87% 2L on ambulation.

#  HTN.  Patient has HTN.  Home cardiac meds appear to be
diltiazem 240mg [**Hospital1 **] and no BB as well as cozar.  Meds doses
taken from PCP by phone (from memory) which agreed with
paperwork from [**Hospital3 5365**]. Patient's pressures were too low
and the regimen was changed to Diltiazem ER 240 daily.

#  PAF/MAT?.  In house patient had one episode of irregular
heart rate on telemetry.  It remains unclear if this was PAF vs
MAT.  Given the setting of severe COPD exacerbation it is more
likely to be MAT.   Rhythm rapidly converted spontaneously and
he remained in NSR over the next 48 hours.  The patient does
have a history of PAF (athough details unknown).  Given this
history and unclear event in hospital, the patient was started
on Aspirin 325mg PO daily and instructed to further discuss with
his PCP with regards to coumadin anticoagulation for stroke
prevention.

#. Urinary retention.  Has history of prostate cancer s/p
brachytherapy with history of subsequent urinary retention.
Patient was started on flomax, and to continue at home
