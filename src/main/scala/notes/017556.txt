History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111127**] is a 68 year old female who had an open AAA repair in
[**Month (only) **] of last year.  She went to an Outside Hospital (OSH)
complaining of 5d of non-bloody diarrhea and 3d of gradually
worsening abdominal pain, as well as nausea/vomiting for the
past day or so.  Denies fevers and chills.  She underwent a CT
scan of the abdomen/pelvis at the OSH which was concerning for
small bowel ischemia, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
workup.  On arrival here she was found to be intermittently
hypotensive to the 60s, with fluctuating sats, and

abdominal pain when she is awake.  But otherwise denies any
other complaints.

IMAGING:
[**2107-3-26**] OSH CT scan: Lack of enhancement of small bowel
concerning for ischemia, possible closed loop obstruction vs.
mid gut volvulus, SMA patent until region of mesenteric swirling
then disappears.  + Free intraabdominal fluid.

[**2107-4-5**] CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-3**], there has been
placement of a left subclavian PICC line that extends to the
upper portion of the SVC. Right IJ catheter remains in place.
Dobbhoff tube has been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from an Outside Hospital (OSH) on
[**2107-3-26**] and was admitted to the General Surgical Service on
[**2107-3-27**] for emergent exploratory laparotomy for high grade
small bowel obstruction.  In the Emergency Room, the patient was
found to be intermittently hypotensive to the 60s, with
fluctuating saturations, and intermittently obtunded. She was
intubated for inabilty to maintain sats in the ED. Early on
[**2107-3-27**], the patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, lysis
of adhesions, detorsion of the bowel, which went well without
complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the
patient was transferred to the SICU for post-operative care. The
patient was hemodynamically stable.
.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient initially received
Fentanyl, then Morphine IV PRN with good effect and adequate
pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient was
transitioned to oral pain medications with continued good
effect. She remained neurologically intact.
.
CV: Initially hypotensive secondary to question of SIRS and
intravascular volume depletion, which responded to IV fluid
rescusitation, electrolyte repletion and administration of
albumin. Patient then became hypertensive post-operatively,
which required the initialtion of Metoprolol IV, as well as
multiple doses of IV Lasix and Hydralazine. When tolerating a
diet, IV Metoprolol was transitioned to the oral formulation and
the patient no longer required IV Hydralazine with good blood
pressure control. The patient subsequently remained stable from
a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely
monitored.
.
Pulmonary: As above, the patient was intubated in the ED.
Post-operatively, she was kept intubated secondary to the
metabilic and respiratory acidosis. She was extubated on POD#1,
but then re-intubated on POD#4 due to hypoxemic respiratory
failure beleived to be due to an acute exacerbation of her
underlying COPD. She was started on Methylprednisone,
around-the-clock nebulizer treatments, and humidification. On
POD#5, IV Vancomycin and Zosyn were also started. She was
diuresed. These intervetions proved effective, and by POD#6, she
was extubated and subsequently remained stable. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirrometry as well as
use of her home inhalers and PRN nebulizer treatments were
continued throughout hospitalization. At discharge, she was on
[**1-29**] liters by nasal cannula to maintain her SaO2 >93-94%.
.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. The patient self-discontinued her NGT on POD#2, which
was replaced, but then later removed on POD#4. A dobbhoff was
placed, and tubefeeds started on POD#5. On POD#6, she was
started on sips. Her diet was progressively advanced to regular
by POD#7, which was well tolerated, and tubefeeds discontinued.
Foley was discontinued on POD#8; she subsequently voided without
problem. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and
IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.
.
ID: Given re-intubation due to possible COPD exacerbation versus
pneumonia, the patient was empirically started on IV Vancomycin
and Zosyn on POD#5 after the patient was pan-cultured. Sputum
gram stain revealed GPRs, GNRs, and GPs and the urine culture
grew MRSA. Sputum also later grew E. coli and MRSA. It was
determined that the patient would require IV Vancomycin and
Cipro until [**2107-4-15**], thus a PICC line
