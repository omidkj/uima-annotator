Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 634**] was taken to the OR for a sigmoid colectomy.  See
Dr.[**Name (NI) 6275**] Operative Note for detail.

On POD#1, she did well.  She had good pain control with her
epidural and was out of bed to a chair.  On POD#2, Ms. [**Known lastname 634**]
was noted to be hypotensive over night with a systolic blood
pressure in the 80s.  Her pressure responded to fluid boluses.
She was also noted to have some bleeding around her epidural
site.  Her SC heparin was discontinued and the epidural was
capped.  Her hematocrit was 24 and a repeat hematocrit was 25,
and became as low as 18.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] PTT was >150 and her
INR 1.8.  She was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring
and neuro checks.   On exam, Ms. [**Known lastname 634**] had a soft abdomen,
mild staining of her dressing, but no overt signs of a hematoma.
 She remained clinically stable and neurologically intact. She
received a total of 7units of FFP and 3 units of pRBCs.  Her
coagulopathy was corrected and her hematocrit rose to 27.  Some
oozing continued from her epidural site and she was placed on
Vancomycin for empiric coverage.  Later that evening, on exam, a
more noticeable and tender hematoma was evident at the left
inferior aspect of her incision. On POD#3, the patient received
2 additional units of pRBCs to a hematocrit of 30. She was
closely monitored and was found to have a stable hematocrit. The
remainder of the patient's course in the ICU was unremarkable.
She was transferred to the floor on POD#6 in stable condition.
The remainder of the patient's course was complicated by
prolonged post-operative ileus. She was seen by the physical
therapy service and routinely ambulated. She was advanced to a
clear liquid diet. On POD#10, the patient was started on
levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia. On POD#11, the patient
experienced an episode of nausea with ongoing nausea. A KUB was
obtained, and showed multiple loops of dilated bowel with
air-fluid levels, consistent with ileus. She also experienced an
episode of diarrhea and was started on PO vancomycin for emperic
threatment for Clostridium difficile infection. The remainder of
the patient's course was unremarkable. Her ileus slowly
resolved, and her diet was advanced to soft solids. She was able
to ambulate well. At the time of discharge to home, the patient
was noted to be stable, tolerating PO intake and experiencing
formed stools. She was discharged with instructions for
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 98416**] of the
oncology service.
