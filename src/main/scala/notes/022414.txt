Imaging:
CT C-Spine [**4-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine.
2. Metallic fragments consistent with a gunshot wound are seen.
The squamous part of the temporal bone is shattered, and the
head of the mandible is disrupted. Metallic fragments,
pneumocephalus and hemorrhage are seen within the middle cranial
fossa (for further details, see the head CT from today).
ATTENDING NOTE: Incidentally noted is somewhat hypolastic
odontoid process, a congenital anomaly. No signs of
atlanto-axial subluxation seen.

CT Head [**4-22**]:
FINDINGS:
High-density material consistent with metallic fragments are
seen adjacent to the right TMJ where there are bone fragments
(series 3, image 6). The lateral wall of the right maxilla is
fractured (series 3, image 8), as is the anterior wall (series
3, image 7). High attenuating material within the right
maxillary sinus is consistent with blood. Low density material
opacifies the other maxillary sinus. The squamous portion of the
temporal bone is shattered (series 3, image 9) and numerous
[**Last Name (un) 2043**] fragments are seen. There is a fracture of the right
zygoma (series 3, image 11). Metallic fragments and a 1.2 x 1.5
cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage are seen in the right temporal
lobe (series 2, image 15). Locules of air and metallic fragments
are seen throughout the brain tracking superiorly to where a
significant bullet fragment is seen adjacent to the left frontal
bone (series 3, image 27). There is diffuse sulcal effacement
indicative of significant cerebral edema. The lateral ventricles
appear effaced. The basal cisterns are obliterated indicative of
uncal herniation and the cerebellar tonsils are seen in the
foramen magnum.
IMPRESSION:
1. Gunshot wound to the head traversing from the right TMJ
superiorly to
where bullet fragments are seen adjacent to the left frontal
bone. There is
associated pneumocephalus, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, uncal,
and brainstem herniation.
2. Significant and complex fractures of the squamous portion of
the temporal bone, zygomatic process and anterior and lateral
walls of the maxilla as enumerated above.

CTA Head [**4-23**]:
CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD:
The CT angiography of the head demonstrates evidence of clipping
of the right middle cerebral artery and right supraclinoid
internal carotid artery. There is a flow gap identified in the
M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. The vascular
structures in the sylvian region of right middle cerebral artery
are visualized which could be secondary to leptomeningeal
collaterals. There is no active extravasation identified. The
left middle cerebral artery demonstrate normal appearance.
Normal vascular appearance is also seen in the posterior
circulation with regards to stenosis or occlusion. There appears
to be mild vascular spasm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Gunshot wound to the head with multiple bullet fragments in
both frontal
lobes and left frontal intracerebral hematoma. Left-sided
subdural hematoma.
2. Evolving right middle cerebral artery infarct.
3. Clips in the region of right middle cerebral artery and
supraclinoid
internal carotid artery.
4. Right-sided craniectomy with mild bulging of the brain
substance through
the craniectomy defect.
5. Central herniation and right-sided inferior displacement of
the uncus.
6. CT angiography shows occlusion of the right middle cerebral
artery
secondary to clipping. Collateral circulation is seen in the
right sylvian
branches of the middle cerebral artery. Mild nonocclusive
vasospasm is also
identified. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema is seen as well as
the emphysema in the right orbit. Better evaluation of the
facial bones can be obtained with facial CT if clinically
indicated for assessment of fractures.

Head CT [**4-24**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Compared to one day prior, there is
increased edema
within the right frontal lobe with increased herniation of the
brain
parenchyma through the right frontal calvarial defect.
Comparison and exact
measurement is difficult, however, the brain extends
approximately 2.2 cm
beyond the expected location (2:21) compared to 1.5 cm one day
prior. There
is slight bowing of the septum pellucidum towards the right,
however, no
significant midline shift or subfalcine herniation. The
ventricles are stable in size and configuration. The basilar
cisterns are difficult to evaluate due to streak artifact from
the bullet fragments in the right frontotemporal area, however,
appear preserved with no definite evidence of uncal herniation.
Left frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage is stable. Small
left-sided subdural hemorrhage is also stable. Multiple
fragments and sutures in the right MCA bifurcation are
unchanged. Pneumocephalus and blood products in the surgical bed
have decreased slightly. No evidence of new hemorrhage. Again
there is high-density opacification within the right maxillary
sinus and moderately extensive opacification within the
ethmoidal air cells and sphenoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Increasing edema and herniation of the right
cerebral hemisphere through the frontoparietal craniectomy
defect. No new subfalcine or uncal herniation. Unchanged
ventricular size.

Head CT [**4-27**]:
FINDINGS: Overall, there is minimal change when compared to the
previous
examinations. Again seen is a large amount of brain edema,
predominantly at
the right frontal lobe with transgaleal herniation through the
large right
frontoparietal craniectomy site. The degree of herniation
appears increased
when compared to the most recent exam, now measuring
approximately 26 mm
(2:19) as compared with 21 mm previously. The degree of
rightward shift of
normal midline structures is unchanged. Ventricles are unchanged
in size and configuration. The left frontal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage is unchanged
