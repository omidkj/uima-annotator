Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness and Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Primary care physician: [**Name10 (NameIs) 59215**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 6924**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 8417**]

History of present illness:
Patient is an 88 year old female with history of atrial
fibrillation, type 2 diabetes melltius, and hypertension who
presented with weakness and cough. According to the patient, her
family, and her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] began to feel increasingly week over
the last few days, as well as noted a minimally productive
nagging cough. The patient and her family called her PCP on
[**Name9 (PRE) 1017**] ([**2160-12-15**]), at which time it was recommended she come
to the ED for evaluation. The patient and her family did not
feel that she was ill enough for that, so an additional dose of
lasix was prescribed. She was then started on a Z-pack as well.
Given that she continued to feel poorly and more weak, she was
brought in to the ED for evaluation after it was found that her
oxygen saturations were low.

In the emergency room, her initial vital signs were temperature
of 97.3, blood pressure of 140/73, heart rate of 123,
respiratory rate of 24, and oxygen saturation of 86% on 4L NC
and room air (of note she was reportedly only breathing through
her mouth). She was given 1 gram of ceftriaxone and 1 gram of
vancomycin. She was put on a face-mask with improvement in her
oxygenation. A chest x-ray was completed and a left lower lobe
pneumonia was diagnosed. ABG in the ED was 7.31/70/291, and then
7.30/72/84. An initial lactate was 2.7. She was admitted to the
ICU given her oxygen requirement (Non-rebreather), and tachypnea
(rate in 30's), as well as possible need for BiPAP. Her code
status was confirmed DNR/DNI with both patient and her family.

PCP was called and offered the additional history: patient was
feeling weak, wasn't herself over weekend, family didn't want to
bring her in (daughter). She was started on z-pack, daughter
stayed with patient overnight, and NP saw her in the morning
(oxygen 80% on RA, HR 100, BP 110/70, temperature 96.3)-- at
that time she was weaker and hypoxic, so sent to hospital. She
is a new patient to [**Hospital3 **], has no known history of CHF,
but based on office visit earlier this month to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 59216**]
fluid overloaded with pedal edema and rales. At that time, her
BP was on lower side (90/60), and she was not SOB ([**Month (only) 1096**]
suspicious of diastolic dysfunction.

Past Medical History:
- Atrial fibrillation, s/p pacemaker placement due to atrial
fibrillation without ventricular response, on coumadin
- Hypertension
- Diabetes mellitus type 2
- Hyperlipidemia
- Peripheral vascular disease
- Peptic ulcer disease
- Sick sinus syndrome status-post pacemaker placement

- Skin cancer
No known history of CHF, coronary artery disease, or COPD.


Social History:
Patient lives in lives in [**Hospital3 59217**]
community. At baseline she uses a walker for assistance. She has
never smoked, and drinks alcohol rarely.

Family History:
[**Name (NI) **] mother died sudden death at 85 and MGM died at 75 in
sleep. MGM with angina. No significant past medical history on
paternal side.

Physical Exam:
Vital Signs:  Afebrile, BP 124/72, HR 100-110's, RR 20's, 98% on
35% face-mask
General: Pleasant female sitting in bed, sleeping but easily
aroused, in NAD, appropriate in conversation, speaking full
sentences without distress
HEENT: NC/AT. MMM, injection of conjunctival mucosa, erythema
around eyes, no scleral icterus. MMM.
Neck: Supple, JVP about 9 cm
Lungs: Rales up 1/2 right side and at left base, some dullness
to percussion a bases. No accessory muscle use.
Cardiac: Irregulary irregular, tachycardic no m/g/r
Abdomen: Distended with some typhany, but soft, +BS, non-tender

Extr: 3+ Pitting edema up to knees bilaterally, right leg
slightly great in size as compared to left, right leg also
slightly warmer as compared to left, with increased pigmentation
across shins. DP/PT 2+ bilaterally. No clubbing/cyanosis.

IMAGING
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2160-12-16**] 11:49 AM
Massive cardiomegaly is again noted, unchanged, and a
pericardial
effusion component may be possible. Pulmonary vascularity
appears within
normal limits however there are new small bilateral pleural
effusions.
Retrocardiac and right lower lobe opacities may reflect
combination of
atelectasis and effusion however underlying consolidation cannot
be entirely excluded on this view. Left-sided pacemaker is again
noted with single lead terminating in the expected region of the
right ventricle.
Sclerotic focus within the right humeral head appears unchanged
since [**2157**].

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT PORT Study Date of [**2160-12-16**] 5:31 PM

No evidence of right lower extremity DVT seen.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2160-12-17**] at 10:02:37 AM
FINAL
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral segments.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-19**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with mild focal LV systolic
dysfunction. At least moderate mitral regurgitation, directed
posteriorly. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Mild to
moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Enormous biatrial dilatation.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
Ms. [**Known lastname 59218**] presents with mild to moderate oral and pharyngeal
dysphagia characterized by swallow delay and reduced epiglottic
deflection with episodes of aspiration occuring before and trace
after the swallow on thin liquids. Patient appeared very
fatigued during our evaluation and was often inc
