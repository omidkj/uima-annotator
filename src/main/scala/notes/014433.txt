resolution of ST elevations. Patient had recurrent symptoms and
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management. Underwent Left and Right
Heart Cath that showed 1VD with 80% proximal LAD stenosis and
80% hazy proximal D1 stenosis. Placement of 1 stent in D1 and 2
overlapping stents in the mid-LAD. Patient's course complicated
by V-fib arrest during 1st of 2 stents placed in mid-LAD.
Patient underwent CPR, defibrillation X 5, emergent intubation,
and transient pressor support with dopamine

Gen - thin elderly man in NAD

NECK - no JVD
CHEST - decreased BS throughout, mild exp wheezes, no rales
CV - reg rate, distant heart sounds, [**1-28**] SM
ABD - soft, NT/ND, +BS, no HSM
EXT - intact peripheral pulses, no edema


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Rate 86 Sinus rhythm. Tall peaked P waves and rightward P
wave axis. QS deflections in leads V1-V2 consistent with prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. The T waves are now biphasic
to inverted in leads V1-V3 and there are ST segment
depressions in leads II, III and aVF and variation in the left
precordial lead
placement

cardiac cath: 90%LAD stenosis s/p drug eluting stent x2, 80% D1
stenosis s/p bare metal stent x1 w/ 30% residual stenosis;
modest disease in RCA, LCx. Normal LMCA, elevated right and left
sided pressures (RV 41/18, RA mean 13, PA mean 32, PCWP
mean 19).

CXR: Severe changes of emphysema, without evidence of pneumonia
or congestive heart failure. Asymmetric pleural thickening in
the lung apices, right greater than left.

Echo: LVEF>55%, trivial mitral regurgitation, pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 70 yo with end stage COPD, still smoking, who
presents with acute anterior STEMI.

Hospital Course:
1. CAD  - taken to cath on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] where cath showed
results above.  He had DE stent and PCTA to prox LAD and D1.
Cath c/b VFib arrest.  Patient was cardioverted x5, intubated,
placed on pressors and taken to the CCU.  His cardiac enzymes
peaked around 24-36 hours after cardioversion.
He was started on ASA, plavix, lipitor, and Lisinopril.  A
Bblocker was not started given severe COPD.  His lipitor dose
was decreased to 10mg QD given his persistent elevation in CKs.
He will need to have these followed up as an outpatient to
ensure they normalize.
Given that his troponin remained <0.1 and his MBI never was
positive, it was felt that he did not have a plaque rupture but
subacute coronary stenosis.

2. COPD - end stage, on home O2 and severely limited in ADLs.
Pt only taking combivent and theodur at home.  He was extubated
without event shortly after arrival to the CCU.  His initial lab
work did not show signs of chronic CO2 retention.
Pulmonary was consulted to assist in optimization of his COPD
medication regimen.  They recommended starting tiotropium and
using atrovent for rescue therapy.  Albuterol use to be
minimized given CAD.
He was felt to be a candidate for pulmonary rehab and will f/u
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

3. CHF - noted to have PCWP of 28 with elevated PAP on Right
heart cath.  He was diuresed with good results.  No evidence of
decompensated CHF on exam.  TTE performed which showed EF 70%
with no evidence of WMA (poor windows given COPD).

4. Aspiration - initally felt to have aspiration PNA given
emergent intubation and he was started on levaquin and flagyl.
As he remained afebrile with gradually decreasing WBC, his abx
were d/c'd on HD#2.

5.  Deconditioning - given his MI and his poor pulmonary
reserve, he was evaluated by PT and OT and felt to benefit from
short term rehab.

6.  Follow up - patient has no PCP and was referred to [**Company 191**] to
establish primary care.  He will also f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
pulmonary and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] in Cardiology.
