History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 78 year-old gentleman with a distant
history of diverticulitis and a reversed Hartmann's pouch 30
years prior, who recently experienced intractable lower
gastroitestinal bleeding at [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2114-10-22**] with
subtotal colectomy with ileo-sigmoid anastomosis. This was
complicated by several episodes of bleeding per rectum about 3
weeks prior to this admission. He then underwent a total
colectomy and ileo-rectal anastomosis, which was complicated by
anastomotic leak. The anastomosis was resected and an
end-ileostomy was created on [**2024-10-29**]. At the outside hospital
he was experiencing severe abdominal pain, he began experiencing
hematochezia from his ileostomy. He demonstrated a persistent
leukocytosis and was treated with Vancomycin, Ceftazidime, and
Flagyl. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management on
[**2114-11-7**].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER he complained of moderate right-sided abdominal
pain, but denied nausea or vomiting. He denied fever or chills.

[**2114-11-8**] CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST:
High-density area with locules of gas in the rectus abdominis on
the right
just superior to the ileostomy most likely represents a
hematoma; however,
infection cannot be excluded. A leak also cannot be excluded
given the
high-density material. Small, unsuitable for drainage, fluid
collection, simple in attenuation and without a well defined
wall, abutting this rectus abdominis hyperdense area.
Superinfection not excluded. No extraluminal contrast at the
anastomotic site in the pelvis. Free air
in the abdomen may be related to postop status. Moderate
bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent relaxation
atelectasis. Ascites.

[**2114-11-21**] UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT PO:
No evidence of DVT.

[**2114-11-27**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**11-25**], the tracheostomy and
nasogastric tubes remain in place. Bilateral pleural effusions
with
compressive atelectasis, most prominent at the left base. There
is
substantial pulmonary vascular congestion. Overall, there is
little change.

Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: The patient remained intubated after his operative
procedure on [**2114-11-8**] at [**Hospital1 18**] and was maintained on Fentanyl gtt
for sedation and pain control. This was transitioned to Dilaudid
IV by HOD#23. The patient had been following some commands off
sedation and was received intermittent Ativan, Zyprexa and
clonidine for agitation.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient had a relatively stable hemodynamic
course. On [**11-13**] he experienced some episodic hypotension which
resolved with Q6 hour albumen 5% (12.5/500 mL) colloid
resuscitation. Levophed was initiated in the post-op period and
was continued until [**11-13**] and was weaned appropriately when his
pressures responded. He was transfused 1 U PRBC on [**11-13**] for the
hypotension and a tapering hematocrit. On [**11-14**] another unit of
PRBC was transfused with adequate response. Lopressor and
hydralazine were administered as needed for control of
hypertension which occurred in the following hospital days.

RESPIRATORY: The patient remained intubated following the
procedure. By [**11-13**] bilateral pleural effusions were noted with
cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. These effusion continued into
[**11-24**] but remained stable and had not progressed. A Lasix gtt
was initiated on [**11-11**] to attempt aggresive diuresis for the
effusion with some success. The Lasix gtt was discontinued on
[**11-14**]. Moreover, the patient had been on CMV and weaned to MMV on
[**11-10**]. Despite no identifiable pulmonary process other than
effusions, PSV was not tolerated initially. On [**11-18**] he was
self-extubated and subsequently re-intubated. He began
tolerating CPAP/PSV during the day with nighttime CMV by [**11-19**],
but was unable to tolerate weaning from the ventilation device.
On [**11-20**] a percutaneous tracheostomy was placed without
complication. Over the course of the next week he continued
CPAP/PSV during the day but required CMV overnight. A
bronchoscopy and BAL were sent on [**11-24**] given an increased in
tracheal and respiratory secretions which were empirically
treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn. The BAL washing demonstrated
an E.coli strain for which he was treated. By HOD#21 he had
begun tolerating longer periods of trach mask without
ventilatory support. Pt tolerated PMV trials prior to discharge.

FEN/GI: After admission the patient was brought to the operating
room on [**2114-11-8**] after several previous surgeries at an outside
hospital, most recently for an anastomotic leak. He had an
end-ileostomy created during a prior surgery. He was transferred
to our institution with an elevated white count to 20,000,
bandemia, and a necrotic-appearing stoma. A CT scan showed air
and extensive fluid in the abdomen, as well as likely intestinal
perforation, as there was significant air and fluid around the
ileum prior to insertion into the fascia. Exploratory laparotomy
and resection of the stoma and revision of stoma was performed
on [**2114-11-8**]. The ileum was clearly dead below the level of the
fascia on intra-op inspection. Unfortunately, the abdomen was
essentially frozen as well. It was not possible to isolate any
single loop of bowel without great risk of an enterotomy--it was
simply not possible to isolate any loop of bowel. It was decided
that d
