Pertinent Results:
[**2109-8-27**] Barium esophagogram:
IMPRESSION: Normal esophagogram.
.
[**2109-8-23**] Bronchial washings cytology:
Clusters of atypical epithelial cells with enlarged nuclei and
conspicuous nucleoli, favor reactive pneumocytes.
.
[**2109-8-17**] CT chest without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of multifocal consolidative and
ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs bilaterally, as
described above, consistent with progression of a multifocal
infectious process.
2. Unchanged prominent mediastinal nodes.
3. Stable small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2109-8-16**] Ankle xray:
FINDINGS: A frontal and lateral view (note that no mortise view
was
performed) of the right ankle were performed, without evidence
of fracture, effusion, or significant soft tissue abnormality.
Minimal degenerative changes seen at the talonavicular and
intertarsal joints. No significant interval change.
.
[**2109-8-16**] Lower extremity US:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT bilaterally. Small amount of
fluid in the
right medial ankle joint.
.
[**2109-8-15**] Bone marrow cytogenetics:
FISH evaluation for a PML-RARA rearrangement was performed on
nuclei with the Vysis LSI PML/RARA Dual Color, Dual Fusion
Translocation Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**]
Molecular) for PML at 15q22 and RARA at 17q21 and is interpreted
as ABNORMAL. Rearrangement was observed in 31/100 nuclei, which
exceeds the normal range (up to 1% dual rearrangement) for this
probe in our laboratory. A PML-RARA rearrangement is found in
most acute promyelocytic
leukemias (FAB M3).
.
[**2109-8-15**] BM biopsy:
DIAGNOSIS:
- HYPERCELLULAR MARROW FOR AGE WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE
HEMATOPOIESIS.
- DISORDERED MYELOID MATURATION IS PRESENT.
- NO DEFINITIVE MORPHOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA
SEEN.
.
[**2109-8-14**] sputum:
Highly atypical squamous cells, suspicious for squamous cell
carcinoma
.
[**2109-8-13**] CT head:
IMPRESSION: Resolving small left occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage,
without evidence of new hemorrhage or other acute intracranial
abnormality.
.
[**2109-8-12**] CT chest
IMPRESSION:
1. Technically suboptimal study, nevertheless, with evidence of
bilateral
pulmonary emboli including probable right main pulmonary artery
embolus as
characterized above.
2. Ongoing progression of previously described pulmonary
findings,
characterized on [**7-27**] and [**8-1**]. In light of patient's
clinical
history, these findings may represent progression of infectious
process with some possible component of infarction.
.
[**2109-8-6**] colonic biopsy to eval diarrhea: no abnormalities. CMV
immunostains performed on parts A-D are negative with
satisfactory controls.
.
[**2109-8-1**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy ground-glass opacities throughout the left upper and
left lower
lobes as well as a few areas in the right lung, differential
includes atypical infectious process versus alveolar hemorrhage;
this appearance is largely unchanged from previous study.
2. No evidence for abscess or acute infectious process.
.
[**2109-7-27**] CT chest without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval worsening of diffuse ground-glass opacities
in the left
lower lobe and right upper lobe with slight interval improvement
in the left upper lobe. While atypical infectious etiologies (ie
PCP) could have a similar appearance, given bronchoscopy
findings, this is most consistent with ongoing/recurrent diffuse
alveolar hemorrhage.
2. Interval development of multiple small nodular densities in
the bilateral lower lobes. This is not consistent with
hemorrhage, and most likely reflects a superimposed atypical
infectious process. In particular, fungal etiologies should be
considered, as well as a possibility of small septic emboli.
.
[**2109-7-26**] CT head without contrast:
IMPRESSION: Expected evolution of small left occipital
parenchymal hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage or
other acute intracranial abnormality.
.
[**2109-7-19**] CT chest without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Atypical pneumonia or hemorrhage, predominantly left lung.
2. Enlarged left paratracheal lymph node.
.
[**2109-7-15**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structur
