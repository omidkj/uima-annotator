HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  On initial presentation to the
neurology service, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55-year-old man with a
complicated past medical history who was well until [**2150-9-28**] when he was bit by a spider.  Following this, he
developed renal failure secondary to membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis.  He also had an SMA aneurysm which
ruptured and resulted in a large hematoma.  This was
subsequently clipped, but his postoperative course was
complicated by hypertension, bradycardia as well as agitation
and visual hallucinations.  He also had multiple seizures and
head turning to right, end gaze preference and he was loaded
on Dilantin.  MRI showed increased flare signals without
associated effusion restriction within the occipital lobes
and within the watershed visions of the MC and ACA and this
was through to represent either a hypertensive
leukoencephalopathy or watershed infarcts.  He was
hospitalized for nearly two months but then discharged to
[**Hospital 38**] Rehab.  The patient was admitted again on [**2151-5-25**]
after having a seizure at home.  He had complained of an
unsteady gait for at least the day prior to possibly a week
prior to this period.  On the day of admission his wife found
him lying on the couch, incontinent of stool and bleeding
from a scalp laceration.  On arrival of the EMTs he had a
witnessed seizure.  He was taken then to [**Hospital3 3583**]
where he was intubated for airway protection.  A CT scan of
the brain revealed 2 by 3 by 3 cm right cerebellar
hemorrhage.  He was then loaded on Dilantin and given one
unit FFP.  He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.  In the ICU
his course was notable for labile blood pressure and was
extubated easily.  He also had persistent nausea, vomiting.
Repeat MRI on [**5-27**] showed substantially less T2 signal
abnormality within the cerebrum and to a lesser extent within
the cerebellum.  There is an area of T2 hypointensity in the
right cerebellum consistent with hemorrhage, with a mild
degree of mass effect exerted upon the fourth ventricle which
remained midline in position.  There was also questionable
tiny minimally elevated signal within the left cerebellar
hemisphere just above an area of T2 hyperintensity.  The
patient was stabilized on the neurology service without
anymore further episodes of seizures on Dilantin and Topamax.
However, patient complained of chest pain at rest and at that
point was transferred to the medicine service for further
management and care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Glomerulonephritis with renal
failure.  2) SMA artery aneurysm status post coiling in [**1-30**].
3) Peptic ulcer disease status post endoscopy in 10/99 with
no ulcers.  4) CVA bilateral watershed infarcts left greater
than right and bilateral occipital lobe infarcts.  5)
Seizures starting in [**2151-2-26**], was on Dilantin transiently
but is currently off.  6) Renal insufficiency.  7)
Hypertension.  8) PE status post IVC filter placement.  9)
ICU delirium in [**2151-1-29**].  10) History of upper GI
bleed.  11) Status post common bile duct stent.  12) Status
post PEG.  13) Echo with EF of 20%, global hypokinesis, focal
anterior and septal apical akinesis.

mg po q day, Losartan 25 mg po q day, Metoprolol 50 mg po

day, TUMS 500 mg qid, Colace 100 mg po bid, Meclizine 12.5 mg
[**Hospital1 **], Clonidine patch.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remarried to his second wife with children.
Former marketing representative.  Polysubstance abuse over 20
years ago.  No alcohol or tobacco use recently.  Prior to
that, 20 pack year tobacco history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial admission, temperature
97.9, pulse 74, blood pressure 124/56.  In general the
patient appeared older than stated age, lying in bed in no
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclera, normocephalic,
intubated.  Neck, moderately stiff with flexion but no leg
raising or signs of discomfort, no LAD, JVD or bruits.
Lungs, vented breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular,
regular rate and rhythm, distant S1 and S2, no murmurs,
gallops or rubs.  Abdomen, normal bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, non distended.  Extremities, no cyanosis or
erythema, however, 3+ edema at ankles.  Skin, petechiae over
the left hand dorsum but none on ankle.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white blood cell count 16.2,
hematocrit 34.8, potassium 3.5, CO2 18, creatinine 1.6,
glucose 150, INR 1.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Neuro:  Upon transfer from the neurology service to the
[**Hospital6 16326**], the patient remained neurologically
intact with no further episodes of seizures.  He was
continued on Topiramate and Dilantin with Dilantin level
being monitored carefully.  Patient will continue on Dilantin
and follow-up with neurology upon discharge from the
hospital.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was transferred to the
medicine service for chest pain at rest.  The patient was
ruled out for an MI and had a cardiac catheterization which
revealed no evidence of obstructive coronary disease in this
right dominant system.  Moderate diastolic biventricular
dysfunction and no evidence of significant renal artery
stenosis.  In light of patient's diastolic dysfunction, and
radiographic evidence of pleural effusions, he was diuresed
with some improvement in his breathing status and eventually
was discontinued from supplemental oxygen.  However,
patient's pleural effusion continued to exist, likely
secondary to third spacing from hypoalbuminemia.  The
patient's blood pressure was initially very difficult to
control despite being on multiple medications, however,
eventually his blood pressure was well controlled on titrated
doses of ACE inhibitor, [**Last Name (un) **], beta blocker and Clonidine
patch.

3.  Renal:  Patient's BUN and creatinine remained stable
throughout the course of his stay on the medicine service.
He was followed by the renal team given his history of MPG in
the past.  He continued to have significant proteinuria.
Therefore, patient was continued on both [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] and ACE
inhibitor for decreasing his level of proteinuria.  Patient
will need to be followed up in the renal clinic upon
discharge from the hospital.

4.  GI:  During his course of stay on the [**Hospital1 139**] firm, the
patient developed partial small bowel obstruction.  CT of his
abdomen showed markedly dilated small bowel with contrast
passing through to the level of the splenic flexure of the
colon.  Findings consistent with partial SBO.  Patient was
seen by the surgery service and they recommended placing an
NG tube to suction.  With NG tube to suction, patient's small
bowel obstruction resolved over the course of [**1-31**] days.  The
patient's diet was slowly advanced.  CT also showed slight
interval decrease in the size of ovoid fluid collection in
the right mid abdomen consistent with patient's known
intraperitoneal hematoma from his prior admission.  [**Hospital **]
hospital course was also complicated by decrease in his
hematocrit and guaiac positive stools.  Patient's hematocrit
was stabilized with packed red blood cell transfusion.  He
remained hemodynamically stable.  At the time of this
dictation the GI service was to see patient.  In light of
patient's SBO and hemorrhagic cerebellar stroke as well as GI
bleed, patient's Coumadin was withheld.  Patient's
anticoagulation was to be resumed after GI service evaluates
patient.  Please see addendum to the this discharge summary
for further details.  During the course of this stay,
patient's biliary stent which was placed in [**1-30**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 19731**] was removed by the ERCP service.  A sphincterotomy
was performed and the bilious fluid was noted to be likely
infected. Therefore patient was continued on two weeks of
Levofloxacin for presumptive ch
