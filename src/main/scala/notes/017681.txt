Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure, acute stroke syndrome

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo male with a h/o atrial fibrillation,
dementia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenia who is transferred
from [**Hospital6 5016**] after acute onset of facial droop and
dysarthria on the morning of [**5-21**]. Per information gathered from
medical record and from family, patient awoke with slurring of
speech and right facial droop. He was immediately transferred
from the rehab facility to [**Hospital6 5016**] out of concern
for CVA. Per EMS record, patient had equal grip and strength and
denied any headache or chest pain at time of transfer.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital6 5016**] BP 121/81, HR 103-112 (afib),
T 95.3, BG 160, respirations were unlabored on 2L. He was
documented to be alert but with difficulty word finding, with
right facial droop, and slurred speech. He was able to swallow a
dose of Coreg 6.25 mg PO which was administered for rapid afib.
He subsequently received 5 mg IV lopressor for HR in the 130's.
Per family's report, he became increasingly agitated and
confused and attempted to climb out of bed. He is next
documented to have developed a 20 second period of apnea with
[**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing and inability to speak. He was reported
to be cyanotic in his lips and extremities at this time and was
intubated with Versed 4 mg, Ativan 2 mg IV, and Succ 200 mg. He
was transported via [**Location (un) 7622**] to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 97.9, BP 72/42, RR 14, SpO2 99%.
Levophed drip was started. Bedside FAST exam was performed and
LIJ sepsis catheter was placed. CT head was negative for acute
intracranial process. CT torso was negative for evidence of
occult infection. He received 4 liters NS, ceftiraxone 2 gram,
vancomycin 1 gram, Protonix 40 mg IV, Thaimine 100 mg IV, and
Decadron 10 mg IV. Neurology was consulted.

Social History:

STUDIES:
* Torso CT [**5-21**]:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
2. Mesenteric fat stranding, pericholecystic fluid, periportal
edema and small amount of ascites which may be due to low
albumin state or third spacing.
3. Bilateral hypodense lesions, some of which are too small to
characterize, others which are simple cysts.
4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.8 x
6.2 cm in widest dimension.
5. Calcifications within the head of pancreas.
.
* Head CTA [**5-21**]:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process on CT head.
2. CT perfusion shows no evidence of abnormal perfusion in the
visualized portions of the brain.
3. CTA head shows persistent trigeminal artery between the
basilar artery and the right cavernous carotid artery. Related
narrowing of the basilar artery as well as the vertebral
arteries, which feeds the PICA. No region of focal stenosis or
occlusion is seen.
4. A region of apparent narrowing of the left ICA distal to its
origin is likely artifactual due to a large amount of streak
artifacts from dental filling at this level.
.
* Brain MRI [**5-22**]:
1. Findings consistent with acute infarct in the deep white
matter of the left centrum semiovale. Findings suggest watershed
infarct which may be related to hypotensive episode.
2. MRA again shows persistent trigeminal artery with decreased
size of the basilar artery as well as the vertebral arteries
which feed the PICA. No region of focal stenosis or occlusion is
seen.
3. Tissue loss is again demonstrated in the left inferior
frontal lobe. Old ischemic changes also seen in the pons.
.
* Abd U/S [**5-22**]:
1. Gallbladder remains nondistended without evidence of stone.
Note is made of wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid which
is non-specific and may be seen in the setting of liver
dysfunction, congestive heart failure or hypoalbuminemia. Please
correlate clinically.
2. Trace perihepatic ascites.
3. Pleural effusion.
.
* EEG [**5-22**]:
This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the disorganized, low
voltage and slow background admixed with bursts of generalized
mixed frequency slowing. This constellation of findings is
consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy and suggests
dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline structures.
Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection, and hyoxia are
among the common causes of encephalopathy, but there are others.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, although
encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features. The beta activity
likely reflects medication effect. Note is made of the abnormal
cardiac tracing.
.
* Echo [**5-22**]: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and
global systolic dysfunction. Dilated right ventricle with
moderate systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Dilated thoracic aorta.
.
* Head MRI [**5-26**]:
1. New large vascular territory infarct involving left MCA
territory and superimposed on previously seen left watershed
infarct. This could be embolic or thrombolic in etiology. No
hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures is seen.
Although this is not an adequate evaluation of intracranial
vessels, the normal vascular flow voids are demonstrated.
