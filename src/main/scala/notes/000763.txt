History of Present Illness:
51 yo male with a PMH of HTN, CAD s/p cocaine related STEMI in
[**2164**] and s/p several PCI with stents who presents with recurrent
VT. Of note patient was discharged yesterday after admission for
NSTEMI and stent placed to the OM1. His hospital course was
complicated by runs of stable VT for which he was started on a
lidocaine gtt. He had an EP study with ablation and was
discharged home on coreg.  He went home and admits to drinking
alcohol.  Denies cocaine or other elicit drugs.  He developed
palpitations that was similar to what he had during his recent
hospitalization.  He thought this was his VT and called EMS. He
denies other symptoms at that time such as chest pain, SOB, LH,
n/v. EMS gave him 150mg amiodarone and he converted to a sinus
rhythm.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were 82 regular, 92/61, 16, 100%
3LNC.  He then developed further runs of VT for 20-25 mins.
Stable without vital sign changes or symptoms.  No CP, SOB, n/v,
palpitations at that time. He was given 100mg lidocaine, 150mg
amiodarone and he did not convert. He was then given etomidate
and electrically cardioverted with 200J and he converted to
sinus rhythm. At this time, he also dropped his blood pressure
to systolic 80s.  He was started on an amiodarone gtt and EP was
consulted. EP recommended switching to lidocaine gtt. He was
then sent to the CCU for further care.
.
Currently, he does not remember being shocked in the ED. He
denies chest pressure or pain, no SOB, palpitations, nausea or
vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
51 yo male with a PMH of HTN, CAD s/p cocaine related STEMI in
[**2164**] and s/p several PCI with stents who presents with recurrent
VT.
.
# Rhythm: The patient was admitted with ICD firing and Vtach on
lidocaine drip. He was briefly on phenylephrine for low BP, but
recovered quickly and was weaned. He was monitored on telemetry.
He was started on quinidine and metoprolol. Carvedilol was
discontinued. Over the next several days, his quinidine and
metoprolol doses were adjusted as he became bradycardic to 30's
with a prolonged QTc to 530. He was asymptomatic but there was a
concern for Torsades risk. Initially, he was started on
quinidine gluconate ER 468 mg, the quinidine ER dose was then
decreased to 434mg when long Qtc was noted. He was then switched
to short acting quinidine sulfate q8hours. He continued to have
episodes of bradycardia and long QTc. Metoprolol was decreased
to 25 [**Hospital1 **] with HR increasing to 50-65. His QTc then also
improved. As he had recently had bilateral groin catherizations,
additional EP studies were defered. He will need to return in
several weeks for a possible repeat ablation proceedure. He was
discharged on metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and quinidine gluconate SR 324
q8hrs.  In addition, he was discharged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-of-hearts
monitor for two weeks. He will have close EP follow up.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: s/p multiple RCA stents and recent BMS to OM1.
No active ischemia at this time.  He was maintained on asa,
plavix, bb, ace-i, statin.
