History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year-old male with no significant past
medical history who presents with exertional chest pain since
yesterday. He first noted chest discomfort while running up 2
flights of stairs 2 days ago. He developed SOB, chest discomfort
that felt like a "cramp" or a "bruise" (unable to quantify), and
had to stop to catch his breath. The chest discomfort is
mid-chest and non-radiating. Normally he can run up the steps
without difficulty. Yesterday, he developed the same symptoms
while loading up the car for a trip to [**State 3914**]. When he arrived
in [**State 3914**], he again had the same symptoms while unloading
suitcases from his car. He reports that the shortness of breath
and chest discomfort last for minutes and resolves with rest. He
had associated diaphoresis. Per his wife, he was clutching his
chest and looked "ashen". No lightheadedness, dizziness,
pre-syncopal sensation. No palpitations. He also notes pain in
his left calf since yesterday. Initially it felt like a sprained
muscle and he took 2 alleve with some relief. The pain has since
migrated to the back of his knee.
.
He travels twice per week to [**Location 8398**]for work, which is a
50 minute train ride. He has also been on 2 long plane flights
recently-- to [**State 32155**] in early [**Month (only) **] and to [**State 3908**] on [**11-24**].
No personal or family history of cancer. No history of PE.
.
Of note, the patient had one episode of similar symptoms back in
early [**Month (only) **]. He was on a vacation in [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**State 32155**]
and developed a "cramp"-like sensation associated with SOB while
carrying bags to his hotel room. At the time he attributed this
to the high altitude. Also, around [**Holiday 944**] he had an episode
of syncope. He reports that he was walking downstairs in his
house and all of a sudden he passed out and fell against the
wall. He denies any pre- or post-syncopal symptoms. No LH,
palpitations, incontinence, or post-ictal confusion. He did not
have any work-up of these events. The patient did put himself on
the treadmill around New Year's and was able to run 5 miles
without chest discomfort or SOB.
.
He did not have any further symptoms this morning. He took 325mg
of ASA x 4. The patient called his PCP who recommended that he
come to the ED. He reports he had another similar episode this
afternoon, however, while walking from his car to triage.
.
In the ED, T 97.9, BP 139/94, HR 97, RR 18, SaO2 97% on RA. EKG
revealed ST depressions in the inferolateral leads and there was
concern for unstable angina. He received metoprolol 5mg IV x 1
and 25mg PO x 1. He was also started on a heparin drip. CXR was
negative. Evaluated by cardiology fellow in the ED who
recommended admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for further evaluation. On his way
up to the floor, he had LENIs done which revealed LLE DVT. On
arrival to the floor, he has no complaints. Denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness. Denies f/c, cough
recently.
.

Studies:
[**2189-12-12**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process. Age indeterminant
right ninth rib fracture, likely chronic given morphology.
Correlate with site of pain.
.
[**2189-12-12**] LLE ultrasound: Acute deep venous thrombosis involving
the left popliteal and tibial veins.
.
[**2189-12-12**] CTA chest:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, predominantly within
the lower lobes with a classic thin "saddle embolism" across the
right and left main pulmonary arteries.
2. Likely right heart strain given large right ventricle and
leftward deviation of the intraventricular septum.
.
[**12-13**] LLE ultrasound: Interval extension of deep venous
thrombosis from the left popliteal and tibial veins to the mid
and distal left superficial femoral vein.
.
[**12-13**] TTE:  Limited study. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and overall
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The RV is not well seen. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**12-15**] LLE ultrasound: Left popliteal and the mid-to-distal
femoral vein deep venous thrombosis. The level of clot has not
changed significantly since [**2189-12-13**].
.
[**12-15**] TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year-old male with no past medical history
who presents with exertional chest pain, shortness of breath,
and L calf pain for the past 2 days.  He was found to have
bilateral pulmonary embolism and a saddle embolism on CTA along
with DVT in his left tibial/popliteal vein. He was started on
heparin gtt. An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for
right heart strain; it was a poor study. Cardiac enzym
