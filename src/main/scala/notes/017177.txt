History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 32 year old woman with ulcerative colitis on
cyclosporine who developed a headache six days ago, and now
presents today with bizarre behaviors according to her mom. The
patient is able to provide most details of the history, but
perseverates and struggles with different aspects. Her mother is
at the bedside to provide additional Hx. Last [**Name (NI) 766**] pt
developed
gradual onset of bitemporal non-throbbing headache in the
evening. They are not positional. No worse with cough or
valsalva. At the same time (she is unable to say if it was
pre-ceding or following) she became quite nauseated. Her mother
wondered if this may have been due to some sushi she had that
evening. The following morning her symptoms persisted and she
came to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation. Head CT at that time was
normal. the patient was given antiemetics with relief. She was
feeling better and did not want an LP as recommended by ED
staff.
She left AMA. She was taken off cyclosporine and given Rx for
5FU. It is unclear if this Rx was filled and she is currently
taking 5FU. There are no records that I have access to at
present
to document the patient's BP's from this visit.

Her headache has persisted throughout the week, but has not
become any worse. However today her mother noted she was acting
very strangely. She spoke softly and slowly, she was
re-arranging
cups and lighters on a table in her living room in non-sensical
ways. She seemed "spacey." Her mother decided to bring her back
to the ED. When she said this, the pt began to undress, also
quite unusual for her.

LP performed in the ED was done sitting upright and no opening
pressure was measured. CSF revealed Protein 106, Glucose 65, WBC
0, RBC 7. Her blood pressure at presentation to the ED was
140/80.

At present the pt complains of persistent, dull bitemporal
headaches. She denies any visual loss. No numbness,
paresthesias.
Difficulty producing or understanding speech. She denies urinary
incontinence or retention, no bowel incontinence. She had
paresthesias in all four limbs intermittently since starting
cyclosporine in [**Month (only) 404**]- this has been unchanged. No difficulty
with her gait. She denies feeling nauseated or vomiting
recently.
She has not had any symptoms of diarrhea or constipation.

On review of systems, the pt denied recent fever or chills.  No
night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough,
shortness of breath.  Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. No dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
Denied
rash.
