Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman
status post fall at a nursing home from her bed to the floor
transferred from outside facility with a question of a C3
fracture and questionable basilar skull fracture.  The
patient has a baseline dementia and was found down next to
her bed after being seen approximately five minutes prior
complaining of neck pain.  The patient was initially seen at
the [**Last Name (un) 4068**] Emergency Department and noted to have the above
mentioned findings on CT and was transferred for further
evaluation by the trauma team.  During her initial evaluation
and transfer the patient remained hemodynamically stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Dementia.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Degenerative joint disease.
6.  Cerebrovascular disease.
7.  History of gastrointestinal bleeds.
8.  Depression.
9.  Breast cancer.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Protonix.
2.  Imdur.
3.  Lasix.
4.  Aldactone.
5.  Paxil.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.8.  Blood
pressure 124/64.  Heart rate 88.  Respiratory rate 24.
Satting 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  The patient was
alert and in no acute distress.  HEENT examination pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light from 3 to 2 bilaterally.
Extraocular movements intact.  Tympanic membranes were clear.
Oropharynx was clear.  Cardiovascular regular rate and
rhythm.  Respiratory rate clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Chest without deformities or tenderness.  Abdomen soft,
nontender.  Pelvis stable.  Back without deformities or
tenderness.  C spine without demonstrable tenderness.  Rectal
examination heme negative.  Extremities left shoulder
contusion with small skin tear.  Neurological alert, not
oriented, moving all extremities, but not following commands.

INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  CBC white blood cell count 2.8,
hematocrit 16.8, platelets 120.  Chemistries sodium 147,
potassium 3.8, chloride 118, bicarb 15, BUN 28, creatinine
1.2, glucose 84, lactate 0.7.  Trauma portable chest x-ray
and pelvis was negative.  CT of head with contrast revealed
fluid within the sphenoid sinus potentially concerning for
occult skull base fracture without obvious fractures seen and
a small asymmetric fossa of hyperdensity in the left basal
ganglia potentially consistent with small focus of hemorrhage
versus calcification.  CT of the C spine with reconstruction
without evidence of fracture.  CT of the chest, abdomen and
pelvis was without evidence of acute injury.  TLS film was
without evidence of fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Closed head injury:  Given the findings
mentioned above on the initial head CT in the Emergency
Department the patient was admitted to the CICU for q one
hour neurological checks and neurosurgery was consulted.  The
patient was noted to be at baseline mental status and was
without change during her hospitalization.  Repeat head CT on
the [**2-20**] indicated no change in the fluid seen in
the sphenoid sinus or the potential with basal ganglia
hemorrhage, however, a small to medium size subacute subdural
hemorrhage was seen around the left frontal and temporal
regions.  The patient's mental status remained at baseline.
Given this and the stability of findings on head CT, there
was nor further need for intervention or imaging.

2.  Neck injury:  The patient was initially transferred for
the concern of a potential fracture of C3 spinous process on
initial imaging at [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital.  These findings were not
demonstrated on CT C spine with reconstruction here at the
[**Hospital1 69**].  The patient initially
complained of neck discomfort during her hospital stay.  The
patient was unable to cooperate with flexion and extension
plain films to further evaluate the stability of her cervical
spine.  After discussion with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**] regarding the
need for magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine to
further evaluate potential injuries it was determined that
given the nature of potential injuries and the limited
interventions possible the patient was to be discharged to
outpatient follow up with a soft collar.

3.  Urinary tract infection:  Urinalysis showed greater then
50 white blood cells per high powered field with many
bacteria with urine cultures growing out E-coli.
Sensitivities pending at the time of discharge.  The patient
received a three day course of Levofloxacin and remained
afebrile throughout hospitalization.

4.  Anemia:  The patient has a history of chronic
gastrointestinal bleeding and has a baseline hematocrit of
approximately 26.  Initially was noted to have a hematocrit
of 16 upon presentation to this facility upon which value of
the decision and to transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood
cells was initiated.  However, repeat laboratory draws
revealed a CBC with a hematocrit of 26, which is at the
patient's baseline.  The patient remained guaiac negative
throughout her hospital stay and hemodynamically stable.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Closed head injury.
2.  Neck strain.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Urinary tract infection.

6.  Congestive heart failure.
7.  Dementia.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Degenerative joint disease.
10.  Cerebrovascular disease.
11.  History of breast cancer.
12.  Depression.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
2.  Isosorbide mononitrate 10 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Furosemide 40 mg po q.d.
4.  Spironolactone 50 mg po q.d.
5.  Fluoxetine 20 mg po q.d.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Outpatient follow up to be arranged with
primary care physician [**Name9 (PRE) **] trauma clinic.  Outpatient
neurosurgical follow up to be arranged.
