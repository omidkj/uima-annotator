Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] was taken the operating room on [**2140-10-12**] where he
underwent left thoracotomy and multiple wedge resections for
pulmonary metastasis. He recovered in the PACU, and transferred
to the floor in stable condition.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometer
and nebulizers he titrated of supplement oxygen with oxygen
saturations of 96% room air.

Chest-tube: 2 apical with tiny persistent air leak for 24 hrs
and basilar were to low-wall suction then changed to water-seal
without leak.  The basilar tube was removed on [**2140-10-13**]. The
apical on [**2140-10-15**].

Chest films: serial chest films were done and showed stable left
small apical pneumothorax and small bilateral effusions.

Cardiac: immediately postoperative he was hypotensive (SBP 80's)
which responded to fluid challenge (SBP 90-100).  His
lisinopril, Lasix and spironolactone were held.
The Coreg 12.5 was changed to Lopressor 12.5 tid which he was
able to tolerate. The digoxin was continued.  He remained in
sinus rhythm 80-90 and BP 90-100 on this regime. On discharge he
was instructed to take Coreg 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] increase as BP
tolerates. Restart lisinopril when BP > 110.  Lasix perform
daily weights take prn for weight gain of [**4-7**] pounds.

GI: PPI and bowel regime continued

Nutrition: tolerated a regular diet

Renal: function stable with good urine output.

Pain: Bupivacaine and hydromorphone epidural was placed and
managed by the acute pain service.  While in the PACU his pain
was not well controlled and required an epidural split with
Hydromorphone PCA and Toradol.  The epidural was titrated
multiple time for good pain control.  On [**2140-10-15**] the epidural
was removed, he was restarted on MS Contin 30 increased to tid
from [**Hospital1 **] and hydromorphone 4 mg prn.  On discharge he was MS
Contin 30 [**Hospital1 **], hydromorphone and Motrin.

IV access: His Port-a-cath was accessed and de-accessed prior
discharge.

Disposition: He was discharged to home on [**2140-10-17**] with VNA.  He
will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.  He will also
contact his PCP management of his cardiac and pain medication.
