History of Present Illness:
52 year old woman with MPD/MDS, ~ 1 year s/p sibling related
allo SCT with Busulfan/Cytoxan pre-conditioning therapy
[**2167-10-27**], hx of GVH of liver [**5-/2168**] currently C1D20 of rituxan
with Nplate, she presents with left flank pain for several days
and tachypnea. On [**9-30**] she developed fevers treated with
Moxifloxicin QOD. For the past several days she has c/o
intermittent but persistent L. sided flank pain for several
days. She was seen in clinic on [**10-7**] and had a CTA chest that
showed no PE, increase in left effusion, trace right effusion,
decreased bibasilar peribronchiolar opacities with slight
increase in peripheral right upper lobe opacities and
splenomegaly with incompletely visualized wedge shaped perfusion
defect in spleen concerning for splenic infarct. She was
referred to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, triage vs: 98.2 93 142/75 18 98% 4L NC. FAST scan
negative. She underwent CT abdomen that showed severe
splenomegaly with some low attenuation geographic regions that
may suggest early splenic infarctions, Bilateral pleural
effusions, left greater than right, with increased size of the
left effusion since the examination earlier today. She was given
Cefepime, Vancomycin, Morphine, Dilaudid and zofran.
.
On the floor, she was continued on vancomycin and cefepime for
prseumed pneumonia. She undewent thoracentesis of the left
pleural effusion with removal of 80-100cc exudative fluid with
presence of fibrin clots in serosanguinous fluid and a chest
tube was placed. There was a question on follow up CXR about
chest tube position. She underwent limited chest CT following
this that demonstrated supra-diaphragmatic placement on the
chest tube. The chest tube has put out about 20cc of fluid since
placement. She was placed on a morphine PCA and ativan for
pain/anxiety control with some improvement in her symptoms. She
continues to be tachypnic to the thirties with oxygen
saturations in the low 90s on 5L face mask (mouth breather)(mid
80s on room air), using accessory muscles. She is having
increasing secretions. She triggered this morning for tachypnea
and nursing concern. Blood pressures 90s systolic on floor.
