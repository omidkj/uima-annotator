CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year-old
Portuguese speaking female who was transferred to out

continued pain.  The patient was in her usual state of health
and was found by her family about 12:00 a.m. on the 9th
sitting on the floor vomiting.  Shortly after that she
complained of chest pain that was substernal located in the
center of her chest.  She denied any shortness of breath.
She did note some dizziness earlier in the day of admission.
Of note, the patient had an episode three months ago of
vomiting as well treated with antibiotics.  She notes that at
that time it was associated with some chest discomfort that
was thought to be secondary to the vomiting.

At the outside hospital the patient had received TNK,
however, she developed recurrence of her chest pain, ST
elevations and was sent here for a cardiac catheterization.
The patient received Lasix as well at the outside hospital.

parents or siblings.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 124/68.
Heart rate 66.  Respiratory rate 18.  O2 sat 100% on 4
liters.  In general, the patient is sitting forward, vomiting
and in discomfort, speaking Portuguese only.  HEENT pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.  Neck JVD of
8 cm.  Lungs bibasilar crackles one quarter of the way up
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm.  Normal
S1 and S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen softly
distended, positive bowel sounds, nontender, guaiac negative
at outside hospital.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  2+ peripheral pulses, healing laceration over the
right medial ankle.  Neurological full strength in upper and
lower extremities.  Cranial nerves intact, moving all
extremities.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 9.4,
hematocrit 40.1, platelets 302, 85% neutrophils, 13%
lymphocytes, PT 13.8, PTT 106, INR 1.3, sodium 144, potassium
3.6, chloride 108, bicarb 25, BUN 22, creatinine 0.7 and
glucose 264.  Initial CK at our hospital was [**10-15**].  At the
outside hospital two hours prior was 404 with an MB of 54,
MBI of 13.5 and a troponin of 4.28.  Chest x-ray at the
outside hospital was read as congestive heart failure.
Electrocardiogram initial electrocardiogram at the outside
hospital showed ST elevations of 4 mm in 2, 3 and AVF, ST
depressions in 1, AVL, V2, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation of V6 and a Q in
2, 3 and AVF, normal sinus at 100.  Electrocardiogram here
showed normal sinus at a rate of 70, left axis deviation, Q
in 2, 3, AVF, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in 2, biphasic T waves in 2,
3, AVF and poor R wave progression.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  Coronary artery
disease, the patient admitted with IMI.  Transferred from an
outside hospital where she received TNK, however, continued
to have chest pain and ST elevations.  On arrival here the
patient was chest pain free.  She was continued on a nitro
and heparin drip and treated with aspirin and Lopressor.  Ace
inhibitor was also started.  The patient remained chest pain
free.  She went for cardiac catheterization on [**2188-5-8**] at
which time she was found to have a 90% lesion in her right
coronary artery, which was a dominant vessel.  A stent was
placed to the right coronary artery.  She had diffuse disease
in her left anterior descending coronary artery with a 50%
mid segment tubular lesion.  The D1 had severe diffuse
disease with serial 80% lesions, left circumflex was
nondominant with a 50% obtuse marginal one mid segment
lesion.  The patient did well post catheterization.  She was
treated with Plavix.  Nitro and heparin were weaned off.
Lopressor and Captopril were titrated up to a dose of
Lopressor 37.5 t.i.d. and Captopril 37.5 t.i.d. at the time
of discharge.  These should be continued to be titrated up
for blood pressure less then 140 and then converted to q.d.
dosing at rehab.

The patient was also started on Lipitor 10 and lipids should
be followed up as well as liver function tests.  Her
cholesterol was note to be 192 with an LDL of 130 and an HDL
of 37.  The patient's CKs initially were 1016 with an MBI of
18.2 and troponin greater then ASA.  Her second was her peak
at 1450 with an MBI of 17 and then her CKs trended downwards.
The patient did not have any recurrent chest pain or
congestive heart failure.  Of note in the Emergency Room the
patient had a run of ventricular tachycardia that was self
limiting and did not recur during her hospital stay.
Electrolytes were aggressively repleted.  The patient was
monitored on telemetry and had no further arrhythmias.

The patient had an echocardiogram on [**5-12**] that showed an EF
of 50 to 55%, moderately dilated LA, mild left ventricular
depression, inferior hypokinesis, mildly thickened aortic
valve and 1+ MR.

2.  Infectious disease:  The patient had low grade
temperatures during her hospital stay.  Her urinalysis showed
coag negative staph as well as Gardnerella vaginalis.  She
was started on Levofloxacin 250 q.d. on the 11th and started
on Flagyl 500 b.i.d. on the 12th.  These should each be
continued for one week.  Her chest x-ray prior to discharge
also showed bibasilar atelectasis versus pneumonia.  She
should continue Levo, Flagyl for treatment of possible
pneumonia as well.

3.  Endocrine:  The patient has diabetes mellitus.  She was
treated with finger sticks q.i.d. and regular insulin sliding
scale while in house.  She is on Glucotrol at home and this
should be resumed at rehab.

4.  Physical therapy:  The patient was seen by physical
therapy and recommended for short term rehab.  The patient
will be discharged to rehab and then to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post inferior myocardial infarction.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Plavix 75 mg po q.d. until [**2188-6-8**],
aspirin 325 po q.d., Protonix 40 po q.d., Lipitor 10 mg po
q.d., Levofloxacin 250 po q.d. until [**5-17**], Flagyl 500 po
b.i.d. until [**5-18**], Lopressor 37.5 po t.i.d., Captopril 37.5
po t.i.d. and Glucotrol 5 mg po q.d. and insulin sliding
scale.  Please note Lopresor and Captopril should be titrated
up for a goal blood pressure less then 140, and heart rate in
the 60s to 70s.  This should then be converted to a q.d.
dosing of beta blocker and ace inhibitor prior to discharge
home.  The patient will follow up with cardiologist as well
as her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41503**].
