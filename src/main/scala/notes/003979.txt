History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 30016**] is a 77 year old female with a h/o moderate aortic
stenosis (valve area 1cm on echo in [**2188**]), HTN, LVH who presents
with a few weeks of worsening dyspnea on exertion. She reports
shortness of breath and feeling as though her throat is closing
with any amount of activity, about 25 steps, which resolves with
rest. She has also had a wet, nonproductive cough that is worse
with deep breathing. She denies any orthopnea, LE edema, recent
illnesses. She reports the throat tightness being present for
past few years, always with exertion and relieved by rest and
drinking ice water. She also has been having intermittent jaw
pain, usually associated with the throat tightness, never occurs
at rest. She denies any associated chest pain, but has been very
bothered by her "wet", nonproductive cough which only occurs
when she takes a deep breath, which she says is a change from
prior.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.8, 115, 131/73, 20, 95% on RA.

Labs and imaging significant for a troponin of 0.02, BNP of
3456, D-dimer of 438, EKG was sinus tachycardia with a LBBB,
with no priors for comparison. Cardiology was consulted who felt
that she was in heart failure likely due to worsening of her AS
but could also be ischemic, her symptoms of throat tightening
were concerning for angina given that it resolves with rest. The
cardiology fellow felt that her LBBB was likely related to a
structural problem, so no need for anti-coagulation at this
time. Patient was given aspirin 325 mg. Vitals on transfer were
109, 103/86, 18, 93% on RA.
.
On arrival to the floor her initial VS were: 98.6, 110/66, 109,
20, 95% on RA, patient currently feels well, says that she only
has trouble breathing when she moves around or is coughing for a
long period of time. Also, she is concerned about what she
thinks is a fungal infection in her groin area, which she has
had in the past and is currently somewhat painful.

Carotid U/S: Bilateral calcified plaque slightly greater on the
right, but no hemodynamically significant stenosis identified.
.
CXR [**1-29**]: Bilateral small pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis,
unchanged. Background emphysema.
.
Cath [**2-2**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed moderate LMCA and
multivessel
coronary artery disease. The LMCA is heavily calcified with
40-50% stenosis.  The LAD is heavily calcified with mid vessel
40-50% stenosis (relative to calcium shell).  There is a distal
short myocardial bridge with systolic compression.  There is
mild-moderate diffuse disease apically, a modest D1 and larger
D2.  The LCx is heavily calcified. There is a tiny OM1 and OM2.
There is proximal-mid tubular ulcerated eccentric 70% stenosis
before OM3.  OM3 has a large lower pole with hazy 85%stenosis.
There is a modest OM4 and OM5.  OM6/LPL1 has proximal 80%
stenosis.  There is a small LPL2, patent LPDA and distal AV
groove Cx. The RCA is heavily calcified.  It is a small,
nondominant vessel which is mildly moderately diffusely
diseased.  It supplies conus and atrial branches.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling pressures with RVEDP 9 mmHg and LVEDP 21 mmHg.  There is
mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 38 mmHg.  The
PCWP is moderately elevated at entry at 18 mmHg.  The cardiac
output is minimally depressed with CI 2.46 L/min/m2 (using an
assumed oxygen consumption).  There was severe aortic stenosis
with a mean gradient of 36 mmHg and a calculated valve area of
0.7 cm2.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate LMCA and multivessel coronary artery disease in a
left dominant system.
2. Severe aortic stenosis
3. Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure in setting
of newly diagnosed systolic heart failure.
4 .Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
5. Vagal reaction to attempts at right antecubital venous
access.
.
CT chest:
1. Thoracic aortic calcifications as described. Severe coronary
calcifications. Severe aortic valvular calcifications.
2. 5-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. In the absence of risk
factors, a 12-month followup chest CT is warranted. However if
risk factors are present then a six-month followup is warranted.

3. Left thyroid nodule, for which an ultrasound could be
performed.
4. Incompletely evaluated left adrenal lesion and incompletely
evaluated right liver lesion. These could be further evaluated
with CT or MRI.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
6. Biapical mild centrilobular emphysema.
Conclusions
Prebypass
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with borderline normal function of the
inferior and anterior walls, severe hypokinesis of the inferior
and anterior septal and septal walls, dyskinesis of the
anterior, apical septum and apical akinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severe
