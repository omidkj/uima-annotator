[**2198-5-16**] Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
49 year old gentleman who has been followed for mitral
regurgitation since [**2191-3-6**].  He has severe hypertension
that resulted in left ventricular dilatation and mitral
regurgitation. Over the course of six years, the mitral
regurgitation has worsened (left ventricular ejection fraction
has not changed from 30%) despite attempts to gain control over
his systemic blood pressure. Follow up echocardiograms revealed
severe mitral regurgitation with similiar left ventricular
function and a severely dilated left ventricle.  He continues to
be relatively asymptomatic of his mitral disease. He has seen Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for an operation and is here today for a catheterization
before proceeding.

Pertinent Results:
[**2198-5-16**] Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated angiographically apparent
flow-limiting coronary artery. The LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA had
no angiographically significant disease. 2.  Resting
hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left- and right-sided
filling pressures with a mean PCWP of 16 mmHg and an RVEDP of 14
mmHg. Pulmonary arterial pressures were mildly elevated at 35/27
mmHg. Cardiac output was significantly decreased at 2.4 L/min
with an index of 1.3 L/min/m2.

[**2198-5-17**] TEE: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated.
Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is present in the
left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility.
5. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are elongated. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. There is bilateral leaflet restriction.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
dilatation of the annulus, which measures 5.1 cm
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. The
tricuspid annulus is enlarged and measures 4.2 cm.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusions of milrinone, norepinephrine, amiodarone.
AV pacing ,then apacing for slow JR. [**Name (NI) **]-seated annuloplasty
rings in the mitral and tricuspid positions. Trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
No gradient across mitral or tricuspid valves with CO= 7 L/min.
LVEF is now 35% on inotropic support. Normal RV systolic
function on inotropic support. AI remains trace. Aortic contour
is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2198-5-17**] where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve Repair, Tricuspid Valve
annuloplasty and full Maze procedure. Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support. He was found to be in
junctional escape rhythm and EP was consulted. Beta blocker was
held initially and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight. He was started on IV Nitro for hypertension
and oral agents were titrated. Anti-coagulation was resumed with
Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication. The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility. He was planned for discharge on post-op
day nine but spiked a temperature. Incision was clean without
erythema or drainage. Blood cultures and U/A were negative. In
addition he developed abdominal discomfort with elevated LFT's.
Transplant Surgery was consulted and the underwent multiple
imaging studies which were all negative.  LFTs were normalizing
by the time of discharge.
He did develop some runs of ventricular tachycardia.  He
remained hemodynamically stable.  EP evaluated the patient and
recommendations were made.
Ultrasound was performed on the RLE for tenderness and swelling
that would return negative for DVT.  By the time of discharge
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was
discharged home with VNA in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions. [**Company 191**] anti-coagulation to continue
managing Coumadin/INR.
