Imaging:
CTA Head [**6-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage as described above with a
multilobulated left ICA terminus aneurysm measuring
approximately 4 x 6 mm as the presumed source. Traditional
angiography pending.

Cardiac Echo [**6-4**]:
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20--25%). There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of mid-to-apical myocardioum.
Basal and Apex areas are spared. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The left atrium is normal in
size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal.
IMPRESSION: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF
20-25 %) with regionality; akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with
sparing of the apex. Right ventricular systolic function and
size is normal. Moderate to severe (3+) tricuspid regurgitation.


CT C-spine [**6-4**]:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. No acute traumatic injury seen in the cervical spine.
2. Blood in the basal cisterns tracking inferiorly and
anteriorly along the brainstem and upper spinal cord. Thecal sac
contents are not adequately assessed on the present study. MR
can be considered if there is concern based on neurological
examination.
3. Airspace consolidation in the posterior lung apices with
smooth septal
thickening. Findings along with chest radiograph likely
represents some
pulmonary edema, although aspiration cannot be excluded.

CT Head [**6-5**]:
FINDINGS: The diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage appears stable in
extent.
Overall, ventricular size has further decreased, compared to the
prior study. The ventriculostomy catheter terminating in the
region of the third ventricle remains present. There has been
further interval progression of bilateral regions of
hypoattenuation involving the medial inferior frontal lobes.
There is no associated parenchymal hemorrhage. There is no shift
of normally midline structures. The streak artifact produced by
left distal internal carotid artery coils obscures evaluation in
area. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. Trace
intraventricular hemorrhage layering posteriorly in the
occipital horns as well as small amount in the third ventricle
are stable. The mastoid air cells and imaged paranasal sinuses
remain well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease in ventricular size, compared to the prior
study.
2. Further evolution of bifrontal hypoattenuation, which may
represent
infarcts rather than non-hemorrhagic contusion, given the
progression. No
parenchymal hemorrhage. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] head can be considered, if
necessary to
assess extent and vessels as recommended earlier.
3. Stable extent of diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.

CXR [**2165-6-5**]
Final Report
INDICATION: 52-year-old female with subarachnoid hemorrhage,
dilated
cardiomyopathy. Evaluate for pulmonary edema.

Single AP chest radiographs compared to 13 hours prior shows no
change. ET
tube tip is 2.3 cm above the carina. Left internal jugular
central venous
catheter terminates in the mid SVC. The NG tube tip is in the
stomach, the
sidehole slightly below the gastroesophageal junction. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Again seen are bilateral
perihilar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema, not
significantly changed from prior exam. There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Compared to prior exam from [**2165-6-5**], there is
no change in the extent of pulmonary edema.



Cardiac Echo : [**2165-6-11**]
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %). with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. with focal hypokinesis of the
apical free wall. There is no mass/thrombus in the right
ventricle. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2165-6-4**], left ventricular systolic function has improved.
Akinesis of mid-to-apical walls with sparing of the apex has
resolved.

Final Report
PORTABLE CHEST [**2165-6-19**]:

COMPARISON: Study of earlier the same date.

INDICATION: Feeding tube assessment.

FINDINGS: Feeding tube tip is directed cephalad in region of
gastroduodenal
junction. Appearance of the chest is similar to the recent
radiograph of
about 2 hours earlier except for minimal improved aeration in
the left
retrocardiac region.

[**2165-6-25**] 12:25 PM CT
HEAD CT: Axial imaging was performed through the brain without
IV contrast
administration.

COMPARISON: CT head [**2165-6-23**].

FINDINGS: There is a tract of hypodensity extending along the
course of the prior right frontal approach ventriculostomy
catheter (2:13). There is no hyperdensity along this tract to
suggest the presence of hemorrhage. The ventricles are unchanged
in size and configuration. There is streak artifact from a left
ICA aneurysm coil. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains
well preserved. There is no evidence of prior subarachnoid
hemorrhage. There is no shift of normally midline structures.
There is hypodensity in the territory of the left MCA related to
prior infarct (2:15), which appear stable without evidence for
hemorrhagic transformation. There
