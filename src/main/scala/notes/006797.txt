Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was found to be hyperglycemic with an anion gap
acidosis, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypertension of
250/100. She was given insulin drip and fluids with electrolyte
repletion  to treat her suspected DKA and was given both IV
lopressor and labaetolol to treat her hypertension.  Once
patient came to the floor it was noted that her creatinine was
improving, her metabolic acidosis was correcting, and her blood
pressure was down to 178/79.  For her gap metabolic acidosis,
insulin drip was continued with fluid and electrolyte
replacement.  For her hypertension she was placed on a
labaetolol drip but within 24 hours was maintained on po
atenolol alone.  She was continued on IV fluids and insulin
drip.  In terms of her acute on chronic renal failure, this was
likely prerenal (FENA 0.6)and quickly corrected to baseline with
fluid replacement.  Her Angiotensin Receptor Blocker was held
throughout the hospitalization secondary to this bump in
creatinine.  On the day of admission patient suffered from
severe nausea requiring zofran and phenergan for control.  As
she had a history significant for SBO, a KUB was performed but
showed no obstruction.  As DKA was considered to be a possible
reason for her gap metabolic acidosis, she was ruled out for MI.
