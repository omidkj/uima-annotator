Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, chest pain

Pericardiocentesis
EGD with biopsy


History of Present Illness:
41 y/o M w/ h/o HIV/AIDS (HIV dx 83, AIDS 92, last CD4 132, VL
>100K [**10/2203**], RF IVDU), not currently on HAART, previous right
sided bacterial endocarditis with residual 4+ TR, h/o prior MI
in [**2193**], who presents from [**Hospital **] Hospital for emergent
evaluation of pericardial tamponade.

Patient was recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] for osteomyelitis of
his L-ankle s/p prior fall. Presented to ED with fevers and
ankle pain. Taken to OR by ortho and found to have neg
brefringent crystals c/w gout. Tissue/Bone cultures grew MSSA.
Patient started on cefazolin. F/U MRI could not rule out
osteomyelitis and the patient was discharged to [**Hospital **]
hospital for 6 weeks of IV cefazolin (to end [**2203-12-5**]).

While at [**Hospital1 **], patient had uneventful course until night
prior to admission when he developed low grade temp to 100.2.
The morning of admission patient felt short of breath, lethargic
with some chest pain. Noted to be tachycardic by vitals, and
with decreased O2 sat to 90% on RA -> 96% 2L NC. Chest CT
performed showing massively enlarged cardiac silhouette.
Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent pericardiocentesis.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

In the ED, T98.8, HR 122, BP 147/87, RR 19, O2 97%. Patient
noted to be uncomfortable, and w/ rub on exam. Pulsus not
performed. Otherwise exam unremarkable. Transferred to cath lab
for emergent peridcardiocentesis.

In cath lab, pericardial pressure 35, RA and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**] each
30, RV systolic 55. 1.2 L of sanguinous fluid drained from the
pericardium. Pericardial pressure decreased to 5mm Hg, and RA to
18mm Hg s/p drain. Patient admitted to CCU for further
management.

Pericardial fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Pre-pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is >20 mmHg. The
left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated. There is a large circumferential
pericardial effusion. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w some organization. There is left atrial
diastolic collapse. There is right ventricular diastolic
collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology. There is significant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, consistent with
impaired ventricular filling.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-10-20**],
large pericardial effusion with echocardiographic signs of
tamponade is new.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-3**]) Post pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity
is markedly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is partial flail of a tricuspid valve leaflet. The tricuspid
valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-11-3**],
the residue pericardial effusion is minimal.

Cardiac catherization ([**2203-11-3**]):
1. Large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade
physiology.
2. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500mls of
blood
stained fluid. Patient left cathlab in stable condition
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe pericardial tamponade.
2. Mild primary pulmonary hypertension.
3. Successful pericardiocentesis with drainage of 1500ml of
blood
stained fluid.
.
ECHO ([**2203-11-4**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and
tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<1
