Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Admit for carotid angiography and possible intervention.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P stenting of left carotid artery


History of Present Illness:
64 year-old woman, patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with an extensive history of CAD,
now s/p recent left upper lobectomy for lung cancer with an
incidental finding of an old CVA on head CT postoperatively
prompting a workup that revealed 90% left internal carotid
stenosis on duplex, vs 55% on CTA of neck, now referred for left
carotid angiography to more clearly define her carotid anatomy,
and carotid intervention, if appropriate. Events were as
follows:
[**2128-9-28**] IMI - Treated with stenting of the RCA and LCx. Found
to have severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**] and was referred for
surgical repair.
[**2128-10-27**] Mitral valve surgery aborted after TEE at time of
surgery revealed largely normal mitral valve with improvement of
inferior hypokinesis compared to month prior.
[**3-/2129**] Cardiac Catheterization - Total occlusion of RCA stent and
patent LCX stent, mild to mod MR
[**7-/2129**] Pulmonary edema requiring intubation at an OSH. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a cardiac cath revealing T.O RCA and 40% CX
stenosis in prior stent. EF of 30%
[**2129**] AICD placement
[**2135-10-24**] Cath d/t worsening chronic angina and DOE and inferior
ischemia on dobutamine viability study. Angiography revealed 40%

LAD, 40% LCX ISRS, RCA totally occluded with distal filling via
left to right collaterals. S/P Unsuccesful recanalization of the
RCA. FFR of CX lesion demonstrated it to be a hemodynamically
insignificant lesion.
[**2136-2-2**] s/p VATS, left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection d/t adenocarcinoma. Patient d/c'd on [**2-8**] and
readmitted on [**2-13**] d/t mental status changes and hypotension. A
chest CT was done which was negative for a PE. A CT of the head
was done revealing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, but a
hypodensity at the right temporo-occipital junction. This could
represent a late subacute to chronic infarct vs metastatic
disease. A CT with contrast was done the following day revealing
the same findings. A carotid series was therefore ordered and
done on [**2136-2-15**]. This revealed an 80-99% stenosis of the left
internal carotid artery and a <40% stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery. A TTE was done on [**2136-2-15**]. This
revealed an ef of 40% with 1+MR, small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric LVH. Hypokinesis noted in
the infero-septum, inferior and infero-lateral walls. Akinesis
noted in the basal infero-septum and inferior wall.
.
The patient was subsequently referred to see Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
as an outpatient who has recommended her for carotid angiography
and intervention. The patient was then seen in clinic by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurology who is in agreement that the head
CT scan abnormality is very likely an embolic stroke and feels
that left carotid intervention is appropriate. The patient was
also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of neurosurgery who felt that
it is exceedingly unlikely that the lesion on CT scan represents
a malignancy vs. metastasis and cleared her to undergo a carotid
procedure. He recommended repeat head CT in 3 months.
.
Follow up studies have included:
[**2136-2-23**] Chest XRAY: Normal post left upper lobectomy appearance.
No evidence of any cardiopulmonary process.
[**2136-3-8**] CTA of neck: approximately 55% left sided carotid
stenosis at the bifurcation
[**2136-3-20**] CT of brain with and without contrast: No change of
right posterior temporal-occipital region, likely represents a
chronic infarct. Noted to have tortuous basilar artery. Basilary
artery summit positioned to the left of the midline. Just
anterior to the summit is a 2-mm area of contrast
enhancement--Finding could represent very tortuous origin of
left posterior cerebral artery or contigious tiny aneurysm.
.
In terms of symptoms, the patient denies any neurological
deficits, confusion,or lightheadedness. She further denies any
chest pain. She does report having dyspnea after climbing one
flight of stairs.
.
On day of admission, she underwent carotid angiography with
stent placement

Cardiac Cath COMMENTS:
  1. Access was retrograde via the RCFA with catheter placemnt
to the
aortic arch and bilateral common carotid arteries.
  2. The aortic arch was a Type I arch with mild tortuosity of
the great
vessels and no angiographically significant lesions.
  3. The right CCA was angiographically normal.  The [**Country **] had a
mild 30%
lesion at the bifurcation.  The [**Country **] filled the ipsilateral ACA
and MCA
without cross-filling.  There was mild tortuosity of the
proximal
intracerebral vessels.
  4. The left CCA was angiographically normal.  The [**Doctor First Name 3098**] had a
calcified
eccentric 90% lesion at the bifurcation and filled the
ipsilateral ACA
and MCA.
  5. Successful stenting of the [**Doctor First Name 3098**] with a [**5-10**] x 30 mm Acculink
stent
(see PTA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe left internal carotid artery stenosis.
2. Successful stenting of the left internal carotid artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 year-old woman with question of significant carotid
stenosis, referred for carotid angiography.
.
PLAN:
.
# S/P Carotid Angiography with stent placement:  She had left
ICA stent placed on day of admission without event.  Developed
reflex hypotension and was placed on a low dose of
Neo-synephrine.  This was weaned and by HD #1, her BP was
elevated and we resumed Carvedilol and ACE/Lasix at home doses
which were well tolerated.  We continued continue ASA, Statin,
Plavix throughout admission.  Her mental status remained
unchanged and her neuro exam was without focal defecits.  She
did report occasional headache which responded well to PO meds.
She was discharged to home on HD #2 without event.
