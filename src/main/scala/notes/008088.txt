Admission Date:  [**2170-12-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2170-12-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2118-4-15**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Gynecology

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Ascites.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Ascites, status post total abdominal
hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, peritoneal
washings.

HISTORY:  The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history
of mild asthma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obstructive
sleep apnea, and chronic pain who presents with new onset of
ascites and elevated CA125 level.  Her evaluation in the
outpatient setting included a CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis which confirmed a large intraperitoneal ascites
without other abnormalities.  The course and progression of
the patient's ascites development was concerning for ovarian
cancer.  For this the patient was referred to gynecological
oncology.  For further evaluation and treatment of patient's
condition, an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was
recommended.  The patient consented to this treatment plan.

When the patient presented on [**2170-12-20**] to the preoperative
holding area, she complained of mild shortness of breath.
She had recently been treated with antibiotics for a presumed
upper respiratory tract infection and had continued her
outpatient asthma care.  The preoperative assessment was a
mild asthmatic exacerbation.  Though more aggressive care
would be necessary to optimize the patient's pulmonary status
intraoperatively and postoperatively, postponement of the
surgery was not considered as the optimal treatment of the
patient's acute condition of ascites requiring more immediate
diagnosis and intervention given the high suspicion for
ovarian cancer.

The patient underwent an uncomplicated total abdominal
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy,
and peritoneal washing on [**2170-12-20**].  The estimated blood loss
was 150 cc.  The findings included the following:  Large
ascites, normal upper abdominal survey, normal omentum,
normal bowel, normal uterus, tubes and ovaries, no peritoneal
seedings, no palpable lymphadenopathy.  The details of this
operative procedure are provided in the dictated operative
note.

Immediately postoperatively extubation was not successful due
to significant tachypnea in the setting of the patient's
underlying pulmonary disease.  Extubation was a completed
successfully later that evening.  The patient was admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit overnight for observation and
management of her pulmonary condition.  She was treated with
Albuterol nebulizer treatments on a regular basis and started
on high dose steroids.  The patient responded well to that
therapy and by postoperative day #1 she was breathing
comfortably on 3 liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.  The
patient continued to do well from a coronary standpoint.  She
was discharged on a Prednisone taper and continuation of her
outpatient Advair and Combivent therapy.

The patient's pain management was also closely attended to
during her hospitalization.  As an outpatient she was managed
with 60 mg of OxyContin tid for her chronic pain condition.
Once the patient was tolerating an oral diet and intravenous
narcotics were discontinued, the OxyContin was restarted with
Dilaudid provided as breakthrough.  Non steroidal
anti-inflammatories and Acetaminophen were continued as well.
This regimen successfully controlled the patient's pain and
she was discharged on this regimen.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5166**] in
[**5-29**] days for a wound check and staple removal.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient's outpatient regimen was
continued.  Additionally she was provided with Dilaudid and
Motrin.
