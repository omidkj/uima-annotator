CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2205-8-12**] 7:57 PM

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized portion of
the lung bases demonstrates severe centrilobular emphysematous
changes of the lung. No parenchymal opacification or pulmonary
nodule is seen. The left atrium is mildly enlarged.

The liver, gallbladder, intra and extrahepatic bile ducts,
spleen, pancreas, stomach, duodenum and loops of small bowel are
unremarkable. Colonic pandiverticulosis is noted. Both kidneys
contain multiple hypodense lesions which are too small to
characterize. No free air or fluid is noted within the abdomen.
The patient is status post mesh placement of anterior abdominal
wall. No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric
nodes are noted.

The thoracic aorta demonstrates mural thrombus and aneurysmal
dilatation
measuring 3.9 x 4.4 cm which extends for 7.1 cm and extends into
the
suprarenal aorta. The patient is status post aorto- biliac
bypass grafting. Complete opacification of the both external
iliac arteries are noted. Severe stenosis is noted at the origin
of the right common iliac artery. The abdominal aorta
demonstrates severe calcification with calcification noted at
the origin of celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery and both
renal arteries.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder contains
small locules of air most likely related to the prior Foley
catheter placement. The rectum contains impacted stool. The
sigmoid colon contains multiple diverticula. No evidence of
diverticulitis is seen. Left-sided rectus sheath hematoma is
noted which measure 4.3 x 5.9 in transverse diameter and
measures 10.9 cm in craniocaudal diameter. In the right inguinal
region a fluid density material is surrounding the right common
femoral artery consistent with the patient history of recent
thrombectomy on the right inguinal region. Right indirect
inguinal hernia is noted which contains fluid. No evidence of
bowel obstruction or incarceration is noted. No free air or
fluid is noted within the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged
pelvic or inguinal nodes are detected.

BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are
noted. Degenerative changes of lower lumbar spine are
identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. Relatively large rectus sheath hematoma which extends into
the left inguinal region measuring 4.3 x 5.9 x 10.9 cm. No
evidence of bowel entrapment within the inguinal canals were
noted.

2. Small fluid containing right-sided inguinal hernia was noted.

3. Status post aorto-biiliac bypass garfting.

4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3.9 x 4.4 cm in
transverse diameter which extends 7.2 cm in craniocaudal
diameter.

5. Status post thrombectomy at the right inguinal region with a
small amount of fluid tracking along the common femoral artery.

6. Stool impaction is noted within the rectum.

7. Small right-sided pleural effusion is seen. Emphysematous
changes of lung bases are noted.

8. Colonic pandiverticulosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2205-8-7**] The patient was brought to [**Hospital3 4527**] and was
started on heparin and emergentlytransferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient with
