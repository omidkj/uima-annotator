Service:  ACOVE Medicine Service

ADDENDUM:  The patient is a 62-year-old female.  This will
serve as an Addendum to the Discharge Summary that was
previously dictated.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course did not change significantly
for her metastatic pancreatic cancer.  The patient's case was
discussed with her primary oncologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 150**])
who felt that given the patient's poor functional status and
extremely grim prognosis that the patient was likely not a
candidate for palliative chemotherapy.

For hypoxic respiratory failure, the patient continued on a
50% face mask.  Her oxygen saturations ranged from 94% to
98%.  The patient was also maintained on vancomycin, Zosyn,
and Flagyl until she completed a 14-day course; which she
completed prior to discharge.  Otherwise, the patient had no
further episodes of desaturations and no further admissions
to the  Medical Intensive Care Unit for hypoxic acute
respiratory compromise.

For diastolic congestive heart failure, the patient's goals
were to maintain even input and output.  She was started on a
beta blocker at 12.5 mg twice per day for tachycardia.  The
patient's tachycardia was felt likely secondary to pain;
although, in the setting of a deep venous thrombosis a
pulmonary embolism could not be ruled out.

For deep venous thrombosis, the patient had lower extremity
Doppler studies given that she had asymmetric lower extremity
edema which were significant for bilateral deep venous
thrombosis extending from the femorals to the popliteals
bilaterally.  The patient was started on heparin and
Coumadin.  Her INR was not therapeutic at the time of
discharge and was 1.4.  The patient was to be continued on
heparin drip at 1100 units per hour as well as Coumadin until
her INR is greater than 2.  This was to be continued at
[**Hospital1 **].

For pain, the patient was maintained on a Fentanyl patch
which was increased to 125 mcg q.72h.   Her MS04 intravenous
was discontinued, and the patient was continued on morphine
sulfate immediate release at 30 mg one by mouth q.6h. with
good pain control.

For fluids/electrolytes/nutrition, the patient was continued
on total parenteral nutrition and full liquids.  Her diet
should be advanced at [**Hospital1 **] as tolerated.  The patient's
total parenteral nutrition orders will be sent with the
patient's discharge paperwork.

For prophylaxis, the patient was maintained on heparin, and
Coumadin, proton pump inhibitor, and a bowel regimen.  She
was also ambulated from bed to chair.

For decubitus ulceration, the patient developed a decubitus
ulceration to which Duoderm was applied and remained stable
during her hospitalization.

The patient's code status was full.

For hematologic issues, the patient's hematocrit levels
remained stable throughout her hospitalization.  It should be
noted that the patient has a transfusion reaction to blood
and should be given Benadryl prior all blood transfusions.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Metastatic pancreatic cancer.
2.  Bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
3.  Respiratory failure.
4.  Status post nephrostomy.
5.  Diastolic congestive heart failure.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient should have a follow-up appointment with her
primary care physician within two weeks of discharge.
2.  The patient should have her electrolytes and complete
blood count checked regularly as she needed transfusions and
will be on total parenteral nutrition.
3.  The patient's INR level should also be checked to insure
that she is therapeutically anticoagulated.
4.  The patient's diet should be advanced as tolerated so
that she can get off total parenteral nutrition if at all
possible.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was fair.   She was stable on 50% face mask without
desaturations.  She was tolerating total parenteral nutrition
and full liquids.  She was able to ambulate from bed to
chair.  Her blood counts have remained stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was to be discharged to
[**Hospital6 310**] for physical as well as
pulmonary rehabilitation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient's medications on
discharge included)
 1.  Ipratropium nebulizers 1 q.6h. as needed.
 2.  Albuterol nebulizers 1 q.4h. as needed.
 3.  Albuterol nebulizers 1 q.4h. as needed.
 4.  Methylphenidate 5 mg one by mouth in the morning.
 5.  Morphine sulfate 30 mg one by mouth q.6h. as needed (for
pain).
 6.  Pantoprazole 40 mg one by mouth once per day.
 7.  Metoprolol 12.5 mg one by mouth twice per day (to be
advanced as tolerated).
 8.  Senna 8.5-mg tablets one tablet by mouth twice per day
as needed.
 9.  Bisacodyl 5-mg tablets two tablets by mouth once per day
as needed.
10.  Docusate 100 mg one by mouth twice per day as needed.
11.  Coumadin 5 mg one by mouth at hour of sleep (to be
adjusted based on INR).
12.  Lorazepam 0.5-mg tablets one tablet by mouth q.4-6h. as
needed (for anxiety).
13.  Fentanyl patch 125-mcg transdermal patch q.72h. (to be
