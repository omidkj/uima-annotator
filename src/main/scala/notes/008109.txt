59yoF with h/o DM but not on medications, hypothyroidism,
Hyperlipidemia Coronary Artery Disease, and Hypertension
presented to OSH with Altered Mental Status and seizure found to
have HHS and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Per
the patient's daughter over the last few months the patient has
lost a lot of weight, not been able to go 5 mins without using
the bathroom, and has felt fatigued. she was started on a new
thyroid medication in the last few weeks. She was supposed to
see the doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 20212**] but postponed to today. However,
last night she was "not herself" but she said she was fine. This
morning her daughter still thought she was altered but the
patient insisted that she go to work this afternoon at 2pm.  at
6:30 a police officer drove the patient home and reported that
she had driven her car into a pole, was confused but had refused
to go to the hospital. Then the patient went to her room and
fell asleep, while her dtr went to get the car (about 1 hour).
After this the daughter insisted they go to the hospital. On the
car ride she began losing consciousness and as they arrived to
the hospital had a seizure. (documented as GTC by OSH). REceived
ativan and dilantin. Head CT normal.

at OSH labs notable for glucose in 1400s and Na 139. ABG 7.19.
Then reportedly became apneic and was intubated at [**Hospital1 **]. Given
SC insulin and insulin gtt at 6 units /hr. Got 4L NS at OSH.

Imaging:
Lower ext dopplers [**2117-2-17**]
FINDINGS: Waveforms in the common femoral veins are symmetric
bilaterally with appropriate response to Valsalva maneuvers. In
the right lower extremity, the common femoral, proximal and mid
superficial femoral veins as well as proximal greater saphenous
are all normal with appropriate compressibility, and
wall-to-wall flow on color analysis. There is
non-compressibility of the distal portion of the superficial
femoral vein as well as of the popliteal vein, with absent flow
on color Doppler analysis, related to deep venous thrombosis in
those locations. Wall-to-wall flow and compressibility is noted
in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins in the right calf.
.
In the left lower extremity, the common femoral, proximal
greater saphenous, superficial femoral and popliteal veins are
normal with appropriate compressibility, wall-to-wall flow on
color analysis and response to waveform augmentation.
Wall-to-wall flow is also seen in the posterior tibial and
peroneal veins in the left calf.
.
IMPRESSION: Right popliteal and distal superficial femoral vein
thrombosis.
.
CXR [**2117-2-13**]
Moderate left pleural effusion has increased and left lower lobe
atelectasis or consolidation has improved. Right lung is grossly
clear. The heart is severely enlarged and dilated pulmonary
arteries are an indication of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Right jugular line ends in the SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**2117-2-16**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion.
.
[**2117-2-12**] 6:12 AM
Nasogastric tube has been advanced into the stomach which is
somewhat less
distended with gas, and out of view. Left lower lobe atelectasis
is worsened, right atelectasis improved. Upper lungs clear.
Borderline cardiomegaly stable. Probable pulmonary hypertension.
Upper lungs clear. Right jugular line ends in the mid to low
SVC. No pneumothorax.
 .
[**2-13**]: left pleural effusion, likely pulm arterial hypertension
 .
CT Head from [**Hospital1 **]: Diffuse cerbral atrophy appropriate for
patient's age, right nasal ganglia calicifactions, no cerebral
ischemia, no ICH, No mass.
 .
CT C Spine: No acute fracture or malalignment. degenerative
changes C5-C7.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo female with h/o DM admitted with HHS and seizure.
