Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD x 2
arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 69-year-old man with COPD, HTN, a. fib on enoxaparin
and coumadin, PE, and recent admission for sternal wound
infection s/p multiple debridements presents from OSH with
unstable upper GI hemorrhage.  Per report, patient developed
episodes of hematemesis and melena yesterday at [**Hospital **] rehab.
He was transferred to [**Hospital3 7362**] where he underwent emergent
EGD overnight.  He was found to have a distal esophageal ulcer
that was clipped x5.  Patient was also started on a PPI and
octreotide drip, given 9 units of PRBCs, 7 units of FFP, 20mg of
IV vitamin K, and protamine.  He was also started on a levophed
gtt for persistent hypotension. After EGD, hct was still ~20,
and patient continued to have copious amounts of melena.
Patient was apparently seen by IR at [**Hospital1 3597**], who did not feel
comfortable intervening with this sort of bleed, and surgery who
did not feel that patient would survive a distal esophagectomy.
As such, Mr. [**Known lastname 63108**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
treatment.

Patient was recently admitted to the cardiothoracic surgery
service for reucrrent sternal wound infections in setting of
CABG.  Mr. [**Known lastname 63108**] was maintained on vancomycin and ceftaz at
rehab.  He also has a history of C.diff for which he is on po
vancomycin.

Upon arrival to ICU, vitals were: HR 107, BP 96/61 on 16mcg of
levophed, SP02 100% on CMV fi02 60%, PEEP 5, tidal volume 500.
Patient has a non-functioning PICC and a left IJ placed at
outside facility.  Gastroenterology, thoracic surgery, and
interventional radiology were called.

EGD [**1-16**]
[**Month/Year (2) **] in the whole Esophagus
5 previously placed endoclips visualized in linear fashion in
distal esophagus terminating at the GE junction. Appearance of
potential ulceration beneath.
[**Month/Year (2) **] in the whole stomach
Red [**Month/Year (2) **], less than seen in stomach and esophagus visualized in
duodenum. No active bleeding source identified.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
EGD [**1-17**]
Five endoclips in a linear pattern from 41 to 45 cm from the
incisors were noted in the esophagus. It is unclear what the
clips were overlying but one clip was positioned over a
protuberance that was suspicious for a varix. There was also
[**Month/Year (2) **] throughout the esophagus without obvious source but likely
emanating from the stomach.
[**Month/Year (2) **] throughout the stomach with a large clot in the cardia and
fundus overlying active oozing of unclear source
[**Name (NI) **] in the visualized portions of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
[**1-18**] CT abdomen/pelvis
1. No evidence of active extravasation. High-attenuation
material in the
stomach could be consistent with hemorrhagic products.
2. Multiple enlarged intra-abdominal lymph nodes, with 3.6-cm
heterogeneous and centrally necrotic mass near pancreatic head.
Following resolution of patient's acute GI bleed, this could be
further investigated by FDG-PET or endoscopic ultrasound-guided
aspiration.
3. Aorto-biiliac stent graft, with no evidence of endoleak or
aortoenteric
fistula.
4. Increased bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites.
5. New loculated pericardial fluid collection, compressing right
atrium and ventricle.

[**1-27**] EUS:
Salmon colored mucosa in a localized pattern suggestive of
Barrett's Esophagus, 3 hemostatic clips found in distal
esophagus.  Biopsies done in the stomach.  Diffuse continuous
nodularity of the mucosa without bleeding in the stomach.
