Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2932**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer with cholangitis for ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, PICC line placement, ERCP


History of Present Illness:
85 yo female transferred from OSH. She was brought to the OSH by
family members on [**2111-12-29**] for a 2 week history of intermittent
dark brown urine, abdominal discomfort, low-grade fevers,
nausea, poor PO intake and jaundice. In the OSH ED, the patient
was noted to be tachycardic and febrile to 101 with a bilirubin
of 11.3 and increased alkaline phosphatase. CT abdomen and
ultrasound demonstrated gallstones, gallbladder sludge, and a
soft tissue density causing obstruction of the distal common
bile duct with biliary ductal enlargement. GI and General
Surgery were consulted and recommended immediate decompressive
surgery and urgent ERCP. Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient
received IVF crystalloid and colloid boluses, Zosyn, Flagyl,
vancomycin, and hydrocortisone. CVP was 13 and urine output was
poor with a total volume of 250mL over 12-24 hours. CXR was
unremarkable. Blood cultures grew gram negative rods (later
identified as klebsiella) and enterococcus. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, the patient complained of diffuse frontal
headache, which resolved w/o any intervention, soreness in her
left shoulder and a transient episode of nausea.

ROS: fevers, left shoulder pain.

Microbiology
At [**Hospital3 **] Health Care wound with enterococci resistant to
ampicillin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, PCN, vancomycin,
sensitive to tetracycline. Blood gram negative rods and gram
positive cocci in pairs from aerobic and anaerobic bottles. Gram
positive rods from anaerobic bottle.

EKG: [**2111-12-30**] EKG: sinus tach, left axis, QIII TWI III, low
voltage in precordial leads

Radiology:
[**2111-12-30**] CXR: AP view shows widened mediastinum, blunted
costophrenic angles bilaterally, cephalization.

[**12-31**] ERCP: There is opacification of the distal half of the
common bile duct. There are no filling defects or strictures
seen within the common bile duct. A stent was placed across the
common bile duct. The pancreatic duct was not opacified.

[**1-4**] MRCP: Within the limits of this non-contrast examination,
the parenchymal morphology of the pancreatic head/ampulla
appears normal, and there is no evidence of pancreatic ductal
dilatation. No evidence of intra- or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation, although evaluation of CBD may be limited by the
presence of biliary stent. Large gallstone in gallbladder.
Sacral decubitus ulcer. Endometrial thickness which appears
thicker than expected in a patient of this age. Bowel  and
fat-containing left abdominal wall hernia.

[**1-5**] RUQ U/S: Patent portal and hepatic veins. Normal arterial
waveforms in the main hepatic artery. Cholelithiasis with no
evidence of cholecystitis. Small right-sided pleural effusion.

[**1-6**] CT Abd pelvis with contrast: Ttwo focal areas of fluid
seen adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach. Along the
more distal pyloric region, the collection measures 2.1 x 1.5
cm. More proximally along the body on the left fluid collection
measures 1.9 x 1.5 cm. Both fluid collections contain small
surrounding soft tissue rim (focal collections of abdominal
fluid vs abscess)

[**1-13**] KUB: No evidence of bowel obstruction or free air

[**1-18**] CXR PA/lateral: Moderate CHF. Bibasilar atelectasis.
Superimposed pneumonia is not excluded


Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old female transferred from OSH [**12-30**] w/
cholangitis/Klebsiella sepsis for ERCP. Initially in ICU given
hypotension. ERCP [**12-31**] was without evidence of biliary
obstruction, but a common bile duct stent was placed. She was
covered broadly with Zosyn/vancomycin, fluid resuscitated, and
transferred to the general medical floor on [**1-3**].

1) Cholangitis, Klebsiella/enterococcus sepsis: CT Abdomen at
outside hospital showed a soft tissue density either within the
duct or as it enters ampulla most consistent periampullary
carcinoma or sludge and debris in distal CBD. ERCP here shows no
pus, stone, or mass. A stent was placed [**12-31**] as mentioned above.
MRCP (limited study) was without mass or biliary/pancreatic
ductal dilatation, although it did show cholelithiasis (should
have outpatient cholecystectomy). Following bile duct stent
placement, her LFTs slow trended down (see discharge labs in
results section). Further work-up for other causes of LFT
abnormalities include HBV panel (negative),  HCV Ab (negative),
AMA (negative), HAV IgM (negative), and RUQ ultrasound (no
evidence of hepatic/portal thrombosis). The patient should
continue to have liver function tests checked twice a week as an
outpatient to ensure downward trend. She will follow-up with the
biliary service in mid-[**Month (only) 404**] for repeat ERCP and stent
removal. For treatment of cholangitis, she was initially treated
with vancomycin/Zosyn, subsequently changed to Cipro/vancomycin,
completing a 20 day course. The infectious disease service
followed her throughout her hospital stay. An Abdomen CT showed
2 small fluid collections along the curvature of the stomach; it
was unclear whether these represented abscesses or focal
collections of abdominal fluid. The surgery service was
consulted, who did not recommend drainage given their size and
her improving clinical status. She will have a repeat Abdomen CT
on [**2111-2-9**] to follow these lesions for resolution.

2) Acute renal failure: On [**1-13**], the patient's creatinine rose
to 1.3 from 0.7. This did not improve with hydration. The
patient declined a renal ultrasound, but she continued to have
good urine output. FeNa was 3%, not consistent with a pre-renal
etiology and urine eosinophils were negative, making acute
interstitial nephritis less likely. Her acute renal failure may
be related to antibiotics (vancomycin vs ciprofloxacin), of
which she has completed her course. At the time of discharge,
the patient's creatinine is 1.7. Her creatinine should be
monitored twice a week as an outpatient to ensure stability.

3) Congestive heart failure: The patient was diuresed with
resolution of hypoxia -
