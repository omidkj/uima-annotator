Brief Hospital Course:
1) Change in MS:likely hepatic encephalopathy, originally it was
thought that this may have been precipitated by UTI. Patient had
a dirty UA and was originally treated with levofloxacin, however
cultures grew out coag neg staph (likely staph epi), thus levo
was stopped after 5 days.  CXR (-). Head CT (-) at OSH. Blood
cx, ucx, sputum cx showed no growth.  Patient had an NGT placed
with lactulose q 2hours, with good result. Patient quickly
became more oriented and therefore NGT was pulled and patient
was allowed to eat. Patient was dc'ed on lactulose QID.
*
2) Anemia: HCT stable 32-34 while in ICU, following 1 u PRBC at
OSH, HCT 21.7 -> 34.6; it was thought that thet HCt of 21.7
likely represents lab error at OSH
While in the hospital, patient was  both gauic (-) and w/ (-) NG
lavage; benign abd exam (-) abd CT. After being transferred to
floor, patient hct was 28, but no signs of bleed. It was
attributed to fluid shifts (as patient had received fluids
secondary to being dry) and closely monitored.
*
3) Cirrhosis: Patient was continued on  rifaximin, propranolol,
ursodiol (initially held). He was also continued on
spironolactone, furosemide. Patient was also continued on the
experimental drug, tolvartan.
*
4) Type II DM: RISS and with glargine.
