Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Gold Salts / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
selective coronary artery angiography with percutaneous coronary
invention and bare metal stent delivery to the LAD
ICD placement
intubation and mechanical ventilation, now extubated
temporary transvenous pacemaker insertion and removal
right subclavian central venous line insertion and removal


History of Present Illness:
64 year old female with history of rheumatoid arthritis and
diabetes who presents with progressive shorntess of breath.
Patient first noted cough about 1 month prior to presentation
associated with some viral URI symptoms.  She completed a course
of azithromycin and the cough improved.  The symptoms returned
and the patient again noted cough, fatigue, and chills for 1
week. She did not seek medical help at this time and took over
the counter medicines.  1 week prior to presentation, she again
noted onset of a non productive cough, but this time was worse
and more progressive.  She had a dose of remicade and also took
a trip to [**Country **] to visit family.  She notes multiple sick
contacts in [**Name (NI) **].  After returning, her cough was now
productive or yellow, white, foamy sputum.  She called her PCP
who gave her a course of a steroid taper.
.
She has noted some chills, but no clear fevers.  She has
progressive DOE going from able to walk miles to now SOB when
walking across the room.  She also has orthopnea.  Since
returning from [**Country **], she has noted some peripheral edema.  She
denies chest pain or chest pain with extertion, but has noted
discomfort with cough.  Otherwise review of systems is negative
for abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, urinary complaints.  She
has noted loose stools x 1 day and increased urinary frequency.
Also decreased appetite.
.
She was clinically diagnosed with CHF and aggressively diuresed.
She subsequently had a V fib arrest requiring 2 shocks to return
her to NSR.  She was awke and alert after the code and repeat
ECG revealed NSR with RBBB, QR V1-V2, no ST elevations or
depressions.  She was transferred to the CCU service and started
on lidocaine drip, heparin drip, levophed drip, given plavix 600
mg x1 and aspirin. Stat bedside echo was performed and again
revealed hypokinesis in the LAD territory and could not r/o
thrombus. Left ventricular walls appears thin.
.
In the ICU she reports some reproducible chest soreness and
difficulty in taking a deep breath given pain.  Her breathing
feels slightly worse because of this, but she is able to lie
flat.  Denies palpitations, dizziness.

Chest Xray:
Cardiac silhouette appears slightly enlarged compared to prior
study. Mediastinal contours appear stable. There is increased
cephalization of the vessels, with increased interstitial and
alveolar capacities most suggestive of CHF. Moderate-to-large
bilateral pleural effusions are seen. No definite focal
consolidation identified. Lumbar scoliosis noted.

IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of CHF with moderate-to-large
bilateral pleural effusions
.
EKG: sinus rhythm with LAD, small Qs anterioseptal, poor R wave
progression, TWI 1 avL

CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY WITH PCI, [**2175-2-17**]
1. Emergency selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant
system demonstrated severe single vessel disease. The LMCA had
mild
luminal irregularities. The LAD was subtotally occluded
proximally and
totally occluded after a small D2 branch. Thrombus was visible
within
the LAD system and faint right-to-left collaterals. The LCX as
well as
the proximal and distal RCA had mild luminal irregularities. The
R-PDA
had an 0% distal lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamic assessment revealed cardiogenic shock
with
cardiac output of 2.67 l/min and cardiac index of 1.62 l/min/m2,
both
obtained after placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. The
systemic
systolic arterial blood pressure ranged from 60 mmHg prior to
placement
of the IABP to a mean augmented BP of 80-95 mmHg after the pump
placement. The pulmonary arterial pressure was moderately
elevated at
39/21/28 mmHg. The filling pressures were moderately-to-severely

elevated with mean PCWP of 22 mmHG.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. An IABP was successfully placed at the beginning of this
procedure
via the right groin 8 French sheath and a 6 French sheath was
placed in
the left groin.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid LAD
with an overlapping 2.5x24mm driver stent in the mid vessel and
a
3.0x18mm driver stent more proximally. The stent overlap segment
was
dilated to 3.0mm. Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow. The
patient left
the lab free of angina and in critical condition.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM, [**2175-2-20**] (POST-ARREST)
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with akinesis of
the mid to distal septum, anterior wall, distal LV and apex.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-2-17**],
the LVEF is slightly lower.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female admitted [**2-12**] with worsening dyspnea and orthopnea
found to have new acute systolic heart failure with an EF of
30-35% and akinesis of septum, anterior wall and
