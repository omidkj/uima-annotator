History of Present Illness:
54 yo female with multiple medical problems including COPD,
asthma, OSA, diastolic LV dysfunction, paroxysmal SVT, DM2
presented from nursing home with acute onset of SOB while
walking to the bathroom.  Sat measured and noted to be 89% RA;
she was given an albuterol treatment and O2 sat down to 42% on
2.5LNC, she was then given atrovent treatment and BiPAP with 60
mg prednisone with BP up to 210/110 and O2 sats up to 71-72% on
2.5LNC.  While waiting for EMS had 2min episode of CP, describes
like heart burn while at rest no radiation, no N/V, was SOB and
diaphoretic, never had this type of pain before. EMS vitals with
Hr 140's  BP 150/60 R20 Sat 100% on RA.  She was feeling better
by time they arrived, but was brought in for evaluation anyways.
 Of note she was recently tapering prednisone to 20mg qod on
[**7-21**] and has noted increased SOB and fluid recently.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to febrile and in SVT. Vitals in ED were
T 101, HR 155, BP 122/110, 100% 2L. Pt received Adenosine IV and
diltiazem IV. SVT broken with IV Diltiazem. Pt has h/o frequent
episodes of SVT managed with po Diltiazem.
.
She notes worsening dyspnea on exertion last night with non
productive cough, and acutely worse this morning and temps here,
but none at home.  No other associated problems, tired, some
weight gain but no LE edema, she says overall compliant with her
BiPAP and nebs.  On ROS, pt denies fever or chills. Notes a
nonproductive cough x 3 days. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Has
SOB with exertion, orthopnea, no chaneg in 3pillow orthopnea.

-EKG: Regular, narrow complex tachycardia, rate 151.  Possibly
2:1 flutter.  No ST segment changes.

of the  diaphragmatic contour, which likely represents
pneumonia. Probable atelactasis at the right lung base.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo woman with PMH DM, obesity, mixed obstructive and
restrictive defect admitted to ICU with hypercarbic respiratory
distress.
.
# COPD exacerbation w/hypercarbic respiratory distress: Patient
is a chronic CO2 retainer with baseline CO2>65. She requires
home BiPAP and 2L of O2 by NC, questionable compliance with
treatment. Patient also has 3 day history of dry cough,
decreased PO intake and recent taper in steroids which raises
the possibility of a community acquired pneumonia. Patient
likely close to baseline in terms of resp status. Patient also
with hx of dyastolic dysfunction, crackles on exam, trace edema
therefore likely concomittant element of CHF. Patient was
diuresed with lasix IV 80 mg x 2. Steroids 60 mg daily and
Levaquin for community acquired PNA. She was treated with BiPAP
[**9-15**] at night and O2 by NC during the day (2-2.5L), PRN
nebulizer treatments. Atovaquone started for PCP prophylaxis
given hx of steroid use and allergy to sulfa. Pt was continued
on slow prednisone taper, singulair, and albuterol and atrovent
nebs at the time of discharge.
.
# Fever: Tm=101 in ED with history of 3 days of dry cough, CXR
negative, ?CAP given patient's long term use of steroids. Sick
contacts from [**Name (NI) **]. Blood and urine culturs were drawn in the ED,
no growth todate. Patient treated with Levaquin for presumed
community acquired pneumonia, despite negative CXR. Pt completed
a 10 day course of levofloxacin.
.
# PSVT: Patient has a history of SVT (MAT) in past. Likely
exacerbated by acute episode of SOB, COPD exacerbation. Patient
was converted with Diltiazem, 1x Adenosine in the Ed. She was
continued on home dose Diltiazem PO for rate control and
monitored on telemetry. Pt had transient episodes of PSVT that
self terminated initially. however, the frequency of PSVT
episodes increased and she had several episodes of SVT that
lasted >30 minutes occuring mostly in the night time with oxygen
saturations dropping into the 50s. This increase in frequency
and duration coincided with the dicontinuation of Metoprolol
12.5 [**Hospital1 **] suspected of worsening her pulmonary obstruction. The
episodes of SVT were broken with 10 mg x3 of IV Diltiazem. An
electrophysiology consult was obtained, and on review of
telemetry, Pt. was found be having episodes of atrial
fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia, which as
she reported, were causing palpitations and dyspnea.  She
underwent an ablation procedure, with marked improvement in
these symptoms.  Her respiratory state, while still tenuous, did
improve to the point where at rest, she was sat-ing in the high
90s on 2L O2NC.  In addition, she has been walking up and down
the [**Doctor Last Name **] without DOE.  She has not had arrhythmias on telemetry
monitoring since the ablation.  She was discharged on verapamil
and lisinopril; her BB was discontinued.
.
# Chest pain: Patient describes burning "esophageal" sensation,
states she has not had this in the past. Occurred with episode
of SOB. EKG negative for ischemia. Cardiac enzymes were
negative. Started on PPI given history of steroid use and
