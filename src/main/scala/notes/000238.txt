History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] is a 74 yo male with recent history of CVA ([**12/2134**]) on
coumadin who presented with rhinorrhea (3 days), productive
cough (2 days) and mental status change (over the 16 hours PTA).
 The night PTA, he had restless sleep, woke at 3:30am and
showered to get ready for the day.  His wife got up at 6:30 and
prepared breakfast.  Prior to breakfast he was sitting [**Location (un) 1131**]
the newspaper and his wife noted that he was "shaking" badly.
He commented that he was "cold".  She took his temp, which was
97F.  They sat down to eat breakfast and he began to act odd.
He sat very far away from the table.  With prompting, he scooted
to the table.  He then was unable to properly use his fork to
eat his eggs.  His wife then called her PCP who recommended that
they go to the ED.  She called 911.

Per the ED report (but no documentation in the chart), the pt
was hypoglycemic in field to 27 and received dextrose.

In the ED, he had a head CT that was negative for bleed or
infarct.  Glucose was 108.  He had a temperature of 104.
Initially his VS were BP 133/78, H 84 and evolved to 90-100s
systolic and HR of 100-120s.  He was given dilt 5mg x 2 for RVR.
 CXR was initially read as right middle lobe infiltrate and he
was given ceftriaxone 1 g and azithromycin 500mg.  There was
some discussion about meningitis, but he was not given
meningitis doses of medications.  His neurologist felt that this
was less likely meningitis and recommended against LP in the
setting of therapeutic INR.

When he arrived to the MICU, his SBPs were in the 70s. An
arterial line was placed. He was bolused 4 more liters with
improvement to 90-100s.

1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial infarct. If
there is continued concern for ischemia, MRI with DWI is more
sensitive.
2.  Extensive bifrontal encephalomalacia.

[**2135-3-4**] CXR:
Likely right middle lobe pheumonia; follow up in 6 weeks
recommended

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2135-3-5**] INFLUENZA DFA:  Positive for Influenza A viral antigen.

Simplex Virus Type 1 by direct antigen staining

[**2135-3-7**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Trace aortic
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] is a 74 yo male who presented with a three-day history
of progressive respiratory symptoms (rhinorrhea, productive
cough, fevers) and mental status change.  He was found to have a
RML pneumonia radiographically and was positive for influenza A.
 On presentation, he initially required aggressive fluid
resuscitation,  but thereafter remained hemodynamically stable.
 He required admission to the MICU for hypotension and concern
for sepsis.  He was started empirically on vancomycin and
ceftrazidime, as well as tamiflu for influenza.  Sputum cultures
were negative.   He competed a five day course of levofloxacin
and tamiflu.

CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:
The patient's course was complicated by delirium, in particular
sun-downing in the evenings.  This was felt to be due to his
underlying flu, pneumonia and the ICU environment.  He became
significantly agitated at night, requiring chemical and
mechanical restraints.  He also required a 1:1 sitter for
safety.  The decision was made to start the patient on a low
dose of seroquel early in the evening, although this was
discontinued by the time of discharge.   His mental status
dramatically improved with treatment of his underlying lung
processes, and he was doing crossword puzzles and had no
evidence of delirium upon discharge.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR:
While in the ICU, the patient was noted to have AFib with RVR
with heart rates as high as 150 during periods of intense
agitation.  He was started on a diltiazem drip.  He later became
hypotensive and was temporarily on digoxin until blood pressure
stabilized, at which point he was restarted on home lopressor.
An ECHO was also obtained which showed normal cardiac function.
He was maintained on coumadin for anticoagulation, though his
INR was labile while on antibiotics.

HSV-1 OUTBREAK:
The patient was noted to have multiple vesicular lesions on the
upper and lower lips in the mid-line, as well as a small area of
vesicles on the right chin and right neck.   DFA was positive
for HSV-1.  He was star
