History of Present Illness:
77F PMH HTN, osteoarthritis, R total hip 10yrs ago, depression
was vacationing in bermuda until [**2168-2-3**], returned home, did not
feel well on the night of return, tired, "did not seem self,"
appeared confused, acting strangely. C/O extremie thirst, no CP,
no SOB, no fevers, no URI-like sx, no nausea, no vomiting, no
dysuria. MS seemed worse on the next am with increased agitation
and confusion, incoherence, emotional changes, so brought to
[**Hospital 16843**] Hospital on [**2-5**]. Lyme negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative. At LH,
dx'd with arf (cr 3.3) baseline 1.1-1.3, dx'd to have a e.coli
uti (10-15wbc, 3+ bacteria) (later found to be quinolone
resistant). BCx eventually grew out ecoli, resistant to
quinolones as well. The patient was started on abx (given levo
in the ed, then changed to cefazolin, then changed to ctx).
Improving MS on the 4th, but then in the afternoon agitated, +
restless, low sats, very emotionally upset, c/o abdominal and
back pain, moved bowels, got back into bed, but was agitated and
found to be hypoxic with sats in the low 80s abg 7.35/24/48/13
on 5L NC, intubated, xferrerd to ICU. HTN 140s-170s-->xferred to
ICU, ecoli in urine found to be R quinolones and sulfa,
sensitive to cephs and pcn. Started on heparin gtt, head ct neg.
CXR showed bilat fluffy infiltraes, concern for ARDS, concern
for PE (V/Q not done, could do CTA due to renal failure), placed
on NRB, satting 96%. Bcx x 2 from [**2-5**] GNRs (later to be found
E.coli).
.
Resp failure was attributed to ards, pt subsequentally intubated
on [**2168-2-8**]; started on versed+MSO4 for sedation, patient was
generally unresponsive, not following commands. Cr improved to
2.4 on [**2-8**]. Pt was tx'd with ctx. On [**2-9**]; pt was on cpap, doing
well, mental status improving. Echo performed [**2-9**]; normal LV fx,
small pericardial effusion. Pt was extubated on [**2-10**], within
12hrs required re-intubation for inability to protect airway.
She was doing well from resp mechanics point of view. Mental
status worsened, patient was more delirious with psychomotor
agitation, moving all 4 extremities at full strength, not able
to interact. Mutliple attemps were made to sedate the patient,
including propofol, which resulted in HTN, so it was stopped,
haldol, versed, ativan. She remained agitated, writhign in bed;
unresponsive to ativan. [**2-11**] CXR poor quality cxr, could not r/o
nosocomial pna, ID ocnsulted. The patient was started on vanc
1gm IV q 24 for hosp acquired PNA, zosyn 3.375 IV q 6 hrs were
started for urosepsis. She was also receiving lopressor 5mg IV q
4hrs for HTH, Morphine and ativan. Neuro consult was obtained
and dx'd pt with toxic metabolic encephalopathy [**1-8**] urosepsis
and resp failure. Psych consulted, dx'ed acute delirium,
recommended celexa and haldol PRN. Pt was never LP's and MRI was
not obtained.

Pertinent Results:
[**2168-2-14**] CXR: AP chest compared to [**2-12**] and 10:

Left lower lobe atelectasis is largely cleared. Mild pulmonary
edema has developed at the right lung base although heart size
is normal and there is no mediastinal vascular engorgement. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. ET tube, left subclavian
line, and nasogastric tube are in standard placements
respectively.
.
[**2168-2-15**] MR HEAD: 1) No evidence of infarction or other acute
process to explain the patient's symptoms.
2) Faint 2-mm contour abnormality off the left ICA at the
expected takeoff of the left opthalmic artery, seen only on the
reformatted MIP images, thought most likely to be artifactual.
If further workup is clinically indicated, a CT angiogram would
better assess this finding.
.
[**2168-2-18**] ABD U/S: Unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.
.
[**2168-2-20**] CXR: The cardiac silhouette is stable. There is
unchanged mild pulmonary edema. There is unchanged small right
pleural effusion with a new left small pleural effusion. There
is no pneumothorax.
.
[**2168-2-23**] ECG: Sinus rhythm
Atrial premature complex
Probable left atrial abnormality
Modest nonspecific T wave changes
Since previous tracing of [**2168-2-19**], sinus tachycardia absent,
delayed R wave
progression less prominent and ST-T wave changes decreased

Brief Hospital Course:
1) DELERIUM:
On initial presentation, the patient was very agitated.  This
improved throughout admission especially after extubation in
ICU.  However, she remained confused and not at her baseline.
Both neurology and geriatrics were consulted.  Workup did not
reveal any organic cause and it was felt delerium was secondary
to acute illness and ICU hospitalization.  MRI was essentially
normal.  An LP was never performed as pt's mental status
improved.  Her mental status was improving slowly but
progressively.  She was started on zyprexa to prevent agitation
with success.  This can be slowly weaned as her delerium
improves.  Based upon discussion with PCP and family, there was
a possiblity of pre-existing underlying dementia which may
explain severity of delerium, but this will need to be formally
evaluated after delerium improves.  Her outpt meds which
included morphine, bupropion were eliminated.
.
2) SEPSIS:
See HPI for prior course.  Pt had resistant E. coli in urine
culture and completed a 14d course of antibiotics with
meropenem.  There was no recurrence of infectious signs or
symptoms after completion of antibiotics.
.
3) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Likely multifactorial with question of ARDS secondary to sepsis.
 After second extubation in ICU and completion of vanco for
pneumonia, pt's respiratory status was stable and
