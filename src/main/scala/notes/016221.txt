a central line, bolused, given kayexalate, and given
antibiotics.  CT ABD was negative for infection and ischemia.
He stabilized in the MICU, was dialized and given kayexalate.
His shortness of breath resolved and his potassium decreased.
He was deemed appropriate for transfer to the floor.

IMPRESSION:  Interval resolution of findings of pulmonary edema,
with no new cardiopulmonary process.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**6-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
  1.  Choledocholithiasis.  Small stone in the common bile duct
within the

moderate
dilatation of the common bile duct, which is not significantly
changed
compared to the prior study.
  2.  Mildly prominent lymph nodes within the hepatoduodenal
ligament and along the left external iliac change which are
nonspecific. Attention can be paid on followup examinations.
  3.  8-mm right retroperitoneal soft tissue nodule abutting the
lateral wall musculature is also a nonspecific finding.
  4.  Vague ground glass opacity in the lingula.  Attention can
be paid to this area on follow-up examinations.

Hip XR [**6-27**]:
IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture or dislocation.  If clinical
concern for
fracture persists, recommend further evaluation with MR.

Left UE graft US [**6-28**]:
