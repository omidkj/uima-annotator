[**2121-6-27**] Placement of Right Percutaneous Nephrostomy Tube


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 year old male with history of nephrolothiasis s/p
percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement for urosepsis
complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR, and nowpresented
with chest pain and atrial fibrillation with RVR.   He reports
that the morning of admission, aids at the rehab wererolling him
for a bath, when he had the acute onset of substernal chest
pressure, radiating down bilateral arms with associated
diaphoresis. He was given 2 SL NTG by EMS which improved pain
from [**10-22**] to [**2-21**]. In addition, he was noted by EMS to be
inatrial fibrillation with RVR. In the ED, patient was noted to
be in atrial fibrillation with RVR. He was admitted for further
evaluation and a cardiac catheterization was obtained and was
found to have coronary artery disease. He is now being referred
to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Past Medical History:
- Coronary Artery Disease
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Chronic Systolic CHF (EF 35% on [**2121-5-8**])
- Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
- Morbid Obesity
- Nephrolithiasis (since [**2069**])- recently obstructive causing
urosepsis, s/p right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement
- s/p bilateral meniscal tears
- Positional vertigo
- Gout
- Right cataract surgery


Social History:
The patient lives with his wife [**Name (NI) **] in [**Location 110442**], MA,
however most recently he has been at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, recently
transferred to [**Location (un) 169**]. He is a retired dry cleaning

Pertinent Results:
Coronary Catheterization [**2121-6-11**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated severe left main and three vessel coronary artery
disease.
The LMCA had a distail 70% stenosis.  The LAD had serial proxmal
and mid
vessel lesions up to 80% in narrowing.  The distal vessel was
small with
diffuse disease.  The LCx had a subtotal occlusion proximally.
The RCA
was a large ectactic vessel.  There was a proximal 70% narrowing
with
diffuse moderate disease and severe disease of the small distal
branch
vessels.  All vessels were heavily calcified.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revaled elevated left
ventricular
filling pressure, with an LVEDP of 20 mmHg.  There was no
transvavular
gradient to suggest aortic stenosis.  There was normal systemic
blood
pressure, with a central aortic pressure of 124/73mmHg.
.
Carotid Series [**2121-6-13**]:
IMPRESSION:  Less than 40% stenosis in the bilateral internal
carotid
arteries.  Mild heterogeneous plaques are seen in the bilateral
proximal
internal carotid arteries.
.
Intra-op TEE [**2121-6-16**]:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid-apical anterior,
anteroseptal sever hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
There is no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB: 1. Improverd global and focal LV systolic function
with persistent WMA's but of lesser severity. EF =35-40% 2. MR
is now mild. 3. No other change in valve structure and function

.
Chest CT Scan [**2121-7-1**]:
1.  Postoperative changes from coronary artery bypass graft with
sternotomy noted and mild stranding of the superficial and
mediastinal soft tissues, likely postoperative in nature without
focal fluid collection.  No evidence of osteomyelitis or
breakdown of the sternal wound. 2.  Left greater than right
moderate pleural effusions with accompanying atelectasis and
right lower lobar consolidative opacity which may reflect
aspiration or developing pneumonia. 3.  Moderate cardiomegaly
with coronary vascular disease, aortic valvular calcifications
and enlarged pulmonary artery suggesting pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL COURSE:
75 yo M with h/o HTN, DMII, nephrolithiasis s/p right
percutaneous nephrostomy tube for obstructing calculus causing
urosepsis, afib on coumadin, now presenting with chest pressure
and diaphoresis with RVR with pseudomonal UTI.

PREOPERATIVE COURSE:
# Demand Ischemia/3-Vessel CAD s/p CABG: Patient was admitted
with chest pain which occurred in the setting of movement, and
on EMS arrival, was found to be in RVR.  He had a mild troponin
leak to a peak level of 0.07 without elevation of CKMB and
without EKG changes.  His chest pain was assessed as demand
ischemia caused by his Afib with rapid ventricular rate.
Patient had recent NSTEMI during prior admission and underwent
C. cath here which showed severe 3 vessel disease includ
