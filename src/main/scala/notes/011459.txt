Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
62 yo M w/ Hemoptysis x 3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with placement of Y-stent to trachea.
Argon Plasma Laser cautery of active bleeding.


History of Present Illness:
62 year old M with history of SCC lung s/p LUL and partial LLL
lobectomy [**7-/2098**], no chemo or radiation who initially presented
to [**Hospital6 33**] [**2100-8-3**] with hemoptysis. Patient states
he had developed a cough and chest congestion w/o fevers. PCP
prescribed [**Name9 (PRE) **] around [**7-24**]. Then around [**8-1**] or so, he noticed
some blood in his sputum. This increased in amount until [**8-4**]
when his wife was concerned enough to bring him to Southshore's
ER. CT showed a mass involving right lateral wall of proximal
trachea pushing carina anteriorly. Bronch at [**Hospital 2079**] hospital
showed blood in trachea and tumor on right lateral tracheal
wall, compromising the terminal trachea and proximal main stem
bronchi. Biopsies were taken and BAL GS showed few polys and
rare GPC. Post-bronch, his O2sats dropped to 70-80s in the
setting of hemoptysis, prompting intubation and transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].

Past Medical History:
PMH:
1) squamous cell left lung CA dx [**2098**], w/ left upper and partial
lower lobectomy [**7-/2098**], no chemotherapy or radiation
2) DM2
3) HTN
4) CAD s/p four stents in [**2096**]
5) IBD


Social History:

Chest CT [**2100-8-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Paratracheal and subcarinal masses within the mediastinum
invading the mid thoracic trachea and distal trachea, carina and
mainstem bronchi. There is marked narrowing of the tracheal and
right and left main stem bronchial lumens due to invasion.
Findings favor secondary invasion of the airway from the
mediastinal nodal masses rather than a primary airway neoplasm.

2. Consolidation within the left lower lobe, likely representing
aspiration, infection, or hemorrhage in the setting of
hemoptysis.
3. Status post left upper lobectomy and wedge resection of the
left lower
lobe.

CXR [**8-9**]:
Increased density involving the entire left hemithorax is
suggestive of left pleural effusion. Associated atelectatic
changes are suspected in the left upper lobe and the left lower
lobe. The right lung is clear. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Increasing left pleural effusion. No evidence of
pneumothorax.

[**2100-8-11**]: Fluoro-guided PICC line placement:
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 35 cm 4-French single
lumen Vaxcel PICC in the right brachial vein. Tip is in the SVC.
The line is ready for use.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED:  TRACHEAL TUMOR (PERM) AND (FROZEN) (3
JARS).

[**2100-8-4**] [**2100-8-4**] [**2100-8-9**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/cma??????

DIAGNOSIS

A.  Tracheal tumor 1:  Combined Squamous cell-Small cell
carcinoma, invasive (see note).

B.  Tracheal tumor 2:  Combined Squamous cell-Small cell
carcinoma, invasive (see note).

C.  Tracheal tumor 3:  Combined Squamous cell-Small cell
carcinoma, invasive (see note).

Note:

1) Immunostains for P63, chromogranin (focal), synaptophysin and
TTF-1 are all positive in subsets of the tumor cells.

2) An in-situ squamous carcinoma/dysplasia is present suggesting
a separate primary.

3) Slides were reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **].

Clinical:  None given.

Gross:  The specimen is submitted in three parts.  Part 1 is:
tracheal tumor.  Part 2 is: tracheal tumor.  Part 3 is: tracheal
tumor.

Part 1 is received fresh in the O. R. and consists of multiple
fragments of  tan and red soft tissue aggregate measuring 1.4 x
1.2 x 0.3 cm.  The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen
sectioned, and frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is:
"carcinoma; foci of non-small cell carcinoma present; component
of small round blue cells also present.  (Lymphoid cells vs.
small cell component); final diagnosis pending permanent
sections."   The frozen section remnant is entirely submitted in
A.

Part 2 is labeled "tracheal tumor" and consists of a 1.1 x 0.2
cm aggregate of  clotted blood and pink tissue fragments.  The
specimen is entirely submitted B.

Part 3 is labeled "tracheal tumor" and consists of multiple
small fragments of tan brown blackened tissue aggregating 1.0 x
1.0 x 0.5 cm, entirely submitted in C.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65 y/o M w/ h/o CAD, T2DM, htn, and squamous cell CA of
left lung admitted to [**Hospital 2079**] Hospital [**8-3**] w/ hemoptysis d/w
lung CA s/p intubation for worsening hemoptysis/hypoxia,
extubated [**8-6**] and currently stable on 2 L NC w/o further
hemoptysis.

# Hemoptysis: Likely due to malignant mass. S/p argon laser tx
to invading tumor [**8-4**]. Hct stable w/o transfusion since [**8-4**].
Hematocrit 28.1 on day of discharge.
.
# Lung cancer: Patient underwent bronchoscopy for bx/tx/dx and
path c/w recurrent SCC. Chest CT was repeated here and shows a
paratracheal and subcarinal mass invading the right and left
mainstem bronchi. He had a Y-tube stent placed to maintain
patency of the airways. CEA 4.0. Thoracic surgery was consulted
and deemed Mr. [**Known lastname **] not an operable candidate. Medical
oncology and radiation oncology consulted during this admission.
Plan for chemoradiation. Patient wishes to do radiation
treatments at [**Hospital3 3583**]. Appointment made for him to see
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 99212**]. Medical oncology here will be contacting patient
with his appointment with them. He has been scheduled for an
outpatient PET scan for staging.
.
# MRSA pneumonia: Patient w/ hypoxia on presentation. Extubated
[**2100-8-6**] but w/ persistent O2 requir
