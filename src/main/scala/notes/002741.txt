[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   69 year old man with s/p avr, cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   evaluate effusion, atx



Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Follow up of a patient after aortic
valve
replacement.

PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were compared to [**1-28**], [**2124**].

The right internal jugular line has been removed in the interum.
The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The position of the
replaced aortic
valve is unchanged. The bilateral pleural effusions are small to
moderate and
are unchanged as well. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
There is no
evidence of failure. Bibasilar atelectasis most likely secondary
to pleural
effusion.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2125-1-27**]  12:03:02 PM


Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature complex
Probable left atrial abnormality
Left axis deviation may be due in part to left anterior
fascicular block and/or
possible prior inferior myocardial infarction
Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition
ST-T wave abnormalities
These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2125-1-24**], probably no significant
change

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2124-12-28**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. False LV tendon (normal variant). Severely depressed
LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Mildly dilated RV
cavity. Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated ascending
aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).
Normal AVR gradient.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate [[**11-24**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views. Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views.
Suboptimal image quality - bandages, defibrillator
