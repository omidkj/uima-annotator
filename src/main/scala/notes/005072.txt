HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70 year old
gentleman with a history of hypercholesterolemia, history of
exertional angina for about a year, who originally presented
to [**Hospital3 3583**] with the onset of chest pain and tightness
at rest and subsequently was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.
Patient states that over the course of the last year he has
had exertional angina when taking long walks, but over the
course of three weeks the episodes got more frequent.  He
describes them as chest tightness and dyspnea in the
mid-chest.  He had a similar episode at rest lasting 1 1/2
hours.  Episode resolved, followed by another one that made
him eventually go to the hospital.  EKG showed sinus
bradycardia, [**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions in leads V1 to V4, ST
elevation in V6.  Patient was diagnosed with acute posterior
MI and received two doses of Retavase 20 minutes after
arrival.  He was also started on heparin drip, nitro drip and
was given metoprolol.  He was subsequently asymptomatic after
2 mg of morphine en route to [**Hospital1 188**].  Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department, ST
depressions on EKG were improved and patient was asymptomatic
and hemodynamically stable.  Chest x-ray was normal per
outside hospital report.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  BPH.  Hypercholesterolemia diet
controlled.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Rotator cuff repair.  Left carpal
tunnel repair.  Left hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin.

ALLERGIES:  Typhoid vaccine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, lives with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] a son.  Retired.  Used to be very active, now activities
limited by exertional angina.  No history of tobacco or
illicit drug use.  Occasional alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were temperature 98.4,
blood pressure 80s to 110 over 50s to 60s, pulse 60,
respirations 16, O2 sat 99% on 2 liters by nasal cannula.  In
general, the patient was a pleasant gentleman in no apparent
distress.  HEENT pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles were intact.
Normal oropharyngeal mucosa.  Neck no bruits, jugular venous
pressure approximately 4 cm above the clavicles.  Pulmonary
clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezing, crackles or
rhonchi.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm, normal S1,
S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen positive bowel
sounds, soft, nondistended, nontender, no organomegaly.
Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.7, hemoglobin 12.4,
hematocrit 36.9, platelets 194.  INR 1.1.  Labs from the
outside hospital CK 174, troponin I 0.024.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the CCU
after being evaluated in the emergency room.  Patient is
status post posterior MI, status post Retavase thrombolytic
treatment times two at the outside hospital.

1.  Cardiovascular.  Acute coronary syndrome, status post
acute MI with EKG changes suggestive of posterior wall MI.
Asymptomatic upon arrival to the CCU.  EKG suggestive of
resolution of ischemia and good reperfusion after lytic
therapy.  Patient was continued on aspirin, heparin drip.
Was restarted on metoprolol 12.5 b.i.d., on a statin and on a
nitro drip.  Patient remained chest pain free overnight.
Patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization lab in the
morning.  During cath his pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
(PCWP) was 18.  Patient was found to have mid-RCA total
occlusion with collaterals and OM1 lesion, both of which were
stented.  After cardiac catheterization patient had a brief
episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressure of 80.
Patient was subsequently given atropine and dopamine and
returned to the CCU.  Upon return to the CCU, patient had
nausea and had an episode of hematemesis.  Nasogastric lavage
was performed and it did not clear with 2 liters of normal
saline.  The lavage fluid was grossly bloody and nonbilious.
Integrilin was held.  Patient was started on IV Protonix.
Serial hematocrits were stable at 36.  GI consult was called
and it was felt that patient was hemodynamically stable and
had gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of
anticoagulation and lytic therapy.  Therefore, it was
prompted to carefully monitor the patient with serial
hematocrits and not to do endoscopy at that time.  From the
cardiovascular standpoint, patient has done extremely well.
Patient was transferred to the regular floor and has not had
any subsequent episodes of chest pain.  Patient was treated
with aspirin, Plavix, atenolol, lisinopril and a statin which
was transitioned to patient's outpatient regimen.  Patient
has had no alarming rhythms on telemetry.

2.  GI.  The patient had an episode of acute gastrointestinal
bleeding in the setting of being anticoagulated with two
doses of lytic therapy at the outside hospital as well as
Integrilin post cardiac catheterization.  Integrilin was
held.  Patient has had stable hematocrits and no further
episodes of bleeding.  It was decided that since this was in
the setting of anticoagulation, patient would, however,
benefit from being treated with Protonix and being followed
in the outpatient gastroenterology office four to six weeks
after discharge for probable endoscopic evaluation.

3.  Pulmonary.  The patient has maintained good oxygen
saturation and has not required supplemental O2 since
transfer from the cardiac intensive care unit.

4.  Renal.  The patient has had stable creatinine and
received appropriate post cardiac catheterization hydration.

5.  Endocrine.  The patient has a good lipid profile,
however, since patient is status post MI and status post
stent, he will continue to be on statin therapy as an
outpatient.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute posterior myocardial infarction.
2.  Gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of treatment
with thrombolytics.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Nitroglycerin 0.3 mg sublingual p.r.n.
3.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times nine months.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Tamsulosin 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s.
6.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Lovastatin 40 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient is to follow up with his primary care
physician in one week.  The patient also is to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 15020**] office is to
contact the patient with an appointment date.  Patient is to
have an echocardiogram four weeks after discharge.  Patient
is also to follow up with gastroenterologist to be
recommended by patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in four to six weeks.
