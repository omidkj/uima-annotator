Chief Complaint:
Confusion/weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extubation


History of Present Illness:
71 year old with a hx. of COPD, HTN, who was taken by her sons
to [**Hospital3 **] today after having two days of confusion,
weakness, diminished PO intake, weakness, dyspnea at home.  At
[**Hospital1 **], reportedly found to have a chest XR revealing bilateral
PNA, was using accessory muscles to breathe, and was in
respiratory distress, unable to speak in full sentences.  She
had significant wheezing on exam.  She was given a dose of
levaquin and solumedrol IV.  While there, she progressively
became more obtunded, and had ABG revealing hypercarbic
respiratory failure with 7.2/95/66/37.  She was intubated, and
started on Neosynephrine for sbp of 73/47.  An ECG there
revealed ST elevations in the inferior leads (II, III, F).  She
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] for further management.  On arrival
here, she was found to have a sbp of 48.  A central line was
placed in the Rt. subclavian vein.  Cardiology was consulted,
and they felt that the ECG was not especially convincing for an
IMI, given the ECG here did not show the degree of ST changes as
those of the OSH, and that there were no enzyme or marker
elevations, and no reciprocal changes.  A cxr here did not
reveal any infiltrates.  UA was negative.  Blood cultures were
sent.  She was given 4 mg IV ativan for sedation and her Neo was
up to 60 ucg per minute.  Her sbp was in the 90's, and she was
transferred to the CCU (MICU team).  On arrival there, she was
transitioned to Levophed, and an a line was placed.  Fentanyl
and Versed were started for sedation.

Pertinent Results:

.
CXR: slightly increased bibasilar atelectasis. right SC line in
SVC.
No evidence of CHF or PTX
.
ECHO [**2196-2-22**]:
Conclusions:
Poor image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates
an E/e' <8 suggesting a normal left ventricular filling
pressure. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Free
wall motion is good. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be estimated. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with good
free wall
motion. Preserved global left ventricular systolic function.
.
[**2-21**]: LENI:
LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND (BILATERAL): Grayscale, color,
and Doppler images of the right and left common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were obtained. Normal
flow, compressibility, augmentation, and waveforms are
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus is identified.

IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in right or left common
femoral, superficial femoral, or popliteal veins.
.
[**2-21**]: CXR:
Endotracheal tube is 3 cm above carina. Right jugular CV line is
in proximal SVC. No pneumothorax. NG-tube is difficult to
localize on this film, but appears to extend below the
diaphragm. No pneumothorax. There is slight elevation of the
left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left costophrenic angle.
Small area of ill-defined opacity consistent with atelectasis is
present at the right lung base.
.
[**2-22**]: CXR:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral lower lobe opacities, right greater than
left with associated bronchial wall thickening. Aspiration or
evolving aspiration pneumonia should be considered.
.
[**2196-2-25**]:AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The previously seen bibasilar
atelectasis is slightly more prominent on today's exam. There is
a right subclavian line with its tip in the upper SVC. There is
no pneumothorax. No CHF. The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
contours are stable.

IMPRESSION: Slightly worsened bibasilar atelectasis.
.
[**2-27**] CXR:
HISTORY: 71-year-old woman with hypotension, possible fluid
overload or focal infiltrates. Patient with worsening
respiratory distress.

FINDINGS: Compared to previous study from [**2196-2-25**].

The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is within normal limits
and unchanged. There remains some streaky density at the bases
most consistent with subsegmental atelectasis, right side is
slightly worse in the interval. There are no signs of focal
consolidation or pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following transfer to [**Hospital1 **], pt was transitioned from neo to
levophed (d/c'd [**2-22**]), and central line was placed. Cardiology
was consulted, who felt the patient was unlikely to have had MI
given inconsistent EKG and negative cardiac markers. She
continued steroids for COPD/possible adrenal insufficiency and
levo/flagyl (subsequently flagyl d/c given low suspicion of
aspiration) for pneumonia. He
