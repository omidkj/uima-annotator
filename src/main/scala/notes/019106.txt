Ms [**Known lastname 59838**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] R AKA on [**11-1**], and had done well post-op
until POD4, [**11-5**] 5am when was she found by nurse to be
"unresponsive." She was not responding to questions, and not
moving unless given painful stimuli. Patient was intubated.
Neurology was consulted. Head CT was suggested with DDx of
infarct vs bleed. IVC filter placed on [**11-12**]. She was extubated
on [**11-13**]. Later Head CT shown to have noncommunicating
hydrocephalus secondary in the posterior fossa. MRI showed
diffuse edema of pons, occipital lobe, and cerebellum; etiology
of edema thought to be hypertensive encephalopathy. Patient was

On [**11-19**], patient was intubated secondary to apnea; she was also
bradycardic in the 40s. Ventricular drain was placed on [**11-22**];

tolerated procedure and was transferred back to MICU-A. She was
extubated on [**11-26**].

On [**11-27**], she developed flash pulmonary edema for second time
this admission; was tachy in 130s, hypertensive in the 210s, and
tachypneic in the 30s. She was re-intubated for 3rd time this
admission.

Today, [**11-28**], CVPs remain low; Echo on [**11-21**] negative. No
