Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4028**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation/extubation
central line placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yof with hx of COPD on home 02, Bronchiectasis,
Diastolic CHF, Aortic Stenosis, HTN, DM diet controlled Found
obstunded at home in resp failure- put on bipap- then intubated
on arrival. Was given steroids. Sputum sample- MRSA- started on
vanco. Patient was suicidal. She wanted to be DNR/DNI- psych was
consulted; suicidality not endorsed to psych. Didn't recommend
1:1 sitter. She is on 2L nasal cannula. Not on home O2. needs
picc for MRSA PNA. Also UTI- on cipro. Was obtunded/respiratory
status was [**2-11**] OD of ambien and ativan. Also- resp failure may
have been PNA than COPD.

Patient caretaker pulled lifeline and pt was found by EMS in
respiratory distress and placed on BiPAP , she was given 6 NTG
and Lasix 40mg IV by EMS prior to arrival. In the ED she was
still in respiratory distress. She was intubated and given
solumedrol, levaquin, and nebulizers for possible COPD
exacerbation. Labs showed a UTI on U/A so she was also given
ceftriaxone. She was tranfered to CCU [**1-5**] for COPD
exacerbation in setting of UTI. There is also a question of her
accidentally, or purposefully taking extra ambien and thereby
depressing respirations and precipitating resp distress. Pt
extubated [**1-6**]. She continues on steroids and nebs. PT has been
hypertensive with hx of diastolic dysfunction and AS. Home
cardiac regimen not yet restarted. She has foley. She began
eating [**1-7**] and needs pureed food as she does not have dentures
here, and does not wear them at home as they are too painful.
Post extubation she expressed the desire to die. Seen by psych
[**1-7**] for suicidal ideation who felt she was not suicidal or a
danger to herself. She is full code. She is MRSA positive by
routine nasal swab. + LLL PNA. OOB to chair today w/ one person
assist.

FEV1/FVC 95%.
--Bronchiectasis: history of atypical mycobacteria on sputum
culture in [**2191**]- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21848**].
-Aortic stenosis: Last ECHO on [**1-/2197**] shows moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
--Diastolic CHF: on home lasix
-Cholelithiasis/cholangitis

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old with shortness of breath. Evaluate for
ET tube
placement and pneumonia.

COMPARISON: [**2198-9-18**].

SINGLE AP SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST: ET tube terminates 3.3 cm
above the
carina. An NG tube descends below the diaphragm, with tip not
visualized.
Superimposed on the patients long-standing interstitial
abnormality,
there are increased interstitial markings, Kerley B lines, and
mild increase
in the cardiac silhouette, consistent with mild interstitial
pulmonary edema.
No effusion. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Heart
size is top
normal and the aorta remains tortuous.

IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube in satisfactory position.

2. Mild pulmonary edema superimposed on chronic interstitial
abnormality.

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old with altered mental status. Evaluate for
stroke
complaints.

No prior examinations.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage
or major
vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
is preserved.
Extensive periventricular hypoattenuation is consistent with
chronic
microvascular ischemic disease. Encephalomalacia in the right
occipital lobe,
related to prior infarct. There is an 8-mm calcification along
the right
parietotemporal dura, which may represent a calcified
meningioma. There is
extensive calcification within the carotid siphons and vertebral
arteries.
There is extensive pneumatization of the petrous apices. The
visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. No skull
fracture or soft
tissue abnormalities identified.

IMPRESSION:

1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

2. Encephalomalacia related to prior right occipital lobe
infarct.

3. Extensive small vessel ischemic disease.

4. Calcified dural-based lesion in the right parieto-occipital
lobe may
represent a meningioma.

PORTABLE CHEST [**2199-1-8**]

COMPARISON: [**2199-1-7**]

INDICATION: COPD exacerbation.

FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is normal in size. Previously
present
widespread interstitial pulmonary edema on [**2199-1-7**] has
resolved.
Small pleural effusions are present, right greater than left.
These may be
due to patchy atelectasis, aspiration or early pneumonia.
Followup
radiographs may be helpful in this regard.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with COPD on home O2 of 2L and
severe aortic stenosis p/w MRSA bronchitis/pneumonia and urinary
tract infection. Patient was intially admitted to the MICU and
worsened respiratory depression secondary to medication and was
intubated for 24 hours. Patient was extubated and was found to
have MRSA pneumonia, treating as HAP with Vancomycin IV through
PICC line until [**2199-1-16**]. Patient was treated with Cipro for
pansensitive EColi urinary tract infection until [**2199-1-13**]. Patient
was called out of the unit on [**2199-1-8**] and on the floor was
noted to have acute renal failure secondary to overdiruesis and
dehydration. Resolved with gentle fluids. Patient was placed at
an extended care facility.
.
# COPD - Pt had an acute exacerbation secondary to MRSA
Pneumonia/bronchitis. Patient was sent to the MICU after being
intubated. There is an additional component of pulmonary edema
from the CHF which resolved with Lasix. Aspergillus was
determined to be a colonizer and not relevant clinically.
Patient was extubated and called out to the floor. Patient was
started on Vancomycin, PICC line was placed and patient to
recieve 8 day course for MRSA in sputum. Patient was placed on
prednisone taper starting at 60mg PO daily. Nebulizers were
continued. Patient quickly returned to baseline oxygen
requirement of 2L. Survillance cultures were negative.
.
# UTI - Urine cultures were done and positive for
E.Coli/Lactobaccilus. Patient will be treated with a one week
course of Cipro.
.
# dCHF - patient was gently diuresed. At the time of discharge
patitent was euvolumeic and severe aortic stenosis was stable.
.
# HTN - Pt's outpatient meds were resumed.
.
# ARF - This was likely secondary to overdiruesis, and
self-resolved once Lasix was stopped. Patient give gentle a NS
250cc bolus x 1 with urine output and ARF improving further.
Lasix was resumed at discharge.
.
# Physical therapy - patient seen by PT here and is to continue
PT as outpatient.
.
# FEN- regular
.
# PPX- Heparin SC, PPI
.
# CODE- Full
