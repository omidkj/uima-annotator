HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
man with a history of coronary artery disease and congestive
heart failure, who was transferred from an outside hospital
with complaints of shortness of breath and congestive heart
failure after ruling in for a non-Q wave myocardial
infarction.  He also had a history of restrictive lung
disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting,
multiple admissions for congestive heart failure with the
last being on [**2142-7-16**] and [**2142-8-9**], chronic renal
insufficiency and renal cell carcinoma status post right
nephrectomy and prostate carcinoma.  He was transferred at
this time from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for continued
management of shortness of breath, congestive heart failure
and a non-Q wave myocardial infarction.

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital from
[**Hospital 27838**] Rehabilitation on [**2142-8-13**] with shortness of
breath and desaturations to the 70s.  He was treated for
congestive heart failure with diuresis, with minimal
improvement over several days.  He ruled in for a non-Q wave
myocardial infarction on [**2142-8-14**] in the setting of
continued likely demand ischemia from hypoxia.

The patient underwent a pulmonary workup including a
ventilation perfusion scan, which was read as low probability
for pulmonary embolus, and a CT scan of the chest, which was
consistent with diffuse interstitial lung disease.  The
patient was covered with an unknown antibiotic over an
unclear duration for assumed underlying pneumonia.  Despite
this treatment and continued supplemental oxygen, the patient
continued to have low oxygen saturation, prompting intubation
on [**2142-8-17**].  He eventually extubated on [**2142-8-23**], but had
since remained tenuous, requiring BiPAP and 100%
nonrebreather.

On [**2142-8-28**], a pulmonary artery catheter was placed to
investigate pulmonary versus cardiac etiology of his hypoxia.
By report, the initial numbers were consistent with a cardiac
output of 5.1, a cardiac index of 2.5 and a pulmonary artery
diastolic pressure of 25.  In the two to three days preceding
transfer, he had a worsening oxygen requirement, requiring
continuous BiPAP.  On [**2142-8-29**], the patient complained of
chest pain and an electrocardiogram by report showed ischemic
changes.  He was started on intravenous nitroglycerin and
received Lopressor and Lasix.  His cardiac enzymes were
elevated with a positive troponin and CK MB.  He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**]
cardiac care unit for continued management.  Upon arrival,
the chest x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure,
rales were audible on examination and he was requiring BiPAP
to maintain his oxygen saturation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient an allergy to morphine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Prior to his hospitalization, the patient
was residing at [**Hospital 27838**] Rehabilitation.  He had been
previously living with his daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] was a former
pharmacist.  He was a former cigar smoker, but had smoked no
cigarettes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a blood pressure of
113/58, a heart rate of 81 in atrial fibrillation, a
respiratory rate of 32, a temperature of 98.1??????F and an oxygen
saturation of 95% on 65% oxygen by BiPAP.  In general, the
patient was an agitated, tachypneic male with BiPAP mask on.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, we were
unable to assess jugular venous distention.

The lungs had rales halfway up bilaterally with dry crackles
audible halfway up.  The patient had discreet decreased
breath sounds in the right upper lobe.  The heart was
irregular with an S1 and S2 and no rubs, murmurs or gallops.
The abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended with good
bowel sounds.  The extremities had trace lower extremity
edema.  On neurological examination, the patient was moving
all extremities had answered questions with nodes.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
14,200, hematocrit of 26.9, platelet count of 150,000 and MCV
of 91.  Prothrombin time was 12.7, partial thromboplastin
time was 36.9 and INR was 1.1.  There was a sodium of 145,
potassium of 3.6, chloride of 100, bicarbonate of 30, BUN of
81, creatinine of 2.2 and glucose of 93.  ALT was 29, AST was
73, alkaline phosphatase was 110 and total bilirubin was 0.3.
Troponin was greater than 50 and CK was 89.  Albumin was 3.0,
calcium was 8.7, phosphorus was 4.8 and magnesium was 1.8.
Arterial blood gases were 7.35/69/169.

RADIOLOGY DATA:  A portable chest x-ray revealed bilateral
vascular congestion and cephalization with congestive heart
failure.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  An electrocardiogram was normal sinus
rhythm at 73 beats per minute, borderline left axis and left
ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria, primary
atrioventricular block with a P-R of 210, isolated [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
elevations in aVF also seen previously, Q waves in leads III
and aVF and ST depressions in V4 to V6.

TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  A transesophageal
echocardiogram from [**2142-7-11**] showed depressed left
ventricular and right ventricular function, 1 to 2+ mitral
regurgitation and no clot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Briefly, the patient is an 83-year-old
gentleman with a complex past medical history, who presented
with hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of a recent
non-Q wave myocardial infarction as well as underlying
interstitial lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  His hospital course is summarized by systems as
follows:

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure on [**2142-8-31**].  He was diuresed for
suspected congestive heart failure with a Lasix drip.  On
[**2142-9-1**], a sputum sample revealed Methicillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus which was treated with a 14 day course
of oxacillin.  On [**2142-9-4**], a gallium scan was performed due
to a question of amiodarone toxicity versus methotrexate
toxicity.  No evidence of an acute pulmonary process was seen
on the scan.  On [**2142-9-8**], a sputum culture revealed
infection with Pseudomonas and treatment was begun with
levofloxacin and ceftazidime.  The ceftazidime was later
discontinued, as the organism was found to be pansensitive.
A repeat sputum culture from [**2142-9-10**] again grew out
Pseudomonas and sensitivities for this were missing or
pending.  On [**2142-9-9**], a CT scan of the chest revealed
bilateral lower lobe pneumonia,
