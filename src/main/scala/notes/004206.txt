CTA CHEST [**2111-4-21**]:
INDICATION: 76-year-old male with severe COPD presenting with
acute onset
shortness of breath and chest pain. Evaluate for pulmonary
embolus.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior chest radiographs. No prior
cross-sectional
imaging of the chest is available.

TECHNIQUE: Low-dose noncontrast full inspiration MDCT imaging of
the chest,
followed by MDCT imaging following the administration of 100 cc
of Optiray
intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformats were prepared and
reviewed.

FINDINGS:
There is severe emphysema bilaterally, with marked bullous
change most
prominent in the left lower lobe. There is no pneumothorax.
There is no
focal pulmonary consolidation, and no definite nodule or mass
identified.
There is a small left pleural effusion. There is associated
rounded
atelectasis at the left lung base, as well as a focus of
atelectasis adjacent to the superior aspect of the left major
fissure.

There is no evidence of acute aortic syndrome. There is
atherosclerotic
disease involving the thoracic aorta, with no aneurysmal
dilatation. The
aorta is mildly tortuous. The origins of the SMA and celiac
access are
narrowed. Also incompletely visualized in the upper abdomen is
an infrarenal aortic endograft.

The pulmonary arteries are well opacified, allowing for
exclusion of pulmonary embolus centrally and to the segmental
level. Subsegmental evaluation, however, is somewhat limited by
motion, though there is no evidence for PE at this level either.


The heart and mediastinal structures are within normal limits.
There are no endobronchial lesions. The esophagus appears
normal. There are no enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. A small
lymph node in the right hilum is noted, measuring up to 9 mm in
short axis. There is no pericardial effusion. There is no
pneumomediastinum. A left subclavian approach vascular catheter
enters the superior vena cava.

There is no acute abnormality identified in the visualized
portion of the
upper abdomen. Within the limits of an arterial phase study, the
visualized portion of the spleen and liver appear normal.

BONE WINDOWS: There is exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic
spine, with
multilevel spondylosis. There are no compression deformities and
no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate-to-severe emphysema, with bullous change most
predominant in the left lower lobe. No pneumothorax.

2. Small left pleural effusion. Associated relaxation and
rounded
atelectasis.

3. No pulmonary nodule or mass is identified. No focal pulmonary

consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

4. No evidence for acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolus.

5. Marked thoracic kyphosis and multilevel spondylosis without
compression
deformity or suspicious lytic/sclerotic lesion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

DR. [**First Name (STitle) 3934**] [**Name (STitle) 3935**]

[**2111-4-19**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: No evidence of
DVT.

[**2111-4-20**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the apical anterior wall and septal and the apex.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
promient fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Dilated and
borderline hypokinetic right ventricle with mmoderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. No significant valvular
abnormality seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 yo male with history of severe COPD on home O2
presenting with acute onset of SOB and CP while at rest.

Acute Onset SOB: The patient was ruled out for a PE with a CTA
of his chest, had decreased air movement and improved with
BiPAP, steroids and bronchodilators.  O2 sats were 95% on 4L via
nasal cannula upon discharge, at home he uses 2L NC.  At times
the patient would be short of breath and would have improvement
with small doses of IV ativan 0.25mg and bronchodilators,
occasionally BiPAP was useful but the patient found this
uncomfortable if used for more than
