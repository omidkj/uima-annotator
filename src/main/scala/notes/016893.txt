Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38492**] was admitted on [**2170-2-2**] and taken to the operating
room for Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, left
video-assisted  thoracic surgery, decortication and pleurectomy.
He was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the
PACU for monitoring.  While in the PACU he became hypotensive
likely secondary to fluid loss requiring pressors and fluid. He
was transferred to the SICU.  The 2 chest-tube were placed to
low-wall suction x 72 hrs with moderate serosanguinous drainage
and moderate respiratory variation. He was followed with serial
chest-films which showed a small stable pneumothorax and
atelectasis. His pain was managed via an Bupicaine/Dilaudid
Epidural with good control. On POD1 his volume status improved,
wean from pressors and transferred to the floor. His diet was
advanced as tolerated. On POD2-3 his home medications were
restarted as tolerated.  He was seen by physical therapy who
deemed him safe for home.  On POD4 the chest-tube were placed to
water-seal and follow-up chest film confirmed stable small
apical pneumothorax.  The epidural was removed and his pain was
well controlled with PO pain medication.  The foley was d/c'd
and he voided without difficulty.  On POD5 the apical chest tube
was removed.  Follow-up chest film was stable subcutaneous
emphysema, left atelectasis, consolidation, and fluid. On POD6
the basilar chest-tube remained on water-seal with moderate
serosanguinous drainage.  On POD7 the chest-tube drainage
subsided and was converted to pneumostat. The discharge
chest-film showed stable small left apical pneumothorax and
atelectasis.  He and his wife were instructed on pneumostat care
and he was discharged to home.  He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient next week.
