Chief Complaint:
clogged G tube

History of Present Illness:
80-year-old man with PMHx of CAD, COPD, dementia and seizure
disorder who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for complaint of
clogged G-tube. Per [**Hospital1 **] records, pt was at baseline but
wasn't able to receive po meds due to clogged G-tube and was
sent in for evaluation. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt was
uncomfortable with increasing oxygen requirement.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 100.0 P 60 BP 188/85 R 24 O2
sat 98% on NRB and RA sat in the 80s%. Pt was notably tachypneic
and in mild respiratory distress. ABG revealed acute on chronic
respiratory acidosis 7.41/74/67. Portable CXR was concerning for
right sided PNA and he received vanc/pip-tazo for empiric
coverage of HAP. He did not tolerate BiPAP trial due to beard
and discomfort. It was felt that the hypercarbia was not acute
given his alert and agitated mental status with intermittent
yelling.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was yelling intermittently but denying
any pain when questionned. He reports shortness of breath which
began approximately 3 days ago and occaisional cough that is
non-productive. He denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or
chest pain. He reports feeling hungry and thirsty, though
further review of symptoms difficult to obtain due to MS.

Images:
CXR [**2122-8-15**]: IMPRESSION: Diffusely increased pulmonary opacity,
particularly on the right. Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2122-8-16**]: Findings are consistent with right lung multifocal
opacities that might be worrisome for infectious process
accompanied by bilateral pleural effusion. The percutaneous
gastrostomy tube is noted.
.
CXR [**2122-8-17**]: IMPRESSION: Improved right upper/lower lung
opacities; bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
show no change.
.
CXR [**2122-8-18**]: (extubated) Lower lung volumes post-extubation with
no interval change, stable moderate right pleural effusion and
left lower lobe atelectasis.
.
Echo [**2122-7-23**]: IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease. Moderate
aortic stenosis. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate
eccentric mitral regurgitation.
.
EKG [**2122-8-15**]: NSR with HR of 79, peaked T waves essentially
unchanged from prior tracings, no other acute ST-T wave changes

.
EKG [**2122-8-18**]: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2122-8-17**] atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response and lateral ST-T wave changes
have appeared and marked increase in rate. Clinical correlation
is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
80-year-old man with PMHx of CAD, COPD, dysphagia and seizure
disorder who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for clogged G-tube
but found to be in respiratory distress with pneumonia.
.
# Pneumonia: Pt was found to be in repiratory distress in the ED
and was admitted to the MICU for possible pneumonia with
pulmonary edema seen on CXR. Empiric vancomycin and
piperacillin-tazobactam were started. When he got to the MICU he
was yelling intermittently but denying any pain when questioned.
At one point on his first night in the ICU, he became very quiet
with O2 saturation dropping; he then stopped breathing and
became apneic. He was emergently intubated, with post-intubation
hypotension requiring pressors briefly. Furosemide was given
intermittently with good urine output and improvement of
respiratory status. Acetezolamide was given to waste bicarb and
stimulate respiratory drive. Neurology was consulted and thought
that the episode was not a seizure. Neurology was convinced that
he may have had a stroke in the past and this is the reason for
his swallowing difficulty. The patient was extubated within 30
hours. The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to cefepime
and ciprofloxacin, but after the sputum culture grew out E. coli
and Proteus sensitive to cephalosporins and resistant to
ciprofloxacin, the regimen was changed to ceftriaxone. The
14-day course of antibiotics will end on [**2122-8-26**].
.
# History of CAD: has been followed by cardiology. Echo in
[**2122-7-4**] showed focal wall motion abnormality, LVEF 40%. He
had no chest pain. CE negative and EKGs at baseline. Suspected
acute on chronic pleural effusions [**1-5**] heart failure. He was
started on aspirin 81mg daily (as per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] contraindication
to starting). He was continued on simvastati
