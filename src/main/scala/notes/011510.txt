Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Shoulder pain/hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cathterization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 83 year old female with HTN, IDDM, CRI, and no
prior cardiac history who presents with left shoulder pain, SOB,
and chest tightness. Pt had flipped a mattress the previous
night, and experienced b/l shoulder achiness that evening. She
also had chest tightness that she associated with an ongoing
cold, and tightness was relieved with [**Last Name (un) 18774**] Vapor Rub. This am,
she thought she felt cold symptoms coming on, took a dose of
Robitussin, and proceeded to have SOB with vomiting of
clear/white phlegm, non-radiating substernal chest tightness,
and bilateral shoulder pain. Pain/SOB was not worsened or
relieved with by any factors. Patient had symptoms at rest.
There is no history of PND, orthopnea, presyncope, syncope, or
palpitations. Daughter was concerned, and called EMS. On
arrival, EMS found bs to be 404. BP was found to be 264/98. Pt
was given ASA 324mg and taken to the ED.
.
Of note, pt reports missing only her Lisinopril dose this am.
One week ago, she self titrated down her Humalog 75/25 to 42u
qam, 20u qpm, as she had been having bs in the 60s-80s. She is
followed at [**Last Name (un) **]. She has noted having decreased exercise
tolerance over the past week. She is normally very active with
her ADLs at home. Daughter is concerned that pt may be
over-exerting herself. Pt has been admitted for hypertensive
?urgency in [**6-4**] after inadvertantly holding all her BP and
insulin/anti-glycemic medications prior to cataract surgery. BP
at time of admission then had been systolic 180s, and FS
mid-300s.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T:98.2 HR:74 BP:264/98 RR:24
O2Sat:98%RA. EKG was found to have 1mm STE in avR and V1, 1-2mm
STD in II, II, V4-V6. Pt was started on a Labetalol gtt at
1mg/min and given Zofran 4mg IV x 1. CODE STEMI was activated,
and pt was received 4L O2 NC, NG 0.4mg x 3, Plavix 600mg PO x 1,
Heparin bolus 3600u IV x 1, Integrillin 11mg IV x 1, and
Morphine 2mg IV x 1, and IVF x 1L. Pain had completely resolved
from [**3-6**]->0/10 after Labetalol gtt and Morphine. Troponin was
elevated at 0.17. CXR prelim read showed mild heart failure,
with moderate cardimegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions
and bibasilar atelectasis. She was evaluated by the cardiology
fellow in the ED, and EKG was interpreted as LVH with strain
rather than acute STEMI. She was admitted to the CCU for further
evaluation and management.
.
In the CCU, pt's chest tightness had completely resolved. She
was still having some mild SOB at rest. Pain in shoulders had
also resolved.

The patient denies any palpitations or syncope,
claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or
transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit
or urinary symptoms. No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias,
myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of systems
negative.

Reports/Imaging
[**2181-2-25**] CXR: The heart size is mildly enlarged. The aorta is
tortuous. The hilar contours are normal. Small bilateral pleural
effusion and bibasilar atelectasis are noted. Mild pulmonary
vascular congestion is visualized. Severe degenerative changes
of the thoracic spine are noted. A sclerotic lesion of the right
humeral head most likely represents a bone island.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and small
bilateral pleural
effusions.

[**2181-2-26**]: ECHO The left atrial volume is increased. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with mild hypokinesis of the mid to distal inferolateral wall.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There i
