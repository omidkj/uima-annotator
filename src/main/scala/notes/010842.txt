Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

PCI x 3

History of Present Illness:
45 yo female with strong family h/o of CAD, no known CAD
presents to OSH 1 hour after experiencing intermittent but
persistent sub-sternal chest pain with radiation to elbows and
associated SOB.  Hemodynamically stable at OSH but EKG showing
ST elevations in inferior leads and ST depressions in lead 1,

Left Circumflex extending from the proximal portion of the Left
Circumflex to distal OM branches. The Left Main CA, and Right CA
had no angiographically apparent disease. LAD had 10% ostial
lesion (right dominant system).  Underwent PCIx3 with driver

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Normal
mitral valve
supporting structures. Trivial MR. Normal LV inflow pattern for
age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (ejection fraction 40-50
percent)
secondary to hypokinesis of the midventricular segment of the
inferior,
posterior, and lateral walls. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.


CATH REPORT
PTCA COMMENTS:     Initial angiography revealed a spontaneous
dissection
of the LCX extenting from the proximal vessel to the distal OM
branches.
We planned to stent this lesion to stabilize the dissection. A 6
French
XBLAD3.5 guide provided good support. A Floppy wire crossed the
lesion
with minimal difficulties and was positioned in the distal
vessel. A
3.0x24 mm Driver stent was positioned in the distal LCX and
deployed at
12 Atm. A second 3.0x24 mm Driver stent was posiitoned in the
mid vessel
in an overlapping fashion and deployed at 12 Atm. Angiography
showed
persistent dissection and a 3.0x20 mm Perfusion balloon was
inflated to
8 Atm. for four minutes in an attempt to seal the dissection.
However,
angiography remained unchanged and we then interrogated the
vessel by
intravascular ultrasound. IVUS showed excellent stent apposition
with
slight extension of the dissection proximal to the stent. We
therefore
positioned a 3.0x12 mm Driver stent extending from the LCX
ostium to the
previously stented segment and deployed at 12 Atm. Final
angiography
showed no residual stenosis, persistent intramural hematoma
throughout
the distal LCX/OM territory and TIMI 3 flow. The patient left
the lab in
stable condition.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
demonstrated
spontaneous dissection of the LCX.  LMCA, and RCA had no
angiographically apparent disease.  LAD had 10% ostial lesion
with
minimal luminal irregularities.  LCX was widely patent with
evidence of
spontaneous dissection extending from proximal LCX to distal OM
branches.  There was normal flow with no definite thrombus.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic
blood
pressure.
3. Successful stenting of the LCX with three 3.0 mm Driver
stents. Final
angiography showed no residual stenosis, persistent intramural
hematoma
in the distal LCX and normal flow (see PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Spontaneous dissection of the left circumflex artery.
2. Successful stenting of the LCX.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course by System:

A. Cardiovascular

Ischemia:  Patient suffered STEMI secondary to spontaneous
coronary dissection.  EKG changes consistent with
inferoposterior distribution (ST elevations in leads II, III,
aVF and ST depressions in I, aVL, and v1-v3.  Patient is s/p
three Driver stents.  Enzymes peaked at a CK of 1005 and
Troponin of 3.65 on Hospital Day #1, and trended down after.
Patient was discharged with prescriptions for Aspirin, Toprol
XL, Lipitor, and Plavix (Plavix will need to be continued for
one year, and possibly lifelong).  Patient was instructed to
have a re-look catherization in three weeks to assess arterial
healing, and was told to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] for long- term
management in two weeks.

Pump:  Patient's Echo results on [**2149-10-7**] showed mildly
depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection
fraction of 40-50% secondary to hypokinesis of the
midventricular segment of the inferior, posterior, and lateral
walls.  Trivial mitral regurgitation was also seen.  Patient
experienced no signs or symptoms of heart failure throughout
hospital course.

Rhythm: Patient had no issues regarding rhythm, maintaining
normal sinus rhythm.
