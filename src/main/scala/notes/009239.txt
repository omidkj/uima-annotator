Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy and intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 23410**] is a 79 yo woman with h/o diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma in the mediastinum s/p R-CHOP and R-[**Hospital1 **], s/p stent in
left main stem bronchus [**1-7**] to left main stem bronchus
compression due to mediastinal LAD, hypothyroidism, hypertension
and recent discharges from two multi day admissions for
pseudomonas pneumonia, C-diff, and work up for fever of unknown
origin who reports acute shortness of breath "late in the
evening" about four days ago at her rehab facility.  At the
time, she was sitting down with family members.  [**Name (NI) **] care givers
called 911; EMS gave patient supplemental O2, nebullizer
treatment, and taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  She reported decreased SOB
with supplemental O2.

Her ED course is as follows:  triage vitals were T97.0, HR 133,
BP 126/79, Sat 92% (unclear oxygen). She received 1g
ceftazidime, 750mg levofloxacin, and 1g vancomycin. CXR showed
near white out of the left lung, and CT confirmed left lung
collapse with opacities in the left mainstem bronchus,
consistent with mucus impaction. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for further evaluation.

Her 3 day [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course included being intubated for two
bronchoscopies that relieved the mucus plug. She had exam and
radiographs that showed her left lung to be reinflating and was
extubated on ICU day 2.  Her vital signs in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] were
notable for persistent tachycardia to 120s despite apparent
adequate volume resuscitation to include 1 unit of PRBCs.  As
for her infectious problems, she continued to be treated c-dif
vanc (finished vanc course on [**4-21**]) and pseudomonal pna
(ceftezadime and inhaled tobramycin).

She was transferred to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] in stable condition.

On review of systems, patient reported possible fevers,
productive cough, and SOB on exertion and solid stool BM on [**4-21**].

Imaging:

[**4-18**] CXR:
1. Near complete opacification of the left hemithorax, likely
representing
collapse of the left lung with a pleural effusion.
2. Small right pleural effusion, decreased from [**2137-4-14**].

[**4-18**] CT chest:
Near complete collapse of the left lung with opacities in the
left
mainstem bronchus, may reflect mucous impaction. Scattered areas
of
consolidation in the atelectatic lung. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.
Tiny pericardial effusion.

[**4-22**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-21**], there is little
overall
change. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with marked
tortuosity of the aorta is again seen. Some prominence of
interstitial markings persists and there is blunting of the
costophrenic angles with mild atelectatic changes to the bases.
