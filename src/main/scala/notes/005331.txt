extremeties antigravity (has difficulty following commands [**1-8**]
language barrier).
Tolerating pureed po intake. Foley in place.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head([**5-8**]):IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple foci of hemorrhagic contusion not significantly
changed. Minimal leftward subfalcine herniation is stable.
2. Small subdural hematoma overlying the frontal convexities
with small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Small subdural
hematoma along the right posterior cerebral convexity.
3. Nondisplaced occipital bone fracture, with associated small
posterior fossa subdural hematoma.
4. Left maxillary mucosal thickening, will a small hyperdense
focus. No discrete fracture is seen. However, if there is
clinical suspicion for a facial fracture, facial CT may be
obtained.

CT Head([**5-9**]):IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple foci of hemorrhagic contusion with intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, associated subarachnoid hemorrhage, and subdural
hematomas, all relatively unchanged. Minimal leftward subfalcine
herniation unchanged. No new intraventricular hemorrhage seen.
2. Nondisplaced occipital bone fracture, unchanged.
3. Left maxillary mucosal thickening with small hyperdense focus
unchanged.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Abnormal septal motion/position consistent with RV
pressure/volume overload.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mitral
valve annuloplasty ring. Moderate (2+) MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty
ring is present. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
