Brief Hospital Course:
Impression and plan: 84 yom with h/o CAD, CHF and MRSA PNA
admitted with dyspnea. Unclear precipitant but patient with
worsening volume overload over the past two days including
dyspnea and lower extremity edema.
.
# Respiratory distress - Likely multifactorial given h/o MRSA
PNA and CHF. CHF likely contributing to the majority of dyspnea
especially given wt gain over the past few days and CXR with
worsening Pulmonary edema.  Pt was initially intubated because
the family felt it might ease his suffering.  The pt
self-extubated but was reintubated by anaesthesia.

Hypotension- During his initial hours in the ICU, the pt's
systolic blood pressure decreased to the low 70's.  He was
started on phenylepherine to raise his blood pressure.

We discussed his course and previously stated wishes with his
family, who asked that the patient be made comfort measures
only.  His family asked that no additional changes to the
patient's medication regimen.  The patient's blood pressure fell
in the evening and his hear rate did not respond.  The patient
was pronounced at 931pm
