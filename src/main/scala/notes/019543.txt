History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 year old female with history of a heart murmur and
a diagnosis of aortic stenosis in [**2120**]. Since that time, she has
been followed by serial echocardiograms with her most recent
showing moderate to severe aortic stenosis, mild aortic
insufficiency, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, boderline
left ventricular hypertrophy and a mildly dilated left
ventricle. Her ejection fraction was low normal at 50%. Compared
to her previous echocardiogram from [**3-/2125**], her left ventricular
size had increased, the severity of her mitral regurgitation had
increased, mild pulmonary hypertension was now noted and her
ejection fraction decreased from 60% to 50%. She has noticed
recently that she becomes more fatigued with exertion. She
denies chest pain, dyspnea, lightheadedness or orthopnea. Prior
to surgical intervention, she was admitted for further
preoperative evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
[**2126-4-24**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically
significant epicardial coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD,
LCx, and RCA were without angiographically apprent flow-limiting
stenosis.
.
[**2126-4-24**] Carotid Ultrasound: There is antegrade right vertebral
artery flow. There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.
Right internal carotid artery had no stenosis. Left internal
carotid had <40% stenosis.
.
[**2126-4-25**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated
an occluded RCA and low left coronary artery with flow
visualized into the LAD, but not into the LCx.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV
free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal aortic
arch diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients.
MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve annuloplasty ring. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the basal and mid inferior segments. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). The right ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. A mitral valve annuloplasty
ring is present. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w RCA disease. Mild global right ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Head CT: [**2126-5-8**]: There is no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage, edema, large vessel territorial infarction, or shift
of normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and configuration. No acute fractures are
identified. The visualized mastoid air cells and paranasal
sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial injury.
