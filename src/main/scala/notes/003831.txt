Chief Complaint:
Angina, Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2205-5-8**]
Re-do sternotomy.
Coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with saphenous vein graft
to the right coronary artery.
Mitral valve replacement with a 25/33 On-X mechanical valve,
serial #[**Serial Number 107678**], reference #[**Serial Number 101277**].

serial #[**Serial Number 107679**], reference #[**Serial Number 42227**].


History of Present Illness:
54F with hx of CAD s/p CABG x 2, prior stents, CHF, and severe
MR referred here by her primary cardiologist for one month of
intermittent chest pain and increasing shortness of breath.
Patient states that for the past month she has had increasingly
severe DOE with occasional pre-syncopal symptoms and
light-headedness. She also describes experiencing a dull,
squeezing sensation in her chest about a month ago and since has
had intermittent sharp central chest pain that has crescendo
quality with exertion and resolves after seconds with rest. She
also describes occasional onset of chills without fevers,
3-pillow orthopnea, PND, frequent bedtime urination, and waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] LE swelling. She was to undergo coronary cath today
for evaluation primarily of her MV as she has been undergoing
outpatient planning for possible MVR but is thought to be higher
risk given her past history of bleeding (nose bleeds requiring
ED visit and cautery) and prior CABG prompting a trial of
medical management. Of note, she does not take aspirin or plavix
currently due to her history of bleeding. Her baseline
creatinine is in the high 1.0's per report but was 2.0 this AM
so his cath was deferred and she was transferred. Goal of
transfer also include coronary cath, C-[**Doctor First Name **] evaluation,
diuresis, and ACS rule-out.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.5 71 130/66 18 100%
Labs and imaging significant for negative troponin, creatinine
2.0, BNP of 2374, HCT of 33.7, UA negative, CXR c/w mild fluid
overload
ECG showed SR @ 70, NA, NI, TWI in V1-V2
Patient given Aspirin 325mg PO x 1, Hydromorphone 0.5 mg IV x 1,
humalog 14units x 1 for fingerstick of 300.
Vitals on transfer were P 66, BP: 114/93, RR: 12, 95% on RA

On arrival to the floor, patient initially feeling well and
recounting her history as above but became acutely diaphoretic,
anxious, described chest pressure and shortness of breath. Vital
signs unchanged, satting 100%RA, EKG unchanged, FSBS 54
following 1 glass of juice 10 minutes prior.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Cardiac review of systems is notable for
intermittent chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, but no palpitations,
Also denies fevers, abdominal pain, N/V/D, urinary symptoms, or
localized numbness, weakness, or tingling.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
----------------
ECG [**2205-5-2**]:
Sinus rhythm. Mild P-R interval pro0longation. RSR' pattern in
leads VI-V2 is likely a normal variant. Minor non-specific ST-T
wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2202-6-5**]
no significant changes.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**2205-5-2**]:
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged, small right pleural effusion with mild
pulmonary
edema.
.
TTE [**2205-5-3**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened and mildly retracted. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet
of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened and mildly retracted.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen (may be
significantly underestimated due to the technically suboptimal
nature of this study). There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2202-4-26**], the pulmonary artery pressure is increased.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. The multiplicity and
morphology of valve lesions suggests radiation-induced or, less
likely, rheumatic valve disease
.
L-Spine XR AP/LAT [**2205-5-3**]:
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis from
[**2199-8-1**].

There is slight scoliosis of lumbar spine convexity to the left
side centered
at L3-L4.
