Non-contrast head CT 7/7/7
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass lesion, shift
of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or infarction.
Mild confluent periventricular hypoattenuation consistent with
chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There is coarse
calcification within the visualized portion of the left
vertebral artery and basilar artery as well as cavernous carotid
arteries. The orbits are grossly unremarkable. Within the left
sphenoid sinus, there is a soft tissue density most consistent
with an inclusion cyst. There is also opacification within the
right frontal sinus which may also represent an inclusion cyst.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction.
.
Chest X-ray 7/7/7
IMPRESSION:
Small bilateral pleural effusions. Increased airspace opacities
involving the bilateral lungs represents pulmonary edema.
Radiopaque tubing projecting over the soft tissues of the
lateral right neck is of uncertain clinical significance.
Clinical correlation is requested.

Carotid Dopplers:
70-79% right ICA stenosis. Likely distal left ICA significant
stenosis.

Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>50%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion

ECG:
[**6-7**]
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. ST segment
depressions in the anterior leads suggestive of anterior
ischemia. There are also T wave inversions in the inferior
leads. Compared to the prior tracing of [**2188-6-1**] the T wave
inversions in the anterior leads are slightly less prominent


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86-year-old man with a history of atrial
fibrillation who was status post recent NSTEMI. He was admitted
for acute onset right sided weakness.  His exam was initially
notable for complete right sided hemiplegia, with aphasia and
eyes looking to left side. MRI showed acute infarction in the L
MCA distribution, likely embolic. Unfortunately, the patient
arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] 6.5 hours after he was last seen normal, making
IA tPA not possible. IV tPA had not been possible at [**Location (un) 12017**]
since he was already outside the 3 hour window. He was admitted
to the Neuro ICU for close monitoring. He was given IVF to
maintain his pressure with goal SBP 120-160. Echo was performed
that showed EF of 50% and no thrombus or ASD. Carotid U/S showed
a 70-79% stenosis in the R ICA, but no intervention was desired.
A1c was < 7, LDL was 85. His exam slowly improved. He was
maintained euglycemic and normothermic.

His Atrial fibrillation was rate-controlled with digoxin and
metoprolol.  The metoprolol dosage was increased to 37.5 mg TID
(from 25mg [**Hospital1 **]). His warfarin was held given concern for
hemorrhagic conversion of his large stroke. This should be
restarted around [**6-14**], if his fam
