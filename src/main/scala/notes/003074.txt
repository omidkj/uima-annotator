a history of breast cancer, coronary artery disease status
post myocardial infarction, peptic ulcer disease, who
presented on the date of admission with chest pain and
shortness of breath.  On route to the Emergency Department

obstructive pulmonary disease.  3.  Hypertension.  4.  Peptic

an area of 4 by 2 cm.  5.  Diverticulosis.  6.  History of
herpes zoster.  7.  Status post cholecystectomy.  8.
TAH/BSO.  9.  Rectal prolapse status post repair in [**2117-12-4**].  10.  Breast cancer, infiltrative ductal status post
surgery and radiation therapy in [**2112**].  11.  Congestive heart
failure.  12.  Question dementia.  13.  Chronic renal failure
with a baseline creatinine of 1.5 to 2.0.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Carafate, aspirin.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 mg po q.h.s., Lasix 40 mg po q day,
Imdur 30 mg po q day, Prevacid 30 mg po q.a.m., Lisinopril 10
mg po q day, Metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d., multivitamins one
q.d., Spironolactone 50 mg po q day, Mirtazapine 15 mg po
q.h.s., Zolpidem 5 mg po q.h.s.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with 24 hour
caretakers.  She is widowed.  She has occasional alcohol use.
She has a twenty pack year tobacco use, but quit in [**2111**].  No
drug use known.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.  Heart rate 80.  Blood
pressure 200/74, 30, 94% on room air.  Ill appearing female
sitting up in bed.  HEENT mucous membranes are moist.  Pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements intact.  JVD could not be assessed.
Lungs [**Year (4 digits) **] expiratory wheezes with crackles at bilateral
bases left greater then right.  Cardiovascular regular rate
and rhythm, 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left
lower sternal border.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities no pedal edema.  Dry
skin.  Neurological alert and oriented to place and time.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell 13.2, hematocrit 32.9 decreased
to 26, platelets 316.  Chem 7 136, potassium 6.2, chloride
103, bicarb 20, BUN 64, creatinine 2.6, glucose 163, INR 1.2.
Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm with a [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depression in 1, V4 through V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was
admitted for rule out myocardial infarction.  While in the
Emergency Department she was given a heparin drip.  She had a
troponin peak of 6.0 with normal CKs.  Three hours later she
was sitting on the commode and experienced left lower
extremity shaking.  Blood pressure decreased to 86/55.  She
returned to bed and then had several episodes of hematemesis.
The heparin and aspirin were discontinued.  The patient was
medically managed for her myocardial infarction with
Metoprolol.  She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
at which time her cardiovascular status remained stable.  She
did not experience any arrhythmias or episodes of congestive
heart failure.  Her diuretics were also discontinued
secondary to her volume depletion.  She remained without
congestive heart failure and was discharged to home without
her diuretics.  She had an echocardiogram, which demonstrated
an ejection fraction of 50 to 55%.  The patient was also
switched from Lisinopril to Mavic for its greater tissue
affinity and less decrease in blood pressure.

2.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient experienced hematemesis
following administration of aspirin and heparin.  The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, which was
followed by gastrointestinal.  The decision was made to
medically manage her and not do an emergent
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Recent hematocrit drop from 32
down to 26 and she was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood
cells on hospital day one.  On hospital day two her
hematocrit again took a small decrease and she was transfused
1 additional unit of packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit
then stayed stable for the next three days on Protonix only.
She did not have any further episodes of hematemesis or any
episodes of hematochezia.  She was discharged to home to have
follow up hematocrits performed.

3.  Hyperkalemia:  In the Emergency Department the patient's
potassium was noted to be 6.2.  She received calcium,
Gluconate, insulin and dextrose.  Her potassium improved and
remained stable through her admission.  This should also be
followed up in one week.

4.  Renal:  The patient's initial creatinine was 2.6 from her
baseline of 1.5 to 2.0.  This likely represented mild volume
depletion secondary to her diuretic use.  Her diuretics were
discontinued.  She was given gentle intravenous fluids.  Her
creatinine decreased to 1.8 where it remained stable.  She
was discharged off her diuretics.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non Q wave myocardial infarction.
2.  Upper GI bleed.
3.  Hyperkalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Combivent one to two puffs
inhaled q 6 hours prn.  2.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.h.s.  3.
Multivitamin one cap po q.d.  4.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.  5.
Metoprolol 25 mg po b.i.d.  6.  Mavik 2 mg po q.d.  7.  Lasix
and Aldactone were held, but may need to be reinstituted.

NOTE:  The patient is not to be given aspirin or heparin
secondary to her recurrent bleeding on these medications.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] in one
week.
