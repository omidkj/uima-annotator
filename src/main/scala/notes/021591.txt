Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Shellfish Derived

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture
Placement of right subclavian central venous line

History of Present Illness:
27M prisoner with history of oxycodone and heroin abuse,
presenting to ED after found altered in his prison cell.
Reports note that for 3 days he has been in the medical unit -
altered with slurred speech, fecal and urinary incontinence.
Also with other abnormal behaviors (talking on a pretend cell
phone).  Was noted that since 3 days prior to that (~[**12-4**]) he
has not left his cell.  Very little if any food intake x days.
Yesterday evening continued drooling, playing with his feces and
incontinent of urine.  Brought to [**Hospital3 4107**] where he was
found to have massive pneumomediastinum (seems to have been
noted on head CT before R subclavian line placement).  Also
noted to have leukocytosis to 20K.  Received 2gm ceftriaxone,
1gm vanco, and 700mg acyclovir.  Head CT normal.  LP performed
and showed 10 RBCs and 3 WBCs on tube 4.  Tox screen negative.
Flu negative.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5 P80 138/65 R30 98% RA. Patient
was given lorazepam (for shaking behaviors), unasyn, and then
zosyn, also getting fluconazole.  3L NS given.  Thoracics
consulted.  CXR showed subclavian CVL crossing midline, line
then pulled back.  Barium swallow showing no evidence of leak
(but anterior wall not fully evaluated).  Thoracics not
suspicious of line or esophagus as cause, think more likely to
be related to ?lingular bleb seen on CT.  Thoracics recommended
high flow O2, zosyn and fluconazole.  Also recommend CT
esophagram with Optiray contrast once barium has passed below
diaphragm.
.
On the floor, patient denies pain or specific complaints.
Tremulous.  Does endorse shortness of breath when asked.  Denies
headache or neck stiffness or chest pain.


Past Medical History:
- Polysubstance abuse - endorses recent (10 days ago) oxycodone
use - snorting.  Endorses history of IVDU - heroin.  Endorses
rare marijuana use and cigarette smoking.  Denies EtOH use.
- Bipolar disorder
- Anxiety/panic attacks treated with benzos
- Girlfriend reports patient abuses heroin, oxycodone, cocaine,
marijuana, and that he takes up to 50mg Xanax per day.

Social History:
- Tobacco: Occasional smoker.
- Alcohol: Rare per patient
- Illicits: As above.
- Arrested and incarcerated 10 days ago.  Prior was living with
his fiancee [**Doctor First Name **] and his 2 year old son.

Neuro: Lethargic but easily arousable.  Keeps eyes open only
slightly then closes.  Speech slowed, ?slurred, does not open
mouth wide as above.  Oriented to 26th, hospital.  Knows 1.75 is
7 quarters.  Tremulous at rest and more with motions ?spasticity
vs. true rigidity .  Strength 5/5 in uppers and lower
extremities, though fatigues very easily with dorsiflexion, less
so with plantarflexion.  Sensory grossly intact but poor
participation.  2+ DTRs at [**Name2 (NI) 84351**] and patellae.

Imaging:
CT head at OSH: no bleed, hydrocephalus, or mass effect.  Tiny
hypodense foci consistent with infarcts, some old and some age
indeterminate due to small size.  Subcutaneous emphysema in
visualized pharynx.

CT chest at OSH: Subcutaneous emphysema from skull base to
mediastinum.  Some foci between the mediastinum and medial
pleura.  One focus posterior to the sternum and anteromedial to
the pleura bilaterally.  Otherwise no pneumothorax.  No
mediastinal shift.  Lungs clear.

CXR at OSH: right subclavian line crosses midline to terminate
in LEFT brachicephalic vein.  Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous
air.

Imaging at [**Hospital1 18**]:

EKG: sinus tach at 96, NANI, QRS 80, QTc 455.  No ST changes.

[**2112-12-10**]: Esophagram: No evidence of contrast leakage.
Technically limited study due to suboptimal positioning given
patient's mental status.

[**2112-12-10**] CT Chest:
1. Extensive pneumomediastinum extending into the neck and
abdomen.
2. There is NO extraluminal contrast from the upper GI performed
earlier
today. Small amount of intraluminal contrast is identified.
3. No mediastinal hematoma. Right paratracheal fluid and gas
accounts for
the medial right apical pulmonary opacity identified on chest
radiographs.

[**2112-12-11**] EEG:
This is a mildly abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy
states due to a mildly slow and disorganized background
consisting mostly of theta frequencies. This may be secondary to
a marked drowsiness or encephalopathy or may be suggestive of a
meningitic process. There were no epileptiform features or focal
or lateralized abnormalities.

[**2112-12-11**] CT Head: No acute intracranial pathology.

[**2112-12-11**] CT Chest:
1. No evidence of esophageal injury.
2. Extensive pneumomediastinum, not significantly changed from
prior.

[**2112-12-14**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Low inferior lead T wave amplitude
is non-specific and tracing may be within normal limits.
Unstable baseline makes assessment difficult.  Since the
previous tracing of [**2112-12-10**] there is probably no significant
change  but unstable baseline on both tracings makes comparison
difficult.

[**2112-12-14**] CT Abdomen and Pelvis: 1. Normal appendix. 2. Bilateral
symmetric perinephric fluid is unusual in a patient of this age
and of unclear etiology and clinical significance. 3.
Pneumomediastinum, partially imaged.
