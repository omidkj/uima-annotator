Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old female with hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia who
was trasferred from [**Hospital3 4107**] for ?NSTEMI and cardiac
cath.  Patient is scheduled for hip surgery in the near future.
She had donated blood in preparation for surgery several days
ago. Since that time, she has been feeling "unwell" with
fatigue, nausea, small amounts of vomiting, back pain and a
"pounding chest".  She saw her PCP this morning and troponin
came back at 3.13. EKG showed mild lateral ST elevations so she
was sent to the ED.   She was given Aspirin 325mg and Heparin IV
gtt was started.  SBP was mildly low in the 90's, and she was
given a bolus of Normal Saline.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for cardiac cath, which showed clean coronaries but likely
Takutsobo's cardiomyopathy.  Given her marginal blood pressures
and significant anemia, she was transferred to the CCU for
further management.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient was chest pain free.  She
denies any palpitations, diaphoresis, SOB, N/V or diarrhea.  She
states that she feels well and has no complaints

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, surgery, cough,
hemoptysis, or red stools. She does report black stools since
starting Ferrous Sulfate.  She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors.  All of the other review of systems were negative.

EKG [**2189-3-5**] ([**Hospital1 **]): Sinus Tachycardia, 1mm STE V5-V6

CXR [**2189-3-5**] ([**Hospital1 **] report):
The heart size is within normal limits. The lungs are clear.
There is no pleural fluid or PTX.

CARDIAC CATH [**2189-3-5**]:
LMCA: Normal
LAD: Normal
LCx: Normal
RCA: Normal
-- LV apical akinesis consistent with Takutsobo's
Cardiomyopathy.  Elevated right and left heart filling pressures
with preserved cardiac output. Marked anemia. RVEDP 4, PCWP 15,
LVEDP 15

TTE [**2189-3-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the mid-LV segments and akinesis of the distal segments and
apex. The basal LV segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No outflow tract obstruction. Moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. No LV thrombus seen.

In absence of obstructive coronary artery disease, these
findings are consistent with Takotsubo-type cardiomyopathy. If
clinically indicated, recommend a repeat study in [**2-23**] weeks to
reassess wall motion abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 70 year old female with hx of HTN who was trasferred
from [**Hospital3 4107**] for ?NSTEMI and cardiac cath, which showed
clean coronaries and likely Takutsobo's.

# Takutsobo's Cardiomyopathy:  On admission, the patient had a
troponin elevation and lateral ECG changes concerning for ACS.
However her cardiac cath showed clean coronary arteries and an
LV gram consistent with Takutsobo's CMP.  Echo showed apical
akinesis also consistent with the diagnosis.  The patient's
recent stress and blood donation in preparation of her upcoming
surgery likely precipitated the illness.  As the patient has an
allergy to ACE-I, this was not initiated.  She had at first some
low blood pressures so beta blocker were also held initially.
She was able to be started on low dose carvedilol and valsartan,
without any documented adverse reaction.  She was monitored
overnight for cardiogenic shock and remained stable in the CCU.
She was transferred to the cardiology floor.  She was also
initiated on warfarin for the risk of thrombus with apical
akinesis.  She will follow up with a new outpatient
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10543**], for repeat echo in [**12-23**] weeks, as this
etiology is typically transient.  At that time it will be
determined if she needs to continue on anticoagulation therapy.
In the meantime, she was instructed to continue ASA, coumadin,
carvedilol and valsartan, as well as stick to a low salt diet.

# Anemia:  HCT 23.5 s/p cardiac cath, unknown baseline.  Anemia
was likely [**12-22**] recent blood donation and s/p cardiac cath along
with hemodilution from IVF given at OSH.  Given recent troponin
leak, patient was transfused two units pRBCs.  Afterwards her
Hct remained stable.

# Hypotension: Patient with SBP of 90 on admission.  Likely her
blood pressure was low in the setting of Takutsobo's CMP.  She
was given two units pRBCs as above. Held beta blockers and ACE
inhibitors as above, but able to start carvedilol and valsartan.
