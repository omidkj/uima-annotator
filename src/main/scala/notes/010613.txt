Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2116-1-1**]:
Bilateral right greater than left acute-on-chronic subdural
hematomas with
1cm shift of midline structures to left.

CT Head [**2116-1-2**]:
1. Status post right craniotomy with unchanged residual
bilateral subdural
hemorrhages, right greater than left, and stable 4-mm midline
shift. Layering components of acute hemorrhage are unchanged in
size and appearance.
2. Unchanged free ossific lesion in right subdural space.

CT Head [**2116-1-9**]:
Bilateral right greater than left subdural hematomas with
varying
densities, overall unchanged in size since [**2116-1-7**]. There is
decrease in
pneumocephalus as well as slight decrease in leftward shift of
the normally midline structures. Despite this, there remains
mild leftward subfalcine herniation and moderate-to-severe
sulcal effacement along the right cerebral hemisphere.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35694**] was taken tot he OR with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2116-1-1**] for a
right craniotomy for SDH. He was extubated and trasnfered to the
SICU for close neurologic monitoring. Post-op imaging showed
pneumocephalus and post-operative changes. On [**2116-1-2**] he was
lethargic and was not briskly following commands. Repeat imaging
was stable. Oxygen via a nonrebreather was ordered for the
pneumocephalus and his head of bed was kept at <30 degrees. The
ICU started zyprexa for agitation with good effect. Serial Chest
X-rays suggested that there may be a chronic interstitial lung
disease versus and acute pulmonary proocess. CT imaging fo the
chest was defered at this time. The 5 day course of Zithromycin
was continued. On [**1-3**] he was more verbal and appropriate. The
nonrebreather was discontinued. His HOB was liberalized. His
neuro check were made Q2hrs.

On [**1-4**], his exam was stable and he was transfered to floor
afetr a repeat head CT.
On [**1-6**] he was seen by the speech and swallow service and they
recommended a continued pureed [**Month/Day (4) **]. during the early morning of
[**1-7**] he had an episode of desaturation to 83% with noted tongue
edema. This imporved with placement of a nasal trumpet. At 0930
his saturation was 95-97% on Humidified O2. His zyprexa was
changed to seroquel in hopes of better effect for his agitation.


A chest CT showed no evidence of acute PNA, but interstitial
changes that might be
consistent with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Bibasilar
atelectasis. Patient has no fever or increase in WBC. Exam was
improved on nasal trumpet.

On [**1-9**] the patient was much more alert and interactive. His
nasal trumpet was removed and his respiratory status was stable.
He was screened for rehab. The foley was removed in the am of
[**1-10**]. A repeat speech and swallow evaluation was done and his
[**Month/Day (1) **] was advanced to soft solids. He was transferred to a rehab
facility on [**2116-1-10**].
