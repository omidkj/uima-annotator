Date of Birth:  [**2123-10-15**]             Sex:   F

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Baclovent

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; liver masses

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-12-19**]: Right hepatic trisegmentectomy, cholecystectomy, portal
vein thrombectomy, intraoperative ultrasound.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 23 year old female with no significant past medical
history presenting with subacute GI process over past 3 months.
In [**2146-8-19**], she noted intermittent nausea and vomiting,
about 2-3 times per week, usually worse in the morning, prior to
eating. About 1 month prior to admission, these symptoms have
worsened in frequency and severity with daily nausea and
vomiting associated with diarrhea up to 3-4 times / day.
Appetite is present however her PO intake has dramatically
decreased over the past month. She has lost about [**3-28**] lbs over
the past three months. She did admit to intermittent fevers and
intermittent night sweats. She has also noted yellowish stool,
looser in consistency; urine color unchanged. Over the past two
weeks she's had increasing lethargy and confusion; on the day
prior to admission, her parents stated that she did not come
down for breakfast and they found her upstairs in bed, sleeping
late into the morning and confused upon arousal. She was too
lethargic to make it down the stairs. Given progressive
lethargy, worsening nausea/vomiting and diarrhea, and confusion,
she was brought to the hospital for evaluation. In the ED, her
vitals were noted to be stable with electrolytes within normal
limits. INR was elevated to 1.5 and PTT was elevated at 41.2.
Transaminases were mildly elevated. Outside hospital CAT scan of
abdomen was reviewed which showed multiple liver masses
suggestive for focal nodular hyperplasia versus hepatic adenoma,
hemangioendothelioma, or fibrolamellar carcinoma. Expansion of
the right portal vein likely secondary to tumor thrombus was
noted with thrombus seen in the proximal portal vein. She was
pain-free and nausea free, although mildly confused. She was
transferred to the floor for in-patient evaluation.

Imaging:
[**2146-12-14**] Liver ultrasound with duplex - IMPRESSION:
Multiple hepatic masses involving majority of the right lobe as
seen on the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] CT. Expansile hyperechoic vascularized
tumor thrombus is
present within the proximal main portal vein extending into the
right and left portal system with cavernous transformation noted
in the portal hilum. A portion of the left portal vein is not
involved by tumor thrombus.

The presence of tumor thrombus is highly suggestive of an
underlying malignancy with differential again including
fibrolamellar HCC, conventional HCC, malignant
hemangioendothelioma, or given GI symptoms atypical appearance
of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. Malignant degeneration of
adenomas is also possible.

[**2146-12-14**] CT chest without contrast - IMPRESSION:
1. No suspicious lesions concerning for malignant disease in the
chest.
2. Right lower lobe subpleural density, adjacent to an area of
scarring,
likely a granuloma.
3. Two large liver masses, better evaluated on dedicated
abdominal imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 72714**] is a 23 year old female who presented after
several months of nausea and vomitting, found to have subacute
hepatic failure due to fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma
with associated portal vein tumor thrombus.  She received right
lobe US guided biopsy that confirmed fibrolamellar HCC on
[**2146-12-14**].  CT and MRI were completed which did not show
metastatic lesions and MRI did not show cerebral edema.  She
received left lobe liver biopsy [**2146-12-16**] that showed severe
macrosteatosis likely secondary to prolonged malnutrition.  She
was promptly started on TPN [**2146-12-16**] after left liver biopsy
results were obtained. She was started on a heparin drip [**2146-12-17**]
to prevent tumor propagation. She was transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1369**]
hepatobiliary surgical service [**2146-12-17**] in preparation for triple
lobectomy and portal vein thrombectomy on [**2146-12-19**].

She was taken to the operating room on [**2146-12-19**] for a right
hepatic trisegmentectomy,
cholecystectomy, and portal vein thrombectomy with
intraoperative ultrasound.   Please refer to the operative note
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for additional details.  She received a total of
8000 mL of plasmalyte, 1250 mL of albumin, 3 units of fresh
frozen plasma, 16 units of packed red cells, 1 unit of cryo and
made 1530 mL of urine intraoperatively.  She tolerated the
procedure well but due to the extensive nature of the resection
she was returned to the surgical ICU post-operatively.

She received an additional 2 units of PRBC overnight on POD 0
into POD 1 and was briefly on neosynephrine to maintain her
blood pressure.  On POD 1, she was off pressors,
cardiovascularly stable (no additional blood products) and was
extubated.
Her diet was advanced and she was transferred to the floor on
POD 2 tolerating clears.

The remainder of her post-operative course was largely
uncomplicated.  Pertinents, by system:

Neuro: After receiving intermittent fentanyl and propofol in the
ICU, she was on intermittent IV dilaudid in the initial days
following the operation and subsequently transitioned to oral
dilaudid which she tolerated well.  There was initial concern of
oversedation and the patient voluntarily agreed to decrease
dosing.  Her sedation was not an issue
