History of Present Illness:
52 year old man with recent stroke ([**5-/2124**]), htn, hepC, obesity,
and asthma presented to dentist this am and noted to have high
blood pressure. Sent to PCP who noted 203/119 who sent to ED for
further eval. He complains of a headache, [**10-16**] frontal with
photophobia, which he has had every day for approximately 1
month since starting his current regimen of BP meds. He reports
taking his medications this morning, but does seem confused as
to his current regimen. He last skipped his meds last week and
denies a headache that day. Daily headaches also associated with
blurry vision and photophobia. Denies chest pain or shortness of
breath. Mild nausea and feeling 'lightheaded'. No new
numbness/paresthesia. He does describe left sided leg weakness
which he describes as 'like I'm dragging my foot'. He is unsure
how long this weakness has lasted, possibly a few weeks. Does
describe residual rt sided weakness from previous stroke along
with dysarthria.

In the ED inital vitals were, Pain 10 T: 97.9 P: 68 BP: 159/111
RR: 16 96% RA. EKG and non-contrast head CT were negative for
acute changes. Retinal exam was difficult and papilledema could
not be evaluated. Patient was given compazine and benadryl for
headache and started on nitroprusside drip for BP. VS on
transfer were 84 174/86 24 95%RA.

- Hypertension, on four agents, several years standing
- Hepatitis C, chronic (per Atrius records, positive serology in
[**2116**])
- Overweight
- Chest pain
- Sleep apnea, untreated
- Asthma
- Prior depression
- Possible dyslipidemia - patient unsure
- Left pontine stroke [**5-/2124**] with mild rt sided weakness and
dysmetria
- multiple left rib fractures with hemothorax [**2124-6-27**]

Social History:

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old man with history of difficult to control HTN and
stroke in [**5-/2124**] presenting with hypertensive urgency.

1) Hypertensive urgency: The patient presented with SBP's in the
200s and with headache and left leg weakness rising concern for
hypertensive emergency.  Therefore, after a benign head CT he
was started on a nitroprusside drip and home medication.  With
these treatments his SBP rapidly fell into the 110's and
nitroprusside drip was stopped soon after transfer to ICU.
Eventually, further review of outpatient notes and discussion
with the patient revealed that both headache and leg weakness
had a much more subacute course leading to more likely diagnosis
of hypertensive urgency.  SBP's remained less than 170 for
remainder of hospitalization and he never had chest pain,
shortness of breath, signs of acute kidney injury or any
indication of acute end organ damage.

2) Hypertension, malignant: Patient with long history of
difficult to control blood pressure.  Reasons for this episode
unclear though in describing medication taking at home patient
did acknowledge some confusion about taking his regimen and
admitted intermittent unintentional non-adherence.  Discussion
with PCP also suggestive of episodes of non-adherence but
occasionally with quite poor control even in the context of good
adherence.  He was initially put on his home regimen but given
issues with headache an attempt was made to stop his nitrate. To
attempt to get increased blood pressure benefit without adding
agents to already relatively [**Name2 (NI) 40369**] regimen HCTZ was converted to
Chlorthalidone and Triamterene to spironolactone.  On
amlodipine, losartan, spironolactone, chlorthalidone, and
labetalol SBP's remained <150 for an entire day.  The following
day attempted to remove amlodipine to further simplify regimen
but this led to increased blood pressures so amlodipine
restarted and he was discharged on this five drug regimen to
follow up with his PCP next week.  Regarding work-up for
secondary causes of HTN renal artery doppler exam was benign,
cortisol level normal, renin, aldosterone, and metanephrine
levels were also checked and are pending at time of discharge.

3) Headache: This was initially attributed to hypertension but
persisted in attenuated form after BPs significantly improved
and apparently has persisted for a month.  Given association of
nitrates with headache isosorbide was stopped with some further
improvement in headache.  Pt reports headache anterior,
bilateral, sometimes associated with nausea and photophobia
raising concern for migraine.  He received acetaminophen and had
a very good response to a single dose of fioricet.  He will
discuss possible future neurology follow up with his PCP.

4) Left sided weakness: Per review of atrius notes and patient
reports appears to have gone on for weeks. Very mild and
appeared to improve over course of hospitalization.  The patient
reports a previous MVA and back injury which could potential
lead to a spinal process causing independent leg weakness.  Does
not seem consistent with acute stroke and head CT without bleed.
  Patient will discuss in follow up with his PCP.

5) History of cerebrovascular disease: Pt with history of CVA in
[**5-/2124**] with persistent very mild right sided weakness and
dysarthria. He
