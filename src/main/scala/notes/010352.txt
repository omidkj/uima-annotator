History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 21883**] is an 84-year-old man with a history of CABGx4 in [**2185**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,  SVG-Diag, SVG-RCA), chronic systolic CHF (EF
35% with ICD placed in [**2194**]), severe AS (area 0.6 cm2, gradient
33 mmHg, s/p valvuloplasty in [**5-/2197**]), who was transferred from
OSH for acute heart failure exacerbation in the setting of
severe AS. The patient presented to [**Location (un) 11248**] Hospital in New
[**Location (un) **] on [**2198-1-1**] with acute abdomen. Abd CT revealed
dilated small bowel with wall thickening. Seen by surgery, with
a working diagnosis of perforated diverticulum even though no
definite diverticulum was seen on imaging. Pt was treated with
IVF and pip-tazo. He then developed congestive heart failure
with troponin rising to 17.0. Echo at OSH showed EF of 25% with
critical AS with valve area 0.6 cm2 and moderate AI. He was
treated with BiPAP. The discharge summary mentioned usage of
"dopamine" at one point but patient was not on pressor on
transfer. Given that his prior valvuloplasty was done at [**Hospital1 18**],
he was transferred here for further management.

CARDIOLOGY:
TTE (1/3/9)
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls
and hypokinesis of the mid to distal septum. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary
disease. Elevated left ventricular filling pressure. Severe
aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.

.
RADIOLOGY:
.
RUQ U/S ([**2198-1-6**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post cholecystectomy.
2. No biliary ductal dilatation.
.
.
CT A/P ([**2198-1-10**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Small contained fluid collection measuring 2.8 cm within the
mid abdomen abutting an adjacent loop of small bowel. No
surrounding stranding is identified to suggest an acute
inflammatory process. This had not changed since the prior CTs
from Lakes Regional General. Differential includes fluid filled
diverticulum, duplication cyst, though infectious etiology
cannot be ruled out based on imaging. The location within the
mesentery does not appear amenable to percutaneous image-guided
biopsy.
2. Severe aortic valve calcifications with dilated left
ventricular chamber size.
3. Mildly enlarged subcarinal lymph node.
4. Sigmoid colon diverticulosis.
5. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic plaque within the
abdominal aorta,
iliac branches and common femoral arteries.
6. Small amount of air within the bladder. Please correlate with
Foley
catheter placement.
7. Extensive degenerative changes within the lower lumbar spine
in which
further evaluation with MRI may be obtained as indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 21883**] is an 84yo M w CAD (s/p CABGx4), chronic sys CHF (s/p
ICD, EF 35% in [**1-/2198**]), severe AS (area 0.6 cm2, gradient 33
mmHg, s/p valvuloplasty in [**5-/2197**]), who originally p/w to OSH w
acute abdomen was found to have a possible small bowel
perforation, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for acute CHF
exacerbation [**2-5**] severe AS in the setting of small bowel
perforation, s/p intubation for respiratory failure.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Likely [**2-5**] from pulmonary edema from
acute systolic CHF exacerbation. Pt was intubated and on
mechanical ventilation for hypoxemia. Condition improved w
diuresis/antibiotics and pt was successfully weaned from the
ventilator and extubated without problems. On discharge pt is
oxygenating in the mid-to upper 90s on RA.
.
# PUMP: acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation with
pulmonary edema [**2-5**] AS, leading to respiratory failure requiring
intubation. TTE at OSH showed LVEF = 25%, repeat TTE with
improvement to LVEF of 35-40% at [**Hospital1
