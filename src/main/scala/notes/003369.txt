History of Present Illness:
67F with hx of CRI (bl cr 1.4), Crohn's, pancreatic
insufficiency and multiple UTIs presents from rehab with
complaints of fever and hypotension. Per the pt, she has been in
rehabs since her discharge on [**2106-9-8**]. She was in her USOH until
two days ago when she developed increased frequency of bowel
movements, up to 6x/day from a baseline of 2x/day. She noted
that the bowel movements were "liquidy" unlike her usual formed
stools and denied abdominal pain, hematochezia or melena. She
also noted chills but denied subjective fever. She stated she
had not had cough, sob, cp, or dysuria. However she did note
that during previous episodes of UTI she had always been without
symptoms. She also noted that she uses pampers diapers because
she sometimes has difficulty making it to the toilet, this has
especially been the case in the last couple of days when she has
been having bowel frequency.
.
Per the Rehab facility, two days ago the pt was confused and so
she was sent for stat labs. Today the pt was complaining of
weakness, and found to have T 100.4, pulse 107 bp 98/58 rr 18
92%RA, fsg 132. The labs returned showing WBC 14.3, Cr 2.5, and
a u/a that was cloudy, 1+ LE, 6 wbc. UCx showed 10k-30k Gram
Positive species. Given this picture, the decision was made to
send the pt to the ED.
.
In the ED the pt was found to be 99.5 82 73/45 24 100%
Non-Rebreather. She had a CBC showing WBC 14.8, Cr 2.6 from
baseline 1.2, u/a with trace leuks and few bacteria, CXR without
acute process. Trop 0.07. CT abd without evidence of colitis. A
RIJ was placed, the pt was given 3L NS with improvement in BP to
100s/70s, and vanc, zosyn and flagyl. Systolics returned to the
80s so the pt was started on levophed 0.03 and transferred to
the ICU.
.
On the floor, the pt was 96 108/54 (on levo) 75 100%2Lnc. She
denied any pain but did endorse some confusion. She states that
she had some diarrhea for the preceding few days and chills. The
pt had a bm which was very loose and had 4 red capsules were
found in it. She had repeat labs which showed wbc 12.9, hct
25.9, cr 2.0.

Brief Hospital Course:
67F with CAD, DM2, CKD, Crohn's, pancreatic insufficiency, and
muliple urinary tract infections presents from rehab with
complaints of fever and hypotension.
.
# Septic shock: The patient presented from rehab with fever,
altered mental status and hypotension. She was found to have
SBPs in the 70s refractory to 3L IVF boluses and requiring
levophed gtt to maintain MAPs >60. Fever was documented at up to
103. Wbc was 14 on presentation, with creatinine 2.6 (up from
baseline 1.4).
.
The source of infection was unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] cultures were
negative. Urine culture from rehab grew 10-30K GPCs (never
speciated). CXR was unremarkable. CT abdomen/pelvis showed only
epiploic appendigitis. C. diff toxin and PCR were negative.
Nonetheless, the patient was
