Brief Hospital Course:
After transfer in from outside hospital he  underwent
preoperative work up.  On [**10-31**] he was brought to the Operating
Room and underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  See
operative report for further details.  Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin was used for surgical
antibiotic prophylaxis given the inpatient stay of greater than
24 hours preop.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.

The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  He is diabetic, and Lantus was titrated to home dose
as tolerated.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the Physical
Therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home with VNA in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
