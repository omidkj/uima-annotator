Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 29 yo M with h/o of bipolar disorder, anxiety, and
depression now admitted for UGIB.
.
# UGIB: Patient reported vomitting blood prior to admission. NG
lavage in the ED showed red/pink blood that GI and the ICU team
thought was due to NG trauma or other benign process. The
patient remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrits
throughout his stay in the ED and the ICU. Furthermore, he had
no further episodes of hemetemisis during admission. He was
initially started on a protonix gtt in the ED which was changed
to protonix IV BID while in house. GI was consulted and felt
that the patient was currently stabile and no urgent EGD was
indicated at this time. However, nonurgent endoscopy is
indicated and out-patient coordination for this procedure should
be arranged with the patient and his out-patient care providers.
Of course, the patient should avoid NSAIDS and ETOH and was
advised to do so until an out-patient EGD can be performed.
.
# Psych issues with SI/HI: He presented with intermittent
agitation and symptoms of depression. The patient was evaluated
by psychiatry who felt it is unclear if he has underlying
primary psychiatric or mood disorder, but certainly meets
criteria for antisocial personality disorder. While patient was
hospitalized, he was given lyrica, carbamazepime, ziprasidone,
Chlorpromazine x 1, and ativan x 1. He was also treated with
zyprexa 10 mg IM twice for agitation and aggressive behavior,
including threatening comments and one episode in which he
physically struck a staff member. During his hospitalization he
had a 1:1 sitter and security. Patient did not require
restraints. He did intermittently endorse SI and HI, and
Psychiatry felt it appropriate that he return to [**Hospital1 1680**] House
for on-going, in-patient psychiatric care.
.
# EtoH abuse: Patient's last drink was more than 5 days prior to
admission and therefore it was determined that CIWA was not
indicated at this time. Patient was given folate, thiamine, MVI.

.
# Asthma/bronchitis: Patient was continued on flovent,
ipratropium, albuterol nebs and montelukast. His bactrim was
discontinued.
.
# Back/leg pain: Patient was continued on methocarbamol and
lyrica. His gabapentin was stopped.
.
transitional issues:
- patient will need outpatient endoscopy
- patient's psychiatric medications may need further adjustments

- if/when he is re-hospitalized, staff should be very careful
given his history of violent behavior, including physically
striking a staff member during this hospitalization.
