Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, fever, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Debridement of sacral ulcers

History of Present Illness:
   This is a 52 yo male with multiple medical problems including
ESRD s/p failed renal transplant on HD, DM, HTN, recurrent UTIs
with VRE and resistant proteus who presented to OSH with fevers,
myalgias, and fatigue.  He was found to be hypotensive with
presumed urosepsis and was started on Vanc/Gent/Linezolid/Ceftaz
and on Neo.  During the hospitalization, he developed CP
radiating to the jaw with ECG changes and elevated CK (600) and
Trop I (28).  Pt was started on heparin but cardiac
catheterization was deferred pending stabilization from
urosepsis.  Pt experienced a second episode of CP which was
relieved with NTG, but with new lateral ST depressions. At this
time, a combination of cardiogenic and septic shock was
suspected and a TTE was done, showing new global HK w/ EF 30%,
ant/[**Month (only) **]/apical HK, worsening AS, severe PA HTN, dilated RV, and
severe TR. Pt was started on Dopamine instead of Neo, placed on
Heparin, ASA, Plavix, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.

1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant
system
with left main and three vessel CAD.  The distal left main
tapered to a
80% stenosis.  The LAD had a 90% ostial lesion.  The remainder
of the
LAD had mild luminal irregularities.  The LCx had a 80% ostial
lesion.
A major OM2 branch had a 70% lesion in the mid vessel.  The RCA
was
occluded proximally.  The distal vessel filled via collaterals
from the
left coronary artery and bridging collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right sided
filling
pressures with a mean RA pressure of 12 mm Hg and moderately
elevated
left sided filling pressures with a mean PCW pressure of 22 mm
Hg.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension was present.  Cardiac index was
near the
upper limits of normal (based on an assumed oxygemn consumption
index)
with a reduced system vascular resistance.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. A 7 French 30 cc intra-aortic balloon pump was successfully
placed
via the right common femoral artery.  This provided diastolic
augmentation of blood pressure and systolic unloading of the
ventricle.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Low systemic vascular resistance.
4. Successful placement of a 7 French 30 cc intra-aortic balloon
pump.

COMMENTS:
  1. Coronary angiography of this right-dominant circulation
showed
severe 3-vessel CAD. The LMCA had a distal 90% stenosis. The LAD
had an
ostial 90% stenosis. The LCX had an ostial 90% lesion and a 90%
mid
vessel stenosis. The RCA was totally occluded proximally.
  2. Resting hemodynamics showed normal central aortic blood
pressure.
  3. Unsuccessful PCI of the RCA.
  4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the LMCA into the LAD and
LCX
ostium with two double-barrel 3.0 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent,
which
were post-dilated to 3.5 mm. Final angiography showed no
residual
stenosis, no dissection and normal flow.
  5. Successful stenting of the mid LCX with a 3.0 mm Cypher
drug-eluting stent. Final angiography showed no residual
stenosis, no
dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
  6. The left common femoral arteriotomy site was closed with an
8
French Angioseal with good hemostasis.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Unsuccessful PCI to the RCA.
3. Successful stenting of the LMCA into the LAD and LCX.
4. Successful LCX stenting.

"[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
52 year old man with ESRD and left upper extremity fistula, now
with LUE edema.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please assess for vascular flow in LUE, and flow through
fistula.
INDICATION: Left upper extremity edema. Known history of
end-stage renal disease, and left upper extremity fistula.
COMPARISON: None.
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY DVT STUDY: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**]
of the left internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, brachial
vein, and basilic veins were obtained. Normal flow, augmentation
and compressibility and wave forms are demonstrated. The left
basilic vein is not well-visualized but appears patent without
any evidence of thrombus. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified.
The left upper extremity AV fistula was patent."
