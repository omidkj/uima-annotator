Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o F with CAD, COPD and respiratory failure was s/p trach
wean with persistent tracheocutaneous air leak who presented for
elective takedown of tracheocutaneous fistula, PACU course
complicated by diffuse neck and face swelling [**2-22**] subcutaneous
emphysema.  Was transferred to the ICU for monitoring.  Over the
course of the evening, her subcutaneous emphysema slightly
improved.  At approximately 3am she developed acute respiratory
distress and 02 sats in the 60s-70s.  Her hypoxia did not
respond to a non-rebreather and a code blue was called for
emergent intubation.  Initially, her skin sutures were taken
down to see if she could be re-trached, but the tracheocutaneous
fistula was too small.  She was then intubated orally, but this
was difficult given tracheomalacia.  After being sedated with
fentanyl and midazolam she became hypotensive 50s/30s.  She was
started on neosynepherine and her pressure responded
appropriately and she was weaned down.  A central line was
placed and propofol was given for sedation.  Again she became
hypotensive and was started on neo which was weaned after 24
hours.  She woke up, was alert and oriented, responded
appropriately and had no focal neurological signs.  However, she
was difficult to oxygenate, on PEEP of 16 and Fi02 of 60-90%.
She remained intubated to allow the trach site to heal and was
weaned Fi02 to 40% and PEEP to 5.  She did not have cuff leak
during SBTs.  She was also actively diuresed with lasix due to
CHF history and BNP 1800. She was followed by ENT and
interventional pulmonolgy who plan to extubate her in the OR
under direct visualization.
She spiked fever to 100.9 on POD2, and was started on
vancomycin.  Her blood cultures were positive for MRSA and her
incsision started producing purulent discharge that also grew
out MRSA.  After starting Vanco treatment, repeat blood cultures
had no growth to date.
She spiked a fever again on POD3, had increased secretions and
possibly worsening RLL infiltrate on CXR.  She was started on
Zosyn for concern for VAP and history of Pseudomonas (sensitive
to zosyn).  Mini-BAL grew coagulase postive staph aureus.  Zosyn
was discontinued after blood culture did not grow out gram
negative rods or Pseudomonas on POD6.  She did not have
leukocytosis and she remained hemodynamically stable.  The
patient had daily CXR, which showed atelectasis and no evidence
of PNA.  Her subcutaneous emphysema continued to improve after
intubation and facial swelling and upper toro crepitus resolved
prior to discharge.
After weaning down to minimal vent settings and having adequate
oxygen saturations, the patient was extubated at bedside with
anesthesia and respiratory therapy present to assist.  Extubated
was well tolerated and occurred without events on POD8.  Patient
was placed on BiPAP overnight and had desaturation to 88% in
early morning of POD9, which warrented increasing oxygen.
Saturations improved to 93% once oxygen was increased.  Pt
reports regular desats at home on CPAP.  In the morning pt was
placed on 2L NC and was sating >90%.  Diet was advanced and
patient tolerated advancing diet.  Patient is being discharged:
afebrile, tolerating regular diet without nausea/vomiting, pain
well controlled on oral medication, voiding, and ambulating
well.   Patient will follow-up in [**7-31**] days with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], and PCP.
