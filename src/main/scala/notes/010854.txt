Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP positive pressure ventilation
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
72F with history of severe COPD on home o2 2L NC, restrictive
lung disease with probable obesity hypoventilation, CAD s/p MI,
CHF (EF~25% in [**2201**]) presenting from facility after desaturation
to the 70[**Hospital **] transferred to MICU for continued management of
hypoxia.

Per report, patient with acute onset SOB since 530am. VS 96.8
100  22  126/63 02 78%. Placed on facemask with O2 improving to
94-96%. Transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. Spoke with [**Last Name (un) **] house; per nurse
patient had been in USOH over preceding weeks with stable
weights, no increasing O2 requirement. No productive cough,
fever, wheeze. Baseline VS: 120s-150s, HRs: 80s-90s in sinus.
Patient did have a CXR on [**2-29**] which was consistent with mild
vascular congestion and lasix was increased from 60mg QD to 80mg
QD x5days; since then has returned to standing 60mg dose.

In the ED,  initial VS: 83 108/55 72%RA. ABG: 7.39/51/67/32, on
FiO2%:30; Rate:/32; TV:350; PEEP:5. CXR consistent with pulm
edema but can't rule out underlying pna. Patient received
levo/ctx, lasix 40mg IV. UOP >500cc after 40mg IV lasix. After
intervention 95-97% and symptomatically improved on BiPAP.

On arrival to the MICU, patient reports that she is feeling
better but is able to relay limited history.

Imaging:
CXR [**2204-3-25**]:
There is marked cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and
interstial and some pulmonary edema. There is more confluent
opacity at R>L basess, consistent with collapse and/or
consolidation. No gross effusion, though small effusions could
be present. The mediastinal contours and hila appear prominent
on this exam.

There is marked cardiomegaly, with upper zone redistribution and
interstial and some pulmonary edema. There is more confluent
opacity at R>L basess, consistent with collapse and/or
consolidation. No gross effusion, though small effusions could
be present. The mediastinal contours and hila appear prominent
on this exam.

CXR [**4-1**]:
ET tube tip now is in appropriate position, is approximately 5
cm from the
carina. Allowing the difference in positioning of the patient,
there has been interval increase in left lower lobe opacity
consistent with increasing pleural effusion and atelectasis.
Moderate right pleural effusion with large right lower lobe
atelectasis is grossly unchanged. Cardiomegaly cannot be
evaluated. The main pulmonary arteries are enlarged consistent
with pulmonary hypertension. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
There are no new lung abnormalities. ET tube tip is in the
stomach.

CT Chest [**2204-4-3**]:
CT OF THE CHEST: Mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do
not meet size criteria for pathology. A nasogastric tube is
noted in standard position.  Minimal atherosclerotic
calcification is noted within the aortic arch and descending
aorta.

Bilateral pleural effusions are noted, right greater than left.
On the right, the pleural effusion tracks into the fissure and
is likely loculated. Minimal adjacent compressive atelectasis is
noted. There is minimal pulmonary edema. Areas of air trapping
are likely due to poor inspiratory effort. Pulmonary artery
measures 3.5cm consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Again
noted is moderate cardiomegaly. There is a small pericardial
effusion. Airways are patent to the subsegmental level.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen and visualized portions of
the left
kidney are unremarkable. An adrenal nodule measures 3.2 x 3.1 cm
and is of
indeterminate consistency. A 7.2 x 6.5 cm hypodensity arising
from the upper pole of the right kidney is slightly increased in
size compared to the most recent prior examination and appears
consistent with a simple renal cyst. A small right adrenal
nodule is unchanged.

Visualized osseous structures show no focal lytic or sclerotic
lesions
suspicious for malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusion, Right >Left. On the right, the
pleural effusion tracks into the fissure and is likely
loculated.
2. Minimal pulmonary edema. Areas of air trapping due to poor
inspiratory
effort.
3. Pulmonary artery 3.5cm consistent with pulmonary
hypertension.
4. Small pericardial effusion. Moderate Cardiomegaly.
6. Left adrenal nodule is indeterminate and incompletely s
