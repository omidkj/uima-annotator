Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**]
Chief Complaint:
85 yo female with hx of HTN, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis,
presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**11-8**] with N/V and epigastric
pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  placement of nasogastric tube
2.  esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy
3.  blood transfusion
4.  VATS procedure with placement of 2 chest tubes
5.  intubation x2
6.  placement of PICC line


History of Present Illness:
Pt was feeling well until [**12-18**] prior to admission, when she
developed increasing nausea/vomiting and epigastric pain.  She
felt it was difficult to get food into her stomach.  Pt was
found to be in a fib, and a CT of abdomen was done, which
revealed a 6cm mass in the region of the head of the body of
pancreas.  Also had thickening of duodenal as well as cecal
walls. EGD done and scope could not be passed past the duodenal
bulb. A clot was found and random duodenal biopsies were taken.
Patient then dropped her SBP and found to be in afib with RVR
with ST depressions in V3-V6 and with supratheraputic INR at 7.
Patient then dropped her HCT from 33- 28 and noted to be
bleeding from NGT and Rectal tube. Patient transfused PRBC and
HCT stabilized.

[**2100-12-7**] CXR (after chest tubes pulled):
AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: The cardiac and mediastinal
contours are stable. There are persistent bilateral pleural
effusions, unchanged compared to the prior study. There is a
left lower lobe opacity consistent with collapse/consolidation.
There is right basilar minor atelectasis. No evidence of
pneumothorax. The lines and tubes are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No interval change compared to the study of one day
prior of bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities.

[**2100-12-1**]  CTA abdomen/pelvis:
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A chest tube is noted on the left,
with a small pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are
noted, right greater than left, with bibasilar atelectatic
changes.
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals and kidneys appear
normal.
The previously noted soft tissue density below the liver hilum,
surrounding hepatic artery branches, is once again identified,
though appears slightly smaller since [**2100-11-14**], previously
measuring approximately 3.4 cm x 3.1 cm, now measuring
approximately 2.8 cm x 2 cm. This area of soft tissue density
surrounds the gastric antrum, and is not associated with the
pancreas, which appears normal. No evidence of pancreatic mass.
No enlarged lymph nodes are seen within the vicinity.
No free interperitoneal air.
CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Extensive diverticula are seen
within the sigmoid colon, without evidence of acute
diverticulitis. The colon is otherwise unremarkable. The uterus
is within normal limits. The urinary bladder contains gas,
presumably from recent Foley catheterization. Minimal free fluid
is seen within the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious osseous lesions. Degenerative
changes are seen within the spine.
Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the above findings, and were
essential for diagnosis.
IMPRESSION: 1) Slight decrease in soft tissue density below the
liver hilum, associated with the gastric antrum, but separate
from the pancreas. This area of soft tissue density is felt to
represent inflammatory changes surrounding the gastric antrum,
and is compatible with the patient's known peptic ulcer disease,
as demonstrated by recent EGB ([**2100-11-15**]).

[**2100-11-22**] echocardiogram:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
