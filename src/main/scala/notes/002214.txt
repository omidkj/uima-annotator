History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 65370**] is a very nice 63 year-old woman with history of
schizoid personality, CAD s/p stent ([**2154**]), CHF (EF ~10%?), h/o
cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 20-30%, Atrial Fibrillation not on
coumadin, chronic L-side pleural effusion and h/o multiple UTIs
who comes complaining of chills and vomit. She was in her prior
state of health at [**Hospital 11851**] Healthcare until last night when
she woke up feeling very cold, with chills. She denied having
her temperature taken at that time. She denied fatigue, nausea,
vomit, diarrhea, chest pain, PND, orthopnea, dysuria,
palpitations, SOB. However, she was [**Doctor Last Name **] to BINeedham's ER.
.
She went to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 8062**] ER where her initial vital signs showed
fever of 104, tachycardia up to 120s and 83% on RA. She coughed
with blood tinged sputum. She was guaiac positive. Multiple
attempts were done to contact her appointed legal guardian and
messages were left, but doctors were unable to reach him. Her
labs showed HCT of 28, Trop 0.09. She had large bowel movement.
Suspected sepsis with unknown source, but he considered the left
lung or a UTI. Pt received  1 L NS. She received Levo/vanc and
1g of Tylenol and was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 1388**] ER her initial VS were T 99.8 F, BP 90/57 mmHg,
HR 112 BPM, RR 22 BPM, 100% 2L NC. Pt had normal physical exam
and reported "melena" in the rectal vault. Got IV access, 2 U
RBC's, IV PPI.
.
Of note she was admitted to [**Location (un) 620**] ~1 month ago and was treated
for E. coli UTI with Bactrim-DS p.o. b.i.d her HCT at that time
was HCT 26 [**2158-2-1**].

CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Probable left pneumonia.
2. Persistent moderate-to-large-size left pleural effusion, at
least partially
loculated, presumably infectious or malignant.

ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse low voltage. Baseline artifact.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2155-4-25**] the T wave inversion recorded in
leads V2-V5 and Q-T interval prolongation have resolved
consistent with prior recording representing active
anterolateral ischemia. The present findings may represent
pseudonormalization. Followup and clinical correlation are
suggested.

CHEST CT ON [**3-15**]

HISTORY: Fever, chills and large left pleural effusion.
Considering
thoracentesis.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was
performed without intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] reconstructed as
contiguous 5- and 1-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal and
paramedian sagittal images read in conjunction with chest
radiographs from [**2154**] and [**2-15**] and [**2158-3-14**].

FINDINGS:
The large left pleural abnormality which increased between
[**2-15**] and [**3-14**] is a lenticular collection, extending
along the left costal pleural margin from the apex to the
diaphragm, occupying approximately half of the volume of the
left hemithorax. The wall of the pleural abnormality is
extremely irregular, ranging up to 3 cm in thickness, including
a high-density inner rind that ranges in attenuation up to 70
[**Doctor Last Name **], consistent with either partial calcification or chronic
organized hematoma. The contents are heterogeneous ranging in
attenuation from [**Doctor Last Name **] 30 to [**Doctor Last Name **] 50, conceivably partially
hemorrhagic as well; since there is no level at the interface
with small pockets of gas in the collection, the contents are
either extremely viscous or not fluid at all. The source of the
gas could be a recent attempt at thoracentesis, communication
with the lung/bronchial tree, or, least common, gas-forming
pleural infection.

The left main and upper lobe bronchi are patent, but the
lingular segmental bronchus is moderately narrowed, and the
superior segment of the left lower lobe, the basal trunk and
basal segmental bronchi are all completely occluded. Whether
this is due to mass effect of the pleural collection or a
combination of mass effect with longstanding atelectasis of the
lower lobe and lingula, and some hilar adenopathy is hard to
say, although a segment of the basal trunk with wall
calcification clearly shows occlusion by material or tissue in
the bronchus at that level.

The left ventricle is very dilated, at the expense of the right
ventricle, and there is ex
