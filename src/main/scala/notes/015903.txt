History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 64 year old woman with a history of diabetes and
mental retardation who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED on [**7-16**]
with acute renal failure and back pain.
.
Patient is mentally retarded and has a 24 hour caregiver. She
was recently seen in the ED and plain films were done of the hip
and lumbar spine which showed no fracure and mild spinal
stenosis. She was discharged on vicodin. She returned several
days later and had an injection to her back or hip. According to
her caregiver she has been taking less pos and has not taken her
medications recently. Two days prior to admission she had a
temperature of 102 at home. She is usually very functional and
holds a job, but over the last two days she has been combative
and uncooperative and refused to go to work. She was seen in her
PCP's office where she was noted to have no temperature and her
symptoms were felt to be due to back pain from spinal stenosis.
.
In the ED at [**Location (un) 620**] her creatinine on admission was 7.2 up from
a baseline of 0.9. BUN was 127, AG 28, lactate 4.0 (delta/delta
was 1). Her initial vitals were T 99.1, BP 90-112/45-57 with HR
90s, RR 27-45, O2 sat 91-96% on 2L. ABG was 7.28/18/65. She had
only 89 cc of urine output.
.
 Urine had > 100 wbc, moderate bacteria (MSSA), positive
nitrite, and moderate wbc. Per renal there were muddy brown
casts.
.
She was started on D5W with 150 mEq of NaHCO3 at 200cc/hr and
received 1650 cc. She also received flagyl, vancomycin,
levofloxacin and ceftazadime. Her ABG improved to 7.46/29/81;
however her respiratory status declined and she was intubated
for hypoxia and acidosis in the setting of sepsi and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 year old woman with mental retardation and history of
diabetes presents with acute renal failure [**2-23**] to sepsis and
subsequent ATN requiring dialysis.
.
#) ID: Infectious foci this admission include lower paraspinal
abscesses, sphenoid sinus collections, upper spinal phlegmons,
UTI, and possible line infection. She was septic at admission
and required ICU care and mechanical ventilation for respiratory
failure (now resolved).
A) Paraspinal abscesses: Initial MRI revealed epidural abcess
from L4 to brain. Possible phlegmon not epidural abcess in
brain.  On [**2136-7-23**] cultures from the abscess grew MSSA.
Paraspinal abscesses were drained by Orthopedics/Spine on
[**2135-7-27**].  However, on [**2136-8-14**] Ortho was reconsulted for wound
drainage and low grade temps. A repeat MRI at that time was
consistent with discitis, osteomyelitis and primarily ventral
epidural abscess at T6, T7 and T8 have improved and there is
less spinal cord compression compared to [**7-29**]. There appears to
have been a second poorly visualized epidural abscess ventrally
at the T4 level. It has also improved. There is a loculated
collection laterally at the T6 level, little changed.  The ortho
spine attending did not feel that this required further drainage
due to patient's improving clinical status.  Patient was treated
with a course of Nafcillin.  B) B/L sphenoid sinuses were
drained by ENT on [**2136-7-28**]. C)Upper spinal phlegmons were not
amenable to drainage, therefore will be treated with IV
antibiotics. D) MSSA UTI was treated with 10day course of
Ciprofloxacin (per ID recs) though it was likely [**2-23**]/
hematoligic spread of her sepsis.  E) The patient developed high
fevers (>105 F) on [**8-22**] and [**8-23**]. Abdominal CT at that time was
negative. The fevers were thought to be [**2-23**] line infections. Her
HD tunneled catheter was pulled [**8-24**] and her antibiotics were
broadened. Blood cultures failed to grow any pathogen. The
fevers resolved after removal of the line. After two days of
being afebrile and with negative blood cultures, a temporary HD
catheter was placed [**8-27**].  A permanent tunneled HD catheter was
placed [**8-30**].  F) The patient developed diarrhea on [**8-21**], and
metronidazole was started empirically.  (C diff negative.)  The
patient will be discharged on oral metronidazole to be continued
as long as she is on Nafcillin.
A TEE on [**7-25**] was negative for endocarditis. MRV negative for
jugular thrombus
PLAN- Patient will complete a six week course of IV Nafcillin (2
grams q4hours).  She will be evaluated by ID upon completion of
this course at which time recommendations for any further
antibiotic treatment will be made.  The patient also has a 6
week follow up appointment with Ortho/Spine re: her paraspinal
abscess.
.
#) Renal failure: Pt developed ARF [**2-23**] to sepsis and consequent
ATN. The renal team was consulted and followed the patient
closely throughout her admission. She developed rising
creatinine and oliguria refractory to high-dose diuretics.
Therefore she was started on hemodialysis on [**7-20**].  A
tunneled IJ catheter was placed.  As her HD catheter was thought
to be cause of fever/sepsis [**8-22**] and [**8-23**], line pulled [**8-24**].  A
temporary IR placed HD catheter was placed [**8-27**], this was changed
for a permanent catheter on [**8-30**].  She is currently on HD MWF.
She continues on Nephrocaps.  She was initially oliguric,
however on [**8-27**] she began to make increasing amounts of urine.
Per Renal, she continued to require TIW dialysis at discharge,
however, the patient will follow up with renal as an outpatien
