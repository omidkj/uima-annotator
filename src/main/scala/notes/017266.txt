seen, one in the ascending colon and one in the descending colon

be benign adenomas. However in the sigmoid colon at 30 cm, there
was a worrisome friable lesion seen, which was infiltrative and
malignant appearing with multiple diverticula are rounded with
narrowing. That was biopsied and the 30-cm mass revealed cells

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient with history of CAD, CABG, angioplasty, asthma,
GERD, PVD, HTN, L iliac-femoral bypass was admitted s/p low
anterior resection for malignancy of the sigmoid colon on
[**2138-1-24**]. Please see operative note for full details.
.
Post-operatively, the patient was admitted to the SICU given his
multiple medical morbidities. The patient was followed by the
Pulmonary and Cardiology service. On post-operative day #2, the
patient noted erythema around the superior aspect of the
incision. The incision was opened and packed and the patient was
started on Kefzol. This wound infection improved. On
post-operative day #4, the patient experienced chest pain
without any EKG changes and a rise in troponin that was thought
to be secondary to a troponin leak. As a result, the patient was
started on ASA and beta blocker was increased, but given the
patient's recent surgery, heparin was not instituted. On
post-operative day #9, the patient was noted to have erythema
and induration on the inferior aspect of the incision. The
incision was opened and packed and the patient was sent home
with a 7 day course of Kefzol to complete (per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**]. The
wound will be assessed daily by [**Last Name (STitle) 269**] and changed at least twice
daily until his follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Otherwise, on
discharge the patient was ambulating and voiding without
difficulty, tolerating fluids and afebrile.
