Admission Date:  [**2119-10-5**]              Discharge Date:   [**2119-10-27**]

Date of Birth:  [**2050-7-13**]             Sex:   M

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Allopurinol / Vancomycin / Ciprofloxacin
/ Augmentin / Azithromycin / Linezolid / Cefepime / Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Skin biopsy


History of Present Illness:
69M with AML s/p clofarabine with prolonged remission then
recurrence, now on decitabine s/p completion of cycle 9 on
[**2119-9-4**], COPD/emphysema, presenting to [**Hospital 3242**] clinic on [**2119-10-5**]
with worsening shortness of breath. He was noted to have a
low-grade temp to 99.9F and SaO2 of 92-95% on room air, up to
96% on 2L NC. He had a CXR done, which demonstrated a small LLL
PNA. His wbc was 1.2 with 29%N for an ANC of around 400, which
is consistent with his recent baseline. He has multiple
antibiotic allergies and intolerances, including:
Sulfa: Unknown
Vancomycin: Rash (morbilliform, not red man)
Cipro: Rash
Augmentin: Rash
Azithromycin: Rash
Linezolid: Subjective SOB
Several of these, however, were questionable, due to concurrent
use of other medications. He was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2602**] [**Doctor Last Name 2603**] on [**2119-10-5**]
in anticipation of this current admission, who noted that the
PCN/Augmentin allergy was based on an uncertain history, but
recommendation had been made for desensitization to any
pencillins or carbapenems. He noted, however, that the
cross-reactivity for 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporins is
<4%, and that a trial of such could be tried at full dose. He
therefore received cefepime 2gm in [**Hospital 3242**] clinic prior to
admission, with no adverse effects. Admitted for further
evaluation. After admission, spiked to 103.2F.

He denies any preceding sore throat, nasal/sinus congestion, and
admits only a mild non-productive cough. He denies any new rash,
pruritis, or oropharyngeal swelling since starting cefepime. He
does endorse significant nausea/vomiting over the last day, with
no abdominal pain or diarrhea.


Past Medical History:
PMH: Oncologic history:
Patient initially presented in summer [**2116**] with easy bruising
and dropping cell counts (pancytopenic) as well as some
SOB/fatigue. BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic
syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent
with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with
MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting
acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.
.
Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**]. Since
that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines
and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring
in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow
cellularity. Cytogenetics showed deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 20 and he was treated on [**2118-9-19**] with his first
cycle of decitabine. C2 decitabine started [**2118-11-1**]. He has
previously opted not to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant
due to quality of life desires.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CXR: Minor new left lower lobe opacity, minimal pneumonia is
possible,
unlikely to be bacterial.
- CT chest: Marked diffuse centrilobular emphysema, unchanged.
No focal airspace consolidation to suggest typical bacterial
pneumonia. Interval resolution of right upper lobe pneumonia.
Mild septal thickening compatible with mild fluid overload. Mild
bibasilar atelectasis, left worse than right. No pneumothorax,
pleural effusion, or lymphadenopathy.
- Video and barium swallow: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia,
without evidence of penetration or gross aspiration or
significant residue. Normal esophageal contour without evidence
of stricture. Intraesophageal reflux visualized with nonspecific
impairment of gastric motility as described
above. No gastroesophageal reflux is visualized.
- Right buttock skin biospy: The histologic features are most
consistent with a bullous hypersensitivity reaction, such as to
a drug.
- Repeat CT chest: Generalized ground-glass attenuation
throughout both lungs and septal thickening particularly in the
dependent lower lobes, increased since [**2119-10-7**], likely pulmonary
edema, either cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic (including drug
reaction), less likelyatypical infection.
Severe centrilobular emphysema, stable since [**2116-10-9**].
- V/Q scan: Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolism.
- Bronchioaveolar lavage: Negative for malignant cells
- Lower extremity ultrasound: No evidence of DVT in the right
lower extremity.
