Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
L tongue and facial swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Elective intubation for airway protection

History of Present Illness:
88F with a history of CAD, tachyarrhythmia with a pacemaker in
place, HTN, and s/p CVA with residual L side deficits who lives
at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab who presents with painful L tongue and facial
swelling for the past 12 hours. By report, the patient began to
have pain under the left side of her tongue last night. This AM
her tongue was swollen and painful, and the swelling had spread
to her face. By report she had odynophagia, dysphagia, and
dysphonia this AM. She was brought to the ED for evaluation.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.1 72 104/61 18 96% on RA.
Initial exam and history was concerning for Ludwig's angina, and
ENT was consulted. Her initial labs were notable for a WBC of
11.4 with 82% PMNs and no bands. Based on her significant tongue
edema, ENT was concerned about airway compromised. The patient
is DNR DNI, but agreed to elective intubation for reversible
causes. She was intubated for airway protection and underwent a
neck CT which did not show Ludwig's angina, but did show
significant sialadenitis. On exam, pus was expressed from her L
submandibular gland and sent for culture. She received
vancomycin 1000mg IV x1, levofloxacin 750mg IV x1, and
metronidazole 500mg IV x1 and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she is intubated and sedated.

PM Within the left Warthin's duct draining the left
submandibular gland are multiple calcified stones measuring up
to 5 mm. The duct itself is enlarged, with a hyperemic wall. The
left submandibular gland is also hyperemic, and enlarged, and
contains multiple sialoliths. No focal fluid collection is
identified. The submandibular space appears uninvolved. There is
inflammatory stranding in the subcutaneous tissues of the neck
from the thyroid cartilage up to the angle of the mandible. No
significant lymphadenopathy is seen. Visualized intracranial
contents appear normal. The carotid arteries and vertebrobasilar
system demonstrate normal contrast enhancement, without focal
filling defects, aneurysm, occlusion, or significant
atherosclerotic change.  An aneurysm clip is seen in the right
middle cranial fossa. The mastoid air cells are clear, there is
minimal mucosal thickening of the left maxillary and ethmoid
sinuses. There is opacification of the sphenoid sinus which is
likely related to recent intubation. Within the neck, there is a
1.3 x 1.8 cm round mass possibly arising from the isthmus with
enhancing and hypodense components, which has increased in size
compared with prior. The lung apices demonstrate marked
emphysematous change, as seen on prior. There is multilevel
degenerative change of the cervical and visualized thoracic
spine. The patient is intubated, with the tip of the ET tube
approximately 3 cm from the carina. The balloon appears somewhat
hyperinflated. IMPRESSION: 1. Sialadenitis of the left
submandibular gland with multiple stones in the left Warthin's
duct which is dilated and hyperemic. No focal fluid collection.
2. Midline neck mass possibly arising from inferior aspect of
the isthmus gland of the thyroid, increased in size compared
with prior.Recommend evaluation with thyroid ultrasound. 3.
Intubated state, with a prominent appearing endotracheal tube
balloon.  4. Emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Sialadenitis: Found to have multiple sialoliths on CT thought
to be causing stasis and infection. The patient was covered
broadly per ENT recommendations for gram positives and
oropharyngeal flora with vancomycin 1000mg IV Q24H ,
levofloxacin 500mg IV Q24H , and metronidazole 500mg IV Q8H .
Blood cultures were sent and were negative upon discharge. Wound
cultures were sent and grew out rare group B Beta Strep. She was
found to be MRSA negative.  Antibiotics moved to Levoflox and
Clindamycin, to be continued x 2 week course through [**2168-8-26**].
.
# Airway protection: Electively intubated due to significant
edema on exam with threatened compromise of the upper airway.
She was sedated with propofol and fentanyl. Started on
dexamethasone 10mg IV Q8H per ENT to decrease airway edema in
preparation for extubation. This was discontinued after the
patientw as successfully extubated.
.
#Aspiration: Had witnessed aspiration with meds on [**2168-8-18**], with
hypoxia.  Resolved with suctioning of pills. S&S consult done
with recs to ground thin diet and precautions as listed in
treatments section.
.
# Hypothermia: T94.5 on admission. Unclear if related to sepsis,
hypothyroidism, or techinical difficulties with measuring
temperature due to mouth swel
