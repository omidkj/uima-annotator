History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19205**] is a 71 yo female with atrial fibrillation on
coumadin/arpirin/plavix, coronary artery disease, and congestive
heart failure who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2190-11-25**]. She tripped
while walking down the stairs and hit her head on a driveway.
Afterwards she had only epistaxis but denied headache or LOC. At
[**Hospital1 **], a head CT showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage so she was
transferred here for neurosurgical evaluation. She was initially
awake, alert and oriented with a normal neuro exam in their ED,
but she developed a left facial droop and UE weakness during the
ambulance ride.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was intubated upon arrival for airway
protection secondary to worsening mental status and
emesis/bloody secretions. She received proplex, dilantin, FFP,
and platelets in the ED. A repeat head CT here revealed large
bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages as well as a large
right-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage. She was admitted to the
MICU as Neurosurgery did not recommend surgical intervention.
.
In the MICU, her INR was reversed (was 2.9 due to being on
coumadin). Another CT scan the morning after admission showed
slight subfalcine herniation. She was started on mannitol. Her
mental status improved where she was intermittently following
commands. Initially, she was placed on vancomycin and
ceftriaxone which were discontinued after 3 days. She was
diuresed in order to maximally wean her from the vent. The
mannitol was tapered. Per neurosurgery, it was okay to restart
coumadin (on [**12-3**]) but this was not done by the MICU team. The
MICU team did discuss anticoagulation with the patient's family
on multiple occasions, including the risks and benefits of
remaining off of the anticoagulation with her known atrial
fibrillation and cardiac dysfunction.
.
Her fingersticks were difficult to control requiring an insulin
drip while in the ICU. Serial head CTs were unchanged. In the
ICU, she became febrile and was placed on vancomycin and
meropenem for an 8 day course. Bronchoscopy revealed diffuse
friable mucosa in both bronchial trees and a small amount of
thin secretions. Lavage of her left upper lobe grew nothing, but
sputum culture did grow MSSA. Blood cultures grew coagulase
negative Staph from 1/4 bottles and were felt to be contaminant.
Her central line was removed and a PICC was placed prior to
coming to the floor.
.
It was difficult to get her therapeutic on Dilantin so she was
changed to keppra. She was extubated on [**12-7**]. Her c-spine was
unable to be cleared clinically as she could not flex or extend
her neck on command. However, the family felt very strongly that
her collar should be removed, so it was. She had a bedside
swallow on [**12-9**] which she failed. However, this was difficult
to interpret as she was not fully alert. She did begin speaking
single words. She was called out to the floor from the ICU on
[**12-11**].

Past Medical History:
1. Type 2 DM, on glyburide as outpt
2. Status post vitreous hemorrhage in right eye and early
retinopathy in both eyes as per the patient's ophthalmologist.
3. CAD status post anterior MI nine years ago, most recent cath
[**6-28**] with 80% mLAD (not stented) and 90% LCx (stented w/DES)
4. Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 20% in [**12-28**], status post
biventricular pacer internal defibrillator. 2+MR/TR w/severe PA
HTN
5. Hypertension.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. Atrial fibrillation.
8. CKD (baseline mid 1's prior to admission)

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
