Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 86 yo F with history of LGIB, known diverticulosis,
AFib on coumadin, who presented with GI bleeding.  She was
admitted to the ICU for close monitoring.  There she received an
additional 3 units of pRBC for a total of 5 units this
admission.  On [**5-31**] she underwent EGD which revealed a small
hiatal hernia but no source of bleeding.  She then underwent
colonoscopy which revealed a bleeding Dieulafoy lesion in the
ascending colon; she received epi injection and 3 endoclips with
reported achievement of hemostasis.  Multiple diverticula also
seen in the entire colon.  She was transferred to the floor
where she received serial Hct checks Q8H.  She was transfused 2
additional units of pRBCs per attending recommendations.  She
remained hemodynamically stable while in-house and tolerated a
cardiac diet.
.
The patient was on anticoagulation as an outpatient for Atrial
Fibrillation.  This was held in house; the patient was advised
to hold her coumadin and ASA until she saw her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had RVR
on [**6-1**], requiring restarting of her Bblocker.  This was
uptitrated to her home dose of atenolol 50 [**Hospital1 **].
.
That same day, the patient complained of heel pain, R>L.  She
was unable to walk due to the pain.  Podiatry was consulted and
suspected plantar fascitis.  She has an elevated uric acid, and
her presentation overall was suspicious for gout.  She denied
history of gout, but admitted to prior colchicine therapy.
NSAIDs were avoided due to GI Bleed history.  She received 3
doses of PO prednisone with rapid resolution of her pain.  PT
cleared her to go home.
.
The patient had had low-grade fevers before the onset of heel
pain, with no leukocytosis.  She had a positive UA and was
treated with ceftriaxone while in-house.  CXR was negative.
Once she was treated with prednisone for clinical gout, her
fever resolved.
