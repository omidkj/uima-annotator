AR, severe aortic stenosis.
.

Discharge labs:

- ECG: Sinus tahcycardia to 125, NA, NI, ?LVH [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 19300**]
criteria, no t wave changes or ST segment changes concerning for
ischemia
.
- ECHO OSH: EF 20-25%, with severe left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, mild AR, severe aortic stenosis.
.
- CT from OSH [**2131-12-17**]:  CT CHEST:
There are no filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature to
suggest
pulmonary embolism.  There is severe cardiomegaly.  Coronary
artery calcifications are present.  There is no pericardial
effusion.  The
aorta is normal in caliber without evidence of a dissection.
There
are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
associated
bibasal atelectasis.  In addition, there are perihilar
consolidations
in the upper lobes, right middle lobe, lingula, and the superior
segments of the lower lobes.  There is a mildly enlarged right
hilar
lymph node measuring 13 mm, and a prominent right
infrahilar lymph node measuring 8 mm.  No enlarged mediastinal
or axillary lymph nodes are seen.
.
CT ABDOMEN:
There is diffuse mesenteric fat stranding with trace fluid, as
well as
severe gallbladder wall edema.  These findings suggest fluid
third
spacing, such as may be seen in a low protein state or chronic
systemic illness.  No focal hepatic or pancreatic lesions are
seen on
this single phase exam.  The spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys
are
unremarkable.  Small bowel and colon loops are normal in caliber
and
grossly unremarkable, allowing for absence of oral contrast.
.
CT PELVIS:
The prostate appears to be near the upper limit of normal size.
The
bladder and rectum are unremarkable.
.
CT BONES:
The bones are diffusely mottled with apparent diffuse sclerotic
infiltration.  There is an 11 mm lytic lesion in the superior
endplate of the L4 vertebral body (series 306b, image 36).
.
IMPRESSION:
1. NO EVIDENCE OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM.
2. SEVERE CARDIOMEGALY AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.  NO
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.
3. MULTIFOCAL PERIHILAR CONSOLIDATIONS, MOST SUGGESTIVE OF
PNEUMONIA.  SMALL-TO-MODERATE BILATERAL PLEUR
