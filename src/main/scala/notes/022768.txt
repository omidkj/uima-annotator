Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
transjugular liver biopsy [**2182-11-8**]

History of Present Illness:
59 ESRD on HD, HIV, HCV not being treated. s/p parathyroidectomy
[**11-1**], d/c'ed today [**11-3**].  Pt reports that today she went home
and felt weak, had abdominal pain, and was nauseated, vomited
non-bilious non-bloody material then came to the ER.  The pt
reports that she hasn't eaten anything all day, has no appetite,
and hasn't had a BM since before the surgery.  The pt reports
that she may have felt this way while in the hospital this
recent admission.  On arrival to the ED her FSBG was 30, and in
the ED they administered D50 ampule and raised the FSBS to 72,
which was then followed and trended to be 130, 155, to 108.  In
the ER the pt also received approximately 300ml of D5 1/2 NS,
and was put on a drip of 50cc/hr.  Pt reports that her last
dialysis administration was the day before yesterday.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the pt is lethargic and generally slow
to respond to questions.  The pt continued to endose abdominal
pain, but said that she wasn't particularly nauseated.  The pt
repeatedly would say that she's "not long for this world".
.
In discussion with the surgeons who performed the procedure,
they could not identify any connection between the surgery and
liver failure.  The noted that the surgery was uncomplicated.

PERTINENT STUDIES
[**11-8**] Transjugular liver bx:
Liver, transjugular needle core biopsies:
Fragmented core biopsies of liver demonstrating:
1.  Established cirrhosis (confirmed with Trichrome stain),
Stage 4 fibrosis, with delicate sinusoidal fibrosis.
2.  Moderate predominantly microvesicular steatosis without
associated ballooning degeneration or intracytoplasmic hyalin.
3.  Moderate canalicular cholestasis with occasional associated
lobular neutrophils.
4.  Scattered focal areas of hepatocyte dropout/necrosis and
parenchymal collapse (confirmed with reticulin stain).
5.  Iron stain shows marked Kupffer cell and mild hepatocellular
iron deposition.

1. Patent portal vein with antegrade flow.
2. Small amount of ascites, unchanged.
3. Small amount of gallbladder sludge, but no cholelithiasis or
acute
cholecystitis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Hepatic and splenic iron deposition without pancreatic
involvement,
consistent with hemosiderosis.

biliary
dilation.
