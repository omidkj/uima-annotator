Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5552**]
Chief Complaint:
Febrile neutropenia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
74F w/ with a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung CA who was
seen in clinic on the day prior to admission with epistaxis,
fatigue and oral ulcers. She reports that she has epistaxis
frequently, but that it was much worse than usual, (dripping
blood, used 3 boxes of kleenex, passing several clots). She
reports the fatigue is stable x 3 weeks. Oral
ulcers/inflammation of her lips has been present x 2 weeks; it
is uncler if this is due to HSV vs a side effect of chemo. She
received a platelet transfusion and was started on acyclovir
(for presumptive oral HSV).
.
The patient returned to clinic in follow up on the day of
admission; she was found to be febrile to 100.4 with
neutropenia. She was therefore transferred to OMED for direct
admission.

EKG:
Sinus tachycardia
Possible left atrial abnormality
Late R wave progression - probable normal variant
Since pervious tracing, heart rate faster
.
[**2-9**] CXR: 1. Bibasilar opacities are concerning for
consolidation or atelectasis. 2. Left hemidiaphragm elevation
and left pleural effusion are unchanged. 3. Left superior
mediastinal mass has increased in size which may be due to tumor
extension, atelectasis surrounding the tumor, or
post-obstructive consolidation.
.
[**2-12**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe
resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. A mid-cavitary gradient
is identified.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present.
The aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate to severe
mitral annular
calcification. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial
mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is
moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 female with NSCLC admitted for febrile neutropenia,
transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for 24 hours with sudden respiratory failure
due to pulmonary edema, then transferred back to OMED where her
course was complicated by pneumonia and recurrent pulmonary
edema due to diastolic failure.
.
When patient arrived to the floor on admission she was initially
stable, breathing comfortably with a lung exam notable for only
decreased sounds in the LLL. However, shortly after arrival, she
developed acute respiratory distress with tachypnea and
shortness of breath. VS were significant for BP of 190s/100s,
HR: 160s. Her lung exam revealed diffuse crackles and rales. Her
ABG was 7.33/57/71 on facemask. CXR showed cephalization and
some consolidation at the left hemidiaphragm. Lasix 40 mg IV was
given x3. Nebs were given. Nitropaste (1 inch) was applied.
Hydrocortisone 40 mg IV was given. Bipap was started. The
patient was emergently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for Bipap and
closer monitoring.
.
In the ICU patient was still very tachypneic and in respirtory
distress so given 4mg of morphine. After morphine given patient
respiratory status improved however her blood pressure dropped
to SBP 60s and she was then given IVF bolus which she responded
to. Her Bipap was able to be removed shortly afterwards. She
remained stable overnight and was then called out to the floor
for further management.  She again had respiratory distress
secondary to pulmonary edema triggered by HTN and tachycardia on
[**2-10**]; this event was managed on the floor with Lasix and
Lopressor IV.
.
On the floor, the following issues were addressed.
.
#Pulmonary edema/Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's
respiratory failure was thought to be due to sudden pulmonary
edema due to tachycardia and hypertension in the setting of
severe diastolic heart failure and LVOT obstruction.  Cardiology
was consulted.  Her betablocker was titrated up to 75mg TID by
discharge with marked improvement in her heart rate (120's on
admission, down to 100's by discharge).  Her Valsartan was
discontinued. She will follow up with cardiology after discharge
for further management of her severe diastolic disfunction and
consideration of AV nodal ablation. Additionally, albuterol was
d/c'd and levalbuterol started to minimize the side effect of
tachycardia.
.
#PNA: The patient was found to have b/l PNA on CXR; several
aspiration events were witnessed throughout her hospitalization.
She was initially treated with cefepime and vancomycin for
febrile neutropenia; this was changed to Zosyn for broader
coverage given her aspiration events.  She required supplemental
O2 via non-rebreather then shovel mask for the first several
days of her admission; this was weaned as her O2 sats improved.
She was discharged on levofloxacin for a total of a 2 week
course
