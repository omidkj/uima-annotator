Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: shortness of breath

Reason for MICU transfer: tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62-year-old gentleman with HIV (not compliant with
HAART, most recent CD4 220), DM2 with nephropathy (baseline Cr
1.8-2.0), Hodgkin's and Burkitt's lymphoma (s/p doxorubicin,
vinblastine, dacarbazine now in remission), CHF (EF 22% in
[**1-/2142**]) with recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 39579**] for RLL
pneumonia treated with 10 days of levofloxacin (end date
[**2142-4-26**]).  He was discharged to rehab.  He presented to PCP
today with SOB and orthopnea (needs to sit in a chair to sleep).
 Denies chest pain.  Continues to have non-productive cough,
anorexia and fatigue.  Denies fever.  He also notes increased
abdominal distention but regular non-bloody bowel movements and
regular urination.  CXR in [**Hospital 3390**] clinic today revealed large right
sided effusion.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.5 90 136/96 24 100% 4L.  Labs
notable for WBC 9.1 with 1% band, 3% myelo, 3% meta, Cr 1.8
(baseline ~2), BUN 36, Na 132, K 5.3, lactate 2.8, ALT 105, AST
83, AP 605.  UA with 100+ protein, no WBCs.  Blood and urine
cultures sent.  CT torso with contrast showed simple large right
pleural effusion with RLL collapse and abdominal free fluid.  He
received cefepime, vancomycin and metronidazole.  Zofran given
for nausea.  Paracentesis not attempted due to poorly identified
effusion.  Over ED course, dyspnea increased to 30-40, sats 92%
RA and 94% on 2L so admitted to MICU.  IP [**Name (NI) 653**], planning
for thoracentesis in AM.  Most recent vitals: 82 130/82 20 94%
2L.

In the MICU, patient reports feeling better, breathing is
comfortable. He states his dry weight is 149lb. He weighs in at
154lbs today. He received Torsemide 40 mg IV 1x and got a had a
diagnostic thoracentesis which revealed a transudative effusion.
Cultures of fluid are pending. CXR after tap revealed some
resolution of effusion. He was also found to be somewhat
hyperkalemia to 5.5 but more torsemide was not given because of
concern regarding renal function due to his chronic DM related
renal disease as well as recent contrast administration.

Currently, he reports that he feels much better and does not
have SOB when sitting or lying down. He denies any pain but says
that this abdomen continues to feel distended.

Radiology
CXR ([**2142-4-26**])
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has undergone a right thoracocentesis.  The extent of the right
pleural effusion has substantially decreased.  There is an
opacity at the right lung base, likely reflecting reexpansion
lung edema.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No change in
appearance of the left lung and of the cardiac silhouette.

Cytology - pleural fluid
Pleural fluid:
  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Mesothelial cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62-year-old gentleman with HIV CD4 220, DM2, CKD,
Hodgkin's/Burkitt's lymphoma, CHF (LVEF 22%) with recent RLL
pneumonia and interval development of right pleural effusion.
While in the emergency department, patient had respiratory rates
in the 30 - 40s and was admitted to ICU for tachypnea.

# RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION: Patient presented to PCP's office for
worsening dyspnea, was found to have increased pleural effusion.
 Patient was sent to ED and subsequently admitted to the MICU
for tachypnea.  His effusion was drained by IP.  The fluid did
not appear pustular on thoracentesis and patient felt much
improved after fluid removal.  CHF exacerbation seems most
probable given recently reduced torsemide, abdominal distention
with free fluid, simple appearing effusion, and weight gain.
Patient was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime, but
the vancomycin was stopped after plerual fluid gram stain showed
no microorganisms.  Cefepime was also later discontinued.
Pleural culture and cytology both returned negative.

#  ACUTE ON CHRONIC CHF EXACERBATION: Suspected secondary to
torsemide being held since recent admission and recent
pneumonia.  Patient received IV torsem
