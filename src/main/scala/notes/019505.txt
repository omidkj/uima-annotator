Service:  MEDICINE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old
female with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, no
known cardiac history, who presented to [**Hospital3 4527**] with
the complaint of fever, chills, fatigue, and malaise times
one day.  This was also accompanied by transient chest
reported one episode of nausea and vomiting.

Workup at [**Hospital3 4527**] included an EKG, which was without
ischemic changes.  However, the cardiac enzymes were
significant for a troponin of 26 and CK of 765.  Chest x-ray
showed a left pleural effusion and vascular congestion.  EKG
showed normal sinus rhythm IVCD, poor R-wave progression, no

She was started on Heparin and Levofloxacin for pneumonia and
transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further cardiac management.
In the ED here, she denied shortness of breath or chest pain.
She was noted to be febrile to 102 and with decreased breath
sounds at the left base, 92% on five liters.  Shortly after
transfer to the floor, she became progressively tachypneic
and dropped her saturations to less than 70 on facemask and
she was subsequently intubated.

On examination, just prior to intubation, she was audibly
wheezing and had bilateral crackles, no JVD.  Bedside
echocardiogram showed an EF of 20%, septal and anterolateral
akinesis.  She required pressors and fluids for hypotension
and she was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit and
underwent Swan-Ganz catheterization to determined whether she
had CHF versus pneumonia as the cause of her respiratory
event.  Swan numbers are as follows:  RA pressure 8; PA
pressure 36/17; wedge 13; decreased SVR.  Therefore, it was
felt that her numbers were more consistent with septic
physiology and early acute respiratory distress syndrome.
She was started on Levofloxacin and Ceftriaxone and
transferred to the MICU service on [**5-9**] for further
management of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Antibiotics were subsequently changed to Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin.  She underwent bronchoscopy with negative BAL
studies.  She subsequently developed a new right-sided
infiltrate, which was felt to be ventilator-associated
pneumonia.  The extubation was delayed for many days due to
excessive sedation, which was even treated at one point with
Flumazenil and Narcan.  She eventually woke up and was
extubated successfully on [**5-16**].  She was transferred to
the floor on [**5-17**] to the Medicine Service on oxygen by
nasal cannula.  She had no complaints on admission to the
floor.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, she reports
occasional chest pain with walking, which lasts at most 10
minutes and resolves with rest.  Sometimes the chest
tightness radiates to the bilateral shoulders.She has had no such
sxs since admission.She has no
associated symptoms.  She denies orthopnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea and she does report mild ankle and foot
swelling on occasion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes type II, exercise and diet controlled.  She has
previously been on oral agents.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Bilateral glaucoma.
4.  Basilar insufficiency, diagnosed by MRA in [**2178**], status
post two syncopal episodes in the past.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Mavik 5 mg p.o.once a day.
2.  Nifedipine, dosage unknown.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once a day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with a
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old husband.  [**Name (NI) 6419**] are quite independent.  She is
functional and does water aerobics.  No smoking or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed temperature 98.4,
blood pressure 140/60, heart rate 65, respirations 20, 95% on
two liters.  GENERAL:   The patient is in no apparent
distress, pleasant, speaks slowly.  HEENT:  Pupils equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Moist mucous membranes.
Oropharynx clear.  NECK:  No JVD, lymphadenopathy,
thyromegaly.  LUNGS:  Crackles bilaterally, ?????? up.  HEART:
Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops appreciated.  GI:  Soft, nondistended, nondistended,
no organomegaly or masses, normoactive bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Mild bilateral edema to the shin, good distal
pulses.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact
to motor strength bilaterally, intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs revealed the following:  White count
19.8, 87% neutrophils, 8% lymphocyte, hematocrit 32.7,
platelet count 358,000, glucose 186, sodium 142, potassium
5.1, chloride 100, bicarbonate 32, BUN 51, creatinine 0.9.
The last x-ray done on [**5-15**] revealed bilateral pleural
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Please see history of present
illness above for details.  In short, the patient is an
84-year-old female with diabetes mellitus and hypertension
who presented after a non-Q wave MI at an outside hospital.
She was intubated for respiratory distress and felt to have
pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.  After
being called up to the floor, she underwent further cardiac
workup.  TTE on [**5-20**] showed an EF of 30%, mildly dilated left
ventricle, LDH, impaired relaxation, severe hypokinesis of
the anterior septum, free wall and apex.  She was continued
on aspirin and an ACE inhibitor and scheduled for stress
test.  I have been asked to dictated this before the results
of the stress, therefore, I will have to dictated a discharge
addendum after the test has been performed.  We will also
start a beta blocker after her stress test is completed.
On intial portion of pharmacologic stress pt had no sxs and no
ekg changes. The thallium imaging is pending at time of editing
d/c summary.
The patient is discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition.

1.  Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.
2.  Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Type 2 DM- diet controlled
