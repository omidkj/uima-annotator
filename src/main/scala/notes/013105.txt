resolved with conservative management. TOday comes in again with
abdominal distension, n/v x 3 d (but none today) - inability to

CT [**2191-5-4**] IMPRESSION:
1. High-grade small-bowel obstruction with a transition point in
the right pelvis, very similar in appearance to the study of
[**2191-3-8**]. Small amounts of ascites as described above.
2. Irregularity and heterogeneity of the uterus as seen on prior
studies. This abnormality is adjacent to the area of the
transition point mentioned in #1.
3. Increase in the size of a lobulated right lower lobe lung
lesion.
4. Stable compression deformities of T11 and L1.
CT chest 4/10/8
IMPRESSION:
1. Two lung lesions are suspicious for malignancy, a 16-mm right
upper lobe lesion contiguous with an area of partially-resolved
pneumonia, unchanged since [**2191-2-25**] and a nearly 3 cm
subpleural right lower lobe mass increased in size slightly in
the interim.
2. Moderate-to-severe emphysema.
3. Multifocal pneumonia substantially cleared and pleural
effusions decreased or resolved.
4. One small liver lesion warranting ulstrasound study.

[**5-16**] CXR
 In comparison with the study of [**5-12**], the degree of pulmonary
vascular congestion has substantially decreased. Bilateral
pleural effusions are seen, much worse on the left. Probable
atelectatic changes at the bases, again more prominent on the
left. There is some patchy opacification just above the minor
fissure on the right. In view of the high fever, this could
represent a developing pneumonia and should be carefully
evaluated on subsequent studies.

[**5-17**] KUB
Air-fluid levels are consistent with ileus; no evidence of
complete bowel obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Red Surgery for management of her
SBO and abdominal pain.  The patient was initially managed
conservatively with NGT decompression and NPO status.  The
patient continued on TPN as she was on at home.  The patient
failed conservative management, so the decision was made to take
the patient to the operating room.  On [**5-8**], the patient
underwent a laparotomy, lysis of adhesion, enterocolostomy,small
bowel biopsy.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
complications and an EBL of 100cc.  For further detail of the
procedure please refer to the operative note.  Post operatively,
the patient was hypotensive and started on a Neo drip, and she
was then transfered to the TICU for further care.  On POD 2 the
patient was febrile to 103.8 and weaned off neo.  On [**5-11**], her
PICC was removed and TLC placed. GPC's were found in blood so
Vanco was started.  On [**5-12**], she developed new AF w/RVR, was
started on a dilt/lasix gtt, and an ECHO done was normal.
Furthermore, her Ucx was positive w/Ecoli so she was started on
cipro and later changed to Gent [**2-26**] fluoroquinolone resistance.
On [**5-14**] the patient was transfered to the floor in fair
condition and rate controlled.  The patient's discharge was
delayed secondary to physical therapy concerns about the
patient's independence status.  Furthermore, secondary to the
patient's poor po intake, TPN was continued.  On [**5-16**] the
patient spiked a temp to 101.5 and the CVL was d/c'd and the
patient maintained on D10W until PICC could be placed.  On [**5-19**],
the patient self d/c'd her PICC accidentally.  On [**5-20**] a PICC
was replaced via IR without complication.  Upon discharge, the
patient was afebrile with all vitals stable other than O2
saturation, ambulating on O2 independently, tolerating po feeds
but still on TPN, and with pain controlled on po pain
medication.

Physical therapy was consulted to help rehabilitate the patient.
 The patient progressed well with physical therapy, but the
ultimate decision was made to d/c the patient home with oxygen
[**2-26**] desaturations to the mid 80's on ambulation.

The spiculated lung mass found on CT was refered to
interventional pulmonology for work up and management.  The
patient will be managed as an outpatient and will be discussed
in multidisciplinary clinic.
