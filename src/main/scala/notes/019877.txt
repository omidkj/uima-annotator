Pre CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.

Post CPB:
A descending prosthetic aorta graft is seen.
There is preserved biventricular systolic function.
The visible contours of the ascending aorta are intact.
No AI, no MR.

  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

FINDINGS: Right parieto-occipital hematoma and adjacent
surrounding edema are
unchanged from prior study of [**2182-12-3**]. Hyperdensity in
the right
parietal sulci and right sylvian fissure are compatible with
evolving
subarachnoid hemorrhage. No new hemorrhage is noted. There is no
shift of
normally midline structures. The ventricles and sulci are stable
in size and
configuration from prior study. There is no evidence of
obstructive
hydrocephalus or uncal herniation.


IMPRESSION: Evolving right parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage and
right
parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hematoma. No new hemorrhage
is noted.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

IMPRESSION: Normal MRV of the head. Note should be made of
non-visualization
of the proximal right jugular vein which appears artifactual as
it is seen on
the source images.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following admission she underwent pre-op work up. On [**2182-11-27**]
she went to the Operating Room where graft repair was effected.
Right heart bypass was utilized with femoral cannulation and a
lumbar drain. She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition. Ultimately
extubated on POD #3. Lumbar drain also removed that day. Gently
diuresed toward her preop weight. POD #5 transferred to the
floor to begin increasing her activity level. Developed with
headache with serosanguinous drainage at lumbar drain site and
was transferred back to the CVICU for monitoring.Blood patch
done. Full MRI abandoned as she c/o back pain and panic.
Transferred back to floor on POD #8. Developed SVT alternating
with bradycardia on POD #[**8-26**] and EP consult done.  Reintubated
and taken for scanning per neuro recs. This revealed an evolving
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cipro started for UTI. MR completed
next day with no change. She continued to improve and was
extubated and transferred back to the floor on POD #10.

***Per neuro rec, no aspirin until repeat scan is done and seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) 404**]. Will need an open MRI of brain
scheduled by rehab provider in approx. one month. (She has
severe claustrophobia that required intubation for scanning as
an inpt).

Left thoracentesis done for pleural effusion done on POD #12. C.
diff. negative x3 so flagyl DCed. Made good progress and cleared
for discharge to [**Hospital3 **] in [**Hospital1 1559**] on POD #13. All f/u
appts were advised.
