Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old male with
multiple medical problems CAD status post CABG in [**2129**] with
known metastatic melanoma, who presented to an outside
hospital with shortness of breath and right leg pain.
Patient had a positive Myoview as an outpatient and was going
to be arranged for outpatient catheterization.  However, on
Friday he became acutely short of breath.  Reportedly grabbed
an inhaler from a stranger and used it feeling better.

Was admitted to an outside hospital on Friday and noted to
have a troponin-I peak at 0.15, CK 143 with a MB of 1.9.  A
BNP was 768.  He had no fever or chills.  He had multiple
falls last week, which were attributed to his chronic
Meniere's disease and dizziness.  Recent Myoview demonstrated
reversibility in the anterior apical/inferoseptal area with
global hypokinesis with an EF of 27%.  At the outside
hospital, the patient also had a head CT, which showed old
lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia bilaterally.  Bilateral
periventricular subcortical white matter hypodensities
consistent with small vessel ischemia.  No acute hemorrhage
or mass effect.  In addition, the patient had a lower
extremity ultrasound, which was negative for DVT.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Brother died of a MI in his 50's.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  His grandson
occasionally lives with him.  He quit tobacco.  No alcohol or
drugs.  He quit tobacco 30 years ago.

ALLERGIES:  Iodine dye and shellfish.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.7, blood pressure 158/80,
pulse of 73, respirations 18, and saturating 93% on room air.
General:  Alert and disoriented, oriented x1.  HEENT:  Right
pupil was larger than his left, which is chronic.  Moist
mucous membranes.  Jugular venous pressure at 8 cm.  Heart
was regular, S1, S2, no murmurs.  Lungs:  Decreased air
movement at the bases, no crackles.  Abdomen was soft, obese,
nontender, and bowel sounds present.  Extremities:  Right
lower extremity with 2+ pitting edema to the thigh, increased
warmth, erythema of the right foot and patches of erythema of
the right leg and trace edema in the left lower extremity.

LABORATORIES:  Potassium 4.1, BUN 13, creatinine 1.1, bicarb
30.  Hematocrit 35.4, platelets 238.

EKG showed a sinus rhythm at a rate of 92 with a right bundle
branch block.

Patient was admitted and his hospital course was significant
for the following issues:  Patient was supposed to undergo
catheterization on the 5th, however, this was postponed until
the 6th.  On the night of the 5th, the patient received some
IV diuresis.  His shortness of breath was thought to be
likely due to CHF essentially due to ischemia versus
exacerbation of his asthma and COPD.  He was diuresed with
some improvement in his shortness of breath.  He was
maintained on his [**Last Name (un) **] and Atrovent nebulizers.  He was
premedicated for catheterization with Solu-Medrol.

The following day he went for a cardiac catheterization with
severe native three-vessel disease, severe biventricular
diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension,
depressed cardiac index, culprit stenoses in the SVG to AM
PDA.  Patient received two bare-metal stents to the SVG to
PDA.  He was also noted to have elevated filling pressures on
the catheterization, both left and right-sided.  He returned
to the floor after his catheterization, and was noted to be
very disoriented, very aggressive sitting up.  His 8 French
sheath still in his right femoral artery.

Six to eight persons were required to keep the patient still.
He received 10 of IV Haldol, 50 of Fentanyl with some
calming effect, however, became even more aggressive and
refused to lie still.  A code purple was called, and the
patient was put in leather restraints.  Decision was made to
electively intubate the patient since he needed to lay still
for eight hours given the risk of bleeding in his right
groin, and the concern of an expanding hematoma in his right
thigh.  Anesthesia was called for intubation, and the patient
was transferred to the CCU for further management.  The
family was appraised of these developments.

In the CCU, the patient was gently hydrated.  His hematocrit
was noted to be stable with no acute drop.  He was quickly
weaned from the vent and extubated the following morning, and
returned to the floor.

An echocardiogram on [**3-25**] revealed an EF of 25%, elongated
left atrium, markedly dilated right atrium, moderate LVH,
overall left ventricular systolic function was severely
depressed with global hypokinesis.  Right ventricular
systolic function also appeared depressed, mild AR, mild MR
with no pericardial effusion, just borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

The patient was then transferred back to the floor, where he
remained disoriented, but alert and cooperative.  His
disorientation was thought to likely be secondary to
delirium, secondary to medication toxicity, or steroids, or
Benadryl received prior to the catheterization.  Upon return
to the floor, he was restarted on his psychiatric
medications, but benzodiazepines and narcotics were held.

Regarding his CAD, he had status post stents x2 to the PDA.
He was continued on atorvastatin, metoprolol, and losartan,
aspirin, and Plavix.  He had a small groin hematoma, which
was stable and his hematocrit remained stable throughout the
rest of his hospital course.

CHF:  The patient had severe diastolic and systolic
dysfunction by cardiac catheterization, and appeared somewhat
fluid overloaded.  He was initially on 40 of IV Lasix b.i.d,
which was changed to p.o. once the patient no longer required
oxygen.  He was continued on metoprolol for heart rate
control given his history of diastolic dysfunction.  A chest
x-ray on [**3-26**] revealed low lung volumes with bibasilar
atelectasis, but no evidence of fluid overload.

Fever:  The patient had spiked a fever to 101.5 while in the
CCU.  He was continued on diclox for his chronic cellulitis,
which he takes chronically b.i.d.  He had no further fevers
for at least 48 hours prior to discharge.  Blood cultures
showed no growth to date.  Sputum culture was also negative.
Multiple urine cultures were also negative.

Asthma:  The patient was continued on albuterol, ipratropium,
and Montelukast, and also restarted on fluticasone b.i.d.

BPH:  Patient had a Foley in place.  He was continued on
doxazosin and Detrol.

Prior to discharge, the patient was still somewhat confused,
however, oriented x2-3.  He denied any chest pain or
shortness of breath.  He was seen by Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy, who recommended rehab.  The patient was
asked to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 93785**], his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] an appointment
was made for [**4-8**] at 1 p.m.  He is also asked to followup
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] within two weeks.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease status
