Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. Muscular
VSD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV wall thickness. Mildly dilated RV
cavity. Normal RV systolic function.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis (MVR). MVR
well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring. Normal tricuspid valve
supporting structures. Mild [1+] TR. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Abnormal PVR. Normal main PA.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF60-70%). There is a possible muscular ventricular septal
defect (VSD). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A
bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is
present. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The pulmonic prosthesis is abnormal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2199-12-16**], the mitral, tricuspid, and pulmonic valves
have been repaired/replaced.
