Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
84yo woman with h/o HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DCIS s/p
resection & XRT who presented on [**2191-2-11**] w/ productive cough and
SOB. The cough has been present for 1-2months, and seems to have
worsened recently. Pt was seen in her PCPs office for eval of
cough. Her VS were T 99.1, BP 100/60, HR 100, RR 40, O2 91% RA
and had crackles on lung exam (per report). She was referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for tx of possible PNA.
.
Pt denied fevers at home, sick contacts, does not recall if she
received the flu vaccine this year. ROS notable for decreased
appetite and possible wt loss, though not clear how much.
.
In ED, initial vitals were: T 100.4, HR 90, BP 120/50, RR 20, O2
95% on 4L NC. Pt was noted to have rhonchi at RLL. Labs notable
for ABG: 7.32/43/57/23. Lactate nl, WBC 9.8 w/ 90% neutrophils.
CXR notable for small bilateral pleural effusions with
associated atalectasis. U/A positive. Pt had decreasing O2 sat
during ED course requiring placement of NRB --> CPAP. Also, had
episode of hypotension w/ drop in SBP to 80's. R IJ was placed
and pt received 3L NS w/ good response. She also received
levoflox 750mg PO x 1 in ED for possible PNA as well as tx of
UTI.
.
In the MICU, the patient was weaned off of CPAP and was
eventually able to tolerate 4L NC, which she is currently on.
She required no pressors. Following 3L IVF, her BP improved to
the 90s-110s. She underwent a CTA to r/o PE. No PE was seen.
There was, however, near complete collapse of the right and left
lower lobe likely due to "soft tissue and fluid density" within
the lower lobe bronchi (possibly mucous vs. endoluminal lesion).
A patchy opacity was seen in the RUL, which [**Hospital1 **] read as
concerning for PNA. Given the patient's social hx (born &
travelled in [**Country 651**]), TB was raised as possible etiology for
current presentation. She was placed in isolation room. She has
undergone one sputum for DFA, which is negative. Her antibiotics
were changed from levoflox to CTX/azitrho to minimize potential
for suppression of MTB, if that is the cause of her sx's. Her
blood cx's are NGTD and urine cx was negative for growth.
.
On arrival to wards, pt reports feeling better. Cough is still
present and productive of yellow-whitish sputum. She denies
CP/SOB/abd pain/n/v/d. No dysuria.

studies:
CTA:
1.  Large amount of atelectasis, with complete collapse of the
right lower
lobe and near complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
Underlying infection cannot be excluded.  Bronchoscopy could be
helpful for further evaluation, especially given the  dense
material within the lower lobe bronchi.
2.  Patchy opacities seen in the right upper lobe,  consistent
with pneumonia.
3.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
.
CXR ([**2-12**]):
There has been no radiographic change.  An irregular area of
heterogeneous
opacity at the left lung base could represent pneumonia,
alternatively
atelectasis, unchanged in configuration since earlier in the day
on [**2-11**], but not since 6:06 p.m.  Opacification at the
right lung base is more likely pleural effusion and atelectasis,
and not pneumonia.  On the other hand there is a new region of
heterogeneous opacity in the right upper lung projecting over
the head of the clavicle which could be superimposition of the
bones and a dilated upper lobe and mediastinal vessels, but
should be re-examined later in the day as a second possible
focus of infection.  Moderate cardiomegaly unchanged.  Right
internal jugular line ends at the superior cavoatrial junction.
No pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2191-2-11**] 12:59 PM
AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 1310 HOURS: Hazy
opacity overlies the right lower lung, somewhat obscuring the
right hemidiaphragm. No obvious pleural effusion is seen;
however, small bilateral layering pleural effusions with
adjacent atalectasis may be present. Additionally, retrocardiac
linear opacities represent atalectasis.
Given the relatively lower lung volumes on the current study
compared to the prior study, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged, demonstrating cardiomegaly. There is no hilar
lymphadenopathy. The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Soft
tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSIONS: No pneumonia. Possible small bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atalectasis.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2191-2-12**] 3:50 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to 6:06 p.m. [**2-11**]:
There has been no radiographic change. An irregular area of
heterogeneous opacity at the left lung base could represent
pneumonia, alternatively atelectasis, unchanged in configuration
since earlier in the day on [**2-11**], but not since 6:06 p.m.
Opacification at the right lung base is more likely pleural
effusion and atelectasis, and not pneumonia. On the other hand
there is a new region of heterogeneous opacity in the right
upper lung projecting over the head of the clavicle which could
be superimposition of the bones and a dilated upper lobe and
mediastinal vessels, but should be re-examined later in the day
as a second possible focus of infection. Moderate cardiomegaly
unchanged. Right internal jugular line ends at the superior
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2191-2-14**] 9:53 AM
Comparison is made to [**2191-2-12**]. There has been considerable
interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions and
associated atelectases. A small residual right-sided pleural
effusion is present. A consolidation in the right upper lobe
persists, but has partly resolved. Moderate cardiomegaly and
calcifications in the aortic arch are unchanged. No
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in pleural effusions and right
upper lobe consolidation.
