Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Possible PEA Arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 89 yo male with a history of DM2, HTN, slow
AFib, and poor functional capacity who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] after
sustaining a questionable PEA arrest at his opthomologist's
office on [**2145-3-8**]. Per the patient's daughter, after hurrying
him across the road because of oncoming traffic, he acutely
developed lethargy and went to sit down in a hunched over
position. He was apparently unresponsive for 2-3 minutes and
then [**Name8 (MD) **] RN came by and called EMS, which arrived within 3
minutes per the patient's daughter.
.
When EMS arrived, their initial documented HR [**Location (un) 1131**] was a
pulse of 26. After transfer to the stretcher, he was reportedly
pulseless and CPR was initiated (5 min), his monitor reported
pulse in the 20s and he was given atropine for presumed PEA. Per
report, he was also apneic, and hence was intubated int he
field. His HR subsequently rose to 58 and then was 110 on his
arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED (AFib). He was reportedly also agitated
from his intubation.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], his HR was in the 80s. He was started on
propofol gtt (as he was not sedated in the field). His pressure
dropped to 75/25, and his HR dropped to 55. It was presumed that
his BP decrement was due to the bradycardia, and thus was given
atropine and the propofol discontinued. He was given a 2nd mg of
atropine because his HR was still in the 50s; and started on
fentanyl gtt and versed for sedation.

He had a femoral line placed and dopamine infusion was begun b/c
of of BP in the 80s-90s and hr in the 40s.
.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED; he had an ECHO which showed
R heart strain; however, a subsequent PE protocol CT did not
find evidence of an acute PE; evidence of chronic PE was found.
He was intubated for altered mental status and undertook a trip
to the cardiac catheterization laboratory which found him to
have:
- elevated RV and PA pressures.
- he was also started on heparin gtt and given ASA 325.
.
Of note, he was taken off of his ASA for 4 days prior to his
opthamologic surgery. He was also not being anticoagulated for
his known AFib.

CTA [**2145-3-8**]:
1.  No acute PE.  Findings suggestive of chronic PE.
2.  Endotracheal tube terminates 1.5 cm from the carina.  Pull
black is recommended.
3.  Acute angulation of bilateral anterior ribs.  Recommend
clinical
correlation for acute injury possibly related to recent
resuscitative efforts.
4.  Extensive coronary artery disease.
5.  Possible interstitial lung disease versus interstitial
engorgement in the setting of recent cardiac arrest.  Followup
imaging may be useful once clinically stabilized.
.
[**3-17**] EEG:
Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized
background and bursts of generalized slowing. These findings
indicate a
widespread encephalopathy affecting both cortical and
subcortical
structures. Anoxia is a possible explanation of the
encephalopathy.
Medications, infection, and metabolic disturbances can also
contribute.
There were no areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were
no
epileptiform features.


Brief Hospital Course:
(1) POSSIBLE PEA ARREST
From accounts from EMS, it appeared that Mr. [**Known lastname **] had a PEA
arrest while running across the street. However, it did not take
long to rescucitate the patient in the field, so it is unclear
whether he had an actual arrest.  Given his chronic PE and high
PA & RV pressures, it is likely that he could not match the
demand from his episode of exertion, leading to hypoxia which
may have been the predisposing factor to his PEA.  In addition,
the patient has poor functional status, and along with his known
CAD and DM, demand ischemia could have potentially led to his
PEA.  Given his CKD and dye load with CTA and right heart cath,
detailed inspection of his coronary anatomy was not pursued.
.
He was continued on aspirin and atrovastatin during his
hospitalization. ECHO showed moderately dilated right ventricle
with m
