History of Present Illness:
63 y/o male with recent episode of s. viridans endocarditis in
[**2148-10-5**]. Since that time he has completed a course of IV
antibiotics and extensive dental work. Follow-up echo showed
severe mitral regurgitation and he has also developed atrial
fibrillation. He conitnues to have dyspnea on exertion and

Physical Exam:
VS: 90 5'7" 102kg
Gen: Well-appearing male in NAD
Skin: W/D intact
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, NCAT
Neck: Supple, FROM -JVD, -carotid bruit
Chest: CTAB -w/r/r
Heart: Irreg-reg rhythm
Abd: Soft, NT, ND +BS
Ext: Warm, well-perfused, minimal edema, -varicosities
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**1-16**] Echo: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. 2. A patent
foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. 3. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is top normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] 4. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. 6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail seen of the P2 leaflet. The mitral valve leaflets
do not fully coapt. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Torn mitral chordae are present. The mitral regurgitation
vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. POST-CPB: On infusions of milrinone, epi, neo. Well-seated
mechanical valve in the mitral position. Normal washing jets.
Gradient of 9 mmHg at CCO of 7.0 liters/min. Difficult to assess
LV function due to poor windows. Trivial residual PFO remains
post closure. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an out-patient. On day of admission he
was brought directly to the operating room where he underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 2, mitral valve replacement, MAZE
procedure, PFO closure, and left atrial appendage ligation.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. On post-operative day one he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-op day 2 his chest tubes were removed. Amiodarone was
restarted. On post-op day three beta blockers and diuretics were
started and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight.
Coumadin was also initiated with a Heparin bridge until
patient's INR was at a therapeutic level. His epicardial pacing
wires were removed and he was transferred to the step down
floor. He did well postoperatively, awaited therapeutic INR and
was ready for discharge home with PT on POD #9.
Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who agreed to follow his coumadin.
