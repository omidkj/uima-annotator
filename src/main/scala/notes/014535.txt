Cardiac catheterization with one stent placed.


History of Present Illness:
43 y/o male with h/o HTN who developed SSCP nonradiating
associated with arm/feet tingling around 12:30PM. He felt a
similar pain 1 month ago after being involved in a fight and
being punched in the chest. No past history of DOE, orthopnea,

SSCP and he pulled over and called the ambulance. He was taken
to [**Hospital3 **] and his EKG revealed STE in anterolateral

Reports:
1. Cardiac cath [**2145-9-7**]
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
single vessel CAD. The LMCA had no angiographic evidence of flow
limiting stenosis. The LAD had a 99% proximal occlusion with
freshthrombus which was excised with an exciser and export
catheter.The LCXhadnoangiographic evidence of flow limiting
stenosis. The RCA was a
dominant vessel and had no angiographic evidence of flow
limiting
stenosis. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and right
sided filling
pressures. Left ventriculography was deferred. Successful
thrombectomy was performed with an Exciser and Export catheters
in the proximal LAD.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LAD was performed with a 3.5x18mm Cypher stent
postdilated to 4.0 mm.  Residual distal LAD thrombus partially
lysed with manual manipulation.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left and right sided filling pressures.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute
ptca/stenting
and thrombectomy of the LAD.
.
2. Echo [**2145-9-8**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis
of the distal
half of the anterior septum and anterior walls and distal
inferior wall. The
apex is mildly anerysmal and mildly dyskinetic. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The remaining left
ventricular segments contract
normally. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. LV WALL MOTION:
Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: mid anterior -
hypo; mid anteroseptal - hypo; anterior apex - akinetic; septal
apex- akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic; apex - dyskinetic;
remaining LV segments contract normally.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
moderate regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD lesion).
Mild mitral regurgitation. EF 35%

Brief Hospital Course:
43 y/o male with h/o HTN who presented to OSH with STEMI and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and management.
The following issues were addressed during this hospitalization.
.
1. Cardiac/Ischemia/Pump
The patient was found to have an STEMI at OSH and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and management.
He was found to have a large proximal LAD lesion which was
stented with a Cypher stent x 1 and underwent thrombectomy. He
was transferred to the CCU post-cath on a nitro gtt for further
monitoring and management. He still c/o chest pain post-cath but
resolved within several hours. Nitro gtt was weaned and he was
started on oral BP agents. He was maintained on ASA 325 mg PO
daily and Plavix 75 mg PO daily. He was on an integrillin gtt
post cath which remained for 48 hours post-cath secondary to
large thrombus componenet to LAD lesion. He was started on a BB
and ACEI. He was continuously monitored on telemetry. He had an
echo performed the next day after cath which revealed apical
akinesis and he was started on a heparin gtt for prevention of
thrombus formation. Once he was clinically improved, he was
transferred to the floor. He was started on Coumadin and was
discharged on Lovenox for bridging. He will need to have his INR
followed as an outpatient by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will continue Lovenox
until INR is in target range. He will need another echo for
evaluation of cardiac function in approximately 6 months. He was
started on atorvastatin 80 mg daily and that will be managed as
an outpatiet by PCP and cardiology follow up. Cholesterol levels
were sent and the results are above. Due to patient's age and
relative lack of risk factors, a urine tox screen was sent and
was negative for cocaine. It should be noted that the patient
was a very poor historian. Further risk stratification will be
performed as an outpatient. PT evaluated the patient and cleared
him to return home. He will need outpatient cardiac rehab
coordinated by his PCP.
.
2. Anemia
The patient was found to be anemic on admission. His HCT
remained stable throughout admission and started to trend
upward. The patient came with no outside records and was a poor
historian. Iron studies revealed normal iron level, TIBC of 263,
Ferritin 308. The pattern is consistent with anemia of chronic
disease but unclear etiology. Further workup of patient's anemia
will need to be done by his PCP as an outpatient.
