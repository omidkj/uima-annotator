Results:
CXR [**2122-10-2**]:
1. Persistent moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion with
compression atelectasis. Underlying consolidation cannot be
excluded.
2. No evidence of fluid overload.
.
LE U/S [**2122-10-3**]:
Occlusive left-sided DVT involving the left common femoral,
superficial femoral and popliteal veins. Non-occlusive thrombus
seen within the right common femoral vein, in the region of the
junction with the greater saphenous vein.
.
CTA chest [**2122-10-3**]:
1. Non-occlusive pulmonary embolus within the right upper lobe
pulmonary artery, without associated findings to suggest
infarct. .
2. Small left and moderate right pleural effusions.
3. 2-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule, for which no
additional followup is required in a patient without a history
of malignancy or increased risk for lung cancer.
4. Anasarca.
5. Ascending thoracic aorta diameter at upper limits of normal
at 4 cm.
.
MRI/A Brain w/o contrast [**2122-10-4**]
Limited examination secondary to motion artifact, however there
is evidence of vascular signal in both internal carotids as well
as the
vertebrobasilar system, the distal branches are not completely
visualized likely secondary to motion artifact and combination
of atherosclerotic disease in the distal vascular branches.
.
Abdominal U/s complete [**2122-10-6**]
1.  Markedly improved appearance in gallbladder wall edema from
prior study of [**12-3**].
2.  Interval development of fatty infiltration of the liver.
Other forms of diffuse liver disease including cirrhosis,
fibrosis, and possible long-term steroid use can result in this
appearance.
3.  Echogenic, atrophic kidneys.
4.  Large right pleural effusion.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2122-10-15**]
1.  No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
2.  Stable left renal hypodensity, which is too small to further
characterize but likely a cyst.
3.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions which
measure simple fluid density.  No evidence of pneumonia.
.
U/s RUE venous ultrasound [**2122-10-20**]
Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate no right upper extremity
DVT.
Note of an occluded AV fistula within the right antecubital
fossa.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
66F h/o SLE, ESRD on HD, PVD, chronic atypical chest pain, and
CVA, recently worked up for tachypnea and electrolyte
abnormalities, admitted for tachypnea, and found to have PE/DVTs
and coagulopathy.
.
# Hypoglycemia: During her inpatient stay she has had
hypoglycemia in 20s and 40s. Hypoglycemia is likely
multifactorial due to ESRD, s/p gatrectomy, and possible
cirrhosis due to hx of ETOH abuse and poor oral intake.
Insulinoma, although unlikely, was ruled out with normal insulin
levels.  Patient was also treated with TPN and her hypoglycemia
subsequently improved.  TPN was discontinued on [**2122-10-19**] with
the placement of a post-pyloric NGT for continued feeding.  She
additionally has had an increased appetite the last several days
with the addtion of Megace.  No hypoglycemic events for some
time prior to discharge.  Thus, will discharge on continued tube
feeding and a regular diet with continued nutrition evaluation
via qweek albumen levels.  Does not need fingersticks
