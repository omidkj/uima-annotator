PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium is dilated.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Right ventricular chamber size is moderately dilated and there
is mild global hypokinesis.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname **]
[**Known lastname 732**].

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine infusions
0.02 mcg/kg/min, phenylephrine 1.0 mcg/kg/min

Intact thoracic aorta. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild
tricusid regurgitation.
There is a bioprosthesis in the native aortic position, stable
and functioning well with no residual regurgitation. The mean
gradient is 15mm post replacement.
Mild global RV hypokinesis.
LV systolic function is mildly improved with LVEF 45%.
Mild mitral regurgitation.
Mild .

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted [**2105-1-13**] for further preop workup.
Carotid scan revealed <40% stenosis bilaterally.  Dental
clearance was obtained.  Heparin was initiated for atrial
fibrillation.  Echo revealed critical aortic stenosis with
aortic valve area <0.8cm2, 2+ mitral regurgitation and ejection
fraction 50-55%.  Sleep medicine was consulted for a question of
obstructive sleep apnea.  CPAP was recommended and this was
initiated.  The patient was brought to the operating room on
[**2105-1-19**] for redo sternotomy, aortic valve replacement with St.
[**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue valve.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU on Neo,
epinephrine and propofol for further observation and invasive
monitoring.  The epinephrine drip was weaned off, and the
patient acutely decompensated, becoming hemodynamically unstable
with a metabolic acidosis.  He was volume resuscitated with
colloid and 4 units packed red blood cells.  He was further
treated with levophed, epinephrine, calcium and bicarbonate.
TEE was performed.  Atrial fibrillation ensued and he was
cardioverted and subsequently paced.  Right femoral line was
placed.  The patient stabilized.  He was extubated on POD 1,
hemodynamics stabilized and he awoke neurologically intact.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  Coumadin was initiated for atrial fibrillation.
He progressed and was transferred to the step down floor for
further recovery.  He was gently diuresed toward his
preoperative weight.  Low dose beta blockade was initiated in
light of bradycardia.  He was evaluated by physical therapy.  By
POD 7 he was cleared by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for discharge to rehab.
