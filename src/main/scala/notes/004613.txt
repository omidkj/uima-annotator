Service:  MED


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 87 year old,
Spanish speaking, elderly, male patient with end stage
dementia, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 20 percent, coronary artery disease status post PTCA in
[**2147**], who was transferred from [**Hospital3 537**] with increasing
white blood cells, tachycardia and hypoxia.  The patient was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**3-22**] to [**3-27**] with
pneumonia and was treated with a 10 day course of ceftriaxone
and Flagyl.  His hospital course was complicated by CHF with
an elevated BNP (1273) with an ejection fraction noted to be
20 percent.  Coumadin was not initiated at that time
secondary to fall risk and AICD placement was not pursued
secondary to dementia.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 15416**] and had been doing well until he was noted to have a
increasing white blood cell count with low grade fever.  The
patient was tachycardia to a heart rate in the 100s and
hypoxic to 80 percent in room air.  On questioning, his
family denies any further complaints from the patient, who is
minimally communicative at baseline.

In the emergency department the patient had a chest x-ray
which showed increasing pneumonia and CHF.  He was started on
vancomycin, cefepime and Flagyl for worsening pneumonia and
concern for sepsis once his systolic blood pressure decreased
to 60/palp.  He was admitted to the MICU service.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient previously lived alone with
nursing assistance, but was recently discharged to [**Hospital3 15416**] from the hospitalization earlier this month.  The
patient has an 80 pack year smoking history.  He walks with a
walker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.4, systolic blood
pressure 98 to 110, pulse 109, 96 percent on 4 liters.  In
general, somnolent, alert and oriented times one,
intermittently responds appropriately to questions, in no
acute respiratory distress.  Extremities very warm.  Speaking
in full sentences.  HEENT pupils equal, round, reactive to
light.  Sclerae were anicteric.  The patient had dry mucous
membranes and was edentulous.  Neck supple, no evidence of
lymphadenopathy.  Chest there were diffuse crackles with mild
wheezing throughout all lung fields.  There was no evidence
of accessory muscle use.  Heart tachycardia with regular
rhythm, no evidence of murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen
soft, nondistended, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities warm, thready radial pulses,
no edema, palpable pedal pulses.  There was no evidence of
edema.  Neuro somnolent, oriented times one.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cells 20.9 (91 percent
neutrophils, 6 percent lymphocytes), hematocrit 34.6,
platelets 316.  PT 13.8, PTT 27.2, INR 1.3.  Sodium 137,
potassium 5.2, chloride 101, bicarb 27, BUN 51, creatinine
2.1, glucose 259.  CK 84.  ALT 9, AST 13, amylase 52, alka
phos 61, total bili 0.3.  Chest x-ray diffuse interstitial
opacities left greater than right unchanged from [**3-26**].  CT
scan ([**3-26**]) diffuse peripheral reticular pattern with patchy
ground glass and no discrete nodules with some superimposed
edema versus infection.  No evidence of pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypoxic respiratory distress.  In the emergency department
   the patient was noted to be hypoxic in mild respiratory
   distress.  The etiology of the patient's respiratory
   distress was considered likely secondary to pneumonia in
   this patient with underlying structural lung disease in
   addition to flash pulmonary edema secondary to fluid
   hydration and his severe congestive heart failure.  The
   patient was started on supplemental oxygen by face mask
   and received morphine for tachypnea.  The patient was not
   intubated per his DNR/DNI orders and was admitted to the
   MICU where he was started on vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl
   and azithromycin for broad spectrum coverage.  The
   patient's oxygen saturation improved throughout his stay
   in the MICU and he was transferred to the medicine floor
The patient was
   eventually weaned from face mask to nasal cannula which he
   tolerated quite well.

1. Shock.  The patient was admitted to the MICU with
   hypotension concerning for septic shock with a presumed
   pulmonary source.  The patient's hypotension responded
   well to IV fluid resuscitation and as noted previously, he
   was started on empiric antibiotic coverage with cefepime
   for gram negatives and pseudomonal coverage, vancomycin
   empirically for MRSA given his recent hospitalization,
   Flagyl to cover anaerobes and azithromycin for atypical
   causes of pneumonia given the diffuse peripheral reticular
   pattern seen on his recent chest CT.  The patient's blood
   cultures were negative and after fluid resuscitation on
   admission, the patient was noted to be hemodynamically
   stable.

1. Heart failure.  The patient has a history of severe
   systolic heart failure with a concern for flash pulmonary
   edema on admission to the MICU.  Given the patient's
   hypotension, the ICU team held his Lasix and ACE
   inhibitor.  The patient was ruled out for an MI with
   enzymes and had no significant EKG changes.  The patient's
   antihypertensive medications were held throughout the
   remainder of his hospitalization.

1. Acute renal failure.  The patient was admitted in septic
   shock with creatinine of 2.1 and BUN to creatinine ratio
   over 20:1.  With fluid resuscitation the patient's
   creatinine improved and was 1.2 prior to discharge.  The
   etiology of the patient's renal failure is secondary to
   pre-renal azotemia from shock and dehydration.  The
   patient's ins and outs were followed throughout this
   admission.

1. Dementia.  The patient was admitted with a history of end
   stage dementia.  He was noted to repeat phrases multiple
   times and was minimally interactive.  Olanzapine was
   continued p.r.n. for agitation.

1. Adrenal insufficiency.  The patient had a cortisol level
   drawn on admission to the ICU that was 7.0, concerning for
   adrenal insufficiency.  He was continued on hydrocortisone
   and fludrocortisone for replacement therapy.  This was
   continued on the floor until the decision was made to make
   the patient CMO at which time these medications were
   discontinued.

1. Code status.  On admission to the medical floor a family
   meeting was held at which time the [**Hospital 228**] health care
   proxy and multiple family members voiced their desire for
   the patient to be comfort measures only.  The palliative
   care service was consulted and helped to arrange
   outpatient followup for the patient.
