continued management of likely meningitis.  Patient's history
dates back to [**Month (only) **] when he was experiencing cough and low

macular rash.  At that time he was started on levofloxacin and
instructed to present to the hospital for admission if he
continued to have fevers on this antibiotic.  He represented to

Brief Hospital Course:
# Meningitis: Initial DDX included most likely bacterial,
perhaps due to invasive strep pneumo given concurrent lobar
pneumonia; possibly viral given enteroviruses and adenoviruses
still prevalent due to the unusual winter; and less likely
zoonotics such as Rickettsia or ehrlichia (unlikely given
relatively short incubation periods with a rather distant
outdoor exposure).  CSF culture was negative, likely due to
pretreatment with antibiotics.  Rickettsial and ehrichia
antibodies do not suggest current, active infection.  Lyme
antibodies at the outside hospital were negative.  Patient had
significantly improved on the vanco/rifampin/doxy started at the
OSH.  ID recommended completing a 14 day course of meropenem
(reportedly covers Listeria; NO similar data for erbapenem),
vancomycin (q8h, vanco trough 16.1), and doxycycline.  A PICC
was placed for IV access for long term antibiotics.
.
# Rash/joint pain: Suspect serum sickness vs secondary to above
infection.  Patient's symptoms steadily improved with above
treatment.
.
# Transaminitis:  Suspect this is due to serum sickness vs above
infection.  Hepatitis B serologies consistent with prior
immunization and hepatitis C antibody negative.  HIV antibody
was negative.  Statin was held.  On the day of discharge: ALT
104, AST 73.  Consider outpatient imaging for possible NASH if
abnormalties persist.
.
# Coagulopathy:  Likely nutritional.  INR improved from 1.8->1.4
with vitamin K supplementation.  [**Month (only) 116**] be secondary to hepatic
dysfunction.  DIC panel was otherwise normal.
.
# Thrombophlebitis:  Patient developed multiple sites of
thrombophlebitis related to peripheral IVs.  With hot packs and
elevation, the redness and swelling improved.  He was instructed
to continue hot packs and elevation and to notify his PCP or to
go to the local ER if swelling or erythema worsened to rule out
a subsequent DVT.
.
# Normocytic anemia:  Hematocrit remained stable at 31-33.  Low
retic may be suggestive of BM suppression from active infection.
 High ferritin suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.  Folate,
B12 normal.  Recommend PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] for continued monitoring.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia:  Statin held.  Patient will follow-up
with his PCP to restart this medication once his LFTs normalize.
.
# PPX: SQ heparin
.
# FEN: Given low albumin and poor po intake, patient was advised
to take boost supplements [**Hospital1 **] until his po intake improves back
to normal
.
# Dispo: Patient discharged home with services for IV
antibiotics
