Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 60 y/o woman with severe COPD presenting with SOB, cough
likely COPD exacerbation, requiring intubation for respiratory
muscle fatigue.
.
1) COPD, acute exacerbation

In ED T 97.8, HR 94, BP 152/91, RR 20. Sat975 6L. Lung exam
diffuse expiratory wheeze and crackles. Given nebulizer
treatment continuous. Solumedrol 125 IV x 1. Mag 2 gram IV x 1.
Ceftriaxone 1 gram. Azithromycin given. EKG with NSR no acute
changes. CTA with no evidence of PE.  She was subsequently
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given need for continuous nebs, continuous
wheezing with need for face mask at 100%.

By the patient's history, she has had multiple COPD flares in
the past but none requiring intubation. She initially tolerated
BiPAP, however, experienced worsening distress and required
intubation [**8-30**], extubated [**9-6**] but then developed acute onset
of worsening respiratory distress.  She was also hypertensive to
SBPs 190s-200s, possible flash pulmonary edema  She was given
lasix with good diuresis, and started on labetolol & nitro drips
for BP control. At that point she underwent a trial of BiPAP
which after a short time she asked to discontinue the BiPAP and
made clear at that point that she did not want to go through
another intubation. Her family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and were in
agreement with patient's wishes not to pursue either noninvasive
or intubation and the decision was made to optimize medical
therapy including steroids, nebulizer treatments, and provide
morphine and ativan for symptomatic control of respiratory
distress.  She was on fentanyl patch as [**Name (NI) 3782**] for chronic ?rib
pain and this was titrated to 50 mcg/hr patch to help dyspnea as
well.  She and her daughters met with the palliative care NP
when she was tenuous in the ICU and they discussed various
options including hospice.  The pt has made it clear that being
at home is a priority, though at this time her daughters have
work obligations that make it difficult for someone to be home
with her.

Fortunately, the pt's respiratory status has improved
significantly and she is to go to rehab.  She has completed a 7
day course of Cefepime and Vancomycin ([**9-4**]) for empiric
coverage of pneumonia. Her chest X-ray showed no evidence of no
new infiltrate on CXR or evidence of pneumonia.  At this time
she is stable on [**12-31**] liters NC and breathing quite comfortably.
She is to continue her nebs, inhalers, and will complete a
steroid taper.

2) Leukocytosis: believed probably secondary to steroids.
Culture data shows no active infection.  One sputum showed
sparse aspergillus but she has improved clinically without
antifungal treatment and thus this was believed to be a
colonizer rather than pathogen.
.
3) CAD: no active symptoms.  SHe is to continue ASA, Plavix,
b-blocker statin, ACEi

4) HTN: episode elevated BP but now stable on the floor.  She is
on metoprolol, lisinopril.
.
5) Osteoporosis:
- Continue bisphosphonate.  Her calcium has been temporarily
held due to a few low phosphorous readings, but if this resolved
in future she can resume Ca supplements
.
6) Depression: continue Nortriptyline

7) Urinary retention: pt experienced several episodes of urinary
retention on the floor after her ICU foley was removed.
Possibly secondary to having recent foley vs. opioid.  She was
straight cathed intermittently but was able to urinate the day
of discharge. We would like to avoid foley if necessary.  UOP
should be followed carefully at rehab.

8) Prophylaxis: she was initially on Hep SQ but this was
discontinued due to her tendency to have prolonged ooze/bleed
from injection sites (pt on ASA, Plavix).  She was changed to
sequential compression devices

She was given influenza vaccine this admission.  She reports she
received the pneumovax within the last 1-2 years.
.
Code status:
Do not resuscitate (DNR/DNI), discussed with Ms. [**Known lastname 17327**] and
daughters, decided on [**2204-9-6**].  Confirmed again when
transferred to the floor.
