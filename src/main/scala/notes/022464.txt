History of Present Illness:
76F with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, HTN, Asthma who was
transferred from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for management of respiratory
distress/Pneumonia. Pt was visiting from [**Location (un) 50955**], [**State 2690**]. She
arrived into [**Location (un) 86**] last Sun. According to the daughters, their
mother had +chest pain on Tuesday night. She took NTG with
relief of her pain, then experienced an "asthma attack". On [**11-2**]
they were walking with her mother outside when she began to
experience worsening SOB, +chest pain, took NTG x 2. She was
then taken to the [**Hospital1 882**] for further management. According to
the daughters, the patient has had +dry cough over the past few
days. They deny any recent fevers, N/V, abdominal pain or
diarrhea. +fevers in grandson. no [**Name2 (NI) **] contacts in [**Name (NI) 50955**].

.
At [**Hospital 882**] hospital, A CXR was done which per report showed
pulmonary infiltrates consistent with PNA. She was given
Vanco/Zosyn/solumedrol. Patient experienced worsening
respiratory distress and was intubated. She was transferred on
[**11-3**] with Trop T 0.9, ECG with LBBB. BNP from [**Hospital1 882**] was >
[**Numeric Identifier 2249**] so concern was for PE. CTA was done and showed no PE but
confirmed RLL consolidation. Cardiology was consulted and
reviewed ECG, believed Troponin leak [**1-29**] demand ischemia in
setting of PNA/Sepsis, did not recommend anticoagulation.
Patient was admitted to MICU for further management. Pt
subsequently tachycardic to 130s, then ~115, then abruptly comp
heart block with conversion of LBBB to RBBB morphology and shift
of axis from 20 to 116. Tracings reviewed by EP fellow
(&[**Doctor Last Name **]). Thought to be profound vagal episode with no clear
trigger. Change of bundle as her escape rhythm is fascicular in
origin. Subsequently tachy/brady. Had introducer placed in RIJ
and temp pacer floated into RV apex (rescue rate =60). In the
interim, CK's started climbing, likely [**1-29**] to rate and s/p
extubation. Started on esmolol initially with limited effect,
but as of this AM, pacer dependent at rate of 60. TEE without
endocarditis or root abcess, 1+AR and [**12-29**]+MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 100787**]
negative. [**Last Name (Titles) 7792**] was substantial with CKMB 131, Trp up to 7.3,
was placed on heparin drip, ASA, lipitor 80, plavix (continued
from home); esmolol/pacer for rate control. had IJ pulled due to
persistent oozing and HCT 27, stopped heparin gtt, also guaiac
positive, cdiff neg. next, went into Afib with rate in 100-120s,
treated with IV lopressor boluses and po metoprolol 37.5 tid.
received 4U pRBC transfusions in MICU for HCT in mid/high 20s.
completed course of vanc/CFTX, although for unclear reasons WBC
increasing, temp pacer pulled (tip not cultured).
.
The patient was transferred to the floor and underwent cath (no
interventions performed) and pacer placement, then became
hypotensive on the floor ([**11-16**]) with limited IV access while
working with PT though per report, recovered when supine. She
was also noted to have oliguria. She was transferred back to the
MICU for hypotension not responsive to fluid boluses on the
floor. She was initially restarted on broad spectrum abx but
these were discontinued as she did not have any localizing signs
of infection. In the ICU, she received approximately 5 L of IVF
in total as she was not responsive to intermittent boluses. She
also rec'd 2 units of prbcs for her continued anemia and likely
slow GI bleed. She became significantly volume overloaded and
required a lasix gtt with pressor support up until the day prior
to transfer back to [**Hospital1 1516**]. She was 1.5L negative since midnight
last night and 3.5L positive LOS in the MICU. She has maintained
her pressures over the last 24 hours. On transfer, she denies
any pain, SOB, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation,
diarrhea, or other symptoms.
