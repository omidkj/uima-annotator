Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Flank Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
74 year old male with no significant past medical history who
presents to OSH with left flank pain associated with nausea and
3 episodes of non-bloody emesis after having a mechanical fall
yesterday morning while getting out of bed.  Denies fevers,
chest pain, dyspnea, cough, dysuria, melena, hematochezia.
.
He was noted to have EKG at OSH hospital which was read as
anterior STEMI with STE in V1-V2 and depressions in inferior
leads concerning for anterior STEMI.  He was started on heparin
drip with bolus and given nitroglcyerin which caused transient
hypotension. He was given morphine as well though no aspirin was
noted to have been given and no imaging studies were performed.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] initial vitals were HR:90 with SBP of 120.  Labs were
significant for Hct 32.7, WBC 14.6, lactate 4.4 and creatinine
1.5. A CT torso demonstrated a large left subcapsular renal
hematoma with active extravasation extending to retroperitoneum.
An EKG demonstrated mild ST elevations in V1-V2. He was given
protamin 15mg to reverse his coagulopathy from IV heparin.  A
Urology consult was placed who recommended q6hr hct and
admission to the MICU overnight with recommendation for repeat
CT in the morning and IR if unstable. He was given 2LNS and 1
unit of PRBC in the ED and transferred to MICU for further
evaluation and management.  Cards evaluated the patient and
thought there was no STEMI and with negative troponins with no
clinical presentation of chest pain they were not concerned for
active ischemia. Vitals prior to transfer were 117 140/95 16
95%RA
.
.
On arrival to the ICU,  he reports having left flank pain but no
other complaints.

Imaging

CTA Chest/AP [**12-5**]
Large left renal subcapsular hematoma with active extravasation
extension into the retroperitoneum. In the absence trauma or
bleeding disorder, further imaging with MRI is recommended one
the patient is stable to
exclude an underlying mass lesion such as angiomyolipoma.

Renal Angiogram [**12-6**]
1. Normal arterial anatomy on selective left renal arteriogram.
2. Specifically, no active arterial extravasation or
pseudoaneurysm is
detected to warrant percutaneous transarterial embolotherapy.


TTE [**12-12**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
discrete vegetations are seen. Very mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Very mild aortic regurgitation with mild aortic
valve sclerosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function.

LENI [**12-13**]
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left leg.

FOOT [**12-16**]
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture.

Video Swallow [**12-13**]
Aspiration with thin liquids and penetration with
nectar-thickened liquids

Video Swallow: [**12-16**]
IMPRESSION: Aspiration with thin liquids and penetration with
nectar-thickened liquids, unchanged from prior.

Discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
74 year old male with no significant past medical history who
presents to OSH with left flank pain thought to be anterior
STEMI s/p heparin bolus + gtt complicated by worsening massive
subcapsular renal bleed extending into retroperitoneum. His
course was further complicated by EtOH withdrawal and [**Last Name (un) **]. He is
discharged to rehab with stable, constant flank/abdominal pain
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] delirium

BY ISSUE
# retroperitoneal bleed:  CT found to have left subcapsular
renal hematoma extending into retroperitoneum likely due to
ruptured renal cyst s/p falling.  Also likely related to heparin
drip that was started at OSH for possibility of ACS.  Upon
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient's heparin was stopped, HCT
monitored every 6 hours.  IR and Urology were both following the
patient while in the unit. The patient was initially actively
bleeding while in the unit.  Required 3U PRBCs.  Angiogram on
[**12-6**] showed that there was no renal artery stenosis and there
were no bleeding vessels to embolize.  His pain was controlled
with with various analgesics and was stable/constant on
discharge
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Cr was 1.5 on admission and peaked at 1.7; baseline Cr
was normal.  [**Last Name (un) **] was likely due to prerenal etiology in setting
of retroperitoneal hematoma.  The patient was fluid resuscitated
and his creatinine was trended.  Upon transfer out of the MICU,
his creat had stabilized and was at baseline by time of
discharge.
.
# Alcohol withdrawal: After the RP bleed was stabilized, the
patient began to show clinical signs of withdrawal, including
hallucinations, hypertension, and tachycardia.  He was started
on CIWA scale and given diazepam 10-20 mg q1h PRN and lorazepam
1 mg for breakthrough anxiety.  The patient initially had
hallucinations, which improved after benzo t
