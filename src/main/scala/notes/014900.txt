History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 9483**] is an 81 yoF with a h/o [**Known lastname 9215**], COPD (FEV1 48%P;
FEV1/FVC 72%P), eosinophilic lung disease, AT and recent C. Diff
colitis x 2 who presented to the ED from home today for
evaluation of shortness of breath. The patient reports that she
has had a sense of head congestion with rhinorrea for the last
three days, associated with some progressive dyspnea. She has
also had a chronic cough for the last six months, but it has
become productive of yellowish sputum. Today, the patient had a
mechanical fall while ambulating with her walker and hit her
left chest. EMS was called to the patient's home, however she
felt well at the time of their evaluation and did not go to the
ED. Later in the day, with increasing dyspnea, she did decided
to come to the ED.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.1, 79, 106/57, 20, 98% on RA.
She was treated with nebs and PO prednisone and apparently
appeared well. She was offered the opportunity for discharge
with PCP f/u, however indicated she would feel more comfortable
with admission. On arrival to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**], the patient was
quickly noted to be in severe respiratory distress. Additional
nebs were administered along with methylprednisolone. The
patient was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was
initially unable to provide much history secondary to her
respiratory distress. Emperic BPAP was initiated, which the
patient tolerated well. Within 15 minutes, she had improved
markedly and was able to begin answering some questions. During
this period, she was intermittently noted to be tachycardiac as
high as the 140s and hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s-80s; this
all improved as her respiratory status stabalized.
On ROS, the pt endorses pleuritic chest pain just above the
right breast where she fell earlier today. She also notes that
her LE may be slightly swollen as compared to baseline; she does
not believe she has had significant weight gain. No other chest
discomfort or palpitations. No fevers or chills. No abdominal
pain. No change in bowel or bladder function.

Imaging Studies:

CT angiogram chest ([**6-9**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Partial right lower lobe collapse secondary to obstruction of
the basal segments of the right lower lobe bronchi secondary to
secretions. Near complete obstruction of the left main stem
bronchus secondary to secretions with only minimal left lower
lobe atelectasis identified.
3. Ground-glass opacities within the right middle lobe, lingula
and left
lower lobe, which may represent the sequelae of aspiration.
Multiple borderline enlarged probable reactive mediastinal lymph
nodes.
4. Multiple bilateral calcified granuloma with several
noncalcified nodules measuring less than 3 mm as described
above, which could represent
noncalcified granulomas.
5. Stable emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
An 81 yo woman with history of [**Month/Year (2) 9215**], COPD and eosinophilic lung
disease who presents with acute onset of respiratory distress in
setting of several days of worsening dyspnea.

# Acute respiratory failure
The most likely etiology for her symptoms was pneumonia in the
setting of chronic obstructive lung disease. She also has a
history of poorly differentiated eosinophilic pneumonitis based
on mucosal biopsy from [**2138**].

CTA was negative for PE but did show a right lower lobe
infiltrate. She was started on vancomycin and levofloxacin for
pneumonia (gram + cocci in sputum) in addition to Flagyl for
history of C dif. Levo was later changed to ciprofloxacin when
pseudomonas was isolated in her sputum; similarly vancomycin was
switched to nafcillin when the GPC isolated was speciated as
MSSA. Albuterol, ipratropium, and steroids were given for COPD
exacerbation.

Her worsening respiratory acidosis required intubation on the
second hospital day. She remained intubated for approx three
days, at which time she was extubated to BiPAP without
complication. She was transferred to the floor with stable
oxygen saturations and respiratory status on oxygen by nasal
cannula ...

# Atrial fibrillation / supraventricular tachycardia
She was noted to have irregular rate tachycardia to 160s two
days after extubation. EKG was consistent with atrial
fibrillation. She was started on IV Lopressor and converted back
into sinus. This was switched back to her home metoprolol when
tolerating pos. Due to hypotension, metoprolol was stopped ...

# Pneumothorax
This was a complication of placing a left IJ as the patient
abruptly sat partway up during procedure. A pigtail catheter was
placed by interventional pulmonary service with good
decompression. This was placed to wall suction after extubation.
When CXR showed resolution of pneumothorax, the chest tube was
placed to water seal.

# History of C dificile
While she was treated with cipro and nafcillin as above, she was
also treated with IV Flagyl for history of C dif. The Flagyl
should be continued for two weeks after stopping cipro/nafcillin
(on [**6-19**]).

# Sepsis
She was started on levophed for dropping systolic blood
pressure. This was tapered quickly as her infection was treated.

# ECG changes
Most likely secondary to demand ischemia in setting of
respiratory distress. We continued her home aspirin and statin.

# History of congestive heart failure
As above, her home statin and aspirin were continued. Metoprolol
and Lasix held due to low blood pressure. These can be added
back when her blood pressure tolerates.

# Anemia
Her hematocrit was stable and
