Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20146**]
Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and extubation

History of Present Illness:
56 M w/ ESLD [**2-22**] HCV and EtOH cirrhosis, w/ locally advanced
unresectable end-stage HCC s/p TACE, trial of sorafenib &C1
xeolda, palliative chemo w/ capecitabine and cyberknife therapy,
who presents from home after being found altered by his wife.
Reportedly, pt was in his USOH until this morning when he fell
forward out of a chair, striking his forehead. He then went to
bed at 8am and when his wife went to arouse him, she found him
unresponsive so called EMS. EMS found him to have normal SaO2
and FSBS. His wife who is his HCP states she has had similar
episodes in the past but she is unable to say what those events
were and how they were treated. She gives him his medications at
home and denied possibility of overdose although pt is on
massive doses of narcotics at home and has been admitted for
narcotics overdose in the past, most recently from [**Date range (1) 72225**].

.
In the ED, VS initially 93 89/57 20 100% NRB. He appeared
unresponsive to noxious stimuli and had no gag, so was intubated
for airway protection via rapid-sequence without medications.
Initially he tolerated intubation without any medication but was
moving extremities while in CT scanner so was given etomidate
and succinylcholine. Initial ABG on 550x16 PEEP 5 FiO2 100% was
7.49/ 43/ 164.
.
In the ICU, he was intubated, sedated and not following
commands.

IMAGING:
[**2158-3-23**] CT Torso w/ con:
1. Status post left lateral hepatic segmentectomy and cyberknife
for the gastrohepatic lymphnode, with stable appearance of the
resection margin. Previosuly mentioned four lesions in the liver
have slightly increased in size and are concerning for foci of
HCC. Stable appearing caudate lobe lesion worrisome for another
HCC focus.
2. Gastrohepatic lymph node, slightly smaller since the prior
study.
3. Interval appearance of new ground glass opacities in the
lungs likely
representing inflammatory process.
.
[**2158-3-24**] CT Head w/o con: No acute intracranial process.
.
[**2158-3-24**] CT C-Spine w/o con:
1. No evidence of an acute fracture.
2. Stable appearance of multilevel degenerative joint changes,
most
pronounced at C5-C6 with posterior osteophyte disc complex
formation mildly impinging upon the thecal sac without evidence
of critical central canal stenosis. In the setting of high
clinical suspicion for ligamentous or central cord injury, may
consider MR.
3. Large amount of fluid pooling in the pharynx and hypopharynx,
which may put the patient at risk for aspiration.

CXR [**3-25**]:  Extensive bilateral consolidation in the lower lungs,
right greater than left, most likely pneumonia. Upper lungs are
clear. Pleural effusions are small if any. Heart size normal. ET
tube in standard placement. Nasogastric tube passes into the
stomach and out of view. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5850**] was paged.

Liver u/s [**3-25**]: 1. No significant ascites.
2. Multiple liver lesions are better appreciated on [**2158-3-23**] CT
scan.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 M w/ HCV and EtOH cirrhosis w/ locally advanced unresectable
HCC found down and unresponsive.
.
#Altered Mental Status: Etiology of unresponsiveness was unclear
at time of admission. Initial CT head was negative for acute
process or for metastatic lesions.  On admission, ddx included
meniningoencephalitis vs. hepatic encephalopathy vs
anticholinergic delirium vs. narcotic overdose vs. sepsis, with
ddx for possible LOC prior to admission including orthostatic
syncope (especially given sepsis physiology and poor PO intake
prior to admission). Given fever to 103.8 on admission to MICU,
sepsis was considered most seriously, and coverage was begun for
SBP (h/o cirrhosis) and meningitis (fever and AMS) with
vanco/ceftriaxone/ampicillin/acyclovir. Lactulose was also
started given concern for possible hepatic encephalopathy. CXR
ultimately showed development of PNA, and sputum culture was
positive for S. pneumoniae and H. influenza; thus, all abx but
CTX were discontinued on [**3-26**]. Sedation weaned as tolerated, and
patient was extubated [**2158-3-26**]. He was AAOx3 following extubation
and at baseline per outpatient providers and girlfriend.
.
#Community Acquired PNA: While initial CXR on [**3-24**] not concerning
for acute process, subsequent CXR on [**3-25**] showed development of
extensive bilateral consolidation in the lower lungs (R>L), most
likely pneumonia in the setting of fevers and hypotension.
Sputum culture from [**2158-3-24**] was positive for S. pneumoniae and H.
