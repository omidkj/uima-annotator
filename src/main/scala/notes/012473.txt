Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-4-29**] 7:07 AM

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval removl of pericardial drain with stable appearance
of the mediastinal and cardiac contours.
2. Persistent bilateral pleural effusions.

ECHO Study Date of [**2115-4-28**]

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume
overload. There are three aortic valve leaflets. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

 ECHO Study Date of [**2115-4-25**]
Conclusions:
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears
circumferential. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse;
although
there is no frank diastolic collapse of the right ventricle,
this chamber
appears compressed. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

 C.CATH Study Date of [**2115-4-25**]

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography was performed which revealed a
right
dominant system. There was no angiographically apparent CAD in
the LMCA,
LAD, LCX, or RCA.
2. Hemodynamics on entry showed markedly elevated right and left
heart
filling pressures (RVEDP 21 mm Hg, PCWP mean 30 mm Hg),
depressed
cardiac index (1.6), and mild pulmonary hypertension (PASP 47 mm
Hg).
3. Endomyocardial biospy was performed with removal of 5
specimens. The
procedure was tolerated well.
4. After the completion of the RV biopsy, right heart cath, and
coronary
angiograms, the 5 F right FA sheath was pulled in the cath lab.
The
patient became hypotensive to SBP in the 70s by noninvasive
measurement
with a HR of 105. Her pressure did not respond to atropine. An
emergent
echo was done, which showed a large pericardial effusion with
signs
worrisome for tamponade. The patient was reprepped for an
emergent
pericardiocentesis. The patient was mentating throughout.
5. Pericardiocentesis was performed via the subxyphoid approach
with
removal of approximately 700 cc of bloody fluid. RA pressure
fell from
fell from 31 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg and SBP increased from 80 to 120
mm Hg
after the pericardiocentesis was performed.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed.
3. Post procedure, patient developed severe pericardial
tamponade.
4. Mild pulmonary hypertension, elevated filling pressures, low
cardiac
output.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-4-10**] 9:16 AM

IMPRESSION:

1) Unchanged appearance of 9-mm noncalcified nodule in the right
lower lobe, please follow in 3 months.

2) Increase of bilateral pleural effusion and pericardial
effusion, associated with atelectasis.

3) Focal area of consolidative opacity in the posterior segment
of right upper lobe, which probably is representing atelectasis,
however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.

4) Cardiomegaly.

5) Decreased ascites and splenomegaly in this patient status
post liver transplant.

6) Extensive diffuse subcutaneous edema.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2115-3-13**] 10:16 AM

FINDINGS:

Targeted grayscale examination of the abdomen reveals a moderate
volume of ascites, increased since the prior study. A dedicated
assessment of the liver was not performed.

IMPRESSION:

Moderate volume of ascites.
