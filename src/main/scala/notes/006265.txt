Brief Hospital Course:
History of diastolic dysfxn, presenting with worsening failure,
with no diuresis response to 80 IV lasix in ED. Volume overload
state most likely due to worsening renal dysfunction as well as
hypermetabolic state from foot ulcer/cellulitis. Placed on lasix
and nitro drips overnight in ICU, with very little diuresis and
laboraory evidence of worsening renal dysfunction. He was
maintained on BiPap. Renal and podiatry services were initially
consulted, but eventually were deferred due to change in goals
of care as below. Mr. [**Known lastname 95923**]' wishes to not undergo dialysis or
be endotracheally intubated were confirmed by him. After
discussions with Mr. [**Known lastname 95923**], his family, pastor, and primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] were in agreement to change the goals of
care to focus on comfort.
He was placed on a morphine drip to alleviate his dyspnea and,
once the remainder of his family arrived, the BiPap was
discontinued. He died on [**1-22**] with family at the bedside. There
was no post-mortem examination.
