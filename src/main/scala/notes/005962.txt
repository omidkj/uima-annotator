Admission Date:  [**2120-5-3**]              Discharge Date:   [**2120-5-9**]


Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Lasix / Motrin

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
aphasia, R. hemiparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV TPA infusion

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86 year old right handed Albanian speaking
woman with a history of CHF, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not
on Coumadin, and kidney cyst s/p removal who presents with acute
onset aphasia and right sided weakness for whom neurology was
called for a CODE STROKE. The history is taken initially from
the patient's daughter-in-law, [**Name (NI) **].

At 3:30 pm today, the patient went to take a nap, but prior to
that was [**Location (un) 1131**] the newspaper and crocheting without
difficulty.  She woke up from the nap at 4:00-4:10 pm, as her
daughter was calling her on the phone. She grabbed the phone
with her left hand, but was unable to speak at all. Her
daughter-in-law also noted that she had increased work of
breathing, and her face was white/yellow. She did not notice any
unilateral weakness or facial asymmetry, but the patient could
not walked. EMS was called, and FSBG in the field was 180. She
was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

At [**Hospital1 18**], a CODE STROKE was called at 17:19, and neurology was
at the bedside at 17:22. She was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR. NIHSS 14. Head CT showed a hyperdense
left MCA and early loss of the left insular ribbon. IV tPA was
given at 18:21, at which time her bp was 136/96.

Of note, at 7:00 pm (when the rest of the patient's family
arrived), they mention that the patient had similar symptoms 5
years ago, but the symptoms were not as intense. (It should be
noted that on initial history, her daughter-in-law did not say
that she had ever had symptoms like this before). She had
aphasia x30-45 minutes and generalized weakness (not unilateral)
for which she was evaluated at [**Hospital1 2177**] with CT head and MRI head.
Per her family, she was given antibiotics for a lung infection
at that time. She was started on Coumadin at that time, and took
it for 2 months but then refused further doses. At 7:00 pm, her
sister also reported that the patient may have been complaining
of right
leg weakness vs. pain since 1:00 pm today; however, other family
members think she was complaining of generalized weakness.

Otherwise, she has complained of generalized weakness x1 week,
pain in her right leg x1 week, and has been having trouble
breathing. She has not had fevers/chills or cough/colds.

Past Medical History:
CHF
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin
Kidney cyst s/p removal
s/p cholecystectomy 2-3 years ago
Diverticulitis

She has no history of stroke, seizure, CAD, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia. She reportedly had elevated blood glucose a few
years ago for which she was treated with medications, but they
were since discontinued after she developed hypoglycemia.

She gets most of her care at [**Hospital1 112**] and [**Location (un) 20026**] Hospital.

Social History:
The patient is originally from [**Country 38213**], and came to the US 10
years ago. She is a former director of a high school in [**Country 38213**].
She is independent at baseline. She lives at home with her son,
daughter-in-law [**Doctor First Name **], and their children.  Her HCP is her
daughter [**Name (NI) 15139**]. She denies cigarette, EtOH, or illicit drug use.



Family History:
Her brother died of a stroke in his 70s.

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, follows commands to squeeze left

Cranial Nerves: Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to
3 mm bilaterally. No gaze preference. Does not reliably blink to
threat bilaterally or follow commands for EOM. Initial had minor
flattening of the right NLF (but would not follow command to
smile), 30 minutes later had a right UMN facial droop. Tongue
midline.

Motor: Normal tone bilaterally in UE and LE. No observed
myoclonus or tremor. Keeps left arm briefly off the bed, and
keeps left leg off the bed x5 seconds. Keeps right forearm
lifted against gravity, but does not lift the deltoid. Only has
a flicker of contraction of the right leg, but does withdraw the
right leg to nailbed pressure.

IMAGING:
CT Head (our read): Possible hyperdense left MCA, early loss of
the left insular ribbon

CXR (PRELIM): prominent right paratracheal opacity could be due
to enlarged thyroid, although other mediastinal mass is not
excluded. recommend comparison with any prior studies if
available, o/w nonemergent u/s or chest CT. bilat pleural eff
with overlying atelect/consol.

Brief Hospital Course:
Attending A/P: Acute L-MCA infarction, likely cardioembolic in
setting of AF, s/p iv tPA. Repeat exam shows minimal
improvement. Repeat head CT shows a large evolving left
hemispheric infarction but no significant bleeding. Continue ICU
monitoring for now. Will hold off on CTA because of renal
failure. Check carotid dopplers. Hold
off on antipaletelst, anticoagulants for now. D/C iv pressors.
Monitor I/O closely. Swallow eval. Family counseled about
patient's condition at bedside; questions answered.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 86555**] had no improvement following tPA.  She continued with
full aphasia, as judged by her family members (speaks only
Albanian).  Her attention and interaction improved somewhat over
the first four days of her hospitalization, but she never
displayed clear attempt to communicate or evidence of
understanding.

On [**2120-5-8**], a family meeting was held, with the patient's two
daughters ([**Name (NI) 15139**], the HCP, was present), the attending physician
(Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and the resident physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
attenance.  The daughters stated that Mrs. [**Known lastname 86555**] had explicitly
stated on multiple occasions that she would not want to survive
by artificial support.  She stated that she would not want
further surgeries and would not want to be intubated.  We weaned
her to comfort measures only, withdrawing medications and tube
feeds.  She expired the following evening.
