History of Present Illness:
CC:  Shortness of breath and sore throat.

HPI:

Ms. [**Known lastname 6759**] is a 68 yo woman, with hx of lung cancer, throat
cancer, COPD, Afib, here with sore throat and shortness of
breath.

She was admitted in [**2-1**] with atrial fibrillation and pneumonia.

She thinks she improved from this.

In the past 3 days, she has not been sleeping as she has been
waking from sleep with feeling of being smothered.  She has felt
this way before.   She has not noticed any dyspnea on exertion.
She noticed small amount of lower extremity edema, new for her.
She has a dry cough, no fevers.  She has had a sore throat,
which
feels dry.  She has not had any chest pain or palpitations.  She
has gained 6lbs in the past few months intentionally.  She has
been eating normally, and has not been on any fluid restriction
at home.  She feels thirsty.  She also feels a bit off,
personality-wise.

She went to see her PCP and was sent to the ED for evaluation.

In the ED, she had possible thrush on exam.  Vital signs were
stable.  She received a nebulizer and was transported to 7
[**Hospital Ward Name 1950**].

Here she complains of shortness of breath and sore throat.

ROS notable for intentional weight gain as above, chronic
psoriatic rash, no abdominal symptoms, no other neurologic
symptoms, ROS otherwise in 13 other systems and negative.

[**2178-4-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable post-surgical and post-radiation changes of the right
lung.
2. Interval improvement of previously seen right lower lobe
opacification.
3. No new opacity, effusion, or pneumothorax.

CTCHEST:[**2178-4-7**]

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Worsening opacities in the right lower lobe which had cleared
in early
[**Month (only) 956**]. New occlusions from secretions of the right middle
lobe and distal bronchi consistent with a picture of chronic
aspiration. Alternatively if the patient received chemotherapy
between [**Month (only) 404**] and [**Month (only) 956**] this could be a picture of
improving malignancy, but more likely it is infection caused by
chronic aspiration.
3. Right middle lobe collpase and concurrent infectious process
is improving.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**2178-4-9**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferolateral
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. At least mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2176-9-2**],
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are both more prominent.
Pulmonary hypertension is now seen.
