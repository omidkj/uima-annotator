Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Xanax / Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia, feeling unwell

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] M with pacemaker admitted for rapid afib. In [**2102**], he had a
dual chamber St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] pacemaker placed for symptomatic
bradycardia and chronitropic incompetence and has been doing
fairly well. He walks his dog 1.5 miles daily. This morning, he
woke up feeling lousy and tried to walk the dog but could only
make it down the block and had to turn back. Did not have enough
energy and felt some lightheadedness. No chest pain or shortness
of breath. He called [**Hospital **] clinic who interogatted the pacer over
the phone and found him tachycardic. He was told to go to the
ED.

Otherwise he feels well. On review of systems, denies fevers,
chills, nausea, vomit, abd pain, diarrhea. On cardiac review of
systems, denies orthopnea, PND or increase in peripheral edema.


In the ED, vitals were: 98.6, 128, 144/85, 24, 100%RA. Because
of his fast heart rates, he was given dilt 10 IV x 3 and dilt 30
mg PO followed by 60 mg PO.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2104-2-28**]): Left-sided pacer is again seen with leads
overlying the right atrium and ventricle. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours appear stable. Pulmonary vascularity
appears within normal limits. There is persistent eventration of
the right hemidiaphragm and mild hyperexpansion, not
significantly changed in appearance from prior. There are no
focal consolidations or large pleural effusions.

CT Head ([**2104-2-29**]):
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. The ventricles, cisterns,
and sulci are enlarged secondary to involutional change,
unchanged from [**2097**]. Periventricular white matter hypodensities
are the sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter differentiation, however, is preserved. The osseous
structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear.

CXR ([**2104-2-29**]): A new interstitial edema has developed in both
lungs more predominantly at the bases. The heart is enlarged.
Small subtle left pleural effusion might be present. A
left-sided pacer is again noted with leads overlying the right
atrium and right ventricle. Persistent eventration the right
hemidiaphragm.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-2**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2102-9-25**], there is now moderate concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy with a small cavity, reduced ejection
fraction, and evidence of severe diastolic dysfunction. The
cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation.

Renal US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Cortical atrophy of the right kidney and absence of diastolic
flow in the segmental arteries indicative of an intrinsic
vascular abnormality. The limited Doppler study on the right
does not allow for evaluation of renal artery stenosis.
2. Multiple simple bilateral renal cysts, unchanged from [**3-7**], [**2102**].

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] pacemaker placed for
symptomatic bradycardia in [**2102**] who presented with new onset
afib with RVR.  The patient was initially anticoagulated with
heparin for new onset atrial fibrillation with RVR with
initiation of coumadin.  Two of his home antihypertensives were
held (Amlodipine and Losartan) to leave room to uptitrate
beta-blockade for improved rate control.  He was seen by EP who
decided to attempt chemical cardioversion which was successful.
On the day of cardioversion the patient became acutely
hypertensive to 270 systolic.  He also had difficulty breathing
in this setting.  He was treated with 30 of IV hydralazine, 25
mg of IV Lopressor, 25 mg po captopril and 20 IV lasix.  His
blood pressure was fairly refractory to these interventions and
the patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit
for closer monitoring.  He also received 2 mg IV Ativan for
agitation.  Upon arrival in the unit, the patient became
somewhat unresponsive with minimally reactive pupils.  Given his
hypertensive emergency, there was suspicion for stroke.  The
patient had a negative head CT scan.  He was unable to have MRI
given his pacer.  His mental status improved to baseline
overnight.  According to his wife, he has had similar episodes
in the past with benzodiazapines and it was thought his mental
status change was most likely secondary to a medication effect.


The patient returned to the floor with difficult to control
blood pressure.  He was treated aggressively with
anti-hypertensives.  The patient experienced dizziness with both
blood pressure highs and when his blood pressure was too low.
Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient generally has a blood pressure between
140-160.  Per his wife, the patient has had transient elevations
in his blood pressure over 200 in the past.  From prior notes,
it appears the patient has some element of autonomic dysfunction
in addition to known left renal artery stenosis s/p stent and
critical aortic stenosis.  As he became relatively hypotensive
(sbp of 90) on labetolol as well as hydralazine, both of these
agents were discontinued.  The patient experienced acute on
chronic renal failure, most likely secondary to kidney
hypoperfusion while hypotensive
