PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial examination revealed a
temperature of 103.4; heart rate of 116; blood pressure of
130/28; respiratory rate of 30 and oxygen saturation of 91%
on room air.  The patient was an ill-appearing female, in no
acute distress; minimally responsive to painful stimuli.  She
had diffuse coarse breath sounds with a 2 out of 6 systolic
murmur.  She had normal bowel sounds without rebound or
guarding.  She had a sacral decubitus ulcer.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC was significant for white blood cell
count of 19.6 with 70 neutrophils, 25 bands, 3 lymphocytes;
hematocrit of 31.  Chemistry 7 was significant for BUN of 50
and creatinine of 1.4.  Lactate was 5.9.  Cardiac enzymes
were sent and were sent for a troponin of 0.17.  Urinalysis
was significant for positive nitrites, moderate leukocyte
esterase.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
minute with a left axis deviation; old Q wave in V1 and V2
with T wave inversions in 3, AVF and V1 through V3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since the patient had fever, tachycardia,
increased white blood cell count with pronounced left shift
and increased lactate, tachypnea and hypoxia, the patient was
felt to be experiencing sepsis.  Sepsis protocol was
activated.  The right internal jugular was placed and the
patient received intravenous hydration, empiric antibiotic
coverage (Levofloxacin, Gentamycin, Vancomycin) and was
intubated for airway protection. The patient was then
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for intensive
monitoring.

The rest of the hospital course is described by systems:

1.) Pulmonary:  The patient was initially intubated for
airway protection.  Chest x-ray revealed no focal
consolidation or pleural effusion.  The patient was extubated
on hospital day number two without complications.  The
patient's pulmonary status remained stable for the rest of
the admission.

2.) Cardiac:  As stated previously, initial cardiac enzymes
were significant for a troponin of 0.17.  Electrocardiogram
was significant for some new T wave inversions.  These
changes were felt to be in the setting of demand ischemia.
The patient had an echocardiogram done during the admission
which revealed moderate mitral regurgitation and a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 35%.

3.) Infectious disease:  The patient's blood cultures were
positive for Proteus, making a urine source of infection most
likely. The patient was initially started on Zosyn to cover
Proteus bacteremia as well as possible anaerobes in the
sacral decubitus ulcer.  The patient was continued on Zosyn
and became afebrile on hospital day number seven.  At this
time, the sacral decubitus ulcer culture was found to be
positive for Proteus as well and plastic surgery felt that
coverage for anaerobes was no longer necessary.  As a result,
the patient was switched to Ceftriaxone.

On hospital day number nine, Vancomycin was added when it was
found that blood cultures drawn on hospital day number 5 grew
out coagulase negative Staphylococcus, resistant to Oxacillin
in two out of four bottles, including one drawn through the
PICC line and one drawn through a peripheral site.  At this
time,l the patient was still afebrile. Cultures drawn through
the porta-cath and culture of the discontinued PICC line
catheter tip were negative.  The patient was continued on
both Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin through discharge.

MENTAL STATUS CHANGES:  Initially, the patient was minimally
responsive to even painful stimuli.  The patient had a CT
scan that was significant for mild hypodensity in the
periventricular white matter bilaterally that was consistent
with chronic microvascular infarction.  The ventricles and
sulci were also prominent, consistent with moderate brain
atrophy.  There was no evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect.  Neurology was consulted who felt
that her change in mental status reflected underlying
dementia, exacerbated by a toxic metabolic encephalopathy,
most likely of infectious origin. They recommended treating
her multiple infections, attempting to limit her sedating
medications, discontinuing the Fentanyl patch, having a well
lit room and using a low dose Haldol as needed for extreme
agitation.  Sedating medications were limited and the
infection was treated.  The patient continued to improve over
the course of her admission.  The the patient went from
minimal responsiveness to being able to answer yes and no
questions to eventually being able to hold a minimal
conversation with use of complete sentences.  At the time of
her discharge, she was oriented to person and place but not
time.  There was consideration of having magnetic resonance
scan performed to further evaluate central nervous system
pathology.  However, the patient was taken down to the
magnetic resonance scan suite and began screaming, which was
felt to preclude the ability to obtain adequate magnetic
resonance scan images.  The family was consulted and treating
team explained to the family that magnetic resonance scan was
unlikely to provide information that could provide
therapeutic benefit but was rather for diagnostic interest.
As a result, the family agreed to forego magnetic resonance
scan.

Ulcers:  Plastics was consulted for evaluation of the sacral
decubitus ulcer.  They debrided the ulcer and treated with a
Dakin's treatment as well as wet to dry dressing changes
three times a day.  At the time of discharge, they felt that
dressing changes could be changed to normal saline wet to dry
dressing changes three times a day along with discontinuation
of the Dakin's.  They encouraged optimization of nutrition as
well as keeping the patient rotated to decrease pressure in
the sacral area. Podiatry was also consulted for evaluation
of foot ulcers.  They recommended bilateral multi-poultice
splints to prevent further heel break-down. They recommended
non invasive arterial studies when the patient is medically
stable.  They recommended considering a vascular surgery
consult as a result of non invasive arterial studies which
were poor. They did not recommend operative intervention
during the current admission.

Endocrine:  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient was managed on
NPH as well as regular insulin sliding scale. At the time of
discharge, the patient's insulin were 30 units of NPH at
breakfast as well as 16 units of NPH at dinner.

Thyroid:  The patient was continued on Synthroid during her
admission.
