Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stent placement

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 75yo F with h/o DM, 70packyr history of smoking, COPD on
home O2, presented to an OSH with symptoms of malaise, dyspnea
and CP (substernal pressure radiating to both shoulders,
+diaphoresis, B arm radiation). Pt ignored symptoms x few days
and presented to OSH with an acute coronary syndrome by enzymes
and ECG.  She was started on heparin gtt, Lovenox, nitro gtt,
Lopressor for ACS.  CP increased, ECG showed worsening lateral
ST depression and STE in V1 and aVR.  CK neg., Trop I 2.2.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent catheterization.
During cath was found to have 3VD.  Cardiac Surgery team was
involved and decided against CABG due to poor renal status and
O2 dependent COPD.  Pt underwent high risk intervention:
rotational atherectomy of LMCA and LCx (80% distal LMCA into LCx
origin), s/p kissing Cypher stents to LMCA into LAD and LCx.  No
intra aortic balloon pump placed due to occluded right common
iliac artery.

COPD (2L NC at home)

Social History:

CT w/o contrast [**2114-5-24**]:
                          FINAL REPORT
 "1)  12-mm lobulated nodule within the right lower lobe.  The
features are
 concerning for possible neoplasm.  This could be further
evaluated with chest
 CT, or alternatively, with follow-up chest CT in six weeks
following treatment
 of the patient's acute symptoms.
 2)  Severe emphysema.
 3)  Ground-glass and confluent nodular opacities with
bronchiectasis within
 the right lung, findings that are suggestive of right-sided
pneumonia vs
 aspiration, although tuberculosis must be excluded. 4)  Hiatal
hernia.
 5)  Cholelithiasis.
 6)  Hypodense lesions within the right and left kidneys, too
small to
 accurately characterize on the right and consistent with cysts
on the left.
 7)  Compression fracture of an upper lumbar vertebra."

CT with contrast [**2114-5-26**]:
 1. No pulmonary artery aneurysm or embolism identified.
 2. Mild increased interstitial and aveolar opacity in the
posterior right
 lower lobe, consistent with probable right lung aspiration
and/or pneumonia as
 previously suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)CAD: s/p revascularization of LMCA/LAD/LCx. Pt tolerated this
high risk PCI well.  Has chronically occluded RCA filling via L
to R collaterals. Not felt to be a surgical candidate due to
comorbid conditions. Started on ASA, BB, high dose Lipitor,
Plavix.  Started on Integrilin but was d/c'd early due to a
stable femoral hematoma.  Post-cath, she experienced
intermittent CP with hypoxia, and had associated ST depressions
in V4-V6.  The episode was thought to be more likely secondary
to demand ischemia from respiratory decompensation rather than
stent thrombosis as patient did not have ST elevations.  Enzymes
trended to peak: CK-MB 7.8, TropT 0.68.  On Lipitor 80. Also
started on ACE-i on 3rd day of hospital stay.

2)Pump: Markedly elevated L and R sided filling pressures,
depressed CO on cath.  Echo showed EF of 30-40% with inf/post
hypokinesis, 1+MR, and moderate pulm HTN.  Gently diuresed, with
improvement of pulmonary edema on CXR.  Hemodynamically stable.
Continuing very gentle diuresis.

3)Hypoxia: Out of proportion to degree of pulm edema, likely
pneumonia and COPD exacerbation.  Intubated on night of
admission after desatting to 80% on NRB, w/ ABG of 7.4/48/48 and
exam showing poor air movement.  CXR showed b/l basilar and RML
infiltrates and pleural effusions.  She was started on
antibiotics for pneumonia. She was also given nebs, MDIs, and
stress dose steroids for COPD exacerbation.  Subsequent CXRs
showed improvement of pulmonary edema/pneumonia.  Pt
self-extubated on night of [**5-19**] and had an ABG of 7.42/55/98.
She was monitored on 70% FM and maintained good O2 sats.  Put on
10L FM with 4L NC, often removed FM and still maintained good O2
sats.  Plan to taper steroids, continue nebs and MDIs, wean O2
as tolerated.  Discharged on 3L N.C. and 5mg prednisone.  (See
