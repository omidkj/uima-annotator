Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of COPD, CHF with
LVEF 45% (from [**2101**]), CAD s/p CABG and past PCI, and AFib on
Coumadin who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for shortness of
breath and urinary retention from [**2106-2-12**] to [**2106-2-16**].

During the above admission, his SOB was attributed to a COPD
exacerbation in the setting of a recent viral URI.  He was
started on Prednisone 60 mg daily, Advair, and nebulizer
treatments, with rapid improvement in his respiratory status. A
chest X-ray performed during that admission did not show
evidence of pneumonia. He was also started on Augmentin for
treatment of a pan-sensitive enterococcal UTI that was noted on
UA and urine cultures.  He was discharged on a Prednisone taper
(over 10 days) and Augmentin to complete a 10 day course.  His
Coumadin was held on discharge for a supra-therapeutic INR with
plans to restart it opnce his INR dropped below 3.0. He was
discharged to rehab at [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 583**].

One day after discharge, his family was notified that he was
having increased work of breathing and shortness of breath while
at rehab.  He was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED, his initial vital signs were as follows: BP 121/88,
HR 94, RR 18, and SpO2 99% on 6L (SpO2 85% on room air). He was
placed on BiPAP and given nebulizer treatments with some
improvement in his work of breathing. His CXR showed new
opacities in the RUL field and LLL. He was given Vancomycin 1
gram IV, Cefepime 2 grams IV, and Levofloxacin 750 mg IV.  He
was also given Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV, Ativan 0.5 mg IV,
and Magnesium sulfate 2 grams IV. EKG showed AFib at 108 bpm
with baseline artifact and lateral TWI. Labs were notable for a
newly elevated WBC count 15.1 (7.1 the day before) with 5%
bands. His Cr had also increased to 2.6 from 2.4, which was
thought to be his baseline. His Troponin T was elevated to 0.13,
higher than recent values at his last admission with normal
CKMB. His INR was 3.1, consistent with his recent trend with
Coumadin held. He was admitted to the ICU for further management
of pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation.

Once in the ICU, he continued to have increased work of
breathing and significant wheezing. He improved on
broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
cefepime) and treatment for COPD. His course was complicated by
delirium and he failed a bedside speech and swallow evaluation
on [**2-19**].

Radiographic Studies:
[**2106-2-17**] Portable Chest X-Ray: IMPRESSION: In comparison to
[**2106-2-13**] exam, there is development new of right upper zone
patchy opacities and left lower lobe opacity concerning for
multifocal pneumonia.
.
[**2106-2-26**]: Frontal chest radiograph is compared to multiple prior
examinations. The heart is markedly enlarged. Status post CABG.
There is patchy density in the right mid upper lung zone. There
is also retrocardiac opacity, small left pleural effusion.
Findings have not changed appreciably since [**2106-2-19**].
.
[**2106-2-22**] MRA/MRI head IMPRESSION: Severe atheromatous disease
with no evidence of acute infarction
.
Echo [**2-25**]: The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferolateral
dyskinesis, mid inferolateral akinesis, basal
inferior/inferoseptal akinesis, mid inferior hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. The pulmonic valve leaflets
are thickened. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2102-7-27**], left ventricular systolic function is
now more depressed. Mitral regurgitation and aortic
regurgitation are now more prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the MICU due to respiratory distress from
Health-care associated pneumonia which was managed with BIPAP
and did not require intubation. He was treated with Vancomycin,
Cefepime, Levofloxacin for an 8 day course with improvement in
O2 requirement, cough, and leukocytosis. He was noted to be
aspirating and was seen by s/s who felt that it would be safest
for him to continue with nectar thickened liquids. His hospital
course was complicated by acute renal failure and hypernatremia.
Diuretics were initially held and free water deficit corrected.
However, he developed volume overload and acute systolic heart
failure and worsening SOB with BNP > 7000. Echocardiogram
revealed depressed LVEF 40% (new) with worsening valve disease
and regional abnormalities. He w
