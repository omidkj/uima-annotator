Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3227**]
Chief Complaint:
Skull Defect - s/p craniectomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cranioplasty
placement of external ventricular drain


History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old male who presents to clinic today for
admission for an elective cranioplasty tomorrow.
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 67736**] has a history of a recurrent
hemangiopericytoma s/p resection that was complicated by a bone
flap infection and tumor recurrence. The tumor recurrence was
successfully treated with Cyberknife radiosurgery [**2197-6-19**]. With
regards to the bone flap infection, the patient was ultimately
cleared by ID for crainplasty. He underwent placement of scalp
expanders by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. in preparation for placement of
the
cranioplasty. The patient now presents for discussion of
definitive cranioplasty.

Overall - the patient is doing well. He He remains at his
baseline neurological functioning, and has no new symptoms or
concerns to address.  He denies any recent fevers, vision
changes, new headaches, motor or sensory changes.


Past Medical History:
(1) a left hemicraniectomy on [**2196-6-24**] to [**2196-6-25**] for removal
of
a hemangiopericytoma at [**Hospital6 1129**],
(2) a craniplasty with placement of a synthetic bone graft on
[**2196-9-27**],
(3) a wound revision on [**2196-12-10**] to remove MRSA-infected
cranioplasty,
(4) s/p Cyberknife radiosurgery radiosurgery to the tumor from
[**2197-6-19**] to [**2197-6-23**] to 3000 cGy (600 cGy x 5 fractions) at 83%
isodose line.
(5) placement of scalp expander

Social History:
He previously was a driver for UPS.  He smoked cigarettes for 15
years but stopped since [**2196-6-19**] when his hemangiopericytoma
was diagnosed


Family History:

sisters but he does not know their health status.  He has 2
identical twin daughters and they are healthy.

IMAGING:

[**9-21**] CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. Status post cranioplasty of the left frontoparietal region
with
postoperative changes of air and fluid level in the region. New
hemorrhagic  foci in the brain with one in the right caudate
region extending to the lateral ventricles.
2. Subarachnoid blood in the posterior fossa and cerebellar
hemorrhage
together produce obliteration of the fourth ventricle and
quadrigeminal
cistern indicating posterior fossa edema.
3. Mild new dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] indicate
developing
hydrocephalus.
4. The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time
of
interpretation of the study on [**2198-9-21**] at 3 p.m.

[**9-22**] CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. Little overall change in multiple foci of intracranial
hemorrhage
including extensive parenchymal, intraventricular and
subarachnoid hemorrhage, and posterior fossa edema.
2. Unchanged mass effect on the fourth ventricle and
quadrigeminal cistern
and asymmetric enlargement of the left lateral ventricle
relative to the
right, suggestive of developing but stable hydrocephalus.

[**9-22**] CT Torso: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intrathoracic,
abdominal or pelvic mass.

[**9-22**] MRI head: IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative changes with cranioplasty as seen on the recent
CT
examination. A ventricular drain is identified.
2. Multiple areas of hemorrhage in the supra- and infratentorial
region with extension into the ventricle. Most of these areas
demonstrate no definite nodular enhancement except for subtle
enhancement in the right basal ganglia and left cerebellar
region. The finding is not typical for metastatic disease, but
it is unclear if due to hemorrhage, the enhancement is not well
visualized. Continued further followup can help. No acute
infarct is seen.

[**9-26**] CT head: IMPRESSION:
1. Overall, minimal change from the most recent comparison study
with
redemonstration of multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage as well as
intraventricular and extra-axial hemorrhage.
2. While the overall volume of blood appears similar to that
seen previously, as does the size and configuration of the
ventricles, with marked asymmetric dilatation of the left
lateral ventricle, perhaps reflecting hydrocephalus superimposed
on ex vacuo effect.
3. Gas and fluid-containing subgaleal collection, also appears
minimally
changed over the interval.

[**9-30**] CTH
1. Interval evolution and redistribution of blood products. No
evidence of
new hemorrhage.
2. Stable appearance of the ventricles with asymmetric dilation
of the left
lateral ventricle.
3. Stable size of fluid-containing subgaleal collection with
decreased amount
of gas over the interval from [**2198-9-26**]

MRI Head [**10-9**]

Postoperative changes with cranioplasty in the left
frontoparietal lobe are
largely unchanged. There is stable appearance to the 7 mm of
midline shift
towards the left. Further evolution of the extra-axial
collections and right
basal ganglia and left temporo-parietal hemorrhage. No new sites
of
intracranial hemorrhage or slow diffusion are seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the NSurg service from clinic for a
thorough pre operative work up. He was seen and cleared by
anesthesia for general anesthesia.  He was placed on vancomycin
upon admission for surgical prophylaxis, and an ID consult was
obtained for specific guidelines for post operative
antimicrobial management.  He was taken to the operating room on
[**9-21**] for cranioplasty and repair of cranial defect. This case was
also performed with the help of the plastic surgery team.

[**9-21**]- Pt taken to OR for cranioplasty and repair of cranial
defect. Post operatively pt did not recover from anesthesia in a
timely manner. Pt was taken to CT from the OR and it showed
multiple metastatic lesions had hemorrhaged and there was
interventricular extension. An EVD was placed and was leveled at
the tragus. Pt remain intubated and sedated post operatively. He
was continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone was added for drain
prophylaxis. On post op exam he was not following commands but
localizing his LUE and withdrawing both lower extremities. He
had minimal movement in RUE which was consistent with his
pre-operative exam.

[**9-22**]- Pt was extubated without difficulty and his EVD remained at
the level of the tragus. He did have a subgaleal JP drain placed
by plastic surgery at the time of his procedure and this
draining 300cc of serosanguineous fluid. There was a question of
CSF in the JP drain as his EVD was noted to be putting out only
15cc for a 24 hour period. His JP drain was taken off suction
and his EVD output did increase. He had no episodes of increased
ICP and they ranged from 0-3. He did get OOB on this day. His
exam did improve and was following commands with his left side
and was
