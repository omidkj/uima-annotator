History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 47-year-old man with type 1 diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, ESRD on HD ([**1-11**] DM), p/w 3 days of N/V/D, but
denied melena, BRBPR, or hematemesis. Did have pink tinge to
emesis 1 day prior to admission. He also c/o fever x 2 days, dry
cough x 1 week. No sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] a left AV fisula and a
left HD tunnelled catheter. Admits to poor po intake, malaise,
but denies CP, SOB, palpitations. Mild abd pain.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 101, 112, 182/92, 24, 96%ra. Blood and
urine sent for culture, and pt given tylenol. He had mild abd
tenderness, so CT abd performed which was negative for acute
process. ECG was unchanged from prior. Was mildly tachypneic
which resolved after IVFs (appears to have received 1L). He had
a negative U/A and b/l pleural effusions on CXR, ? b/l
infiltrate vs atelectasis. Given Vanco/zosyn to cover broadly
and for pulm source. While in ED, he had 300cc of coffee ground
emesis, which cleared with NG lavage. GI was called and
recommended IV protonix which was given. He had serial Hct which
dropped from 31-->26. Two PIVs established. Admitted to MICU for
concern for sepsis and UGIB. VS prior to transfer: HR 90s,
180/87, 21, 99% ra.
.
In the MICU, hct dropped from 30 to 26 in the setting of IVF.
Received vanc/zosyn to cover broadly for fever of unknown
source. No further bleeding. He was called out to floor, and EGD
was complicated by vagal episode (bradycardia and hypotension)
and procedure was discontinued. He then had a second presyncopal
episode with elevated troponin with TWI noted on EKG and was
sent back to the ICU. TTE showed newly dpressed EF 30% with no
focal wall motion abnormality. Cards consulted and recommended
work-up for cardiomyopathy. Last HD yesterday in the setting of
hyperkalemia (K 6). Abx discontinued with no further fevers.
Viral screen pending.

[**2123-1-4**] - TTE: Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**2123-1-4**] - CXR - FINDINGS: Left subclavian double lumen central
venous dialysis catheter with tip overlying the proximal right
atrium. Moderate bilateral effusions noted. Increased
interstitial markings in the lower lungs bilaterally consistent
with mild interstitial edema. Heart is at the upper limits of
normal in size. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax within
the visualized portion of the lungs.
.
[**2123-1-4**] - CT abdomen/pelvis - IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater
than left.
2. No other CT findings to explain patient's abdominal pain.

Test                          Result              Reference
Range/Units
Hereditary Hemochromatosis, PCR, DNA Mutation
[**Numeric Identifier 57191**]                        NEGATIVE

INTERPRETATION: DNA TESTING INDICATES THAT THIS
INDIVIDUAL IS NEGATIVE FOR THE C282Y AND H63D MUTATIONS
IN THE HFE GENE.  THIS NEGATIVE RESULT SIGNIFICANTLY
REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS
(HH) IN THIS INDIVIDUAL.  HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT RULE OUT
THE PRESENCE OF OTHER MUTATIONS WITHIN THE HFE GENE OR
A DIAGNOSIS OF HH.  THE RISK OF THIS INDIVIDUAL
CARRYING A HFE MUTATION OTHER THAN THOSE TESTED IN THIS
ASSAY DEPENDS GREATLY ON FAMILY AND CLINICAL HISTORY AS
WELL AS ETHNICITY.  THIS ASSAY DOES NOT TEST FOR OTHER
PRIMARY OR SECONDARY IRON OVERLOAD DISORDERS.

INTERPRETATION                PAST INFECTION

THE SERODIAGNOSIS OF CHAGAS' DISEASE OR AMERICAN
TRYPANOSOMIASIS BY IFA IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND SPECIFIC,
ALTHOUGH CROSS-REACTIONS [**Month (only) **] OCCUR WITH LEISHMANIASIS.  AN
ANTI-T. CRUZI IGM (> OR = 1:20) RESPONSE IS OBSERVED IN
ACUTE DISEASE PRIOR TO AN IGG SEROCONVERSION. IN CHRONIC
CHAGAS' DISEASE IGG LEVELS ARE USUALLY DETECTED AT LEVELS
GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 1:64.

Brief Hospital Course:
47 y.o. man with DM2, ESRD on HD, dCHF, presents with N/V/D,
fever, and coffe ground emesis, new cardiomyopathy.
.
CARDIOMYOPATHY: Patient with progressive dyspnea over the past
year and interval decline in EF.  He had a history of exposure
to a Chagas endemic country and was found to be Chagas IgG
positive, IgM negative, concerning for Chagas cardiomyopathy.
However, the pattern of heart disease was somewhat inconsistant,
and he may have other causes for cardiomyopathy.  Of note, his
Ferritin was > [**2113**] and his Fe/TIBC ratio was 65%, suggestive of
hemachromatosis.  However, genotyping showed him to be negative
for the common mutations in this disorder.  Further differential
includes ischemic, ideopathic, infectious, or ESRD-associated.
No family history or history of toxin exposure.  ESR 46, [**Doctor First Name **]
1:40, TSH 3, HIV negative.  Patient was continued on maximum
dose [**Last Name (un) **] and his beta blocker was uptitrated slightly.
Torsemide was restarted.
- Would recommend initiation of antitrypanosomal treatment.
These results came back after discharge and were communicated to
patient's primary care physician.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Outpatient cardiology follow up scheduled
- Continue carful volume control at HD
- Would consider cardiac MRI and stress MIBI to differentiate
etiologies of cardiomyopathy.
.
UPPER GI BLEED: Coffee ground emesis most likely from upper GI
source. Most likely [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear vs. PUD. EGD was deferred
in the setting of hypotension. Patient refused transfusion in
ICU, and Hct improved without intervention.  Hematemesis
resolved.
- Continue on [**Hospital1 **] PPI for one month.
