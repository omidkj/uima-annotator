IMAGING:
CT CHEST:
Provisional Findings Impression: MLKb SUN [**2138-10-12**] 2:55 PM
NO PE.
Consolidation in lung bases, associated with pleural effusion
bilaterally.

Final Report
HISTORY: 67-year-old female with severe hypoxia, history of
COPD, pulmonary
edema. Rule out pulmonary embolism.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT of the chest was performed before and after
administration of
intravenous contrast. Images were reformatted in the axial,
coronal,
sagittal, and oblique planes.

FINDINGS:
There is no filling defect within the main, right, left, lobar,
or segmental
branches of the pulmonary artery to suggest the presence of
pulmonary
embolism. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis can be seen, more
extensive
compared to prior study obtained on [**2138-9-22**]. Within the
posterior aspect of
right upper and left upper lobes, there are patches of
consolidation
consistent with pneumonia. There is diffuse interstitial
thickening, likely
representing pulmonary edema. The amount of pleural effusion has
also
increased compared to prior study of [**2138-9-22**]. Again noted is
mediastinal and
hilar lymphadenopathy. Unchanged and stable calcified granuloma
within the
right upper lobe (series 3, image 51). Endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tube
are in place. Patient is status post CABG. There is thinning of
myocardium
associated with calcification at the apex of the heart, and
could be result of
prior myocardium infarction.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes in the spine are
present.
Previously-described subcutaneous emphysema has been resolved.

IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Atelectasis in lower lobes associated with pleural effusion
bilaterally.
Patchy opacities suspicious of pneumonia.

STRESS MIBI:

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
9.2 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Tetrofosmin Rest ([**2138-10-20**]);
30.2 mCi Tc-99m Tetrofosmin Stress ([**2138-10-20**]);
HISTORY: 67 year old woman with CAD and CHF, admitted for
recurrent episodes of
pulmonary edema, evaluate for perfusion defects.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
mg/kg/min.

IMAGING METHOD:
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m tetrofosmin.
Tracer was
injected approximately 30 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.
Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous
dipyridamole,
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m tetrofosmin
was
administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained
approximately 30 minutes
following tracer injection.
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

INTERPRETATION:
Left ventricular cavity size is moderately enlarged.
There are moderate fixed perfusion defect in the basal inferior
wall, the apex,
and the inferolateral wall.

Gated images reveal hypokinesis of the basal inferior, apex, and
inferolateral
wall.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 36%.

No previous study to compare.

IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate fixed perfusion defect in the basal
inferior wall , the
apex, and the inferolateral wall with associated hypokinesis. 2.
Moderately
enlarged left ventricule with calculated EF of 36%.

INTERPRETATION:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16471**] is a 67 year old woman with coronary artery disease
s/p CABG
in [**2125**] and PCI, COPD who presented with worsening dyspnea. The
patient
was infused with 0.142mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 mintues.
The
patient reported a headache during the infusion. However, she
had no
chest, arm, back, or neck pain during infusion or in recovery.
The
baseline t wave abnormalities did not change during exercise or
recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent apc's. There was
appropriate hemodynamic response. The dipyridamole was reversed
with
125mg of aminophylline.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms and no significant ST
segment
changes from baseline. Nuclear report to be sent separately.
