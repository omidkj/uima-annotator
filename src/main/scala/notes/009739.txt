History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] is a 52 year-old man with history of HIV and
Hepatitis
C infection who presented in winter [**2193**] with history of right

that
showed a spiculated mass in right lung apex.  A biopsy was taken
and Pathology described it as Non-small cell carcinoma,
consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. A  medisatinoscopy was
done in  [**2195-4-2**] which didn't show evidence of lymph node
involvement. The patient started neo-adjuvant chemoradiation in
[**2195-4-23**] and completed radiation on [**2195-6-4**] complicated by
severe hematologic toxicity from his chemotherapy.

Pertinent Results:
[**8-4**] CTC: The pre-existing subtotal consolidation of the left
lowerlobe has markedly improved. The right upper lobe spiculated
mass appears minimally smaller than at the last examination. The
extent of pleural thickening is unchanged. No new lesions have
occurred in the right upper lobe. Overall slight regression in
size of mediastinal lymph nodes.

[**8-23**] post ws CXR: slight interval increase in R apical ptx; with
air extending towards chest wall, improved lung aeration with
partial resolution of mulitfocal cosilidations although still
present.  Stomach [**Month/Year (2) 65**] inflated, advance doboff.
[**8-25**]:right pneumothorax decreased, now small to moderate. Right
apical air pocket is unchanged. Dobhoff tube ends in the
stomach.Diffuse parenchymal opacities, more marked on the left
are grossly unchanged, could be infectious. No other change.
[**8-22**]: RUQ us no evidence cholelithiasis
[**8-29**]; pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities are
unchanged.  right apical postoperative lesions and the
pre-existing right-sided rib lesions also unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
pt admitted and taken to the OR on [**2195-8-14**] for Right exploratory
thoracoscopy; right thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy with
en bloc chest wall resection
ribs 2, 3, 4 and 5; reconstruction with [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex mesh; thoracic
lymphadenectomy.
An epidural was placed for pain control and was split
(epidural/PCA) on POD#1 for improved pain control. 2 chest tubes
were placed at the time of surgery and was placed on sxn
w/positive air leak.
ID was consulted for ongoing follow up for previous LLL which
grew out aspergilus fungatus/mycelia on BAL [**2195-7-10**] and was being
treated w/ voriconazole and bactrim suppression therapy.

On POD#2 Pt was seen by RT for sxning for low O2 sats w/ copious
secretions. required 100% NRB and was subsequently transferred
to the ICU for resp distress. Was intubated and bronched for
copious secretions for presumed aspiration PNA. Food particles
were sxn from airways during bronch. CXR w/ RLL collapse.
Started on broad spectrum abx- vanco/zosyn. Micro from serial
BAL's revealed no growth.
POD#3 bronch done for pul tiolet to remove secretions from LUL
as seen by LUL collapse on CXR. Extubated but failed d/t
inability to manage secretions and required re-intubation in
8hrs.
POD#4 epidural migrated out and was d/c'd.
POD#5 hypotensive and was treated w/ IVF and intermittant
pressors, propofol was decreased. Bronch'd for pul tiolet nd
extubation failed again requiring reintubation.
POD#6 one of the chest tubes was removed and the other tube
remained on sxn. Oral feeding tube was placed for tube feeds.
POD#7 Trach performed. Required intermittant neo/IVF boluses for
BP support. Chest tube to water seal.
POD#[**7-12**] chest tube d/c'd. Weaning vent slowly. Heme was
consulted for low PLT count which was felt to be multifactorial.
Pt did rec transfusion of PLTS and PRBC.
POD# 11- 17 Cont'd to have difficulty weaning from the vent w/
periods of agitation. neuro was consulted and felt MS changes
were d/t delirium.
POD# 18 failed swallow. Eval for PEG.
POD# 20 peg placed.
POD#21 progressed well MS cleared, weaned from vent, started
feeds. transferred from the ICU to the floor.
POD# 22 pt transferred to the icu after he developed somulence
w/ passey muir valve in place. hypercarbic. Passey muir valve
removed, symptoms improved.
POD#23 Pt transferred from the icu to the floor. Remains NPO on
tube feeds at goal. Passed swallow for nectar thick liqs and
pureed but will NOT start po's until re-assessed at follow up
visit. [**Last Name (un) **] passey muir valve.

Intermittantly required pressors for hypotension
