History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14879**] is a 75 year-old gentleman with atrial fibrillation
status post cardioversion x 2, dilated cardiomyopathy with EF of
15% s/p ICD placement, pulmonary embolism on coumadin, adrenal
insufficiency, and pneumonia who presented from nursing home to
the ED with shortness of breath, fever, and cough productive of
yellow sputum.

In the ED, initial VS: T 102.0, P 100, BP 112/51, RR 40.  He was
intubated for tachypnea and progressive tiring from increased
work of breathing though he was not hypoxic.  CXR showed
multifocal pneumonia with bilateral fluffy infiltrates.  Labs
were significant for elevated WBC count of 15.5 with 80% polys,
HCT at 28.7 (baseline mid 30s), and acute renal failure with Cr
1.6 (unclear baseline) with U/A WNL.

Blood, urine and viral cultures were all sent, and he was
treated empirically with Vancomycin (despite listed allergy of
diarrhea to this), levofloxacin, clindamycin, and oseltamavir
while viral cultures were pending. IV access was obtained with
an IJ CVL. He was given 5.5L IVF and started on fentanyl and
midazolam gtts for sedation as well as norepinephrine 0.18
mcg/kg/min for BPs that dipped to MAP of 40s. He was then
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
