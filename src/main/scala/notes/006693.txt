History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of DM, HL, CM, CAD
s/p PCIs and atrial fibrillation. In [**2172-9-2**] he was
referred back to the [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab because of symptoms of
shortness of breath and congestive heart failure. Cardiac
catheterization on [**2172-9-8**] did not reveal any significant
obstructive CAD. RVEDP was noted at 33 mmHG with a mean wedge of

32 mmHG. There was severe pulmonary artery hypertension. He was

diuresed at that time. Stress testing in [**2171-12-3**] had
revealed a predominantly fixed inferior apical defect with an
LVEF of 46% and somewhat dilated LV chamber.

The patient presented for Afib ablation today. Patient underwent
PVI with additional lines and failed cardioversion. He was given
1mg ibutilide and developed QT prolongation to 800ms which
transitioned to vfib. He was shocked and rhythm became sinus and
then slow afib. He was admitted to the CCU for close monitoring.


On review of systems, he denies SOB, CP, LE pain,
numbness/tingling, lightheadedness. Reports had been in USOH
prior to this elective procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo m with CAD and chronic afib admitted for cardioversion.

# Atrial fibrillation: (see HPI for more details) Went for PVI
with ablation, was unsuccessful. He was given 1mg ibutilide and
developed QT prolongation to 800ms which transitioned to vfib.
He was shocked and rhythm became sinus and then slow afib. At
discharge he was still in slow afib. He was started on amio
400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week, 400mg Qday x 1 week, then 200mg. Also on CCB
and dig home doses. Restarted on coumadin at discharge, but
subtheraputic. Was started on lovenox bridge with 60mg [**Hospital1 **]. Will
have INR checked in 2 days. Plan for out pt f/u with MRI to
evaluate pulmonary veins and then out pt cardioversion with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Will also have follow up with his regular
cardiologist and PCP.

# Coronary artery disease: Had known CAD, s/p PCI x 2 [**2168**], cath
in [**2171**] revealed no flow limiting disease. Was stable during
admission.
-Continue ASA, statin, BB, ACEI
-Cardiac diet

# chronic systolic HF: Last EF based on MR was 45% with mildly
increased cavity size and mild global hypokinesis. Was stable
during admission. Continued on home lasix, metazolone,
spironolactone.

# Hypotension: Pt has HTN at baseline. Post-procedure SBPs in
80s. Given one 500cc bolus of NS. HR in 60-70s at time. Pulsus
10mmHg. Asymptomatic. Potentially vagal rxn. Hcts were stable
and blood pressure improved before discharge, home meds were
restarted.

# DM- was on sliding scale insulin, was restarted on Lantus, but
the dose was increased to 24units in the morning. Glyburide was
stopped due to possiblly causing arrythmias.  Instead he was
started on Metformin 500mg [**Hospital1 **].
