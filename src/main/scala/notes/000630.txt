Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7729**]
Chief Complaint:
Tongue Cancer


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-4-21**]: left hemiglossectomy, bilateral neck dissection, and
split thickness skin graft


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3065**] is a 69-year-old gentleman with a history of cT1N0M0
moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of
the tongue.  Given the extent of pain that he is in, he cannot
allow for a full digital exam and it is very difficult to see
between his tongue and jaw, so the tumor visibly
approaches the midline.  No pathologic nodes were identified on
CT scan.  It is recommended that he undergo primary surgical
excision, and after discussion of the risks and benefits of the
procedure, the patient and his family have decided to pursue
this treatment plan.

Past Medical History:
COPD
atrial fibrillation
diastolic congestive heart failure
chronic kidney disease
hypertension,
glaucoma
hyperlipidemia
history of DVT.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Status post IVC filter in [**2084**]
bilateral cataract surgery.


Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3065**] is originally from [**Country 15800**].
He is married and lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 2312**].  He
previously
worked as an economist, retired approximately five years ago.
He
has five adult children.
Tobacco: none.
Alcohol:  Previously consumed alcohol, but quit approximately 25
years ago.


Family History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3065**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2101-4-21**] to undergo a left
hemiglossectomy, bilateral neck dissection, and split thickness
skin graft reconstruction.  He tolerated the procedure well;
please see the separately dictated operative report for details
of the procedure.  Given the extent of resection, he was kept
intubated overnight and was successfully extubated the next
morning.  He received a short course of post-operative steroids.
 He was then transferred to the surgical floor on [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 7.

The remainder of his hospital course by system:

###HEENT: He was transferred to the floor with 2 JP drains in
his neck and an intraoral bolster in place over the skin graft.
The drains were removed as they met criteria on POD#3 and 4.
The bolster was removed on POD#5 and the skin graft showed 100%
take.  His neck incision healed well, although he developed some
mild superior flap edema on POD#[**4-24**].  The staples were removed
from his neck incision on POD#8, and the incision was healing
well without evidence of dehiscence.

###Neuro:  He initially received IV morphine for pain control
and was subsequently transitioned to oxycodone liquid PT on
POD#2.  By the time of discharge, he was receiving only standing
acetaminophen every 6 hours for pain; this will be changed to a
PRN medication at the time of discharge.  He also had a few
minor intermittent episodes of confusion or forgetfulness
consistent with delirium, but he was easily redirectable by his
staff and family.

###CV: He was tachycardic postoperatively, and after his heart
rate did not respond to adequate IV fluid boluses (as measured
by an appropriate urine output), a medicine consult was obtained
given his history of DVT/PE and cardiomyopathy. An EKG showed
sinus tachycardia, and a PE-protocol CT was performed.  This was
negative for embolus but did show a right lower lobe pneumonia.
Troponins were negative x3.  His tachycardia resolved over the
next few days.  His antihypertensives were initially held, as he
had some mild hypotension to the 80's and 90's.  This resolved
with the tachycardia, and by POD#7, his home antihypertensive
regimen was resumed with adequate blood pressure control.

###Pulm: He was diagnosed with a right lower lobe pneumonia
after the PE-protocol CT on POD#1.  He remained stable on room
air for his entire hospital course, although he did have a
productive cough for the first few days.  Sputum culture
eventually grew Citrobacter koseri and Enterobacter aerogenes,
both sensitive to fluoroquinolones; commensal respiratory flora
was absent.  He received standing nebulizer treatments for a few
days with good effect and resolution of his cough.

###GI:  Tube feeds were started on POD#1 after extubation.  They
were quickly advanced to goal and he tolerated them well without
nausea. After the bolster was removed on POD#5, he was evaluated
by Speech and Swallow for possible initiation of an oral diet.
They recommended clear liquids given that although he showed no
signs of aspiration, he had difficulty with oral manipulation of
food boluses given the exten of his surgical resection.  They
also recommended a video swallow evaluation, which was done on
POD#7.  This showed a normal pharyngeal swallow but again,
difficulty with oral preparation.  It was decided that he would
continue with tube feeds for nutrition while he continued to
work on his swallow ability with the therapists.  He was
discharged on tube feeds and an oral full liquid diet.  The NG
tube can be removed if he can take adequate POs.  The patient
did not wish to consider a G tube at this time, although the
possibility was discussed.

###GU:  A Foley was placed intraoperatively, and this was
continued post-operatively for aid in fluid management.  It was
removed on POD#3 when his tachycardia had stabilized.  He was
subsequently able to void independently.  His creatinine
remained stable at his preoperative baseline (1.2-1.4).

###Heme:  His post-operative hematocrit dropped to 31, where it
remained stable.  He did not receive any blood transfusions.  On
POD#3, it was noted that he had asymmetric edema of his upper
extremities, and ultrasound examination revealed a DVT in his
left arm.  He had restarted his coumadin on POD#3 but after
identification of the clot, he was also started on a lovenox
bridge.  His INR was therapeutic on POD#6 and the lovenox was
stopped.

###ID:  He was started on Ancef post-operatively for prophylaxis
while the bolster was in place.  This was changed to IV
ciprofloxacin for the right lower lobe pneumonia which was then
changed to Zosyn and azithromycin the next day to cover for
ventilator-associated pneumonia seen on PE-CT.  After 48 hours,
he was changed to oral levofloxacin.  He completed a 7-day
course of antibiotics with normalization of his leukocytosis.

###Endocrine: The patient's blood glucose was controlled with a
regular insulin sliding scale, which he tolerated well.  A TSH
was checked for the tachycardia workup and was normal.

By POD#8, the patient was deemed ready for discharge to a rehab
facility.  He and his family agreed with the plan and were eager
to move forward with his care.

His CT scan showed incidental findings of left axillary
lymphadenopathy and small pulmonary nodules.  The
lymphadenopathy should be addressed at outpatient follow up with
hematology/oncology.  His PCP should follow up the pulmonary
nodules.  He will require chemoradiation therapy, and will
follow up with radiation oncology as well as hematology/oncology
as an outpatient.
