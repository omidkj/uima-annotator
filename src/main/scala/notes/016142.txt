History of Present Illness:
79yo man with laryngeal SCC s/p trach/PEG tx. with chemo and
radiation, recently diagnosed lung adenoma in [**Month (only) **]., COPD, CAD,
with shortness of breath, hypoxia, increased agitation and
increased trach secretions from [**Hospital3 **]. He was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital1 336**], where he has received all his medical
care, in [**8-29**] with Pseudomonas pna, treated initially with
zosyn X 10d, then when repeat cx. showed pseudomonas, he was
started on meropenem and transitioned to cipro after
sensitivities returned.  At that admission also had CT-guided
bx. diagnosing adenoCa.  Of note also was treated during this
hospitalization with keflex for PEG tube superficial infection
and flagyl presumptively for c. Diff. despite negative C. Diff
tests.  He has recently completed his radiation treatments and
was transferred ~10d ago to [**Hospital3 **] from [**Hospital1 **].

thick tan sputum suctioned from trach. EKG w/ no [**Hospital1 65**] ST/T

monitoring and trach suctioning.

CXR [**11-11**]
AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:  No prior studies available for
comparison.  There is a tracheostomy tube in place.  Right-sided
subclavian central line with its tip in the mid SVC.  Although
this radiograph is somewhat difficult to interpret due to
patient positioning and low position of the left
scapula/clavicle, there is a left apical airspace opacity with
volume loss and traction bronchiectasis, likely chronic.
Remainder of the lungs are clear. There may be a component of
underlying emphysema.
IMPRESSION:  Left apical opacity with volume loss and traction
bronchiectasis, likely chronic. (Is there a history of
malignancy, prior radiation, or tuberculosis?) In the correct
clinical setting, this could represent acute pneumonia, but this
is thought less likely. Correlation with prior studies would be
helpful and follow up to resolution if warranted.
.
CXR [**11-13**]:IMPRESSION:
1. New left basilar ill-defined opacity may reflect an evolving
pneumonia.
2. Stable left apical opacity, unclear if this is a chronic or
an acute on chronic process, prior examinations would be useful.
Recommend a follow up to resolution.
.
EKG:Sinus tachycardia. Normal tracing, except for rate. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75448**] is 79 year-old man with laryngeal cancer s/p
trach/PEG tx. with chemo and radiation, recent diagnosis of lung
adenoca in [**Month (only) **]., COPD, CAD,  p/w shortness of breath, hypoxia,
increased agitation and increased trach secretions found to have
pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory distress: At presentation this seemed to be more
consistent with a COPD exacerbation and likely had mucus plug
that has cleared in ED with aggressive suctioning.  He was
continued on supplemental oxygen via trach mask. He was started
on a short course prednisone 60mg for 4 days as well as
vancomycin  and zosyn for COPD exacerbation, dosed per CrCl (day
1 [**11-11**]). Vancomycin stopped on [**11-16**], zosyn stopped [**11-18**]. PT
completed 7 day course. Repeat CXR suggested PNA.  A sputum
culture was sent, mucinex given to loosen secretions.  He was
started on chest PT and continued on his home regimen of
spiriva, albuterol/atrovent nebulizer treatment. Respiratory
care followed the patient daily. He was placed on 35% TM for
humidity to help with secretions.
.
# Abdominal pain: Initially had some left lower quadrant
tenderness on exam.  Serial exams were performed and no further
abdominal pain was elicited. Peg tube site, C/D/I without
discharge.
.
# Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma/adenocarcinoma of the lung
with chronic pain: He was continued on his fentanyl patch and
PRN magic mouthwash. He has a trach and PEG for feeding as he is
unable to tolerate PO as per swallowing evaluation.
.
# palliative care consult for discussion regarding further care
of SCC and lung adenocarcinoma. A family meeting was held on
[**11-18**] to discuss goals of care and code status. Family decided
that they wanted the patient to return to [**Hospital3 2558**] for
rehab with the hopes that he may be able to return home one day
with services. Pt's family declined palliative/hospice care at
this time and decided that pt would see his oncologist next week
otherwise he has an appointment on [**2194-12-13**].
.
# Anemia: He was continued on supplemental iron.  Aranesp was
held as this medication is non-formulary. Hct was trended and
remained stable.
.
# Depression/Psych: He was continued on his home dose celexa,
risperdal.  He received several doses of haldol for agitation.
Olanzapine given prn.
.
# CAD: He was continued on his statin and started on low dose
aspirin.
.
# FEN: Jevity 1.2 TFs as prior to admit.

# Access: Portacath (not accessed) and 2 PIVs

# DVT prophylaxis: Heparin SC
.
# Code status: FULL CODE
