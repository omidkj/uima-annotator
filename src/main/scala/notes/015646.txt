Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7539**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICU stay

History of Present Illness:
75M with h/o CAD s/p CABG (last cath [**6-7**] with severe 3-vessel
disease) who p/w acute shortness of breath, R-back pain. Pt was
treated at OSH emergency dept with solumdedrol, lasix, ASA,
lovenox. Cardiac enzymes were elevated at OSH; ECG reportedly
with St depressions anterolat leads, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath, which showed 90% left main disease.
Post-procedure, in cath holding area, pt developed bradycardia,
hypotension, and RLQ abdom pain. Dopamine & IV fluids were given
without much effect. Stat CT scan showed large retroperitoneal
bleed. Pt was taken back to cath lab for peripheral
images/tamponade of bleeding artery and then admitted to CCU.

Past Medical History:
CAD s/p CABG; myocardial infarction in [**2150**]
diabetes mellitus
asthma
COPD
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair

Social History:
previous smoker

Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
afebrile, HR 100, BP 121/85, 95% on 2L NC
+RLQ abdom tenderness
S1S2 RRR, no murmurs
lungs CTA bilat
no femoral bruits
2+ DP pulses

Pertinent Results:
CT: large RP bleed
CK 231
BM 8.4
ABG 7.42 / 37/ 99
WBC 9.3
Hct 40.5
Plt 201
ECG: sinus. Poor R-wave progression. L-axis, Incomplete RBBB.

Brief Hospital Course:
75M with h/o DM, HTN, COPD, AAA, and known severe CAD p/w chest
pain, s/p cath with PTCA of LM->ramus. Found to have
retroperitoneal bleed stabilized by balloon tamponade, admitted
to CCU for close observation.

# Retroperitoneal bleed: seen on CT scan after suggestive
symptoms and signs in cath holding area post-procedure. Bleeding
femoral artery was successfully stabilized in 2nd cath procedure
via balloon tamponade. Hct was followed closely. Vascular
surgery followed pt closely. Repeat CT scan on [**2171-1-12**] showed an
unchanged RP bleed.

# Coronary artery disease: NSTEMI at OSH, s/p LM->ramus stent at
cath here, but severe native and graft disease seen at cath.
Plavix & integrillin were held due to large RP bleed. ASA &
lipitor were continued.

# Hypotension: patient remained hypotensive despite being on
multiple pressor agents including dopamine & neosynephrine. At
7:10 pm on [**1-12**], pt suddenly became bradycardic to 30s and
hypotensive to 60s despite being on multiple pressors. Pt was
coded, including atropine, bicarbonate. Pt did not recover and
he was pronounced dead at 9:06 pm by CCU fellow.

# Respiratory: pt was intubated on [**2171-1-11**] for respiratory
distress and RR>30. Pt remained intubated until he expired.

# Acute renal failure: creatinine increased from 1.1 at transfer
to >2. Pt became anuric. Likely secondary to hypotension from
large bleed. Renal was consulted & followed closely. Patient
became increasingly acidemic despite full resuscitative efforts,
likely as a result of continued hypotension despite being on
multiple pressors. Patient's lactate increased to 14.2. On [**1-12**], CVVH was initiated for K+ 5.7 and continued renal failure &
acidemia.

# Communicated with family several times per day with all
changes in status.
