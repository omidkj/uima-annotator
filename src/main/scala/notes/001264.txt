Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
.
44M with hx of AIDS, CD4 of 84, substance abuse, depression and
hx of suicide attempts who presents with benzo overdose,
intubated for airway protection, developed PNA and fever, and
jaundic during ICU stay which quickly resolved.
.
1. benzo overdose/Altered mental status:
Assessed to be [**3-11**] overdose. The urine was pos for benzo,
cocaine and amphetamines.
The pt was intubated in the ED for airway protection and
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was ventilated overnight, then successfully
extubated on [**12-13**]. The pt remained somnolent, requiring loud
verbal stimuli to arouse. This was thought [**3-11**] depression as
well as resolving acute illness. The LOC continued to improve.
Given the clear explanations for mental status changes, further
work-up was deferred including LP to rule out meningitis and
head CT. ID consultants agreed with this decision. The pt was
monitored on a CIWA scale as an inpatient for 4 days, and he
demonstrated no clear symptoms of withdrawal.
.
2. PNA:
The pt was noted to be febrile to 101.5 in the ICU, his CXR
showed LLL infiltrate. Levo/flagyl was initially started and the
pt responded well with the infiltrate mostly resolved by CXR on
[**12-15**]. The coverage was narrowed to levoflox alone to continue a
10 day course. Bld Cx were negative. [**Last Name (un) **] Cx showed enterococci
Sensitive to levo, assessed to be colonization by ID. stool
negative for C.diff. Pt was afebrile x48 hours at discharge.
.
3. Elevated LFTs/cholestatic jaundice:
Likely acalculous cholecystitis. On reviewing the pt's previous
labs, he has had elevated AST and ALT in the past, likely [**3-11**]
his HAART regimen or hepatitis.  However, his bilirubin has not
been this elevated in the past. AST/ALT peak on [**12-12**] 608/224. T.
bili elevated to 6 at admission. The bilirubin and liver enzymes
continued to trend down over the hospital stay. RUQ US
demonstrated no evidence of stones or ductal dilatation but
showed sludge.

4. HIV/AIDS:
Recent testing done on [**2105-11-12**] at his PCP's visit.  CD4 84 (8%)
down from 126 and VL now detectable at 10,800 copies.
Lamivudine/Abacavir/Atazanavir is home regimen. The pt reports
good compliance but according to past notes, misses approx one
dose per week.  His HIV genotyping is pending to assess for
resistance mutations. Per ID consultants the ART was held in the
setting of acute illness and will be restarted as an outpt. OI
prophylaxis was continued with atovaquone, biaxin, famvir. The
pt sees Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3640**] for ID last seen [**2105-7-30**].
.
5. Depression:
s/p suicide attempt. pt is involuntary admit. Outpt Pschiatrist
is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7339**]. The psychiatry team was consulted and followed
along. His psych meds were held for sedation during the
admission per recs, including the effexor, wellbutrin and
trazodone. CIWA scale with diazepam was continued for possible
benzo withdrawal, although the pt demonstrated no clear symptoms
of withdrawal since the admission. 1:1 sitter was continued
because of suicidal intent.
.
6. Thrombocytopenia:
Chronic, baseline between 43-75; follow and transfuse for<10
unless active bleeding
.
7. Rhabdomolysis:
Likely [**3-11**] being down for several hours. CK was trended and
declined without any other symptoms. No renal problems
developed.
8. FEN: NPO until extubated
9. PPx: pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
