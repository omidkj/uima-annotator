History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 110142**] is a 59 year old man who presents as an OSH
trasnfer for
ICH.  Per report from [**Location (un) **], the patient had complained to
his wife for 3 weeks of uncontrollable intermittent twitching
above his R eye.  Today ([**6-18**]), the patient went out for a
drive, and on returning, his wife heard a thump outside of their
house,and when she went to look, saw the pt stupourous and
unsteadily walking in circles until he came up to the door,
where he leaned
on it, then slumped on it and hit his head on the way down to
the floor.  Per report, he then had a 1 min seizure prior to
EMS's arrival, but we don't have a report of the seizure
semiology.  When EMS arrived, he was found to be unresponsive
with a R upward gaze/possible eye deviation.  He was brought to
an OSH, where a head CT was completed, showing a  ICH (4.9 x 4.2
cm area of hemorrhage within R frontal lobe extending into the R
lateral ventricle, no fx, no c/s fx per OSH rad report). Pt has
no history of antiplatelets or
anticoagulation, but INR was found to be 1.7 at the OSH. Pt was
then intubated with lido 100mg, etomidate 20mg, rocuronium 50mg
and maintained on 30mg propofol.  He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
neurosurgical evaluation.

On presenation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was intubated, sedated and
minimally responsive, with some spontaneous movement of the RUE
and LLE.  While he was being evaluated he had an episode of
eyelid fluttering and mouth twitching with tachycardia to the
130's that was felt to be seizure activity, so he was bolused
with propofol and given 2mg IV ativan. The fluttering/twitching
stopped.  He again later in the ED had another episode with R
arm twitching and was again given 2mg IV ativan and it stopped.
He had a CTA that showed extension of the bleed into both
lateral ventricles.  His Utox returned positive for amphetamines
but negative for cocaine.

CXR [**2185-6-18**]:
Endotracheal tube and enteric tube appear in position. Mild
increased central venous pressure with no acute cardiopulmonary
process
otherwise identified.

CT C-spine [**2185-6-18**]
1.  No evidence of acute fracture or alignment abnormality.
2.  Moderate degenerative changes, most severe at C5-C6 and
C6-C7, with
moderately severe spinal canal and bilateral neural foraminal
narrowing.
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: The severe degenerative disease
at C5/6 and C6/7, with associated angular kyphosis at the
former, and likely underlying dextroscoliosis, result in
relatively severe canal stenosis with flattening of the ventral
thecal sac.  If there is appropriate mechanism of trauma, and
suspicion of cord injury (e.g. new myelopathic symptoms),
consideration should be given to MRI, if feasible.

ECHOcardiogram [**2185-6-19**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mildly depressed left
ventricular function. Good right ventricular systolic function.
Anterior fat pad.

CTA head [**6-19**]..wet read

CXR [**2185-6-19**]
Mild increased right lobe opacities suggesting mild atelectasis
versus new aspiration.

CXR [**2185-6-19**] no read

LENS [**2185-6-19**]
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right or left leg.

ECHO [**6-20**]
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with 35-40%. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is mild to moderate aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Liver US [**6-20**]
Cirrhosis, with sluggish and reversed flow within the main
portal
vein.

CXR [**6-21**]
Right lower lung consolidation further resolved and mild
asymmetric pulmonary edema has significantly improved over last
24 hours.


Brief Hospital Course:
EU Critical [**Doctor First Name **] (first name [**Known firstname **] per report), is a 59 yo
male with an unconfirmed PMHx who presented as an OSH transfer
for ICH then found to have extension of the hemorrhage into both
lateral ventricles with a positive Utox for amphetamines.  He
was admitted to the neuro ICU.  He was given 2 units of FFP for
his INR of 1.6.  He was loaded with fosphenytoin in the ED to
prevent seizures, and continued on PRN ativan in addition.
Phenytoin level was 11.1 on [**2185-6-19**].

In am on [**6-19**], he was hypotenisve and pressors were started. He
was up to three agents in the afternoon with persistant
hypotension. He was having respiratory issues on the ventilator
and he had to be paralyzed.

Prior to this, he localized and was spontaneously moving his
upper extremities.  HE WD his lower extremities to noxious
stimuli. Pupils were equal and reactive.

His chest X-ray revealed right sided pneumonia consistent with
aspiration. He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  LENS were
done and ruled out DVT, he was unsafe for travel for CTA to rule
out PE. He developed sepsis and [**Last Name (un) **] monitor was place. MAP was
50-60 and fluid blouses were given.

Echocardiogram revealed LVEF 50%. Cardiac enzymes were sent.
They showed a trop of 0.07. The patient was then paralyzed as
his ventilation was difficult to maintain.  His INR climbed to
2.6 and his PTT to 77 without any anticoagulation, and likely
[**3-3**] liver failure.

A family meeting was held which determined that the patient
would be aggressively managed for 24 hours then if he had no
response, the decision would be made for likely terminal
extubation.

On [**6-21**] it was noted that his right pupil was 4mm and very
minimally reactive and his left pupil was 2mm and minimally
reactive. After discussion with family it was determined that
they would pr
