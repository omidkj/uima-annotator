Pertinent Results:
Pathology Report [**2133-10-12**]:
I.  Level 7 lymph nodes (A-J): Twenty four lymph nodes with no
carcinoma seen (0/24).
II.  Esophagogastrectomy (K-AK):Poorly differentiated invasive
adenocarcinoma, arising in the proximal fundus/distal
gastroesophageal junction, most consistent with a gastric
origin; see synoptic report and comments.
III.  Lesser curvature gastric lymph nodes ([**Doctor Last Name **]-AN):One of two
lymph nodes, positive for metastatic carcinoma ([**11-29**]).
IV.  Gastric fundus (AO-AR):Segment of gastric fundus/corpus
with no carcinoma seen.
V.  "Esophageal donuts" (AS-AY):Esophageal and gastric fundic
fragments with no carcinoma seen.

Barium Esophagogram [**2133-10-18**]:
Small leak at esophago-gastric anastomosis, possibly contained.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2133-10-12**] by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she had an [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy. She was
extubated in the OR, then brought to the ICU for initial
monitoring, with epidural, JP, right Chest tube and NGT, and was
kept NPO, with IV fluids.
She had pain on arrival to the SICU, and was bolused w/dilaudid
then split epidural.  She also had high blood sugars, with a
history of poorly controlled DM at home, and was seen by [**Last Name (un) **]
post-op.  She was recovering well and transferred to the floor
on the evening of POD 3.  She had pain issues, which improved
when her epidural was replaced on POD 4.
She was doing well on the floor POD 4 and 5.  She had a mild
cough but was otherwise asymptomatic.
On POD 6 her JP output changed from serous to brown fluid and
she was started on zosyn, cipro, and flagyl.  A barium swallow
was obtained at that time, which showed a small leak at the
anastomosis, which appeared to be contained.
On POD 7 she developed copious, foul-smelling respiratory
secretions, as well as air output into her JP drain with
respiration and coughing.  Her cough worsened and she required
increased nasal cannula oxygen.  Her WBC count rose to 13 and
her antibiotics were broadened to vanc, zosyn, and diflucan.
She remained hemodynamically stable.  She was taken to the OR
for EGD and bronchoscopy, which revealed a large fistula between
her trachea and her gastric conduit, as well as necrosis of the
proximal 5-6cm of her conduit.  She was kept intubated after
procedures and taken to the ICU.
On POD 8 she remained intubated and sedated.  After discussion
of the high morbidity associated with any further operations and
the prognosis and quality of life after surgery, her family
elected to make her comfort measures only.  She remained in the
ICU and expired at 5:15pm on [**2133-10-20**].
