Rads:
[**6-1**] Right LENI: no DVT
.
[**6-2**] Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**6-4**] CT A Head and neck:
1. Large evolving subacute left MCA territory infarction,
demonstrating luxury perfusion and a few tiny foci of hyperdense
component posteriorly perhaps representing a tiny amount of
hemorrhagic transformation.
2. Short segment occlusion of the M2 portion of the left MCA,
best demonstrated on the 3D volume/snapshot images.
3. Two ill-defined nodular opacities at the right lung apex
which may be inflammatory/infectious, though followup to
resolution is recommended.
.
[**6-5**] right knee: Assessment for joint effusion is limited by
positioning. No fracture is evident. Joint spaces are
unremarkable on nonweightbearing views. Regional soft tissues
are unremarkable. No periarticular erosions are identified.
Osseous remodeling of the inferior pole of the patella may
represent the sequela of remote trauma.
.
[**6-6**] echo: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast at rest x 2. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No vegetations are seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure: Etiology not entirely clear.  A swan was
placed which demonstrated lower than expected cardiac output and
cardiac index.  We felt that diastolic dysfunction leading to
acute pulmonary edema was a primary contributor.  She was
diuresed aggressively with improvement in her CXR findings and
exam but she remained intubated for several days.  Other factors
included likely aspiration pneumonia in the setting of her
hypoxia and increased work of breathing.  We also were concerned
about pulmonary embolus given her large A-a gradient.  She was
empirically anticoagulated with heparin although a CTA was not
obtained given her high travel risk.  Ultimately, since her
respiratory status improved with diuresis and antibiotics, PE
was considered lower on the differential.  Pt was weaned off the
ventilator and extubated on [**6-7**], after which she continued to
do well.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and EKGs were obtained; however,
this was thought not to be a primary ischemic event. During her
admission Plavix was held due to coffee ground in NG fluid
during time of heparin gtt, but this was restarted on day of
discharge.
.
During admission ECG and telemetry suggested that her pacer
intermittently paced.  Her underl
