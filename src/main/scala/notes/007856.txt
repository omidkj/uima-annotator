Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was BIBA to [**Hospital1 18**] ER s/p fall off of ladder with LOC.  He was
admitted to the trauma team for the first 24 hours.  He was then
taken over by the neurosurgery service as he was an isolated
head injury.  CT scan in the ED revealed bifrontal contusions
with left sdh.  He was given a six pack of plts in the ED as he
was taking asa 325mg daily.  He was also loaded with Dilantin
for sz prophylaxis.

On arrival it was also noted that he had afib/aflutter with RVR.
 This continued intermittently throughout his hospital stay,
requiring cardiology consult. He required ICU care for titration
of Diltiazem and Amiodarone drip. His rate was eventually
controlled with Amiodarone 400 mg PO and Diltiazem 60 mg PO. An
echo showed mild pulm artery systolic HTN with R ventricular/R+L
atrial enlargement. Mr [**Known lastname 39859**] should follow up with Cardiology
in 2 weeks for ablation.

On trauma evaluation a CT scan of the chest was performed.  The
findings indicate that the pt has a pulmonary nodule that
requires outpt follow up.

On [**11-19**] patient was to be transferred to the step down unit
with a 1:1 sitter; however, patient went We requested psychiatry
due to his impulsive behavior. Psychiatry they titrated his
Lithium dose for his known bipolar disorder. . We have also
discussed this with his psychiatrist, Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital 1191**]
hospital who stated patient has dx of atypical bipolar and does
not need the Lithium with his current head injury but should
resume after he has recovered from these injuries.

His mental status, behavior issues and appetite improved on
daily basis.
PT and OT recommended acute rehabilitation for the patient. On
[**12-2**] pt was neurologically stable and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 **].
