S/P Fall with Agitation

History of Present Illness:
The paitent is an 87 year old man with a history of HTN, CKD,
CHF (EF>55%) who presented from an outside hospital (OSH) with
suspected meningitis. He was in his usual state of health until
[**2169-3-16**], one week prior to admission to this hospital
when he developed a rash on the upper portion of his right face.
He then went to his primary doctor, who diagnosed him with
facial Zoster and prescribed him Valtrex 1 g TID. Later that
day, per his wife, he began having intermittent visual and
auditory hallucinations along with progressive and intermittent
confusion. He also had a stiff neck. There were no fevers,
chills or rigors. He was seen by an ophthomologist on [**3-21**], [**2168**], with a reportedly normal exam.

On the night prior to admission to this hospital, he had an
unwitnessed fall with head trauma (but no loss of consiousness
or reported seizure-like activity). His wife called EMS and he
was transported to an OSH emergency [**Hospital1 **]. He was noted to be
agitated and was then intubated for airway protection and for
lumbar puncture. A Head CT was negative. His CSF had 11 WBC, 280
RBC, 58 Glucose, TP 82 (it was deemed a possible traumatic tap
as he was status-post multiple attempts). An opening pressure
was not recorded. He was covered empirically with Ceftriaxone as
well as Azithromycin for a possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
He was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further care.

[**Hospital1 18**] ED: He arrived intubated with a temperature of 102.8.
Acyclovir and Vancomycin were added to his regimen.

Past Medical History:
CHF ([**9-/2168**]: EF 60-65%), CKD (Baseline Cr 2.7-2.7) S/P LUE AVF
(In Prep for HD), Hypothyroidism, Gout, Emphysema/COPD, Anxiety,
S/P R THR x 2.

Social History:
He lived with his wife and was a prior smoker. There was not
history of excessive ETOH use or illicit drug use.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2169-3-23**]): IMPRESSION: ET tube in satisfactory position. No
evidence of pneumonia or CHF. Interstitial opacities that may
represent chronic lung disease.

HEAD CT ([**2169-3-26**]): There is a small amount of hyperdensity seen
in both right and left parietal lobes series 3, image 30 and 31.
This is likely due to volume averaging from the surrounding
osseous structures. No other areas of increased attenuation are
seen to suggest intracranial hemorrhage. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. There is no hydrocephalus or shift
of normally midline structures. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. Circumferential mucosal thickening is seen within
the sphenoid sinus. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear. Soft tissues are unremarkable.
Motion artifact somewhat limits the most inferior images.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW ([**2169-3-30**]): IMPRESSION: Trace
penetration and aspiration with thin liquid. For a detailed
discussion of the swallowing specialist's evaluation and
treatmet recommendations, please see the notes section of the
patient's online medical record.

EEG ([**2169-3-27**]): IMPRESSION - This is an abnormal routine EEG due
to the slow and disorganized background rhythm and bursts of
generalized slowing. These
findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition
affecting both
cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, metabolic
disease,
and infection are among the most common causes. There were no
focal
abnormalities. Also, encephalopathies might obscure focal
findings.
There were no epileptiform features.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 60914**] was admitted to the MICU and then transferred to
Medicine with a presumed Varicella-Zoster Virus
meningoencephalitis. He made dramatic neurologic recovery, on
acyclovir, over his hospital stay. His presentation was
complicated by a left lower lobe pneumonia and a right lower
extremity cellulitis.

87M H/O HTN, CKD, CHF (EF>55%) with facial VZV infection and
obtundation S/P ICU/Intubation Course for presumed viral
meningitis - also with LLL PNA and RLE cellulitis; continues to
make dramatic clinical improvement re: MS, but still dysarthric.

1) Meningoencephalitis: He presented with a change in mental
status, and concominant hallucinations. Given his extrememely
depressed consiousness on presentation to the outside hospital,
he was intubated for airway protection. Given his facial Zoster,
an infection and extension into the CNS was presumed. Head CT
showed only hyperdensities right and left parietal lobes (likely
artifact per Rads report). An EEG was consistent with
encephalopathy. An RPR, TSH and B12 were negative or normal. The
initial CSF was only mildly inflammatory (WBC of 11, TP of
82)which could have been consistent with a  possible VZV
meningitis (and encephilitis). HSV or alternate viral agents
were also possible. The OSH was not able to run CSF for viral
studies, but he was treated empirically for HSV and VZV with a
two week course of Acyclovir 800 mg IV Q24H. He was followed by
the ID service. Other bacterial agents were initially covered.
As mentioned, over the early and middle part of his course, he
was only arousable to painful stimuli and showed signs of
brainstem dysfunction (alternating tachynpea and bradypnea,
possible intermittent decorticate posturing, and asymmetric
pupils). He made dramatic improvement over a period of two to
three days and soon became oriented to person, place, time, was
able to follow all commands, joked with the medical team, passed
a swallowing evaluation, and participated (ambulated) with
physical therapy.

2) LLL PNA: The patient arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated (mainly for
airway protection) and not respiratory failure. A
