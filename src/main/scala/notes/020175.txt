HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known firstname 4580**] [**Known lastname **] is a
66-year-old male admitted to the Vascular Service on
[**2146-11-21**] and discharged on [**2146-12-21**].

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and
atrial fibrillation.  He is status post coronary artery
bypass graft two months prior to admission.  He was found to
have a large asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He
underwent angiography.  Angiography demonstrated that the
aneurysm extended into the right iliac.  The patient is now
admitted for elective aortic abdominal aneurysm resection.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Coumadin.
2.  Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.
3.  Amiodarone 200 mg daily.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient had a cardiovascular
accident without residual, hypertension, osteoarthritis,
COPD, MI, and chronic atrial fibrillation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  History included coronary artery
bypass grafting in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker, nondrinker.  The
patient was independently ambulating prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination showed vital signs stable.
HEENT:  Examination was unremarkable.  HEART:  Irregular rate
and rhythm with a median sternotomy incision, well healed.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation.  ABDOMEN:  Abdomen
was soft, nontender.  Abdominal aneurysm was nonpalpable.
EXTREMITIES:  Extremities showed femoral pulses intact.  The
right DP was Dopplerable. The right PT was palpable.  The
left pedal pulses were palpable, both DP and PT.  RECTAL:
Rectal examination revealed increased prostate size, guaiac
negative.



HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Preoperative Holding Area on [**2146-11-22**].  He underwent
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with an aortobifemoral
bypass graft with a re-implanted [**Female First Name (un) 899**] artery with PFT.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition.

On postoperative day #1, he remained hemodynamically stable.
The Lopressor was increased to manage his hypertension.
Anticoagulation was begun for the chronic atrial
fibrillation.  He was converted to a PCA.

On postoperative day #3 abdominal examination was
unremarkable.  There were bowel sounds present, but no
flatus.  POs were held.  The PA catheter was converted to
CVL.

On postoperative day #3, the patient needed continued
diuresis and the CVL was changed to a left subclavian without
difficulty.  The post change line revealed no pneumothorax.

On [**2146-11-26**], he had the onset of abdominal discomfort with
tachycardia, tachypnea with fluid overload.  The KUB showed
dilated small bowel.  The EKG was without acute changes.  The
hematocrit dropped and he required transfusion.
Gastrointestinal Department was consulted concerning a
gastrointestinal bleed.  He underwent upper and lower
endoscopy without any evidence of bleeding or ischemic bowel
changes or gastroduodenal ulcerations or bleeding.  He was
required to be re-intubated.  He was transfused and serial
CK-MB were obtained, which were flat.  The EKG were without
acute ischemic changes.

The patient's BUN and creatinine bumped to 3.8.  He went into
acute renal failure.  Renal service was consulted.  He was
begun on TPN.  Nasogastric tube feed was placed on tube
feedings.  Renal continued to follow the patient and by
[**2146-11-22**] the creatinine was back a baseline.  He was
diuresing adequately.

On [**2146-12-5**], postoperative day #13, the patient had an
elevated temperature.  He continued to remain intubated.
Bronchoscopy was done, which showed a left lower lobe and
right upper lobe pneumonia.  Cultures were obtained both of
blood, sputum, and C. difficile.  The C. difficile was
negative.  Blood cultures revealed no growth.  Sputum grew
gram-negative rods, which were consistent with Klebsiella.
He was started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl empirically.  He
was continued on this for a full 14-day course

On [**2146-12-7**], the ET tube was changed with bronchoscopy.
TPN was discontinued on the 29th.  He was continued on his
tube feeds.

On postoperative day #19, date [**2146-12-11**], the patient was
noted to be confused and somnolent.  Head CT was obtained,
which was initially read as negative, but, after further
review it was determined that the patient had an intracranial
bleed.  He remained intubated.  He was finally extubated on
[**2146-12-14**] and transferred to the VICU on [**2146-12-15**].  He
extubated NG tube on [**2146-12-14**].  The Department of
Otolaryngology was requested to see the patient regarding
assessment for aspiration.  He tolerated liquids well without
signs of aspiration.  Recommendations were to continue with
clear and full liquids and to monitor the patient for
aspiration, put the patient on aspiration precautions. The
patient was transferred to the regular nursing floor on
[**2146-12-17**].  He continued to progress.  The Department of
Otolaryngology Service saw the patient on [**2146-12-19**].  He had
no aspiration.  The diet could be advanced to pureed diet,
but no thick-thick foods, i.e. oatmeal or mash potato
consistency foods.  Coumadinization was restarted.  He was
begun on 7.5 mg.  This dosing was according to the PT INR
goal of 2.0 to 2.5 for chronic atrial fibrillation.

The patient was re-evaluated by the Department of Physical
Therapy.  They felt that he would require a short-term stay
in rehabilitation for ambulation and conditioning.  Case
management made referrals to the appropriate rehabilitation.
The patient was transferred to rehabilitation on [**2146-12-21**]
in stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin dosing according to INR.  Goal is 2.0 to 2.5.
2.  Heparin subcutaneously 5000 units b.i.d.
3.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
4.  Nitropaste 2 inches q.6h to chest wall; hold for systolic
blood pressure of less than 100.
5.  Lopressor 125 mg q.6h.
6.  Norvasc 10 mg q.d.
7.  Clonidine patch 0.3 mcg q.Friday.
8.  Captopril 100 mg t.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm with repair.
2.  Abdominal hematoma secondary to low platelet count,
Heparinization and anticoagulation resolved.
3.  Blood loss transfused corrected.
4.  Klebsiella pneumonia treated.
5.  ATN secondary to hypotension.
6.  Shock liver, improving.
7.  HTN controlled.
8.  Mental status changes secondary to intracranial bleed,
resolved.





DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should followup with
Dr.  [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] post discharge from rehabilitation.  Primary
care physician can manage the Coumadinization for atrial
fibrillation.
