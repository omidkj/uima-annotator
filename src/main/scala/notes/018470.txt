Admission Date: [**2103-8-29**]        Discharge Date: [**2103-9-20**]

Date of Birth:  [**2103-8-29**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NB


HISTORY:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 47766**] was born with extremely low
birth weight, preterm male infant delivered by emergent
cesarean section after the mother had an eclamptic seizure.
Mother is a 43 year old G5, P3 now 4. EDC [**2103-12-13**]
with a gestational age at birth of 24 and 6/7 weeks. Mother
has a history of type 2 diabetes and chronic mild
hypertension. She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2103-8-23**] with new elevation in blood pressure and a headache with
concern for possible preeclampsia. She was treated with
magnesium sulfate and close monitoring with good improvement
of her blood pressure. PIH work up was unremarkable with only
mild elevation of LFTs. On the morning of delivery she became
severely hypertensive and then developed seizures requiring
immediate delivery with general anesthesia. The infant
emerged severely hypotonic with no respiratory effort and a
heart rate in the 80's. The baby responded with bag mask
ventilation and showed improvement in heart rate without much
movement. The infant was then intubated and transferred to
the NICU for further care. The infant demonstrated some
intermittent spontaneous breathing and some movement but
still was quite hypotonic.

Mother's prenatal screen: Blood type A positive, antibody
negative, HBSAG negative, rubella immune, RPR nonreactive,
GBS unknown.  The infant had Apgars of 4, 6 and 7 at 1, 5 and 10
minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Birth weight of 650 grams which is
15th percentile, length of 31 cm which is 20th percentile,
head circumference of 22 cm which is 15th percentile. HEENT
showed anterior fontanel soft and flat with normal facies and
fused eyelids. Neck supple. Skin ruddy pink with some
bruising present. RESPIRATORY: Breath sounds equal, clear
with good air entry. Orally intubated. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:
Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs. Well perfused. ABDOMEN: Soft,
slightly full with apparent bowel loops after bagging and a 3-
vessel cord. GENITOURINARY: Normal male. Testes not
descended. NEUROLOGIC: Tone overall decreased which improved
slightly with more reaction to touch over the first 2 hours
of life. Cord arterial blood gas was 7.06 pH and the CO2 was
76. The venous gas was 7.09 pH with CO2 of 68.  The infant's
initial blood gas in the NICU was 7.32, 35, 46 on high FIO2
with a map of 10.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY: The
infant was placed on high frequency ventilation and was given
2 doses of surfactant. The infant remained on high frequency
ventilation until [**2103-9-1**].  On the newborn day after
the second dose of surfactant the infant quickly weaned down
to very low ventilator setting on high frequency ventilation.
He was switched over to conventional ventilation on day of
life 3, [**2103-9-1**] and remained on low ventilator
settings at that time. He was started on caffeine on day of
life 6, [**2103-9-4**], at which time he still remained on
very low ventilator setting. His ventilator settings remained
low to moderate since that time with intermittent chest x-ray
showing areas of atelectasis and hyaline membrane disease. On
[**2103-9-19**], in the p.m. the infant had increasing
ventilator settings due to total lethargy and worsening blood
gases. The infant was changed over to high frequency
ventilation at 10:30 p.m. on [**2103-9-19**], due to
increased settings and poor blood gases. The infant at that
time is on high frequency ventilation with an amplitude of
36, a MAP of 15 and 70% FIO2 with capillary blood gas of
7.30, 42. The infant does not have an A line in at this time.
The infant did receive a single dose of bicarbonate earlier
this afternoon. Chest x-ray done this evening showed 7.5 ribs
expansion with some scattered areas of atelectasis in the
lung fields, ET tube in good placement. The caffeine had been
discontinued on [**2103-9-15**], due to the fact that the
ventilator settings were moderate at that time.

CARDIOVASCULAR: UAC and UVC were placed on the newborn day.
The UVC were discontinued due to bluing of the toes on the
right foot shortly after the UVC was inserted. The infant has
been hemodynamically stable and did not require any pressor
support and has not had a murmur audible until an
intermittent murmur was audible on day of life 15 which is
[**2103-9-13**]. Echocardiogram was done on [**2103-9-13**], which showed a small membranous VSD, PFO and a small
PDA with a left to right flow. The PDA was not treated. The
infant has remained hemodynamically stable with normal blood
pressures and heart rate.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: The infant was started on
parenteral nutrition on the newborn day. The infant remained
NPO until day of life 4 on [**2103-9-2**]. The infant was
started on trophic feedings at that time of breast milk. The
infant had a slow feeding advance and reached full enteral
feeding by [**2103-9-17**] at which time the caloric density
was concentrated to a maximum caloric density of breast milk
26 calorie per ounce at 150 ml per kg per day. The infant was
made NPO on [**2103-9-19**] due to abdominal distension,
bilious vomiting, and heme positive stools. A KUB was done at
that time which showed pneumatosis and dilated loops of
bowel. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 37079**] was placed to low continuous suction at
that time and serial KUB's have been followed. The KUB's
remain abnormal with fixed loops of bowel. The abdomen was
pink in the day earlier on [**2103-9-19**] and through the
course of overnight into [**2103-9-20**], the abdomen has
presented with some duskiness and tenderness and guarding.
There are no bowel sounds. The [**Last Name (un) 37079**] continues to drain
bilious secretions. Most recent weight of the infant is 799
grams and that was on [**2103-9-19**]. The infant also did
have hyperbilirubinemia in the first couple of weeks of life
and had a peak bilirubin level of 3.5/0.5 which was on day of
life 5. The infant received a total of 10 days of
phototherapy, the most recent bilirubin level being 3.1/0.3
on [**2103-9-16**].

HEMATOLOGY: The infant's blood type is O positive, DAT
negative. The infant has received numerous blood
transfusions, packed red blood cell transfusions. Hematocrit
at birth was 51.6, platelet count of 127. Most recent blood
transfusion was given on [**2103-9-19**] with a total of 20
ml per kg per day and the infant is just completing that
second aliquot of packed red blood cells at the time of
transfer. The hematocrit prior to transfusion was 35 with a
platelet count of 300. The infant had been started on iron
and vitamin E on [**2103-9-18**]. These have subsequently
been discontinued when the infant was made NPO. PT and PTT
were drawn on [**2103-9-19**]. The PT was 14, the PTT was
49.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were screened on
admission to the NICU. The white blood cell count at the time
of admission was 3.8 with 29 poly's and 0 bands. 24 hours
later the white count did increase and the ANC improved.
White count was 4.4 with 66 poly's and 6 bands. The infant
received a total of 7 days of ampicillin and gentamycin due
to the initial neutropenia and sepsis risk factors due to
prematurity and clinical status. The neutropenia did improve
and was gone by the CBC on [**2103-9-6**]. CBC and blood
culture were screened on [**2103-9-10**], day of life 12 due
to heme positive stool at that time and concerns for sepsis
with some lethargy and mildly increased ventilator setting.
The CBC at that time showed 16.4 whites with 48 poly's and 10
bands, 2 meta's and 1 myelo, RT ratio of 0.21. The infant was
started on vancomycin and gentamicin as a rule out sepsis. A
trach aspirate culture was sent on [**9-13**] which showed
gram positive cocci and gram positive rods. The antibiotics
were switched to oxacillin and gentamicin at that time from
the vancomycin and gentamycin and the infant continued on the
oxacillin and gentamycin until [**2103-9-19**] when the
infant was changed to vancomycin and gentamycin and
clindamycin. On [**2103-9-19**] in the a.m. when the infant
dev
