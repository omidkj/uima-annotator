Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Left-sided hemiplegia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a lovely 83-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for
adenocarcinoma of lung (dx in [**2107**], treated with surgery, chemo
and radiation), atypical meningioma (s/p R sided resection
5-years-ago), CLL (stage 0), and DVT/PE (on warfarin therapy)
who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 14076**] Hospital after acute
onset of left sided weakness while on a trip to Moheegan Sun.
Patient states that ever since she returned from [**State 108**] about 3
weeks ago, she has noticed increased weakness, apraxia (cannot
but button her shirt or put on socks), and confusion.  On day
prior to admission, patient went to CT with her husband and some
friends on a "senior trip."  While sitting at a lunch table
eating a bagel, patient started shaking and developed L-sided
weakness.  Patient reports that she never lost consciousness,
though dose endorse some confusion surrounding the episode.

Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 14077**] was taken to [**Hospital 14076**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 14078**], CT where MRI
showed hemorrhagic brain metastases.  She was admitted to their
ICU her anticoagulation was reversed; INR had trended down to
1.9 prior to transfer.  According to reports from [**Last Name (un) 14076**],
patient's mentation had improved overnight as well.  Hct and
Chem 10 normal at OSH, as per report.  Patient transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] as all of her care has been here thus far; also discussion
of possible palliative XRT to [**Doctor Last Name **].
.
ROS:  Patient endorses some confusion, left sided weakness.
Denies pain, though did have headache in ambulance during
transfer.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
dysuria, fevers, chills, or any other concerning signs or
symptoms.

-Left frontal meningioma.
-Peptic ulcer disease.
-Colonic adenoma.
-Goiter with hypothyroidism.
-Osteoporosis.
-Osteoarthritis.

-Status post cholecystectomy.
-Atrial fibrillation with bilateral DVTs and IVC filter.
-Cataract.
-History of URI.
-Pulmonary emboli ([**2110**])
-DVT in [**2107**]

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- 83-year-old female with a history of stage zero CLL, underwent
resection of an atypical left frontal meningioma in 04/[**2107**].  At
that time, she had a CT chest, which showed a 1.5 cm speculated
mass in her right upper lobe.
- She underwent a right upper lobectomy and esophageal cavernous
hemangioma resection with tracheal laceration repair on
[**2108-8-24**].  At that time, it was a T4 adenocarcinoma and all
lymph nodes were negative.
- In [**2109-10-3**], she had a right lower lobe nodule which was
increasing in size.  It was watched closely, and in [**11/2109**] it
once again was found to be increasing in size.
- On [**2109-12-27**], she underwent a wedge resection, which showed a
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, potentially
different from her first primary in the right lower lobe.  She
has continued to be followed since that time.
- She was started on Navelbine therapy at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on
[**2110-8-21**].  This was decreased to 25mg/m2 on her 5th cycle due to
Neutropenia.
- She had evidence of disease progression on a CT scan performed
[**2111-4-2**] so the Navelbine was stopped.
- She received radiation to a bony lesion from [**Date range (1) 14079**].  She
had improvement of the pain after this.
- She started on Alimta on [**2112-3-31**].  She had a CT scan on
[**2112-8-18**]
which showed progression.
- She was started on Gemcitabine alone on [**2112-9-1**] which was
stopped due to pulmonary toxicity.
- She was started on Taxotere alone on [**2112-11-10**] which she
continued while in [**State 108**].

STUDIES:
[**4-26**] CT Head:
1. New intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right frontal
lobe, presumably representing a hemorrhagic metastatic lesion.
2. Additional smaller hemorrhagic metastatic lesions throughout
the
supratentorial brain.
3. Extensive vasogenic edema throughout the cerebral
hemispheres, without
evidence for midline shift or herniation.
4. Large soft tissue mass within the subcutaneous tissues of the
left frontal vertex and soft tissue nodule adjecent to the left
parotid gland, similar to prior MRI.
