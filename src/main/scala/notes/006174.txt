MRI/MRA Brain [**4-11**]:
FINDINGS:
There are changes from a left temporal craniotomy for resection
of left
temporal lobe mass. There is hemorrhage in the operative bed,
which limits
evaluation for residual neoplasm. Recommend attention on
followup imaging.
The more posteriorly placed medial temporal lobe mass with
heterogeneous
enhancement and either exophytically bulging or extending into
the left
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is unchanged. There appears to be ependymal
enhancement within the left occipital temporal horns. Again
noted is an approximately 8 mm of midline shift to the right as
well as mild uncal herniation which is unchanged from the
preoperative imaging. There is extensive T2 hyperintensity in
the left temporal lobe extending to the inferior frontal lobe,
which could represent vasogenic edema or infiltrative neoplasm.
There is small amount of restricted diffusion along the
posterior margin of the operative cavity, which could represent
acute ischemia or cytotoxic edema from retraction. There is a
left frontal subgaleal postoperative collection.  Intracranial
flow voids are maintained. MRA demonstrates no stenosis or
aneurysm, the basilar artery is somewhat dimunitive, which may
be related to prominent PCOMS.
IMPRESSION:
Postoperative changes in the left temporal lobe. Due to presence
of T1
hyperintense material in the operative bed, evaluation for
residual neoplasm is limited. Recommend correlation with
followup study when the acute blood products resolve. Unchanged
left posterior medial temporal lobe heterogeneous mass. Small
amount of restricted diffusion along the posterior margin of the
operative cavity. Please see above.

CT Head [**4-10**]:
FINDINGS: Patient is status post left craniotomy and resection
of large left temporal mass. There is expected pneumocephalus
within the left hemisphere. Extensive areas of new hemorrhage
are seen within the left cerebral hemisphere (2, 21). Extensive
amounts of edema are similar in appearance (2, 18): There is
persistent shift of the normally midline structures by
approximately 6.5 mm. There is effacement of the left ambient
cistern, unchanged. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus. The
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle also demonstrates
mild effacement, similar to slightly worse when compared to
prior exam. There is an unchanged left temporal lobe mass
causing mass effect on the temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
IMPRESSION: Status post partial resection of left temporal lobe
mass.
Extensive areas of new hemorrhage, pneumocephalus and persistent
shift of the normally midline structures. Close followup is
recommended. Persistent
effacement of the left ambient cistern is similar in appearance.

MRI Head [**4-9**]:
FINDINGS: In the region of the left temporal lobe including the
hippocampus, there are two heterogeneously enhancing lesions
with thick rind of enhancing tissue surroudning necrotic areas
in the center corresponding to those described on the CT scan
done on the same day. There is intraventricular extension of
these lesions. The more anterior lesion (8:10) measures 33 mm
transverse x 23 mm AP x 23 mm CC. The second more posterior area
measures 21 mm transverse x 28 mm AP x 23 mm CC. The two lesions
closely approximate each other and may, in fact, represent
lobules of one large conglomerated lesion illdefined lesion. The
lesions are notable for moderate- sized surrounding area of
edema. The more posterior lesion displays signal characteristics
suggestive of retained blood products. Both lesions show an
irregular thick rim of enhancement on post- contrast images.
There is an approximately 8 mm right deviation of normal midline
anatomy as well as partial effacement of the left lateral
ventricle, associated with these lesions. There is also mild
subependymal enhancement and along the margins of the ventricle
on the left side. There is partial entrapment of th left
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. In addition, effacement of the left border of the
suprasellar cistern is consistent with associated left uncal
herniation. There is no evidence of tonsillar herniation. There
is no evidence of acute infarction. On post- contrastimages,
there is displacement of the adjacent vessels including the
middle cerebral arteries and venous structures. Otherwise, the
paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. Two heterogeneously enhancing Left temporal lobe lesions
involving the
hippocampus and intraventricular extension and resultant mass
effect as
detailed above. Diagnostic considerations include primary CNS
infiltrative
malignancy such as glioblastoma multiforme or less likely a
lymphoma, though metastatic disease is also in the differential
diagnosis.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 27673**] at ~5p.m. on
[**2160-4-9**], who indicated that the patient was en route to the
emergency room with anticipation of admission.
