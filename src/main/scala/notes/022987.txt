Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Empyema with bronchopleural fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Last Name (un) 72148**] window (open window thoracoplasty)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 2398**] [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old Caucasian male who had undergone
a right lower lobectomy at an outside institution for squamous
cell carcinoma of the lung diagnosed in [**2146-7-30**] (he
underwent a VATS right lower lobe lobectomy on
[**2147-2-13**] at an OSH), and developed a bronchopleural fistula and
subsequently an empyema. He had been treated with antibiotics,
specifically Voriconazole and Augmentin. He has a persist
empyema cavity in the inferior hemithorax on the right side.

Three weeks following his initial surgery, he underwent a repeat
VATS procedure. However, his fistula persisted and between early
[**2147-2-27**] and late [**2147-4-29**] the patient was admitted multiple
times for repeated unilateral chest tube placements. On [**2147-4-26**],
a fluid culture (obtained from drainage from his fistula site)
grew Aspergillus fumigatus, Strep viridans and coag negative
staph. He was started on Ceftriaxone and Voriconazole at that
time. A follow-up culture, obtained from the same drainage site
on [**2147-5-8**], grew Peptostreptococcus, prevotella and again
Aspergillus fumigatus. His Ceftriaxone was switched to Ertapenem
at that time, while he remained on Voriconazole. He was
discharged home on this regimen on [**2147-5-22**] and completed a 6
weeks course on [**2147-6-10**]. He continued treatment on Augmentin and
Voriconazole.

Patient experienced worsening dyspnea, worsening pleuritic chest
pain and had persistent greenish discharge from his fistula
site, so he was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. A
Clagget Window procedure was performed on [**2147-6-23**].

Physical Exam:
VS: T 95.8  HR: 97 SR  BP: 138/78 Sats: 94% RA
BS: 244/177/88
General: 69 year-old male in no apparent distress
HEENT: normocephalic, mucus membranes moist
Neck: supple no lymphadenopathy
Cardiac: RRR, normal S1,S2 no murmur/gallop or rub
GI: benign
Extr: warm trace edema
Wound: Right Chest Wall (Clagget Window) site clean, no odor or
discharge with some pink granulated tissue formation.
Neuro: non-focal

Pertinent Results:
CXR: [**2147-6-20**]:Changes of right lower lobectomy are seen, with
volume
loss and elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Some chronic
scarring is seen at the right lung base, with persistent
loculated air and fluid collection. Mild interstitial thickening
and edema are unchanged. Mild cardiomegaly persists.
[**2147-6-24**]: There is increased lucency at the right base extending
across the lower right chest wall, presumably post-surgical.
Again seen is some atelectasis and/or scarring at the right base
and some pleural thickening at the right apex. There is new
subcutaneous emphysema overlying the right neck. Allowing for
positioning, the mediastinum is grossly unchanged. Again seen is
some vertically oblique platelike increased density at left base
which may represent atelectasis and/or scarring, and minimal
blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Some scarring in the
left upper zone laterally is also noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on a Dilaudid PCA
post-operatively and was switched to PO Dilaudid 2 mg Q4 PRN
with adequate pain control. Home Lexa pro was resumed upon ICU
transfer.

CARDIOVASCULAR: Patient required Cardiology clearance for
surgery given prior coronary stenting; 2D echo showed EF 55%
with mild LV dysfunction. LDL 133, patient was started on
Lipitor this hospitalization. Given bilateral edema,
TSH/folate/Vitamin B12, and nutritional labs were ordered after
cardiac etiology was explored. Home ASA resumed.

PULMONARY: Patient did well post-operatively, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72148**] window
and thoracoplasty. Dressing changes were performed three times
daily. His oxygen saturation was monitored, nebs were provided.
He required only face mask with oxygen in the ICU, was extubated
successfully post-op.  His room air oxygen saturation was 93%.

FEN/GI: Patient was advanced to clears then tolerated diabetic
diet.

RENAL: No issues. His K+ required replacement.

ENDOCRINE: given history of adrenal insufficiency, patient began
Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV Q8 stress dosing, switched to 50 mg IV
Q8 post-operatively and one day later, resumed Medrol 24 mg PO
regimen per Endocrine. Tapering his dose based on his
clinical response should be continued as an outpatient with his
Rheumatologist. Endocrine recommended stopping Florinef and
restarting his Metformin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] upon discharge. He was
covered on insulin sliding scale while hospitalized for type 2
DM. BG has been between 88-244 during hospitalization.

ID: Per ID, patient encouraged to continue HAART medications for
HIV. Voriconazole was continued through hospitalization for
prior Aspergillus culture.  Voriconazole levels were
periodically monitored and his dose was adjusted as needed.
Augmentin was discontinued post-operatively per ID. ID will
notify the rehab with any dose changes once Voriconazole level
has returned.

Wound: Clagget window site very clean with slight pink
granulated tissue.  Approximated measurement is ~15 cm wide, 10
cm in length, and ~12 cm at it's deepest.
There are Three(3) main defects that need to be packed:
One (1) is superior posterior under the lung.
Second (2)is more medial and difficult to see. The trajectory of
the wound is to the anterior abdominal wall where the empyema
burrowed out.
Third (3) is below the rib at the inferior aspect of the wound
extending to the costophrenic angle - this part is the most
tender for him.
Approximated measurement is ~15 cm wide, 10 cm in length, and
~12 cm at it's deepest.
Wet-to very dry dressing three times a day for 1 week then twice
daily.  He required additional pain medication for dressing
change.

PPX: Heparin SQ TID and PPI

Disposition: He was seen by physical therapy. Continue
ambulation. He was discharged to  [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital1 8**]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 58445**] for Clagget Window dressing changes
