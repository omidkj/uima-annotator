History of Present Illness:
This is a 46 year old male with a history of alcohol abuse and
end stage liver disease who was admitted to the trauma serivce
on [**2156-10-23**] after falling down the stairs in his home and
suffering multiple fractures.

   The patient has received most of his liver care at [**Hospital **]
[**Hospital3 26522**] Center.  He was found unresponsive by his
girlfriend at 4AM on the morning of presentation.  He was
initially taken to [**Hospital 5450**] Medical center where his initial
vitals were BP 72/52, P 73, RR 16, O2 89% with mask ventilation.
 He was noted to be groaning with some occassional arm movement.
 He was intubated for airway protection. He was found to have
fractures of the C6, C7 left T1 transverse process.  Initial
head CT there was negative for acute intracranial process.  CT
abdomen and pelvis was negative for acute intraabdominal trauma.
 A right femoral line was placed for access.  Labs were notable
for urine toxicology positive for tylenol, benzodiazepines and
opiates.  Serum alcohol 162.  Urinalysis was negative.  Na 131,
K 5.0, Cl 95, HCO3 24, BUN 15, Cr 1.3, Glu 96, Ca 8.7, T Bili
16.8, DBili 8.2, ALT 29, AST 60, INR 1.7, WBC 7.24, Hct 32.7,
Plts 71.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal
intervals, no acute ST segment changes, no change for prior.  He
was transferred here for further management.

   On arrival to our emergency room, initial vs were: T: 96.4 P:
75 BP: 117/73 R: 14 O2 sat 100% on ventilator.  Further imaging
demonstrated multiple rib fractures and fractures of C6-T3
transverse processes. Repeat CT head showed a new right frontal
subcortical parenchymal hemorrhage with blood-fluid level, He
received two units of FFP and two units of PRBCs and was
admitted to the trauma ICU for further management.

Past Medical History:
-End stage liver disease [**1-11**] alcohol. He has not been followed
by hepatology for 6 months. He has had ascites in the past as
well as a history of encephalopathy. No history of GI bleeding.
Recently drinking a few beers every few days.
-Peripheral vascular disease with recent toe ulcer on bactrim.
-Scheduled bilateral stent placement for this week.
-Pancreatitis
-s/p appendectomy

Social History:
Lives with girlfriend. 0.25 ppd x 20 years tobacco use. Still
drinking; heavy EtoH in past. Not working. Continuing drinking
and no follow-up in recent months despite ESLD.

CXR [**2156-10-23**]:  Appropriately positioned endotracheal tube.
Multiple left rib fractures, no pneumothorax.
CXR [**2156-11-6**]: Background pulmonary edema with mild interval
improvement in the right mid and left lower zone consolidations.


CT Chest w/o contrast [**2156-10-23**]:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions with underlying
consolidation/ atelectasis. 2. Left posterior rib fractures 3,
6, and 10. Left lateral rib fractures 3 through 8. 3. Left
transverse process fractures at T1, T2, and T3. 4. NG tube
terminates in the proximal stomach, just below the GE junction.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis w/o contrast [**2156-10-23**]:
1. No traumatic injury to the abdomen or pelvis. No intra- or
retro-peritoneal bleed. 2. Cirrhosis and evidence of portal
hypertension. No ascites. 3. Cholelithiasis. 4. Intra- and
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. 5. Diverticulosis. No
evidence of diverticulitis.

CT head w/o contrast [**2156-10-23**]:
New right frontal subcortical parenchymal hemorrhage with
blood-fluid level, which, if occurs at time of presentation,
suggests either anti-coagulation or intrinsic coagulopathy. Also
new is a subgaleal hematoma over the left parietovertex.

CT head w/o contrast [**2156-10-24**]:
Again demonstrated is asymmetric prominence of the extra-axial
CSF space overlying the left fronto-parietal convexity. This
measures 12 mm in maximal thickness from the inner table of the
skull (2:28) and 15 [**Doctor Last Name **] in density, and is unchanged over the
series of three studies, and may simply represent asymmetric
cortical atrophy; a subdural hygroma is not excluded (is there a
history of previous trauma?).

CT head w/o contrast [**2156-10-25**]:
Essentially unchanged size and appearance of right frontal IPH.
No new ICH. No developing hydrocephalus.

CT head w/o contrast [**2156-10-29**]:
1. Inferior right frontal parenchymal hematoma with
peri-hemorrhagic edema, unchanged.
2. No new foci of hemorrhage.
3. No fracture.

EKG: normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, borderline prolonged QTc
464, no acute ST segment changes, no change from prior dated
[**2156-10-23**].

[**2156-10-26**] RUQ U/S: 1. Irregular nodular liver with a coarse
echotexture in keeping with known liver cirrhosis. 2. The portal
vein and hepatic veins are patent; however, there is hepatofugal
flow in the main portal vein. There is reversed flow also in the
splenic vein which would be consistent with the presence of a
splenorenal shunt. There is a small amount of ascites and a
small right-sided pleural effusion. 3. Single gallstone in the
neck of the gallbladder, with a normal gallbladder wall. Two
sub-5-mm gallbladder polyps also identified.

[**10-26**] CT Head:  Unchanged appearance and size of right frontal
lobe
intraparenchymal hematoma, 2.4x2.0cm. No change since the prior
study.
While this can be related to trauma, an underlying vascular
lesion /mass
cannot be excluded and further cworkup can be considered, as
clinically
indicated.

[**11-1**] Abdominal US:  Scan trace of ascites in the perihepatic
space.

[**11-11**] CT Sinus:  N
