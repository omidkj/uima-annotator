fatigue.

The patient presented to her PCP on the [**2194-1-9**]
complaining of two days of rhinorrhea, cough with yellow
sputum, right sided pleuritic chest pain, and reported fever
and chills.  Given her normal physical exam, she was treated
for a bilateral upper respiratory infection with symptomatic
treatment.  However, the patient's symptoms persisted and she
presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department on the [**2194-1-13**] complaining
of increased weakness, right sided lateral chest pain,

abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bright red blood
per rectum, dysuria, vaginal discharge, and lower extremity
edema.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was treated with

pneumonia/sepsis and central line was placed.

2. Anxiety disorder.
3. Nephrolithiasis.
4. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5. Pyelonephritis [**2193-9-30**].
6. Hypertension.
7. COPD.

ALLERGIES:  Patient is allergic to codeine which causes chest
pain, and to Macrobid (nitrofurantoin/nitrofuran), which
causes fever, chills, arthralgias, and arthritis.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 50 q.d.
2. Aspirin 325 q.d.
3. Lipitor 5 q.d.
4. Xanax prn.
5. Aleve/Naproxen prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco and alcohol use.
She lives by herself in an apartment above her children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes, coronary artery disease, cancer of
the stomach and lungs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 95.3, pulse
62, blood pressure 79/48, O2 saturation 95% on room air.  In
general, this is a well appearing, cooperative, elderly
female.  HEENT:  PERRL.  Anicteric sclerae.  Oropharynx:
Moderate pupils dry, but clear.  Neck is supple without
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, regular, rate, and
rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:  Rhonchi and
wheezing on the right side.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  Back without CVA
tenderness.  Extremities without edema.  Pulses 1+, no rash.
Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves
II through XII intact.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 17.4, hematocrit 31.9,
platelet count 198.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.7, chloride 99,
bicarb 20, BUN 22, creatinine 1.2, glucose 281.  Lactate was
6.7.

Chest x-ray showed right middle lobe consolidation consistent
with pneumonia.

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE:  Given her picture of sepsis, the
patient was enrolled in the sepsis protocol and admitted to
the Medical ICU for treatment of her pneumonia.
1. Pneumonia:  The patient was diagnosed with community
acquired pneumonia and treated with levofloxacin and
ceftriaxone.  This led to a rapid improvement in her lung
examination with resolution of the rhonchi and wheezing
within 48 hours.  The patient continued to complain of
pleuritic type chest pain, for which she was treated very
gently with Tylenol and Motrin unsuccessfully, and then
successfully with Darvocet (codeine was avoided because the
patient is allergic).
2. Hypertension/sepsis:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia.
In addition to her antibiotic treatment, the patient was
aggressively hydrated according to the sepsis protocol.  This
resulted in an improvement in her blood pressure.  At the
same time, her antihypertensive medications were held.
3. Hyperglycemia:  During hospitalization, the patient's
glucose was found to be elevated.  The patient reports no
history of diabetes.  Obviously given her acute illness, the
diagnosis of glucose intolerance cannot be made at this time.
However, the patient was found to have a hemoglobin A1C of
6.3, indicating possibly glucose intolerance.  It is
recommended that the patient follows up with her PCP to
evaluate this finding.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for 10 days.
2. Cefpodoxime proxetil 200 mg b.i.d. for 10 days.
3. Acetaminophen 325 mg 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. prn.
4. Docusate sodium 100 mg b.i.d.
5. Lipitor 5 mg q.d.
6. Dextromethorphan guaifenesin 10/100 mg/5 mL syrup take
every six hours as needed.
7. Atrovent inhalers and Albuterol inhalers.
8. Darvocet one tablet p.o. q.6h. for seven days.
9. Atenolol 50 mg one tablet p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was advised to followup
with her PCP within one week (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], phone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1144**].  Also she was advised to contact her PCP or
come back to the Emergency Department if she continues to
have fever, chills do not resolve or if she experiences any
nausea and vomiting.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Pneumonia.
2. Sepsis.
3. Hypertension.
4. Possible glucose intolerance.

As of [**2194-1-15**], the patient is still in the Medical
ICU, but expected to be discharged on the following day to
home.  At this time, sputum cultures and blood cultures are
pending.  An addendum will follow.
