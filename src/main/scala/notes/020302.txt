Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis, Endocarditis, Pneumonia, Breast Mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
74 y/o F w/ PMH: CAD, CHF, COPD, PNA, presented to OSH on [**10-23**]
w/ fevers, chills, dysuria, flank back pain x 3 days.  Diagnosed
with pyelonephritis, received ampicillin/gentimicin +
ciprofloxacin + rocephin.  Blood Cx were positive for GPC (later
identified as MRSA), Pt was switched to vacomycin + gentamicin.
Fever went to 105.3, Pt became hypotensive 80/20, had ST
elevations on ECG.  INR was 3.8, Pt received 5 mg vitamin K.
Sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
CAD (anterior-inferior defects noted on previous stress tests),
s/p STEMI on [**2179-10-24**].  Plans for cardiac intervention during
recent hospitalization were deferred due to sepsis, hypotension,
and the discovery of high grade MRSA bacteremia. ECHO disclosed
EF 40-45%, and possible RV free wall depression.  Peak CK=580,
Trop 1.55. Patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**].

Staph aureus bacteremia, [**10-18**], complicated by mitral valve
endocarditis.   Patient started on Vancomycin [**2179-10-26**].  Source
of MRSA bacteremia not identified, although may have been
secondary to MRSA pneumonia (see below).

RUL multifocal pneumonia, associated with parapneumonic right
pleural effusion, noted on CT chest on [**2179-10-27**].  Attempts to
sample this fluid collection were unsuccessful due to its
relatively small size.

Right hilar lymphadenopathy (2.3 x 2.3 cm right hilar lymph
node) noted on [**10-27**] CT chest.

1.6 cm left breast mass

Left upper lip basal cell carcinoma

CHF (EF=40-45%, 1+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] [**2179-10-28**]),

COPD

Venous thromboembolism- PE. Patient takes Coumadin daily.

Hyperthyroidism

Hyperlipidemia

Obesity

Diverticulosis (noted on CT abdomen in [**10-18**])

[**2179-10-25**] TTE:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function appears depressed with distal septal, distal
anterior and
apical hypokinesis but views are technically suboptimal
(estimated ejection
fraction ?45%). Right ventricular free wall motion appears
depressed (but the
free wall was not fully visualized). There is a moderate resting
left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction without significant change
with Valsalva
maneuver. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated due to acoustic
shadowing). The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

[**2179-10-26**] CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY, FECES NEGATIVE FOR
C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA. Reference Range:  Negative.

[**2179-10-27**] CT CHEST:  1. Multifocal air space consolidation within
the right upper lobe likely represents multifocal pneumonia.
Lymphadenopathy seen within the chest is
likely reactive to this, with note made of a 2.3 cm right hilar
node. 2. Right-sided parapneumonic pleural effusion. 3. 1.6 cm
left breast mass. This is concerning for breast cancer. Further
evaluation with mammography and ultrasound is recommended 4.
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. 5. Diverticulosis without
diverticulitis

[**2179-10-28**] TTE:  The left atrium is dilated. No thrombus/mass is
seen in the body of the left atrium. The right atrium is
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF 40-45%) with septal
hypokinesis. Right
ventricular systolic function appears mildly depressed. There
are complex
(>4mm, non-mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch and the
descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened but
mobile. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
There is moderate to severe, focal mitral annular calcification
of the
posterior leaflet.There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
small,
slightly mobile mass (0.3mm x 0.5mm)) attached to the posterior
MAC consistent
with a vegetation. There is no obvious paravalvular abcess
cavity. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen (mitral regurgitaion may be
underestimated due to
acoustic shadowing). No vegetation/mass is seen on the tricupsid
or pulmonic
valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small mitral valve vegetation c/w endocarditis.
Moderate to severe focal mitral annular calcification. Mild
mitral regurgitation. No paravalvular abcess seen. Mildly
depressed LVEF with regional hypokinesis c/w CAD.

[**2179-10-29**] ECG:  Normal sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Q
waves in leads V1-V4 consistent with prior anterior myocardial
infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2179-10-26**] no diagnostic interval change


Brief Hospital Course:
SEPSIS/ENDOCARDITIS/PNA:  Post antibiotic blood (bacterial and
fungal) + urine cultures were all no growth to date at the time
of discharge.  TTE demonstrated small mitral valve vegetation
c/w endocarditis. Moderate to severe focal mitral annular
calcification. Mild mitral regurgitation. No paravalvular abcess
seen. Mildly depressed LVEF with regional hypokinesis c/w CAD.
