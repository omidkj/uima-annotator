Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo [**Month/Day/Year 595**] speaking female who is being transferred from the
ICU after presenting there with MS changes secondary to
hypoglycemia in the setting of her glyburide.

1. MS changes - she experienced these changes most likely due re
expression of prior stroke in the setting of hypoglycemia given
Neuro exam unremarkable, and head CT was unchanged. She was seen
by the Neurology team who thought this was from hypoglycemia,
and once her sugars improved back to baseline, her MS improved
back to baseline as well.

2. Hypoglycemia - likely secondary to glyburide in hemodiaylsis
patient as glyburide is contraindicated for patients with a
Creat clearance of less than 40. during her hospital course, her
fingerstick remained in the low 100s and so we decided to hold
off on all oral hypoglycemiscs and cover her with regular
sliding scale insulin. Please see attached sheet in d/c
paperwork for details of covering for insulin.

3. Anemia - she most likely has anemia secondary to anemia of
chronic disease given renal failure. She was transfused with 2u
PRBC and her HCT remained stable during the rest of the hospital
course.

4. Renal - she has known ESRD and is currently on hemodialysis
on Tu, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat. Had tunneled catheter placed in the OR on
[**2120-1-15**] and it was used for dialysis during her Tuesday
session.

5. Cardiology - she has significant cardiac history but no
active issues at this time. We decided to continue on all her
outpatient regimen. Also has history of atrial fibrillation for
which we are rate controlling and holding off of anticoagulation
given history of GI bleed

6. ID - she had some leukocytosis and diarrhea and was found to
be C Diff positive. She is being treated with Flagyl 500mg po
bid for a total of 2 weeks from discharge.
