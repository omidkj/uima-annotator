Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for renal failure in setting of heart failure.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left internal jugular central venous line placement.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo gentleman well known to the CCU team
following an admission [**Date range (1) 104276**], at which time he was diagnosed
with amyloid involving his heart and kidney.  He is now
presenting with acute on chronic renal failure, hypotension, and
volume overload.

His recent admission was notable for ongoing difficulties with
hypotension in the setting of significant volume overload.
Work-up demonstrated evidence of an infiltrative process in his
heart, and fat pad biopsy was consistent with amyloid.  He also
underwent heart catheterization, which demonstrated
inappropriately low systemic vascular resistance, and he was
felt to have autonomic dysfunction resulting in inappropriate
vasodilation.  In addition, he was seen by hematology/oncology
who were concerned that he likely has a plasma cell dyscrasia
given the monoclonal spike on his SPEP.  They recommended that
he be seen as an outpatient for possible bone marrow biopsy.
Finally, he was treated for C diff infection during his stay and
was discharged on a course of flagyl on [**2-12**].

At rehab today, his labwork revealed renal failure with Cr of
4.1 (up from 2.6 on discharge) and K+ of 5.3.  His blood
pressure was noted to be 64/42.  The patient was asymptomatic,
but the physicians at his rehab did not feel comfortable giving
him fluids for his renal failure in the setting of his volume
overload and heart failure.  He was therefore sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 96.7   50-70   75/47   22  Sat
not [**Location (un) 1131**].  Labs were significant for Cr of 4.2.  CXR showed
large b/l effusions (ED read).  He received vancomycin and zosyn
and was started on norepinephrine.  He was also given 1L of IVF.
 Per discussion with the CCU team, a central line was not
placed.

Upon arrival to the CCU, he stated that he had been eating
poorly at rehab.  His diarrhea has not returned.  He denied
chest pain.  Though he did not endorse shortness of breath, he
was asking for the face mask instead of the nasal prongs.  He
sleeps with his head propped up but he was unable to clarify if
he gets short of breath with lying flat.  In addition, he stated
there were times at rehab when he felt lightheaded.  He denies
fevers, cough, or dysuria.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools.  He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors.  He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year-old gentleman with diastolic
heart failure and chronic kidney disease in the setting of
recently diagnosed amyloidosis who presented with hypotension,
acute renal failure, and volume overload.

His hypotension was believed due to a combination of impaired
cardiac output from infiltrative cardiac amyloidosis, autonomic
dysfunction, and decreased effective circulating volume
secondary to amyloid infiltration of peripheral vasculature with
resulting capillary leak.

Initially a central line was placed and he was started on
vasopressin and norepinephrine. Fluid boluses were also given.
Midodrine was continued per outpatient regimen. However, his MAP
remained low despite these aggressive interventions. Urine
output, furthermore, decreased and on the first hospital day he
became anuric, likely from renal amyloidosis.

We spoke with the renal service about the possibility of CVVHD
for volume overload, but they said that this was not an option
given his hypotension. Given the lack of other treatment options
and the rapidly progressive nature of his disease, a
