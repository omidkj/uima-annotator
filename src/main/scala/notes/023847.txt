Chief Complaint:
allo SCT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 42 yo female with recent diagnosis of primary
myelofibrosis now admitted for an allogenic stem cell transplant
from a matched unrelated donor (her siblings were not a match)
per TBI and Cytoxan protocol.  Pt was diagnosed in [**10-10**], since
then requiring frequent transfusions for her persistent anemia.
She has also received Neulasta and Procit periodically.  She was
recently started on Danazol for her myelofibrosis ([**2118-12-23**]),
which was briefly held from [**Date range (1) **] due to periorbital
swelling. She was also started on Exjade on [**2119-1-13**] given her
frequent transfusions.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, pt is felling well.  States she is
hungry.  Tolerated the line placements well, denies pain.  Feels
a little lightheaded currently.  Of note, pt mentions that she
has been taking Prednisone (2 tab) daily, which has been
prescribed by her oncologist, stopped taking it 2 days ago.
.
ROS: As per HPI, otherwise negative. Denies fevers/chills, URI
symptoms, GI symptoms, dysuria.

Past Medical History:
Past Onc History: Patient first presented with profound fatigue,
nausea, and heavy vaginal bleeding [**10-10**], six weeks after
arriving from [**Country 651**].  She was found to be pancytopenic and had
peripheral blood smear showing extensive teardrop forms and
leukoerythroblastic smear (teardrop cells, nucleated RBCs,
immature WBCs) prompted bone marrow biopsy, which revealed
myelofibrosis.  Unclear etiology,
but may be secondary to post-polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]/essential
thrombocytosis myeloid metaplasia, and JAK-2 test was negative.
BCR-ABL translocation test was negative.  Flow cytometry
revealed subset of RBCs with CD55 deficiency, normal CD59.  35%
of granulocytes without CD55.  Monocytes without CD14.  Findings
raise the possibility of PNH, though not conclusive.
.
Infectious workup was negative, including negative CMV, EBV,
HIV, and parvovirus. CT showed splenomegaly without
lymphadenopathy. echo was performed and did not suggest any
pulmonary artery hypertension of systolic/diastolic dysfunction.
Hepatosplenomegaly, which was noted upon admission but became
less clinically obvious upon transfer to the BMT inpatient
floor, may have been due to extramedullary hematopoeisis.
Patient's white cells, red cells, and platelets were stable for
the remainder of the admission.
.
Other Past Medical History:
PMF
? PNH
Pneumonia
Difficult crossmatch due to antibodies

Social History:
She lives in [**Location 86**] with her husband and 13-year-old son.  She
immigrated from [**Country 651**] in [**2117**].  She is currently  unemployed.
She does not smoke, does not drink alcohol.  Her husband is also
unemployed, recovering from treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer.


Family History:
She has no history of hematologic malignancies.  She has a
brother and sister in [**Name (NI) 651**] who are alive and well.  Denies any
family history of leukemia, lymphoma, or cancers.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 42 yo female with recent diagnosis of primary
myelofibrosis now admitted for an allogenic SCT per TBI and
Cytoxan protocol.

# Myelofibrosis for allo SCT:  TBI/Cytoxan protocol was
followed. Pt initially had nausea/vomiting that then resolved.
Pt also had diarrhea (C diff was neg x 3). Pt tolerated SCT
well, had a fever that night which then resolved.  Patient
developed significant side effects from chemotherapy, including
severe mucositis requiring fentanyl PCA, and cardiomyopathy
likely from cytoxan (see below for details).  Cell counts
reached nadir on [**2-27**] with ANC of 0.  Resultant pancytopenia
from myelosuppression requiring multiple transfusions to kept
Hct > 21 and platelets > 10.  The patient had multiple
documented alloantibodies to blood products, in particular high
platelet reactive antibodies.  Despite extensive efforts by the
blood bank, matched platelets were unable to be located.  On
[**3-3**], patient developed significant consumptive reactions to
platelet transfusions which were later determined to be due to
antibodies. HLA C type platelets were ordered.
.
# Cardiopulmonary Collapse: Patient was acutely diaphoretic on
[**3-5**] with abdominal pain. Stat upright film revealed no free air.
She was bolused with fluids for falling pressures. Patient
became unresponsive, hypotensive to 50's, and desaturated. She
was moaning. She continued to protect her airway but was
AmbuBagged to augment ventillation. Her blood glucose was 16.
She briefly responded to D50 but continued to remain
hypotensive. Anesthesia was called, intubated the patient. Three
pressors were started, epinephrine given several times. She
bradied and responded to atropine. A massive transfusion was
initiated. Her family and BMT oncologist were called. Both
arrived, as did the chinese interpreter. Her family was brought
in to the code to say goodbye. The chinese interpreter helped
communicate the events of the evening. The time of death was 315
AM.
.
# Fever: Pt had fevers during the conditioning phase prior to
receiving SCT.  Pt was started on Vanc and Cefepime, after which
the fevers resolved.  IR evaluated pt's central lines and dental
eval was done as pt had recent dental procedures and complained
of a toothache.  Cultures were negative as well as CXR.  On [**3-2**],
patient again developed fever during platelet transfusion and
fluconazole was changed to micafungin.  Patient subsequently
complained of abdominal pain with intermittent vomiting.
Complete abdominal ultrasound showed splenomegaly but did not
reveal any acute pathology.  Intermittent fevers continued, and
the patient was started on flagyl due to concern for an
intrabdominal source.  Given severe mucositis, there was concern
for typhlitis, CT abdoman without contrast could not be
completed before patient had passed
.
# Anemia: Pt has persistent anemia from her disease. Pt has
multiple documented
alloantibodies which are clinically significant and may lead to
hemolytic transfusion reactions. Thus, carefully matched blood
had to be made available through the American Red Cross.  Given
this limitation, pt was transfused with a goal of Hct>21.
.
# Cardiomyopathy:  Prior to allogenic SCT, patient had an ECHO
showing EF of 45% (a decline from normal function several months
earlier).   On [**3-1**], patient was noted to have symptoms of acute
congestive heart failure, complaining of new orthopnea.  On
exam, she was noted to have elevated JVP, hyperdynamic PMI with
S3 and evidence of pulmonary edema.  Repeat ECHO, showed an
ejection fraction of 25-30% with global hypokinesis of left
ventricle.  EKG showed no evidence of acute ischemia and cardiac
enzymes were negative, and cardiomyopathy was attributed to high
dose cytoxan.  Cardiology was consulted and recommended volume
management with boluses of lasix prn and initiation of
carvedilol.  ACEI were contraindicated in the setting of
cyclosporine....
.
# Mucositis: Following Cytoxan and TBI, patient developed severe
mucositis with significant diarrhea and odynophagia.
Clostridium difficile toxins were negative x 3 and patient was
maintained on fluconazole for [**Female First Name (un) **] prophylaxis.  Later in
hospital course, when patient developed neutropenic fever, she
was fluconazole was switch to micafungin.   She was started on
Fentanyl PCA for pain control and TPN to maintain adequate
nutrition.  Also started on protonix, given risk of stress ulcer
prophylaxis.  On [**3-4**], patient developed severe
