IMPRESSION: Suggestion of right suprahilar or mediastinal
airspace process, likely pneumonia. Repeat radiography
recommended after appropriate therapy.

EKG:  Rate 85bpm.  Baseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm with
atrial sensed and ventricular paced rhythm but baseline artifact
makes assessment difficult. Since the previous tracing of
[**2152-9-25**] sinus rate is faster and there appears to be atrial
sensed and ventricular paced rhythm.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**],
chronic LE edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse
found her to be febrile.

# Legionella Pneumonia/sepsis: Patient had RUL infiltrate on CXR
with [**Year (4 digits) **] on admission and elevated white count. Due to low
blood pressure with SBP in the 80s at times, patient received an
arterial line yesterday and levophed, which was subsequently
weaned.  Urine culture data is positive for Legionella, and
patient was given levofloxacin which was started in the ED.
Blood cultures were negatvie to date.  Pt instructed to complete
14 day course of Levofloxacin as coverage for legionella.
.
# Enterococcus UTI:  Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria
with few WBC and negative Leuk esterase. Urine culture grew
>100k enterococcus. Patient was intitailly on vancomycin in the
ICU this was changed to ampacillin and the patient was
instructed to complete a 7 day course.  An attempt was made to
discontinue the patient's foley but she was unable to urinate
and had a significant amount of urinary retention.  An attempt
should be made to remove the patient's foley in a few days after
antibiotic course completed.
.
#Delirium:  Patient's mental status seemed to wax and wane at
times.  Was likely related to acute infection.  Electrolytes
were stable.  Patient did not require any pharmocologic
restraint.  TSH, free t4, RPR, b12, folate, pending.  The
patient reportedly has some baseline cognition issues at home
and is extremely heard of hearing.  Patient seen by geriatrics
consult team who agrred with our management and recommended
frequent reorientation
.
#Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with
EF=30% on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier **] in ED with unknown baseline.
Multiple CXR are inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient
did not complain of shortness of breath.  Stirct I/os were
monitored.  Before discharge the patient was restarted on her
beta blocker, ace inhibitor, and lasix.
.
# Left Leg Ulcer: Chronic issue. Appears superficial without
