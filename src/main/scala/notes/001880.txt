colectomy from C. diff colitis in [**2111**] that presented to the
emergency department complaining of shortness of breath over the
last several days which is getting worse.

He states that for the shortness of breath that this has

FINDINGS: There is evidence of emphysema, although no focal
consolidation is seen. There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is not significantly changed.
There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen. Aortic
calcifications are noted.

Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and a
ventricular
premature beat. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.
