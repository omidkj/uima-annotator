Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis, bright red blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
blood transfuions

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year-old female with coronary artery
disease, history of MI, end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension and known duodenal and gastric
antral ulcers transferred from the Emergency Department of
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for an upper GI bleed.  She was admitted [**10-7**]
- [**2111-10-10**] for an upper GI bleed.  On the day of this current
admission, she felt weak, had a non-bloody bowel movement, and
went to the [**Hospital1 1562**] ED where she developed massive melena and
hematochezia (1 liter).  She received packed red blood cells at
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital (conflicting reports of how many - mostly
likely 2) and was transferred via med flight to [**Hospital1 **] emergency department.

Pertinent Results:
On admission:
Hematocrit 28.0 (range 27.4 - 37.3)
WBC 10.6
INR 1.4
PTT 34.1
CK 29
Trop 0.06
Electrolytes K 5.2, Creatinine 6.7, UreaN 34, Glucose 174
(others WNL)
ABG 7.45/185/43/31

Angiography ([**10-16**])
No active contrast extravasation in the stomach or duodenum.
Occlusion of SMA and proximal portion of the splenic artery and
right hepatic artery.

CXR ([**10-16**])
The ET tube tip terminates in the origin of the right main
bronchus. The position was corrected and was demonstrated on the
subsequent chest radiographs from 4:00 a.m. in the morning. The
NG tube is coiled in the stomach with its tip most likely
terminating in the mid or distal position of the stomach, not
included on the field of view.
There is new left lower lobe opacity which may represent either
atelectasis or aspiration. No evidence of congestive heart
failure is present.

CXR ([**10-16**])
The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. At least one of
the mid sternal sutures is broken. The cardiac silhouette is
mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified. The right lung is
essentially clear. The linear opacities in the mid area of the
left lung most likely represent atelectasis. There is no sizable
right pleural effusion. A left pleural effusion cannot be
excluded due to the fact that the left costophrenic angle was
not included in the field of view.

EKG ([**10-16**]) normal sinus rhythm

CXR([**10-17**])
Endotracheal tube remains in standard position, but nasogastric
tube has been removed. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
appearance. Worsening opacity in the left retrocardiac region
probably represents a combination of atelectasis and effusion.
Right lung is grossly clear except for minimal discoid
atelectasis in the perihilar region.

Echocardiography:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
sizes and regional/global biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

CXR (PICC placement):
Interval improvement of aeration as noted above. The tip of the
right subclavian line is in the right subclavian vein and
requires advancement for standard positioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
*) GI bleed: The patient was intubated in the emergency
department for airway protection given hematemesis.  She had
been transfused with packed red blood cells at the outside
hospital (unclear number, likely 2) and on arrival her systolic
blood pressure was in the 70s with a hematocrit of 28.  She was
transfued 4 units of packed red blood cells in the [**Hospital1 18**]
emergency department with recovery of systolic blood pressure to
the 120s.  An initial EGD performed on [**10-16**] (night of admission)
showed clot throughout the stomach and the scope could not be
passed through the pylorus given that the clot covered the
channel.  An angiography demonstrated no active bleeding, as
well as occlusions in the superior mesenteric artery and splenic
artery, both which reconstituted.  The patient was admitted to
the surgical ICU.  A second look EGD demonstrated a 1cm ulcer
with a clean base in the antrum with evidence of recent bleeding
which was treated with bicap and 4cc of epinephrine.  Multiple
shallow ulcers in the duodenum were treated with bicap.  The
plan, given high estimated risk of rebleed, was for angiography
with attention to the left gastric artery.  The patient had
hematocrit checked every 8 hours.  Between [**10-16**] and [**10-18**], the
patient received a total of 12 units of packed red blood cells
and 3 units of platelets with hematocrit ranging between 27.4
and 37.3.  Since the last transfusion, her hematocrit has been
stable between 27.4 and 31.0.  Once she was taking clears, the
patient was started on treatment for H. pylori: proton pump
inhibitor (to be taken indefinitely), clarithromycin and
amoxicillin (renally dosed - to be taken for a total of 2
weeks).  The patient was extubated on [**10-17**] and did well from a
respiratory standpoint for the rest of her admission.  She was
transfered from the intensive care unit to the floor on the
evening of [**10-20**].  Her hematocrit remained stable, as did her
vital signs for the rest of her admission.

*) End stage renal disease: the patient was dialyzed on [**9-24**], [**10-20**], [**10-21**], [**10-23**].

*) FEN: The patient was advanced to sips then clears on [**10-20**], to
full liquids on [**10-21**] and then to a regular, soft, diabetic diet
on [**10-22**] which she tolerated well.  She did complain of some
loose/watery bowel movements on [**10-21**] that were light-medium
brown with no blood.  Stool was sent for C. difficile assay.
The diarrhea resolved on the night of [**10-21**].

On dishcharge on hospital day #9, the patient's vital signs were
stable, she was afebrile and she was able to tolerate a regular
diet and ambulate well.  She will follow up with her regular
gastroenterologist and is aware that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is available
should she have any problems or questions.
