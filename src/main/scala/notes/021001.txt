Service: MEDICINE

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Heart palpitations and dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Intubation
Right PICC Line placement
Arterial Line


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 30yo male with a known history of Hodgkins
Lymphoma and recent diagnosis of mesothelioma now undergoing
chemotherapy with cisplatin and alimta, last dosed 2 weeks ago.
Since that session has been experiencing general malaise, poor
appetite, weight loss. Now 103lbs down from 135 lbs prior to
chemotherapy. Had been tolerating chemo reasonably well until
day prior to admission when he began having anxiety attacks most
of the night. Heart rate had been fast and pounding. Later on
night prior to admission felt acutely dizzy around 1AM in the
setting of acute anxiety. Was unable to get up from bathroom
floor. Took his pulse and noted it to be rapid and so activated
EMS. On arrival, was reportedly a narrow complex tachycardia at
200bpm. Resolved with valsalva maneuvers in ambulance. Second
episode of SVT at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3075**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3549**] Hospital at 3aM and again at
4:30am. Second and third episode required IV adenosine for
termination.
.
At [**Hospital6 1109**] patient had SVT that was terminated
with adenosine 6mg IV x2 and metoprolol 5mg IV x1. The patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were BP 118/92, RR 16, O2 99% on 2L
NC. The patient's exam was notable for bilateral wheezing and
the patient was pale and ill-appearing. Mr. [**Known lastname **] initial EKG
was sinus tachycardia with a shortened  PR interval and a rate
of 104 with no ischemic ST changes noted. The patient had an
episode of SVT in the ED which abated after vagal
maneuvers/carotid massage and Adenosine 6mg IV x1. The patient
was also given a dose of Levaquin for suspected infection. TTE
Echo was performed which showed no evidence of pericardial
tamponade, pulsus measured between 6-8mmHg on 2 occasions.
Cardiology was consulted who felt dyspnea was likely non-cardiac
but that patient would benefit from admission to CCU for
management of SVT.
.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke,
TIAs, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, abnormal
bleeding with prior surgeries, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black or bloody stools. He mentioned occasional
constipation but denied diarrhea. He denied recent fevers,
chills or rigors. No new or changing lymphadenopathy. All other
review of systems negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, or syncope
although patient stated he had some sensations of dizziness
while enduring his above mentioned SVT episodes.

[**2138-9-20**]  Admission EKG: EKG showed sinus tachycardia with normal
axis, normal intervals, no hypertrophy, no delta wave, small
q-wave in III, PR depression in I, II and J-point elevation in
V1, V2. no TWI's or ST elevations.
.
[**2138-9-20**] TELEMETRY: Sinus tachycardia on arrival to CCU
.
[**2138-9-20**] TTE 2D-[**Month/Day/Year **]: EF 50-55%, trivial pericardial
effusion, moderate TR, mild pulm HTN, no tamponade.

[**2138-9-20**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS:
No evidence of pulmonary embolism, Left lower lobe airspace
disease with air bronchograms consistent with pneumonia,
Bilateral loculated pleural effusions, Marked left-sided pleural
thickening and a large loculated left
subpulmonic effusion. This could represent the patient's
mesothelioma.
Increased bronchovascular soft tissue density, particularly in
the left
hilum, is most likely related to the patient's previous
radiation. No gross
evidence of airway obstruction. A separate hilar mass is felt to
be less
likely, but correlation with previous outside studies would be
useful.  Given the patient's history, follow-up evaluation in
[**2-20**] months to document stability is advised. 1.8 x 1.5 cm
enhancing lesion in the left lower lobe of the liver.
Differential diagnosis includes focal nodular hyperplasia,
adenoma, or a flash filling hemangioma.
