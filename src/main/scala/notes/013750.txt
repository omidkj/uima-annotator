Head CT scan [**2139-7-21**]
FINDINGS: There is no acute intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage,
edema, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures, or acute major
vascular
territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are prominent,
compatible
with age-related atrophy. There is extensive periventricular
white matter low
attenuation, compatible with chronic small-vessel ischemic
disease. Visualized
paranasal sinuses reveal mild mucosal thickening of the right
maxillary sinus.
Osseous structures reveal no evidence of a fracture. There is
extensive
calcification of the carotid arteries bilaterally in its
cavernous portions.

Motion slightly limits evaluation.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Extensive chronic
small-vessel
ischemic disease.

CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis [**2139-7-21**]

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Coronary artery
calcifications are seen.
There is a small amount of pericardial fluid. Otherwise, the
heart is
unremarkable. There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the
thoracic aorta.
No pathologic mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is
identified.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, with
associated atelectasis on the left side. The lungs otherwise are
grossly
clear without focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Non-contrast liver
demonstrates tiny
calcific densities, likely reflecting calcified granulomas. The
spleen and
right adrenal gland are unremarkable. Both kidneys demonstrate
rounded
hypodensities, incompletely characterized without IV contrast.
Within the
left adrenal gland, there is a 10-mm nodule, unchanged from
[**2138-8-11**], of indeterminant etiology.

The stomach, small bowel, and colon are unremarkable. Again
noted is a
spigelian hernia on the right containing a loop of large bowel.
There is no
free fluid, free air, or pathologic adenopathy. The pancreas is
fatty
infiltrated and atrophic.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Foley catheter is present
within the
urinary bladder. The rectum is unremarkable. There is no pelvic
free fluid
or adenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:
1. There are fracture deformities of nearly every rib
anterolaterally, some
with bridging callus, and some without, suggesting that these
are of varying
ages of healing.

2. There is a comminuted fracture of the right inferior and
superior pubic
rami. There is a nondisplaced fracture of the left sacral ala,
at the level
of the promontory. The exact extent of this is difficult to
assess secondary
to diffuse osteopenia.

3. There is buckling of the medial acetabulum on the right,
suggesting a
nondisplaced fracture/buckling.

4. There are chronic compression deformities of L3 and L4,
similar in
appearance to [**2138-8-11**].

5. There is an obliquely oriented fracture of the T10 vertebral
body,
extending from the mid portion of the intervertebral body wall,
to the
junction of the inferior endplate and posterior wall, involving
both anterior
middle columns, with distraction of the fracture fragments. This
is an
unstable fracture.

6. There is a compression deformity of the T3 vertebral body, of

indeterminant age.

7. There is ankylosing of the long segment of the thoracic
vertebral bodies.

IMPRESSION:
1. Obliquely oriented fracture of the T10 vertebral body,
involving both
anterior middle columns, which is an unstable fracture.

2. Multiple pelvic fractures, including right superior and
inferior pubic
rami, left sacral ala, and possibly the medial acetabulum on the
right.

3. Numerous rib fractures bilaterally, of varying ages of
healing.

4. Compression deformities of the L3, L4, and T3 vertebral
bodies. The L3
and L4 are similar in appearance to [**2138-8-11**]. The T3
compression
deformity is of indeterminant age.

5. Left adrenal nodule, stable from [**2138-8-11**]. However,
this is of
indeterminant etiology, and if clinically indicated, MRI may be
obtained for
further characterization.

CT Thoracic Spine [**2139-7-22**]

FINDINGS: Distracted fracture of T10 vertebral body is
redemonstrated. The
fracture remains obliquely oriented, extending from the mid
portion of the
anterior vertebral body to the junction of the inferior endplate
and posterior
wall. As previously indicated, the fracture involves both the
anterior and
middle columns.

There is approximately 14 mm of distraction in the craniocaudal
dimension,
greatest anteriorly. There is a moderate amount of dense
material, best seen
on axial images (3, 61), centered within this fracture, most
consistent with
hematoma. There is no retropulsion of bony fragments. Visualized
outline of
the thecal sac appears unremarkable, but please note that CT is
unable to
provide intrathecal or ligamentous detail comparable to MRI.

Diffuse osteopenia limits sensitivity for additional
nondisplaced fractures.
There is slight compression deformity of T3 vertebral body, with
roughly 25%
loss of vertebral body height. Diffuse longitudinal ankylosis of
the
visualized spine is unchanged.

Incidental note made of small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
effusions, left
greater than right. Pacemaker wires are seen in place. There is
moderate
three-vessel coronary artery calcification, and diffuse
atherosclerotic
calcification of the aorta.

IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of T10 vertebral body distracted
fracture, which as
previously indicated involves both the anterior and middle
columns, and is
unstable.
2. Slight compression deformity of T3, with roughly 25% loss of
vertebral
body height.
3. Unchanged diffuse longitudinal ankylosis of the thoracic
spine.
4. Small bila
