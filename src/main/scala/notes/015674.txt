Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Low Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
open spinal biopsy


History of Present Illness:
77 year old Male s/p L ureteral stent removal [**5-18**], s/p foley
removal & then replaced after failing voiding trial, who
presents with 10/10 sharp back pain radiating to lower abdomen
since yesterday. He also notes a 30lb weight loss since [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2175**].

In the ED, a Foley was placed with 400cc UOP. UA was positive.
CT abd/pelvis without contrast (Cr 1.9) showed new left
hydroureteronpehrosis, also spinal/pelvic lytic lesions
consistent for prostate cancer vs. myeloma. Urology was
consulted in the ED and noted that some hydroureter is expected
s/p stent removal, and he has had positive urinalysis before.

On the floor, he was not in pain as long as he lay still in the
bed but would have occasional bursts of excrutiating lower back
pain that spontaneously resolved within a second or two with
cough or movement, almost bringing him to tears. He reports that
he has had this pain for the past 3 days. He denied SOB, F/C,
pain other than his back pain. He reports decreased appetite
recently and increasing fatigue.

The patient had a recent admission for acute on chronic renal
failure, recurrent hematuria, and abdominal pain during which he
developed lower back pain. At that time he was started on
Flexeril which reportedly seemed to help.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2175-5-20**] 6:17 AM
IMPRESSION: Limited study for purposes of PICC line placement,
reveals left PICC line terminating at the cavoatrial junction.
Recommend repeat film for further evaluation of interstitium.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2175-5-20**] 12:22 AM
1. New left moderate hydroureteronephrosis, with no obstructing
stone
visualized.
2. Multiple new lytic circular lesions within the
pelvis and spine highly concerning for malignancy, notably
myeloma.
This finding was placed in the Radiology critical result queue
for direct communication to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
3. No aneurysm or evidence of leak. Lack of IV contrast limits
evaluation for dissection or penetrating ulcer.
.
EKG [**2175-5-20**]: Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V block. Otherwise, no
other significant diagnostic abnormality. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2175-5-2**] there is no significant diagnostic
change.
.
[**2175-5-21**]: CT spine
IMPRESSION: Multiple lytic lesions seen throughout the cervical
spine compatible with metastasis.
.
[**2175-5-21**] MRI SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple lesions throughout the spine, particularly in the
thoracic and lumbar spines, may be consistent with multiple
myeloma or metastases.
2. Complete myelomatous or metastatic replacement of the T8
vertebral body with compression fracture and epidural
involvement at this level which encases the spinal cord, without
evidence of compression.
3. Mild superior endplate compression at L3.
.
[**2175-5-22**] echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%)
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**5-24**] LE doppler:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.
.
urine [**2175-5-26**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
NO UROTHELIAL CELLS SEEN.
.
[**5-25**] T spine BX:TECHNIQUE: After obtaining informed consent, the
patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology suite
and placed in the biplane table in the prone position. A
preprocedure timeout was performed using two patient
identifiers. Moderate sedation was utilized with 200 mcg of
fentanyl and 4 mg of Versed administered in divided doses
throughout the 1 hour and 20 minute intraservice time during
which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continouously
monitored. The lower back was prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. Using AP and lateral fluoroscopic technique,
the L4 vertebral body was localized at the site for tissue
sampling. This was also after reviewing prior MRIs and CT scans.
Initially, two 22-gauge spinal needles were placed in the region
of the right and left pedicles of the L4 vertebral bodies.
Position and orientation of the needles were confirmed with
dynamic CT scan on the fluoroscopic table. After orientation was
confirmed two 11-gauge needles were placed along the orientation
of the spinal needles into the pedicle of the L4 vertebral body.
Using the dynamic CT scan, the positions of the needles were
confirmed to be within the vertebral body and in the location of
the lesions. Using 22-gauge Franseen needles which were advanced
over the trocar several samples through both pedicles into the
vertebral body were obtained. In addition, using [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 16095**]
needle, a core tissue sample was obtained through the left
pedicle. At this point, the needles and trocars were removed and
the procedure was terminated. The patient tolerated the
procedure well without immediate complications. Samples were
sent to pathology for additional testing.
