Chief Complaint:
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement, mitral valve replacement

History of Present Illness:
This 69 year old male with a history of shortness of breath was
investigated and found to have severe aortic stenosis and severe
mitral regurgitation with reasonably preserved left ventricular
function in place of severe regurgitation. The coronary arteries
were normal on angiogram. The medical history was significant
for alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver, class B Childs
classification. After much discussion with the family and the
patient, they wished to proceed with high risk double valve
replacement.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac surgery service and
underwent mitral and aortic valve repair on [**2143-7-16**]. The
patient's postoperative course was, as predicted, complicated.
He failed to wean off the ventilator, resulting in an open
tracheostomy procedure on [**2143-7-23**], subsequent DIC, and renal
failure requiring CVVH. His course was further complicated by GI
bleeding, resulting in exploratory laparotomy on [**2143-7-28**],
negative for ischemic colitis. Gastric/jejunostomy feeding tubes
were placed. The patient developed infection with Pseudomonas at
multiple sites. Ultimately, the patient's liver failed.
Transplant surgery was consulted, but there was no hope for
recovery of his liver function, nor was the patient suitable for
a transplant. The family, after several days of deliberation and
discussion with the attending surgeon and housestaff, decided to
withdraw supportive care, and Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2143-8-6**].
