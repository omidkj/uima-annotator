Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
subdural hematoma, s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 yo female with afib on coumadin, HT, CHF, history
of C.diff, who presents s/p fall at home. Per her granddaughter,
who lives upstairs, she heard a thud and found her grandmother
had fallen and hit her head, no apparent LOC. She was taken to
an OSH, where head CT showed bilateral subdural hematoms. Her
C-spine was cleared, and EKG was reportedly normal. She received
2 units of FFP, 10mg of IV vitamin K, and 1g of fosphenytoin.
Her SBP dropped to the 80s with respiratory distress an her
mental status worsened en route to [**Hospital1 18**] (from alert and
oriented at OSH). She received benadryl for possible allergic
reaction.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she was in respiratory distress, unable to
get a good SpO2, so she was intubated and started on propofol.
The propofol was stopped for hypotension, but low BPs persisted.
She was started empirically on vanc/zosyn/flagyl. EKG showed ST
depressions laterally, felt to be demand ischemia by cards. Not
clinically felt to be cardiogenic shock. FAST scan was performed
and negative. Her sats dropped to the high 70s, and she was
started on versed and vecuronium. CXR was done and consistent
with ARDS. Current vent settings include PEEP 12, and FiO2 of
100%, now satting 93-95%. 2 units of FFP were given. The
patient's SBP improved to 142, and she had never received
pressors (were going to do peripheral dopamine).
.
In the MICU, patient satting mid 80s on FiO2 1 and PEEP 12.
Overbreathing vent but responsive to fent/versed.
.
Review of systems: unable to perform

Social History:
Lives in an apartment downstairs from her grand-daughter. [**Name (NI) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
89F with Afib on coumadin, presents s/p fall with subdural
hematoma with interval development of severe hypoxemia and ARDS.

.
# Hypoxemia/ARDS. Severe refractory hypoxemia. Differential
included aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis (feel most likely),
CAP, pulmonary contusion from fall, ARDS from extrapulmonary
infection or trauma. Less likely cardiogenic pulm edema given
appearance of CXR. Bilateral infiltrates go against PE. Some
improvement with increases in sedation, but short lasting. Grave
situation discussed with family. Patient continued to actively
desat to low 70s. Felt that even aggressive intervention (CVL,
ALine, pressors, paralytics) may not be enough to get patient
through night. Family expressed understanding and wish to focus
on comfort care.  Morphine gtt and versed gtt were started.
With increases in sedation, there were improvements in O2 sats,
however she became very hypotensive.  The trade-off between
hypotension and sedation/vent compliance were discussed with the
family, and the collective feeling was to continue to make her
comfortable without other aggressive interventions.  She died at
3:31 am, in the presence of her family.  Autopsy was declined by
family, but case accepted by medical examiner.
