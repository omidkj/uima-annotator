[**2133-3-5**] CTA of Chest
Massive PE, including a saddle embolus, occluding right main
pulmonary artery
and multiple lobar, segmental and subsegmental right sided
emboli. Evidence
of right ventricular strain; right main pulmonary artery is
progressively
dilated on delayed scan.

[**2133-3-6**] Lower extremity Ultrasound
Compressible but echogenic left greater saphenous and common
femoral veins
with possible slight decrease of variability in the common
femoral veins
(compared with the right) is compatible with a more proximal
partially-occlusive thrombus.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted and underwent a laparoscopic gastric bypass on
[**2133-3-3**]. Postoperatively patient developed tachycardia and
intermittent drops in oxygen saturation. On postoperative day
one she underwent an upper gi study that confirmed no leak or
obstruction. A chest x-ray showed lung volumes relatively low,
a heart that is moderately enlarged, but no signs of
overhydration was seen and
Moderate retrocardiac atelectasis, but no evidence of pneumonia,
no pneumothorax. Patient was then given CT scan of chest. This
confirmed a Massive PE, including a saddle embolus, occluding
right main pulmonary artery and multiple lobar, segmental and
subsegmental right sided emboli. Patient was immediately started
on a heparin gtt and transfered to the intensive care unit for
close monitoring.

On postoperative day 3 patient had an ultrasound of her lower
extremities to rule out clot. This exam showed Compressible but
echogenic left greater saphenous and common femoral veins with
possible slight decrease of variability in the common femoral
veins (compared with the right) is compatible with a more
proximal
partially-occlusive thrombus.

Vascular service consulted. Recommends that INR be maintained
between 2.5 - 3. Coumadin to be continued for 6 months.

On Postoperative day 7 her heparin gtt was discontinued as her
INR was 3.5.

On postoperative day 9 her INR was 3.6.

We will discharge her home on coumadin 2.5mg daily with follow
up management by her primary care provider. [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
