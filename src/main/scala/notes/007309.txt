Chief Complaint:
hypoxia




Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Thoracentesis (Left)


History of Present Illness:
74F with h/o recently dx pancreatic adenocarcinoma (cyberknife,
gemcitabine most recently [**7-21**], attempted whipple but aborted
when positive lymph node), DM2 who had outpatient scheduled CT
scan complicated with code blue for hypoxemia.  Patient
presented for outpatient CT scan for oncology f/u.  She received
an IV contrast load. After CT scan she went for outpatient angio
study to evaluate her port since there was no blood report. (Per
patient report to IV team prior to event she had tPA in her port
overnight last night.)  On arrival to angio, patient was awake,
conversant and denied any complaints but began  to appear
dyspneic and rapidly deteriorated.  First aid was called and pt
had pulmonary rales, desat to 70s.  Suspected acute pulmonary
edema, code blue was called and patient was intubated and
transferred to ICU for further management.  BP during event was
200s systolic, HR in 130s and appeared to be sinus on monitor.

On arrival to ICU, pt is intubated and sedated.  She was
arousable to voice and tactile stimulation, and responded to
commands. She was given 40mg IV lasix with urine ouput 500cc.

Review of systems:  (unable to obtain since intubated)

IMPRESSION:
.- New bilateral pleural effusions.

no apparent mass in the liver. Consider cholangitis.
.- Enlarged pancreatic head but no distinct mass is seen.

CXR [**2130-8-10**]:
Final Report
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM:  Recent acute diastolic heart failure, status
post diuresis
and left thoracentesis.

Comparison is made with prior study, [**8-8**].

Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Mild pulmonary edema is
stable.  Small
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, are
stable.  There is no
pneumothorax or new lung abnormalities.  Right Port-A-Cath is in
unchanged
standard position.

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mild depressed with
inferolateral and basal inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The diastolic width of the pericardial
effusion anterior to the right ventricular free wall is <0.5 cm.
There is right atrial collapse and mild right ventricular
diastolic indentation/collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/early tamponade physiology.

Renal ultrasound:

IMPRESSION:
1.  Small angiomyolipoma in the left kidney.

2.  Otherwise, normal examination.  No evidence for renal artery
stenosis.

Pleural fluid:
 	
 	 ATYPICAL.
 	
 	 Rare atypical epithelioid cells in a background of reactive
 	 mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells.
 	
 	 Note: A cell block is pending and will be reported
 	 separately. The patient's prior lymph node biopsy S12-7330
 	 was also reviewed for morphologic comparison.

Cell block:

Pleural fluid, cell block:

          NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

          Mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells.

Brief Hospital Course:
74F with h/o recently dx pancreatic adenocarcinoma, DM2, type 2
DM who had standard outpatient CT scan, complicated with code
blue for hypoxia, likely secondary to acute pulmonary edema.

# Pulmonary edema: Etiology of of acute pulmonary edema was not
entirely clear but was most likely secondary to hypertension in
the setting of SBP in the 200s during the event. She was
intubated for protection of ventilation.  Per her chart, she was
not thought to have a h/o CHF however PCP is not in the [**Hospital1 18**]
system and no echocardiogram in OMR.  BNP was found to be
elevated to 12,384.  Increased osmotic load after receiving IV
contrast was also considered, as was ACS although EKG was not
suggestive of this and troponin trended down from 0.12 to 0.11.
She received 40mg IV lasix on the day of admission and her
respiratory status improved markedly after being only 800cc
negative.  She received further boluses of IV Lasix and
eventually started Lasix drip on [**8-4**] with adequate UOP; this
was discontinued on [**8-5**].  Due to a rise in the Cr to 1.3 a
