Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Esophageal food impaction and esophageal perforation.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid and flexible esophagoscopy and retrieval of esophageal
foreign body, right thoracotomy and repair of distal esophageal
perforation, intercostal muscle pedicle flap.


History of Present Illness:
88 y F h/o dementia and AF who presents upon transfer from
[**Hospital3 **] with a esophageal food impaction.  She presents
today with a copied chart but no formal discharge summary.
History is as best obtained with these sources and the help of
her son.  Pt originally presented [**12-18**] with a chocking episode
and hypoxia.  Family noticed some worsening shortness of breath
on the day the patient had a episode of choking on her meal.
During this episode she appeared to choke, then coughed up some
food and developed some respiratory distress.  In the ED, she
was found to be hypoxic with sat 75%.  Pt was w/o symptomatic
complaint at that time.  Pt admitted to ICU with diagnosis of
aspiration pnuemonitis and possible CHF.  Treated with
ABx(levofloxacin/clinda) and diuresis. Diuresis complicated by
episodes of hypotension.  AFib management unclear. Underwent 2
subsequent EGDs both of which unsuccessful in clearing a large
food bolus impacted in her esophagus. Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.  Upon arrival, pt confused and
tachycardic, hemodynamically stable. Pt unable to give history
and denies any symptomatic complaints.

Past Medical History:
osteoporosis
afib
dementia

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU and was intubated for her
respiratory distress which was thought to be due to either
aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.  The patient's DNR/DNI
status was reversed.  She had an EGD on the evening of admission
and found to have broccoli impaction.  Large amounts of food was
able to be extracted.  An attempt was made to wean the sedation
and extubate the patient the following day.  As the propofol
sedation was weaned off, the patient became increasingly
agitated and self extubated herself.  She had an adequate oxygen
saturation on 100% face tent and did not require intubation.

The patient was made strict NPO and the plan was to have a
second EGD to reassess for retained food.  On [**2177-12-23**], the
patient had another EGD which demonstrated food in the middle
and lower third of the esophagus.  The scope was able to be
passed through the site of retained food to the stomach with
moderate difficulty.  An attempt was made to push the retained
food particles into the stomach, however this was done without
success.  The following day, the decision was made to electively
intubate the patient and re-attempt EGD to try to remove the
food particles with an overtube.  However, this attempt was
again unsuccessful and the procedure was aborted.

Thoracic surgery was consulted and the patient went to the OR on
[**2177-12-25**] for a rigid and flexible esophagoscopy in an attempt to
clear the food.  During the rigid esophagoscopy, a full
thickness tear was noted in the esophagus at approximatedly 30cm
from the incisors.  Informed consent was obtained from the
patient's son for an open repair of her esophageal perforation
which the patient tolerated well and was transferred to the ICU
in stable condition.  Post-operatively, the patient was placed
on broad spectrum empiric antibiotics.  She was started on TPN
for nutrition.

The patient was able to be extubated on post-op day 1.  However,
she required reintubation for repiratory decompensation and
hypotension on post-op day 2.  The patient received frequent
bronchoscopies to suction her copious airway secretions and was
started on stress dose steroids for her hypotension. To evaluate
for possible pulmonary embolism, the patient had a CT scan which
showed a 8 x 12 mm thrombus in the left atrial appendage.  The
patient was started on a heparin drip for this.

On [**2177-12-30**], the patient was taken to the OR for a tracheostomy
and G tube and J tube placement which she tolerated well.  The G
tube was left to gravity and tube feeds via the J tube were
slowly advanced to goal and the TPN was discontinued.  The
patient was able to be weaned off the vent and was able to
tolerating breathing via trach collar.  Frequent suctionings of
the patient's tracheostomy were done to clear her airway
secretions.  The patient finished a 2 week course of ceftriaxone
for Klebsiella that grew from her sputum.  The patient also
developed a MRSA pneumonia and was started on Vancomycin for
this.

From a neurologic standpoint, the patient continued to have
delirium throughout her hospital course, being unresponsive to
commands and minimally active.  Neurology was consulted to
provide recommendations.  EEG showed encephalopathy and MRI/MRA
of the head was essentially normal with no infarctions shown.
If there is improvement in the patient's decreased mental
status, progression would likely be very slow and the hope is
having the patient placed in a rehab facility would help with
her mental status.

The patient's chronic atrial fibrillation was managed with beta
blockers and anticoagulation.  She was transitioned to coumadin
from her heparin drip and her INR was monitored closely.  From a
fluid/electrolyte standpoint, the patient was diuresed
aggressively for fluid overload and she developed hyponatremia.
Her tube feeds were switched to full strength and her sodium
trended up into the normal range.  The patient was discharged on
[**2178-1-13**] in stable condition.
