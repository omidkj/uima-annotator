Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83 year old male with
coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2146**] and [**2145**] with left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the
LPL, saphenous vein graft to posterior descending and mitral
regurgitation, recent PCIs of saphenous vein graft to LPL,
details unknown and saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery, status post stent in [**State 108**].  More recent
catheterization in [**2163-6-29**] and [**2164-6-28**].  [**2163-6-29**] catheterization showed an occluded saphenous vein graft
to posterior descending artery, underwent angioplasty and
renal lytic thrombectomy in [**2164-2-27**].  There is a 50%
proximal stenosis of the saphenous vein graft to LPL and an
80% mid vessel lesion, and at that time the vessel was
stented times two.  He presented on [**2164-7-2**] with
complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath.  The patient
went into pulmonary edema and was intubated also with a
history of mitral regurgitation.  The patient was brought to
catheterization while intubated.  The catheterization showed
wedge of 13, severe mitral regurgitation, left main 80%,
proximal left anterior descending 80%, mid left anterior
descending 100%, proximal circumflex 70%, saphenous vein
graft to LPL 90%, left internal mammary artery normal.
Intervention, angiogram and renal lytic thrombectomy with a
bail-out stent placement.  The patient had no complications.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, see history
of present illness, diabetes mellitus on Glucophage, Actos
and Prandin, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, status post
transient ischemic attack, gout, gastroesophageal reflux
disease.

ALLERGIES:  Indomethacin causes gastrointestinal bleed.

AT-HOME MEDICATIONS:  Furosemide 80 q.d., Enteric coated
Aspirin, Allopurinol 30 q.d., Imdur 60 q.d., Atenolol, Actos,
Prandin, Glucophage, Pepcid, Lipitor 20 q.d., Digoxin 0.25
q.d., Lisinopril 10 q.d., Colace and Ophthalmic drops.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has no history of smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination vital signs revealed
temperature currently 96.6, blood pressure 105/51 with a
heartrate of 63.  He was on CMV title volume 700, breathing
at 13 with positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 on 100%
oxygen and his arterial blood gases earlier was 7.28 pH with
pCO2 of 47 and pO2 of 36.  In general he is intubated, awake
and alert.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equal
and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes moist.  Neck, no
jugulovenous pressure.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2 with II/VI systolic murmur at the apex.
Lungs, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Palpable posterior tibial pulses, nonpalpable
dorsalis pedis pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count showed white blood
count of 13.0, hematocrit 33.9, platelets 229.  Chem-7,
sodium 138, potassium 5.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 25, BUN
47, creatinine 1.4, glucose 166.  Electrocardiogram
precatheterization showed minimal ST depressions in V5 and
V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent brachytherapy on
[**2164-7-4**] without complications.  Post brachytherapy the
intraaortic balloon pump was discontinued.  Then on [**2164-7-5**], blood pressures continued to rise.  Systolic blood
pressure was up to 190/200.  On [**7-6**], the patient was
given multiple doses of Metoprolol and started on Captopril
and Norvasc which were titrated up, so there was a very high
blood pressure and then on [**7-6**], the patient spiked a
temperature to 102.1.  He was pancultured at that time.  His
arterial line site was tender and was discontinued.  Blood
cultures times two were sent.  Sputum and urine cultures were
sent.  He was started on Oxacillin for presumed line
infection.  Then two hours later when he became short of
breath with oxygen saturations down to 80% acutely chest
x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate suspicious for
pneumonia.  So, Oxacillin was discontinued and the patient
was started on Levofloxacin 500 q.d.  Electrocardiogram
showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V4 and V5, thus he needs a
second precatheterization.  The cardiologist covering was
notified and suggested starting heparin for possible
ischemia.  The patient was started on 850 cc per hour without
bolus and he was put on nonrebreather and weaned quickly to
nasal cannula with oxygen saturations to 98%.  Then blood
cultures grew out gram positive cocci in clusters and he was
started on Vancomycin for Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus coverage and continued on Levofloxacin
for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus coverage and
pneumonia coverage.  The cultures eventually came back
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  The Vancomycin
was discontinued.  He was started on Oxacillin and
Levofloxacin was continued.

Congestive heart failure, the patient with a previous
echocardiogram that states that ejection fraction was 15%
with 4+ mitral regurgitation, however, echocardiogram done
here on [**7-4**] showed minimal decreased systolic function
and trace mitral regurgitation.

Infectious disease, cultures grew out Methicillin-sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus from blood cultures and from arterial
line catheter tip.  Sputum culture showed rare growth.  Urine
grew Levofloxacin sensitive enterococcus.  The patient was
treated on Oxacillin and Levofloxacin and was to continue
treatment for a total of 14 days for bacteremia.

Hematology, the patient was noted to have coffee grounds from
nasogastric tube.  Aspirin and Plavix were continued for
treatment of stent, however, he was continued on Protonix and
guaiac stools times three.  The patient was transfused 2
units of packed red blood cells throughout the course of the
hospitalization for hematocrit less than 30.  Otherwise
hematocrit remained stable.

Renal, creatinine stayed stable throughout this stay.

Endocrine, he was covered with a regular insulin sliding
scale without complications.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to extended care facility for
intravenous antibiotics.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  In-stent thrombosis
