Chief Complaint:
substernal chest pain

History of Present Illness:
61 year old female w/ CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**2103**], stable
angina, CHF, HTN, Type 1 DM, ESRD on hemodialysis who awoke at 4
am today w/ moderately severe substernal chest pain w/ nausea,
emesis x 1, and SOB lasting 5 minutes w/ spontaneous resolution
without nitrates.  Pt reported that she had similar episode 1
month ago when she was hoptalized for DKA and pancreatitis.  In
ED, cardiac enzymes x 1 were normal, EKG showed
pseudonormalization in V3 and V4 without reciprocol ST
depression, no q waves.  Pt received [**Year (4 digits) **], BB, hep gtt.  She is
now chest pain free, however still feels "congested" requireing
O2 via nasal canula.  Pt reports non-productive cough, no
fevers.  Recent 8 lb wt gain over past month.  No orthopnea or
PND.  Pt was also recently initiated on hemodialysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old female w/ multiple medical problems including CAD
s/p 5 vessel CABG in [**2103**] now w/ unstable angina, HTN, DM, ESRD
admitted w/ substernal chest pain initially refusing to undergo
cath.  While in [**Name (NI) **] pt was put on heparin gtt and subsequently
developed coffee-ground hematemesis.  She also went into DKA and
was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

Hospital course, briefly, by problem:

1.  GI bleed

Upon initiation of the heparin gtt, pt began having coffee
ground emesis.  NV lavage performed in ED for 500 cc did not
clear, and a repeat lavage of 2 liters showed persistent coffee
grounds.  EGD was performed by GI that did not show any active
bleeding but did demonstrate esophageal candidiasis, a
[**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, erythema in the stomach body and duodenal
bulb compatible with mild gastritis and duodenitis.  The heparin
gtt was stopped and the patient was placed on IV protonix 40 mg
[**Hospital1 **].  Her hematocrit initally nadired at 27.7 and she was
transfused 2 units of pRBCs secondary to her hx of CAD.  Her
hematocrit has since remained stable around 30.  On hospital day
#10, the pt's hematocrit dropped slightly to 28.1 and she was
transfused one more unit of pRBCs in order to keep her hct above
30 and protect her from further ischemia.  Over the last 6 days
of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, her hematocrit remained > 30 and
stable and she required no further tranfusion.

2.  Chest pain/CAD

Cardiac enzymes were cycled upon admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] (CK: 114
-> 52 -> 60; troponin: 0.11 -> 0.11 -> 0.12 - slightly elevated
at baseline given ESRD) with no bump.  EKG showed normal sinus
rhythm w/ slight left axis deviation and previous t wave
inversions now upright in leads V4-V6.  It was felt that cardiac
catheterization would be an appropriate next step as the
patientw as having chest pain at rest, but the patient initially
refused to undergo cardiac catheterization as she attributed her
[**Hospital Unit Name **] failure to the catheterization she had one year previously
with a contrast load.

She was tranferred to the floor from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on hospital day #
2 and the medical management of her CAD was maximized.  Her
aspirin was continued at 325 mg qday, atorvastatin was continued
at 10 mg q day, indur was increased to 60 mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril was
increased to 30 mg q day, and metoprolol was increased to 100 mg
[**Hospital1 **].  While on the floor, the pt continued to have intermittent
episodes of chest pain at rest and was briefly restarted on a
heparin gtt.  She ultimately decided to undergo cardiac
catheterization, and on [**9-7**] (hospital day #8) cardiac cath was
performed without incident revealing a right dominant system w/
severe native two vessel CAD; patent saphenous vein graft to
distal RCA; SVG to OM1/OM2 also patent but supplying relatively
small vessels.  Small, atretic LIMA -> dLAD w/ significant
reflux of dye in the subclavian vein likely secondary to
recently placed L arm AV fistula; no stenting was performed.

The patient had one further episode of chest pain on hospital
day #12 that was quickly relieved w/ sublingual nitroglycerin.
An EKG was obtained that did not show any change from prior
EKGs.  Cardiac enzymes were also cycled again without a bump.
During the course of the hospitalization, the patient was
restarted on hydralazine and titrated up to a dose of 25 mg qid
to better control her blood pressure.

3.  Steal phenomenon/ AV fistula banding

During the patient's cardiac catheterization, it was noted that
the recently placed AV
