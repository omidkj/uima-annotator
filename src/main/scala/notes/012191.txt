Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Lap R Colectomy
s/p exlap for postop hypotension & falling hct


History of Present Illness:
84M Russian-speaking with h/o severe 3-vessel CAD
unamenable to PCI s/p CABG x4 ([**2157**]) and MI x3, chronic angina,
DM, CHF (EF 30-35%) presented from clinic with progressive
dyspnea x 2 days. The patient developed SOB and worsening
orthopnea at home. He was also having chest pain which is
similar to his chronic angina. He denies fevers, chills, cough,
or sick contacts and reports that he was taking his medications
at home. At clinic, he was noted to have increased peripheral
edema (increased over 1 wk per the patient) and was sent to the
ED where his vitals were T 97.1 HR 76 BP 148/80 RR 25 SpO2
92%/RA. Bilateral crackles and elevated JVD were noted on
examination. CXR revealed bilateral layering effusions and
pulmonary edema. ECG was unchanged and cardiac enzymes were CK
137, MB 9, TnT 0.02. He received [**Year (4 digits) **], sl NTG x2, morphine 2mg
IV, and lasix 40mg IV. He was admitted for diuresis and r/o MI.
.
Of note, he has had similar admissions in the past for anginal
exacerbations and heart failure, including a recent NSTEMI in
[**2-/2172**] (CK up to 1376) that required management in the CCU with
an intraaortic balloon pump. He underwent cardiac cath at that
admission that resulted in angioplasty of a significant 80% left
main lesion, that subsequently restenosed. He subsequently
underwent cardiac cath on [**2172-3-26**] that was unsuccessful at
circumflex revascularization, resulting in dissection of that
artery and contained perforation. Per recent cardiology note,
there are no further options for revascularization and his
medications are being optimized prior to surgery as he was also
recently found to have an adenocarcinoma in his cecum with plans
for future resection. He was admitted to the General Surgery
service for excision of the colon mass

Physical Exam:
Vitals - T 95.5 BP 132/65 HR 78 RR 20 SpO2 98%/3L
Generally the patient was elderly, well developed, well
nourished and well groomed. The patient was oriented to person,
place and time. The patient's mood and affect were not
inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  The neck was supple with JVP of 12cm.  The carotid
waveform was normal.  There was no thyromegaly. The were no
chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.  The respirations
were not labored and there were no use of accessory muscles. The
lungs were with decreased breath sounds at the bases and rales
1/3rd of the lower lung fields bilaterally.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line.  There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4.  The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops. There was a well-healed sternotomy scar.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis, or
clubbing.  There was 2+ bilateral pitting lower extremity edema.
There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection
and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue showed no
xanthomas.

Discharge labs:
.
EKG demonstrated NSR, normal axis, IVCD, prolonged PR, <1mm ST
depressions V4-6 with no significant change compared with prior
dated [**2172-6-27**].
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2172-6-25**] demonstrated:
EF 30-35%. The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2172-3-27**], left ventricular
systolic function now appears more depressed and right
ventricular systolic function is now depressed.
.
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**3-/2172**] demonstrated:
1. Three vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
2. Unsuccessful rotational atherectomy of the proximal
circumflex
complicated by mid vessel dissection with contained perforation.
.
CXR [**2172-7-27**] -
1.  Increasing opacity at the lung bases, possibly reflecting
evolving pneumonia and/or subsegmental atelectasis.
2.  Nodular prominence of the right pulmonary hilum, unchanged
from multiple previous studies. Findings may correlate with
right hilar lymph node as was seen on recent CT from [**2172-7-22**].
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 cardiology service with a
heart failure exacerbation.  He was diuresed and responded well.
He did have and acute exacerbation of his chronic renal failure,
and at the time of this summary, was stable @ 2.2 from a
baseline of 2. He has adenocarcinoma of the colon and was
planned for a lab-partial colectomy. He was taken to surgery on
[**2172-7-31**] after reaching medical and cardiac optimization.
  Pt was taken to the OR on [**7-31**] for lap colon resection.  Post
op he was noted to be hypotensive and was in the ICU for
hemodynamic monitoring.  Overnight, he required treatment with
vasopressors and PRBC to keep his pressure stable.  On POD#1 he
was taken urgently to the OR because of concern for bleeding.  A
900cc Intra-op clot was noted and removed in the abdomen,
however no active bleeding was noted.  He was taken back to the
ICU and continued to improve, he was extubated, was weaned off
pressor, had good UOP, and was hemodynamically stable.  On POD
#3 and 4 he was started on lasix to help diuresis which he
tolerated.  He was subsequently transferred to [**Wardname 7911**]. His
post-operative course on the floor has been stable and
uncomplicated. He was screened per physical therapy due to
instability with transfers.
