Admission Date:  [**2159-5-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2159-6-8**]

Date of Birth:   [**2105-2-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year-old
female with a history of breast cancer with known brain mets,
history of PE, recent radiation therapy and steroids who
presented in [**2159-4-2**] with myopathy presumed secondary to
sterids, which have been given for her brain mets.  She was
later sent to rehab, but returned early in [**Month (only) 547**] with
increased cough with exertion with fever to 101.  She was
treated with Levaquin given her temperatures and differential
diagnosis of increased PE burden load, infections or
pneumonia and questionable lymphangitic spread of her cancer.
The patient did not experience improvement in her symptoms
and was readmitted on [**5-21**] with continued dyspnea and fevers.
Review of CTA showed no PE, but there was ground glass
opacities on CT, so PCP was considered highly unlikely given
her recent history of steroid use.  Her induced sputum was
negative and BOL was done and also negative.  Sputum cultures
were negative.  She was given Bactrim and she had improvement
in the shortness of breath after her Bactrim was started and
improved room air sats and was sent home on Bactrim.  She
then continued to do poorly and then returned on [**5-29**].  She
presented on clinic on [**5-30**] with hypotension for which she
was given intravenous fluids.  She spiked a fever to 103 with
blood pressures hypertensive into the systolic 80s and with
rigors.  Chest x-ray showed a question of left lung opacity.
The patient was given Vancomycin and a gram of intravenous
fluids.  Today, the patient was found in the bathroom and
became hypoxic with saturations in the 80s and was responsive
to oxygen, but was still tachypneic without improvement and
was placed on nonrebreather.  Currently the patient is
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further medical care.
Currently the patient is short of breath without chest pain
or dysphagia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Breast cancer left side diagnosed in [**2129**] status post
[**2150**] mastectomy with 5 out of 9 positive lymph nodes.  She
was treated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant and
then later with Tamoxifen from [**2151**] to [**2156**].  In [**2158**] she had
mediastinal lymphadenopathy treated with Taxol and changed to
Navelbine on [**3-7**].  She had diagnosed brain mets in [**2159-3-4**] right side cerebella and parietal for which she was
treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and Decadron.
2.  History of pulmonary embolism in [**2159-4-2**] treated with
only aspirin secondary to brain mets.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Gastritis.
5.  Questionable history of _______________.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Protonix 40 mg q day.
2.  Megace 400 q day.
3.  Colace 200 b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Heparin subq.
6.  Prednisone 40 q day.
7.  ___________ 30 q day.
8.  Clindamycin 900 q 8.
9.  Levaquin 500 q day.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is an emergency room physician at the
[**Name9 (PRE) 882**].  She is married with three children.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination on transfer to the
Intensive Care Unit she is febrile with a low grade
temperature of 100.1, tachycardic to 110, hypotensive 85/49,
tachypneic into the 50s and 60s, 95% on nonrebreather.  In
general, she is extremely tachypneic, difficulty in speaking
words.  Her heart is regular without murmurs, rubs or
gallops, slightly tachycardic.  Her pulmonary examination
shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at
the bases.  Abdominal examination was benign.  Extremities no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  She is alert and following
commands.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 3.2, hematocrit 26.6,
platelets 130, chemistry is 131, potassium 3.0, chloride 105,
bicarb 17, BUN 10, creatinine 0.5, glucose 105.  Calcium 7.3,
phos 1.8, magnesium 1.5.  She had a gas showing 7.36, 31, 96.
She had a CT from the 29th of her abdomen and pelvis showing
marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and
question of new left sided pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension
with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest x-ray.  The
exact etiology of the patient's respiratory distress was
presumed to be questionable multifactorial.  There was
concern about possible pneumonia.  Also she had a history of
PE and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic
spread of her breast CA.  Given her fevers and shortness of
breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz, Levaquin and
__________ and Clindamycin.  Lab two antibiotics were added
considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high
risk for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**].  The patient was initially trialed on
BiPAP, but the patient was increasingly dyspneic, increased
respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on
[**6-1**].  Earlier during her Intensive Care Unit course she
underwent bronchoscopy, which was sent for cytology and
multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative.
Ultimately  her Intensive Care Unit course continued and she
began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly
from BAL lavage were found to be negative.  The patient had
multiple antibiotics withdrawn.  Clindamycin and
_______________ was discontinued early in hospital course.
Her PCP was thought to be negative.  In addition, Vancomycin,
Levaquin were also discontinued.  She was later continued on
Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative
infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that
she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy.  As the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course went on the patient's respiratory
did not show mild improvement on the ventilator.  She was
able to oxygenate originally.  Unfortunately her mental
status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative
medications for several days.  Later in her Intensive Care
Unit course family meetings took place and given the
patient's overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status
it was decided that the patient would become CMO.
Subsequently she was extubated on [**6-7**].  The patient
continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory.
However, she is CMO and will not be intubated for respiratory
distress.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was initially transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit thought to be exhibiting septic
physiology, respiratory distress and hypotensive.  She
required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required
pressor support with neo-synephrine.  Later during her
Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat
overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back.  It was
quite difficult weaning her off of neo-synephrine.  She was
also given stress dose steroids.  Later in her hospital
course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG
findings in her inferior leads.  Her echocardiogram, however,
was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of 55%
without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular
pathology.  As mentioned above the patient's hemodynamic
status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was
difficult to wean the patient off of neo-synephrine.  By [**6-7**], however, the patient had been off of neo-synephrine, but
at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be
CMO per discussion with physicians and her husband/health
care proxy.

3.  Hematology:  Patient with a history of known malignancy
and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from [**2159-4-2**].
Earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course the team was
concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible
source of the patient's respiratory decompensation.  However,
the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point
anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given
risk for hemorrhage into these tumors.  She did have lower
extremity doppler ultrasounds, which were negative.

4.  Infectious disease:  As mentioned above patient initia
