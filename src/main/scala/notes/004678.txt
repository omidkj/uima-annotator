HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old woman with
a history of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) status post
resection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
multiple hospital admissions for pneumonia, insulin
dependent-diabetes mellitus, who initially presented to the
Emergency Room on the [**2103-6-21**] complaining of
dyspnea.

The patient was found to be hypoxic and hypotensive in the
Emergency Room.  She complained of increasing shortness of
breath and a cough productive for a small amount of
reddish-brown sputum for approximately one week prior to
admission.  She also complained of subjective fevers of
approximately 101.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  The patient complained of chills,
nausea.  Denies vomiting and diarrhea.  The patient reports
that at baseline, she is fatigued and weak.  The family notes
a gradual decline in her physical function over the past six
months.  This morning the patient was found to be
dramatically more short of breath and was transported to the
Emergency Department by EMS.  Her O2 saturations on room air
were found to be 77% with an initial blood pressure of
120/90.  Her O2 saturations increased to approximately 90% on
a nonrebreather, but her systolic blood pressure dropped to
the 70's systolic.

The patient was given 1-2 liters of IV fluid, and then was
gently weaned off her nonrebreather on to a nasal cannula
mask.  Patient was also found to have an anion gap of 21 and
given her history of insulin dependent diabetes, was bolused
with 5 units of insulin and started on an insulin drip.

2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with her latest
pulmonary function tests in [**2102-9-24**] showing a FVC
of 72% of predicted value, a FEV1 of 61% of predicted value,
FEV1/FVC of 85%, a DLCO which was read as moderately to
severely depressed.

4. Arthritis.
5. Pseudogout.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. Osteoporosis.
8. Atrophic gastritis.
9. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She continues to smoke tobacco approximately
half a pack per day.  She has approximately 45 pack year
history.  She is a social drinker.  She lives at home with
her husband and son.

INITIAL LABORATORIES:  Revealed a white blood cell count of
19, hematocrit of 43.3, platelet count of 505.  INR of 1.1.
Her Chem-10 shows a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.7, chloride
of 98, bicarb of 21, BUN of 18, creatinine of 0.9, glucose of
238, anion gap of 21.  Her initial blood gas was 7.33/42/35
on 6 liters of oxygen.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Bactrim double strength.
2. Calcium/vitamin D.
3. Colchicine 0.6 grams.
4. Combivent.
5. Compazine.
6. Aspirin.
7. Folic acid.
8. Levothyroxine 75 mcg q day.
9. Percocet.
10. Protonix 40 q day.
11. Vitamin B6 25 q day.
12. Vitamin B1 1 gram q day.

CHEST X-RAY:  Revealed a right pleural effusion with
associated collapse and consolidation at the adjacent line.
A lateral decubitus was obtained showing a free flowing
fluid.  A linear opacity in the upper lung zone representing
pneumonia versus skinfold.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed sinus tachycardia at 101 beats per
minute with normal axis and normal intervals.  Q waves were
noted in leads II, III, and aVF, V2, V3.  The Q waves were
new since her electrocardiogram dated [**2102-12-10**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old woman with a history
of adenocarcinoma status post bilateral apical lung
resection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and
diabetes mellitus, who presented initially with shortness of
breath, hypoxia, hypertension, increased anion gap, acidosis,
and a troponin leak.  She was admitted to the MICU for
further evaluation.

Pulmonary:  The patient's initial hypoxia attributed to be
multifactorial to include chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, possible pneumonia, and atelectasis due to a large
pleural effusion.  She underwent a thoracentesis.  The
thoracentesis fluid revealed essentially a cellular specimen
composed of predominantly lymphoid cells with some
neutrophils and reactive mesothelial cells.  It also revealed
667 white blood cells, 889 red blood cells, 39% polys, 53%
lymphocytes, 6 monocytes, 1 eosinophil, and 1 basophil.
Total protein was 3.4 with 165 glucose and 145 for a LDH.
The pleural pH was 7.34 and the cultures were negative.

The patient was started up on levofloxacin due to possible
pneumonia.  Her sputum cultures and blood cultures remained
negative throughout her stay.  She also remained on her
inhalers.  Shortly after the thoracentesis, the patient's O2
saturation drastically improved, and the patient's pleural
effusion remained stable throughout the course of her stay.
She did not require intubation, and she was gradually weaned
from the nonrebreather to nasal cannula and eventually on to
room air with satisfactory O2 saturations.

Cardiac:  Patient was initially admitted with hypertension
with a troponin leak of approximately 11 and flat CKs.  A
STAT echocardiogram revealed regional left ventricular wall
motion abnormalities.  Specifically, revealed a mild
anteroseptal wall that was akinetic; mid inferior wall was
akinetic, mild inferolateral wall was akinetic; the mid
anterolateral wall was akinetic; the septal apex wall was
akinetic; the inferior apex was akinetic; the lateral apex
was akinetic; and the apex was akinetic; there is also
moderate tricuspid regurgitation (+2).  Ejection fraction was
estimated to be about 20%.  This showed dramatically
decreased left ventricular function with new wall
abnormalities and the patient was taken emergently to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory for a catheterization.

The catheterization revealed a cardiac output of 3.5, an
index of 2.2, a systemic vascular resistance of 2,034 with a
pulmonary vascular resistance of 320.  Her ejection fraction
was estimated to be about 25%.  The anterolateral apical and
inferior wall were akinetic.  The mid right coronary showed a
50% lesion.  The proximal left anterior descending artery was
with a 40% lesion.  The resting hemodynamic measurements
revealed systemic arterial hypertension which was responsive
to IV dopamine.  Right heart filling pressures were normal.
The wedge was slightly elevated at 17 mm Hg and the left
ventricular end diastolic pressure was 22 mm Hg.  There was
moderate significant pulmonary hypertension.

Following the catheterization, the patient remained on the
dopamine drip for pressure support.  This was gently weaned
over the next two days.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] for
further evaluation for her cardiomyopathy.

The patient had multiple laboratories sent for further
evaluation of her cardiomyopathy.  The results of these
laboratories were still pending at the time of dictation.
Specifically, a negative [**Doctor First Name **], a negative rheumatoid factor.
Her TSH was slightly elevated, but she had a normal T4.  She
had a negative hepatitis C antibody.  Her CMV IgG antibody
test was positive.  IgM antibody was negative.  Her
[**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus IgG was positive.  The IgM was negative.
Her Lyme serology was negative.

It was thought that her new cardiomyopathy could be
multifactorial.  Most importantly, it could be due to her
poor nutritional status.  It was attempted to add on an ACE
inhibitor while the patient was in-house, but unfortunately,
the blood pressure remained less than 100 systolic and this
was difficult to add on.  She will be followed closely by her
primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] attempt to add this on and
increase the dose.

Hematological:  Patient with an anemia.  Her calculated TIBC
was 146 with a ferritin of 241, and a TRF of 112.  Her
hematocrit was normal i
