SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 50 pack/year smoking

patient continues to smoke and lives at home with her
husband.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease and diabetes
mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with a
temperature of 96.7, a heart rate of 84, a blood pressure of
163/67, a respiratory rate of 17 and an oxygen saturation of
100% in room air.  In general, the patient was in no apparent
distress, resting comfortably but complaining of some nausea.
She was alert and oriented to person, place and time.  Head
and neck exam revealed no scleral icterus.  Pupils were
equal, round and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.
Mucous membranes were moist.  Pulmonary exam revealed
crackles at the bases bilaterally.  Cardiac exam revealed a
regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI holosystolic murmur at
the left lower sternal border as well as the right upper
sternal border.  Abdominal exam showed normoactive bowel
sounds with no tenderness, distention or rigidity.
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis.  The patient had
1+ pitting edema to the ankles.  The third toe on the right
foot had a small ulceration with granulation tissue and no
surrounding erythema.  Neurologic exam was non-focal.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  The patient had a white count of 25.8, a
hematocrit of 33.9 and platelets of 555,000.  Panel-7 was
significant for a BUN of 35 and a creatinine of 1.5.
Coagulation studies were significant for an INR of 1.5 and a
PTT of 25.7.  A chest x-ray showed no evidence of any
pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring of her hematocrit.
She was begun on intravenous Pantoprazole 40 mg q day.
Serial hematocrits remained stable at 33.  The patient
underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2190-10-16**].
Endoscopy results revealed ulcers in the antrum and distal
bulb with an otherwise normal second part of the duodenum.
There was noted a superficial broad surface of ulcerated
mucosa at the proximal portion of the descending duodenum.
Recommendations were to avoid all anticoagulants and aspirin
with a follow up endoscopy in four to six weeks to document
healing.  Serial hematocrits were continued, and the patient
remained stable for greater than 24 hours prior to discharge.
The patient's anticoagulation was held, with a decision to be
made by the patient's primary care provider and by
Gastroenterology.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was continued on her ACE
inhibitor and calcium channel blocker for hypertension.  She
remained in sinus rhythm throughout her hospitalization and
did not complain of any shortness of breath or chest pain.

3.  Infectious Disease:  Podiatry was consulted regarding the
right third toe ulcer.  The patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
who will follow the patient as an outpatient.  No antibiotics
were administered, and the patient's white count decreased to
12 at the time of discharge.  She remained afebrile
throughout her hospitalization.

4.  Endocrine:  While the patient was n.p.o. during her MICU
stay, the patient's home insulin dose was withheld.  As her
oral intake increased, she was advanced toward her full
outpatient doses of NPH insulin.

5.  Nutrition:  The patient was advanced to a full diabetic,
low salt diet at the time of discharge.  She was tolerating
p.o. intake well.
