abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old female with CAD, severe CHF EF
20%, s/p MVR, s/p AICD for torsades, afib, h/o CVA, h/o HIT, h/o
hydrocephalus s/p VP shunt admitted to MICU for gastroenteritis
and hypotension now transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] service. She had three
days of abd pain, n/v/d and presented to the ED yesterday. She
had a CT abd and RUQ ultrasound that showed cholelithiasis but
no cholecystitis. She had elevated lactate and BP's were in the
70's (baseline 90's) and so she was admitted to the MICU. She
had mild tranaminitis, hyponatremia and renal failure and
clinical picture was thought to be viral gastroenteritis with
dehydration. Her diuretics were stopped but she was not given
more IVF since she has very low EF and clinically did not seem
dry. Her BP improved to SBP 100 and her labs improved. She now
feels better and abd pain resolved. Abd exam was unremarkable
and she tolerated dinner. However, she had 3 loose BM's today.
Otherwise she feels well.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62yo female with CAD, severe CHF (EF ~20%),
s/p MVR, s/p AICD for torsades, atrial fibrillation, CVA, h/o
HIT, and h/o hydrocephalus (s/p VP shunt placement) admitted to
MICU for abdominal pain and hypotension who is now transferred
to [**Hospital1 1516**] service for additional workup.
.
# CORONARIES / CAD : One vessel coronary artery disease by
catheterization done in [**2177**] that showed 20% in OM. Continues to
be chest pain free since admission. Recent troponin elevattion
attributed to renal failure rather than ACS as her CK levels are
normal and she has no concerning EKG abnormalities. She was
continued on daily aspirin and beta-blocker therapy. Statin  not
given as her LDL <80 and no significant dyslipidemia. No chest
pain complaints during her stay.
.
# PUMP: Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with EF 20%, history
of rheumatic mitral valve disease with updated MVR in [**2175**]
(mechanical), and also status-post BiVentricular pacer for
synchrony. Euvolemic on exam to slightly fluid overloaded as she
has mild crackles at lung bases and JVP near 9cm. Suspect low EF
and hypoperfusion playing a role in ARF. She had diuretics held
for a few days initially due to concern for dehydration and low
blood pressures but soon restarted her  torsemide and aldactone
as she began to have slight fluid overload on exam.
Monitored strict I/O's, daily weights checked and she was placed
on a low sodium diet. INR goal 2.5-3.5 for mechanical valve (
MVR for her MR history from rheumatic disease in childhood ).
.
# RHYTHM: telemetry showing background native atrial
fibrillation with demand pacing. She is s/p BiV pacemaker.
Continued on metoprolol therapy. Because initial BPs were
marginal team did not increase dose as her rate was within
normal ranges. She had supratherapeutic INR near 8 range so held
coumadin for several days until her level corrected.
.
# Anticoagulation: initially supratherapeutic INR and warfarin
held for two days. INR subsequently 2.0 and thus argatroban
bridge for one day. On discharge INR was 4.9.
.
# Abdominal pain:
