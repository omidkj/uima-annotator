   CONTINUOUS INVASIVE MECHA

History of Present Illness:
This is a 82 year-old right-handed man who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] where he presented with left hemiplegia, left
neglect and somnolence.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] began to feel unwell at 2100, with variable
descriptions of L. arm weakness and bilateral arm weakness
(wife, the only primary witness, is not yet at [**Hospital1 18**]), an
uncertain alteration in his speech, and fatigue. After he fell
asleep his wife had ongoing worry about him, so she woke him at
2AM just to check in. At that point his speech was intact and
she thought that he seemed to be his usual self. She tried to
wake him again at 6:30, to see that he was okay, and found him
to be difficult to arouse.  His speech was slurred and garbled
and he became increasingly agitated. She also noted that his
left arm was floppy and not used. She thought that he may have
had a stroke and called EMS.

Upon arrival at [**Hospital3 **] he was thought to reported to
have a left spacial neglect and left arm paresis (no mention of
status of his legs). But then his NIHSS was recorded as 26.
Non-contrast head CT showed a dense right MCA. He was given ASA
325 and transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. tPA was not
given at that time with the presumed well-time of 0200. It seems
likely that symptoms actually started at around 2100, base on
the above history.

ROS: Unable to obtain - though his son arrived late in my
assessment, he felt that he was unable to answer questions
adequately.

Past Medical History:
- Atrial fibrillation, not on Coumadin. Daily ASA 325 only.
- Likely coronary artery disease based on regional hypokinesis
on echo (after admission)
- Ductal prostate cancer - metastatic to lungs, adrenal glands -
s/p resection of urethral mass; radiation x2, chemo last spring,
restarted last week for recurrence
- Asthma, PRN albuterol
- DM - borderline, diet controlled
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm - diagnosed 10 yrs ago, 4cm per
followup several years ago
- History of possible stroke - lost sight in L eye several
months ago
- Atrial fibrilation - purportedly remote history

Social History:
Social History: The patient lives with his wife.

Family History:
Family History: Per son, no early life strokes, no seizures.

No response to loud voice.  No volitional movements.

pupil 2 to 1.5mm.

VIII: 	No response to speech.

[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 	SCM and trapezii full.
XII: 	Unable to assess - intubated.

Motor: No volitional movements. Responses to nailbed pressure
are
present in all four extremities, limited to small amplitude
withdrawal. No difference in degree of response between L and R
side.  L. arm and leg have decreased tone relative to R.  With
grasp of the R. hand, he makes incoherent and uncoordinated
grasping motions.  With stimulation he initiates a ~10Hz tremor
at the R. wrist and fingers, flexion-extension.

Non-Contrast Head CT [**2184-5-24**]
IMPRESSION: Acute infarct in the distribution of right MCA and
ACA territories, with evidence of mass effect on the right
lateral ventricle. There is 13-mm leftward shift of normally
midline structures, which appears increased since [**2184-5-22**].
Subfalcine herniation is noted. Mild uncal herniation cannot be
completely excluded.

Echo [**2184-5-24**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and
inferolateral walls, and distal lateral wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**2-15**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation likely due to papillary muscle dysfunction.

MRI/MRA Brain
IMPRESSION: Absence of flow in the right internal carotid artery
in the neck as well as in the cavernous and supraclinoid portion
indicative of occlusion. Faint flow is seen in the M2 segment in
sylvian branches of the right middle cerebral artery, likely
secondary to collateral flow. Otherwise, the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation demonstrate flow signal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82-year-old man with an extensive right
MCA/ACA stroke with significant mass effect. Given his numerous
other medical porblems, particularly metastatic prostate cancer,
and given the patient's philosophy, as understood by his family,
they decided to focus care on comfort. He was extubated and his
family spent time with him prior to him expiring.
