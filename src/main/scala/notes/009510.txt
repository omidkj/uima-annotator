HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old
woman with an extensive past medical history recently
discharged on [**2121-12-1**] after a seven day stay for CHF
exacerbation and cellulitis.  She was discharged to
rehabilitation and then subsequently sent home.  The patient
was home for approximately one week.  On the day of
admission, EMS was called by the home VNA for finding the
patient lethargic and hypoglycemic with fasting blood sugars
approximately 41.  The patient reports that she had been
lethargic for approximately one week, very sleepy.  EMS found
the patient lethargic and responsive to voice but
inappropriate responsiveness.  She was given 1 amp of D50 and
fasting blood sugar of 145.  The patient was given 2 mg of
Narcan and became more alert and oriented, although she was
saturating into the 80s and had some eye fluttering that was
thought to be possible seizure-like activity and emesis after
given Narcan which led to desaturation into the 80s and the
patient was intubated for airway protection.

In the ED, she was given thiamine 100 mg, Ativan 2 mg times
five, metomidate 20 mg, and succinylcholine 120 mg IV.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post multiple previous
interventions.  The most recent intervention was a PTCA to
the PDA in [**2118**].  Last catheterization was in [**3-10**] when she
developed pulmonary edema in the setting of a non ST
elevation MI and was referred to catheterization and found
diffuse noncritical disease up to 60% in the RCA and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus, on insulin.
3.  COPD, on home oxygen, approximately 2 liters.  Pulmonary
function testing of [**10-8**] showed a restricted picture as
well.
4.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, managed with Coumadin,
originally managed with Amiodarone and on Norpace.  The
patient was DC cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm one
month prior to this admission.
5.  Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic
dysfunction, EF of 75-80%, mild aortic regurgitation, and

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 69-year-old divorced woman,
the mother of three grown children, and retired accountant.
She lives alone in her own apartment in [**Location (un) **].  Her PCP
is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  She hires people to help her with
activities of daily living.  The patient's daughter is her
health care proxy.  The patient is full code.  She admits to
rare alcohol use.  She smoked marijuana occasionally.  She
has no other illicit substance use.  She smoked cigarettes on
and off for approximately 20 years but quit in [**2104**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  90.5
kilograms.  She was afebrile.  Heart rate 68, blood pressure
systolic 71, then 36, and then 90/44.  Ventilator settings
were established.  General:  On examination, the patient was
intubated and sedated with no apparent distress.  HEENT:  She
had anicteric sclerae.  The pupils were sluggishly reactive
to light, symmetric and constricted to 2 mm bilaterally.  She
had a positive corneal reflex bilaterally.  Her ET tube was
in place 23 cm at her teeth.  Neck:  Supple with JVP to 9 cm
at 30 degrees.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, normal S1, S2,
question of a diastolic murmur at the right sternal border,
no rubs or gallops audible.  Chest:  Occasional crackles
bilaterally at the bases with rare rhonchi in the upper
zones, moderate aeration.  The patient was found to have two
75 microgram Fentanyl patches on her back.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel sounds, and no
hepatosplenomegaly or pulsatile masses.  Extremities:  Warm,
dry, with trace edema, and strong 2+ radial pulses
bilaterally.  She had 1+ pitting edema to her ankles with ACE
wraps on her lower extremities bilaterally for chronic
venostasis ulcers present.  Neurologic:  As stated, she was
intubated and sedated with sluggish pupils but responsive.
She moved all of her extremities periodically and had no
overt seizure activity.  Skin:  She had no diaphoresis.  She
had venostasis ulcers on her lower extremities and no rashes.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Hematocrit 29.6, normal white
blood cell count at 7.6, normal differential.  Electrolytes:
Bicarbonate 40, baseline in the low 30s, BUN 40, baseline of
approximately 32, creatinine 1.6 with a baseline of
approximately 1.2 to 1.3.  Calcium, magnesium, phosphate,
LFTs, amylase, and lipase were all within normal limits.  INR
was 2.4.  The U/A revealed specific gravity of 1.008,
negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrates.

Head CT revealed no evidence of hemorrhage and a possible
right occipital condyle fracture, but seemed to be old.

Chest x-ray showed cardiac enlargement, pulmonary edema of
both lungs, and a right-sided pleural effusion consistent
with fluid overload or CHF  with a superimposed infectious
process could not be excluded by the radiologic findings.

EKG revealed a sinus rhythm, normal axis, prolonged PR
intervals, QTC greater than 430, and no ST-T wave changes
when compared with previous EKGs.

ASSESSMENT:  The initial assessment was that she is a
69-year-old woman with an extensive past medical history who
was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after being intubated
in the setting of lethargy, a question of seizure activity,
emesis, and recent hypoglycemia.  The fact that the patient's
mental status is most likely effected by medication,
especially in the setting of her chronic renal insufficiency,
there was also concern for pneumonia and given the patient's
history of BOOP she was started on steroids.

All psychoactive medications were withdrawn and the patient's
mental status was monitored.  It was concerning that the patient
was wearing two 75 microgram Fentanyl patches given her history
of being only 75 micrograms at the last discharge.  The
patient reported that she was increased to 100 micrograms
recently after requiring approximately 40-45 mg of p.o.
morphine extra q.d.  The patient reports that after that
point her sleepiness began to overcome her each day and she
found herself eating less each day but continuing to take all
of her medications as prescribed including her insulin.

On day number two of admission, the patient had a
bronchoalveolar lavage to evalu
