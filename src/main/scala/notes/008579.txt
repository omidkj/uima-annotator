History of Present Illness:
50 yo male with h/o COPD/asthma, HCV, multiple burns, presented
to the ED with pleuritic chest pain.  The day prior, he had felt
SOB, both with exertion and at rest.  Also stabbing chest pain
in the center of his chest through to his back.  Denied nausea,
vomiting, fever, chills, increased productive cough.  Fell on
his left side 1.5 months ago while trying to catch a bus.  PCP
felt it was contusion vs. rib fracture, gave naproxen.

In ED, initial vitals were 99.6, 113, 124/86, 20, 92%.  CXR in
ED showed whiteout of left hemithorax.  CT showed large pleural
effusion.  Got one dose of levofloxacin.  Chest tube placed by
IP drained 600cc serosanguinous fluids.  Required
non-rebreather.  Transferred to the ICU for hypoxia, satting 92%
on non-rebreather pending further evaluation.  In the ICU also
received pigtail in addition to chest tube.  Pleural fluid:
Protein 5.3, Glucose 85, LDH 349, WBC 500, RBC [**Numeric Identifier 15851**], Poly 25,
Lymph 50, Mono 10, Eos 15, consistent with exudate based on
elevated LDH and protein.  In the ICU, chest tube decreased, and
10mg TPA was instilled.  Antibiotics were discontinued but
patient remained afebrile, WBC normal.

On arrival to the floor, pt was resting comfortably, though was
in minimal respiratory distress having removed his nasal canula.
 Vitals on arrival were 97.2, 135/86, 105, R20, Sat 95% on 3L.
Pt currently complains of mild chest pain on the left, but no
difficulty breathing.  No cough.

IMAGING
[**7-15**]
CT Chest:
1. Large left non-septated pleural effusion with near-complete
compressive atelectasis of the left lung and slight rightward
mediastinal shift.
2. Nonspecific ground-glass opacity in right lung apex.
3. Numerous bilateral subacute-appearing rib fractures.

[**7-15**] CXR:
Interval improvement in aeration of the left upper lung field
status post placement of a left sided chest tube. Large left
pleural effusion, slightly improved in the interval.

[**7-18**] Abdominal US:
1.  No ascites.
2.  Limited exam due to patient's body habitus.  Within this
limitation,
unremarkable abdominal ultrasound exam.  Spleen is not
visualized.

[**7-18**] CXR:
Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Left PICC and
left
apically directed chest tube are in unchanged position.  Left
pleural pigtail catheter is seen with kinks that are less severe
than on the recent prior study suggesting it has been
manipulated.  Right lung is well aerated.  Left lung
demonstrates nearly resolved left dependent effusion, with
unchanged moderate quantity of pleural fluid tracking along the
mediastinum. Left basal atelectasis is decreased.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.

[**7-20**] CXR: (after removal of chest tube)
There is a left-sided PICC line with distal lead tip in the
distal SVC.
Pigtail catheter is seen at the left lung base.  Since the prior
study, therehas been increase in the pleural effusion on the
left side.  There is also increased opacity and volume loss at
the left side.  No pneumothoraces areseen.  The right lung is
relatively clear.  Heart size is within normal limits.

[**7-21**] Chest CT:

Newly introduced left pigtail catheter.  Decrease in extent of
the pleural fluid collection, but evidence of loculated fluid
collections
laterally and anteriorly of the thoracic cavity on the left,
associated with pleural thickening and pleural enhancement,
concerning for empyema.  Slightly increased size of the still
normal lymph nodes in the mediastinum.  Atelectatic changes at
the bases of the left lung.  No characteristic ground-glass
opacities in the right lung apex.  Older healing rib fractures
on the left.

[**2177-7-24**] Renal US :
No evidence of hydronephrosis or renal abnormality is seen on
this ultrasound.

&/17/12 Chest CT :
1.  New, large bore left chest tube, replacing a pigtail drain,
ends in the slightly smaller posterior component of, small,
anteriorly and posteriorly loculated, left pleural fluid
collection. At least one tube sideport is extrathoracic in the
large submuscular collection of mostly air and a small amount of
fluid communicating
