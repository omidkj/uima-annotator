Admission Date:  [**2135-5-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2135-5-25**]

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

ADDENDUM:  The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple
admissions for congestive heart failure in the past with
decrease in ejection fraction from 53% to 25% over a period
of eight months.  He presented to the cardiac surgical
service on [**2135-5-17**] for a three-vessel coronary artery bypass
grafting.

The patient underwent an uncomplicated coronary artery bypass
grafting x 3 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG to diagonal).

Postoperatively the patient was transferred to the cardiac
surgery recovery unit for close observation and monitoring.
Postoperatively the patient developed a high-grade AV block
which in comparison to the preoperative EKG done on [**5-12**],
the patient showed prolonged PR as well as left bundle branch
block.  The patient became completely dependent upon
epicardial pacing thereafter with no evidence of escape
rhythm.  Aside from this EP issue the patient's postoperative
course has been going well and the patient was extubated with
hemodynamics stable with pressors weaned.  Because of the
high-grade AV block the patient underwent an ICD implantation
without any complications.

By postoperative day number three the patient's Foley
catheter, chest tube, as well as pacing wires were removed
without any complications and the patient was transferred to
the floor.
