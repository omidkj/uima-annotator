HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 547**] is an 82 year old male
with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm, who
presented with stuttering chest pain for two weeks and was
awoken from sleep the night prior to admission, with crushing
substernal chest pain. He went to All [**Doctor Last Name 15594**] [**Hospital 107**]
Hospital where he was found to have [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations
anteriorly and received thrombolytics.  At 5:30 a.m. on the
day of admission, he was administered these thrombolytics and
only had minimal improvement in his ST elevations and in his
chest pain. He was given aspirin, Plavix and placed on a
heparin drip. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for rescue angioplasty.

In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, he was found to
have elevated filling pressures with an RA pressure of 18, RV
EDP of 21; PA pressure of 46/26; cardiac output of 5.2 and
cardiac index of 2.6.  He had a 40% proximal left main
occlusion, 99% left anterior descending occlusion and had
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting
of his left anterior descending lesion with resultant
TIMI-II flow.  He also had a left circumflex distal
occlusion and mild right coronary artery disease.

While in the catheterization laboratory, he became
hypotensive and developed complete heart block and a
temporary pacing wire was placed. He also developed systolic
blood pressure to the 50's and an intra-aortic balloon pump
was placed and was started.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.) Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation.  2.)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on chronic steroids and on
no home oxygen.  3.) Abdominal aortic aneurysm.  4.) History of
colonic resection for unknown etiology.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 547**] lives at home with his wife. [**Name (NI) **]
denies any tobacco or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Albuterol MDI.
2.  Azmacort.
3.  Atrovent MDI.
4.  Amiodarone 100 mg q. day.
5.  Prednisone 5 mg q. day.
6.  Digoxin .125 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Zantac.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vital signs revealed a
blood pressure of 91/48; heart rate of 87; respirations of
12; 91% on two liters nasal cannula.  He was afebrile with a
temperature of 96.1.  In general, he was confused, however,
in no acute distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  He had moist
mucous membranes.  His jugular venous distention was noted to
be approximately 12 cm.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally anteriorly.  Heart was regular with a normal S1
and S2; there was an appreciable S3.  He had distant heart
sounds. No murmurs were appreciated. His abdomen was obese,
nontender, nondistended.  He had normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities were warm and without clubbing, cyanosis or
edema.  He had a 2+ dorsalis pedis pulse on the right and a
1+ dorsalis pedis pulse on the left.  He had 2+ posterior
tibial pulses bilaterally.  He had a right groin with a Swan
and A line without any evidence of oozing.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC revealed a white count of 15.6 with
hematocrit of 38.3.  Chemistries revealed sodium of 140;
potassium of 4.3; chloride of 112; bicarbonate of 22; BUN of
20; creatinine of 1.4 and glucose of 133.

Cardiac catheterization revealed filling pressures reported
in the history of present illness.  He also had vessel
disease as described in the history of present illness. He
underwent stenting to his left anterior descending with
resultant TIMI-II flow.

A preprocedure electrocardiogram showed evidence of a right
bundle branch block with 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevations in leads V1
through V4.  Post procedure electrocardiogram revealed an
irregular rhythm with a rate of 75.  There was evidence of
atrial fibrillation.  There was also evidence of right bundle
branch block.  He had Q waves in V1 through V4 and T wave
inversions in V1 through V3.  He had persistent ST elevations
anteriorly and evidence of a left anterior fascicular block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Cardiovascular:  In regards to
ischemia, as mentioned above, Mr. [**Known lastname 547**] suffered a large
anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction and underwent
stenting to his left anterior descending, with subsequent
poor reperfusion flow.  He was started on aspirin, statin,
and Plavix at 75 mg q. day after being loaded in the
catheterization laboratory.  He was initially not started on
Captopril and a betablocker in the setting of cardiogenic
shock.  He was eventually restarted on his ace inhibitor and
betablocker and will be discharged to rehabilitation on ace
inhibitor, betablocker, statin, aspirin and Plavix.

In regards to pump function, as mentioned before in the
catheterization laboratory, Mr. [**Known lastname 547**] became hypotensive,
requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and Dopamine. He had an
echo the day after admission which revealed a dilated left
ventricular cavity.  There was severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis to akinesis with some preservation of basal wall
motion.  The overall left ventricular systolic dysfunction
was severely depressed.  He had an ejection fraction of less
than 25%.  He had a trivial valvular disease.  He was able to
eventually be weaned off his intra-aortic balloon pump and
pressors.  His balloon pump was weaned off as his ace
inhibitor was titrated.  He was also diuresed prn. He will be
discharged home on a betablocker and ace inhibitor as well as
standing p.o. Lasix.

In regards to his rhythm, there was evidence of complete
heart block in the catheterization laboratory, requiring a
temporary pacing wire.  He had this ventricular pacing wire
for several days, which was subsequently augmented with a
coronary sinus pacer for AV synchrony, to help with cardiac
output.  He underwent AICD and pacer placement on [**2101-12-29**]
without complications.  After the AICD and pacer placement,
he was noted to intermittently be V-paced versus both A and V
paced.  He was also noted to be in atrial fibrillation early
in his CCU course and was anticoagulated for this.  He was
also cardioverted after one day of being in atrial
fibrillation and then was loaded on Amiodarone which was
subsequently titrated down to his home dose of 100 mg q. day.
He developed a pericardial effusion several days into his CCU
course and his anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation was
discontinued.  It was thought that this effusion was most
likely secondary to removal or the initial ventricular pacing
wire.

The pericardial effusion was watched for several days with
serial echocardiograms; however, his effusion continued to
grow and he ultimately had a pericardial drain placed on
[**2101-12-29**] which was removed after several days.  It was decided
by the team not to restart him on anticoagulation due to his
high risk for bleeding.

2.) Pulmonary:  Mr. [**Known lastname 547**] has a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease on steroids with a dose of
Prednisone 5 q. day at home. He was initially started on
stress dose steroids which were tapered throughout his
course.  He will be discharged home on 5 mg of Prednisone
p.o. q. day. He was continued on his MDI's and nebs prn.  He
had a persistent oxygen requirement throughout admission,
felt to most likely be due to congestive heart failure.
There was no evidence of an active chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare.  His heart failure was managed, as
mentioned above, with prn Lasix and he will be discharged
home on Lasix 40 mg q. day.

3.) Gastrointestinal:  After being transferred from the CCU
to the floor, on [**2102-1-1**], Mr. [**Known lastname 547**] had several episodes of
melena with a 3% drop in his hematocrit.  He was asymptomatic
at this time.  Nasogastric lavage was negative.  He
transiently required fluids and Dopamine while on the floor
and was transferred back to the CCU.  Gastrointestinal was
cons
