Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, lip and tongue swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84yo w/PMHx significant for HTN, CKD, CVA (hemiplegia in [**2155**]),
diastolic heart failure, HLD, PVD refered from [**Hospital 100**] rehab
after bolus fluids for [**Last Name (un) **] given poor PO intake and elevated Cr
on labs (felt to be pre-renal) and lasix held yesterday. However
after fluids bolus of 1L, pt became hypoxic to 85% w/crackles. K
elevated to 5.5 at [**Hospital **] rehab, got kayexalete. She was then
given 60mg lasix w/out much improvement despite diuresis at
which point transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Pt has had gradual decline in
MS (somnolent, but no confusion). Also developed large tongue
and protruding lower lip concerning for angioedema in setting of
chronic ACEI use. However, per report swelling developed slowly
since her recent ED admission on [**2171-4-1**] during which she was
started on augmentin. Other than this she has had no medications
but has been on enalapril for extended period (duration
unknown).

Of note, pt was hospitalized ~1 mo ago for PVD, failed LLL
angioplasty and stent intervention for ischemia which failed and
amputation under consideration for chronic non healing ulcer. Pt
has been on oxycodone for pain which has resulted in sedation
and consequently poor PO intake. Pt now has Cr of 3.3 (baseline
2.0) on labs. Also had bought of cellulitis for which she
presented to ED on [**4-1**] which was treated w/augmentin and
cellulitis improved.

In ED, arousable, follows comands, VS 98.4 74 139/59 20 97% 4L,
now on 2L 96%. Diffuse crackles throught; no lower extremity
edema,benign ab exam. Replaced foley with stable inguinal
hematoma (firm indurated, no erythematous or warm there for [**1-18**]
days). Elected not to image given ok VS and no abnormalities on
exam, hemotoma has been stable. On CXR pt had retro-cardiac
opacity, given recent outbreak of RSV at nursing home, pt was
given Vanc/Cipro (HCAP).

On the floor, appears in NAD however does have swelling of the
lower lip, [**Last Name (un) 2599**] and eyes. Has difficulty pronouncing words

CXR [**2171-4-5**]:
There is severe cardiomegaly associated also with bilateral
hilar enlargement, findings that might be consistent with
complex valvular problems as well as cardiomyopathy. There are
most likely present bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
evidence of pulmonary edema. Calcified right pleural plaques are
redemonstrated. There is no evidence of pneumothorax

TTE [**2171-4-5**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Mild
functional mitral stenosis from annular calcification.

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo w/PMHx significant for HTN, CKD, CVA (hemiplegia in [**2155**]),
diastolic heart failure, HLD, PVD refered from [**Hospital 100**] rehab for
hypoxia after receiving IVF, along with tongue and lip swelling
for the last few days concerning for angioedema.

ANGIOEDEMA: the patient was seen by the allergy consult team
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2602**] [**Doctor Last Name 2603**]) who thought this was consistent with angioedema,
she was started on dexamethasone 4mg q8hrs and H2 blockers.  her
symptoms improved and she was sent to the regular medical wards
from the ICU.  Her steroids were tapered to 2mg po q8hrs on [**4-8**]
and stopped completely on [**4-9**].

PULMONARY EDEMA: She improved with blood pressure control.  Her
