Allergies:
Levaquin / Quinolones / Polysorbates

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
Left upper quadrant abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85 yo M with CAD, COPD on 2L home O2, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
HTN, multiple back surgeries who presents with severe upper
abdominal pain LUQ>RUQ. Per the patient's report, coroborated by
his wife his pain started Thursday at dinner and was sharp and
stabbing in nature, it was worsened by movement and inspiration,
and increased up to [**9-9**] over the last few days. He states it
was in the same place that he was punched in the stomach a month
ago by an aid at his nursing home.
.
Patient reports no associated fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, change in stool, blood in stool, or dark/tarry stool.
He denies cough or change in chronic SOB, but reported pain with
deep breaths in the ED which he denies on the floor.
.
In the ED, initial vs [**9-9**] pain 97.8 81 118/64 16 97% 4L NC.
In the ED he desatted to the high 80s off of O2 and was found to
have wheezes in all lung fields, JVP up to the jaw, and 3+
pitting edema bilaterally.  His abdomen was noted to be tense
and tender diffusely, worst in the LUQ.  The patient was given
Morphine 4 mg IV x 2 for pain, albuterol nebs, and Solumdedrol
125mg IV.  CXR showed low lung volumes and linear atelectasis,
CT chest that showed possible aspiration, low lung volumes,
atelectasis, poor bolus timing, no central or lobar PE. CT
abd/pelvis showed no acute process. EKG showed SR at 80 bpm,
RBBB, inferior Q waves, unchanged from prior.
.
On the floor, he is in no respiratory disress, says his
breathing is at his baseline.  He is c/o LUQ pain worsened by
leaning to his side.  He states that it occasionally radiates
around to the back.  He does not think anything releives it
including passing gas.  He states his last bowel movement was
yesterday, and it was normal and formed.  Careful review of his
[**Hospital1 1501**] notes reveal oxygen sats of 88-96 % on 2L, with baseline
wheezes and crackles.
.

Urine culture ([**2143-3-9**]): No growth
.
3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CXR ([**2143-3-9**]): Lung volumes are low and there is
associated linear subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases.
Mild central pulmonary vascular congestoin is likely present.
Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged. There is
no pleural effusion, pneumothorax. Lumbar spinal fixation
hardware is partially imaged. IMPRESSION: Mild congestion.
.
- CTA chest ([**2143-3-9**]) & CT abdomen ([**2143-3-9**]):
1. No acute aortic syndrome.
2. Suboptimal opacification of the pulmonary arterial tree,
permitting only confident exclusion of central and lobar
pulmonary embolus. Segmental and subsegmental evaluation is
limited.
3. Secretions in the left main stem bronchus, with dependent
opacity in the left base, suggesting possible aspiration.
Evolving infectious consolidation cannot be excluded.
4. Low lung volumes, with diffuse dependent atelectasis.
5. Bowing of the posterior tracheal wall, suggesting
tracheomalacia.
6. No acute intra-abdominal process or explanation for left
upper quadrant
pain.
7. Innumerable renal hypodensities, incompletely characterized
on this study, though grossly stable from prior examination in
[**2142-3-31**].
8. Extensive aortic and coronary atherosclerosis.
9. Healed sternal fracture, T6 compression fracture, status post
kyphoplasty, multiple rib fractures. Extensive posterior fusion
from T10 through L5 is also unchanged. There is a chronically
dislocated right femoral prosthesis.
.
- Abdominal plain film ([**2143-3-12**]): **** prelim read **** Dilater
loops of bowel consistent with ileus.
.
Pending labs on discharge (to be followed by outpatient PCP)
- Blood culture ([**2143-3-9**])


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo M with CAD, COPD on 2L home O2, tracheomalacia,
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's dementia, HTN, multiple back
surgeries, and hx of left stomach trauma, admitted to MICU
severe upper abdominal pain, now transferred to floor.
.
# LUQ Pain: Etiology most likely a combination of increased
abdominal distention from constipation (on chronic oxycodone)
and gas superimposed on known rib fractures. CT abdomen was
reassuring in that there is no evidence of splenic infarct,
bowel stranding to indicate AMI, gall stones, or pancreatitis.
Labs are reassuring for the lack of cholestasis, lipase
elevation or LFT elevation. Old rib fractures again seen.
Troponin peaked at 0.07 -> 0.03 without any signs to suggest
ACS. No PE or PNA on CTA. Abdominal plain film showed dilated
loops of bowel without signs of free air. Patient treated with
aggressive bowel regimen with passing of flatus and stool
throughout. Pain treated with tylenol and restarted on home
oxycodone dose prior to discharge.
.
# Hypoxia: Chronic issue with COPD and tracheomalacia. On 2L of
oxygen at home and saturation here ranged from 89-95%, similar
to baseline. Ruled out PE and pneumonia on CTA. Continued on
home nebs and PRN guaefenesin.
.
# Acute renal failure: On admission Cr elevated at 1.4 which
resolved after hydrat
