Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 23347**]
Chief Complaint:
LLQ abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
status post IR-guided embolization of the inferior epigastric
artery

History of Present Illness:
87 yo man with h/o pAFib on Coumadin, COPD (on 3L NC at home),
and CAD s/p CABG who presented to the ED from his nursing home
with LLQ abdominal pain and a supratherapeutic INR of 4.4. In
the ED, the patient had a CT scan of his abdomen, which
demonstrated a rectus sheath hematoma with evidence of active
extravasation into the retroperitoneum. His Hct on arrival to
the ED was 29.9, which was decreased from his baseline, so he
was transfused 1 unit blood and 2 units of FFP. He also received
Vitamin K and his repeat INR was 1.7.  Upon discussion with IR,
the patient was admitted to the SICU for observation overnight.
.
While in the ICU, the patient had an emergent IR-guided
embolization of the inferior epigastric artery on [**2172-5-15**]. He
was observed throughout the day, and he received a total of 7 [**Location 31200**] and 2 [**Location 16678**] to date during this hospital stay. His
Hct has remained stable throughout the day after his IR-guided
embolization. As his surgical issues are now stable, request was
placed for transfer to medicine.

CXR Portable [**5-17**]
FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
Bibasilar
patchy and linear areas of atelectasis are present. No areas of
airspace
consolidation are identified to suggest a source of infection
within the
lungs, but standard PA and lateral chest radiographs may be
helpful for more complete [**Month/Year (2) 2742**] when the patient's
condition permits.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left anterior abdominal wall hematoma with two distinct
areas of
active extravasation. Hematoma extends into retroperitoneal
space as well as into the subcutaneous tissues.
2. Ventral abdominal hernia containing nonobstructed loops of
bowel.


Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o male on coumadin for paroxsymal afib presents with rectus
sheath hematoma with RP extension s/p reversal of
anticoagulation and s/p angio embolizalization of left inferior
epigastric artery.
.
# rectus sheath hematoma: emergent IR-guided embolization of the
inferior epigastric artery on [**2172-5-15**]. He received a total of 7
[**Location **] and 2 [**Location 16678**] prior to transfer to the medical
service. On the medical floor, patient received 2 more units of
pRBC and his hematocrit was stable for 24 hours prior to
discharge. Aspirin and coumadin were initially held in setting
of active bleeding, but resumed once Hct was stable. Aspirin was
resumed but Coumadin should be resumed day after discharge on
[**5-21**].
.
# pAFib on Coumadin: p/w elevated INR and rectus sheath hematoma
with evidence of active extravasation into the retroperitoneum.
Aspirin and coumadin were initially held in setting of active
bleeding, but resumed once Hct was stable. Patient was continued
on home amiodarone dose and home lopressor was resumed and
changed to 25mg TID.
.
# Leukocytosis: no active signs/symptoms of infection. Felt to
be related to stress response as opposed to infection, given CXR
without infiltrate, U/A without signs of infection, and lack of
fever.
.
# COPD: on 3L NC at home. Stable. Continued prn nebulizers and
oxygen via NC.
.
# CAD s/p CABG and Unstable Angina: patient developed SSCP x 2
with dynamic EKG changes while on the medicine floor. Cardiology
was consulted, and etiology was felt to be demand ischemia in
setting of low Hct as opposed to plaque rupture. Per discussion
with cardiology and surgery, no plavix/heparin was initiated.
Patient was transfused to keep Hct > 30. Telemetry was without
events or arrhythmias. Patient was restarted on aspirin, BB,
statin. ECHO showed Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild basal left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved left ventricular systolic
function. Elevated PCWP.

.
# HTN: initially held antihypertensives in setting of bleeding,
but resumed on discharge.
.
# HLD: continued statin
.
# GERD: continued PPI
.
# CKD: baseline creatinine 1.5-2.1, currently at baseline.
.
# Pain: continued tylenol and ultram, morphine only for severe
breakthrough pain. Continued IS
.
# Elevated BG: continued QID fingersticks and ISS while in
house. Did not require significant doses, and does not need to
continue BG checks on discharge.
