History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 74 yo M with h/o papillary urothelial carcinoma s/p
resection BCG treatment in [**2125**] presents with chest pain.
.
The patient was in his usual state of health until around 2pm
today. He is in the process of selling his house and moving and
had been lifting and moving boxes today. He developed left sided
chest pain around 2pm and it occurred intermittently throughout
the day. Each episode lasted a few minutes at a time. The pain
is described as a "pressure" that is relieved with rest and
worsens with exertion. The pain did not radiate and he denies
SOB, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, nausea, palpitation,
pleurisy. He denied abdominal pain, numbness, tingling,
weakness. He denied pleuritic chest pain, LE edema or pain.
Around 6pm, he went to dinner with his son who recommended he go
to the [**Name (NI) **] given the persistence of his symptoms. He presented to
[**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], where initial vital signs were T- 97.9 HR- 74, BP
146/75, Resp: 17, SaO2 100% on RA. Exam there was non-focal. EKG
had Qs in septal leads and left axis deviation. He was found to
have troponin 0.149, so he was given full dose aspirin and
started on heparin with transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for ACS.
.
On arrival to the ED, vital signs were T- 97, BP- 63, BP-
134/78, RR- 20, SaO2- 100% on RA. The was continued on heparin
gtt and admitted to cardiology for further evaluation.
.
Currently, T- 98.7, BP- 142/84, HR- 64, RR- 18, SaO2- 100% on
RA. he is comfortable and reports his chest pain is much
improved. He says the pain is "barely noticable" and rates it as
a [**12-25**]. Denies shortness of breath, diaphoresis, dizziness, LH
or syncope.

Blood cultures 2/29 and [**2-14**] pending at discharge
.
EKG  [**2132-2-9**]  9:31:30 PM
Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2126-2-8**]
no change.
Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T
65	172	98	402/410	65	-18	63
.
CXR  [**2132-2-11**] 2:39 AM
Patient is rotated to the left, which should increase the
relative opacity of
the right hemithorax. Instead, there is greater density on the
left, which in
the presence of elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
presumably atelectasis.
Followup suggested to exclude effect of aspiration. Right lung
is clear. The
heart size is normal, and there is no appreciable pleural
abnormality.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAS [**2132-2-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1. There is no interstitial pulmonary abnormality. Bronchial and
parenchymal
changes in the left lower lobe accompanying small hiatus hernia
and areas of
esophageal distention suggest aspiration, and raise question of
esophageal
motility abnormality.
2. Coronary atherosclerosis.
3. Sternal demineralization, predominantly in the manubrium not
necessarily
pathologic should be interpreted in light of any other findings
that point to
osseous infiltration.
.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO [**2132-2-12**] at 2:38:20 PM
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 50-60%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular systolic function.
.
Sestamibi Stress ([**2132-2-14**])
patient exercised for 10 minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol (~ 5.2
METS),
representing a fair exercise tolerance for his age. The test was
stopped at an achieved submaximal target workload of 80%
age-predicted
HR max. No chest, neck, back, or arm discomforts were reported
by the
patient throughout the study. There were no significant ST
segment
changes throughout the study (normalization noted in lead V2
during
exercise). The rhythm was sinus with rare, isolated apbs and
vpbs
throughout the study. Appropriate blood pressure and heart rate
responses to exercise.
.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes to
achieved worload. Nuclear report sent separately.

INTERPRETATION:
Left ventricular cavity size is mildly enlarged.
Attenuation corrected resting and stress perfusion images reveal
uniform tracer
uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium.
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventr
