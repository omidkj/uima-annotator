Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20506**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cerebral angiogram

History of Present Illness:
per admitting resident:

74 year old man with PMH of L parietal stroke during
perioperative cardiac procedure 5 years ago, prostate ca s/p
radiation therapy, afib off coumadin for the past few days due
to
hematuria (INR subtherapeutic 1.2), hx a. comm aneurysm who p/w
status epilepticus.

Patient was well at barber shop at 2pm (baseline he is
independent, lives by himself). At 2:30pm he was noticed to have
dysarthria and soon after slumped on the floor, described to
have
right sided weakness by EMS report. On the floor he had GTC
seizure, he was given 2mg ativan and 5mg valium by EMS with no
significant response; BP 100/103 HR 100. On arrival at ED at 3pm
he was still seizing, described was tonic posture. BP 196/109 HR
106 Sat 100% on mask; he was intubated for airway protection and
received a bolus of propofol; his seizures were stopped. No
neurologic exam was documented before he was heavily sedated to
confirm right sided weakness reported by history. His BP dropped
down to SBP 80's and ED started him temporarily on phentanyl
gtt.
He was loaded with dilantin 1g.

Of note, his son reports that patient has had two seizures in
his
life; one of them when he had a stroke, perioperatively 5 years
ago and another one 2 years ago in the setting of hypertensive
encephalopathy.

Imaging:

MRI/A of brain:

IMPRESSION:

1. Loss of flow-related enhancement of the distal right
vertebral artery
extending into the basilar artery, with corresponding increased
T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity. The findings are concerning for a
high-grade versus complete stenosis of the basilar artery.

2. Old left parietal and temporal infarct, with a tiny focus of
decreased
diffusion along its anterior margin that may represent a tiny
acute component.

However, there is no other area of definite decreased diffusion,
with no
evidence of infarct in the brainstem.

3. Extensive white matter hyperintensity, some of which
correlates with the
chronic infarct, while the remainder is in a nonspecific
distribution, likely representing the sequela of chronic
microangiopathy given the patient's age.

4. Stable 1-2 mm anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

CXR - IMPRESSION: Multifocal lung opacities, the larger one is
located in the left upper lobe. This could be aspiration
pneumonia.

Cerebral Angiogram:

Prelim - flow through right vertebral and basilar, normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old man with PMH of L parietal stroke (perioperative
during AVR replacment [**2128**]), prostate ca s/p radiation therapy,
afib off coumadin for the past few days due to hematuria (INR
subtherapeutic 1.2), hx a. comm aneurysm, and two
previous episodes of seizures (first in the setting of his
stroke and second in the setting of hypertensive
encephalopathy), who was noted to have started talking
"gibberish and was confused" while getting a hair cut, attempted
to get out of chair but was unsteady with EMS called and noted
to slump to one side and have a "GTC" He was treated with
ativan/valim and transferred to ED at [**Hospital1 18**] where he was
intubated and had an episode of hypotension to 80s.  Patient was
admitted to Neurology service for further evaluation and
treatment.

1) Neuro:  He underwent a CT head revealing no new pathology and
EEG revealing mild encephalopathy.  He was loaded with Dilantin,
later converted to Keppra IV.  On HD#1 patient was noted to have
multiple episodes of low amplitude high frequency R > L
extremities shaking with extensor posturing.  Given clinical
concern for sz activity by the intensivist team, he was treated
with a total of 11mg of ativan. He did not have further seizures
on continuous EEG monitoring for the next two days.

Given being off anticoagulation, there was concern for an
embolic stroke, leading to a GTC.  He underwent an MRI/a of the
brain which showed a low flow at R vertebral and basilar, no
infarction in the brainstem and the old L parietal/temporal
infarct with chronic WMD. An urgent cerebral angiogram revealed
full flow in R vertebral and basilar arteries. At this time, he
was started on heparin gtt for atrial fibrillation.
Echocardiogram showed no evidence of an embolus.

Over HD#[**11-28**] patient was no
