Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
40-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
myxomatous. There is partial posterior mitral leaflet flail of
the P2 scallop. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. An
eccentric,anteriorly directed directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial
effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Unchanged left and right ventricular systolci function ((With
patient on epinephrine infusion)

2. An annuloplasty ring (Saddle Shaped) is present in the
mitralposition. Well seated and stable. Normal anterior and
posterior mitral leaflet motion.

3. MVA by PHT method = 1.45 cm2. PG =11 mm Hg. MG= 4 mm Hg

4. Trace AI and intact aorta

5. No other change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted following cath for IV heparin.  He was
brought to the Operating Room on [**2177-6-18**] where the patient
underwent Mitral Valve Repair (28mm St. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]), Maze and
Left Atrial Appendage Ligation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].   Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Heart rate was in the 50s initially, and
beta blocker was held.  The patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Heart rate would increase
to the 70s-80s and Sotalol was resumed.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  Lopressor was
started after he demonstrated stable vital signs on Sotalol for
24 hours.  Metformin was resumed and blood glucose remained well
controlled.  Coumadin was resumed, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will continue
to follow this after discharge.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
