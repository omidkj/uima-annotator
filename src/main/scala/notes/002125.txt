with substernal chest pain and ST elevation. Cardiac

Hyperlipidemia.
Myocardial infarction


Social History:
Non contributory.

Family History:
Gransfather with CAD, CVA multiple family members.

Physical Exam:
Admission physical exam was unremarkable. On discharge physical
exam he was afebrile, BP 116/64, HR 83 and regular, respiratory
rate 20, he was 91% saturated on room air. He was neurologically
intact. His lungs were clear to ausculatation bilaterally. On
cardiovascular exam, he had S1 s2 with no murmurs rubs or
gallops. His midsternal incision was clean dry and intact with
no redness swelling or drainage. His abdomen was slightly
distended. He had 1+ peripheral edema. His left lower extremity
SVG incision were clean dry and intact however ecchymotic.

[**2161-7-5**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated three
vessel coronary artery disease in this left dominant
circulation. The
LMCA was without angiographically apparent flow limiting diseae.
The LAD
had a 90% ostial stenosis followed by a 70% mid-vessel stenosis.
The D1
had a 60% stenosis. The LCX was a large dominant vessel without
flow
limiting disease through the AV groove or OM branches. The ramus

intermedius was a moderate-sized vessel with 80% stenosis. The
RCA was a
non-dominant vessel with a 60% stenosis at the origin.
2. Resting hemodyanamics from right heart catheterization
demonstrated
elevated right and left sided filling pressures (RVEDP=18mmHg
and mean
PCWP=23mmHg). Cardiac output and index were mildly depressed at
4.4
L/min and 2.2 L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography not performed to reduce contrast load.
4. Successful placement of intra-aortic ballon pump via the
right
femoral artery.

[**2161-7-5**] CXR
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Mediastinal
contour within normal limits.

[**2161-7-7**] CXR
Left apical pneumothorax status post removal of thoracic
catheter.

[**2161-7-6**] ECHO
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Resting regional
wall motion
abnormalities include anteroseptal/anterior/apical
akinesis/hypokinesis (views suboptimal). No definite apical
thrombus seen but cannot exclude. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35763**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-7-5**] for further
management of his myocardial infarction. A cardiac
catheterization was performed which revealed severe three vessel
disease and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed. Due to the
severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical revascularization and Mr. [**Known lastname 35763**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2161-7-5**], Mr.
[**Known lastname 35763**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 35763**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. His intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned and removed without complication. He was
then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. Mr.
[**Known lastname 35763**] was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His epicardial pacing wires
and chest tubes were removed per protocol. Mr. [**Known lastname 35763**] continued
to make steady progress and was discharged to his home on
postoperative day three. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
