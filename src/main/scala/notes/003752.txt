No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
100% occlusion of RCA s/p aspiration thrombectomy and Promus DES
to prox RCA; also with normal LMCA, 60% eccentric mid-distal
LAD, 70-80% mid long LCx lesion


History of Present Illness:
65yoM with NO h/o CAD but with active smoking, +FHx, and ? HL
who presented to [**Hospital6 10353**] after awakening with
substernal CP at 3am, radiating to both shoulders. He was unable
to get back to sleep, so eventually went to [**Hospital1 392**] at 9am. He
also reported some lightheadedness and SOB on the prior day, but
no CP.
.
There, EKG showed elevation in III with inferior Q waves, STD in
V2, and sub millimeter depressions in lateral/high lateral
leads. Cardiac enzymes and all other labs were pending there by
transfer here. There, he was given 325 ASA, Plavix 600 mg PO, 1
SL NTG, 1L NS, and 1mg Ativan. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
.
Here, he was taken to cath lab and found to have 100% proximal
RCA culprit lesion and had aspiration thrombectomy followed by
DES (2.5 x 15 Promus) to prox RCA with post-dilation, no
residual stenosis, and TIMI 3 flow to distal vessel. Also noted
to have normal LMCA, 60% eccentric mid-distal LAD, 70-80% mid
long LCx lesion. He had R radial approach.
.
On arrival to CCU, pt is currently resting comfortably with
stable hemodynamics and Integrilling running. ROS reviewed, as
above o/w negative, pt was in good health, working, etc. Denied
any CP, decrease in exercise tolerance, orthopnea, SOB, syncope,
leg swelling.

Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe 2 vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal. The mid
LAD had a
60% eccentric lesion. The mid LCX had a long 70-80% lesion. The
dominant
RCA was 100% occluded proximally.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful thrombectomy and PCI of the proximal RCA with
Promus DES.
4. Terumo band to the right radial artery.
5. No complications of the procedure .

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease (RCA, LCX).
2. Acute inferior STEMI, managed by acute PTCA of the culprit
lesion.
3. Successful thrombectomy and PCI of the proximal RCA with a
2.5x15mm
Promus DES.
4. Aspirin 325mg/day for one month, followed by 81mg/day
indefinitely.
5. Plavix (clopidogrel) 75mg/day for 12 months.
6. Consideration of PCI of the LCX with residual ischemia.

.
Echo: [**2155-7-31**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis (see diagram).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with focal basal free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yoM with no prior cardiac history but with long smoking
history, family history, and possible hyperlipidemia but no
known HTN, DM who is admitted to CCU after inferior STEMI now
s/p aspiration thrombectomy and DES applied to proximal RCA with
good flow afterwards.
.
1. Inferior STEMI: Pt presented with trop 2.49, ekg showed
elevation in III with inferior Q waves, STD in V2, and sub
millimeter depressions in lateral/high lateral leads.  Pt went
for emergent cath, and had DES put in prox RCA with improved
flow afterwards.  He was given integrillin for 18hrs post cath
and started on ASA 325 for one month and then will transition to
81mg daily, plavix daily for one year, lisinopril 5mg daily,
atorvastatin 80 mg daily and metoprolol XR 25mg daily.  He
remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the
floor. Post-cath echo showed: mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior/inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis with EF of 45%.  He was monitored on
telemetry with no events.  PT evaluated pt and determined that
he was safe to go home with no needs for acute rehab.  He was
counseled on lifestyle changes and demonstrated good
understanding.  Pt will need repeat echo in one month and close
PCP/cards follow up.
