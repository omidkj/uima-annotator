Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgery Service on the
Intensive Care Unit.  A local incision and drainage of the wound
was performed at the bedside, and 20cc of fluid aspirated
superficially. She remained in the ICU for close monitoring of
her meningeal signs (nucchal rigidity), and her fever and
elevated WBC count.  On the morning of HD3, she had been
afebrile for over 24 hours, and her WBC count began to trend
downwards. She was transferred to the step down unit. Pain
control was an issue for the patient, as she had been on
percocet for years and developed a high pain tolerance.  Once
transferred to the stepdown patient continued to have severe
pain, a lumbar MRI was performed which showed a subcutaneious
fluid collection extending to the epidural space,  pt. was
subsequently taken to the OR for a washout of the lumbar wound,
a Pin rose drain was paced for continours drainage and was
removed on POD #2.

Pt. was cleared to go home after being afebrile for 24hrs. She
will continue to be followed by Infectious Disease and have
ongoing antibiotic therapy with Penicillin G for 6 weeks. Weekly
labs will be reviewed by ID. we will see the patient back in 3
weeks for suture removal and wound check.
