Aspirin / Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Right Craniotomy for SDH
2. Gastric tube placement
3. Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
80 year-old woman with a past medical history significant for
emphasema, hypertension, and recent subdural hematoma s/p right
craniotomy who was transferred to the medicine intensive care
unit from the neurosurgery service for respiratory distress.
.
The patient was admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] as transfer from OSH with new
right subdural hematoma and left hemiparesis discovered after
the patient was found unresponsive at her [**Hospital3 **]
facility. The patient was intubated at the OSH, then admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] [**7-13**], and underwent an emergent right craniotomy for SDH
evacuation. The patient was able to be extubated [**7-15**]. The
patient underwent a hiatal hernia repair and g-tube placement
[**2153-7-18**]. Tube feeds were started [**7-19**].  After starting G-tube
feeds and being positive 1.5L, the patient was found to be in
respiratory distress with thick white secretions suctioned. The
patient endorsed a cough. At the time she was afebrile, BPs
120-130/60-70, tachycardic 100-110s, RR 30, O2 sat 98% 35%
shovel mask. Patient was evaluated by MICU who felt her
respiratory distress was likely due to volume overload. The
patient was given 20mg lasix iv, then another 20mg lasix iv with
minimal improvement in respiratory function. Patient continued
to be tachypneic and was transferred to the medicine intensive
care unit team.
.
On presentation to T-SICU, temp 99.1, HR 120s, BP 119/57, RR 39,
O2sat 99% FM 15L. Patient was felt to still be volume overloaded
and in failure. BNP from am labs prior to transfer was 2161.
Patient was trialed on CPAP in an attempt to avoid intubation.
Patient respiratory rate fell to low 30s, and her use of
accessory muscles also decreased. The patient's blood pressure
dropped to 107/47, and her oxygenation was in the 80s. Patient
was somnulent, reported beign short of breath, denied any chest
pain or abdominal pain. The patient was intubated. The patient
was then transferred to MICU 6 for continued care.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT([**7-13**])
FINDINGS: There is a large hyperdense subdural hematoma with
areas of
isodensity layering over the right cerebral convexity measuring
approximately 1 cm in greatest diameter. There is shift of the
normally midline structures by 10 mm (2, 15) indicating
subfalcine herniation. There is mild effacement of the right
lateral ventricle with expansion of the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
concerning for trapped left ventricle. The quadrigeminal and
suprasellar cisterns are patent. Extensive calcifications of the
basal ganglia are noted bilaterally. Extensive periventricular
white matter hypodensities are noted and consistent with chronic
small vessel ischemic changes. A large amount of soft tissue
swelling is seen over the left periorbital soft tissues (2, 10)
and over the left calvarium. There is no evidence of acute
fracture. There is
opacification of the sphenoid sinus, left greater than right and
minimal
opacification of the left maxillary sinus.

Head CT([**7-14**])->Post-evac
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval right frontal
craniotomy with evacuation of the previously seen right subdural
hematoma. Post-operative pneumocephalus overlying both frontal
convexities of the small amount of residual high-density
subdural blood is apparent. There is also a new focus of either
intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the right temporal lobe,
measuring 2.5 x 1.8 cm (2:7) - previously there was a small
amount of blood products in this region and this new finding may
represent blooming of a contusion. There is decreased shift of
the normally midline structures, with now 6 mm of leftward
midline shift (previously 10 mm). The ventricular size is stable
and there is no evidence of intraventricular blood. Extensive
periventricular hypoattenuation consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemic disease is unchanged. Basal ganglia
calcifications noted. There remains moderate opacification of
the sphenoid sinuses and ethmoid air cells. There is also new
orbital emphysema seen anterior and medial to the left globe.
Soft tissue swelling overlying the craniotomy site is within
normal post-operative limits.

Head CT [**7-15**]:
1. Interval increase in right inferior temporal parenchymal
contusion as well as slight increase in the right frontoparietal
extra-axial collection.
2. Stable degree of shift of the septum pellucidum.
3. Persistent orbital emphysema. The integrity of the orbital
wall is better assessed in the dedicated sinus CT.
.
Head CT [**7-27**]
1. Stable right subdural hematoma and right temporal parenchymal
contusion
with slight decrease in mass effect.
2. Resolving left temporal subdural hematoma.
3. Opacification of the sphenoid sinuses and mastoid air cells
most likely
due to intubation.
.

C-Spine CT([**7-13**])
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture. Severe degenerative
changes of
the cervical spine.

X-rays Lt Wrist([**7-13**])
FINDINGS: There is soft tissue irregularity and gas seen along
the dorsum of the hand. No radiopaque foreign densities are
seen. There are no signs for acute fractures. There is an old
healed fracture deformity of the fifth metacarpal. Degenerative
changes are seen, most prominent within the PIP joint of the
long finger, first IP and first CMC joint.

CT sinus/max/[**Last Name (un) **]:
1. Persistent intraorbital extraconal air, which could be
secondary to tiny nondisplaced superior orbital fracture.
2. Slight increase in right extra-axial collection as well as
right inferior frontal lobe parenchymal hemorrhagic contusion.
3. Redemonstration of mastoid air cells opacification as well as
fluid levels in the sphenoid sinus.

CT abd:
1. Relatively large hiatal hernia, which contains fundus and
proximal portion of the stomach. As the GE junction is not
visualized on this study, it is not clear whether this hernia is
a paraesophageal or a sliding type.
2. Chronic wedge compression fracture of the L3, T12, T11, and
T10.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectases.
4. Acute fractures of the left 10th rib.
.
CXR [**7-30**] -
There are low inspiratory volumes, lower than on [**2153-7-28**].
Otherwise, I doubt
significant interval change. Cardiomediastinal contours are
stable. There
