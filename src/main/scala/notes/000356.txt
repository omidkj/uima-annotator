None.

History of Present Illness:
(ACOVE transfer note from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**])

The pt is a 27 y.o. female with interstitial lung disease status
post open lung biopsy on [**2160-10-8**], on chronic TPN for GI
dysmotility, suprapubic catheter for bladder atony who presented
to the ED with a two-day history of fevers to 101 F. She also
complained of chills, increased abdominal pain, nausea without
vomiting, bladder spasm, and mild headache.  In ER her T was
101.4, HR 112, BP 95/69, RR 24 and she was 95% on 2L.  Labs were
notable for a lactate of 2.4, alkpho of 161 aa WBC of 3.6 with
N89.  Patient was empirically started on Vanc, Flagyl,
Levofloxacin, Linezolid for urosepsis vs. line sepsis.  An
abdominal CT demonstrated a non-loculated pelvic fluid
collection for which surgery was following.  One set of blood
cultures grew coag negative staphylococcus, and antibiotics were
transitioned to Vancomycin. The patient's blood pressure
responded to fluids and antibiotics and her temperature
normalized.

Of note the patient came with a history of vasculitis documented
by report from her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16004**] on colectomy specimen
many years ago.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16004**] reports the initial pathology was
done at [**Hospital6 4620**] and then reviewed a second
time at [**Hospital 4415**].

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] referred her for a lung biopsy because patient she
had had
a previous lung biopsy which was "concerning for a diffuse
microthrombotic process without much in the way of inflammatory
infiltrates" as well as four months of progressive pulmonary
deterioration for which a course of IV salumedrol was tried.
Biopsy performed [**10-8**] showed no vasculitis/no amyloid.

On transfer to medical floor patient reported feeling weak, with
no change in her baseline shortness of breath, no diarrhea, no
fever or chills, no chest pain. She reported not ambulating at
baseline secondary to contractures in her legs.  She reported
bloating in her stomach with some nausea but no emesis. She
denied photobia, cough, chills, neck stiffness, jaundice.


Past Medical History:
1. Neuropathic vasculitis. See note from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6426**] of
Rheumatology on [**2155-11-17**] in OMR for complete details.
Diagnosed at the age of 13. The exact nature of the
vasculitis has not been completely characterized. Has been
on brief courses of steroids in the past. Status post
multiple organ biopsies including muscle, skin, liver, and
bowel demonstrating perivasculitis.
2. Gastrointestinal dysmotility syndrome diagnosed in [**2144**],
status post subtotal colectomy in [**2147**] with result in short
gut syndrome, on total parenteral nutrition via central line
since [**2148**].
3. Multiple central line infections including Staphylococcus
epidermidis, [**Female First Name (un) 564**], and Klebsiella.
4. Right internal jugular central line thrombosis in [**5-/2159**],
status post TPA therapy.
5. Interstitial pattern on chest x-ray, etiology unclear,
status post VATS. Biopsy showed organizing and organized
arterial thrombi with recanalization, patchy eosinophilic
inflammatory infiltrate extending into the pulmonary
arteries, patchy pulmonary scarring, and no evidence of
vasculitis. No exact diagnosis could be made. Pulmonary
function tests [**2159-5-14**] suggests a restrictive defect, no
lung volume is recorded.
6. Status post cholecystectomy in [**2149**].
7. Question of [**Doctor Last Name **] optic atrophy.
8. Anemia of chronic disease status post multiple blood
transfusions.
9. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy with chronic pain.
10. Bladder atony status post suprapubic catheter placement
in [**2150**].
11. History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
12. Status post dental extraction.
13. Status post left salpingo-oophorectomy.
14. History of Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in urine.
15. Status post G-J tube placement in the past.
16. Status post multiple vascular stents right IJ, left
brachiocephalic, left iliac veins.
17. Eosinophilic pneumonia- the possibility of chemical irritant
exposure through intravenous injection was raised on her last
admission.

Pertinent Results:
RUQ ([**11-3**]) IMPRESSION: The hepatic veins are patent. Portal
vein pulsatility suggests right hepatic failure.

[**2160-11-3**] chest CT
1. The liver is enlarged and heterogeneous. This could be due to
edema. The
hepatic veins are not opacified with intravenous contrast which
could be due
to technical reasons, however due to the congestive appearance
of the
parenchyma this is concerning for Budd- Chiari syndrome.
Recommend ultrasound
of the liver with doppler for better evaluate.

2. Diffuse edema of the soft tissues.

3. Small amount of free fluid in the abdomen. There is a
partially loculated
fluid collection in the left pelvis. However, the fact that the
walls are not
enhancing suggests this is probably not an abscess.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure

IMPRESSION:
1.  Stable interstitial pattern of opacity, in keeping with
known history of
vasculitis.  Other inflammatory processes and mild interstitial
edema cannot
be excluded.
2.  Lucency of the distal clavicle with possible distal
clavicular fracture.
Dedicated radiograph of the clavicle are suggested if clinically
warranted.
