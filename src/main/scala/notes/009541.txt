Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, transferred from outside
hospital


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Tracheostomy
PEG tube placement
IVC filter placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year old right-handed man with past medical
history of coronary artery disease status post inferior MI,
catheratization in [**10-19**] with mild LAD disease, history of
pulmonary embolus, history of DVT while on heparin SC so now on
life long coumadin, presumed Strep pneumoniae meninigitis [**12-19**]
with ? symptomatic seizures who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**2161-5-2**] at 5pm as a transfer from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for
evaluation of left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

He was in his usual state of health until earlier today. Per his
wife, he went to get a haircut this morning and returned home at
noon. When he went to talk to his wife, his words came out as
gibberish. The words themselves were not slurred but it was like
he was using totally inappropriate words. He seemed frustrated
to
her. She did not note any facial or limb weakness.

She drove him by car to [**Hospital 1562**] hospital. He walked into the
hospital of his own [**Location (un) **]. Head CT showed a left temporal lobar
hemorrhage, widest diameter of 2.5 cm present on three 5 mm
cuts.
His INR was 2.5. He received Vitamin K and 4 units of FFP. After
the fourth unit of FFP, he developed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] red rash over his
entire body. An additional two units of FFP had been ordered but
were held due to concern for transfusion reaction.

On arrival here, he was bradycardic to the 30s with a 208/79. He
was examined here off of sedation and was noted to move all
extremities symmetrically. While in [**Hospital1 18**] ED, received 50 mg
Benadryl IV (for rash), was bolused with Propofol and started on
Propofol drip, and loaded with 1 gram of IV Dilantin. For repeat
of INR 1.8, he was ordered for another 2 units FFP after getting
Solumedrol 125 mg IV and Pepcid 20 mg IV.

He was seen by Neurosurgery who felt that surgical intervention
was not warranted at this time.

Per his wife, he had had no complaints in the days leading up to
today's event.

CT without contrast [**5-2**]
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is a focal rounded area of hyperattenuation
measuring 2.5 x 2.3 cm in the left frontoparietal region
consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, relatively
unchanged in appearance from the outside films. There is a thin
hypodense halo consistent with surrounding edema. There is no
evidence of mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. Note is made of extensive mucosal thickening within
the visualized maxillary and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally. The
mastoid air cells are well aerated. Bone windows demonstrate no
evidence of acute fracture or osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION: 2.5 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left
frontoparietal region with associated edema. No evidence of
hydronephrosis, midline shift or mass effect. Extensive mucosal
thickening within the visualized portions of the paranasal
sinuses as described above.

CT with contrast [**5-2**]
CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with multiplanar reformatted images.

PRELIMINARY REPORT: Exam is extremely technically limited by
suboptimal contrast bolus. Within the limits of the study, the
major vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appear patent. There is a
dominant left vertebral artery. Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage
is again seen. Full [**Location (un) 1131**] to follow after post-processed
images are acquired. Wet [**Location (un) 1131**] to CCC at 9:50 p.m. on
[**2161-5-2**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], pager [**Numeric Identifier 21129**].

FINDINGS: Study is extremely limited by suboptimal contrast
bolus, which precludes evaluation of the intracranial
circulation. No gross abnormalities are identified. There is a
dominant left vertebral artery, with a possible posterior
inferior cerebellar artery termination of the right vertebral
artery. If clinically warranted, a repeat study could be
performed for further evaluation.

IMPRESSION: Limted study secondary to suboptimal contrast bolus.
Grossly normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with no large aneurysm.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist
