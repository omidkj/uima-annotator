Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI; ASA desensitization prior to cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2105-3-16**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year-old female with a history of non ischemic
dilated cardiomyopathy EF 20-25% followed by [**Hospital **] clinic at
[**Hospital1 756**] who was admitted to NEBH 3/309 with progressively
worsening SOB since [**2104-12-8**], diaphoresis and chest pain.
She was found to be in heart failure with elevated BNP and ruled
in for NSTEMI with troponin I 5.97 peak, CK 212, CKMB 5.1 index
2.4. She was diuresed, started on nitro gtt and heparin gtt and
underwent cardiac cath [**2105-3-13**] with 2VD with 50% proximal and 50%
mid LAD stenosis as well as 70-80% stenosis distal RCA. Heparin
gtt d/c'd at 0800. Due to reaction of anaphylaxis with ASA she
was transferred here for ASA desensitization and PCI. She report
continued SOB and diaphoresis which has been present since
[**Month (only) 1096**] and was precipitaed by flu like illness. She denies any
current chest pain buit has had intermittent epigastric
discomfort typically relieved with maalox. She reports
exertional dyspnea, PND, orthopnea. Symptoms have been
progressive x months but acutely worsened 1 week prior to
transfer one day after lasix dose decreased from 80 [**Hospital1 **] to daily
ad dig stopped [**2-9**] concern for dig toxicity. ALso has had
dietary indiscretion with poor PO intake but eating low sodium
soup and saltines.
.
Echo at OSH: LV markedly dilated, severe global HK, EF 20-25%,
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7151**] dilated, RV mildly enlarged, RV fxn mildly impaired,
RA mildly enlarged, Moderate MR, Mild-mod TR, small left pleural
effusion.

On review of systems, report subjective fevers, diaphoresis,
decreased PO intake, nausea and vomiting. Denies diarrhea, SOB,
CP, palpitations.

Reports/Imaging
ECG [**2105-3-13**]: Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial enlargement.
Occasional ventricular ectopy.  Left ventricular hypertrophy.
Right axis deviation. Downsloping ST segment depression and T
wave inversion in leads V4-V6 which may be left ventricular
hypertrophy related. Lateral ischemia cannot be excluded. No
previous tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation
of the right axis deviation and ST-T wave changes is suggested.


CXR [**2105-3-14**]: REASON FOR EXAM: 59-year-old woman with CHF admitted
with shortness of breath and chest pain, please evaluate for
infiltrate or effusion.
Since [**2102-2-13**], moderate left and small right pleural
effusions are new with bibasilar opacity, likely atelectasis.
Heart size is difficult to assess. There are no signs of edema.
Scoliosis is unchanged.
.
Cardiac cath [**2105-3-16**] COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed two vessel CAD.  The
LM was angiographically normal. The LCX was angiographically
normal.  The LAD had a mid 70-80% hazy lesion and the mid-distal
LAD had a 70% lesion.  The RCA had moderate diffuse distal
disease but the discrete lesion seen on Friday was clearly no
longer evident.  There was evidence of distal embolization with
slow flow in RPL.
2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 83/55 with HR 83 in sinus.  We
gave
500cc NS bolus.  Right heart cath was deferred.
3. Stenting of LAD with Vision 3x8 and 3x12mm bare metal stents.

4. Groin closure with Mynx device
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe cardiomyopathy with EF 20% and cardiac index 1.3 on
Friday
3. NSTEMI involving RCA territory.
4. Stenting of LAD.

Echo [**2105-3-17**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the entire
interventricular septum and inferior free wall and severe
hypokinesis of the anterior free wall and apex. The posterior
wall contracts normally and the lateral wall is only mildly
hypokinetic. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve
leaflets do not fully coapt due to posterior and apical
tethering of the leaflets. An eccentric, posteriorly directed
jet of
