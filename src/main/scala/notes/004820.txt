premedullary and right lateral medullary cisterns.

other cervical
arterial dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o F s/p WHOL after working out at the gym. She was taken to
OSH where head CT revealed a perimesincephalic SAH. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical evaluation. Once
at the [**Hospital1 **], patient had a CTA of the head that showed no
aneurysm. Patient remained neurologically intact. On [**10-14**],
repeat head CT showed stable SAH with no hydrocephalus. She was
taken to for a cerebral angiogram for confirmation and was
negative for aneurysm or other vascular anomalies.

On [**10-15**] a MRI/A of the cervical spine was performed to rule out
a vascular anomaly and was negative. Patient remained in the
ICU.

On [**10-17**] A CTA of the head was performed to r/o vasospasm which
was negative. She was subsequently transferred to the SD unit.

She did well on the floor, but mostly had difficulties with
lower back pain which ultimately responded to a combination of
NSAIDs and valium. Her headaches were controlled with fioricet-
and similar agents.

Following a repeat angiogram on [**10-20**] which was normal, she
was discharged to home the next day with instructions to follow
up in one month with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. A referral was placed for the
patient to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in clinic.
