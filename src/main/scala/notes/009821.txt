Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, fever

Paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 58F w/ HCV cirrhosis and HCC s/p Cyberknife who
initially presented to the ED on [**2-22**] w/ generalized malaise,
increasing DOE, and low-grade fever. Since then she has had a
complicated course including several MICU stays for SOB at times
requiring BiPAP, ultimately requiring urgent intubation on the
medical floor on [**3-31**] for resp failure and somnolence thought [**1-29**]
hypercarbic resp failure. Of note, she was also hypotensive
requiring levophed on [**4-19**]. The pt was extubated on [**4-5**]. She
has had multiple ID issues and has been followed by ID
consultants. She has been treated for MRSA PNA, Klebsiella UTI,
candidemia (c. dubliniensis) from bld cx on [**3-8**], Zoster
diagnosed [**3-29**]. The pt finished the last course of abx on [**4-6**]
and is now off all abx.
.
She was last called out of the MICU on [**4-8**] and has since
developed hypernatremia. She complained of some shortness of
breath beyond her baseline the evening of [**4-9**]; her ABG was
7.4/45/95. This evening she again complained of shortness of
breath although she was noted by the floor night float residents
to be appearing somewhat more alert and in less distress than on
[**4-9**]. Her ABG was 7.28/71/60. She had been started on IVF during
the day and the thought was that she may have had some fluid
overload. She was given Lasix 20mg IV x 1. Repeat ABG ~30-45
minutes later was 7.28/67/194 on 5L NC. She was transferred to
the MICU for further monitoring of her respiratory status.
.
Currently, she states she feels somewhat more short of breath.
She denies chest pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
She has a persistent productive but weak cough.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58F with HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and COPD, admitted with
multifocal pneumonia, s/p multiple MICU stays, now going home
with hospice care.
.
## Respiratory distress, hypercarbia: Bilateral pleural
effusions likely contributing most to chronic dyspnea. ABG
indicates mostly compensated chronic respiratory acidosis,
likely from hypoventilation, especially given methadone. Given
her history of COPD, she may have been receiving more O2 than
necessary, further depressing her respiratory drive. Pt is
baseline tachypneic and is not in enough respiratory distress to
warrant intubation at this time. Bilateral pleural effusions
could also easily be hiding new pneumonia vs. tracheobronchitis.
Given junky lung exam, initial low pO2 may have been mucous
plugging.  During her hospiotalization she was intubated three
times for respiratory distress. She had several bouts of
ventilator associated pneumonia and sepsis requiring pressors,
sputum positive for MRSA. A tracheostomy was considered. Final a
decision was made given overal poor prognosis to pursue hospice
care.

.
## Endstage liver disease - From hepatitis C. Now with
hepatocellular carcinoma. Not a transplant candidate. Going home
with hospice.

.
.
## h/o substance abuse
-- restart methadone slowly
