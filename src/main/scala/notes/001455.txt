Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2006**]
Chief Complaint:
Hip pain/fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2147-4-17**] Open reduction internal fixation of the left hip


History of Present Illness:
70 yo W w/ refractory Crohn's disease s/p total
colectomy/ileostomy, short gut syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis on
prednisone, PEs in [**2144**] (on coumadin), osteoporosis and falls
who was admitted to medical service s/p fall on [**4-16**], found to
have left intertrochanteric hip fracture and s/p intramedullary
nailing with cephalomedullary
system today, post op developed hypotension/resp. distress felt
to be due to mucous plug, requiring reintubation, now
re-extubated and admitted to MICU for persistent tachycardia and
hypoxia.
.
Patient had a mechanical fall on [**4-16**] in setting of increased
sedating medications (gabapentin), initially evaluated at OSH,
where she was found to be in moderate pulmonary edema.  On
arrival to [**Hospital1 **], was found to have a Leukocytosis 12K (felt to be
reactive) but was started on Cipro/Flagyl in case GI source and
given 3mg of Vitamin K.
.
Has had progressively worsening dyspnea for months, attributed
ILD and CHF?  She is on coumadin for recurrent DVTs.
.
Post-op, post extubation, noted to be tachypneic w/ O2 sats in
80s, HE in 140s and BP in 150s w/o significant improvement on
NRB, thus was reintubated.  Bronch -> mucus plug, suctioned, VBG
7.18/57/49. After 2 hrs, noted to have improving MS and O2 sats,
was thus extubated at 1300.  Weaned to 3L NC, however, remained
tachycardic in 120-130 sinus with SBP 90/50s (pre-op BPs in
110-130s) and oliguria.  She was treated with 1U PRBCs, 5.5 L NS
total, UOP improved to 30cc/hr (prior < 10cc/hr).  In addition
to above, pt. received 10mg of esmolol for NSVT on tele w/ SBP
to 80s transiently, Flagyl 250mg, Prednisone 5mg, Coumadin 5mg,
Dilaudid 0.6mg and APAP 1g.  Given persistent tachycardia and
hypotension, transferred to MICU.
