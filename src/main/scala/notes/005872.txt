Allergies:
Morphine / Asacol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrophysiology Study with Ablation of 1 of 2 Foci


History of Present Illness:
82 y/o male with CAD s/p CABG, hypertension, CHF EF 35%, atrial
fibrillation, and sustained VT with ICD and subsequent catheter
ablation treatment who presents following an episode of ICD
firing earlier today at home. The patient was at home the day of
presentation watching television when he suddenly became
lightheaded and diaphoretic and his ICD fired. He states that he
had similar symptoms when his ICD fired in the past. His last
episode of ICD firing was in early [**10-11**] and was admitted to the
hospital.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 95.1 HR: 120 BP: 121/79 RR: 16

O2Sat: 97% on 4LNC. EP was called and he was found to be in slow
VT. He received an amiodarone bolus and was started on a gtt.
Plans were made for cardioversion and he received etomidate.
However, the slow VT was able to be broken via antitachycardia
pacing. He was also loaded with Plavix, given 80 mg of
atrovastatin PO x 1, and a heparin gtt was started with concern
for possible ACS.


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post IMI and coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2121**].

Family History:
Father had a "leaky valve." The patient's mother had
hypertension.

CXR [**11-27**]: Stable cardiomegaly with no acute pulmonary process.

ECHO [**11-28**]: The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction (35-40%) with inferior
akinesis/dyskinesis and inferolateral akinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-9-27**],
findings are similar. Left ventricular systolic function appears
similar.

US [**11-28**]:
Findings are compatible with the arteriovenous fistula at the
puncture site.

US [**11-30**]:
1. No AV fistula or psueudoaneurysm.
2. Small right groin hematoma.

US [**12-1**]:
Previously demonstrated AV fistula appears to have resolved.
There is now no evidence of fistula or pseudoaneurysm


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 82 year old male with CAD s/p CABG and
multiple MIs, HTN, CHF EF 35%, afib, and sustained VT with ICD
and subsequent catheter ablation treatment who presents with an
episode of ICD firing, found to be in slow VT.

# CAD - The patient has a history of CAD with multiple MIs, but
had no signs of active ACS while hospitalized (cardiac enzymes
negative x 3, EKGs without changes). Pt was maintained on his
[**Hospital 3782**] medical regimen, with switch of hydralazine to ace
inhibitor. Pt maintained his baseline normal renal function
after initiating ACE inhibitor and was monitored carefully given
his prior history of ARF on ACEi.

# [**Name (NI) **] - Pt remained euvolemic, with a known baseline LVEF of
35%.

# Rhythm - Pt presented after ICD firing and was found to be in
slow VT in the ED. He was able to be paced out of VT, received a
bolus of amiodarone, was started on a gtt, and eventually
transitioned to an oral amiodarone regimen. Pt underwent
ablation, with success in 1 of 2 foci. Pt's pacer setting was
changed to Anti-Tachycardia Pacing at 122bpm, and his
beta-blocker was titrated up. Pt was monitored on telemetry with
no additional arrhythmias.

# Groin bleed - Pt's ablation was complicated by a bleed after
removal of the venous and arterial sheaths. Pt developed a new
bruit which was evaluated by a femoral ultrasound. This showed
an AV fistula, in the setting of INR 2 and PTT 78. Vascular
surgery was consulted and did not feel surgical intervention was
necessary unless pt developed uncontrollable bleeding,
hypoperfusion to the extremity or high output heart failure. Pt
did not develop any of these complications, maintained a stable
Hct for several days and on reevaluation by ultrasound had
resolution of the AV fistula.

# Hypertension - Continue home meds. No active issues.

# History of Atrial fibrillation - Pt remained in sinus rhythm
thoughout admission. His coumadin was held given the ablation,
and not restarted in the setting of groin bleed/ AV fistula.
Upon resolution of these issues, pt was restarted on
anticoagulation with Lovenox bridge to be administered by VNA,
and INR follow up.

# h/o DVT - Pt was prophylaxed with pneumoboots while
anticoagulation was held.
