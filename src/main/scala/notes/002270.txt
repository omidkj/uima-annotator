History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with h/o asthma, OSA, pulmonary HTN, HTN, and DM who
woke up yesterday morning feeling like he was getting a cold. He
says he felt similar to how he did prior to his last admission.
He has been feeling chills, tired, and short of breath. He has
had one day of non-productive cough. He has not had any sick
contacts. [**Name (NI) **] has been taking all of his medications and tried to
use his inhalers with no improvement in his symptoms. He uses
his oxygen intermittently during the day but does use his bipap
at night. According to his wife he has been more disoriented for
the last 2 days. He states he has not had any increased edema
recently but his wife says he seems to be more swollen to her.
He denies orthopnea, PND, no increased salt intake recently. He
has not had any recent chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or
abdominal pain. He has not had any urinary pain, frequency or
urgency.
.
In the ED he was found to have an O2sat in the 60s. He was
placed on a NRB and had intermittant hypoxia to the 70s, then
improved to the 90s. He was treated with Combivent nebulizer,
Solumedrol, Lasix 20mg IV X2, and Levofloxacin 750mg IV X1.
.
He was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 756**] ICU for respiratory
failure secondary to presumed viral pneumonia. He has been seen
frequently in pulmonary clinic and has had an increasing O2
requirement.


Past Medical History:

Past Medical History:
1. Asthma, pulmonary HTN, and severe OSA at home on 3L at
baseline and 4L with exertion, according to him his home sat is
92-95%, previously trached.
2. HTN
3. DM
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. PUD
6. CHF - diastolic heart failure (documented on Echo in [**2192**])


Social History:
Social history: Lives with his wife, used to work in Demolition,
Never smoked, no EtOh, no IVDU

Family History:
Family history: Father had an MI at 49, Mother with MI at 44,
Brother with MI at 75

Physical Exam:
VS: Temp 98.0, Pulse 90, BP 139/75, RR 29, 89% on 50% FM
Gen: alert, oriented, cooperative male in mild respiratory
distress, not using accessory muscles
HEENT: MMM, OP clear, PERRL
Neck: JVD at 5cm above sternoclavicular notch, no
lymphadenopathy
Lungs: Crackles bilaterally at the bases, no wheezing
CV: decreased cardiac sounds, nl S1S2, no murmer
Abd: obese, non-tender, non-distended, positive BS
Ext: 2+ edema on left, 1+ edema on right
Neuro: grossly intact


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:  CXR [**6-16**]
Mild interstitial edema and moderate cardiomegaly are stable.
Lung volumes remain quite low, so that focal opacification at
the right lung base could be either atelectasis or pneumonia.
Region of right juxtahilar previously questioned as pneumonia on
[**6-14**] is no longer present and may have been fissural pleural
effusion, since at least a small right pleural effusion is
present.  ET tube is in standard placement and a nasogastric
tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
.
Echo [**2194-6-10**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue  Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic  regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is no systolic anterior motion of the  mitral
valve leaflets. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial  effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved left ventricular function and suggestion of increased
left ventricular filling pressures. Inability to fully visualize
right ventricle due to suboptimal image quality.
.
[**2194-6-18**]:
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2194-6-17**], 15:50 p.m. New
right PICC is seen looping in the axillary vein and terminating
at approximately the junction of the axillary and subclavian
veins. No pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube and nasogastric tube
remain in place. Low lung volumes and an improving appearance of
pulmonary vascular congestion. Left lower lobe atelectasis
remains. Please note that the left extreme costophrenic angle
was excluded from this study.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure - hypercarbic/hypoxemic, appeared to be
[**2-21**] CHF by evidence of volume overload on CXR, also contributed
by his OSA and pulmonary HTN. Was initially treated with nebs
and steroids, but with little improvement. He was intubated
