Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 y/o M with a history of obesity, HTN, NIDDM,
Hypercholesterolemia, DVT s/p IVC filter placement and PE on
coumadin, who presents with worsening SOB over the past 3 weeks.
He was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] on [**12-25**] for SOB, and per
patient, diagnosed with "bronchitis." He was given Advair, which
did not relieve his symptoms. Since then he has become gradually
more short of breath, especially with exertion, such that he has
to rest after walking only a few feet. At rest, he denies SOB.
He sleeps on 2 pillows at baseline but notes that he is now
completely unable to lie flat. He also notes a dry cough that
developed a few days ago and a sensation that there is
"something" in his chest that he just can't cough up. He denies
fevers, chest pain, left arm or jaw pain, sweating, leg pain or
swelling, and weight gain. (Baseline weight is 338lbs, was
335lbs at PCP's office today). He also denies recent travel,
sick contacts, smoking, and h/o asthma. He notes that this
dyspnea is somewhat similar but less severe than when he had a
PE in [**2117**]; at that time he was completely unable to walk. He
re-presented to PCP's office today and was found to be
tachypneic w/ RR28, O2Sat 945, HR 108, BP 130/100. Of note, he
decreased his coumadin dose last week as his INR was 3.7 on
[**1-9**].

In the ED, vitals were T 97.6, P 106-120, BP 122-134/70-93, RR
25-30, O2Sat 98%RA. He was given levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 and
nebs x1. He had a CXR and chest CT to rule out PE, but was
unable to complete the scan because he could not lie flat. Due
to concern for PE, he was bolused with heparin and then started
on heparin gtt.

On exam, he again denies CP and notes that dyspnea is improved
with rest, nebs, and supplemental 02.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Dyspnea - Differential diagnosis included PNA, PE, MI and CHF
(likely systolic), with highest suspicion for volume overload in
setting of CHF given exam, history, imaging, and elevated BNP.
He does have a significant DVT/PE history, but because he has an
IVC filter and INR was supra-therapeutic when his symptoms
began, suspicion for PE was low. Admission Chest CT showed
bilateral effusions and bilateral LL opacities, which may
represent infection, edema, or atelectasis. He was unable to
complete the IV contrast portion of the CT scan and thus PE
could not fully be ruled out. He was started on heparin drip and
kept on this overnight until INR >2.0. Once INR became
therapeutic, heparin gtt was d/c'd and patient was transitioned
to home coumadin dose PO. Admission labs showed elevated CKMB
and mildly elevated troponin. He was given NTG, morphine,
metoprolol x1, though suspicion for ACS was low. He was
maintained on ASA 325mg, simvastatin 20mg, and home [**Last Name (un) **]. Cardiac
enzymes were cycled and trended down. EKG was not consistent
with acute MI. Given than he had been afebrile and with minimal
cough, he did not receive antibiotics. Urine legionella Ag was
negative. Attempted to obtain sputum cultures but patient could
not generate sputum to send. The patient was given lasix 20mg IV
x2 and met goal UOP of 1-2L negative, with improvement in
symptomatic dyspnea and oxygen requirement. Patient was also
given albuterol and ipratropium nebs prn. Echo was ordered but
not completed before discharge to floor.  On floor cont'd
diuresis with goal of [**11-20**].5 L/day.  TTE showed global
dysfunction, dilated CM.  Cardiology following t/o
hospitalization. W/u for global CM performed with no
idenitifiable cause obtained.  Underwent cardiac cath which
showed minimal disease.  Cont'd on [**Last Name (un) **], held CCB, startedon
coreg, lasix and aldactone and cont'd on as outpt.  Will
follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] within the week for CM.

.
#.NIDDM: Home hypoglycemic agents were held and patient was
maintained on ISS.  Restarted on home meds on d/c.
.

#.Gout: Asymptomatic. Allopurinol continued.
.
# PE PPx: On coumadin on admission.  INR subtherapeutic on

coumadin afterwards bridging with heparin gtt until therapuetic
INR acheieved.
