History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 year old black male who was admitted on
[**2191-3-28**] for replacement of non-functioning penile implant. The
patient underwent uncomplicated penile implant removal and
replacement with urology on [**3-27**]. On the evening of [**3-27**], he
developed severe chest burning and discomfort. He reported that
his chest was "on fire", and has never had such severe symptoms
before. He denied SOB or nausea with this pain.  His pain never
truly went away. He was given aspirin and cardiac enzymes were
negative at the time. EKG was reportedly "normal", however, upon
re-evaluation there were noted to be ST elevations  inferiorly.
Cardiology was consulted. An EKG the next morning showed
continued elevation inferiorly with positive enzymes.

He underwent immediate cardiac cath which showed 3VD with 70%
mid LAD, 90% D2, 80% OM, 70% r-PDA, and 90% RCA lesion. No
interventions were performed. No Plavix was given. A Heparin
infusion without bolus was started and the patient was
transferred to the CCU. On arrival to CCU, Integrillin was
started. He initially required a nitro infusion, which was
discontinued with him remaining chest pain free.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2192-3-28**]):
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
triple vessel disease. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had mild
proximal
disease then a 70% tubular lesion at the take off of the 2nd
diagnol and
a 90% tubular lesion at the take off and involving the D3.  THe
LAD
gives rigorous to the distal RCA via its septal branches. The
Lcx had
diffuse moderate serial lesions proximally.  There was an
atretic AV
groove LCx. The OM is a large bifurcating with long smooth 80%
mid-distal(starts proximal to the upper pole and goes all the
way down
to the mid and lower pole.  The RCA had a very long diseased
segment
involving the whole mid vessel (vertical segment) with serial
lesions
tapering to 90% in 3 spots.  THe lumen of the rest of the
segment is 60%
diseased.  THe r-PDA had a 70% mid lesion.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed systemic normotension
with
elevated left sided filling pressures and an LVEDP of 20mm HG.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.
TEE [**2192-3-29**]:Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferior wall dyskinesis, akinesis of the
mid to distal inferior wall and apex, akinesis of the distal
septum, and hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferoseptal wall,
basal to mid inferolateral wall, mid anteroseptal wall, and
distal anterior wall. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal, with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a small pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of
the results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient is on
an epinephrine infusion. Left ventricular function appears
improved (LVEF 35-40%). The inferior wall which was previously
akinetic is now hypokinetic. Right ventricular function is
slightly improved. Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. The aorta
is intact post-decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
