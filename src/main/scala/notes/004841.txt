Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Multiple bronchoscopies
Embolization of the right bronchial artery by interventional
radiology
prolonged MICU stay
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
42 year old female with a history of chronic alcohol abuse,
Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, GI bleed from gastric/duodenal ulcers,
and a RUL cavitation felt to be secondary to post-obstructive
[**Hospital 16486**] transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU on
[**2133-9-28**] for hemoptysis. She initially presented to the [**Hospital1 1474**]
ED with a chief complaint of "coughing up blood" from 5:00 am
the morning of [**2133-9-27**]. She reported shortness of breath, sore
throat, dizziness and sinus congestion.  VS were: T 100.3 P: 128
BP: 112/83 O2 sat: 100%. Her hematocrit in the ED was 31.0. An
NG lavage was negative and rectal exam was guaiac negative. She
then began to "vomit" bright red blood and was intubated for
airway protection. Bright red blood was noted in the ETT tube
which persisted despite repeated suctioning. She was then
transported to the OR for urgent bronchoscopy which was not
completed. She was transfused 1 unit PRBC and 2 units FFP. Her
pressures dropped as low as the 80's and she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] MICU for futher care.

[**9-30**] RUQ US: Fatty infiltration of the liver. Cannot exclude
more advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis and/or fibrosis.
Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. Ascites.
Splenomegaly.
.
[**10-14**] swallow study: no aspiration
.
[**10-26**] CXR: Stable radiographic appearance of right cavitary
lesion. No superimposed focal consolidation or edema-like
process noted. Interval placement of PICC line with no
pneumothorax
.
[**2133-11-3**] CXR: Again seen is a 2.5 mm cavitary lesion in the right
upper lobe. There is a small left-sided pleural effusion. There
is left lower lobe atelectasis. Multiple left sided healing rib
fractures are again seen.

.
repeat RUQ US: with no ductal dilitation, CBD on 3mm
.
[**10-16**] chest CT: 1. Cavitary lesion at the right upper lung with
soft tissue density seen within it. While this may represent a
mycetoma within an old benign cavity, a cancerous lesion cannot
be excluded and correlation with direct tissue sampling is
recommended. No additional cavities seen.
2. Diffuse hazy opacities throughout the lungs may represent
infection or hemorrhage.
3. Splenic infarct. Recommend echo to assess for cardiac origin
of emboli
.
[**10-29**] CT chest: stable RUL cavity although appears to be
extending toward chest wall; + inflammation surrounding cavity.
Resolution of some of the haziness in the lung parenchyma
(especially the LUL), mild pulmonary edema.
.
[**10-17**] CT abdomen: 1. Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion,
mild-to-moderate ascites, and moderate mesenteric fluid. All of
these areas of fluid are of intermediate density, of 24
Hounsfield units, which can be consistent with an exudative
process, such as chylous effusion of infected fluid.
2. Coarse appearance of liver consistent with cirrhosis.
3. Chronic splenic infarct.
.
TTE: no vegetations
.
LENI ([**2133-11-10**]): No evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. RUL cavitary lesion: The patient was transferred to the MICU
with bright red blood per the ET tube, and underwent
bronchoscopy and embolization of the right bronchial artery.
She ruled out for TB, and underwent several bronchoscopys which
did not uncover the cause of her lesion.  One sputum grew
Aspergillus sp. not fumigatus, and one grew Aspergillus
fumigatus. CT scan performed to characterize lesion, and the
etiology and appropriate management was widely debated by the
pulmonary, thoracic surgery and infectious disease services.
The scan had evidence of disseminated/semi-invasive disease of
the lungs that would require systemic antifungals.  She began
empiric treatment with Ambisome for likely aspergillus
infection, which she did not tolerate secondary to acute renal
failure.  At this point, the option of surgical removal came up
again, however, the patient was considered high operative risk
with as high as a 25% chance of perioperative mortality from the
procedure.  Moreover, there remained a concern about invasive
disease, which could not be completely resected.  The other
option was Voriconazole, which was not ideal given her
underlying liver cirrhosis.  Hepatology was consulted regarding
the risk of fulminant liver failure on voriconazole, which was
deemed to be around 13%. The decision was made to treat the
patient with voriconazole with close monitoring of her liver
function, in an effort to contain the infection, such that it
could be removed at a later date.  The patient began
voriconazole therapy with close monitoring which she tolerated
well.  She was discharged on voriconazole, and will have a
repeat CT scan performed within a week of discharge to evaluate
the extent of her disease after several weeks of systemic
therapy.  She was hesistant to undergo surgery at the time of
discharge, given the potential recovery time. She will follow up
with Infectious Disease and Thoracic Surgery as an outpatient.
Further treatment decisions will be made after her repeat CT
scan.
.
2. Hepatitis/Pancreatitis: During her ICU stay, the patient
developed transaminitis and elevated total bilirubin to a max of
10, most likely secondary to alcoholic hepatitis.  She also
developed diffuse abdominal pain and was found to have
pancreatitis. MRCP was negative for stone/ductal dilation.  Her
lab abnormalities corrected without intervention.  She was
started on Ursodiol for cholestasis.
.
3. Pleural effusion: She was found to have a left pleural
effusion. She underwent thoracentesis in which 1.2 liters of
bloody fluid was removed. All cultures were negative.  Etiology
unclear, although likely related to her fungal infection.
.
4. Acute renal failure: developed se
