Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
48 y/o Cantonese speaking F with a history of a rt groin
synovial sarcoma s/p extensive resection in [**2160**] presenting with
shortness-of-breath, cough and right shoulder pain that started
2 weeks ago. She was in her usual state of health until 2 weeks
ago when she developed a persistent cough that continued to
progress with subjective low grade fevers and chills at home.
She presented to a physician when her cough continued to persist
for more than 1 week and she was started a azithromycin
approximately 2 days ago. For the past two days she has had
increasing difficulty with breathing, particularly when she
attempts to lie flat. This morning, she suddenly felt worse with
increased work of breathing and presented to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED inital vitals were T 100.5, HR 100, BP 108/71, RR 20
and 100% on RA. Labs were notable for WBC of 10.6 w/ 0% bands,
h/h 9.3/28.3, AST/ALT 67*/100*, alkphos 275* T.bili, 4.4* Lipase
of 93 and lactate of 1.1. CXR showed white out of the RLL (ddx
collapse, post obstruction pneumonia vs diaphragmatic collapse)
w/ a superimposed right pleural effusion/pleural thickening.
Additional findings included a mass in the left mid lung zone
and probable lymphadenopathy in a paratracheal distribution all
argued in favor of a metastatic process. CT torso demonstrated
large low density metastases in the chest on the right w/ a 13cm
x 11cm mass collapsing the right lower lobe and compressing the
right atrium, shifting the mediastinum to the left. A smaller
mass was seen on the left. Findings consistent w/ hepatic and
groin mets were also seen.

On arrival to the ICU, VS were T 97.8 HR 90 BP 153/90 RR 20
satting 100% on 15L NRB.

CXR [**2164-1-4**]:
There is opacification of the lower right lung zone, with a
lucent crescent just superior to the opacified portion. Pleural
effusion tracks
behind the aerated upper lobe. There is soft tissue thickening
along the
right main bronchus. An opacity projects over the left mid lung
zone. The
mediastinal structures are roughly midline, without apparent
volume loss.
There is no left pleural effusion. Indentations upon the right
lateral aspect of the trachea are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lung zone white out, which might be the result of
airway
obstruction with post-obstructive pneumonia, collapse (though
lack of volume loss argues against this), or paralysis of the
right hemidiaphragm. There is a superimposed right pleural
effusion/pleural thickening. Additional findings of a mass in
the left mid lung zone and probable lymphadenopathy in a
paratracheal distribution all argue in favor of a metastatic
process. CT is recommended for further evaluation.
2. The lucent crescent seen adjacent to the lower portion of the
aerated left lung is felt unlikely to be free air, though this
can be better evaluated with CT.

CT Chest/Abdomen [**2164-1-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary masses concerning for metastasis, large on the
right measuring up to 13cm with significant mass effect causing
leftward cardiac and mediastinal shift.
2. Hypodensity within segment III of the liver, new from prior
and concerning for focal fatty infiltration versus metastasis.
MRI may be performed to further assess.
3. New poorly defined hypodensities in the kidneys, concerning
for metastasis vs. infection.
4. Large anterior abdominal wall hernia containing small bowel
and colon,
uncomplicated.
5. Post surgical changes in the right groin, without definite
evidence of
local recurrence.


Brief Hospital Course:
48F s/p synovial sarcoma resection, now presenting w/
respiratory distress and radiographic evidence of new right lung
mass and liver mass and who passed away from hypoxemia from the
lung mass.

# Respiratory distress/lung metastasis: Patient presented with
worsening dyspnea and cough, and was found on CXR and CT scan to
have large occlusive mass on the right side, most likely
metastatic disease from prior known sarcoma. Thoracic surgery,
IP, radiation-oncology and hematology-oncology all consulted and
presented various treatment options, with surgery as the most
likely definitive care. Extensive goals of care discussions were
had involving ICU team, palliative care, social work, and
chaplain.  Her sister was designated as HCP.  Discussion with
patient and her sister yielded wish to be [**Name (NI) 3225**] without further
pursue of treatment for metastatic cancer. Morphine drip and
ativan prn were started to alleviate respiratory distress. The
patient passed away on [**2164-1-8**] from hypoxemia from the
underlying lung mass. Family at bedside.

# Hypothyroid: Patient s/p RAI for Grave's.  Levothyroxine
discontinued once patient [**Date Range 3225**].

Medications on Admission:
Levothyroxine 50mcg daily
azithromycin day 3
