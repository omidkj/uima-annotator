INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
Patient's last name spelt as Brrry in the prebypass study .
Changed for Post
Bypass study
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Normal LV wall thickness. Normal regional LV
systolic function.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal
aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:

1. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
2. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
3. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass
1. The patient is being AV paced.
2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.
3. Mild Mitral regurgitation persists.
4. Aorta intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 3646**] is a same day admit for CABG. Pt had cardiac
catheterization [**10-6**] and was then referred for CABG. Pt seen
and evaluated at that time. now readmitted for CABG on [**10-12**],
please see operating room report for full details. In summary pt
had CABGx4 with LIMA-LAD,SVG-Diag,SVG-OM, SVG-PDA, her bypass
time was 86 minutes with crossclamp time of 77 min. Tolerated
operation well, transferred to CT ICU on Neo and Propofol in
Sinus rhythm with mean arterial pressure 102.
Pt did well in immediate post-op period, and was sucessfully
extubated the day of surgery. His pulmonary status remained
tenuous and he remained in the ICU for pulmonary toilet and
monitoring for several days. On POD3 the patients chest tubes
and temporary pacing wires were removed. The patient was noted
to have some confusion most pronounced at night, all narcotics
and benzo's were discontinued. By POD6 the confusion had
resolved and he was transferred to the floors for continued
post-op care and cardiac rehabilitation. Over the next several
days the patients activity level was advanced and on POD 9 the
patient was transferred to reabilitation at [**Hospital3 27503**]-[**Location (un) **]
