Port CXR [**11-16**] - The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Lung
volumes are slightly low. There is no focal consolidation,
pleural effusion, or
pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascularity is normal

Port CXR [**11-17**] - Lungs clear. Heart size normal. No pleural
abnormality. There may be some subglottic edema, but this area
is not well evaluated by this examination.

CXR [**11-18**] - The heart size is normal. Mediastinal position,
contour and width are unremarkable. The lung volumes are low
with minimal opacity seen in the left lower lobe that might be
consistent with small area of atelectasis. The lungs are
otherwise clear with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 20y/o F with a PMH of asthma and vocal cord dysfunction
admitted with stridor and concern for airway compromise
.
1) Stridor - Resolved within a few hours of admission to the
MICU after receiving racemic epinephrine, standing nebs,
solumderol, and terbutaline.  No further stridor during hospital
course.
.
2) Respiratory distress - Likely [**3-20**] asthma exacerbation. The
patient was continued on standing and prn nebs, steroids, and
placed on heliox, which was weaned off within 12 hour of arrival
to the MICU. She was noted to have paraosymal episodes of
coughing that would subsequently worsen her wheezing and
shortness of breath and was placed on tessalon perrls and
guaifenesin with codeine. She was transferred out to the medical
floor on hospital day 2. Upon arrival to the medical floor, she
triggered for tachypnea and sinus tachycardia in the 130-140s
during an episode of coughing and shortness of breath. Nebs were
changed to levalbuterol. The patient slowly began to have
clinical improvement with po steroids, nebs, and her home
regimen of inhalers but would continue to have worsening chest
tightness and coughing with exertion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the pt's
[**Last Name (STitle) 19039**], was consulted who also recommended increasing her
advair from 250/50 to 500/50 dosing, increasing prednisone to 1
mg/kg dosing (90 mg daily), and starting a 7 day course of
azithromycin for anti-inflammatory effect. Upon discharge, she
was sating in the upper 90s on room air and ambulating shorter
distances without significant distress. Prednisone was decreased
to 60 mg daily and the pt was instructed to avoid prolonged
exertion for 1 week and to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the following
week in regards to a steroid taper and outpatient follow-up.
.
3) Depression - Continued lamictal.
