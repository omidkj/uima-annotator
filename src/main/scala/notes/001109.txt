Chief Complaint:
chest pressure and shortness of breath with mild exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-8-14**] - Coronary bypass grafting x4: Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the second
diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single graft
from the aorta to the third diagonal coronary artery; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from the aorta to the first obtuse
marginal coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
This 74 year old man has a history of hyperlipidemia, prior
tobacco abuse, mild COPD and prostate cancer, s/p radiation. He
reports that several months ago he began to notice mid sternal
chest pressure and shortness of breath with mild exertion, ie.
Walking up a slight incline. Because of these symptoms, his
primary MD referred him for a stress echo which revealed new
akinesis of the lower anterior septum and apex.

The patient also reports a history of intermittent GI bleeding,
particularly noticed in the past when he was constipated. He
recently underwent a colonoscopy on [**2120-7-16**]. This revealed mild
radiation proctitis and diverticulosis. GI recommended
proceeding
with cardiac catheterization. On [**2120-7-18**] the patient was
evaluated
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology who prescribed him Aspirin, Plavix
and Diovan/HCT. About one week following his colonoscopy, the
patient reported a moderate amount of BRBPR. A repeat Hematocrit

was found stable and he has not had any further evidence of
bleeding.

With regard to symptoms, the patient reports that over the past
three to four weeks he has been feeling better with no
significant symptoms, although he has remained quite sedentary.

Physical Exam:
blood pressure was 139/60. Veins are flat. Venous pressure
approximately 5 cm of water. He has upper and lower dentures.
Tongue was papillated. Carotids show normal upstroke. There is
no cervical adenopathy. Chest is clear. Heart sounds are

liver or spleen. Extremities show full pulses. There are no
peripheral skin lesions.


Pertinent Results:
[**2120-8-14**] ECHO
PRE CPB No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST CPB Normal biventricular systolic function. Thoracic aorta
appears intact. Mild mitral regurgitation remains. No other
changes from pre-bypass findings.

[**2120-8-14**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**8-5**], there has been placement
of
an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 7 cm above the
carina. Right Swan-Ganz catheter extends to the outer edge of
the mediastinal aspect of the right pulmonary artery.
Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach. Left chest tube is in
place and there is no pneumothorax. Substantial atelectatic
changes are seen at the left base.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2120-8-14**] for elective surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was  taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see operative
note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologicall intact and was extubated. Beta blockade,
aspirin and a statin were resumed. He was then transferred to
the [**Doctor Last Name 6552**] down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He has progressed well from a PT standpoint, has
remained hemodynamically stable, and is ready for discharge to
home.
