Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/Fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 44058**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic
    aortic valve bioprosthesis reference number [**Serial Number 10859**],
    serial number [**Serial Number 86046**].
2. Full left-sided Maze procedure with a combination of the
    AtriCure bipolar Synergy system and a CryoCath with
    resection of left atrial appendage.
3. Pericardial resection.


History of Present Illness:
84 year old female with history of mitral regurgitation and a
chronic pericardial effusion who was admitted for shortness of
breath this past [**Month (only) 359**]. She was diuresed with improvement in
her symptoms. Her pericardial effusion was again noted however
the decision was made not to drain it as the effusion was stable
without evidence of tamponade. Her last echocardiogram showed
severe mitral regurgitation with mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgition. As well she suffers from paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. Given her espisode of heart failure and her severe
mitral regurgitation, she has been referred for surgical
management.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears to
be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Tricuspid regurgitation is [**12-27**] +. There is a moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on [**2143-12-13**] at 1500 hours.

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine
and epinephrine. LVEF= 40%. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the
mitral position. It appears well seated and the leaflets move
well. The tricuspid regurgitation is mild. Aorta is intact post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
