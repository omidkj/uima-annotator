Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid Bronchoscopy
Upper Endoscopy
Endoscopic ultrasound


History of Present Illness:
53 y/o M s/p self-inflicted gunshot injury to face in [**2187**] with
resulting tracheostomy, who presented to [**Hospital6 14576**]
in [**Location (un) 8973**] [**6-6**] c/o increased secretions from tracheostomy.
They were yellowish, and this had been going on x 3 weeks. He
reportedly didn't feel his breathing was worse than usual. He
denied fevers or chills. He had been seen in the ED one day
prior to this with the same complaint and was sent home with
Levaquin. He continued to require more frequent suctioning and
so returned to the OSH ED the next day. He also was having
coffee-grounds aspirate from G tube, and BRBPR. At that time, he
was afebrile, bp 140/80, RR 20, and O2 sat 95% on 40% trach
mask. He was felt to have bronchospasm, and begun on frequent
nebulizers, steroid taper, and IV levofloxacin. GI felt that his
GI bleeding was [**3-4**] gastritis and hemorrhoids.  On HD1 at the
OSH, he was noted to be in resp distress and tube feeds were
suctioned from his lungs. His ABG was 7.22/78/64 and he was
transferred to the ICU. He was tachypneic in the 30s and c/o
respiratory fatigue so was placed on the vent in the early
morning [**6-7**]. In the ICU, his uncuffed trach was changed to a
cuffed trach with a fair amount of difficulty. He was placed on
PCV due to high peak pressures. He was emergently bronchoscoped
which revealed severe hemorrhagic bronchitis but was difficult
because the bronchoscope that was used was unable to suction. He
was changed to Zosyn upon arrival in the ICU, and was also
placed on flagyl when he developed a distended abdomen with a
lot of gas on the RUQ (CDiff pending). He also was begun on
vancomycin when staph grew from his sputum. He had a neck CT
done to evaluate the degree of his tracheal stenosis, which was
severe. At this point he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of his tracheal stenosis, for IP procedure. In the
MICU patient initially put on ventilator and was switched to
trach mask the following day.

Pertinent reports:
[**2195-7-6**] Radiology CTA ABD PELVIS
IMPRESSION:
1) No new pseudoaneurysms identified.
2) No significant change in soft tissue mass surrounding the
hepatic artery branches, though the proper hepatic artery is now
somewhat attenuated when compared with the prior study, though
still patent.
3) Slightly decreased size of retrogastric soft tissue density.

[**2195-7-3**] Cardiology STRESS INTERPRETATION: 53 year old male with
IDDM and vascular aneurysms presents to the laboratory for
evaluation of coronary artery disease. The patient received
0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over three minutes. No anginal
symptoms were reported by the patient. The dipyridamole was
reversed with 125 mg of amiophylline IV. No significant ST
segment changes during the procedure. Rhythm was sinus with rare
APBs.
Hemodynamic response was appropriate. IMPRESSION: No ischemic
ECG changes or anginal symptoms. Nuclear report sent separately.


[**2195-7-3**] Radiology PERSANTINE MIBI
IMPRESSION: 1.Normal myocardial perfusion study. 2. Normal left
ventricular
size and function.

[**2195-7-2**] Cardiology ECG Sinus rhythm Poor R wave progression -
is nonspecific and may be within normal limits but clinical
correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2195-6-24**], no
significant change

[**2195-7-2**] Cardiology ECHO Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. A small, mobile echodensity (about 5 mm) is attached
to a catheter seen in the right atrium (probable thrombus). No
atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with  maneuvers. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are  normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good  leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are  seen on the aortic
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.  No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. No mitral
regurgitation is  seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Impression:  1. No cardiac source for systemic embolization
seen.  2. A small, mobile echodensity is seen on the tip of a
catheter in the right atrium. This likely represents a small
catheter-associated thrombus.

[**2195-7-2**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  IMPRESSION:
1) Right subclavian central venous catheter is seen with the tip
extending into the right IJ, beyond the image margin. The
results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name
