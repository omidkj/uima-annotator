Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p 8 coils in gastroduodenal artery perfomrmed by
Interventional Radiology
s/p failed EGD attempts x 2 due to esophageal diverticulum


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 85 y/o M w/recent MICU admission for GI bleed, discharged
[**5-8**] to rehab, who was admitted to ICU on [**5-9**] from rehab with
BRBPR.
During his prior hospitalization , he was admitted to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**4-27**] with weakness, and a Hct of 21. Patient underwent
an EGD x 2, which both times revealed a large duodenal ulcer
with overlying clot. Interventional was unable to be completed
due to techinical difficulties. Patient subsequently failed to
respond to transfusion appropriately without a significant drop
in his Hct. He required a total of 12U PRBCs and 4U FFP. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2152-5-2**] for further management and
question of surgical intervention. Before transfer, his course
at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure
requiring intubation (felt to be due to volume overload from the
transfusions vs aspiration pna), and hypotension requiring
pressors (which occurred after receiving propofol for sedation).

*
Upon arrival here on [**5-2**], he was extubated and weaned off
pressors. He required no further PRBC transfusions as his Hct
remained stable. GI service evaluated the patient and felt that
there was no diagnostic or interventional need for antoher
endoscopy. He was treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and
flagyl for sepsis (presumed source aspiration pna). He was
transferred to the floor on [**5-5**]. On the floor, he had an
attempted thoracentesis as he had a pleural effusion seen on
both CXR and chest CT, but they were unable to get any fluid. He
remained hypoxic, requiring 2L O2 to saturate 95% and
desaturated quickly with any movement. He was discharged to
rehab on [**5-8**] with instructions to complete a 14-day course of
levo and flagyl.
*
Patient at rehab on [**5-9**], developed bright red blood in his bowel
movements and was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]. No records from the [**Hospital1 1501**] are
available. In the ED, he was initially hypotensive to 108/53 but
otherwise hemodynamically stable. Patient proceeded to have
BRBPR, and his initial Hct was 23 [**5-9**] (was 28 [**5-8**] prior to d/c).
The ED resident and attending were unable to place an NGT. He
was transfused 2U PRBCs, given 1L NS, protonix 40 IV, and was
transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, GI evaluated him and performed EGD on [**5-10**]. They
were able to advance the scope pass the upper esophageal
sphincter but there after it entered a broad cavity without
exit, presumably a Zenker's diverticulum with large opening. It
was presumed to be Zenker's diverticulum in the
crico-pharyngeus, preventing passage of the scope into the
esophagus. Other techniques to document bleeding site and
intervene, such as angiography were considered and patient
underwent one on [**5-10**]. There was no evidence of active bleeding
seen on initial angiogram. With the prior known location of
duodenal ulcer, it was decided to proceed with gastroduodenal
artery embolization. Patient had a 8 coil embolization of the
gastroduodenal artery. On this subsequent arteriogram, a small
branch arising from the proximal gastroduodenal artery was still
perfused. Patient's Hct subsequently was stable. His last
transfussion was on [**5-10**] (for a total of 2+2 units over
[**Date range (1) 8305**]). Patient was transfered to regular floor for further
care.
.
Patient is alert and oriented to place. He denies any
fevers/chills, no lightheadedness, no abdominal pain, no nausea,
or vomiting, no chest pain, no shortness of breath, no chest
pain, no dysuria/hematuria, no myalgias/arthralgias.
