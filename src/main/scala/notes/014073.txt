Pertinent Results:
[**2119-2-8**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated a three vessel coronary artery
disease. The LAD and LCx had separate ostia. The LAD had a 95%
hazy ulcerated plaque and an 80% mid vessel stenosis. The LCx
had a 60% mid vessel lesion. The OM1 was a bifurcating vessel:
the upper pole was non-obstrcuted and the lower pole was totally
occluded and filled via collaterals. The RCA was a small caliber
vessel with a 90% bifurcation lesion at the PDA and the PLB. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed a normal left sided filling
pressure with an LVEDP of 8 mm Hg. 3. Left ventriculography
revealed no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 72424**] was calculated to be 70% with a normal
wall motion. LV cavity was small and LV was hyperdynamic.
[**2119-2-10**] Chest/Abd CT: 1. Severe emphysematous changes in the
upper lobes bilaterally with asymmetric apical scarring, left
greater than right, both changing calcification which are
presumably chronic changes. No adenopathy. If there are any
prior older radiographic studies available elsewhere, it would
be helpful to compare these to assure no suspicious interval
change has occurred. Otherwise, PET CT may help confirm no
underlying malignancy. 2. Atherosclerosis and calcified coronary
artery plaque. 3. Truncal cutaneous and subcutaneous
neurofibromas. 4. Mild prostatic enlargement. 5. Two small left
iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] lucencies.
[**2119-2-10**] Head CT: 1. No acute intracranial pathology, including
no sign of intracranial mass or hemorrhage. 2. No intracranial
"stigmata" of neurofibromatosis; scalp subcutaneous nodules
could represent neurofibromas or other associated dermal
lesions, and clinical correlation is recommended.
[**2119-2-13**] Head MRI/MRA: There is a small lacune within the right
side of the pons. There are minimal periventricular white matter
hyper-densities most consistent with minimal chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. There are no enhancing lesions.
And there are no areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility.
There is no midline shift, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. There
is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct. The 3D
time-of-flight MRA is normal with no evidence of aneurysms or
stenoses.
[**2119-2-15**] Echo: Pre Bypass: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild basilar inferior
hypokinesis. The overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal ([**Month/Day/Year 72424**]>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch and borderline complex atheroma (.36-.39 cm) in the
descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis.The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve appears normal with no tricuspid
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve is normal with physiologic
regurgitation. Post Bypass: Preserved biventrciular function.
[**Month/Day/Year 72424**] >55% with no change in wall motion. Aortic contours remain
intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings disucssed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**2119-2-20**] CXR: Comparison with [**2119-2-18**]. The patient is
status post median sternotomy and CABG. There is stable bullous
change within the lung apices, as well as small bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left. No pneumothorax is
seen in the background of bullous disease. There is no new
consolidation or pulmonary edema, or cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from OSH and
underwent cardiac cath on [**2-8**]. Cath revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease and he was referred for surgical
intervention. Prior to surgery he required extensive work-up
which included multiple radiologic studies and consultations.
Medicine and cardiology services managed patient during his
work-up prior to surgery. On [**2-15**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 5. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. On
post-op day one he was started on diuretics and beta blockers.
He was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day
two he was transferred to the telemetry floor. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. On post-op
day two he had an episode of atrial fibrillation which was
treated with Amiodarone and beta blockers. He started PO
Amiodarone and beta blockade was advanced. Physical therapy
followed patient during entire post-op course for strength and
mobility. He remained in SR for >48 hours prior to discharge and
on post-op day six he was discharged home with VNA services and
the appropriate follow-up appointments.
