History of Present Illness:
85 yr old female patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8579**] with hx of CAD, CABG
[**2131**] and stenting in [**2162**] as well as left leg angioplasty [**2158**],
s/p right leg stents [**2-28**], also has a left common femoral
aneurysm (still present after thrombin injection), on coumadin
for PAF, who presents for elective cardiac catheterization
tomorrow. Patient has experienced recent increased exertional
angina. Symptoms occur often at nighttime, where she has noticed
that she develops chest discomfort when she moves pillows around
on her bed. She notes relief of the pain with one nitroglycerin

defect.. EF is noted to be 41%. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8579**] has requested
Mucomyst administration prior and after cath.

Imaging:
.
[**11-30**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
a 50% lesion in the LMCA.  The LAD was totally occluded and
filled via
vein graft. The Lcx had a mid 50-60% discrete lesion. The RCA
had a mid
60-70% discrete instent restenosis.
2.  Graft angiography demonstrated a svg to the mid LAD witha
70%
proximal lesion, instent restenosis with evidence of thrombus.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with a pcwp of 25mmHG and RVEDP of 20mm Hg.  Moderate
pulmonary hypertension was present with a PAP of 63mm Hg.
Cardiac
output was normal at 4L/min.  There was severe systolic
hypertension at
163mmHg while on a nitroglycerine drip.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease of the native arteries.
Left
main disease, and instent restenosis of SVG-LAD graft.
2.  Severe systolic hypertension with evidence of diastolic
dysfunction.
3.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**11-30**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to inferior
posterior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
[**12-1**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the inferior
vena cava
catheter has been removed. The remaining monitoring and support
devices are
in unchanged position. Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis, the
presence of a
small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Unchanged
borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of
overt pulmonary edema.
.
[**12-15**] CXR: As compared to the previous examination, there is no
relevant
change. Moderate cardiomegaly without signs of overt pulmonary
edema.
Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pleural effusions.
No focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

[**12-19**]: UE venous US:
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus seen adherent to the PICC
line within the left basilic vein extending into the left
subclavian vein.

[**12-24**] Renal US:
1. No renal abscess or son[**Name (NI) 493**] signs of pyelonephritis.
Please note that
a normal ultrasound does not exclude the diagnosis of
pyelonephritis.
2. Benign simple-appearing right renal cyst.
3. Bilateral renal calcifications likely representing vascular
calcifications
and tiny crystals with no evidence of obstructing stones or
hydronephrosis.
