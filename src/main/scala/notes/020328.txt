of 96% on room air.  The patient was started on intravenous
nitroglycerin, BiPAP, and given Lasix and aspirin.  Her

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs were
temperature of 97, heart rate 115, blood pressure 110/70,
respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room
air.  General appearance was pleasant.  HEENT revealed 5-cm
of jugular venous distention.  Right pupil was reactive.
Left pupil was opaque.  Oropharynx were clear with moist
mucous membranes.  Lungs had rales one-third of the way up

had trace edema.  Neurologically, alert and oriented times
two (thought it was [**Month (only) 205**]).

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram with normal sinus
rhythm at 123, poor R wave progression, slight ST depressions
in I, aVL, and V6 with slight ST elevations in V1 to V3, a
Q wave in lead III.

Chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema (signs of congestive heart
failure).

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Arterial blood gas on 100%
nonrebreather of 7.41/33/80/22.  Lactate 5.5.  Creatine
kinase #1 was 120, troponin 6.3.  Creatine kinase #2 was 381,
MB 41, index 11, troponin greater than 50.  Creatine kinase
#3 was 63, MB 30, index 8, troponin greater than 50.
Creatine kinase #4 was 262, MB 15, index 6, troponin 42.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is an 86-year-old female with
a past medical history only significant for diabetes mellitus
and hypertension who presents with shortness of breath.  Her
examination and chest x-ray were consistent with congestive
heart failure.  The patient also had lactic acidosis which
may have been secondary to decreased perfusion and low
cardiac output.  The patient's cardiac enzymes ruled her in
for a myocardial infarction.

The patient was started on a heparin drip.  Both captopril
and Lopressor were started and titrated up.  Aspirin was
continued.  An echocardiogram was obtained and revealed an
ejection fraction of 15% to 20% with severely depressed left
ventricular systolic function and severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with 3+ mitral regurgitation and 3+
tricuspid regurgitation.  It was decided the patient would
only be treated medically for her acute coronary syndrome.
In addition, Lipitor was started.

On [**2173-8-3**] (on hospital day five) the patient was
deemed medically stable for discharge to home.  Physical
Therapy consultation recommended discharge home with home
physical therapy.  The patient was to follow up with primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3510**], in one week and he will
