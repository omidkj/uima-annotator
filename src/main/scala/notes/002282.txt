HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old man
with past medical history of Child's class C cirrhosis
secondary to alcohol hepatitis C, currently on the transplant
list, history of multiple upper gastrointestinal bleeds
secondary to varices status post recent Medical Intensive
Care Unit admission with bright red blood per rectum in
[**12/2166**] who presents with increasing confusion, fatigue,
nausea, and lower extremity swelling times three to four
days.

Per his sister, he has been increasingly confused at home,
walking into the wrong rooms, forgetting to take meds,
including insulin and Lactulose, urinating on the floor
inappropriately.  He has had nausea and decreased appetite
and p.o. intake for several weeks more so in the past few
days.  Overall he has noted a big decrease in his energy
level, having suffered fatigue after one flight of stairs.
This has been exacerbated by insomnia.  He was recently
started on Trazodone with no relief of his insomnia.  His
lower extremity edema has been worse, as well.

Recent colonoscopy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] on [**2167-1-27**] noted marked
tortuosity of hepatic flexure resulting in interruption of
exam.  Also noted were non-bleeding grade 1 hemorrhoids and
colonic varices of hepatic flexure, not actively bleeding.

Patient denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth, emesis,
diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, bright red
blood per rectum.  No dysuria, frequency, cough, sputum, sore
throat.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA, X-RAYS, OTHER STUDIES:  White
blood cell count on admission showed WBC 4.8, hematocrit
37.8, MCV 100, platelets 88.  Coagulation profile showed a PT
of 19.3, PTT 47.8, INR 2.5 up from 2.3 on [**2167-2-4**] notably
also up from 1.9 on [**2167-1-21**].  Serum chemistry showed a

Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process.
Ultrasound of the abdomen showed no demonstrable remarkable
ascites, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
patent.

Serial blood cultures and urine cultures at the time of this
dictation failed to show any significant bacterial growth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cirrhosis with end-stage liver disease:  Patient is on
the transplant list.  Although he has been slowly declining,
he has had an acute decompensation in the last three to four
days to one week prior to this admission.  This was
concerning for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, other
infection, bleeding, [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease, and/or blockage
of TIPS.

He was followed with serial hematocrits throughout bleeding;
all stools were guaiac.  There was no evidence of bleeding
during this admission.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound was
performed due to assess patency of the TIPS and to assess for
ascites.  Ultrasound demonstrated patency of the TIPS and no
ascites.  We followed his renal function closely out of
concern for hepatorenal syndrome.  During admission
creatinine appeared to increase slowly each day.  Blood and
urine cultures were sent to rule out systemic infection.
Serial cultures failed to reveal any source of infection.
Initially he had no antibiotic coverage.

However, during hospital course on [**2167-2-12**] he developed a
new onset of cough with clinically significant areas of
rhonchi and crackles on his lung exam concerning for
pneumonia.  As such, he began a seven- to 10-day course of
Levaquin at that time.

Lactulose was continued for encephalopathy.  Dose was
increased from 30 to 45 ml q.i.d. titrated to four to five
bowel movements per day.  Even so, the patient remained
encephalopathic with moderate asterixis on exam.  Diuretics
were initially continued at his outpatient dose as we felt he
was intravascularly dry with total volume overloaded.  This
was likely from loss of albumin as an intravascular oncotic
force.  After development of a respiratory infection
concerning for pneumonia, diuretics were held out of concern
that increased secretions and ........... losses will lead
the patient to dehydration in the setting of diuretics use,
as well.

Nadolol was continued as prophylaxis against variceal
bleeding.  Coagulation performed.  Albumin and bilirubin were
followed as markers of liver function were calculated the
patient's meld score.

2.  Questionable pneumonia versus bilateral effusions:  On
admission there was some concern for a possible pneumonia.
Chest x-ray was evaluated which demonstrated no acute
cardiopulmonary disease.  As such, the patient was not
initially covered on antibiotics.  However, during this
hospital course his lung exam deteriorated and he began to
have
