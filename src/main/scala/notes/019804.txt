Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] trauma service on [**2148-9-12**] for
orthopedic ORIF of the right pelvic fracture on [**2148-9-13**].
Intraoperatively, when patient's fracture when exposed, it was
found to involve the superior gluteal artery which was entrapped
in
the fracture plane. Upon attempting to reduce the fracture
plane, the gluteal artery started bleeding profusely. The
bleeding from the lacerated gluteal artery proceeded
significantly. Attempts at tamponade were unsuccessful given
that the proximal aspect of the gluteal artery had retracted
into the pelvis. At this point, the procedure was aborted. A
spanning plate was placed, securing only partial fixation and
reduction of the posterior column in order to maintain the joint
reduced. The posterior wall segment was just held position
transiently with three 2.5-mm screws. Additional screws that had
been placed for reduction and use of the far half clamps were
left in position and will need removal. The wound was packed and
closed transiently with a whipstitch, and the patient was taken
to angiography in order to manage the profuse bleeding.
Approximately 10 units of blood (EBL 3500 cc) were used during
the case.  Following emergent transfer to interventional
radiology, pt underwent successful embolization of the right
superior and inferior gluteal arteries via ten 3 mm x 3 cm and
two 2 mm x 2 cm coils and remained hemodynamically stable
thereafter.  Pt was transferred to the T/SICU, still intubated
and sedated with propafol, for further management.  He was
started on cefazolin for osteomyelitis prophylaxis, hydralazine
and metoprolol for BP control, famotidine for GI prophylaxis,
sliding scale insulin, and morphine/hydromorphone for pain
control.

Pt remained stable, intubated, and in c-collar (awaiting c-spine
imaging from [**Hospital3 **]) in the T/SICU; electrolytes were
monitored and repleted as needed as pt continued maintenance IV
fluids.

Pt returned to the OR on [**2148-9-16**], still intubated and sedated,
for orthopedic irrigation & debridement of his open hip wound
and to finish the open reduction internal fixation of acetabular
fracture.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was
returned to the T/SICU w/o incident or complication.  Cefazolin
was discontinued.  Sedation was withdrawn on [**2148-9-17**] in an
attempt to wean from ventilator; pt was successfully extubated
on [**2148-9-18**]; mental status remained depressed, preventing C-spine
clearance.  Pt's home psychiatric medications were reintroduced,
and he began to become more responsive, affording transfer to
the floor by [**2148-9-19**].  -Bronch samples from the OR grew
PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA sensitive to CIPROFLOXACIN, and given CXR
evidence of pneumonia, cipro was started on [**2148-9-19**].  Utilizing
imaging studies from [**Hospital3 **] and pt's improved
alertness, pt was clinically cleared of C-spine injury (with
collar removed) on [**2148-9-20**] with an interpreter present.  F/u CXR
on [**2148-9-23**] showed resolution of PNA.  Daily wo
