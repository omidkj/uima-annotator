Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13541**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Gastroesophagoduodenoscopy

History of Present Illness:
86 F with HTN, CHF, [**Hospital 79982**] transfer from OSH with duodenal bleed
for push enteroscopy.  She was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2138-10-4**] with dyspnea.  She reports about 1-2 weeks of dyspnea on
exertion (after walking to BR, for example).  Recently ([**9-21**])
also admitted to OSH pneumonia.  Presented to OSH and found to
have hct 29.  Initially also treated with antibiotics
(ceftriaxone and azith) and diuresis. Then developed melanotic
stools, and BRBPR while hospitalized.  She required 11 units
PRBCs over the last four days.  Has also gotten platelets and
FFP.  EGD on [**2138-10-7**] showed antral ulcers and unremarkable first
part of duodenum.  Tagged RBC scan was positive for distal
duodenal/proximal jejunal bleed.  Capsule endoscopy showed
bleeding in the duodenum.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further workup.  She reportedly had no hypotension or
hemodynamic instability at OSH.

At [**Hospital1 18**], she remained hemodynamically stable.  She had an EGD
which showed ulcers in the distal bulb and second part of the
duodenum.  The duodenal ulcers were cauterized.  She had H.
pylori serum antibody and serum gastrin levels sent which are
still pending at the time of discharge.  She was hypertensive at
the hospital, and was restarted on Amlodipine 5mg [**Hospital1 **] and
metoprolol tartate 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  She was switched from atenolol to
metoprolol because of her elevated creatinine.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension, currently on amlodipine and metoprolol
2. Hypothyroidism, on levothyroxine
3. Anxiety - takes diazepam prn
4. CHF.  Per OSH cardiology consult, CHF R<L, hyperdynamic LV,
mod-severe TR, mod PA HTN
5. H/O PNA one month ago
6. CKD, baseline creatinine unknown
7. PUD, now s/p duodenal ulcer cauterization
8. Osteoporosis

Social History:
Lives at home with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] son lives next door.  Able
to perform ADLs with some difficulty.  Former smoker quit 20
years ago, 50 pack years.  EtOH of [**1-6**] drinks per day.  Denies
past history of withdrawal, has gone ??????2-3 days?????? without a drink.

CT ABD/PELVIS [**10-11**]:
1. Evidence of severe portal hypertension, with widely
recanalized umbilical
vein, ascites and splenomegaly, likely related to chronic liver
disease.
2. Anasarca. Small bilateral pleural effusions, with related
bibasilar
atelectasis.
3. Mild thickening and stranding surrounding second and third
portions of
duodenum.
4. If there is concern for pancreatic mass, as can be seen in
Zollinger-
[**Doctor Last Name 9480**] syndrome, dedicated CTA pancreas would be required. No
suggestion of pancreatic mass seen on the current study which
was not designed to evaluate the pancreas.
5. Status post hysterectomy.

CXR [**10-9**]:
AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
Heart is mildly enlarged. There may be extremely heavy mitral
annulus calcification. Left pleural effusion is small. A
probable small hiatus
hernia obscures some of the left lung base. Lungs are otherwise
clear aside from mild vascular congestion. No pneumothorax.

EGD [**10-10**]:
Erosion in the pre-pyloric region
Ulcers in the distal bulb and second part of the duodenum
(thermal therapy)
Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 86 year old female with PMH significant for
peptic ulcer disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, CHF who was
trasnferred from OSH for management of GI bleed.

#GI Bleed: At OSH, the patient had melena and BRBPR and required
multiple transfusions. She has evidence of a lower duodenal
bleed by trbc scan, capsule endoscopy and EGD. At [**Hospital1 18**], an EGD
showed lower duodenal ulcers which were then cauterized. H.
pylori serology was negative. She remained hemodynamically
stable and did not have further episodes of bleeding, and she
was discharged with pantoprazole and sucralfate. Please note
that strong consideration should be given to obtaining a serum
gastrin level to rule out Zollinger [**Doctor Last Name 9480**] syndrome given her
multiple duodenal ulcers.

# Acute blood loss anemia: She was transferred a total of 12
units of PRBCs at the OSH, along with FFP and platelets. Her
hematocrit remained stable at [**Hospital1 18**], without need for additional
platelet transfusions. B12 and folate levels were within normal
limits.

# Thrombocytopenia: The patient had an initial platelet count of
144 at OSH, which then dropped to 55. She received FFP and
platelets at OSH. Her thrombocytopenia was likely due to an
active bleed and platelet consumption. Her platelet count
improved during her hospital stay and was 113 at discharge.

# CHF: Per OSH, the patient has hyperdynamic LV function,
moderate TR and PA hypertension. The etiology of her CHF is
unclear, though OSH reports suggest primary pulmonary pathology,
and diastolic dysfunction.

# HTN: The patient's blood pressures were elevated and she was
restarted slowly on her antihypertensives. Her atenolol was
switched to Metoprolol due to chronic kidney disease, as
atenolol is renally cleared. Recommend maintaining the patient
on Amlodipine and Metoprolol XL 50 mg qd.

# CKD: Baseline Cr unknown; 1.7-1.9 at OSH, around 1.5 at [**Hospital1 18**].
If another antihypertensive is added to her regimen, consider
ace-inhibitor given renal function.

# Hypothyroidism: TSH elevated, free T4 wnl. Levothyroxine was
continued.

# Severe portal HTN: CT scan showed signs of severe portal
hypertension, ascites and splenomegaly. No transaminitis.
Further work-up was not pursued, but should be
considered in the out-patient setting, including referral to the
[**Hospital1 18**] Liver Center if judged appropriate.

# EtOH: The patient admits to drinking [**1-5**] drinks daily, but
says she can stop when she wants. She says she began drinking
more when her husband left his job. She has not exhibited any
signs of withdrawal. Her EtOH use is particularly concerning
given her use of diazapam for anxiety. She is at risk for
thiamine defiency and was repleted.  She s
