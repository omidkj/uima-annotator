Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3913**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective admission for chemotherapy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 60-year-old female with PMHX significant for AML M6,
erythroleukemia, diagnosed in [**2101-11-24**] who is currently
admitted for re-induction chemotherapy.  Pt underwent initial 7
+ 3 therapy with cytarabine and idarubicin on [**11-28**]. Her hospital
course was complicated by ARDS with MICU intubation believed to
be secondary to an allergy to merepenum.  During that
hospitalization she also developed an interstitial pneumonitis
and coagulase negative bacteremia.  The patient did not undergo
consolidation or bone marrow biopsy secondary to her complicated
ICU course and her counts have been
closely monitored since her discharge. [**12-7**] the patient was
found to have a recurrence of her leukemia.  Since that time,
she has been maintained on periodic blood products and [**11-26**]
platelet transfusions/week.  She denies any
fever/chills/N/V/CP/SOB/diarrhea/dysuria.

Past Medical History:
1. Acute myelogenous leukemia, status post chemotherapy with
Idarubicin and Cytarabine.
2. Adult respiratory distress syndrome secondary to an
allergic reaction to Meropenem.
3. Neutropenic fever.
4.H/o adrenal insufficiency during MICU stay
5. Enterobacter cloacae pneumonia.
6. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus intravenous
catheter-related bacteremia.
7. Hypoxic respiratory failure.
8. Simple cyst of the right kidney
9. H/o R knee injury

Social History:
She lives in [**Location 1468**]. She has never been married. She has
brothers in [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 10478**], and a cousin in [**Name (NI) 1110**],
with whom she is close. She works as a bank teller. She quit
tobacco 15 years ago after a history of [**11-26**] pack per day x 10
years. She has rare alcohol use, and denies any history of IV
drug use.

Family History:
Mother died from a CVA, and her brother had
a heart attack at about 60 years of age. Her father passed
away from lung cancer.

[**12-26**] TTE:

1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).

normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5.The mitral valve
leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo female w/ PMHx significant for AML s/p induction x1
complicated by MICU course now relapsed, admitted for
re-induction.

AML - Pt had a TTE on admission that showed and EF of 75%.  [**12-26**]
the patient was started on a five day course of chemotherapy:
mitoxantrone 15 mg IV & etoposide 145 mg IV.  The patient
tolerated her chemotherapy well without major complications.
She did occasionally require supplemental oxygen for an oxygen
saturation in the low 90's in the first three days.  [**1-2**], the
patient complained that the stiches on her chest from the
central line were itchy and painful.  At this point she was
neutropenic with an ANC of 420.  She was evaluated by radiology
and a decision was made to replace her line to a catheter that
could be more conveniently sutured to her neck.  On [**1-2**] the
patient was also transferred to 11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] since she was deemed
stable and there was a need for beds on the BMT unit.
.
[**1-3**] the patient spiked a fever to 101.0 and was given a dose of
vancomycin and gentamicin.  CXR showed no pneumonia.  She was
maintained on vancomycin and aztreonam.  [**1-4**] the patient spiked
a fever to 103.4 and complained of a sore throat and cough.  She
was tachycardic to the 120's.  [**1-5**] the patient had a temp of
103.3 and complained of chills, sore throat, and diarrhea.
Caspofungin and gentamicin were added at this time.  Stool
studies were sent for C. diff and found to be (+).  The patient
was then started on flagyl.  [**1-6**] the patient was still febrile
to 101.  An ID consult was called.  Pt had a history of
questionable antibiotic allergies that were not totally
confirmed.  Per ID recs aztreonam was discontinued for possible
penicillin allergy.  Flagyl was also stopped to minimize drug
interactions and the patient was started on oral vancomycin for
C. difficile treatment.  CXR showed new lateral LLL opacity,
infiltrate vs. volume loss.  [**1-7**] the patient continued to spike
fevers as high as 103.  Levofloxacin was added at this time.
[**1-8**] the patient spiked a fever to 105.0 with chills and
diarrhea. A CT scan of the chest was obtained that showed
scarring from prior ARDS but no new pulmonary pathology.   She
was also found to have low K+, low Mg, and low platelets.  She
was given repletion and + 2 liter fluid balance for the day.
[**1-8**] evening the patient became acutely SOB with an O2 sat of ~
50%.  Her lungs had diffuse crackles and she was bringing up
pink frothy sputum.  She was given lasix and benadryl with
modest relief.  Her O2 sats remained persistently low and code
blue was called for respiratory arrest.  Patient was intubated
and transferred to the MICU.  CXR at the time showed pulmonary
edema c/w CHF.  Patient was diuresed with 80 mg IV lasix for -
1.8 liters.  Pt enzymes showed CK 66 > 71 > 46 w/ troponin .05 >
.22.  [**1-10**] the patient was extubated without difficulty but
continued to have fevers/rigors with an associated drop in O2
saturation.  It was thought that the patient could not tolerate
the tachycardia associated with her fevers which sent her into
CHF.  As a result the patient was placed on IV solumedrol for
fever suppression.  [**1-9**] pt had a TTE that showed EF 45% w/
distal wall hypokinesis new from admission.  Cardiology consult
called to see patient in MICU.  Per cardiology, decreased EF and
elevated troponin possibly related to cardiotoxicity of
mitoxantrone.  MI in LAD distribution also considered a
possibility.  Pt was started on low dose ACE inhibitor and
recommended for stress once clinically stable.  Repeat TTE on
[**1-12**] showed no improvement from [**1-9**] TTE.  [**1-14**] pt transferred
out of MICU to floor.  [**1-14**] & [**1-15**] pt found to have elevated
transaminases thought to be [**12-27**] to voriconazole.  Voriconazole
d/c'd and caspofungin started with resolution of LFT
abnormalities.  [**1-15**] pt was found to be hyperkalemic to 5.6, as
a result, captopril was stopped.  Solumedrol taper was also
intiated as the patient continued to be afebrile.  [**1-18**]
gentamicin d/c'd and levofloxacin started.  [**1-20**] steroids
tapered to off and patient remained afebrile. All antibiotics
were tapered once she reamined afebrile with temp<100.6 without
