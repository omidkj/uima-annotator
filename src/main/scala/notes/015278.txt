Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Intubation

History of Present Illness:
82 year old with h/o of DMII, HTN, Asthma, OSA, dCHF, peripheral
neuropathy who is admitted for AMS and hypercapnea.
.
Patient was recently admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] [**2122-12-29**], at the time she
had presented with AMS, was found to be hypercarbic and
requiring intubation, she was noted to have fluid overload and
was diuresed with lasix, she did not have evidence of pneumonia,
LENIs were negative, and echocardiogram showed a preserved
biventricular systolic function without pulmonary hypertension.
Therefore, it was felt that her hypercarbia was due to not
wearing night time BIPAP for successive days leading to slow
increase in her PCO2 +/- central apnea. She did well after
extubation and was discharged to rehab with nighttime BiPAP and
oral lasix.
.
Per her daughter at baseline prior to previous hospitalization
was wheelchair bound most of the day but could make a few
independent steps to the bathroom. Needed help in ADL. Demented
with occasional visual + auditory halucination.  At rehad
continued to complain of weakness but did PT, walk around some
with a walker. Per daughter patient was using BiPAP [**Hospital **] rehab but
continued to have issues with ill fitting mask.  Per rehab
patient was fine last night, on check this AM around 10:15
patient was found to be lethargic. No recent fevers or illness
recorded. In the ED patient was conversant and reported wearing
her BIPAP yesterday evening. Denied HA, blurry vision, CP, SOB,
abdominal pain, dysuria, or increased LE edema. Pt stated she's
been compliant with meds at rehab. She stated she feel fine
except for "tiredness". States she did not sleep well last
night, cannot say why.


Past Medical History:
-type 2 diabetes mellitus
-hypertension
-atypical peripheral neuropathy with cutaneous sensations ("dust

on her skin", seen by [**Hospital 878**], on gabapentin + olanzapine)  -
tactile hallucinosis per PCP
[**Name Initial (NameIs) 15372**]: appears to be adult onset asthma. [**2106**] spirometry is
restrictive physiology with bronchodilator response.
-macular edema s/p surgery
-neovascular glaucoma secondary to her proliferative diabetic
retinopathy  - blind left eye > right eye
-OSA (prescribed BiPAP, not currently using)
-osteoarthritis
-dementia
.


Social History:
Patient is wheelchair bound due to old osteoarthritis and vision

loss. In setting of a few recent falls in her apartment, her
daughter stays with her at her apartment. Born and grew up in
the Carribean. Worked in a chocolate factory in [**Location (un) **] in the
[**2059**]. Arrived in the US in [**2070**]. Denies tobacco, EtOH, IVDA.
Lived with her daughter [**Name (NI) **] in [**Name (NI) 669**] for the past 2 years.
Needs help in ADL. In rehab since previous discharge [**2121-1-2**].

Family History:
Father with diabetes mellitus, died at age 69.  Mother with

mellitus and polymyositis. Youngest daughter with anoxic brain
injury [**1-22**] trauma, in rehab.

Imaging:
[**1-8**] CT head w/o con: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial
pathology.
[**1-8**] CXRay: IMPRESSION: Right perihilar and left infrahilar
opacities, worrisome for aspiration in the setting of suspected
seizure, although not entirely specific.
[**1-9**] EEG: Prelim: No signs of seizure
[**1-10**] CXRay: Cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal. The
lung fields are clear. The costophrenic angles are sharp. Mild
pulmonary plethora may be present.
[**1-12**] Echo: Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal
regional and low normal global systolic function. Increased
PCWP. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified.
[**1-12**] MRI: 1. Unchanged prominent perivascular space versus
lacunar infarct on the left basal ganglia.

2. Minimal asymmetry of the temporal ventricular horns, this
finding is
nonspecific and no frank evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis
is identified.

3. There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement or diffusion
abnormalities.

4. Polypoid formation noted on the left maxillary sinus, likely
consistent
with a mucus-retention cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old male w/ DM, no known sz d/o, p/w seizures in the
context of non ketotic hyperosmolar state, intubated for airway
protection, loaded with Dilantin, stabilized, extubated, and
without recurrence on floor.
.
# Seizures: Pt presented with 3-4 complex partial seizures on
day of admission.  [**Month/Year (2) 878**] was consulted.  The seizures were
thought to be secondary to CNS effects of non ketotic
hypersomolar state (glucose on admission 690) in the setting of
medication non-compliance. The pt was treated with insulin and
fluids and loaded with dilantin for the seizures. No acute
process on CT head or MRI. Tox screen was negative and pt denied
heavy drinking or substance abuse. Prelim EEG read did not show
any active seizure activity.  The patient was discharged on
dilantin with [**Month/Year (2) **] follow-up.
