Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain/Shortness of Breath
CHF,demand ischemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 85 year old man recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**2137-1-20**] for bilateral lower lobe pneumonia complicated by a
NSTEMI. Patient has reported history of untreated multiple MIs
in the [**2111**] and has diagnoses of HTN, CKD, CHF, DVT,and bipolar
disorder. On last admission, the patient had an echocardiogram
that revealed an EF 40-50% with global LV hypokinesis. The
cardiology service was consulted at this time with
recommendation that the patient was likely a poor cath candidate
given his multiple comorbidities and CKD with creatinine of 2.5
The patient was discharged back to his home at Heathwood NH with
decision to manage patient's cardiac disease medically. Per
notes from E.D. the patient is reported to have experienced
chest pain and dyspnea early this a.m. that was relieved at that
time with SL-NTG x1. The patient's symptoms recurred and was
treated again with nitropaste as well as lasix 120mg PO, without
resolution of symptoms this time. Given his symptoms, the
patient was trasnferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was found to be
tachypnic and dyspneic on arrival. In the ED, the patient was
treated with ASA 325mg, 80mg IV lasix, O2, NTG gtt and was
started on non-invasive ventilation, with reported resolution of
pain. The patient was treated with an additional 160mg IV lasix
without good initial response. Upon transfer to the CCU, the
patient had produced only 300cc urine.

[**Last Name (STitle) 1266**] has been very involved with this patient regarding
code status and goals of care. Currently, the patient is full
code as was established on last admission and confirmed this
admission. Given patient's overall prognosis and expectation
that the patient will require more and more frequent
hospitalization, conversation is ongoing with regards to overall

Imaging:
[**2137-3-3**]: Portable Chest - There is stable cardiomegaly.  The
left
costophrenic angle is excluded from the radiograph.  There is
slight
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature centrally but no overt
edema.  Again identified is bibasilar opacification persisting
at the lung bases slightly increased in the left lower lobe
compared to the prior study which could be residual edema or
atelectasis.  The possibility of mild volume overload or
developing infection cannot be excluded.  No pneumothorax is
identified.  The soft tissue and osseous structures are stable.

IMPRESSION:  Slight increase in opacification at the lung bases
reflecting
bibasilar atelectasis or possible developing infection/mild
volume overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: Patient is an 85 year old male with past CAD hx who
presents with CHF exacerbation and enzyme leak likely secondary
to demand ischemia.
.
Cardiovascular:
CHF:  The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of
decompensated CHF including dyspnea, rales on exam and
peripheral edema. The patient additionally reported chest pain
on admission that was initially responsive to nitrate therapy,
then refractory. In the ED the patient was assessed to be in CHF
and was treated with lasix, 120mg IV in total, nitro gtt, and
additionally given aspirin given chest pain and history of CAD.
The patient was noted on admission to have an supratherapeutic
INR of 5.1 on admission for which additional anticoagulation
with Heparin gtt or Lovenox was held. The patient's ECG on
admission was remarkable for an old LBBB with some non-specific
TWI in I and aVL, poor R wave progression but no significant or
acute ST changes. The patient was admitted to the CCU for
ongoing diuresis with additional monitoring of enzymes for
potential NSTEMI. Of note, in the ED the patient was initially
treated with non-invasive mask ventilation with good effect.
Attempted diuresis prior to admission only yielded an outp
