Date of Birth:   [**2088-9-8**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 37-year-old male
with a history of reportedly positive stress test in [**2124**],
with medically managed CAD, who reports an upper respiratory
tract infection one month prior to admission including fever,
myalgias, and a deep cough productive of yellow sputum.  He
noted all of his symptoms resolved except for his cough, and
within the 2-3 weeks prior to admission, he developed
increased swelling in his right foot, then his left foot, and
then progressing up into his abdomen.  He had also noted
increasing shortness of breath worse with exertion especially
with heavy lifting and stairs.

He reported that this has culminated over the last 2-3 weeks,
worse in the last few days.  He denies any chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.  He also denies
lightheadedness, dizziness, or palpitations.  He does report
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and orthopnea with the use of
two pillows.  He also reports a subjective 20 pound weight
gain.  He reported his weight a month and a half ago was 210
pounds and the day prior to admission it was 228 pounds.

He also reports significant alcohol use history.  Although he
reports, he no longer drinks.  He reports that he used to
drink approximately a pint of liquor per week.

He was transferred to the CCU after having right and left
heart catheterization revealing normal coronaries and
increased right and left sided filling pressures with a
depressed cardiac index.  He was transferred to CCU with a
Swan in place and for hemodynamic monitoring and tailored CHF
therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Positive stress test in [**2124-10-10**] revealing a
partially reversible inferoseptal defect and an ejection
fraction of 45%.
2. Hypertension.
3. Alcohol abuse.
4. Motor vehicle accident at age 18, which resulted in ORIF
of a femur.
5. Gout.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient reports that he lives alone.  He
used to be married, but has gone through divorce.  He runs a
restaurant.  He denies any current alcohol or IV drug use.
He reports that he has smoked approximately 1-2 packs a day
for 15 years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother had diabetes and peripheral
vascular disease.  He reports that his father is well.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Toprol XL 50 mg q.d.
2. Lisinopril 20 mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vitals revealed blood
pressure of 124/76, pulse of 114, respirations of 20, and he
was saturating 97% on room air.  In general, patient was
alert and oriented and in no acute distress.  There was no
obvious respiratory distress.  On HEENT exam, his pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and his extraocular
muscles were intact.  His oropharynx was moist and without
lesions or exudates.  He had flat neck veins while lying
flat.  His lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly and
laterally.  His heart was regular, and he had a normal S1,
S2.  He had a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the
apex.  He had a notable S3.  On examination of his
extremities, he had [**2-12**]+ pitting edema bilaterally to his
knees.  He had a right groin venous sheath with a Swan in
place with the area being clean, dry, and intact and
nontender.  His abdomen was distended, however, nontender.
He had normoactive bowel sounds.  He had 1+ posterior tibial
and dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC revealed a white count of
7.5, hematocrit of 46.6, and platelets of 250.  Chemistries
revealed a sodium of 144, potassium 4.2, chloride 102, bicarb
of 33, BUN of 12, creatinine of 1.0, and glucose of 101.  He
had normal LFTs.  He had a HIV test on admission which was
negative, [**Doctor First Name **] titer which was negative, normal iron studies,
and normal cholesterol panel.

EKG on admission showed sinus tachycardic at a rate of 103,
with normal axis, and normal intervals, he had flattened T
waves throughout and T-wave inversions in V6.

He had a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2126-1-29**] which
revealed an ejection fraction of 15-20%, dilated LA and RA,
dilated left ventricular with severe left ventricular hypo
and akinesis.  He also had evidence of 3+ mitral
regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, and small
pericardial effusion.

He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2126-1-29**] which
revealed normal coronaries in a right dominant system.  He
had elevated right sided pressures with a RA pressure of 20,
RV pressure of 60/24, and a PA pressure of 64/37.  He had a
wedge of 35 and a LV pressure of 114/36.  His cardiac output
and index were 3.6 and 1.6 respectively.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  Patient was admitted in
congestive heart failure with a diagnosis of idiopathic
cardiomyopathy.  He had multiple studies sent all of which
were negative and no final diagnosis was made as to the
etiology of his cardiomyopathy, however, it was felt to be a
combination of alcohol induced with a possible overlying
viral etiology.  Due to his elevated filling pressures and
depressed cardiac output and index in the Catheterization
Laboratory, he is transferred to the CCU with a Swan in place
for hemodynamic monitoring and tailored CHF therapy.  He was
admitted to the CCU on a Natrecor drip, which was continued,
and resulted in significant diuresis of approximately 10-12
liters.

Milrinone was added the day after admission for decreased
afterload and help with cardiac index with a goal pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of less than 20.  As he responded to
these two medications, his milrinone was titrated off as an
ACE inhibitor was started and titrated.  He was continued on
his aldactone and Toprol XL as well as Lasix.

As mentioned above, he had a significant diuresis.  He was
followed by the Heart Failure service and will follow up with
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the Heart Failure Clinic.  Once he has gone
through significant diuresis, Natrecor and milrinone were
weaned off, and he was maintained on CHF regimen including
spironolactone 25 mg q.d., digoxin 125 mcg q.d., lisinopril
40 mg q.d., and Toprol XL 100 mg q.d.

He was also started on Coumadin 5 mg q.h.s. while admitted
due to severe left ventricular hypo and akinesis and possible
concern for thrombus formation with a result in increased
risk of stroke.  He was discharged without a therapeutic INR,
however, will be followed up several days after discharge for
an INR check.

He received heart failure dietary teaching prior to
discharge, however, will also be followed up closely by the
Heart Failure service after discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Idiopathic cardiomyopathy.
3. Hypertension.
4. History of alcohol abuse.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  At the time of discharge, patient was
without complaints.  He denied any shortness of breath and
had much improved peripheral edema.

FOLLOWUP:  As mentioned above, he will have followup with the
Heart Failure service, and has an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the Heart Failure Clinic on [**2-25**] at 9 a.m.
He will also be followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] in the
Department of Electrophysiology three months after discharge.
He will also see his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will
schedule his own appointment 2-3 days after discharge for an
INR check.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Spironolactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Digoxin 125 mcg p.o. q.d.
3. Warfarin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.
