CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior myocardial infarction status post
stent placement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year-old man with a
history of diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease
status post inferior myocardial infarction in [**2159**] and
catheterization in [**2168-5-4**] at outside hospital, which
showed only 50% stenosis in obtuse marginal with an ejection
fraction of 60%.  He started to experience chest discomfort
associated with shortness of breath, confusion and nausea and
vomiting since [**76**]:30 p.m. the night prior to admission.  He
contact[**Name (NI) **] his primary care physician who then referred him to
[**Hospital **] Hospital.  At [**Hospital **] Hospital he was found to have
an inferior myocardial infarction with 2 to [**Street Address(2) 2051**]
elevations in 2, 3, AVF and ST depressions in V1 through V3.
He had a pacer wire placed for high grade AV block.  He was
also started on Dopamine for hypertension.  He had several
episodes of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular
fibrillation, which required a total of 8 shocks.  He was
intubated and given magnesium, heparin drip, Reapra,
Dopamine, Lidocaine and Amiodarone.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  In the
catheterization laboratory here he required two more shocks
for recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia and
ventricular fibrillation while on Lidocaine and Amiodarone
drip.  The culprit lesion in the right coronary artery was
successfully stented with good reflow.  He was admitted to
Coronary Care Unit for further monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes type 2, chronic renal
insufficiency with a creatinine at baseline of 1.7, coronary
artery disease status post remote inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2159**], catheterization in [**2168-5-4**] with 50%
stenosis in obtuse marginal only, ejection fraction 60%,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, benign prostatic
hypertrophy, depression, status post herniorrhaphy, status
post cataract surgery, status post cholecystectomy two weeks
ago.

ALLERGIES:  Atenolol.

MEDICATIONS:  Glucophage 1 gram b.i.d., Accupril 40 mg po
q.d., Isordil 20 mg t.i.d., Lipitor 5 mg q.d., Amoxicillin
500 mg t.i.d. for two weeks for sinusitis.  Zantac 150 b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Half pack per day for forty five years,
lives alone in [**Location (un) 4047**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  No early coronary artery disease.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Good exercise tolerance, able to walk two
to three miles two times a week prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO CORONARY CARE UNIT:
Weight 244 pounds.  Height 6'2".  Blood pressure 100/56.
Pulse 72.  Respirations 14.  94% on room air.  In general,
elderly gentleman in no acute distress.  Head and neck
examination unable to assess JVD.  Chest clear to
auscultation bilaterally anteriorly.  Cardiovascular
examination regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Adomen soft.  Extremities presence of left femoral
bruit.  No right femoral bruit.  Neurological examination
awake, alert and oriented.  Nonfocal examination.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 11.8, hematocrit 39.6,
platelet 158, PTT 60, INR 1.4, potassium 4.2, chloride 111,
bicarb 19, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1, glucose 224.  Repeated
potassium of 4.3.  Catheterization single vessel coronary
artery disease, acute inferior myocardial infarction, primary
with revascularization of the right coronary artery with good
results.  Coronary angiograph of the right dominant
circulation revealed single vessel coronary artery disease.
The left main coronary artery disease, left anterior
descending coronary artery and left circumflex had mild
intraluminal irregularities without flow limiting narrowing.
The right coronary artery had a high anterior take off with
tortuosity and it was totally occluded in the distal segment
just before the take off of the posterior descending coronary
artery.  There were no collaterals.  Resting hemodynamics
revealed moderately elevated right and left heart filling
pressures with a preserved cardiac index.  Successful
revascularization of the right coronary artery was 3.0 times
13% per stent with good results.  Previous echocardiogram on
[**2168-10-17**], the left atrium is normal in size.  Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities including inferior lateral
and distal inferior akinesis, basal to mid inferior
dyskinesias.  The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
relatively preserved systolic function.  The aortic root is
mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild 1+ mitral
regurgitation is seen.  There is no pericardial effusion.
Ejection fraction 35%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was soon weaned off pressors and
lidocaine and Amiodarone in the Coronary Care Unit.  He
remained asymptomatic post catheterization and had no
significant events on telemetry.  His initial ejection less
then 20% by catheterization most likely due to stent
myocardium secondary to multiple shocks.  His repeated
echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 35%.  His
cardiac enzymes trended downward in the hospital with peak CK
of 2995 and CKMB of 256.  Since he developed quite a large
area of ecchymosis at the left groin site with a bruit on
examination, A femoral ultrasound was obtained, which showed
no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.  Given his risk
of developing cardiac arrhythmia in the presence of poor
cardiac function with an ejection fraction 20 to 35% a
signal average electrocardiogram was obtained for risk
stratification prior to his discharge.  The patient will be
followed up by his own cardiologist as an outpatient and will
discuss with his own cardiologist regarding cardiac rehab and
further risk stratification for arrhythmia.  In the hospital
he was also treated with a five day course of Cipro for
asymptomatic urinary tract infection given the positive
urinalysis on admission.
