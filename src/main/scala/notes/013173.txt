Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Chronic Pancreatitis
Pancreatic Head Mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Pylorus preserving Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy.
2. Open liver wedge biopsy.

History of Present Illness:
This 43-year-old woman is well-known to me as I first took care
of her close to a year ago for pancreatitis of unknown etiology.
She had previously had
a cholecystectomy in the past through an open approach. She had
a very severe episode of pancreatitis at that time, was
transferred to my care and she recovered quite well. However, in
the recovery period imaging found her to have a mass in the head
of the pancreas. This has been followed for close to
a year now and has resolved a little bit in size but still
remains troublesome in its characteristics. Alternatively it
looked solid and cystic. Multiple biopsies have taken place
through endoscopic ultrasound guidance and these have all been
nondiagnostic to date. Most recently she returned to the
hospital with a severe attack of abdominal pain and evidence of
pancreatitis once again.

This patient is a very anxious lady and is extremely concerned
as to why she may or may not have a pancreatic pathology. She is
troubled by the fact that she has had recurrent episodes of pain
and problems and she is very
uncomfortable with the process of observing this lesion which
continues to persist. Furthermore, she has had persistent
diarrhea which has all started in the last year. This was
refractory to major doses of pancreatic enzymes.

1.  Nodule of healing pancreatitis with organizing fat necrosis
and hemorrhage, and fibrosis.
2.  Single focus of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia,
low-grade (PanIN-I).
3.  No exocrine carcinoma or endocrine tumor identified.
4.  Duodenum and bile duct, within normal limits.
5.  Regional lymph nodes; no tumor.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-4-17**] 7:47 AM
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2134-4-17**] at 08:00 hours
and is compared with the prior morning's radiograph. No
significant adverse interval change has occurred. There is low
lung volumes bilaterally. Increased retrocardiac density on the
left side is stable and likely represents subsegmental
atelectasis. No large pleural effusions seen. Right-sided IJ
line and nasogastric tube unchanged in position.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2134-4-18**] 7:40 AM
A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2134-4-18**] at 0745 hours
and compared with the prior morning's radiograph. No significant
adverse interval change. Lung volumes remain low with elevation
of the right hemidiaphragm. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is
present. Right-sided IJ line is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 43 year old female with chronic pancreatitis and a
pancreatic head mass who went to the OR on [**2134-4-14**] for:
Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure).
She did well post-operatively, only having ppost-op hypoxia
related to her Asthma  and followed the "Whipple" pathway.

Pain: She had a PCA for pain control and was followed by APS.
She was transitioned to oral pain medications once tolerating a
diet.

GI/ABD: She was NPO, with a NGT and IVF. The NGT, per the
pathway, was removed on POD 3. Her diet was slowly advanced as
she had return of bowel function. She was tolerating clears
liquids by POD 5. On POD 6, a JP Amylase was measured and was
... The drain was subsequently removed the next day.
Her abdomen was soft, nondistended and the incision with staples
was C/D/I. The staples were removed prior to discharge and steri
strips placed.
/She was tolerating regular food and reported +flatus and +BM
prior to discharge.

Post-op Hyperglycemia: She is a diabetic and takes Lantus and
Metformin at home. She continued to have elevated blood sugars
and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to help manage her blood sugars.

Post-op Hypoxemia: She has severe Asthma and Bronchitis. On POD
1, she was tachycardic and hypoxic with O2 sats in the 60's when
transferring from the chair to the bed. A Chest CT was negative
for a PE. On POD 2, she was transferred to ICU following acute
desat to 60's; on 15L BIPAP and satting only 88-90. She received
nebs and her O2 sats improved. She returned to the floor the
next day and continued with her home inhalers and nebs and had
no further desaturation of O2.

She was on all of her home meds and stable and discharged home
on POD... in good condition.
