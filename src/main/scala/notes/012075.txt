Chief Complaint:
worsening SOB, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with history of PE ([**2-28**], on lovenox),
recurrent PNA, and COPD requring home O2 with a chief complaint
of worsening shortness of breath with acute respiratory distress
at 5am. Due to pt's recurrent PNA he had been treated with
suppressive bactrim therapy until 10 days ago when his
pulmonologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] tried a trial off Bactrim. Then, 5 days
prior to admission he noted increased mucous production, which
was thick and white, not purulent or blood streaked. He had some
worsening cough with eating, but refuses any coughing with
eating at baseline, denies any known aspiration prior to this,
states he had a normal barium swallow in [**Month (only) 359**]. On the morning
of admission he was very dyspneic, and felt similar to previous
times he had PNA. He called an ambulance, and EMS found the pt
tachypneic and diaphoretic with BP 200/p. He was given two SL NG
and 80mg Lasix en route to [**Hospital3 **]. At [**Name (NI) 620**] pt found
to have pneumonia and CHF. Pt has a h/o klebsiella, MRSA, [**Name (NI) **]
and pseudomonas in sputum. Given azith, ceftriax, levo,
solumedrol. Then transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] secondary to no in
patient beds.
.
 He had a PNA vaccine and influenza vaccine this year. He had no
sick contacts. he denies fever, [**Last Name (un) 9507**], HA, myalgia, CP, nausea,
vommiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain. He has a good appetite. At
baseline he can only walk a few steps before becoming SOB. He
uses 3L O2 at home at rest. He requires a wheelchair to get
around.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS: 97.9, 158/69, 97, 99% on Neb. Found to have
a large L infiltrate, gave nebs, lasix, Vanc, and his dose of
lovenox. He continued to be dyspneic and was started on bipap
with much improvement in dyspnea. He was then transfered to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued management of resp distress and PNA.

IMAGING
Port CXR [**12-12**] - Large dense right lower lobe opacity with less
dense surrounding opacity. Given the density of this lesion, the
two most likely considerations are dense pneumonia or an
underlying mass. Both entities could also be a possibility.
Recommend further evaluation with chest CT.

RUE US [**12-13**] - Grayscale, color, and pulsed wave Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed on the right internal jugular,
subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins.  Evaluation
is slightly limited as the patient is not able to lie flat, and
exam was performed with the patient sitting in a chair. The
right arm is diffusely edematous, with 3+ pitting edema on
physical exam.
IMPRESSION:  No DVT in the right upper extremity.

TTE [**12-13**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal for the patient's body size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-3-22**],
the moderate left ventricular hypertrophy and mild estimated
pulmonary arterial hypertension are now better appreciated.

Chest CTA [**12-14**] - 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Consolidation within the posterior right upper lobe, with
debris seen
within the central airways, and right hilar adenopathy.  These
findings are most suspicious for aspiration pneumonia atop
underlying emphysema.
3.  Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.
4.  Dependent atelectasis in both lower lobes, with small
bilateral pleural effusions.  Regions of superimposed infection
cannot be excluded.
5.  No underlying lung mass seen, although portions of the lungs
may be masked by the consolidation and atelectasis.
6.  Coronary artery calcifications.
7.  Enlarged thyroid as previously described


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for RLL PNA and COPD flare.

#) Dyspnea, RLL opacity - On arrival, he was initially on BIPAP
for dyspnea and hypoxia, which was weaned off to oxygen via
nasal cannula on the day of admission. He was given a dose of
solumedrol IV in the emergency room and was started on a slow
prednisone taper as well as standing nebs. The patient was also
started on levofloxacin to cover for CAP with improvement in his
symptoms and O2 requirement. He was also restarted on CPAP at
night for likely OSA. A speech and swallow evaluation was
concerning for aspiration and suggested soft pureed foods only.
A chest CTA was obtained due to the patient's relatively
[**Name2 (NI) 61519**] consolidation seen on admission CXR to rule out an
underlying lung mass showed likely consolidation pneumonia.  He
was discharged to continue a total 14 day course of
levofloxacin, told to take prednisone 40 mg for the next 3 days,
then reduce to Prednisone 30 mg per day until he sees his
pulmonologist.  He was told to restart his Bactrim as suggested
by his primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
