History of Present Illness:
65 year old woman with signficant PMH of atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, lung cancer s/p resection [**2109**], congestive heart
failure, diabetes, cirrhosis, gastritis, and hypertension with
recent admission for hypotension and dehydration at [**Hospital1 2025**] where
blood cx were negative, c.diff x3 negative, and she was found to
have a pansensitive e.coli UTI treated with ceftriaxone. More
recently she had an admission to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2112-6-30**] - [**2112-7-6**]) for
dehydration, C.diff, possible diverticulitis, and sepsis with a
RML PNA. She was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl
and transiently required pressor support. She presents today
with dizziness.

Today at home she c/o "feeling faint" after raising from seated
position. She syncopized with LOC for "a few seconds" and fell
with a resulting left elbow abrasion. She denies headstrike or
other tramua, CP, abdominal pain, dysuria, fever, chills,
sweats, N/V, no associated tonic-clonic activity, incontinence
of bowel or bladder, she did not appear post-ictal. At the time
she was noted to be dry, pale and c/o headache since this AM and
Palpitations and SOB. She has had ~[**4-21**] watery BM the past few
days with 4 this AM. She is A+Ox3. Brought to the ED by EMS.

In ED, initial VS: 98.6, 86, 95/57, 16, 98%. In the ED she
recieved a total of 1000mL. Orthostatics were attempted but she
was unable to stand without tachycardia and hypotension that was
symptomatic. Pressures were in 90s while seated. She was
initially admited to to medicine, however considering she
becomes tachy to 140s-150s with pressures in the 90s systolic
she was admitted instead to the MICU.

On arrival to the MICU, she is AOx3 with PIV placed. She was
bolused with 1L NS due to hypotension and tachycardia.

Studies:

[**2112-7-8**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2112-7-8**] ECHO
IMPRESSION:
1.  Right internal jugular venous access catheter terminates at
the cavoatrial junction, status post partial withdrawal.
2.  Progression of pulmonary edema.  Cannot exclude superimposed

consolidation.  Known right lower lobe spiculated lung lesion
not well
appreciated radiographically.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old woman with signficant PMH of atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, lung cancer s/p resection [**2109**], congestive heart
failure, diabetes, cirrhosis, gastritis, and hypertension with
recent admission for PNA and C.diff presenting with syncope,
found to be hypotensive and tachycardic admitted to the MICU and
volume rescucitated.
.
Acute:
# Hypotension: DDx for this included hypovolemia, septic, and
cardiogenic sources. Given copious amounts of diarrhea and
recent broad coverage with antibiotics, hypovolemia was
considered more probable than sepsis. Cardiogenic was considered
in the setting of mild troponin elevation and palpitations and
SOB on ROS. On arrival to the MICU her Lactate was 2.2. She was
making adequate urine, although her Cr was 1.0 up from 0.6 at
last discharge. Mentating without difficulty. Blood cultures
were sent, her stool was guiac negative, and she remained
afrbrile. She responded well to 5L of NS and her pressures
improved to SBP of 130's the following morning ([**2112-7-8**]) with
resolution of Afib with RVR. Vancomycin and phenylepherine were
briefly utilized but were deemed unessesary given no source of
infection, clinical improvement, and stabilization of VS. She
was restarted on her home metoprolol once vitals stabilized.
This was uptitrated to 37.5 [**Hospital1 **] for better rate control.  Her
other BP medications including torsemide were held.  These were
restarted over the remainder of her hospitalization.  She is
currently hemodynamically stable and without diarrhea on
vancomycin 500mg PO Q6H.
.
# Syncope: Likely related to volume depleted state given
orthostasis. However did complain of palpitations so could
conceivably be due to underlying atrial fibrillation. TTE showed
mild LVH, LA enlargement, and mild valvular disease throughout.
No evidence of diastolic or systolic dysfunction, and mild
pulmonary artery hypertension was
