Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2146-2-12**] Open reduction internal fixation of L femur


History of Present Illness:
(obtained from floor team and ortho notes, as patient is
intubated):  83 y/o F with COPD (2L home O2 by NC), RA (on
chronic prednisone), hypertension, recent T LHA, initially
transferred to medical floor from OSH on [**2-10**] for hip fracture.
She is now s/p [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] of L periprosthetic femur fracture,
transferred post-operatively to MICU for hypotension and
inability to wean ventilator in the PACU. She initially
presented on [**2-10**] after tripping over oxygen tubing in her
kitchen. She called EMS, who brought her to [**Hospital3 19345**] ED. There, she had a negative head CT, and her INR was
> 5. Hip films revealed left hip fracture, and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], repeat head CT was negative for acute abnormalities.
Films of her LLE revealed periprosthetic femoral fracture. She
was seen by ortho, who recommended admission to medicine service
for management of supratherapeutic INR. BP on transfer to the
floor was reportedly 95/58.
.
She was taken to the OR today for [**Hospital1 24785**]. EBL 1000 cc.
Post-operatively, the patient's blood pressure trended down.
Flow sheets indicate BP as low as 85/45. She remained intubated
as she was pulling small tidal volumes in the OR. Her ventilator
settings were changed from CPAP to CMV at 1700, when she
appeared to be using accessory muscles to breathe. She spiked
fevers in the PACU to 101.9. She reportedly had episodes of SVT
that resolved without intervention. Medications given in PACU
included morphine (total 4 mg IV), acetaminophen 650 mg,
enoxaparin 40 mg SC, kefzol 1g IV, and hydrocortisone 100 mg.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient matained her blood pressure
on phenylephrine 4 mcg/kg/min. She later went into a sustained
SVT, with a drop in her blood pressure. The rhythm initially
appeared regular on telemetry, and adenosine 6 mg was given
without effect. 12 lead ECG was obtained, showing rapid afib
with RVR. She was given metoprolol 5 mg and amiodarone 150 mg
push without any appreciable change in her heart rate or rhythm.
She was cardioverted unsuccessfully x3 attempts.  A subclavian
line was placed, and amiodarone gtt was started.

IMAGING:
ECG: Sinus rhythm at 84 bpm. NA/NI. +TWI in V2-V5, +TWF in V1.
Sub-mm ST depressions in V4.
.
[**2-10**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Diffuse T wave changes which are
non-specific. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
[**2-10**] CXR: Limited study as above. There is an eventration of the
right hemidiaphragm of indeterminate acuity. Otherwise, no acute
pulmonary process.
.
[**2-10**] Bilateral hip film: Normal right hip. Question possible
fracture, age indeterminate, of the left parasymphyseal superior
pubic ramus. Apparent left femur fracture due to immobilization
device which limits evaluation of the pelvis as above.
.
[**2-10**] Left femoral film: Mid distal femoral diaphyseal fracture
as detailed above.
.
[**2-12**] LLE fluoro: Thirty five intraoperative spot views. Compared
with the recent study of [**2146-1-31**]. A left hip prosthesis is in
place as before. Oblique fracture of the femoral diaphysis is
redemonstrated. Multiple spot views demonstrate placement of a
slotted plate, multiple screws and cerclage wires. Later images
appear to demonstrate good align
