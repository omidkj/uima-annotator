RUQ US:

FINDINGS: The liver is diffusely echogenic. No focal hepatic
lesions are
identified. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilation. The common duct measures 3 mm. The portal vein is
patent, with forward flow. The gallbladder is nondistended and
normal in appearance. There are no gallstones. There is no
gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The spleen is
normal in size. There is no free fluid in the right upper
quadrant.

IMPRESSION: Normal gallbladder. No biliary ductal dilation.
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other forms
of liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2199-12-24**]

Mr. [**Known lastname **],[**Known firstname **]  was admitted on [**12-24**] with severe intermittent
claudication
with infrarenal aortic and common iliac artery occlusion. He
agreed to have an elective surgery. Pre-operatively, he was
consented. A CXR, EKG, UA, CBC, Electrolytes, T/S - were
obtained,  all other preperations were made.

It was decided that she would undergo a:

PROCEDURES:
1. Aortobifemoral bypass with 12 x 6 aortobifemoral graft.
2. Abdominal pelvic aortogram with iliac artery runoff.
3. Thrombectomy of aortobifemoral graft with [**Doctor Last Name **]
    embolectomy catheters.
4. Bilateral iliac artery angioplasty and stenting with 7
    mm self-expanding stent grafts via bilateral femoral
    cutdown.

He was prepped, and brought down to the operating room for
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well
without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, transferred to the PACU for further
stabilization and monitoring.

He was hypotensive in the PACU with a large volume requirement.
He dropped his hematocrit from 31 to 26. His abdomen became
increasingly tense and he was showing signs of abdominal
compartment syndrome and we decided to re-explore him.

He was taken back to the OR, he then [**Doctor Last Name 1834**] a Exploratory
laparotomy, evacuation of intra - abdominal hematoma and open
packing of the abdomen. He was closely monitored.  Because of
his excessive bleeding a Heme Onc consult was obtained. The
Bleeding was thought to be from DIC.

Heme / Onc reccomendations:

1) pRBC's to keep Hct>30
2) cryoprecipitate to keep fibrinogen >100
3) FFP while actively bleeding to help correct coagulopathy
4) Platelets to keep counts above 50K (while actively bleeding)
5) Check DIC panel and CBC with coags every 3-4 hours.
6) Dose of desmopressin,  for vWF deficiency

The patient did recieve all of the above. His Abdomen was left
open. He was then transferred to the CVICU for further recovery.
While in the CVICU he recieved monitered care.
