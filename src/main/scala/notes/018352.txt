HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80-year-old
white female who was transferred to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 92795**] office for an
episode of chest pain and electrocardiogram changes.

She has a known history of mild aortic stenosis, atrial
fibrillation, diastolic heart failure, hypertension, and
reports progressive chest pain occurring in cold weather, and
on stairs, and with activity.

Two weeks prior to admission, she had pain in her chest which
radiated to her arm.  She is now admitted for cardiac
catheterization.

1.  History of mild aortic stenosis.
2.  History of low back pain.
3.  History of heart failure.
4.  History of atrial fibrillation.
5.  History of hypertension.
6.  History of glaucoma.
7.  History of arthritis.
8.  Status post right total hip replacement.
9.  History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to PENICILLIN and
ERYTHROMYCIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission
included)
 1.  Levoxyl 75 mcg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Flecainide 400 mg by mouth twice per day.
 3.  Timoptic 0.1% one drop both eyes twice per day.
 4.  Xalatan 0.005% one drop both eyes at hour of sleep.

 9.  [**Doctor First Name **] by mouth as needed.
10.  Aspirin 162 mg by mouth once per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient drinks alcohol occasionally.
She does not smoke cigarettes.  She lives with her husband.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was significant for
chest pain and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was an elderly white female
in no apparent distress.  Her vital signs were stable.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
normocephalic and atraumatic.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was benign.  There were no
significant.  There was full range of motion.  No
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotid pulses were 2+ and
equal bilaterally.  There were no bruits.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  There was a
3/6 systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen was obese, soft,
and nontender.  There were positive bowel sounds.  No masses
or hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity examination revealed 1+
pulses bilaterally throughout.  There was 2+ bilateral pedal
edema.  Neurologic examination a nonfocal.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
and underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed the left
ventricle had an ejection fraction of 60%, mild mitral
regurgitation, and anterior apical hypokinesis.  The left
main was heavily calcified with an 80% mid and distal
stenosis and a 70% ostial stenosis.  The left anterior
descending artery had a good target, large first diagonal,
with an 80% origin stenosis.  The left circumflex had a large
ramus with no significant disease.  The right coronary artery
had no significant disease.  She had an intra-aortic balloon
pump placed, and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] was consulted.

The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  On
the following day (on [**11-25**]), the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times two with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and
reversed saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The
cross-clamp time was 26 minutes.  The total bypass time was
60 minutes.

The patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Recovery Unit on Neo-Synephrine and propofol.  She had a low
cardiac output on the night of surgery and required milrinone
and large amounts of fluid.  The patient responded to this.
She also was in atrial fibrillation and was started on an
amiodarone drip.  She remained intubated and was eventually
weaned off her milrinone and was extubated on postoperative
day three.  She was in and out of atrial fibrillation.  She
was followed by Electrophysiology.  She had been on
flecainide prior to admission, but Electrophysiology
preferred to have her on amiodarone.

She remained on the Unit.  She had some hoarseness following
extubation.  She was seen by Ear/Nose/Throat who felt this
was from her prolong intubation.  She also had a swallowing
study which she did well with.

On postoperative day six, the patient underwent a
transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed no clot in her
ventricle.  She then had cardioversion.  Following
cardioversion, she continued to go in and out of atrial
fibrillation.  She had not been receiving her Lopressor due
to a low blood pressure.  Her dose was then decreased.  She
then converted again into a sinus rhythm.  She has been
anticoagulated on heparin and Coumadin.

On postoperative day ten, the patient's heparin was
discontinued as her INR was 2.  She also had an increase in
her creatinine.  Her preoperative creatinine was 1.1 and went
up as high as 1.9.  Her Lasix was decreased.  Her discharge
creatinine was pending.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  She was also slow to ambulate and was
discharged to rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient's condition on discharge
was stable.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON DISCHARGE:  Laboratories on
discharge were pending and will be included in an Addendum.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Percocet one to two tablets by mouth q.4-6h. as needed

 6.  Colace 100 mg by mouth twice per day.
 7.  Miconazole powder three times per day.
 8.  Amiodarone 400 mg by mouth twice per day times one week
and then decrease to 400 mg by mouth once per day times one
week then decrease to 200 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
10.  Coumadin 3 mg by mouth (for a goal INR of 2 to 2.5).
