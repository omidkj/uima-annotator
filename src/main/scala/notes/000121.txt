Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness/lightheaded

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Please see MICU note for full details, briefly 25 yo F w/ Hx of
severe HTN, diagnosed while pregnant (preeclampsia) who
presented on [**11-18**] with chest pain and hypotension. Patient
reports several episodes of N/V/D last weekend but improvement
of symptoms earlier this week. She states medication compliance
as prescribed (900mg labetalol [**Hospital1 **], 90mg nifedipine QD and HCTZ
25mg QD). Prior to presentation she had an episode of SSCP that
radiated down the L arm that was accompanied by dizziness. She
was found to be severely hypotensive and given 6L of NS, 2mg
glucagon X2 for BB overdose, 10mg dexamethasone, 1g calcium
gluconate for CCB overdose, 2g Mg in the ED. EKG--> TWI in III
and aVF (unchanged from prior). A TTE was done while she was
having active CP and this was normal with an EF of 70%. CTA-->
no PE or dissection. Abd U/S--> thickened gall bladder, could be
consistent w/ cardiac or liver disease. She remained
hypotensive, started on peripheral dopamine and admitted to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU, she remained on peripheral dopamine for only a few
hours and has been off pressors for >12hrs with SBP in the
120's. This am she developed acute onset SSCP that was similar
to the episode she had on presentation. She received 3 SLN and
her pain resolved. EKG--> TWI in III, aVF and V1, and TW
flattening in V5-V6 (only new finding). CE's were drawn
initially Trop - <0.01-->0.04-->0.16; CK - 166, 141, 168; MB -
2, 4, 6; likely representing an NSTEMI. Started on heparin gtt,
ASA and statin.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
syncope or presyncope.
