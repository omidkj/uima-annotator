[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 64972**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2183-2-13**] for further
management of her coronary artery disease. She was taken to the
cardiac catheterization lab where a percutaneous attempt was
made to restore flow in her left anterior descending artery
however, the dissection which was present from her outside
catheterization worsened. The cardiac surgical service was
consulted and Mrs. [**Known lastname 64972**] was taken to the operating room where
she underwent single vessel coronary artery bypass grafting on
[**2183-2-14**]. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one,
Mrs. [**Known lastname 64972**] awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Aspirin and beta blockade was started. Her intra-aortic balloon
pump was weaned off and removed without difficulty. On
postoperative day two, she was transferred to the cardiac
surgical step down unit for further recovery. She was gently
diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with her postoperative
strength and mobility. Mrs. [**Known lastname 64972**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day five. She
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist and her
primary care physician as an outpatient.
