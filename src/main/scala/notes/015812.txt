History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20042**] is a 79M with a recent history of pancreatitis
transferred from OSH for management of UGI bleed. Patient
presented to OSH on [**2-8**] from nursing home with melena and Hct of
24. Patient was started on protonix gtt and transfused 3U PRBCs.

Upper endoscopy was attempted at that time, however the patient
did not tolerate the procedure and it was aborted. Repeat
endoscopy showed a large duodenal ulcer with exposed vessel.
Clipping was attempted however unsuccessful and associated with
increased bleeding. IR embolization was attempted at that time
but aborted due to poor access via calcified femoral vessels.
Patient continued to have melenic stool with downtrending Hct
and transfusion requirement. CT was performed and by verbal
reportshowed active bleeding from the GDA, necrosis of the head
of the pancreas, and a previously identified psoas fluid
collection that was decreased in size. Patient underwent
successful IR coiling of the GDA via left axillary access on
[**2120-2-13**]. Since coiling, he has
had persistent melena and required an additional 2U PRBC today.
Since [**2-8**], he has received a total of 8U PRBCs. He has been
hemodynamically stable and not required pressors. Of note,
patient was admitted to OSH in Janurary for pneumonia,
pancreatitis, and possible Cdiff. Stool cultures during this
admission again showed positive Cdiff for which he is receiving
po vanco. Patient currently denies abdominal pain, nausea, and
malaise.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 20042**] is a 79 y/o male who was admitted with upper GI
bleed. He requires multiple transfusions of PRBC. EGD was
performed noting large hiatal hernia,blood in the whole stomach,
3cm Ulcer in the duodenal bulb (endoclip). He was started on a
PPI drip and was take to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who
performed exploratory laparotomy, pyloromyotomy,oversewing
gastric ulcer and ligation of the gastroduodenal
artery.Two JPs were placed. Postop, he was sent to the SICU for
management. He remained there for 5 days. He was extubated on
[**2-16**]. Hct remained stable. He passed some melanotic stools
(expected). He continued on Vanco pr for h/o recent C.diff. On
[**2-21**], a feeding tube was placed and tube feeds were started.

On [**2-22**], he transferred out to the Med-[**Doctor First Name **] ([**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10). He
require aggressive respiratory management with aggressive
incentive spirometry, nebs, chest PT. On [**2-23**], he was somnolent
and O2 sats were in the 88%range. He was pan-cultured and CXR
done. CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions and
atelectasis. UA was positive. He was started on Ciprofloxacin.
Urine culture isolated Enterobacter aerogenes sensitive to
Cipro. A 5 day course was ordered for Cipro.

Respiratory status improved. Foley was removed and a condom cath
was applied. PT worked with him and recommended rehab. He
required [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift to get OOB to chair. On [**2-26**], feeding tube
was inadvertently pulled out. A video swallow was then done by
Speech therapy which he failed. The following was noted:
moderate-severe oropharyngeal dysphagia as described above
including aspiration of thin and
nectar thick liquids and pharyngeal residue of solids as well as
evidence of his known esophageal dysmotility.  Safest
recommendation remains NPO with continued non-oral
nutrition,hydration, and medication during his acute admission.
Of note, he was coughing up (with chest PT/vibration)green
phlegm. Repeat CXR was negative for pneumonia. O2 NC @2L was
continued with sats in 92-94% range.

On [**2-26**], feeding tube was replace, however, this clogged during
the night. Several attempts were replaced, but were unsuccessful
due to patient being unable to tolerate. The decision was made
to start TPN and re-assess next week. He remained NPO. PR Vanco
for h/o C.diff finished on [**2-22**]. Last BM was on [**2-26**].

Abdominal JP drains were removed on [**2-19**] and [**2-26**]. Right sided
ABD drain site appeared red due to drain irritation. Abdominal
incision appeared pink at staple insertion sites on right side
where he also had some swelling and pain to touch. Swelling was
felt to be due to a seroma that was required no intervention at
this time. He will f/u with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**3-7**].

The plan is to transfer to [**Hospital **] Rehab in [**Location (un) 701**]. PO meds
were held. Atenolol was switched to IV Lopressor and IV Cipro
was continue for a total of 10 days (stop date [**3-3**]) for UTI and
respiratory status. Last non-bloody BM was [**2-26**].
