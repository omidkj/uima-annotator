History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 F with h/o htn, asthma, gerd, IBS, gait d/o who
initially p/w fever, SOB, s/p fall X 2 with generalized
weakness. She was admitted on [**2168-12-10**] for increasing SOB, fevers
and s/p fall. Initial imaging-Head CT negative, initial CXR
found to have a large L-sided pleural effusion. Per Chest CT
noted to have loculated pleural effusion and lungs that appeared
to be tacked to pleural surface. Diagnostic Thoracentesis
(5-10cc) clear fluid grew out Strep Milleri, sensitivities
pending. She was started on Levo ([**12-11**]) and Flagyl([**12-12**]) for LLL
PNA. She's remained febrile although fever curve trending down.
Per CT surge she underwent a VATS on [**12-15**]. Intra-op 1 liter of
straw colored fluid removed from L-pleural space, partial lung
decortication & removal of pleural fibrin, also ~400cc estimated
blood loss. 2 Chest Tubes were placed in L pleural space-left to
water suction.  She received 1 UPRBC intra-op. She was extubated
post operatively but remained on Neosynephrine for low SBP.
.
PACU Course: Pt was mentating well, only c/o some chest
discomfort at site of L Chest tubes. She denied any
CP/Palpitations. Her SOB seemed improved to her. She denied any
N/V/Abdominal pain. No diarrhea. No dysuria. No HA/Confusion.

Radiologic Data:
[**12-10**] CT C-spine
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture. Degenerative changes. Loss of
normal cervical lordosis is likely positional due to patient's
spine collar.
[**12-10**] CT head:
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No
fracture
identified.
[**12-10**] CT pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Grade 2 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5. This is increased
compared with prior exam dated [**2162-6-28**], at which time it was
grade 1. The acuity of this displacement is not clearly defined
on the CT scan.
2. Small left pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis at
the left lower lobe.
3. Dense atherosclerosis.
.
[**12-10**] CXR (PA/Lat)
IMPRESSION: Large left pleural effusion. Associated left lower
lobe
consolidation could be secondary to compressive atelectasis,
however, an underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.  .
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2168-12-21**] 3:38 PM
Right PICC line has been placed, with tip terminating in the mid
superior vena cava. Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. CHF has
improved. Left retrocardiac consolidation is also slightly
improved. A moderate left and small right pleural effusions are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Right PICC line terminates in superior vena cava.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old woman with history of asthma, HTN,
GERD, and gait disorder who presented with falls, fever, and
found to have LLL PNA with loculated parapneumonic effusion
requiring VATS decortication. Hospital course was complicated by
post-operative hypotension requiring pressors and admission to
the MICU. She was stabilized and moved to the general medical
floor for further treatment of cultures growing Strep Milleri.
.
#) Community Acquired Pneumonia with Loculated Parapneumonic
effusion:
Strep Milleri from diagnostic thoracentesis. She was treated
initially with levofloxacin and metronidazole and underwent
VATS-decortication and chest tube placement. Given
post-operative hypotension, antibiotic coverage was broadened to
Clindamycin/Vancomycin/Ciprofloxacin. Upon stabilization and
transfer to the floor her she was changed to vancomycin. Strep
Milleri did not successfully grow in culture and sensitivity
data was not able to be obtained. PICC line was placed for
planned 14 day course of vancomycin. She has 7 days remaining of
vancomycin therapy at time of discharge.
.
.
#)Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy:
The patient's initial chest CT noted mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. Though this is likely reactive in the setting
of parapneumonic effusion, an interval chest CT should be
obtained 1 month following discharge.

.
#. Hypotension:
Most likely in setting of volume loss and volume shifts as 1L
fluid was removed from VATS in addition to 400cc blood loss
intra-op. Pt responded well to IV fluids in PACU w/transient
period off NEO once arrived to MICU.  No evidence of cardiac
etiology-no EKG changes, no changes in cardiac enzymes. No
tachycardia, no CP, or changes in O2 require to suggest PE.
Lactate level was not elevated. Pt was weaned from pressors
without incident.
.
#) Asthma:
No PFT data available on admission, with history seemed more
consistent with chronic obstructive lung disease. We maximized
therapy with singulair, pulmicort neb, ipratropium nebulizer,
albuterol nebulizer. If not already obtained, the patient should
have outpatient PFT's to guide management in the future.

.
#) Fall:
CT head on admission without any evidence of bleeding. No focal
neurological deficits.
.
#) Anemia:
Iron studies consistent with acute inflammatory state. Had 1
Unit PRBC transfused intraoperively. Pt's hematocrit was
trending upwards at time of discharge. Stools guaiac negative.

.
#) Hyperglycemia:
Patient had elevated BG's in the setting of acute infection as
no history of diabetes. We measured her finger sticks QID, and
maintained humalong sliding scale as needed. At time of
discharge she did not have an insulin requirement.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia:  we continued atorvastatin
.
#) Chronic back pain: we continued neurontin
.
#) Code Status:
The patient is Full code (discussed w/patient in MICU and
w/grandaughter-HCP [**Doctor First Name 6480**]
