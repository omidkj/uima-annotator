CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Epigastric pain and bloating.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76-year-old male with
history of coronary artery disease with a history of inferior
wall myocardial infarction in [**2093**] status post CABG in [**2093**]
and a redo CABG in [**2111**], who is admitted on [**2124-7-17**] for
three days of persistent epigastric discomfort.  Patient at
this point denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, fevers, chills, or sweats.  The patient
complained of increased bloating and belching not similar to
anginal pains that he had experienced in the past.  He denied
having any chest pain for the past 12 years.

On [**2124-7-19**], patient was awoken from his sleep
complaining of [**10-13**] anginal chest pain.  Electrocardiogram
was without evidence of ST segment elevations.  Initial
cardiac enzymes were negative on admission, however, now were
significant for troponin-T elevation from 0.54 to 0.85.
However, his CPK of 129 was trending down.  Echocardiogram
was performed, and patient was found to have ejection
fraction of 25%, PA systolic pressure of 58, which is
elevated and a new 4+ mitral regurgitation.  Patient was then
referred for a catheterization.

In the Catheterization Laboratory, angiography revealed a 90%
stenosis of proximal saphenous vein graft to his right
coronary artery, and 80% stenosis of his distal LIMA.  Stent
was placed on the proximal region of his saphenous vein graft
with no evidence of residual stenosis and result in TIMI III
flow.  The patient was started on Integrilin and milrinone
and transferred to the CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.  Patient has inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2093**] status post CABG.  LIMA to D1, saphenous
vein graft to LAD, saphenous vein graft to RCA, status post
redo CABG in [**2111**].  Patient has also had a catheterization in
[**2122-1-20**] showing patent grafts with 50% touchdown of
LIMA occlusion.  Noted to have a pressure gradient across his
left subclavian artery.
2. Peripheral vascular disease status post CABG [**2124-6-13**] with
left renal stent placed for renal artery stenosis.  [**2124-6-14**]
bilateral iliac stents placed.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Hypertension.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7. Congestive heart failure.  Echocardiogram [**2124-7-19**] shows
ejection fraction of 25%, mitral regurgitation 4+, tricuspid
regurgitation 3+, akinetic left ventricular wall motion and
dilated RV.
8. Bilateral carotid endarterectomies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking approximately 20
years ago, occasional alcohol use, no drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother deceased from cerebrovascular
accident at 50 years of age.  Father deceased from congestive
heart failure at 80 years of age.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 81 q day.
2. Lipitor 10 q day.
3. Cardura 4 q day.
4. Cardizem 240 q day.
5. Toprol 200 q day.
6. Diovan 160 q day.
7. Lasix 40 q day.
8. Potassium chloride 10 q day.
9. Niacin 1,000 mg q day.
10. Prilosec 20 q day.
11. Fish oil 4,000 units q day.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO CCU:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.0, blood pressure 95/39, heart rate 68, respiratory rate
20, 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula, PA diastolic pressure was
10.  Patient was generally laying in bed and calm in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Positive bilateral carotid bruits,
positive elevated jugular venous pressure.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate, S1, S2 present, [**3-9**] holosystolic murmur at the
apex and left sternal border.  Lungs:  Decreased breath
sounds bilaterally, crackles noted at the anterior bases
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Pulses 2+, no edema
and right femoral line placed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 76-year-old male with
coronary artery disease now with elevated troponins and
occlusion of his saphenous vein graft to his right coronary
artery, status post stent placement with no evidence of
residual stenosis.  The patient was started on milrinone drip
for afterload reduction and fluid status was monitored.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was continued on the milrinone drip
for afterload reduction with the understanding that mitral
regurgitation may decrease and improve perfusion.  In terms
of ischemia, the patient denied any further chest pain.  No
electrocardiogram changes were noticed.  The patient was
continued on his aspirin and Plavix.

Patient was noted to have ectopic beats on milrinone drip.
Therefore, drip was titrated down and the patient was started
on captopril 6.25 tid.  Patient also received 1 unit of
packed red blood cells for a drop in his hematocrit from 25.8
corrected to 31.6.  On admission to the CCU, patient's chest
x-ray showed pulmonary vascular congestion.  He received 100
mg of IV Lasix for diuresis as well as continued on captopril
for afterload reduction.  Patient was initially on a high O2
requirement requiring a nonrebreather face mask, however,
patient was diuresed and afterload reduced, patient's O2
requirement decreased and eventually the patient was 100% on
room air.

In terms of his rhythm, patient converted between atrial
fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm, and demonstrated
evidence of paroxysmal atrial flutter as well as premature
atrial contractions, however, patient's rhythm is corrected
on its own.  The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm,
however, due to his current ischemia and dilated left atrium,
the patient was started on Coumadin to prevent thrombus
formation.

In terms of the patient's renal function, his creatinine was
elevated to 2.2 on admission to the CCU with afterload
reduction, increased perfusion of the kidneys, and
appropriate diuresis, patient's creatinine trended down to
1.6 and is currently improving.  Patient also complained of
dysuria.  Her urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase
and nitrates.  The patient was not started on antibiotics,
but was given trial of Pyridium for symptomatic relief.
Patient will not be started on antibiotics unless urine
culture is positive.  Urine culture is currently pending.

Repeat echocardiogram showed dilated left atrium with
diameter of 5.7 cm.  Left ventricular wall showed basal and
mid inferior akinesis, dilated RV and LV which was larger
than on previous examination, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation without significant change, and an
ejection fraction of 20-25%.

In terms of plan of this patient:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Coronary artery disease and status post PCI with saphenous
vein graft to his RCA.  He will be continued on aspirin,
Plavix, Lipitor.

B. Pump:  Ejection fraction of 25%, 4+ mitral regurgitation,
dilated left ventricle and right ventricle, and dilated left
atrium.  The patient is at increased risk for atrial
fibrillation given LA size and ischemia.  The patient will be
continued on warfarin and continued on ACE inhibitor for
afterload reduction.

C. Rhythm:  As stated before, the patient will be continued
on his Coumadin for risk of atrial fibrillation, atrial
flutter, and will be sent home with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor on
discharge.

2. Gout:  Patient had episode of pain consistent with gout in
his left big toe.  Podagra was relieved with colchicine 0.6
mg prn.  Patient no longer complains of pain.  Patient has
had diagnosis of gout in the past, and has been treated
successfully with Indocin, however, at the time of treatment,
the patient's kidney function was not at baseline, therefore
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories cannot be initiated.  The
patient has been successful with colchicine treatment.

3. Renal:  Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase or
nitrate.  Dysuria is likely secondary to due to inflammation
and trauma from the Foley.  The patient was given a
pres
