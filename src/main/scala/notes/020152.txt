his L foot.  He reports that he has had seizures from alcohol
withdrawl in the past.

received 30mg IM toradol for foot pain, 5mg diazepam PO, 45mg
valium IV over 4 hours, and was then started on an ativan drip

LEFT FOOT, THREE VIEWS: Again seen is the oblique fracture
through the base of the left second metatarsal. There remains
minimal lateral displacement of the distal fracture fragment.
There is a small amount of new periosteal bone formation
consistent with interval healing. The fracture line remains
evident. No other fractures are identified. The joint spaces are
preserved. IMPRESSION: Early healing of fracture through the
base of the second metatarsal.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 47yoM with chronic EtOH use complicated by dilated
cardiomyopathy, cocaine use, hypothyroidism, hypertension and
medication nonadherence, presenting with foot pain and EtOH
withdrawal.  Following issues addressed on this admission:

1. Alcohol withdrawal:
- Patient admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] [**8-29**]
- Initially 45mg iv valium in er and then ativan drip.  Required
very large doses of valium for withdrawal over [**8-30**] and [**8-31**].
By [**8-31**], more stable, transferred to floor and maintained on q2
hour CIWA. This was gradually titrated off by [**9-4**].
- patient has a concominant anxiety disorder, which causes his
CIWA to be more positive that it probably is from alcohol
withdrawal.

2. Alcohol dependence:
- Patient expressed desire for abstinence
- SW and addictions consult services have been involved on
patient's previous admissions.
- SW provided patient with multiple resources for help with
abstinence.  Patient did not qualify for dual diagnosis
inpatient admission given patient was detoxed on medical service

      -discussed with psychiatry on call.
- Patient is making an appointment for structured outpatient
program
- Maintained on thiamine, folate.

3. Chronic Systolic HEart Failure:
- Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy: maintained on digoxin, lisionopril.

- Dig level checked on [**9-4**] and within normal limits.
- However, given his poor compliance, am choosing to stop
digoxin, as it is really just for symptomatic relief and
prevention of admissions, rather than change in mortality, and
failure to comply with therapy safely is more dangerous vs. the
benefits
- No beta blocker given history of cocaine abuse.

4. Benign Hypertension:
- Maintained on lisinopril,
- Normotensive

5. Hypothyroidism:
- maintained on levothyroxine 75

6. Foot pain:
- due to old fracture
- Maintained on oxycodone
- Patient refused to wear soft cast while in house.

7. Smoking:
- Nicotine patch in house
- Counseling on cessation provided, cessation advised.
