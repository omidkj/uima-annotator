CXR:
PA AND LATERAL CHEST: There is increased patchy opacity in the
right lower
lobe consistent with right lower lobe infiltrate. The left lung
and right
upper lung are clear. There is no effusion or pneumothorax.
Heart size is
within normal limits.

IMPRESSION: Increased right lower lobe density consistent with
recurrent
pneumonia most likely due to aspiration. Please follow-up to
clearance.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] is a 63 yo M w/hx COPD and schizophrenia who is
admitted for fevers and leukocytosis with RLL infiltrate
consistent with pneumonia.
.
Pneumonia, recurrent, with acute hypoxic respiratory failure:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79627**] was admitted with pneumonia, right lung, in the
same location as previously this summer, on prior admissions
with significant leukocytosis.  This was thought to reflect
either aspiration event, or possibly recurrent pneumonia,
possibly post-obstructive.  He was initially placed on
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. He then developed
acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which required ICU admission.
At that point, his antibiotic coverage was broadened to cover
pseudomonas and MRSA with Zosyn and Vancomycin. In the MICU, he
was on BIPAP for approximately 2 hours, which he did not
tolerate, and then was transitioned back to nasal cannula.  He
was transferred to the floor three days prior to discharge.
Urine legionella was negative. Sputum cultures were checked and
grew normal flora.
Due to concern for aspiration, he was seen by the speech and
swallow service, and had a video swallow evaluation.  This
revealed no evidence of aspiration.  He was maintained on a
regular diet.   Given the recurrent nature of the pneumonia, he
will require further imaging in 4 weeks, either CT or xray, to
verify resolution of the pneumonia.
.
COPD exacerbation: he was given albuterol and ipratropium
nebulizer treatments, and started on prednisone 60 mg daily.
When transferred to the MICU, he was started on IV solumedrol
for 3 days.  He was then transitioned back to PO prednisone.  He
was also on nebulizers.  He will be restarted on advair and
spiriva at discharge, as well as a prednisone taper.  He will
also require home oxygen.
.
Schizophrenia:  He was maintained on risperdal, and overall his
mental status was stable.  He was at times anxious, but had a
very calm demeanor in his last 3 days of hospitalization.
.
Disposition:  He was noted to be unkempt on admission. He was
seen by social work, and home services and evaluation was
arranged.
