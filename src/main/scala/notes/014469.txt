Admission Date:  [**2130-11-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2130-11-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2062-5-3**]     Sex:  M


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
male without any prior pulmonary history except for asthma,
aspirin sensitivity, and nasal polyps who was transferred
from an outside hospital to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
multilobar infiltrates, congestive heart failure, and
questionable atypical pneumonia.

The patient had previously been in his usual state of health
until [**11-17**] when he began to experience a "flu-like"
illness that was associated with high fevers, cough,
shortness of breath, dyspnea, and nausea with a decreased

At the outside hospital, the patient was found to have
bilateral interstitial infiltrates in the lower lobes and was
treated with a course of several different antibiotics.  The
patient became increasingly short of breath and was noted on
hospital day three to be in rapid atrial fibrillation to a
rate of 160s.  At that time, the patient was started on a
diltiazem drip and was started on Lovenox on [**2130-11-19**].  An echocardiogram at this time showed a reduced
ejection fraction of 40%.

The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation of his hypoxemia and
new onset atrial fibrillation; followed by the addition of
ceftriaxone.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Nasal polyps.
2.  Aspirin allergy.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
5.  History of inflammatory arthritis.
6.  Status post umbilical hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications on admission to the
outside hospital)
1.  Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Flonase.
3.  Fluticasone 110 mcg 2 puffs inhaled b.i.d.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Azithromycin, cefepime, diltiazem
drip, Lovenox, digoxin, and Flagyl.

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] reports
a 60-pack-year smoking history.

FAMILY HISTORY:   There is no family history of coronary
artery disease.  No pulmonary disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature was 99, heart rate was in
the 90s (in atrial fibrillation), blood pressure was 150/96,
respiratory rate was 22, and the patient was saturating at
94% on 5 liters nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was
alert.  Spoke in full sentences and in moderate discomfort.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
sclerae were anicteric.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear.  There was no
jugular venous distention.  No thyromegaly, and no
lymphadenopathy.  Chest examination was clear to auscultation
except for right greater than left inspiratory crackles.
There was no egophony.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  An
irregular rate and rhythm.  There was a normal point of
maximal impulse.  There were no murmurs.  The abdomen was
mildly distended, diffuse tympany, with no shifting dullness.
 No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity examination was notable
for 1+ edema.  On neurologic examination, the cranial nerves
were intact with 5/5 strength in all four extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
upon admission at the outside hospital revealed white blood
cell count was 9.2, hematocrit was 29.3, and platelets of
325.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 133, potassium was 4.3,
chloride was 105, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was
9, creatinine was 1.1.  INR was 1.5, partial thromboplastin
time was 32.3.  A blood gas on admission was 144/31/76.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 0.73.  A digoxin level
of 0.6.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted with
fevers, multilobar infiltrates, and a depressed left
ventricular ejection fraction, with an admission chest x-ray
consistent with congestive heart failure with a good response
clinically to Lasix.  In terms of infectious etiology,
atypical pneumonia was most likely.  The patient was admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring of his
respiratory status and heart rate.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  The patient was diagnosed with
pneumonia at outside hospital.  A chest x-ray upon admission
to the [**Hospital1 69**] was more
consistent with congestive heart failure.

The patient was initiated on levofloxacin.  He remained
afebrile with no increase in white blood cell count
throughout the remainder of his hospital stay.  The patient
was continued on levofloxacin for a 10-day course of
treatment.  Of note, a high-resolution computed tomography
was not performed given the patient's clinical improvement.

Prior to discharge, levofloxacin was discontinued and the
patient was started on azithromycin secondary to interference
with Coumadin.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's hypoxemia
and chest x-ray were consistent with congestive heart
failure.  The patient was diuresed with Lasix with
improvement of his hypoxemia status post diuresis.  As a
result, the patient's oxygen was titrated down.

An echocardiogram was notable for [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement and
an ejection fraction of 60%.  There was no left ventricular
hypertrophy.  There were normal pulmonary pressures.  Normal
right ventricular cavity and wall motion.  There was 1+
mitral regurgitation.

Given these findings, it was likely that the patient's
congestive heart failure was due to a combination of possible
diastolic function in the setting of new onset atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was diuresed as needed throughout
the remainder of his hospital stay.  Of note, the patient was
titrated to room air prior to discharge.

3.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  Upon admission, the patient
was found to be in what was thought new onset atrial
fibrillation.  Also of note, on hospital day one, the patient
had telemetry strips that appeared to reveal nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.

With regard to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, an
echocardiogram was performed, and Cardiology was consulted.
Related to a pulmonary process.  It was felt that the patient
had atrial fibrillation with a rate-dependent aberrancy.

Given the possible underlying etiologies of a pulmonary
infection and congestive heart failure, a cardioversion was
not performed at this time.  The patient was continued on
diltiazem and initiated on Coumadin therapy.  The patient was
also started on Lovenox at the same time and was continued on
Lovenox until INR was therapeutic.  The patient was to follow
up with Cardiology in four to six weeks after discharge for
possible cardioversion at that time.  There was no indication
for further Electrophysiology evaluation during this
admission.  The patient was to follow up for an INR check
with his primary care physician.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient was titrated up on
diltiazem for improvement of rate control.  The patient was
also placed on digoxin for improved rate control.  However,
after further discussion with Cardiology, the digoxin was
discontinued and the patient was initiated on metoprolol 25
mg p.o. b.i.d. with good rate control prior to discharge.
The patient was also to follow up with his primary care
physician with regard to INR levels status post discharge.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Pneumonia.
