Chief Complaint:
confusion, fall

Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
81 year old man with CAD s/p CABG, AF s/p pacemaker, CVA,
dementia presented to the Emergency Department from nursing home
with 1 day of increasing confusion and a fall. Per daughter
patient had fallen in bathroom. Found wearing only a towel--had
apparently been using toilet; further details unknown. Pt had
been off home medications Initial evaluation was unremarkable
with normal vital signs; laboratories only notable for mild
leucocytosis. Anticipated that he would be returned to the
nursing home.
Soon thereafter, the patient was found to be unresponsive and
cyanotic. Code called. Pt initially in PEA and then in VF
arrest. Shocked once and given one round of epinephrine and of
atropine. Pt intubated. BP and P reportedly returned. Shortly
thereafer the patient went again into VF arrest. Shocked once
and received one round of epinephrine and atropine. Pulse and
pressure returned. Central line (R IJ) placed. Cooling protocol
initiated. Pt did not require pressors.
VBG on vent 7.32/46/83/25, lactate 2.3. Chest X-ray
unremarkable. CTA without evidence of PE or dissection. Bedside
echo performed by cardiology fellow revealed akinesis of
anterior wall.


Past Medical History:

50% then
- 50+ year smoking history
- hemorrhagic effusion
- sick sinus requiring DDD pacing in [**2123**]

Pertinent Results:
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-4-28**] 9:00 AM
FINDINGS: The alignment is normal. There is no evidence of
fracture. There is cerumen in both external auditory canals,
suggest clinical correlation for hemotympanum. The vertebral
body heights are preserved. There is ossification of the
posterior longitudinal ligament. There are subchondral cysts and
osteophytes throughout the cervical spine both anteriorly and
posteriorly. There is some foramenal narrowing due to
uncovertebral and facet joint hypertrophy at C2-3 (right >
left), C3-4 (left > right), C4-5 (left > right) and bilaterally
at C5-6. There are dystrophic changes anterior to the spinous
processes, causing very mild canal stenosis at C4-C5. There is
no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. There are blebs at the
left lung apex and paraseptal emphysema.
IMPRESSION: No fracture. Multilevel degenerative change as
detailed above. Blebs at the left lung apex.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2133-4-28**] 8:49 AM
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect or edema. There is marked cerebral atrophy. There is
thickened mucosa in bilateral maxillary sinuses. There is small
vessel ischemic disease. There is no evidence of fracture.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CT Head w/ Contrast [**2133-5-5**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, edema, or
large vascular territory infarction. Prominence of the sulci and
ventricles is again noted, consistent with age-related
involutional changes. Regions of periventricular white matter
hypoattenuation are consistent with small vessel ischemic
disease. Hypodensity in the right basal ganglia is consistent
with old lacunar infarct. Calcifications are again noted in the
cavernous carotid arteries. No fractures are seen. Mild mucosal
thickening is again noted in bilateral maxillary sinuses.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process. Mild
bilateral maxillary sinus mucosal thickening again noted.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2133-4-28**] 3:34 PM
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: An endotracheal tube is noted.
The heart is enlarged. Coronary artery calcifications are seen.
The pulmonary artery is normal in size without filling defects
to suggest pulmonary embolism. The ascending aorta demonstrates
calcifications within the wall without evidence of dissection.
There is a left apical paraseptal bullae. Bilateral dependent
atelectasis is identified. There are small pleural effusions,
left greater than right. There is no pneumothorax or
consolidation. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
lymphadenopathy.
This study is not designed for evaluation of the abdomen,
however, the visualized portions of the upper abdomen are
unremarkable. The patient is status post CABG.
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.
Extensive degenerative changes of the spine are identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolism or thoracic aortic
dissection.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = <20 %) with
contraction best at the base of the heart. No LV apical thrombus
is seen. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with contraction best at the base of the
heart (?stress-induced cardiomyopathy vs. large LAD territory
infarct). Mild right ventricular dilation with mild global
hypokinesis. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had an 80% ostial stenosis.
--the LAD had a 50% mid-vessel stenosis.  D
