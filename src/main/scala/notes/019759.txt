Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for consideration of CABG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CABG x5 (LIMA>LAD, SVG>DIAG, SVG>RAMUS>YGRAFT>OM, SVG>PDA) [**12-12**]


History of Present Illness:
53 y/o M w/ hx CAD with known unvascularized 3VD, chronic
systolic HF with EF 20%, DM, hyperlipidemia, hx of CVA,
asthma/COPD, with recent prolonged hospitalization at [**Hospital1 **] for
inferior MI, cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, VAP and ARF
who is being transferred from OSH for consideration of CABG.
The pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 498**] on [**9-8**] for IMI and resp failure.
During this hospitalization, he required intermittent dopamine
for cardiogenic shock and was unable to be weaned from vent. He
had a cardiac cath on [**9-25**] demonstrating severe 3VD and global
ventricular dysfunction and an EF 20% and no MR. Because of his
other complicating medical issues, he was determined to not be a
candidate for stenting or CABG. He was discharged to rehab and 2
days later he pt represented to another hospital with 9/10 CP.
His EKGs were reportedly unchanged from prior, had flat cardiac
enzymes and was medically managed with ACEI, lipitor, but no BB.
 Pt was not able to be weaned from vent so was transferred back
to rehab after having a trach and PEG placed. He was either then
discharged or signed out AMA from rehab.
.
He then presented to [**Hospital1 10478**] ED early this am with severe
respiratory distress and chest pain, failed BIPAP, and required
intubation. Prior to intubation, the pt had an episode of black
coffee ground emesis. A NGL lavage was performed with aspiration
of dark material that was guaiac positive. His Hct dropped from
36.9 --> 30.5.  He had diffuse pulm infiltrates that improved
with 1.5 L diuresis but briefly dropped his pressures to the
80s.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

BRIEF HISTORY:
The patient is a 53 yo male transferred from an outside hospital
with an
NSTEMI, congestive heart failure now intubated with known severe
three
vessel disease and transferred for CABG. The patient is now s/p
PEA
arrest on [**2166-11-22**].
.
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, Canadian Heart Class IV,  unstable.
Prior
MI.
.
PROCEDURE:
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
left femoral vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge pressure
catheter,
advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French introducing
sheath.
Cardiac output was measured by the Fick method.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation: was initiated with an
introducer
sheath using a Cardiac Assist 9 French 30cc wire guided
catheter,
inserted via the left femoral artery.
Peripheral Imaging was performed.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed a
normal
LMCA, 70% proximal stenosis in the LAD, 80% distal LAD stenosis
and 80%
stenosis in D1. The LCX was totally occluded. The RCA had a 70%
mid
stenosis, 80% stenosis of the right PDA and total occlusion
after the
PDA.
.
2. Peripheral arteriography revealed a right iliac artery that
was
patent and a left iliac artery with a 60% stenosis without a
gradient of
flow.
.
3. Hemodynamics revealed low-normal systemic arterial pressures
with an
SBP of 103 mm Hg. The RVEDP was elevated at 14 and the PASP was
56. The
PCWP was 28 mm Hg for which 40 mg IV lasix was given.
.
4. An IABP was placed without complication in the left groin.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2 . Acute infero-posterior myocardial infarction, managed by
IABP.

Echo [**12-9**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior and lateral akinesis
(estimated ejection fraction ?30-35%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

No vegetation seen (cannot exclude; views are technically
suboptimal)
