History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32978**] is an 83 yo man with pmhx CAD s/p multiple stents,
Afib, CHF with EF 30%, s/p prophylactic AICD in [**2173**], HTN,
hyperlipidemia who presented from his nursing home with
sustained VTach. Patient reports that this morning he was "not
feeling well and unable to get confortable." He is unable to
provide any more specific details but endorses feeling short of
breath. He denies any chest pain. He did not lose consciousness.
Family states that nursing staff found him to be tachypneic,
tachycardic, and hypotensive.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for the presence of ankle
edema and dyspnea on exertion. It is notable for the absence of
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], BP 86/50, HR 125-130, SpO2 84-85% on RA. On arrival
to ED at [**Hospital1 18**], T 97.8, HR 129, BP 90/45, RR 20, SpO2 99%. In
the ED, rhythm spontaneously conveted to atrial fibrillation
with a rate in the 70's. Device was interrogated by EP fellow,
revealing no detected VT. CXR was performed and patient received
ASA 325 mg.

CXR performed on [**2175-10-29**] demonstrated:
1. Enlarging moderate pleural effusions.
2. Persistent bibasilar opacities which may represent
atelectasis and/or airspace consolidation.
3. Mild central pulmonary vascular congestion with no evidence
of alveolar edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
VT: Patient presented with recurrence of sustained ventricular
tachycardia on amiodarone + digoxin + Toprol. ICD interrogation
revealed that his Vtach was not detected due to irregularithy of
the rhythm (e.g., interspersed PVC's).  Following transfer he
spontaneously converted to atrial fibrillation.  His ICD was
reprogrammed at this time to fire at a rate of 110, and he was
started on Mexilitine, and continued on amiodarone. He persisted
in having VT that was not sensed by the ICD. He was put on a
lidocaine drip, which controlled the VT. After further
conversations with the family, he was made DNR/DNI, and but
defibrillation in the VT zone were kept on. He does not want
external defibrillation. Additionally, VT zone detection was
made more sensitive (8 beats, 12 redetect). Lidocaine was dc/ed.
 He was continued on mexilitine to medically reduce further
episodes of VT.  Digoxin was discontinued as it was felt that
digoxin could potentially contribute to increased
arrhythmogenicity.  His beta blocker was reduced due to
hypotension.  He was continued on anticoagulation for his
underlying atrial fibrillation.
.
Acute on chronic systolic CHF: On admission, he was found to be
fluid overloaded.  Heart failure exacerbation was in the setting
of VT and increased cardiac demand.  A repeat echocardiogram
showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30
%).  He was diursed with IV lasix and was relatively euvolemic
on discharge.  He was discharged on lasix 120 po daily.
.
CAD:  He had a small troponin leak in the setting of VT.  His
CAD was medically managed with ASA, statin, beta blocker.
.
Anemia: On admission, his Hct was found to be 27.  His hct
normalized to his baseline of ~30-31 on discharge.  Iron studies
revealed anemia of chronic illness.  Epo was discontinued as he
had no evidence of renal insufficiency, and no indication for
it.  Iron was also discontinued as there was no evidence for
iron deficiency anemia.
.
Pneumonia: found on chest x ray, sputum cultures showing MSSA.
patient started on vanc/zosym. changed to ceftriazone when
sensitivities came back
.
UTI: Patient was he was found to have a klebsiella UTI for which
he was started on bactrim, which was dc/ed when he started
treatment for pneumonia. he is currently on ceftriazone.
