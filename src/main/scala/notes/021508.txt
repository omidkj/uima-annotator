EAST HOSPITAL MEDICINE ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE

Date: [**2110-1-10**]
Time: 23:45

The patient is a 62 y/o M with PMHx of paranoid Schizophrenia,
COPD, colon cancer in remission s/p colectomy with liver wedge
resection, recurrent biliary obstruction s/p >30 ERCPs in past 7
years (with plan for repeat [**Month/Day/Year **] next week) presents to the ED
with fever.

Patient reports fever to 101 at home today.  Also with nausea
(no vomiting) and generalized weakness. He denies any abdominal
pain or diarrhea. No change in color of skin or urine. He
endorses dysuria. He also reports one month of URI symptoms, was
diagnosed with acute sinusitis by his PCP last week and was
taking a three week course of amoxicillin, which he said
improved his symptoms. He also endorses mild SOB at rest, which
is worse with movement. His chronic cough is unchanged.  He
denies chest pain, orthopnea, pnd or LE edema.

He requires ERCPs every 3-4 months for removal of biliary
sludge. In [**2108-7-29**], he required ICU for cholangitis and
septic shock (on pressors).

Regarding patient's schizophrenia, he endorses racing thoughts
but denies any SI or HI.

In ED: 100.5  98P  123/76  16  99%RA; he was given Unasyn and
tylenol. Labs showed elevated tbili 2.0, ruq u/s done (read
pending). [**Year (4 digits) **] was consulted.

His blood pressures dropped shortly after being admitted and he
was transferred to the ICU, where his antibiotics were broadened
to zosyn and he received IVFs, neosynephrine and levophed, which
were weaned off at 2pm [**2110-1-9**]. He remained hemodynamically
stable off of pressors and IVFs for >24 hours and was
subsequently transferred to the medical floor for further
monitoring.

On the floor, he reported no pain, n/v, diarrhea, cp, sob. He
endorsed insomnia and requested something to help him sleep.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63yo M with PMH of colon cancer s/p colectomy and
liver wedge resection, in remission, paranoid schizophrenia,
emphysema, recurrent biliary obstruction s/p >30 ERCPs, admitted
with fever and hyperbilirubinemia from likely biliary
obstruction and cholangitis.

# Cholangitis: Shortly after admission, patient became
hypotensive with SBP in the 70s, not responsive to several IVF
boluses. Most likely septic shock given fevers and possible
source of biliary tract given elevated transaminases and Tbili.
DDx for shock etiologies include hypovolemic, hemorrhagic or
cardiogenic. Pt appears dry, but without obvious fluid loss this
is less likely. Pt has anemia, but no obvious source of
bleeding. Cardiogenic less likely given lungs clear, JVP flat,
and no evidence of peripheral edema. CVO2 71, lactate 0.8. Given
obstructive picture, cholangitis is most consistent with his
presentation: fevers, elevated bilirubinemia, right upper
quadrant abdominal pain. Patient was transferred to the ICU,
given several more IVF boluses and he was started on
neosynephrine. CVL was placed and patient was transitioned to
levophed with good response. Patient's antibiotics were
broadened to Zosyn for gram negative and anaerobic coverage for
abdominal sources. The following morning patient was taken for
[**Known lastname **] which showed biliary sludge, no frank purulence. Bile duct
was cleared and stent was placed. Patient was weaned off
pressors several hours later and blood pressure remained stable
for the remainder of his ICU stay. On [**1-10**], 1 of 2 blood
cultures from [**1-8**] grew gram negative rods. Sensitivities to
cefepime, ceftriaxone, tobramycin and gentamicin were documented
and thus, the patient was switched to ceftriaxone and then to
cefpodoxime (high dose) with a plan for 14 day total course of
antibiotics.

# Biliary obstruction: Pt with rising bilirubin
