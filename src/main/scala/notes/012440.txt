History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 year-old gentleman with known CAD (cath [**2111**]
showed one vessel disease with 70% distal LCX 90% OM at mid
vessel), dilated cardiomyopathy ( LVEF = 10% at [**Hospital3 **]
compared to 20-25 % in [**2111**] at [**Hospital1 18**]), NSVT status post
[**Company 1543**] AICD placement in [**2102**], and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation on amiodarone and Coumadin. According to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**],
when he last saw him the patient was doing well. However,
despite his most recent cath which showed "single vessel"
disease, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] thinks he has multivessel disease that waxes
and wanes on angiography. The patient has always refused
intervention in the past.

The patient was in his usual state of health until early [**Month (only) 547**]
when he developed an acute CHF exacerbation. He was admitted to
[**Hospital3 4107**] and treated there. He represented to [**Hospital 25163**]
hospital [**2114-3-5**] (current presenatation) after falling out of
his chair while asleep and not being able to get up himself. He
denied preceeding lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations,
shortness of breath, bladder or bowel incontinence, although he
did endorse that he was confused for nearly the entire next day.

At [**Hospital1 **] he was felt to be clinically in CHF with elevated BNP
2880 and pulmonary edema on Chest x ray. He was also found to be
in afib with RVR. He was admitted to the ICU and treated with
lasix gtt, diltiazem gtt, and amiodarone to 200 mg daily. His
lasix dosing was titrated to 100mg IV BID and he was diuresing
well, but developed ARF with creatinine increased from 0.9 on
admission to 2.1. His lasix and spironolactone were held
starting [**2114-3-7**]. LFTs also became acutely elevated ast from 24
to 4139, alt from 37 to 1335. His acute renal failure and
hepatitis were both attributed to ischemic insult from poor
cardiac output. It was also thought that he had acute ischemic
colitis but there was no lab or imaging studies to support this
from the outside hospital. He also was found to have evidence of
a UTI and was started on antibiotics. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-3-8**] for consideration of [**Hospital1 **]-V icd upgrade.

He was admitted to [**Wardname **] and got kayexalate for hyperkalemia of
5.9. The following morning he had an echo (results pending). He
was evaluated by EP who thought he would benefit from BiV
pacing. He underwent persantine perfusion stress test to look
for viability of his left ventricle prior to BiV placement.
Secondary to his elevated liver enzymes his amiodarone was
decreased and his statin and coumadin were also held. Hepatology
was also consulted. He is being transferred to the CCU for
initation of diuresis with inotropes.

ETT [**2114-3-9**]:
INTERPRETATION: 71 yo man with h/o CHF, CAD, atrial
fibrillation,
severe COPD and cardiomyopathy with LVEF of [**8-31**]% was referred
for
evaluation following admission for ? syncopal episode while in
atrial
fibrillation with RVR and CHF exacerbation. The patient was
administered
0.142 mg/kg/min of Persantine over 4 minutes. No chest, back,
neck or
arm discomforts were reported by the patient during the
procedure. The
ECG is uninterpretable for ischemia in the presence of the LBBB.
The
rhythm was sinus with rare isolated VPDs noted. The blood
pressure
response to the Persantine infusion was appropriate. The heart
rate
response to the Persantine infusion was flat. Post-infusion, the
patient
was administered 125 mg Aminophylline IV.

IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG for
