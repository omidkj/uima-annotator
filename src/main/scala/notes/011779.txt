Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Dypsnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
80 y.o. F h/o COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, s/p PPM for Mobitz II,
AAA s/p repair, RAS s/p stent, MRSA bacteremia, presenting with
4 days increasing dyspnea. Began with URI symptoms of rhinorrhea
and cough increasingly productive of gree/yellow sputum. Denies
fevers or night sweats, admits chills once or twice. Daughter
with whom she lives had cold several days before patient's onset
of symptoms. Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] states she had worsening SOB. Saw PCP
yesterday, who added Flovent to her COPD regimen and started
treatment for UTI with Levaquin 250mg PO daily. He also checked
a CXR which had no infiltrate. This morning, dyspnea worsened,
daughter describes patient as "gasping for air", brought to the
ED.

In the ED, initial VS T: 98.2F, BP 177/96, HR: 90, RR: 30, SaO2:
89% RA. Noted to have bilateral expiratory wheezing with
increased respiratory effort. She was given SoluMedrol 125mg IV,
combivent nebs, and covered for possible COPD flare with
vancomycin 1gm IV, CTX 1gm IV, and Azithromycin 500mg PO. She
received ASA 325mg. Wbc 9.1 with 84% PMN, lactate 3.1. BNP
>70,000 (baseline 30,000). Repeat CXR done which showed no
infiltrate, no evidence of pulmonary edema. Ddimer was positive,
and she had a CTA, which demonstrated no evidence of PE or
dissection, but showed peribronchial opacities potentially
concerning for early multifocal PNA.


Past Medical History:
1) Vasculopathy--has history of AAA, s/p endovascular AAA repair

(AAA was 4.7 cm) in [**2109-1-3**]. In [**2112-7-12**] under aortogram,
celiac balloon angioplasty and stent, superior mesenteric artery
stent. She was noted to have endovascular leak in [**10-10**] and
underwent open AAA
repair and RAS stent placed.

STUDIES:
========
[**6-19**] CXR (PA & LATERAL)
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**6-20**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation or possible flutter
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities
These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of the same date, ventricular rate faster


[**6-20**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation or possible flutter
Left ventricular hypertrophy
Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities
These findings are nonspecific but clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2113-5-10**], ventricular paced rhythm
absent

[**6-20**] CXR (PORTABLE)
FINDINGS: There is minimal interval change. The left-sided dual
pacemaker
with leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle
remains
unchanged. Cardiomegaly is moderate and stable. The tortuous
aorta is
unchanged. The lungs are slightly hyperinflated but there is no
infiltrate. There is some linear atelectasis at the bases. There
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**6-20**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Multiple patchy opacities in a bronchovascular pattern seen
as in
bilateral lungs, which are concerning for an early multifocal
pneumonia with adjacent adenopathy, likely reactive.

[**6-21**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with prolonged Q-Tc interval -
cannot exclude in part ischemia - clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2113-6-20**], QRS voltages less prominent
and further ST-T wave changes present

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU SUMMARY:
==============
Ms. [**Known lastname 12056**] is an 80 y.o. F with COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN, s/p PPM
for Mobitz II, AAA s/p repair, RAS s/p stent, MRSA bacteremia,
presenting with 4 days of increasing dyspnea that was preceded
with rhinorrhea and productive cough of green/yellow sputum. She
denied fevers/night sweats, but admits to chills 1-2x. Her
daughter who lives with her also had a cold several days prior
to the patient's onset of symptoms. She had increasing SOB and
saw her PCP the day PTA, who gave her Flovent and started her on
Levaquin for a UTI. A CXR was negative at PCP's office. The
morning of ICU admission, the patient was "gasping for air" and
brought to the ED by her daughter.

In the ED, VS notable for BP 177/96, RR 30 and O2 sat 89% RA.
Noted to have bilateral expiratory wheezing with increased
respiratory effort. Given SoluMedrol 125 mg IV, Combivent nebs,
and covered for COPD flare with vancomycin 1 gm IV, CTX 1 gm IV,
and Azithromycin 500 mg po. Of note, BNP >70,000 (baseline
30,000). CXR showed no infiltrate, no pu
