CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Change in mental status.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old man
with a history of type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure,
coronary artery disease, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea,
depression, and with a history of lower extremity cellulitis,
who presented with four days of mental status change and
falls.  Most of the history was obtained from his sister,
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  The patient also reports one episode of
worsening depression per report from his sister.  The patient
remained in bed most of the time.  The patient had also
recently been on Keflex times seven days for a lower
extremity cellulitis beginning from about [**2114-4-4**],
questionable possible diarrhea while on these antibiotics but
had resolved by the time of admission.  The patient was found
at home by his sister.  [**Name (NI) **] was found to be shaking and had
tremors.  She also noted that he had increased lower
extremity edema as well as erythema on his shins.  She notes
that he had a decreased appetite and decreased urinary output
for these several days.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes:  His hemoglobin A1C from [**2114-4-3**]

grandmother notable for the presence of depression.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been on disability.  He is a
current smoker, smoking a pack per day times the past 35
years.  He does not drink.  He lives alone with the exception
of his dog.  The only social contact is his sister, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 3450**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.2, blood pressure 190/144, heart rate 99, respirations 18,
saturation 97% on room air, 02 saturations dropped to 88% on
1 liter nasal cannula.  Initial K 6.6, creatinine 7.0,
phosphate 10.3, ammonia 61.  ABGs at that time was 7.22, PC02
67, P02 68.

The EKG at the time was notable for questionable atrial
fibrillation versus multifocal atrial tachycardia.

The patient was given 10 mg of IV diltiazem.  His blood
pressure then dropped to 80s systolic at that point.  He had
a left femoral line placed and received 2 liters of normal
saline as well as an amp of bicarbonate, lactulose, calcium
gluconate, Kayexalate, 10 units of regular insulin, as well
as an amp of D50.

On arrival to the floor, her vital signs were as follows:
Temperature 97.2, blood pressure 115/72, saturating 90% on
BIPAP.  General appearance:  He was confused, occasional
twitching, and an obese man.  HEENT:  Difficult to assess.
Notable for some dry mucous membranes.  The heart sounds were
distant.  The heart examination was notable for decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.  Abdomen was notable for morbid
obesity.  Normal bowel sounds were present.  It was
nontender.  The extremities were notable for erythema but no
warmth with blisters on his anterior shins.  Neurologically,
he was confused with occasional twitches.

LABORATORY DATA:  White cell count 11.1, hematocrit 40.3,
baseline in the upper 30s, platelets 315,000.  His
differential was 80% neutrophils, 9% lymphs, 8% monos.  His
Chem-7 was 134, 6.6, 90, 27, 109, 7, and 140 glucose.  His
calcium was 8.2, magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 10.3.  ALT 27, AST
18, total bilirubin 0.2, amylase 142, ammonia 61 at the time.

The chest x-ray was notable for a limited examination due to
poor penetration and possible right lower lobe pneumonia.

The EKG was notable for a right axis deviation, sinus
tachycardia, 104 beats per minute, T waves flipped in aVL and
V6, poor R wave progression but no ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Initially it was felt that the patient's
mental status changes were due to acute renal failure, uremia
with possible COPD narcosis because he is believed to be a
chronic C02 retainer.  The possibility of infection such as
pneumonia could not necessarily be ruled out.

His acute renal failure was believed to be a combination of
dehydration and prerenal state secondary to depression and/or
pneumonia, urinary tract infections, cellulitis.  His hypoxia
was believed to be either pneumonia versus COPD exacerbation,
treated on BIPAP but then due to respiratory failure he was
electively intubated for airway protection.  Blood cultures
were done.  He was empirically started on levofloxacin,
Flagyl, and vancomycin.

During his hospitalization, he had a repeat echocardiogram
which showed LVEF about 30%, right ventricular free wall
motion significantly depressed, and there was some
....................septal motion defect consistent with
ventricular overload.  The patient was also dependent on
pressors believed to be secondary to sepsis.  He was
responsive to boluses as well as stress-dose steroids.  For
his hypokalemia, he was given Kayexalate and urine was
followed.

On [**2114-4-20**], the patient had a hemodialysis catheter
placed after consultation with the Renal Service given that
the patient's renal failure was considered to be a possible
indication for emergent hemodialysis.  However, the patient's
renal failure began to resolve on its own, thus alleviating
the need for hemodialysis.  Urine output was also seen to
improve over the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.

The patient's nutritional status was maintained on tube
feeds.  The patient gradually became more responsive and
consideration made to wean the patient off the vent.  Of
note, it should be stated that the patient was difficult
peripheral status.  Central line placements all required the
need for guidance by ultrasound Dopplers for proper line
placement.  The patient also had an episode over his hospital
course of pulseless V tach which was preceded by atrial
tachycardia.  The patient coded but responded to one shock of
200 joules and reverted back to sinus rhythm.

The patient was started on an Amiodarone drip and then
switched to initially 400 mg of Amiodarone p.o. b.i.d. and
then eventually transitioned to 400 mg of Amiodarone daily.
His blood sugars were difficult to control, believed to
possibly be due to his body habitus as well as edema, with
the concern that subcutaneous heparin was not being absorbed.
The patient was maintained on an insulin drip.

The patient also developed foot blisters first noted on about
[**2114-4-26**] to [**2114-4-27**].  Podiatry was consulted who
felt that these blisters were secondary to his lower
extremity edema rather than pressure blisters per say and so
recommendations for dressings were placed on the blisters.

Attempts were made to wean the patient off the vent.  The
patient lasted as long as five hours on one attempt but
became increasingly tachycardiac and hypercapnic and so
require reintubation which was done fiberoptically by
Anesthesiology.  At this point, it was decided in
consultation with the patient's sister as well as the patient
to undergo a tracheostomy which was performed as a
cooperative effort between Interventional Pulmonology and
