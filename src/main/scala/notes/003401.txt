HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and diabetes, who
was doing well until two days prior to admission when he
began to feel weak.  Patient reported that he felt weak, and
had a "heavy load on his shoulders."  The same thing had
happened the day prior to admission and progressed to the
point, where he could not urinate standing up secondary to
weakness.

On the day of admission, the patient awoke feeling "not good"
and his wife brought him to the Emergency Room.  The patient
reported nausea on the morning of admission which had
resolved by the time he had been to the Emergency Room.
Denied vomiting.  He did report diaphoresis.  He denied back
pain and abdominal pain at the time of admission.  He also
denied diarrhea or constipation.

In the Emergency Room, his vital signs were found to be blood
pressure of 111/55, pulse of 59.  Patient was somewhat
diaphoretic.  His blood pressures dropped to the 100s and he
was given 1 liter of normal saline with good blood pressure
response.  A nasogastric lavage returned evidence of blood
and MICU evaluation was consulted, and the patient was
admitted to the MICU.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, the patient
reported he sleeps on two pillows secondary to discomfort,
but denied PND.  The patient can walk several feet, but has
trouble beyond that.  The patient denied night sweats.
Denied viral symptoms.  Denied any new medications except
starting vitamins.

retired salesman.  Smoked 50 years at two packs per day, but
quit in [**2192**] and denies any alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 98.5,
blood pressure 111/55, pulse is 59, respiratory rate 13, and
sating 95% on room air.  In general, this was an elderly
male, who is pale in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Pale conjunctivae, but
no icterus.  Jugular venous pressure at 10 cm.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, 2/4 systolic
ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border, no
radiation.  Lungs with crackles at the bases bilaterally.
Rectal examination was guaiac positive per the Emergency
Room.  Abdominal examination:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
good bowel sounds, and no palpable masses.  Extremities
revealed trace lower extremity edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Revealed normal sinus rhythm, normal
intervals, T-wave inversions which were old in aVL, V5, and
V6, and poor R-wave progression.  He had slight ST
depressions 1 mm as well.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  Hematocrit of 18.6, white
count 8.4, platelets 20.  Chem-7 was also unremarkable.

Also on admission the patient had a CT scan of his chest and
abdomen.  This was negative for aortic dissection or
aortoenteric fistula.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Anemia:  The anemia was felt likely to be secondary to an
acute on chronic picture.  Chronic being anemia of chronic
disease and in a setting of acute exacerbation namely a GI
bleed.  In addition, it was also considered that there maybe
another source of his anemia given the fact that the patient
also had thrombocytopenia.

The patient was transfused for a goal hematocrit over 28,
ideally over 30.  The patient was originally admitted to the
MICU and given 10 units of packed red blood cells.  The
patient was later transferred to the floor and monitored
there.  He had required multiple transfusions.  Please see GI
section for further details on GI bleed.

The patient's anemia was stable at the time of discharge.  He
had a stable hematocrit for about 48 hours prior to
discharge.  His discharge hematocrit was 33.7.

2. Thrombocytopenia:  The differential for the patient's
thrombocytopenia included medication induced, consumption
with DIC, hemolysis, ITP, TTP, and primary bone marrow issue.
The patient's Protonix was originally held on admission as
this was believed to be possible for causing
thrombocytopenia, however, the patient was restarted on this
prior to discharge when it was ruled out from the
differential diagnosis.  The patient had no evidence of
active hemolysis or DIC.  Question remained whether this was
ITP.

A bone marrow biopsy was performed on the patient which
revealed myelodysplastic syndrome.  It was believed that the
myelodysplastic syndrome accounted for portions of both the
patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia.  The patient was
transfused platelets as needed.  The patient had a stable
platelet count for at least 48 hours prior to discharge.  On
discharge, the platelet count was 165.

3. MDS/Hematology:  As stated above, the patient was both
anemic and thrombocytopenic.  The patient was found to have
MDS on bone marrow biopsy with a question of MDS and ITP.
The patient was treated for his MDS per Hematology/Oncology
recommendations.  This included high-dosed steroids of
prednisone 80 mg q day.  This also included B12, iron, and
folic acid supplementation.

4. GI bleed:  Patient was found to have an active GI bleed
with a positive nasogastric tube lavage.  Once the patient's
hematocrit and platelet counts were stable, he underwent an
endoscopy to evaluate his upper GI bleed.  The patient was
found to have a significant amount of gastritis and also
duodenitis.  Several areas were cauterized at the original
endoscope for better hemostasis.

On the day after the endoscopy, the patient returned to the
Endoscopy Suite for re-evaluation if the patient had
decreased his hematocrit overnight, however, there were no
further sites of active bleeding found.  Colonoscopy was
considered while in-house, however, it was deemed that the
sight of GI bleeding in the stomach and duodenum was
sufficient to account for the patient's blood loss.  The
patient should have a colonoscopy as a followup.

Patient's hematocrit was again stable for 48 hours prior to
discharge.  It was deemed that the GI bleeding was under
control at this time of discharge with a negative endoscope
and also stable hematocrit.  Although the patient's
proton-pump inhibitor had originally been held, it was
started prior to discharge with an alternate diagnosis for
thrombocytopenia had been found.

5. Cardiac:  Patient has an extensive cardiac history.  While
in the MICU, the patient developed back pain.  An
electrocardiogram obtained at that time revealed ST segment
depressions to 3 mm which has increased over the baseline of
1 mm for this patient.  The patient was given sublingual
nitroglycerin with relief of back pain and also the ST
segment depressions.  Serial enzymes were also checked at
that time, and the patient ruled in for myocardial
infarction.

Given the fact that the electrocardiogram changes had
resolved, and the patient was asymptomatic after sublingual
nitroglycerin, it was deemed that this was due to demand
ischemia given the patient's low hematocrit at the time.  The
patient was transfused to maintain a hematocrit greater than
30 to prevent fur
