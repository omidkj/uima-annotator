Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2108**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old woman with a history of asthma, HTN,
DM, a PE in [**2158**] not on anticoagulation and SBOs who presents
with [**Year (4 digits) 9140**] SOB and acute onset of chest pain with radiation
to her back. The patient reports that since [**Holiday **] she
developed a cough productive with clear sputum, slight
congestion, and mild SOB. She denied any fevers or chills. She
states that her SOB worsened over the next week despite the use
of her inhalers. She reports that her activity level decreased
due to progressive SOB to a point where it was difficult to even
ambulate a few steps. Her dyspnea worsened 3 days prior to
admission and today at 11:30am she developed sudden onset of
acute right sided chest pain. She rates the pain [**8-2**],
dull/stabbing, non-pleuritic with radiation straight to her
back. The patient reports that she was on a self-administered
prednisone taper that began 4 days ago with 60mg prednisone
decreasing by 10mg daily. This was rx by her PCP in the event of
[**Month/Year (2) 9140**] SOB.
.
In the ED initial VS were 96.7 hr 72 bp 114/69 rr 20 sats 100
RA. She was noted to be tachypneic. Initial labs were notable
for a K+ of 3.1, a glucose of 215 and no leukocytosis. She was
treated with nebulizers, started on IV 125mg methylpred and
given 40 meq of PO potassium. They were concerned about PE vs
dissection and given her contrast allergy did not pursue CTA.
.
On arrival in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was still having chest pain and
reported feeling SOB. She denied fever, chills and only had a
slight cough.

Radiology
XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2165-11-24**] 10:31 AM
FINDINGS: The lungs are clear. No pneumothorax or pleural
effusion is
present. The cardiac silhouette, hilar, mediastinal contours
appear normal.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary findings.

XR CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2165-11-24**] 12:16 PM
FINDINGS: Compared to the study two hours prior, there has been
no interval change. The lungs are clear. There is no
pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiac
silhouette, hilar, and mediastinal contours appear normal.
IMPRESSION: No acute findings.

MRA CHEST W&W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2165-11-24**] 7:33 PM
FINDINGS: The aorta and great vessels demonstrate normal caliber
and contour throughout. There is no evidence of intramural
hematoma.
The pulmonary arterial tree demonstrates normal opacification
throughout
without evidence of filling defect, up to the level of the third
order of
pulmonary arteries.
There is no evidence of significant mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy.
There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. The
visualized lung fields are unremarkable.
The visualized portions of the liver and pancreas are within
normal limits.
Multiplanar 2D and 3D reconstructions and subtraction images
provided multiple perspectives for the dynamic series (series
308-309).
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of pulmonary embolism and no evidence of aortic
dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old woman with extensive allergy profile, prior PE and
cardiac risk factors, admitted with a [**Date Range 9140**] dyspnea and
acute onset of right sided chest pain. D-dimer was negative and
had MRA chest which showed no dissection or PE. Pain is brought
on by chest wall palpation and extends to the back.  She has had
multiple previous episodes of various pains with multiple
repeated CTAs and CT of the abdomen which have been negative.
Original CTA in [**2158**] showed small PE in a RUL segmental branch.
These sx and multiple previous investigations with various pains
concerning for possible functional overlay to sx.

Dyspnea: possibly related to asthma, she has a history of
childhood asthma and multiple allergies, in addition she has had
normal spirometry but no methacholine challange so it is
possible her asthma is simply not severe enough to lead to
abnormal PFTs which have been performed when the patient is
feeling well. With forced expiration she did have significant
wheezes and her symptoms are not attributable to any other
cause.  She was discharged to finish a steroid taper.

Chest Pain: ruled out for MI, no PE or dissection.  She has a
component of chest wall tenderness which raises the possibility
of costochondritis.  In addition she has significant anxiety and
prn ativan was very helpful fo
