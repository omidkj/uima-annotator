Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  56 y/o female with PMH signficant for type 2 diabetes
mellitus, osteoarthritis, asthma, and chronic paranoid
schizophrenia admitted through the ED with an asthma
exacerbation, s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 153**] stay, now transferred to floor, doing
well.

1. SOB- Asthma exacerbation, Oxygen saturations stable on 4L NC.
Continue nebulizers q4h ATC with prn as necessary. Continue
fluticasone MDI and montelukast. Attempt quick prednisone taper
given her history of difficult to control DM while on steroids.
She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given the severity of the
asthma, where she required q2-3h nebs initially and Prednisone
60 mg.  She was also started on montelukast.  Her symptoms
slowly improved, and she was transferred to the floor when the
frequency of her nebulizer (albuterol, atrovent) was every 4
hours.  She was continued on her steroids, on a very slow taper.
Eventually, her nebulizers were stopped and she was continued on
albuterol MDI with spacer.  She was also started on [**Hospital Unit Name **].  Her
wheezing and air movement were significantly improved at time of
discharge.  She will continue her prednisone taper as an
outpatient and continue with her albuterol and [**Hospital Unit Name **] MDIs.  She
will follow up with her PCP.

2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus- Poorly controlled on steroids. Her
NPH dose was increased, and her sliding scale was adjusted as
necessary. Her blood sugars were persistently elevated which was
thought to be secondary to steroids and dietary non-compliance.
She was discharged on an increased dose of NPH and instructed to
check her sugars 4 times daily, treat with regular insulin as
necessary.

3. [**Name (NI) 3687**] Pt with a history of schizoaffective disorder vs
depression with psychotic features. No halluciantions or
delusions at the present time. Psychiatry saw her in-house, and
recommended changing medications to seroquel, trazodone, and
prozac.  She will follow up with her outpatient psychiatrist.

4. Hyperlipidemia- Lipitor was continued in-house.

5. GERD- Continue protonix, especially while on steroids.

6. Disposition:She was discharged back to her group home and
will follow up with her PCP and psychiatrist.
