IMAGING:
[**3-3**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Left tentorial subdural hematoma
measuring 6-7 mm, comparable to the reported measurement of 6 mm
at an outside hospital CT. Direct comparison was not made given
absence of prior study availability at the time of this
dictation.
.
[**3-3**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
1. Unchanged density and size of the left paratentorial subdural
hematoma.
2. No new sites of intracranial hemorrhage, no acute infarction
or mass
effect.
.
[**3-5**] CXR:
Patient has had median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement
either aortic or mitral. Transvenous pacer lead projects over
the floor of the right ventricle. Moderate cardiomegaly is
global. Elevation of the right lung base could be due to an
elevated diaphragm or subpulmonic pleural effusion.
Opacification in the infrahilar right lung is probably
atelectasis.  Generalized pulmonary vascular congestion suggests
elevated left atrial pressure but there is no definite pulmonary
edema. Pleural effusion, if any, is small, on the right. No
pneumothorax.
.
[**3-5**] CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast:
1. No retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal bleed is noted.
2. Status post aortobiiliac grafting.
3. 19 mm calcified right renal artery aneurysm.
4. Moderate cardiomegaly with enlargement of the right atrium
and IVC.
5. Hiatal hernia.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Subdural hematoma:  86 y/o F on coumadin for Afib presents s/p
fall after taking ambien to help her sleep. She presented to OSH
with occiput head laceration. Head CT showed L SDH. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further neurosurgical workup. Patient
denied any nause, vomiting, diziness, or loss of consciousness.
Staples were placed over her lacerations and repeat head CT upon
arrival to ED was stable, INR was reversed with FFP and vitamin
K. She was admitted to neurosurgery for observation.  She is
scheduled to follow-up with neurosurgery and will have a repeat
CT scan at that time.
.
#  Acute anemia: On hospital day 3, routine labs revealed that
hct had dropped to 18.  Unclear bleeding source. SDH would not
accomodate this degree of blood loss.  Iron studies consistent
with iron deficiency anemia (suggestive of blood loss anemia).
She remained hemodynamically stable. EGD was negative. Had
colonoscopy within the past 2 years that was negative. Hct
bumped appropriately to 3 units of RBC and remained stable
afterwards. Source of anemia was felt to be either lower GI loss
vs secondary to extensive bleeding from her head after the fall.
CT abd/pelvis was negative for RP bleed.  Labs were not
consistent with hemolysis.  Could consider colonoscopy to
complete GI work-up as an outpatient. Hct 31 on day of
discharge.
.
#  Chest pressure/Troponin rise:  On the day after her hct drop
the patient developed chest pressure at rest.  Difficult to
interpret ECG as she is paced.  Trop peaked at 0.09 with flat
CK.  This was felt to represent demand ischemia in the setting
of severe anemia.  She was re-started on aspirin when her hct
stabilized.  Also continued her beta blocker.
.
#  Urinary tract infection:  Pt developed a symptomatic UTI with
increased urinary frequency.  She was treated with cefpodoxime
to complete a 7 day course.
.
#  Chronic Systolic CHF: Per primary cardiologist, last echo in
[**2130**] with EF 40%. Pt was initially a bit volume overloaded when
she was transferred to the medicine service.  Improved with
diuresis and being put back on her home dose of lasix.  She was
maintained on supplemental O2 at 2L.  She was started on an ACEI
and continued on beta blocker.  Unclear why she was not on an
ACEI as an outpatient.
.
#  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Patient without prior stroke, however
with heart failure, hypertension and advanced age.  Aspirin anc
coumadin were held initially and INR was reversed.  After anemia
stabilized, she was re-started on daily baby aspirin.  Coumadin
should be held until repeat CT scan demonstrates that SDH is
stable.  She was continued on m
