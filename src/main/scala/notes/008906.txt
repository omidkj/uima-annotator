female who is complaining of shortness of breath with
exertion and increasing dizziness with exertion.  On [**2-20**],
the patient was treated for a pneumonia and congestive heart
failure.  She has had an ejection fraction of 30% on
echocardiogram with left ventricular hypertrophy.  CT scan
shows interstitial fibrosis and BOOP.  In [**8-23**], the patient
had a cerebrovascular accident.

Cardiac catheterization was done  on [**2-21**] showing 100% right
femoral profunda, ejection fraction 70%, LVEDP 12, left axis
deviation 40% diagonal, 40% right coronary artery, 50% severe
AS with [**Location (un) 109**].  Cardiac echocardiogram shows severe AS, MAC,
mild MR, moderate TR.

accident, no transient ischemic attacks, positive coma 30
years ago, result in after which the patient continued to
have an unusual speech pattern.  Heme/Endocrine/other:  No

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 76, blood pressure 139/63.
In general, the patient is frail, but well-nourished.  Skin:
Multiple small ecchymosis, no rash, good skin tone.  HEENT:
Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Normal buccal
mucosa.  Neck:  No jugular venous distention.  Murmur
radiated to both sides of her neck.  Chest:  Bibasilar
crackles, otherwise clear, slightly kyphotic.  Heart:
Regular, rate, and rhythm, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur
radiates throughout the precordium and neck.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly,
well-healed suprapubic scar.  Extremities are warm and well
perfused.  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Varicosities,
small spider veins, bilateral lower extremities, no
varicosities.  Neurologic is grossly nonfocal.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are grossly intact.  Excellent strength
in all four extremities.  Pulses:  Bilateral femoral 2+,
bilateral DP and PT pulses 1+, radial bilateral 2+.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2118-3-29**] and
taken to the operating room where an aortic valve replacement
was performed for symptomatic aortic stenosis.
Postoperatively, the patient left operating room on a
propofol and Neo-Synephrine drip.  She had chest tubes and
pacing wires in place.

Patient received perioperative Vancomycin treatment.  Patient
did well postoperatively.  Was immediately tried on regular
food.  She was extubated in a timely fashion.  Her drips were
stopped on a timely fashion.  The patient was noted to have a
left bundle branch block, prolonged P-R intervals.  She was
seen by the Electrophysiology Department, who believed that
her conduction recovery would likely be predictably low, and
therefore recommended a permanent DDD pacemaker which was
placed on postoperative day one.

Patient was started on an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker,
Plavix as her carotid disease and history of cerebrovascular
accident was restarted at the appropriate time.  The patient
was seen by Physical Therapy worked with her extensively, and
believes the patient will do well with some kind of
rehabilitation facility.

The patient was stable.  The patient was transferred to the
regular surgical floor, where she did well.  She did have
bilateral crackles, and interval chest x-rays confirmed
improvement of her lung status.  Lasix was given to increase
the patient's urinary output and decrease her volume
overload.

Patient failed her voiding trial, had to be recatheterized
for 24 hours.  Patient is being seen by Cardiology to
readjust her pacemaker to a lower heart rate.

On [**2118-4-4**], the patient was doing well and will be
discharged today to a rehabilitation facility in good
condition.  The patient should not drive while on pain
medication.  She may take showers, but she may not take
bathes.  She should avoid strenuous activity.

approximately one week.
