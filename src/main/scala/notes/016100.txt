Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath
Lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
63 y/o male with EtOH abuse, HTN, HLD, and possible remote
history of MI admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**6-4**] with new onset
congestive heart failure. Patient reports that 2 months ago he
developed a chest cold with congestion while working as a school
crossing guard. He felt better after several weeks and then
noticed that his lower extremities began to swell and he
devloped progressive dyspnea on exeration, stating that before
becoming ill, he could walk up 7-8 flights of stairs but this
gradually worsened to only being able to walk up 4 flights of
stairs in approximately 20 minutes, as he has to stop and take
breaks. Throughout this time he denied chest pain, palpitations.
He denied orthopnea and PND but did report gradual development
of a right upper quadrant abdominal pain that coincided with his
leg swelling.
.
He finally presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-4**] as he was dyspnic at rest.
He was found to have pulmonary edema by CXR with a possible
right base consolidation. A TTE revealed severe biventricular
hypokinesis and a small circumferential pericardial effusion. He
was started on Lisinopril, Aspirin, and Lasix 20 mg IV Q6H with
[**Location 98730**]2L. Patietn was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] for further
management.
.
Currently, the patient is comfortable at rest. He states that
his abdominal pain has significantly improved. He also states
that his lower extremity edema is improving and that he is able
to move his legs better than on admission.

.
Echocardiogram ([**2110-6-5**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. IMPRESSION: Dilated left
ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction. Moderately
dilated right ventricle with moderate global systolic
dysfunction. Mild functional mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
.
CXR ([**2110-6-4**]): Large opacity projecting over the right
hemithorax, may represent combination of consolidation,
atelectasis, and possible underlying pleural effusion, worrisome
for infection, however, underlying malignancy is not excluded,
and followup to resolution is recommended.
.
CXR ([**2110-6-4**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
increasing
atelectasis at the left lung base. The presence of a minimal
left pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. The pre-existing extensive
opacities at the
right lung base, likely to be accompanied by a right pleural
effusion, are
constant.
.
Relevant EKGs:
1. [**2110-6-4**]: Probable sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Left axis deviation. Left bundle-branch block. Left atrial
enlargement. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2109-4-13**] left
bundle-branch block and left atrial enlargement are seen on the
current tracing. The rate is increased.
2. [**2110-6-5**]: Sinus tachycardia with ventricular premature beats.
Left bundle-branch block. T waves are prominent, although this
may be due to the left bundle-branch block. Cannot exclude
hyperkalemia or myocardial ischemia as the cause.
3. [**2110-6-11**]: Sinus rhythm with atrial premature depolarizations.
Left atrial abnormality. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy
with incomplete left bundle-branch block. Diffuse non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities.
.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**2110-6-11**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LM,
LAD, LCx
and RCA were free of angiographically apparent disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left sided
