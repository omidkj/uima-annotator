Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year-old female with a history of coronary artery
disease s/p CABG in [**2152**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to diagonal, SVG to
OM-2, SVG to PDA), s/p AAA repair, right femoral bypass,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] with worsening shortness
of breath. At [**Hospital3 3583**], she had a work up including
echocardiogram, labs and chest x-ray.  At OSH, patient developed
leukocytosis, diarrhea, abdominal pain and treated empirically
with po vancomycin for presumed C Diff.

Patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for flutter ablation, but was
deemed to be a poor candidate.  While inpatient, she has had
increased oxygen requirement of likely multifactorial etiology.
Patient was started on a lasix gtt and was not tolerating
diuresis because of drops in SBPs.  Additionally, she had
abdominal discomfort of unclear etiology.  Patient has had a CT
Abdoment that shows chronic [**Female First Name (un) 899**] blockage, but no evidence of
bowel ischemia.

On floor, patient triggered for low oxygen saturation and at
time of transfer was on 6L 02 with sats in mid 90s.

diagonal, SVG to OM-2, SVG to PDA
-- Severe PVD
-- H/O GI bleeding
-- H/O AAA
-- Cataracts
-- left hemidiaphramgatic paresis
-- Chronic renal insuficiency

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use, prior smoker for many years. There is no history of alcohol
abuse.

Family History:
There is a paternal history of coronary artery
disease/peripheral artery disease, died at age 77.

Physical Exam:

CXR [**10-14**]: Moderate left pleural effusion unchanged since
[**10-8**], while small right pleural effusion has increased
since [**10-13**]. Opacification at the base of the left lung is
attributable to atelectasis, but on the right, there could be
pneumonia. Borderline interstitial pulmonary edema is still
present.  Severe cardiomegaly is longstanding. Right
supraclavicular central venous line ends at the superior
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.

CTA Abd [**10-9**]:
1. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the
aorta, iliac
arteries and major branches.
2. Coronary calcifications.
3. Evidence of anasarca with subcutaneous edema and ascites.
4. Ground-glass patchy and emphysematous change in lung bases,
bilateral
pleural effusion and atelectasis, more prominent on the left
side.
5. Stranding surrounding the left kidney with a small focal
perinephric
subcapsular fluid collection.
6. No evidence of bowel ischemia. There is no evidence of
pneumatosis or
bowel wall thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 76 yo female with CAD, s/p AAA, PVD, CRI, who
initially presented to OSH with CHF exacerbation, transferred
from OSH for a. flutter ablation and course complication by
hypoxia and anasarca.

#. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Pt had worsening hypoxia, thought to be
volume overload (diuresed) with component of COPD, and pneumonia
(treated with Vancomycin and Zosyn).  Diaphragmatic hemiparesis
also likely contributor.  PE unlikely while anticoagulated. Pt
was clear in her wished to avoid intubation and trach and she
was maintained on CPAP until family agreed to make pt [**Name (NI) 3225**]. At
that time she quickly desaturated, was started on Morphine drip
and expired. Time of death was 6:45PM on [**2161-10-14**].

#. CAD: Patient has a history of severe three vessel disease s/p
CABG. Pt was medically managed on ASA. Beta blocker held for
hypotension, and statin held for elevated LFTs.

#. AFlutter: Pt was medically managed on digoxin and amiodarone.
Cardioversion was postponed given other medical issues.
Anticoagulated with argatroban given confirmed history of HIT.

#. Abdominal Pain/Distension/Diarrhea: Patient has a history of
open AAA repair, cholecystectomy and ventral hernia repair
recently. C. Diff negative x3 but completing course of PO Vanc.
CT abdomen shows occluded [**Female First Name (un) 899**] but felt to be chronic as Lactate
wnl.  Vascular surgery followed, and plan was for flex sig once
medically stable. At time of death pt's family expressed
interest in particular attention being paid to pt's GI symptoms
on autopsy.
