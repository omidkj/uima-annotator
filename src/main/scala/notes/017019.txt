Fever, SOB

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male with a history of pancreatic
cancer s/p ressection in [**3-19**] with splenectomy, MDS, CHF and
hypertension who presents with one week of lethargy and one day
of shortness of breath and fever.  The patient has had a number
of recent admissions for pneumonia.  He was most recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] from [**2154-7-12**] to [**2154-7-16**] when he
presented with fevers, bilateral infiltrates and hypoxemia.  At
that time it was thought that he most like had a pneumonia
related to his MDS but he was also thought to have an element of
congestive heart failure and his hypoxemia resolved quickly with
diuresis.  Upon discharge his final diagnosis continued to be
unclear.
.
He was discharged and was feeling significantly better.  He and
his wife took a trip to [**Name (NI) **] this week.  His wife reports that
approximately ten days ago she developed a viral URI with cough
and congestsion and that her husband caught this virus as well.
Their acute symptoms resolved but the patient continued to have
cough.  Starting a week prior to this admission he reports
starting to feel more lethargic although even as late as one day
prior to admission he was able to walk [**4-18**] of a mile without
getting short of breath (although he was fatigued).  He did not
sleep well the night prior to admission but was not SOB.  On the
day of admission he woke up and did not feel particularly
poorly.  At 10 AM he began to feel nauseus and vomited x 1. At
11 AM he began to feel somewhat short of breath and his wife
noticed that he felt warm.  He also noted that his cough was
more productive than previously of clear sputum.  He took his
temperature and found that it was 102 degrees.  He called his
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who advised him to come here.
.
In the ER his vitals were T 100.8, BP 180/64, HR 86, RR 17, O2
85% on RA -> 99% NRB. Lab values were remarkable for a WBC of
54K with 12% bands. BNP was 17K (prior 8K-25K), Hct 23(BL
26-30). CXR and CTA show RLL PNA and mild pulmonary edema.
Guaiac negative. He received 1 gram of ceftriaxone and 500 mg of
azithromycin as well as 40 mg of IV Lasix.  He was admitted to
the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU the patient was found to be breathing
comfortably on NRB without respiratory distress or accessory
muscle use.  He was continued on ceftriaxone and azithromycin
and received one dose of vancomycin.  He received albuterol and
atrovent nebs.  His metoprolol was decreased and his lisinopril
was held given slight elevation in his serum creatinine at 1.1
from baseline 0.6 to 1.0.  His hematocrit was noted to fall from
23.1 to 20.4 and he received one unit PRBCs.   His oxygen slowly
weaned to nasal cannula and he was transferred to the floor.
.
On review of sytems he now denies headache, neck stiffness,
nausea, vomiting, chest pain, says his SOB is much improved,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria,
melena, hematochezia, hematemasis, easy bruising, calf pain or
swelling. He has had worsening lower extremity edema over the
past month but this is actually improved at this time.  He
denies any changes in his diet.

Imaging
CXR PA and Lateral [**2154-8-30**]: MPRESSION: Improving congestive
heart failure and right basilar pneumonia.
.
Portable CXR [**2155-8-25**]:
Consolidation in the right lower lobe has progressed since
[**8-23**] consistent with worsening pneumonia.  Mild pulmonary
edema and mild
cardiomegaly stable.  No appreciable pleural effusion.  No
pneumothorax.
.
PA and Lateral CXR [**2154-8-23**]:
1. New airspace process in the left lower lobe, posteriorly; in
this clinical setting, early pneumonic consolidation is a
consideration.
2. Significant improvement in findings of CHF since the [**2-20**]
study, with residual interstitial edema and no significant
effusion.
.
CTA [**2154-8-23**]:
1. right lower lobe pneumonia
2. mild pulmonary edema
3. pathologic mediastinal adenopathy, unchanged
.
EKG [**2154-8-23**]: NSR @ 75. LAD. LAFB. LVH. Early RW progression.
Nonspecific ST-TW changes. Unchanged from prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 75M w/hx of pancreatic CA s/p resection and splenectomy,
MDS, CHF, and htn presents with fever, productive cough and SOB.
 Physical exam significant for decr breath sounds on R, crackles
(R>L), and dullness at right base.  CT/CXR showed evidence of
RLL consolidation.  In this clinical setting, most likely
diagnosis is a community-acquired pneumonia.
