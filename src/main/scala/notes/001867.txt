History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 53 y/o with a hx of Type II DM, CAD s/p CABG x 3 and
multiple stenting procedures, obesity, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia who is transferred for further management of a L
cerebellar infarct.

Pt. reports that she was in her USOH until Thursday [**2-2**], when
she noticed that her speech was slurred.  Then early in the
morning on Friday ([**2-3**]) around 4 AM she got up off the couch and
fell to the floor due to imbalance.  She did not notice any
weakness or numbness at that time.  She reports she vomited once
and felt very nauseated.  She stayed on the floor because she
felt too off balance to stand, and eventually around 6AM her
husband found her and helped her back to bed.  She slept for a
few hours, and then tried to get up to go to the bathroom with
the aid of a walker, but fell again.  At this point he called
EMS and she was transferred to [**Hospital3 **].

At [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 46**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 430**] CT was performed, and was read as 3 cm density
in the L cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema, shift of
the 4th ventricle on the R, and partial effacement of hte
paramesencephalic cistern at the level of the pons on the left.
She was admitted for a metastatic work up for brain mass and
started on Decadron 4 mg Q6 given concern for mass effect.  A CT
Torso was performed and showed several tiny pulmonary nodules on
the right and an adrenal nodule on the left.  CEs were monitored
and were elevated (peaked at 4.33, normal range 0.0-0.04, on [**2-3**]
at 2100, then trended down) and she was seen by Cardiology, who
recommended medical management.  She was seen by Neurosurgery
there on [**2-5**], and their exam was significant for intact
strength and normal cranial nerve exam and L sided dysmetria.
They recommended MRI head for further work up.  MRI was
performed today (delayed [**1-27**] pt. claustrophobia, required open
MRI at Shields), and was read as a 3 cm area of restricted
diffusion in the L cerebellum with mass effect on the 4th and
medulla, more c/w acute to subacute infarct.  Decadron was
d/ced.  She was seen by Neurology there this morning, and they
reviewed her MRI.

Their exam was similar to Neurosurgery's exam, and showed intact
strength and cranial nerves and L sided dysmetria.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given concern for mass effect on the
brainstem.

Symptomatically she reports that she has continued to feel
nauseated but has not thrown up since Friday.  Today, around the
time she was examined by Neurology, she noticed some
intermittent vertical diplopia (although she did not have
diplopia on their exam).  She denies any numbness or weakness.
She feels very clumsy on her left side and has been unable to
walk without assistance.  She feels that her speech is still
slurred, but denies any problems with word finding or
comprehension.  No dysphagia.  No change in bowel or bladder
movements.  She has had a pounding bitemporal headache on and
off since Friday (has one now) which is similar to her normal
migraine headaches.

Past Medical History:
CAD, s/p CABG x 3, mult caths and stenting procedures, many
angina admissions, EF >=60% on echo from [**2-27**]; most recent
stenting in [**12/2146**]

Pertinent Results:
OSH labs from [**2-15**]:
WBC 12.7 Hct 39.1 Plt 162 Hgb 12.9 Na 134 K 4.7 Cl 99 HCO3 23
BUN 26 Cr 0.9 Glucose 317

Imaging:
Head CT from OSH:
- new 3 cm area of density within the left cerebellar hemisphere
with surrounding edema with mass effect and shift of the 4th
ventricle to hte R of midline and partial effaceemtn of the
paramesencephalic cisterns at the level of the pons
- 3rd and lateral ventricles symmetric and not enlarged

MRI from OSH (per Neurology consult note):
- 3 cm area of restricted diffusion in the L cerebellum with
mass effect on the 4th and medulla, more c/w acute to subacute
infarct (no report available)

Head CT noncontrast [**2147-2-7**]: A large area of hypodensity
centered in the right cerebellum measuring approximately 47 x 46
mm, with a laterally centered region of higher density measuring
28 x 32 mm is seen, probably representing the known left
cerebellar infarct.  This infarct has mass effect on the
midbrain and superior medulla, with compression of the fourth
ventricle rightward.  The vermis is displaced rightward,
approximately 7 mm.  The cerebellopontine angle cistern and
superior medullary cisterns are effaced.
The lateral ventricles are more prominent than they were in the
[**2145-3-18**] CT scan, concerning for noncommunicating
hydrocephalus.  There is no evidence of transependymal edema.
Hypodensities in both corona radiata, especially surrounding the
frontal lobes and in the subinsular white matter on the left
indicate chronic microvascular changes. Imaged sinuses are
clear.  No fractures are s
