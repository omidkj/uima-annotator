Allergies:
Talwin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
failure to thrive, as per patient "ultrasensitive to taste,
other senses"


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year-old woman with IDDM, COPD, interstitial lung
disease, h/o IVDU on methadone maintenance, hepatitis C, gastric
varices, depression, anxiety with recent 40 lb weight loss in
setting of dysphagia with thus far unremarkable work up, also
with falls, incontinence and hypersensitivity to all 5 senses.
.
When asked, the patient's chief concern is a feeling of
hypersensitivity to smells, tastes, touch.  She says she can
taste what individuals with home she talks have eaten, she can
feel the alarm sounds from rooms away, she can smell things from
down the [**Doctor Last Name **].  She reports feeling as though specks are coming
from me as I talk to her and entering her eyes and mouth.  She
denies auditory or visual hallucinations but rather reports a
hyperawareness of her senses.  Denies depressive symtpoms
including anhedonia, sleep or appetite changes.
.
She says her weight loss is due to her food getting stuck in her
throat around her voice box.  Good appetite.  No abdominal pain,
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or constipation.
.
Also reports urinary incontinence and gait instability.  Denies
weakness or sensory deficits but rather says she just sometimes
falls without understanding why.  Of note, she reported to
emergency room providers that she had wet herself when in fact
she had dry diaper.
.
Work up for weight loss and dysphagia thus far have included
recent EGD which demonstrated gastritis and Barrett's esophagus,
CT abdomen which demonstrated an isolated pulmonary nodule,
gastric varices and a renal cyst. Follow up renal ultrasound
confirmed large cyst.  Additionally, barium swallow done in
early [**Month (only) 404**] demonstrated only hiatal hernia.  CT chest also
performed and confirmed isolated pulmonary nodule.  Because of
the patient's recent gait instability, MR head to assess for
mass or multiple sclerosis performed a few days ago demonstrated
likely chronic vascular occlusions.  Recent labs remarkable for
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia(chronic), recent hypernatremia
now resolved, hypokalemia and albumin of 4.
.
New medications over this period appear to be citalopram,
reglan, prilosec and urecholine, but would need to confirm with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as patient unsure.

.
CT neck: 1. No overt masses in the neck, causing luminal
narrowing of the [**Last Name (un) **]-, oro-, or hypopharynx, to explain the
patient's symptoms. Consider barium swallow, based on clinical
symptoms (dysphagia).
2. Please see the report of the CT scan of the chest, done on
[**2115-5-15**] for further details concerning the lungs.

.
Bone scan: Nonspecific focus of increased activity at the
costovertebral
junction of the left 10th rib.
.
Video swallow: Delayed pharyngeal swallow initiation, and slow
oral bolus transit time. Trace penetration with thin liquids
only. No aspiration.
.
MR C spine: Mild changes of cervical spondylosis from C4-5 to
C6-7. No evidence of spinal stenosis. Mild foraminal narrowing
at C5-6 level. No evidence of extrinsic spinal cord compression
or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities.
.
pCXR: Allowing for rotation, cardiac and mediastinal contours
are stable in appearance with prominence of the right cardiac
border without change from older studies. Slight upper zone
vascular redistribution and vascular indistinctness suggest
early fluid overload, and there is a questionable small right
pleural effusion.
.
CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Evidence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension, varices, and
ascites.
2. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
3. Moderately distended rectum containing stool and retained
contrast from earlier studies, with mild wall thickening, which
may be inflammatory or due to venous congestion. Correlation
with physical examination is suggested.
.
Head CT: Normal study, including no sign of intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Weight Loss:  Extensive work up thus far has included MRI
head, CT chest/abdomen, EGD, barium swallow within past six
months, labs including cbc, chem-10, b12, rpr, tsh, free t4,
spep/upep, hepatitis panel. To summarize, patient has Barrett's
esophagus, gastritis, gastric varices, isolated pulmonary
nodule, treated hypothyroidism and diabetes, hepatitis C.
--[**Last Name (un) **]/[**Last Name (un) 3907**] as outpatient
--follow up with outpatient psychiatrist as dysphagi may have
functional component as patient seems severely limited by her
numeroud delusions.
.
2)Hypersensitivity to senses: No clinical evidence of seizures.
Patient declined EEG. Seen by psychiatry and started on
risperdal 1 mg hs for delusions. Will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], her psychiatrist.
.
3) UTI with possible sepsis: Had brief episode of hypotension
and was discovered to have a UTI with MSSA. She will complete a
14 day course of dicloxacillin.

3)Neuro: Incontinence/gait instability/neuropathy history: No
clear evidence of actual incontinence, this appears to be a
