Service:  [**Hospital1 **] MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This 70 year old woman is
transferred from the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the Floor
after originally being transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital with acute renal failure and
hypotension.  She has a history of cirrhosis secondary to
NASH and has recently been treated for left lower extremity
cellulitis.  She was admitted to [**Last Name (un) 4199**] on [**3-16**],
originally presenting for a twisted ankle, but found to have
a creatinine of 5.7.  After dialysis she had a systolic blood
pressure in the 90s and was started on a Dopamine drip.  She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] later
that day.

Here, she has required multiple dialysis sessions for volume
overload as well as vasopressors (initially Dopamine changed
to Norepinephrine for tachycardia) to maintain her blood
pressure.  She has grown coagulase negative Staphylococcus
from two blood culture bottles.  Her urine was negative for
Eosinophils and had muddy casts.  Her initial FENA was less
than 0.4%.  She has also had elevated troponin with peak
14.7, and an echocardiogram revealing no wall motion
abnormalities.  Overall, her clinical picture has been
considered to be most consistent with hypotension secondary
to intravascular volume depletion resulting in decreased
renal perfusion, prerenal azotemia, and acute tubular
necrosis.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient, as stated above, had
acute renal failure likely secondary to acute tubular
necrosis.  By the time she was transferred to the Floor, she
was producing a good amount of urine.  Her creatinine
continued to trend downward and returned to her baseline
level of 1.2 prior to discharge.
2.  EXTRAVASCULAR VOLUME OVERLOAD WITH PERIPHERAL AND
INTERSTITIAL PULMONARY EDEMA:  These problems likely had
multiple contributing factors, including the patient's renal
failure and her hypoalbuminemia secondary to liver failure.
Initially, after arrival to the floor, the patient
auto-diuresed without the aid of supplemental diuretics.
Prior to discharge, the patient was placed back on a Lasix
regimen and produced good urine in response.  Her discharge
dose of Lasix was 80 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  As
aforementioned the patient had evidence of myocardial
infarction based on cardiac enzymes when she was in the
Intensive Care Unit.  This infarction was attributed to
increased myocardial oxygen demand as opposed to a discrete
coronary artery lesion.  The patient was continued on
aspirin.  She did not complain of any chest pain throughout
her admission.
4.  LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY CELLULITIS, MSSE BACTEREMIA:  The
patient was continued on antibiotics for these problems.  She
received a total of a 14 day course of Metronidazole and
Vancomycin.  By the time of discharge, her cellulitis
appeared to be improving.  She was afebrile throughout her
time on the floor.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post acute renal failure secondary to acute
tubular necrosis.
2.  Status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
3.  Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
4.  Chronic liver failure secondary to nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis and complicated by hypoalbuminemia,
esophageal varices, anasarca, history of hepatic
encephalopathy.
5.  Obesity.
6.  Chronic macrocytic anemia, likely secondary to liver
failure.
7.  Chronic thrombocytopenia secondary to splenic
sequestration.
8.  Recurrent cellulitis.
9.  Coronary artery disease.
10. Dyslipidemia.
11. Type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin.
12. Hypothyroidism.
13. Asthma.
14. History of migraine headaches.
15. Fibromyalgia.
16. Glaucoma.
17. Cataracts.
