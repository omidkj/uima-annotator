HPI:
53yo man with history of ETOH abuse and h/o withdrawal seizures

was initially transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**].

He had presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with fever, diarrhea, and RUQ
pain. There, he had undergone a RUQ US which reportedly
demonstrated gallstones, and he was treated for cholangitis with
Unasyn 3g IV q6h. His labs there were significant for Tbili of
2.09 (direct 0.82), Alk phos of 161, ALT of 90, AST of 92, and
WBC of 9.0 with 83% PMNs. He was also in the midst of being
treated with Valium (5mg po q12h) for "tremulousness" there. At
ERCP, he was initially reported to be alert and oriented. He
received ampicillin 2gm IV and gentamycin 80mg once IV in
preparation for the procedure. Then, he received fentanyl 75mcg,
Versed 3mg, Phenergan, and Ativan 1mg and became acutely
agitated. A code purple was called, and he was evaluated by
psychiatry. At that time, he was agitated and suspected to be
having visual and auditory hallucinations.
During this episode, he was given 10mg of Haloperidol IV with
Cogentin 1mg IV. He additionally received 4-6mg of Ativan IV and

was placed in 4 pt mechanical restraints. He ultimately became
more calm and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further
evaluation. Vitals during this event were the following:
P 80-90, BP 150/70, sat 100% on RA, and FS of 200's.
.
His ED course was significant for 1:1 sitter, CIWA
monitoring, and escalating dosing of valium up to q1hr valium
20mg for signs and symptoms of etoh withdrawal. Initial vitals
in the ED were T 102, P 105, 160/103, 98% on 2L nc. He was
described as agitated, mumbling, and warm to the touch. Through
his ED course, he was hypertensive and tachycardic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan:
53yo man with h/o etoh abuse and withdrawal now presenting with
signs of etoh withdrawal in setting of anticipated ERCP.
.
1. ETOH withdrawal: On admission, there was concern for ETOH
withdrawal, as evidenced by his tremulousness, tachycardia,
agitation. Per his account, the patient was about three days out
from his last drink, which put him in the range of delirium
tremens. This was supported by his delirium and autonomic
instability.  He was monitored closely per CIWA scale and
provided prn valium for signs/symptoms of withdrawal; he also
received Haldol prn. He denied any other substance abuse, and
his urine and serum tox screen were only otherwise significant
for benzodiazepines (as he was given valium at [**Location (un) 620**] prior to
transfer).  He also had a 1:1 sitter due to agitation and flight
risk.  The patient was evaluated and followed by psychiatry, who
ultimately felt he was stable for discharge.  He also met with
the social worker, who discussed his alcohol dependence with him
and provided him with information about sobriety resources.
.
2. Fever, RUQ pain, cholestasis:  Initially, there was concern
for cholangitis, however, there was no evidence of CBD
dilatation.  The patient was treated with unasyn to cover
biliary pathogens, but this was discontinued when the patient
remained afebrile and pain-free.  He was seen and evaluated by
the GI and ERCP services, who felt there was no acute need for
ERCP.  He is to have an elective cholecystectomy in the near
future.  He is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5057**].
.
3. Insulin requiring DM 2 (may be type 1): Initial labs were
significant for hyperglycemia, ketones in urine, and elevated
anion gap; unclear given h/o DKA.  On arrival in the ICU, his
anion gap had already closed after his ED course, in spite of no
specific treatment.  The patien reported that his home dose of
lantus is 40U daily; he was initially placed on half-dose of
lantus in setting of light PO intake and was covered with
sliding scale insulin.  His blood sugars were labile at first,
and he briefly required an insulin drip when sugars were >600.
His lantus was then titrated up with resulting better control.
[**Doctor First Name **] diet was resumed once it was determined that there was no
need for any procedures.
.
4. Hyperlipidemia: Statin was held initially while evaluating
LFT abnormalities; however, it was suspected that this was
primarily a cholestatic picture not likely related to statin
therapy.
.
5. Anemia: The patient had a mildly hyperchromic and macrocytic
anemia; likely secondary to long-standing alcohol abuse.  Iron
studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Stool
was guaiac negative.
