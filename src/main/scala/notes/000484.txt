HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 18719**] is an 89-year-old,
Russian-speaking woman with known CAD (coronary artery
disease) who presented to an outside hospital emergency room
on [**10-19**] with congestive heart failure and
hypertension.  She had elevated cardiac enzymes and troponins
at that,  along with ST elevations by EKG ruled in for non-
STEMI and was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization. Catheterization done at
[**Hospital1 **] MC showed three-vessel coronary artery disease and
cardiothoracic surgery was consulted for possible CABG
(coronary artery bypass graft).  As stated, the
catheterization showed three-vessel disease, including 95
percent left main, 95 percent RCA (right coronary artery), 80
percent circumflex and 99 percent distal LAD (left anterior
descending) with an EF (ejection fraction) of 40 percent.

The patient's past medical history is significant for CAD,
CHF (congestive heart failure), hypertension, osteoarthritis,
BPV (benign positional vertigo) breast CA (carcinoma) status
post lumpectomy.

The patient has no known drug allergies.

Her meds at home include nifedipine XL 90 q.day, Lipitor 40
q.day, Paxil 20 q.day, atenolol 25 q.day, Celebrex 200 q.day,
meclizine 12.5 q.day, Imdur 120 in the a.m., 60 in the p.m.,
and Buspirone 10 b.i.d.

The patient was seen by cardiac surgery and accepted for
coronary artery bypass grafting.  She was followed by the
medicine service and on [**9-24**] was brought to the
operating room.  Please see the OR report for full details
and summary. She had a CABG x4 with the LIMA (left internal
mammary artery) to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the
LAD (left anterior descending), saphenous vein graft to OM
(obtuse marginal) and saphenous vein graft to the PDA
(posterior descending artery). Her bypass time was 71 minutes
with a crossclamp time of 59 minutes.  She tolerated the
operation well was transferred from the operating to the
cardiothoracic intensive care unit.  At the time of transfer,
the patient was A paced at 88 beats per minute with a mean
arterial pressure of 71 and a CVP of 11.  She had Neo-
Synephrine 0.5 mics/ kilogram/minute and propofol at 25
mics/kilogram/minute.  The patient did well in the immediate
postoperative period.  Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was
weaned from the ventilator and successfully extubated on
postoperative day 1. The patient continued to do well and it
was felt that she was ready to transfer to the floor, but,
given her age, it was decided that she would be transferred
instead to a medical intensive care unit for close monitoring
of her hemodynamic status.

On postoperative day 2, the patient was transferred back to
the cardiac surgery recovery unit, due to rapid atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular response rate of 120 to 140.
At that point, she was begun on an amiodarone drip and
received IV beta blockade, following which the patient
converted back to normal sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day 3, the patient developed a fever of 102.
Blood, as well as urine cultures, were sent and the patient
was started on oral levofloxacin. Chest  x-ray was also done
at that time that showed no infiltrates and the patient
stayed in the ICU at that point for close pulmonary
monitoring. The following day, all cultures returned negative
and patient's antibiotics were discontinued.  She remained in
the ICU for vigorous pulmonary toilet, given her relative
hypoxia.  By postoperative day 5, the patient's chest x-ray
had shown improving lung fields and diaphragmatic excursion,
and, at that time, she was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days, the patient showed slow progress
in her activity level.  She had no further of bouts of atrial
fibrillation and, on postoperative day 9, it was decided that
the following day the patient would be stable and ready to be
discharged to rehabilitation.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is
as follows.  Temperature 97.9, heart rate 59 sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 139/64, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 96 percent
on 3 liters. Weight preoperatively 69 kg, at discharge 66.6
kg.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 144, potassium 3.9, chloride 105,
CO2 31, BUN 32, creatinine 0.9, glucose 109, PT 14, PTT 31,
INR 1.3, white count 10, hematocrit 36.4, platelets 366.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  NEURO:  Alert and oriented x3.  Moves all
extremities.  Follows commands.  Nonfocal exam.  PULMONARY:
Breath sounds somewhat diminished in the bases bilaterally.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1,S2.  No murmur.
Sternum is stable.  Incision with staples and dry sterile
dressing, no erythema or drainage.  ABDOMEN: Is soft,
nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well-perfused with no edema, bilateral
leg incision from the saphenous vein harvest sites are clean
and dry with Steri-Strips.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  Include amiodarone 400
mg b.i.d., x7 days, then 400 mg q.day x7 days, then 200 mg
q.day, aspirin 81 mg q.day, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg

b.i.d.
