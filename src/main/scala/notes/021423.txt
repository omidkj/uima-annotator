The patient is a 62 yo F with numerous drug allergies, HTN,
asthma, migraines, fibromyalgia, h/o recurrent diverticulitis
who presents with fever, nausea, vomiting, LLQ pain, dysuria,
and intermittent diarrhea/constipation. She began to have
abdominal pain 4 days prior to admission. She then developed low

(baseline temp 97 per patient). Her abdominal pain began as
suprapubic pain and she endorsed bladder discomfort on urination
but no dysuria. She went to see her gastroenterologist who
referred her to the ED for further evaluation. She had a CT scan
that showed evidence of diverticulitis. She was made NPO and
placed on IVF. She refused antibiotics on the floor given her
history of allergies to multiple antibiotics. She require
antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate acid due to a
possible gastrointestinal microperforation.

MICROBIOLOGIC DATA:

[**2104-2-11**] Blood culture (x 2) - No growth to date
IMAGING STUDIES:

[**2104-2-11**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON - Sigmoid diverticulitis. Focus
of gas along the colon in this region likely represents
diverticulum, although a microperforation is difficult to
exclude, but felt unlikely. No drainable fluid collection.
Gastrogastric fistula again seen in this patient status post
gastric bypass. Hepatic steatosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:

62F with a h/o multiple antibiotic allergies, who presented with
her third epsidode of recurrent diverticulitis with possible
colonic microperforation, now s/p augmentin desensitization and
being transferred back to the medicine floor.

# DIVERTICULITIS - The patient presented with left lower
quadrant pain and low grade fevers, with evidence of
diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon on CT imaging. She required
Augmentin treatment and completed a course following
desensitization noted above. She was maintained NPO above, given
IV fluids and Dilaudid for pain control. Colorectal surgery
followed the patient and agreed with antibiotics and noted she
had no acute surgical needs.  After amoxicillin
desensitization(see below) she was continued on augmentin and
was able to tolerate po.  No fevers or leukocytosis on day of
discharge.  Patient discharged on augmentin to complete a 14 day
course and atarax for prn for rash.  She will follow up with her
pcp..

# AMOXICILLIN DESENSITIZATION - Patient has a history of
multiple allergies to medications with reactions that have
included swelling, pruritis and generalized rash. She presented
with an episode of diverticulitis requiring antibiotic therapy,
and thus she was transferred to the ICU for antibiotic
desensitization. With the assistance of the Allergy specialist,
she was dosed step-wise with Augmentin over several hours with
no allergic response and she tolerated the final dose well. Once
she completed the full dosing she was monitored for 1-hour in
the ICU and transferred back to the Medicine floor. Epinephrine
and steroids were made available but were not required.
.
# ASTHMA - continued on home albuterol and fluticasone inhalers
.
# HYPERTENSION - continue lisinopril on discharge
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA - We continued her home dosing of Zocor 40 mg
PO daily (patient unable to tolerate generic Simvastatin).
