C1 esterase inhibitor, C1 inhibitor and tryptase - pending

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the MICU given concern for airway protection,
treated with Famotidine IV, Solumedrol, and IV Benadryl. He was
ruled out for MI with serial enzymes.

1) Angioedema: Unclear trigger. Patient is on ACE inhibitor and
also started Macrobid recently for presumed UTI (Urine culture
shows < 100k GNRs); however, he had previously tolerated
Macrobid without event.
- Lisinopril and Macrobid discontinued
- Initially admitted to ICU, received Solumedrol IV,
Diphenhydramine IV, Famotidine IV, transitioned to oral
Prednisone, Ranitidine and Benadryl on the floor on hospital day
#2.
- Quickly improved with resolution of tongue swelling, no
difficulty breathing, ambulatory oxygen saturation on room air
on hospital day #3 95-96%
- SPEP displayed no specific abnormalities
- Normal TSH
- Primary care physician should follow up C1 esterase inhibitor,
C1 inhibitor, and Tryptase
.
2) ? UTI: Urine culture from [**5-10**] likely consistent with
contaminant in this patient with chronic foley, given <100K
colonies.
- Macrobid discontinued, patient noted no penile or scrotal pain
- Urine culture from this hospitalization preliminarily was
growing >100K colonies of E. Coli, most likely colonization due
to chronic foley.
- Foley was changed, it appears as if the primary care physician
has plans to discontinue the foley soon
.
3) Asthma:
- Contniued Advair (recently resumed per PCP's note, in the
setting of increased frequency of asthma flares), Singulair 10
mg daily and Albuterol PRN
.
4) Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Patient with chronic foley.
PCP has noted that he will attempt to remove catheter soon.
Doxazosin was continued.
.
5) Coronary Artery Disease: continued ASA, beta-blocker, statin

- Held ACE inhibitor as above
.
6) Diastolic heart failure: Continued blood pressure control and
diuresis with metoprolol, lasix, metolazone.
- Considered the need to uptitrate medications with
discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor, but blood pressure
remained normotensive.
.
7) Type 2 Diabetes:
- Metformin held initially with insulin sliding scale given,
resumed Metformin on hospital day #3
.
8) Depression: Continued Prozac.
.
9) FEN:
- Diuretics per home regimen.
- Cardiac diet.
.
10) Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, H2-blocker per above
