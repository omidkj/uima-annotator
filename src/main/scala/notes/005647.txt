Pertinent Results:
.
ECHO: PRE-CPB:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. Avpacing, then apacing
with prolongued pr interval. Preserved biventricular systolic
function with LVEF = 60%. Trace MR, trivial AI. Aortic contour
is normal post decannulation.  .

Brief Hospital Course:
After catheterization he was referred for surgical evaluation.
He was admitted for pre-op workup and a CXR, carotid duplex, UA
and echocardiogram were conducted as part of the routine pre-op
work-up.  During routine blood work, he was found to be
pancytopenic. He was subsequently found to have a vitamin B12
level of 195, which was believed to be the cause of his
pancytopenia. He was administered B12 injections (1000
micrograms) for one week, and will likely need lifelong oral
therapy thereafter. On [**2173-7-9**], the patient was taken to the OR
where quadruple bypass was performed uneventfully. Please refer
to Dr.[**Name (NI) 10342**] operative report for further details. He weaned
from bypass without pressors, and was transferred to the CVICU
in critical but stable condition. He awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without incident.All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion. He was started on beta
blockers, Statin, Aspirin and diuresed. He continued to progress
and was transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of
strength and mobility.POD#2 he transiently had postoperative
Atrial Fibrillation that was treated with Amiodarone. He
converted to NSR. By the time of discharge on POD#4 Mr.[**Known lastname 87346**]
was ambulating freely, his sternal incision  was healing well
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions advised. Given the patient's persistently low HCT,
the patient was strongly advised to have a colonoscopy upon
discharge.
