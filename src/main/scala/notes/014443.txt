FINAL REPORT


PORTABLE CHEST, 10:12 A.M. ON [**9-5**]

INDICATION: Status post redo CABG and chest tube removal.
Evaluate for
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: Compared with [**2114-9-3**], multiple tubes and catheters
have been
removed. No pneumothorax identified.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.
Prominent Eustachian valve (normal variant).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severe global LV
hypokinesis. Severely depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Eccentric TR jet.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The rhythm appears
to be A-V paced. The patient has runs of a supraventricular
for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

1. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.

2.The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.

3.There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.

4.There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen (restricted anterior leaflet
motion). Vena contracta measures 3mm.

7.The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is being a paced and is on an infusion of
Noepinephrine, Epinephrine and Milrinone

1. Overall LV systolic function is slightly improved.

2. Other findings are unchanged.

3. No flow across the Interatrial septum by color. Bubble study
with valsalva is negative for flow across the interatrial
septum.

4. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**9-2**] for IV heparinization prior to surgery. Patient
had been off his coumadin approx. 5 days prior to admission.EP
performed pacer interrogation prior to OR. Underwent redo cabg
x3/ASD closure/ biventricular lead placement on [**9-3**] with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on
epinephrine, milrinone, and levophed drips. Extubated on POD #1
and weaned off milrinone.Pacer check completed by EP
postop.Epinephrine weaned off. Went into rapid Afib and was
treated with amiodarone on POD #2 and chest tubes also
removed.Off all drips on POD #3 and pacing wires removed.
Re-bolused with amiodarone for Afib again and converted to SR
