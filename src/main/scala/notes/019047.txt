STUDIES:
[**9-8**] CXR:  Findings compatible with congestive heart failure,
right pleural effusion. Limited study.

[**9-9**] Wound tissue path: pending

[**9-9**] XR L foot: There is generalized demineralization with more
prominent focal subchondral bone loss in the region of the fifth
MP and talonavicular joints. No discrete fracture or focal bone
destruction although assessment limited by lack of localizing
history. Generalized soft tissue swelling particularly along the
dorsum of the foot. No discrete soft tissue ulceration.
Appearances are little changed from similar exam [**2177-7-9**].


[**9-12**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-11**], the patient
has taken a
somewhat better inspiration. Continued enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette. Respiratory motion somewhat obscures details
of the pulmonary vessels, bu
