bypass grafting surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details,
please see dictated operative note. She weaned from bypass on
propofol, without the need for pressors.

Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. She maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the floor  on postoperative two.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed according to protocol.
Beta blockers were resumed and diuresis was begun towards
preoperative weight.  physical therapy worked with the patient
for mobilization and strength/endurance.  She desired to go home
from the hospital and arrangements were made for home health
care.

the patient prior to leaving. Out patient followup was also
discussed.
