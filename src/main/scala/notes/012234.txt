Admission Date:  [**2102-9-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2102-10-9**]


Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and congestive heart failure (on 3 liters of home oxygen)
presenting with malaise, shortness of breath, and bilateral
lower extremity edema for several days.

He has had multiple past admissions for cardiopulmonary
problems.  Of note, he has a questionable history of a
pulmonary embolism approximately one year ago and had been on
Coumadin for this in the past.  This had been stopped in
recent months.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; status post two myocardial
infarctions.
2.  Estimated ejection fraction is approximately 15% to 20%.
3.  Status post prostatectomy for prostate cancer.
4.  Atrial arrhythmia, status post pacemaker.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (on 3 liters nasal
cannula at home).
6.  History of pulmonary embolism.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was notable for only
being able to walk approximately 30 feet on admission as
opposed to his baseline of 300 yards approximately two months
ago.  He has difficulty sleeping at night and must sleep at
an angle secondary to his breathing problems.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
glyburide 0.75 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 100 mg p.o. q.d.,
aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.,
Mavik 1 mg p.o. q.d., prednisone 6 mg p.o. q.d.,

albuterol and Atrovent meter-dosed inhaler 2 puffs b.i.d.,
Lipitor 5 mg p.o. q.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.,
Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Advair meter-dosed inhaler 1 puff
b.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., iron 325 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies include CODEINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a past smoker.  No recent
ethanol use.  He is a retired head of the [**Hospital Ward Name **]
security at [**Hospital **] Hospital.

CODE STATUS:  The patient is do not resuscitate/do not
intubate.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 97.9,
heart rate was 76, blood pressure was 142/74, respiratory
rate was 18, saturating 96% on 3 liters nasal cannula.  The
patient was a well-appearing elderly male in no acute
distress.  He was able to speak in full sentences.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed sclerae
were anicteric.  The oropharynx was moist.  Jugular venous
distention went to the angle of the jaw.  Heart was regular
in rate and rhythm with normal first heart sound and second
heart sound.  The lungs had emphysematous breath sounds with
prolonged expiration with occasional anterior wheezing.
There were faint crackles at both bases.  The abdomen was
nontender with the liver edge palpable at 5 cm below the rib
cage.  No appreciable splenomegaly.  Extremities revealed 4+
pitting edema bilaterally to the midthigh.  Neurologic
examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII were
intact with no focal deficits.  The deep tendon reflexes were
1+ and symmetric throughout.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count was 11.7,
hematocrit was 40.4, platelets were 248.  PTT was 28.8, INR
was 1.6.  Digoxin level was 1.2.  The patient's Chemistry-7
revealed sodium was 128, potassium was 5.2, chloride was 92,
bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 77, creatinine
was 2.2, and blood glucose was 153.  Urinalysis on admission
revealed a specific gravity of less than 1.005 with nitrites
negative.  No red blood cells and no white blood cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   A chest x-ray had cardiomegaly and was
consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
changes.  There were no appreciable effusions.

The patient had right lower extremity Doppler studies which
were negative.

A V/Q scan was intermediate probability.

Electrocardiogram with a dual-paced at a rate of 70 with no
appreciable ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 78-year-old male with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
congestive heart failure presenting with malaise, shortness
of breath, and increased lower extremity edema.

On physical examination, the patient had signs of right-sided
heart failure including elevated jugular venous distention
and extremity edema, as well as hepatic congestion.  The
patient was diuresed aggressively; however, on admission the
patient had a creatinine of 2.7 with a baseline of
approximately 1.6.  The patient's creatinine was monitored
during the diuresis.

It was felt, based on the patient's history, there was no
clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so the patient had
initially been started on heparin but this was discontinued
early on in his hospital course.  The patient also had his
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease medications continued.

Regarding the patient's cardiac history, the patient was
diuresed aggressively with intravenous diuresis but was noted
to be refractory to diuresis even with increasing doses of
Lasix and Aldactone.  The Congestive Heart Failure Service
was consulted at this point.

With regard to the patient's diuresis upon transfer to the
C-MED Service, the patient's regimen had added Natrecor to
this regimen in addition to Bumex and Zaroxolyn.  At this
point, the patient tolerated the diuresis.  His systolic
blood pressures remained in the 90s to 100s.

The patient's symptoms improved with decreased edema;
however, the patient still continued to have total volume
body overload.  He still had difficulty with diuresis and was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for more aggressive
monitoring and diuresis.

In the Coronary Care Unit, he was admitted for Swan-Ganz
catheter for further tailored diuresis.  He was transferred
on [**9-29**].  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed with initial
readings with the right ventricle was 60/26, the pulmonary
artery was 60/40, the wedge was 43, cardiac index was 1.6,
cardiac output was 2.6, and systemic vascular resistance
was 1350.

At this point, the patient was started on a Milrinone drip.
The Natrecor was also continued while the patient was in the
Coronary Care Unit.

The patient was transferred back to the floor on [**10-3**]
with some effective diuresis.  The patient's Milrinone was
tapered and was stopped on [**10-8**].  Also, a low-dose ACE
inhibitor was added for afterload reduction.

The patient also was seen by the Electrophysiology Service
during this admission, and the risk and benefits of
electrophysiology study, and left ventricular map, as well as
a biventricular pacemaker were discussed with the patient.
He was reluctant to have groin sticks at this time and said
that he would prefer not to have further treatment.  He had
an episode of ventricular tachycardia which lasted
approximately 30 seconds.  The patient was unresponsive
during the run, but he awoke after the ventricular
tachycardia broke.  The patient denied any further
lightheadedness or dizziness after that.  The patient wished
not to have a implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed
even given his risk for further tachycardic arrhythmic event,
and this was discussed with the Electrophysiology Service.
The patient was aware of the fact that he may have a future
arrhythmic event which may lead to early mortality.  The
patient's amiodarone was continued throughout his whole
hospital admission.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient's fluid balance had
improved, and he was discharged to home with services.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

to 20%.

infarction.
3.  Status post prostatectomy for prostate cancer.
4.  History of atrial arrhythmias; status post pacemaker.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
