This is a partial discharge summary to [**2183-5-18**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 76-year-old male with a
history of MI with systolic dysfunction, EF less than 20%,
hyperlipidemia, AFib, and chronic renal insufficiency, who is
seen in Advanced Heart Failure Clinic and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
nesiritide tailored therapy.  Patient had gone to [**State 108**] for the
winter in decompensated heart failure with recurrent atrial
fibrillation. Despite promising to seek medical care, he had not
sought cardiology followup in [**State 108**], while decompensating
further.  Patient went up 30 pounds in weight in [**State 108**].
Creatinine was found to be worsening.  Patient walks 10 yards and
is short of breath.

Patient was on admission not on an aspirin or beta-blocker.
Complains of moderate-to-low sodium diet.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Amiodarone 200 mg q.d.
2. Folic acid 1 mg q.d.
3. Atorvastatin 10 mg q.d.
4. Coumadin.
5. Furosemide 80 mg q.d.
6. Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
7. Started nesiritide

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CHF:  Systolic EF of less than 20%.
2. Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**2176**].
3. AFib status post on Coumadin.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. Hypothyroid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient dates the owner of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1785**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in
[**Location 1268**].  History of smoking.  No alcohol use recently.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 96.3, blood pressure 90/62, heart
rate 76, respiratory rate 18, and 95% on room air.  Weight
70.6 kg.  Lungs with decreased breath sounds at the right
base half the way up the left base, but not as pronounced,
diffuse crackles.  Irregularly, irregular S1, S2 normal, no
murmur.  Abdomen:  Markedly distended and firm, nontender,
positive bowel sounds, positive fluid wave.  No lower
extremity edema.  Mild non-pitting edema on the left, mild
non-pitting edema on the right.  2+ pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  Creatinine found to be 3.6 on admission,
hematocrit 33.4.  LFTs unremarkable.  TSH greater than 100.

Chest x-ray showed heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CHF:  The patient was markedly decompensated and up
approximately 30 pounds.  Patient was on Natrecor 0.15, Lasix
drip of 7, and dopamine of 3 mcg to maintain pressure and
kidney perfusion.  Patient had a PICC line placed for these
medications.  Patient was still having difficulty diuresing
and his weight was still around 70 kg at this time.

2. Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit had been stable at
approximately around 33.

3. Ascites:  Plans were to do a paracentesis.  The Coumadin
was discontinued and the INR  allowed to drift down.  This
was going slowly so vitamin K 5 mg subq was given.

4. Coronary artery disease:  We continued his aspirin,
atorvastatin.  The beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor were not
started because he was in such decompensated heart failure
and was so hypotensive.

5. Hyperlipidemia:  We increased his Lipitor to 80 mg q.d.

6. Hypothyroid:  TSH was greater than 100 most likely from
amiodarone toxicity.  We restarted the patient on low-dose
levothyroxine at 25 mcg so that as not to cause any ischemia
to the patient.

7. Atrial fibrillation:  We discontinued the amiodarone
because of thyroid dysfunction, the patient not staying in
sinus rhythm.  We discontinued the Coumadin because of the
hopes of paracentesis next week.  Spoke with the attending
and there was no reason to place the patient on Heparin for
anticoagulation.

8. Chronic renal insufficiency:  Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.7
has been slowly decreasing from 3.6-3.0.  It has not gone
back towards baseline.

9. Full code:  I spoke with the patient and his girlfriend,
who wishes to be his healthcare proxy.  They wish all
measures to be performed.

10. Diet:  He was on a 2-gram sodium diet and restricted to 1
liter of fluid per day.  Electrolytes were repleted as
needed.

The rest of this discharge summary will be dictated at the
time of discharge.
