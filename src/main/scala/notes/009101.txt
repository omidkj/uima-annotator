Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness and cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80 yo M with PMH of HTN, congenital deafness and osteoporosis
who presents with fevers, cough and weakness. History is taken
from patient and his home caregiver and also his HCP by phone.
.
Patient was recently admitted after a fall and found to have a
C7 fracture. He was placed in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar and returned to
rehab. Per his caregiver, over the last two days he has become
more weak (not using his walker but requiring a wheelchair to
get around), coughing and sounded "congested."  He has been
noted to have poor PO intake and coughing with all liquids and
foods. His HCP says that he had a speech and swallow in the past
and they recommended crushing his medications in apple sauce and
avoiding thin liquids. The patient has recently refused this and
has been taking thin liquids and coughing signficantly with
them. Today, his caregivers brought him to his PCPs office. They
got a CXR and labs. His sodium returned at 115 and his CXR
suggested aspiration pneumonia with bilateral basilar
infiltrates. He was sent to the ED.
.
In the ED, his vital signs were T 98.6, BP 117/61, HR 103, RR
22, O2sat 96% RA. He had a rectal temp of 102 while in the ED.
His blood pressure transiently dropped to 78/50 and responded to
fluids. He received a total of 1.8L NS. He was also given
levofloxacin and clindamycin for pneumonia. He was admitted to
the ICU for further care.
.
Currently he complains of the mask from the nebulizer and of the
[**Location (un) 2848**] J collar. He is coughing. He denies CP, SOB, n/v, f/c.
Denies constipation or dysuria. He does have trouble with
incontinence. He is congenitally deaf and reads lips.

Studies:
[**2118-12-1**] EKG: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Left axis
deviation. RSR' pattern in  lead VI. Consider inferior wall
myocardial infarction of undetermined age. Since the previous
tracing of [**2118-11-7**] the rate has increased. The R waves in leads
III and aVF are not apparent. The axis is more leftward.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
[**2118-12-1**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Bibasilar patchy opacities compatible
with the history of aspiration.
.
[**2118-12-3**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Possibly worsening.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M with PMH of congential deafness, HTN, osteoporosis who
presents with likely aspiration pneumonia and hyponatremia.

#1 Aspiration Pneumonia / Respiratory Failure: The patient's
clinical presentation, CXR findings, elevated lactate, and
elevated WBC count with bands were consistent with an aspiration
pneumonia.  He received levofloxacin and clindamycin in the ED.
As sputum gram stain showed a mixture of different organisms, he
was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with
vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.  Following his admission to the
ICU the patient continued to be in respiratory distress with
epsidoes of tachypnia and tachycardia with a heart rate to the
150??????s.  An EKG showed MAT.  His respiratory distress was
consistently improved with morphine.  It was felt that Mr.
[**Known lastname 2852**] was unlikely to recover from his pneumonia given his
inability to wean off bipap and to cough to clear his own
secretions.  As he was DNI status he could not be intubated to
have secretions suctioned out.  In addition, the patient
appeared visibly uncomfortable on BiPAP and quickly desaturated
into the 70??????s without it.

Because the patient was given several liters of fluid for
hyponatremia, there was the possibility that diuresis could
improve his oxygenation enough to enable him to wean off the
bipap, however, this did not prove to be the case.  He was also
given nebs prn.  Upon discussing the patient's poor prognosis
with his health care proxy the decision was made to make him
CMO.  Antibiotics and BiPAP were withdrawn and the patient died
shortly thereafter.

#2 Hyponatremia: The patient presented with hyponatremia, likely
hypovolemic hyponatremia.  On admission he appeared dry and had
a history of poor PO intake, although he was mentating well.  He
received 1000 ml NS boluses overnight with maintenance fluids.
The patient does have a history of low sodium but usually to the
130 range, whereas his admission sodium was 115.  His sodium
improving slowly with IVF.

#3 Hypertension: The patient's home regimen of atenolol was held
given concern for possible sepsis in the setting of pneumonia.
Aspirin was continued.

#4 Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Occurred in the setting of
anxiety and tachypnea and improved with morphine.  Rate control
with a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker was held due to
concern for hypotension in the setting of an infection.

#5 spinal fracture: The patient was in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar on
admission.  Per discussion with neurosurgery, the patient needed
to wear the collar due to an unstable spinal fracture.  His
collar was removed when he was made CMO.

#6 BPH with incontinence: The patient's home regimen of
oxybutynin was continued.

#7 Macrocytic anemia: The patient usually has a macrocytic
anemia and presented with a normal hematocrit, indicating that
he was quite volume depleted.  B12 supplementation was
continued.

# Osteoporosis: Calcium, vitamin D, and Fosamax were continued.

# Depression: Escitalopram was continued.
