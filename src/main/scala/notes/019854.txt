Admission Date:  [**2167-3-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-4-3**]


Service:  Cardiac surgery.


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 41531**] is an unfortunate
78 year old gentleman who was admitted to [**Hospital1 41532**] transferred from an outside
hospital, after he sustained an episode of chest pain.

Once in the outside hospital, an electrocardiogram revealed
electrocardiogram changes and he ruled in for a new non Q
wave myocardial infarction by troponin enzymes.  He received
heparin infusion, Plavix and Aggrestatin.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
management.

Once at [**Hospital1 69**], he [**Hospital1 1834**] a
cardiac catheterization that showed a critical LM, 90% left
anterior descending, 80% first diagonal, moderate diseased
circumflex, 90% right coronary artery with a LBEDT of 37 and
an ejection fraction of 20%.  Cardiac surgical service was
consulted for a potential coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of .6 cms.
History of colon cancer; status post colectomy; history of
non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and
hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS: Medications at the time of admission to the
hospital included the following:   Glucophage, Lipitor,
Atenolol, Aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient remained on the CCU service and
he was optimized, as he was found to be a suitable candidate
upon surgical evaluation.  On [**2167-3-31**], Mr. [**Known lastname 41531**] was
taken to the operating room and he [**Known lastname 1834**] a coronary
artery bypass graft times three, including left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending, saphenous
vein graft to the posterior descending artery and saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal.  He also had an AVR repair with a
#19 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.  He tolerated
the procedure well.  He was transferred in stable condition
to the Intensive Care Unit.


Once in the unit, he continued to put more than 200 cc of
bloody drainage through his mediastinal and pleural tubes.
This ongoing bleeding went on for a couple of hours, without
decreasing in volume or amount and the decision was made to
take him back to the operating room for re-exploration. There
was no specific bleeding site identified.

After good hemostasis was confirmed, the patient was
transferred back again to the CSRU for further monitoring.

Overnight, he remained on pressors, requiring epinephrine,
Levophed, Milrinone, Propofol to keep good hemodynamic
parameters.  He was transfused multiple times during the
course of the hospitalization.

By postoperative day two, he remained pressor dependent with
a hematocrit of 43.3 and he was noticed to have a K of 6.0.
His urine output fell and despite receiving simultaneous
doses of Lasix, he had no good renal response.

Over the course of that day, Mr. [**Known lastname 41531**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] several
runs of ventricular tachycardia, requiring multiple
cardioversions. Lidocaine drip was started but, inspite of
all of this, the ventricular tachycardiac runs persisted.

The patient was started on hemodialysis for 50 minutes and
the decision was made to take him back to the catheterization
laboratory to further study him.  Upon the catheterization,
he was found to have a 90% saphenous vein graft to R1
occlusion.  This occlusion was ballooned open.

After this study, the patient returned to the CSRU for
further management and was started on Amudrip and pressors
including epinephrine, Levophed, a Lidocaine drip, Milrinone,
Neo-Synephrine and a bicarbonate drip to control his ongoing
acidosis.

Overnight, he continued to have runs of ventricular
tachycardia, requiring cardioversion, without improvement of
his overall status. Early in the morning of his postoperative
day #3, in an effort to control his renal ischemic acute
tubular necrosis, TVVHD was started.

Despite of all of the above, the patient continued to
deteriorate and his ongoing acidosis worsened.  Finally,
around 4:10 p.m., the patient had an asystolic arrest and
ACLS resuscitation protocol was started.

Despite of chemical, electrical and mechanical stimulation,
the patient didn't respond.  He was noticed to have non
spontaneous breathing. No pulse was palpable.  There were no
audible heart sounds. No gag reflex.  No pupillary or
coronary reflexes were evident.

The patient was pronounced dead by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
4:16 p.m. on [**2167-4-3**].  The family was notified and a post
mortem examination was rejected.  The case was reported
routinely to the medical examiner and he waived the case.

The most likely cause of death was cardiac arrest, secondary
to cardiogenic shock.
