History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with history of recent pneumonia, treated as
outpatient, had acute onset of chest pain and worsening of
dysnea night prior to admission and called 911. Arrived to
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital ED satting 94% on NRB. Was intubated there and
was given levofloxacin. CTA performed with no pulmonary embolism
seen, though did have pulmonary edema +/- infection. Was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED vitals were: T 98, HR 114, BP
204/166, RR 25, O2Sat 100% on AC 550 x 24 with PEEP 10. Blood
pressure precipitously dropped to 45/25 approximately 1 hour
into ED course and patient was given 2 L NS wide open and
started on dobutamine. CVC triple lumen was placed and patient
was given vanc, ceftriaxone, azithromycin. Patient was given
albuterol/ipratropium and solumedrol 125 mg IV. CVP measured
from central line was 15 at end of ED course. Made 400 mL of
urine through ED course. Vitals prior to transfer to the MICU
were: HR 92, BP 103/73, RR 24, O2Sat 100%.
.
Family at the bedisde in MICU unable to provide much additional

IMAGING:

[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital CTA [**2116-4-9**] - [**Hospital1 18**] Radiology Read
FINDINGS: There is marked pulmonary edema in the dependent lungs
with
relatively small bilateral pleural effusions. It has a
consolidative
appearance in the left lower and right upper lobes. There is
underlying
emphysema. The central airways appear patent. There is an
endotracheal tube appropriately positioned within the trachea.
Though incompletely imaged on the images submitted, there is no
evidence of acute aortic syndrome of the thorax. The abdominal
aorta measures at least 3.7cm in the imaged portion.  The heart
is normal in size without pericardial effusion. There are no
pathologically enlarged hilar, mediastinal, or axillary lymph
nodes. The pulmonary arteries are patent to the subsegmental
level. Numerous hypodensities within the liver are not fully
evaluated. The left adrenal is prominent measuring 12 mm. No
concerning osseous lesions are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.

2. Severe pulmonary edema which with left lower and right upper
lobar
consolidation. Likely pneumonia resulting in edema.

3. 3.7 cm suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, incompletely
imaged.

CXR [**4-13**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-12**], there is little
overall
change. Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
Continued pulmonary vascular congestion with layering pleural
effusions. Area of increased opacification in the right mid and
lower zones persists, concerning for pneumonia. Retrocardiac
opacification is consistent with volume loss, though
superimposed pneumonia at the left base can certainly not be
excluded.

CXR [**4-12**]:
Left lung is clear, since resolution of pulmonary edema. Right
mid and lower lung zones are more consolidated today than
yesterday and there may have been an increase in moderate
pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. ET tube and right
jugular line are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube
passes into the stomach and out of view.

Echocardiogram [**2116-4-9**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
35-40%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity with mild to
moderate global systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic and mitral
regurgitation.

EKG [**2116-4-9**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Biatrial abnormality. Left ventricular
hypertrophy. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 58 year old male with PMHx HTN,
Hyperlipidemia who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure
thought to be secondary to severe CAP and a question of
COPD/pulm edema with EF of 35-40%.  Treated with vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin for CAP, prednisone for ?COPD, and
diuresis for pulmonary edema.
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to Community acquired
pneumonia, COPD, and pulmonary edema -  Patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] after intubated at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.  CTA at OSH
showed no PE, multi-focal pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.
Patient was treated with IV antibiotics, initially vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.  He finished a course of
azithromycin but his vancomycin was stopped on transfer to the
floor.  He was to finish an 8 day course of ceftriaxone, with
the last day being cefpodoxime.  He also completed a 5 day burst
with prednisone with albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers to treat
COPD.  He was diuresed while in the ICU.  Was extubated and
tolerated room air without difficulty, was ambulating without
deficit.
.
# Acute systolic heart failure - TTE in ICU showed an ejection
fraction of 35-40%.  The patient was initially diuresed as
above.  On transfer to the floor, he had no evidence of fluid
overload and required no lasix.  He was started on lisinopril
and carvedilol for management of his heart failure.
.
# Hypertension - The patient was initially on verapamil, however
once his EF was known, the patient was switched to lisinopril.
Also on carvedilol as above.
.
Inactive Issues:
.
# Hyperlipidemia - The patient's lipids are moderately high.  A
statin should be considered, however his LFTs are elevated as
below.
.
# Hepati
