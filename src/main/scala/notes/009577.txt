History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is 77 year-old man with history of CAD s/p CABG in
[**2109**](LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM1, RIMA-PRDA, SVG-D1/D2; PCI DES to RCA x2
[**3-/2126**]), CHF (EF 30%), AFib, s/p dual chamber PPM, PVD (s/p
bilateral aorta-iliac bypass grafts, s/p B CEA, left fem-[**Doctor Last Name **],
Left AKA), COPD, Lung CA (cyberknife), CKD (Cr 1.9-2.0), CVA
(x3, last on [**2133-11-9**] priors in '[**28**] and '[**31**])) who presented to
[**Hospital6 33**] from his rehab facility with chest
tightness this past Thursday.   Since he went to rehab after
recent CVA, he has been experiencing intermittent chest pain at
rest (last experienced the night prior to arrival). [**Hospital6 4273**]
diaphoresis or dyspnea. Labs notable for a trop that peaked at
5.22, CK/CK-MG 511/39.9, Cr 2.5, INR 1.4. ECG was 100% AV paced.
Admitted with NSTEMI to [**Hospital3 **].  He was given nitro, ASA
and started on a heparin drip also with metoprolol.  Cardiology
was consulted and evaluated the patient.  He was noted to have
EF of 30-35%, LV dysfunction.  moderate diffuse hypokiness with
moderately severe septal hypokinesia and mild concentric LVH.
He was given IV nitro and heparin.  He ahd recurrent episodes of
CP with EKG changes.  He was initially attempted to manage
medically only, but he remained symptomatic with CP.  He had ARF
with cr elevated to 2.5 range.  He was treated with steroids for
COPD exacerbation and IV abx for question pna.  He had a unit of
pRBC for anemia on [**12-7**], given lasix for CHF.  [**Last Name (un) **], warfarin
was discontinued.  Due to recurrent CP he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for palliative cardiac cath.  He was not given Plavix.
Currently chest pain free. He was give diuresis at [**Hospital3 **].
.
On transferring to [**Hospital1 18**], Cardiac catheterization was deferred
with plan to hydrate overnight and bring back to the cath lab
12.28. Currently, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] chest pain or shortness
of breath. He is laying flat without respiratory distress. He is
hemodynamically stable with HR of 60, BP of 123/71 mmHg, RR
16bpm, SaO2 99% on nasal cannula.  Plan to hydrate overnight
(75cc/hr 1/2NS overnight, recheck creatinine at 7AM and start
75cc/hr NS). NPO after midnight for cardiac cath 12.28.
Continued medical management with restart of Heparin gtt, will
give Plavix load of 300mg now, and start 75mg daily tomorrow.
Continue to hold coumadin. There was a question of pneumonia of
[**Hospital1 34**] and he was receiving CTX/Azithro for this; Repeat CXR will
be done and if there is evidence of  PNA, we will treat with
broad coverage for HAP.
.
On arrival to ccu, he is comfortable with his daughters by his
side.
.
On review of systems, [**Hospital1 **] any prior history deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. [**Hospital1 4273**] recent fevers,
chills or rigors. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
