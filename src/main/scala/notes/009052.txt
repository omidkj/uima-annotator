LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 3.4,
hematocrit 30, platelet count 140.  Differential 54%
neutrophils, 31% lymphocytes, 10% monocytes.  Sodium 129,
potassium 5.4, chloride 94, CO2 20, BUN 15, creatinine 1.1,

No signs of right heart strain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for observation.  She did not
complain of any symptoms of dyspnea at any time during the
admission.  She was started on heparin intravenous while she
was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit and had a IVC filter
placed on [**2115-8-9**].  She was transferred to the floor on
[**2115-8-9**].  She was started on Lovenox 60 mg subQ b.i.d. for
deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis and was intended to
continue Lovenox status post admission, however, owing to the
cost of Lovenox $1000.00 a week and her insurance companies
inability to pay for this she had been started on heparin
instead.  She developed a white blood cell nadir of 430
during the admission, which spontaneously recovered.  This
was felt due to her recent chemotherapy.  She did not develop
a fever or signs of infection at any point during the
admission.

Because she could not receive Lovenox while at home she was
started on Coumadin and was discharge when INR was
therapeutic at 2.4 on [**8-15**].  She received heparin drip up
until the time of discharge.  She was to be seen in her
primary oncologist's office on [**8-19**] for a possible initiation
of cycle number three of chemotherapy pending acceptable
white blood cell count.  Her white blood cell count was 2.5
upon discharge with 28% neutrophils.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is a full code.  Regular
discharge to home.  Condition fair although with poor long
term prognosis owing to ovarian cancer.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Deep venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism.
2.  Ovarian cancer.
