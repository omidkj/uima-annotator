Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2150-11-11**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**2150-11-17**] Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing
the LIMA to LAD, and vein graft to the diagonal artery.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79731**] is a 85 y/o M with history of coronary artery disease
who underwent cardiac catheterization in [**2146**] where he was found
to have a moderate lesion in the proximal LAD and was medically
managed.   He underwent another cardiac catheterization in [**Month (only) 116**]
[**2150**] for worsening chest pain.  He was found to have 60%, 70%
and 80% lesions in the proximal LAD, a 70% lesion in the mid
LAD, and an 80% lesion of the moderatedly sized ostial D3.  In
addition he reportedly had a 30% stenosis of the proximal OM3
and a 40% mid-RCA lesion.   He subsequently underwent stenting
of the  proximal and mid LAD lesions with a 2.5 x 16 m Taxus
stent and overlapping 2.5 mm Taxus stents (24 mm distally and 12
mm more proximally).  His LVEF was not reported but his resting
left heart filling pressures were elevated at 18 mmHg.

On the day prior to this admission, he was seen in cardiology
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] for complaints of chest tightnees.  He
has been going to cardiac rehab, working out three times per
week.  Last Friday he developed chest tightness while on the
treadmill.  It resolved after approximately 5 minutes.  The
following day he had a recurrence which also resolved
spontaneously.  On Sunday he once again had another episode but
at rest watching TV for which he took an ASA and after a period
of time the discomfort subsided. On Monday while shopping, at
the grocery store he had yet another episode for which he took a
nitroglycerin. He was subsequently admitted for repeat cardiac
catheterization.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
 All of the other review of systems were negative. Cardiac
review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2150-11-11**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
extensive single vessel disease. The LMCA was patent.  The LAD
had
severe, diffuse in-stent stenosis (90-95%) in all three stents.
The LCx
had a 30% proximal lesion and a 40% stenosis in a large OM3
branch. The
RCA had a 30% eccentric stenosis in the mid-vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left heart
filling
pressures with an LVEDP of 32mmHg. There was moderate systemic
arterial
hypertension with a central aortic SBP of 160mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated no mitral regurgitation.
The
calculated LVEF was 45% with anterior wall hypokinesis.
4. Supravalvular aortography demonstrated a normal aortic root
and
ascending aorta with no regurgitation.
[**2150-11-12**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
[**2150-11-13**] Carotid Ultrasound:
1. A 40-59% right ICA stenosis, graded closer to 40%.
2. No significant left ICA stenosis (graded as less than 40%).

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79731**] was admitted under cardiology and underwent repeat
cardiac catheterization. Findings were notable for severe single
vessel coronary artery disease(multiple in-stent restenosis of
the LAD) with moderate systolic and diastolic ventricular
dysfunction - see result section for further detail. Based upon
the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted and further
evaluation was performed. Additional preoperative workup
included transthoracic echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound.
The ECHO showed an LVEF of 55-60% with only [**2-4**]+MR while carotid
ultrasound found only mild disease of the right internal carotid
artery - please see result section for further detail. Mr.
[**Known lastname 79732**]' preoperative course was otherwise uneventul. He remained
pain free on medical therapy and intravenous Heparin.

On [**11-17**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery - see operative note for further detail.
Following the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. The patient was
transferred to the step down unit where he made excellent
progress with physical therapy, showing good strength and
balance prior to discharge.  He does have a history of benign
prostatic hyperplasia, and did have urinary retention.  This was
managed with a foley catheter, with which the patient was
discharged and given instructions to follow up with his
urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59777**].  Additionally, he was started on Flomax.
 The patient was transfused two units of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 21.  Hematocrit rose appropriately.  By the
time of discharge on POD 5, the patient was ambulating freely,
the wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.
