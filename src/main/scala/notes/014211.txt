History of Present Illness:
74 yo with h/o CHF, COPD per chart presented to outside ED
presents with three weeks of shortness of breath. No chest pain.
There his oxygen saturation is 72% on 5l. He was started on
BiPAP and came up to 95%. Labs demonstrated leukocytosis to
29.4, lactate of 13.1 K of 8.0 and Cr of 2.2. AST was 4358 and
ALT was 4381. Alk phos 238. Tylenol level was 3. His mental
status deteriorated while on BiPAP and he was intubated and
placed on mechanical ventilation. ABG demonstrated 7.16/54/150.
He was given calcium gluconate, sodium bicarb, kayexalate, vanc
and levofloxacin and started on N-acetylcysteine and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**].
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was intubated and sedated, HR 80,
BP 107/49, satting 100% on vent. He was given 5 liters of saline
out of concern for sepsis. He was given calcium gluconate,
propofol asxtreoname and norepineprhine. In the ED there were
concenred for abdominal distension and a macerated wound of the
scrotum and pernium. Surgry was called, and were not impressed.
CT chest demonstrated b/l infiltrates. He was given 5L nS and
azrteonam.On transfer to the ICU his vital signs were HR 70 BP
100/70 RR20 97% vent. Lactate also trended down.

Imaging:
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mediastinal widening secondary to mild cardiomegaly and
lipomatosis, but no mediastinal hematoma.
2. Probable left upper lobe and partially resolving left lower
lobe
pneumonia.
3. Multiple chronic right-sided rib fractures.
.
CT Abd:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Small amount of perihepatic simple ascites.
3. Otherwise, no acute intra-abdominal process with no evidence
of
pneumoperitoneum.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function appears grossly borderline
preserved but views are technically suboptimal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free
wall contractility with some apical sparing of motion
(consistent with [**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign but not specific for pulmonary
embolus). There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 yo male presents with SOB, found to have septic shock, mixed
acidosis, respiratory failure and acute liver failure failure.
In terms of his shock, on admission, lactate was 13. CT chest
demonstrated evidence of pneumonia, suggestive of sepsis.  He
was given aggressive IVF fluid resusciation with NS, follow by
NAHCO3, and norepinephrine.  He was treated with
vanc/aztreonam/tamiflu.  His pressor requirement increased to 5
pressors and his vent setting was at maximum oxygenation.  He
had liver failure of unclear etiology, but was treated for
tylenol overdose with nac in case it was contributing.  He was
made CMO prior to further workup of his LFTs.  His family
arrived at his bedside and his partner said he never would have
wanted aggressive care.  He was terminally extubated with his
family at the bedside and he quickly passed away comfortably.
