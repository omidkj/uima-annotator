HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50 year old
male with a history of diabetes mellitus status post
laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**2-14**], who was
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] with hypotension, oliguria,
increased BUN and creatinine.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2-11**], which was negative and then
underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy on [**2-14**].  On
postoperative day #1, the patient was noted to have decreased
urine output and tachycardia with hypotension.  On [**2172-2-15**], the patient underwent a computerized tomography
scan which showed no ductal dilatation and was negative for
free air.  HIDA scan showed no excretion from the liver to
small bowel.  There was a questionable common bile duct
obstruction.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl and transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for further workup.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
asthma, status post cardiac catheterization [**2-11**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy [**2-14**], tonsillectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Insulin, Metformin, Klonopin,
Lisinopril, Ursodiol.

ALLERGIES:  Prednisone.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.  No pancreatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 99.5, 108, 142/72, 18, 92%
on 4 liters of nasal cannula.  The patient was alert and
oriented times three.  Oropharynx was clear.  Sclera was
anicteric.  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was
distended, tender, in the epigastric.  Wounds were clean, dry
and intact.  Lower extremities were warm without edema.

SUMMARY:  In summary the patient is a 50 year old male with a
history of diabetes mellitus who was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for workup of questionable
common bile duct obstruction, status post laparoscopic
cholecystectomy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was directly admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit where he had monitored hemodynamics, via
PA catheter to maximize optimal perfusion and was continued
on Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl antibiotics.  On
hospital day #2, the patient had a creatinine of 8.6 and had
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography done and
was given on Lasix 100 mg times one and the Renal Team was
consulted at that time and recommended decreasing all
antibiotics to renal dosing.  At this time, the patient's
creatinine was 9.5.  Lopressor was increased on hospital day
#3 for an increased blood pressure and the patient had
continued to have minimal urine output and a creatinine of
10.8.  The patient's urinary output picked up increased urine
output at 500 cc and hemodialysis was delayed.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed normal
biliary anatomy but, due to the severity of his condition at
that time, a 10 French by
7 cm cotton [**Doctor Last Name **]  biliary stent was placed successfully in the
common
bile duct.  At this point the patient's creatinine began to
rise to 12.2.

On hospital day #5, the patient remained in the Intensive
Care Unit with increase in creatinine, however, was having
good urine output.  The patient's creatinine began coming
down to 11.7 and with nonoliguric renal failure, the patient
was stable and was off of oxygen at this point.  He was
transferred to the floor, and taken off of fluid restriction.
He was given free access to water and Lasix was held.
Physical therapy began seeing the patient at this time no
acute distress continued to see the patient throughout his
hospital course.  On hospital day #7, the patient was
encouraged to ambulate and made 2 liters of urine output with
creatinine of 10.2.  The patient continued to do well on
hospital day #8 and antibiotics were discontinued.  The
patient was placed on p.o. medications and dialysis was
delivered for decrease in creatinine.  Other than
hyponatremia the patient had a benign examination and Foley
catheter was discontinued on hospital day #9.  Creatinine
continued to decrease to now 7, and was 6.1 on [**2-24**],
and on hospital day #10, the patient continued to be
encouraged to drink to thirst and physical therapy evaluated
the patient and had follow up with [**Hospital6 407**]
for home physical therapy.

The patient was discharged on hospital day #11 with a
creatinine of 3, was placed on diabetic diet and was
instructed to only take half of NPH and no regular insulin
until follow up with primary care physician for decreased
sugars in the daytime and was encouraged to drink as much as
he desired p.o. to keep himself well hydrated.  He was
encouraged to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at next available
visit and encouraged to follow up with primary care physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] also as soon as possible.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Percocet 5/325 mg tablet, one to two tablets p.o. q. 4-6
hours prn pain.
Lopressor 50 mg tablet, p.o., .5 tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Protonix 40 mg tablet, one tablet p.o. q. day
TUMS 500 mg tablet, one tablet p.o. q.i.d.
Colace 100 mg tablet, one tablet p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:

1.  Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
2.  Acute nonoliguric renal failure.
