Admission Date:  [**2130-1-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2130-2-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2061-12-10**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

DISPOSITION:  The patient is being discharged to [**Hospital1 2670**] of
[**Hospital 1514**] rehabilitation facility.  The patient will follow up
with dialysis at the BMA [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital3 1280**] Artificial Kidney
Center [**Street Address(1) 29296**], [**Hospital1 **], telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 29297**].

ADDENDUM:  Since the end of [**2129-12-27**], the patient has
been started on an angiotensin receptor blocker.  The patient
previously did not tolerate an ACE inhibitor secondary to a
cough.  As his dialysis now seems permanent, we were no
longer afraid of damaging his kidneys with an angiotensin
receptor blocker, and one was started and titrated up as
tolerated.  The patient's Neurontin was stopped as he has had
no more seizures and, most likely, there was a metabolic
cause of his seizures.  If he has another seizure in the
future, he will then have to go back on Dilantin.

The patient continued to be anemic.  His Epogen was
increased.  He was transfused for a hematocrit less than 30
and iron studies revealed that he had iron deficiency, so
iron supplementation was initiated.  Also, the patient's
fingersticks were running high, in the 150 to 250 range.  He
was placed on standing regular insulin and NPH insulin in the
morning and before dinner, as well as a regular insulin
sliding scale.  On this regimen, he exhibited much better
glycemic control with fingersticks ranging between 130 and
170.  These were slowly titrated up.  The current dosages
will be recorded on the page one information that will
accompany the patient but, initially, he was started on NPH 6
units in the morning and 3 units at night and regular insulin
3 units in the morning and 2 units at night.

The patient continued to receive dialysis three times per
week and is anuric, with less than 30 cc of urine output per
day.

Finally, a transplant surgery consult was obtained for
implantation of an arteriovenous fistula.  Their final
consult is still pending, but the attending will contact Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 29298**] to have the arteriovenous fistula planned, if not
soon after this admission, then at some point in the future.
The currently has a Quinton catheter in place, which is being
used with good effect.
