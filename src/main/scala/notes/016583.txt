Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 23753**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p TIPS procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TIPS

History of Present Illness:
47 yo F w/HIV/AIDS, HCV cirrhosis c/b varices, encephalopathy
and ascites, DVT w/recurrent PEs s/p IVC filter admitted s/p
elective TIPS w/embolization/coiling of gastric varices x 2. Pt
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-12**] w/GIB [**2-9**] esophageal varices. Was
readmitted ~1 week later with DVT and PE requiring IVC filter.
Pt returned to hospital in [**8-12**] w/pleuritic CP and found to have
new PE. Repeat EGD during that admission showed grade 3
esophageal varices which were banded x 3. Pt had difficulties
tolerating procedure and did not want to have repeated bandings
in the future, and thus it was decided that given extent of
varices and need for mult EGDs, TIPS would be a viable
alternative. Was subsequently started on heparin and d/c'd on
lovenox with plans to return for TIPS [**2178-9-2**]. Pt states she did
well over the weekend with no complications.
   Tolerated TIPS well with Hct stable. Post-procedure course
c/b fever to 101 and increase of LFT's and t.bili from 0.7 to
5.5. Was kept in the PACU overnight and vitals remained stable.
+c/o Nausea, pain controlled by IV morphine.

TIPS ([**2178-9-2**])
1) Successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
performed via the right internal jugular vein. The 10-mm x 94-mm
bare metal Wallstent extends from the main portal vein to the
distal right hepatic vein. Following deployment, the shunt was
sequentially dilated with a 10-mm balloon. The pre- TIPS hepatic
venous pressure gradient measured 23 mm Hg. The post-TIPS
hepatic venous pressure gradient measured 4 mm Hg.
2) Portal venography demonstrated significant variceal branches
from the left gastric vein. Two large variceal branches were
treated with absolute alcohol injection followed by microcoil
embolization. Post-embolization venography demonstrated
obliteration of the variceal branches.

Abd U/S ([**2178-9-3**]):
1) Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow.
2) Chronic cholecystitis.
3) Normal bile ducts.


Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo F with h/o HIV, HCV c/b cirrhosis and varices and 3 recent

admissions for GIB and 2 PE's respectively, now s/p TIPS
procedure with banding of varices.
1. HCV cirrhosis-Pt had a sucessful TIPS procedure. Post
procedure she had elevated LFTs, which was thought to be related
to post-TIPS and resolved over the course of the admission.
Unasyn started post procedure for fever spike, but later d/c. Pt
was called out of the unit after a 24 hour stay. U/S showed
patent TIPS. LFTS continued to decline while on the floor until
discharge. Pt D/c'd on lactulose
2. Fever- Post op fever covered with unasyn 3 gm IV q6 for
possible atelectasis. Pt became afevrile with negative urine and
blood culture.
3. PE/DVTs-s/p filter: Pts anticoagulation was held
periprocedure and restarted later in course due to a low Hct
(lowest was 26, recieved 2 units during stay) which responded
and remained stable. It was resarted on [**9-9**] with 10 mg coumadin
qd over two days, which brought her INR to 2.7, goal. She will
be D/c on coumadin 5 mg with INR check on Fri, and then every
few days, with results to be faxed to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].  4. HIV/AIDS:
HAART therapy stopped as LFTs increased but restarted on [**9-8**].
Bactrim continued for HSV and PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  CD4 and viral
load draw before D/c.
5. Anemia: Hct was low on [**9-6**], prompting two overall
transfusion over 48 hours which she tolerated well.
6. Depression: Effexor and Trazodone continued.
7. Pain: Oxycodone and IV morphine prn for pain mgmt. D/c with
oxycodone, two weeks supply. Pt has fentanyl patched at home.
8. IVDU: Continued Methadone in [**Last Name (LF) 103192**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] recieve it with
gentiva as outpt.
9. Wheezing/Asthma: albuterol inhaler prn.

Pt was D/c in good condition after successful removal of central
line with good hemostasis and dressing. Pt will follow up with
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] later this month and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in the future.
