History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69-year-old gentleman now almost 3 months after
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 12351**] [**Doctor Last Name **] esophagectomy complicated by leak. He has required 1
prior re-operation for anastomotic dehiscence. This was repaired
primarily, and he has had a long convalescence with both a small
esophagogastric fistula as well as a pancreatic fistula. Most
recently, he was re-admitted from rehab with a white count of
20,000 and a fever to 102 with bilious drainage from his
residual chest tube. CT
scan suggested undrained collection up near the anastomosis,
with moth-eaten bone in the posterior ribs. This suggested a
possible osteomyelitis or a sequestrum. As the tube was not
providing definitive drainage, I recommended creation of a
posterior [**Last Name (un) 72968**] window, and the patient agreed to proceed.

2. Open CCK
3. Diverticulitis

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is well-known to the thoracic service.  He returned
from rehab after spiking a temp of 102. Pt was admitted to the
thoracic surgery service on [**2110-11-4**] with a complicated hospital
course after which the pt expired on [**2111-1-7**]. On [**11-4**] empyema
tube fell out and was replaced. On [**2110-11-7**] pt went to the
operating room for bronchoscopy, flexible esophagoscopy, and
right posterior thoracotomy with creation of [**Last Name (un) 72148**] window and
primary suture repair of esophagogastric leak. On [**2110-12-24**] pt
underwent a tracheostomy, bronchoscopy with aspiration of
secretions and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. During his hospital
course the pt was placed on multiple antibiotic regimens due to
spiking fevers, diarrhea, and multiple positive cultures from
blood, wounds, sputum and drainage. He remained ventilator
dependant and was eventually fitted with a tracheostomy tube for
comfort. The pt received tube feeds through a jejunostomy
feeding tube. Hypercalcemia was present throughout most of his
hospital course for which he was followed closely by the
endocrine service. Calcitonin was ultimately given with good
effect in decreasing free calcium levels although the etiology
of the hypercalcaemia was never discovered. Renal function was
variable as monitored by BUN and Cr levels. Antibiotics were
renally dosed and adjusted as necessary for renal function. The
pt continued to require large volumes of both crystalloid and
colloid to maintain appropriate cardiodynamics and eventually
was placed on pressors. On [**2111-1-7**] during a family meeting, in
light of respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and
decreasing cardiac function, it was decided to withdraw
vasopressor support and make the pt comfort measures only. After
pressors were withdrawn, the pt expired within hours.
