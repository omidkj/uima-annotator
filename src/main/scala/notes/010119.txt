Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
slurred speech and confusion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2177-3-2**] - Intubation and mechanical ventilation
[**2177-3-3**] - Right shoulder arthrocentesis


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old male with cadaveric kidney
transplant ([**2163**]) on cyclosporine and prednisone, hypertensive
cardiomyopathy with LVOT obstruction c/b episodes of syncope,
initially presenting with several days of mental status changes
and slurred speech.  He has also been unable to ambulate, which
the wife attributes to increasing weakness.  She does not report
any localizing symptoms, including chest pain, SOB, new
cough/upper respiratory symptoms, diarrhea/constipation, blood
in stool, neck stiffness, headaches, dysuria, or urinary
frequency.  He was found to be bradycardic with HRs to the
20s-40s (with pauses) and thought to be in AF with slow
ventricular response.  He was given atropine, glucagon, and IVF
with minimal response.  CT head showed a pontine hypodensity
(with recommended MRI follow-up).  On admission to the [**Hospital1 1516**]
service, he triggered for hypotension with SBPs in the 90s and
as well as for deterioration of mental status and hypothermia to
92.  His wife reports that his face is "twisted" at baseline,
but his voice is usually much clearer. The EP service does not
believe that the bradycardia is contributing to mental status.
Nephrology Transplant is also following and does not believe
that uremia is causing his acute change in mental status or his
bradycardia, given his previously elevated BUN with
closer-to-baseline mental status.  Neurology was also consulted
and are preliminarily recommend LP and empiric coverage for CNS
infection, with the need for further imaging currently under
discussion.
.
He was transferred to the MICU service due to continued
worsening of his mental status with deterioration of his kidney
function with concomitant bradycardia and hypothermia,
concerning for sepsis.  He was started on empiric broad coverage
antibiotics with Vanc/Cefepime/Ampicillin.
.
In the MICU, he continues to be dysarthric and appears to writhe
in pain at random times, with an inability to communicate what
is wrong.  He intermittently follows commands and is oriented to
"hospital" but not the name of the hospital.  He continues to be
bradycardic with a wide pulse pressure.


Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension.
2. Hypercholesterolemia.
3. Left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertensive heart

disease with left ventricular outflow tract gradient (has had
problems with syncope in the past).
4. Chronic kidney disease status post cadaveric kidney
transplant in [**2163**]. Patient now with stage 3-4 CKD (eGFR 30).
5. History of syncope in the setting of dysphagia.

7. Gout
8. Anemia
9. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
10. BPH/elevated PSA
