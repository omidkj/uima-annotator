HOSPITAL COURSE:
Code status:  Shortly upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], discussion
was held with patient's family members to discuss her code
status.  It was explained that she likely was in sepsis and
underlying infection, and discussion was held about the
aggressiveness of treatment.  The family felt as though the
patient would have wanted to be comfort measures only and
that no further medical treatments should be done.  Her
medications were discontinued, and she was initially put on
IV fluids per family's request that were later D/C'd.  She
was placed only on a Morphine drip for comfort measures.

Overnight patient had systolic blood pressure to the 60s,
which slowly increased to the 100s the morning of [**4-7**],
however, approximately 11 a.m., her blood pressure again
began to decrease.  She was continued on the Morphine drip.
At 11:30 a.m., she expired.  The family was contact[**Name (NI) **] about
her passing, which was felt to be due to septic shock related
to a pneumonia and/or other possible infection.  The family
stated that the patient would not have wanted an autopsy, so
an autopsy was not performed.  The patient was pronounced
dead at 11:30.  The attending and the patient's primary
surgeon were notified.
