Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain, fever

History of Present Illness:
Patient is Cantonese only speaking, so history obtained with the
aid of patient's son.

History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old Cantonese
only speaking man with HTN, HL, and CAD s/p CABG ([**2118**]) with a
recent admission to the [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2124-6-4**] for
cholecystitis/duodenitis and sepsis treated with percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube. The tube had been draining approximately
100cc/day sine that time until 2 weeks ago when the output
increased to 200cc/day. He reported no symptoms at that time.
Friday prior to admission ([**9-1**]), he noted decreased output of
only 85cc, and the subsequent two days he noted zero output from
his perc cholecystostomy tube. He has had severe RUQ pain that
began on Saturday and has also noted yellow/greenish drainage
from around the drain site. He noted some shaking chills, but
denied fever, nausea or vomiting.  No urinary symptoms, no black
or tarry stool.  His inspirations are limited due to RUQ pain.
He called ems this AM becuase of the lack of drainage from the
tube and pain and they sent him to [**Hospital1 3278**] where his labs at 14:36
today were consistent with a cholestatic picture with ALT 169,
AST 244, alk phos 359, T bili 1.3, CRP 15.79, WBC of 6.5. Since
all of his previous care was provided here his family elected
for transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED, initial VS were:  101, 113/76, hr 100, rr16, sat99
2ln/c. He he continued to complain of RUQ pain and dyspnea from
splinting due to pain.  He was noted to have a R percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube on R lat side with green drainage coming
through around the tube and an empty bag, and RUQ tenderness.
He spiked to 101.8 at 6:30pm and was tachycardic to the low
100s. Labs were notable for worsening LFTs with ALT: 353, AST:
707, AP: 537, Tbili: 1.6. A left IJ was placed and he was given
2 L NS and started on Vanco, cefepime, and Flagyl. Surgery was
consulted and performed a fluro study of the tube and felt the
perc chole tube was patent and the cystic duct was patent and
emptied into the duodenum. There was noted to be a filling
defect in the distal CBD likely from a stone. He was admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ERCP. Surgery is also following to discuss the
possibility of cholecystectomy.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's vital signs were T 100.9, HR
101, BP 142/91, RR 24, O2 sat 91%RA (O2 sat increased to 96-99%
on 2L NC). He reported the history above with his son who aided
in interpretation. He continued to complain of RUQ pain and mild
shortness of breath due to splinting with deep breaths. Patient
did note baseline mild shortness of breath with increasing
activity, and had seen a pulmonologist recently who prescribed
[**Name (NI) **] (unclear if patient is actually using this).  He appears
to have a very good baseline functional status. He does [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor First Name **]
every morning and walks several blocks without dyspnea.

Discharge labs:




Studies:
[**2124-9-3**] RUQ u/s: The liver is heterogeneous in echogenicity with
a possible area of focal fatty sparing in the left lobe spanning
approximately 2.8 cm. This does not represent a definite lesion.
The gallbladder is collapsed, but does not appear mildly
edematous. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation and the common bile duct measures 8 mm. The spleen
measures 11.0 cm and is unremarkable. There is a 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.7
cm simple cyst in the right lobe of liver, corresponding to
prior CT. The main portal vein is patent and displays
hepatopetal flow.

IMPRESSION: 1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. 2. Collapsed gallbladder. 3. Heterogeneous liver
compatible with history of acute hepatitis or areas of focal
fatty deposition.

[**2124-9-3**] T-TUBE CHOLANGIO:
FINDINGS:  20 cc of Optiray iodinated contrast material was
injected into the patient's percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
under fluoroscopy.  The gallbladder followed by the cystic duct,
common bile duct, and common hepatic duct opacified without
evidence of obstruction.  No leak was identified. Contrast
passed freely into the duodenum.  Subsequently the
cholecystostomy tube was flushed with approximately 10 cc of
saline.

IMPRESSION:  Patent biliary system.  No malposition of the
cholecystostomy tube.
