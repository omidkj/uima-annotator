Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6565**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
54 F history of metastatic non small cell lung CA sp chemo and
RXT with invasion of esophagus and recent admission for
dysphagia sp dilation, ulcerative colitis on asacol, who
presents to ED with dyspnea. Dyspnea started yesterday acutely.
She was lying in bed and felt 1 hr of SOB, felt sensation of
labored breathing. Her Dyspnea resolved on its own yesterday
after 1 hr. No pleuritic chest pain, no chest pain, no
diapharesis. She has had a nonproductive cough for 1-2 weeks.
Denies fevers/chills, denies nausea/vomiting, denies abdominal
pain.  This AM, pt awoke, and felt another episode of dyspnea x
2 hrs. Denies any palpitations during this time. Symptoms
resolved on their own. She came to the ED for evaluation.
.
Recent admission [**Date range (1) 44469**] for dysphagia: Pt was admitted for
dysphagia to solids, on [**1-28**] had EGD for evluation and
dilation. During that admission, she underwent repeat endoscopy
and dilation on [**1-31**] with improvement of symptoms. Biopsy of
esophgeal nodule showed squamous cell CA. Pt was discharged with
follow up with oncologist.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, 96.8 150 158/95 18 99% RA. Pt
never had episode of oxygen desaturation. She had CTA showing no
PE, and questionable pna, so she was given: 3 L IVF, Levoflox,
Vancomycin. Mild movement in HR but continued in 120, always in
NSR. Formal echo performed by cardiology: pericardial effusion
(new, small, no tamponade physiology). Pulsus=8. Troponin neg
x1, EKG with no ST depressions or TWI, showed sinus tachycardia.
She was also given zyprexa for anxiety, guafinesin for cough.
Reportedly, she does have a history of chronic tachycardia in
the 120s, possibly from underlying malignancy.
Vitals prior to transfer: 98.3 128 135/77 22 99% 2LNC
Pt transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, dyspnea.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt reports feeling comfortable, with
improved breathing but still with some mild subjective feeling
of dyspnea. She denies any sensation of tachcyardia or
palpitations. However, she does note that whenver she comes to
the ED, her HR 150s. During her hospitalizations, doctors have
told [**Name5 (PTitle) **] that her HR is often 110-120s. Pt denies any productive
cough, but does have a dry cough x 1-2 weeks. Denies any choking
or aspiration episodes in the last few days-weeks. She states
difficulty swallowing the last day, says the pills seem to get
stuck in her throat. Prior to that, she had no problems
swallowing solids after her recent EGD and dilation on [**1-31**].
She has not been taking her pills over the last day due to her
feeling of dysphagia.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
-presented with back & right sided flank pain & was found to
have lung nodules on CXR, prompting chest CT that showed a LLL
nodule and mediastinal & hilar lymphadenopathy. Thoracic spine
MRI showed expansile T9 lesion c/w metastatic disease.s/p
palliative radiation to T7-11 spine & right ilium through
[**2143-7-29**]. She underwent Brain MRI [**2143-7-30**] which was (-) for
metastatic disease. Tumor was tested and EGFR mutation (-), KRAS
wild-type, and ALK (-).  S/p 4 cycles of taxol, carboplatin and
bevacizumab last given on [**2143-10-17**]
-[**1-/2144**]: Pt with dysphagia. Esophageal nodule bx showed
squamous cell CA.
.
Past Medical Hx:
-Ulcerative colitis x8 years, well controlled on Asacol. Never
required steroids
-GERD
-COPD
-Esophageal stricture-dilation c/b tear requiring left
thoracotomy and repair: [**2-/2141**], pt had dysphagia, which was
further evaluated with EGD, which demonstrated patchy mild
erythema in the duodenal bulb and in the 2nd part of the
duodenum. A mild Schatzi ring was found in the GE junction.
Dilation of the esophagus was attempted and complicated by acute
perforation of distal esophagus, resulting in need for thoracic
surgery for repair.

IMAGING:
.
[**2-6**] ECHO:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is a very small to small, circumferential pericardial effusion
measuring up to 1 centimeter in greatest dimension. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Limited study/Focused views. Very small to small,
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
evidence of tamponade.
.
[**2-6**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Left pleural effusion and worsening left basilar
consolidation, the latter concerning for pneumonia.
.
[**2-6**] CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, as questioned clinically.

2. Findings compatible with disease progression compared to
PET-CT [**2143-11-19**]. Extensive mediastinal adenopathy and confluent hilar soft
tissue have enlarged, as has a large soft tissue mass invading
the esophagus in its mid portion, obliterating the lumen. It is
unclear if this represents metastatic disease or primary
esophageal neoplasm and correlation with pathology is
recommended. Also progressed are numerous pulmonary nodules, as
detailed above.
3. Extensive perihilar and paramediastinal consolidation, which
has
progressed substantially from [**2143-11-9**] but is essentially
unchanged from [**2144-1-18**]. Given the short term
stability, infectious etiologies are less likely, though still
possible. More likely differential considerations include
developing radiation pneumonitis, as suggested by the
paramediastinal distribution, or alternatively direct extension
of hilar metastases.  Correlation with radiation history is
recommended.
4. New occlusion of the left lower lobe bronchus, with
persistent significant left lower lobe collapse.
5. Narrowing multiple pulmonary veins, with a focal
