Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to the LAD artery


History of Present Illness:
86 year old female who presented with nausea and chest pressure
X 1 day.  Nausea and substernal chest pressure began at 7pm 1
day PTA after dinner. Pt attributed sx to food, she thought to
settle her stomach she would eat more.  She recalls feeling
severe nausea.  She went to bed.  She awoke at 3am on DOA with
persistence of her symptoms.  At 6am, the pain was worse.  She
describes it as sharp, substernal [**7-1**], worse with inspiration.
It was associated with nausea.  She denied associated SOB or
diphoresis, radiation.  She also denied recent illness, jaw
pain, cough, diarrhea, hematochezia, or hematemesis.

She called EMS, at which point she received ASA 325mg.  Vital
signs initial vitals were pain of [**7-1**], temperature of 97.5,
heart rate of 71, blood pressure of 147/81, respiratory rate of
18, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.  On arrival she
received 75mg plavix, heparin bolus and drip. NG SL X 2 (SBP
dropped to 80s, w 1L IVF bolus).  SLNG relieved pain
temporarily.She was pain free at time of transfer but had been
reporting intermittent 2/10 chest pain.

On arrival to Far 6 at ~10:30am, she reported [**5-1**] CP.  ECGs
were concerning of ranterior STEMI with STE in V3-V5 and Q waves
in V4-6.  SBP 120, HR 60.  Code STEMI was called.  Pt was given
morphine 2mg, 525mg plavix, integrillin bolus (9800mg) and
infusion 100mg.  Rpt EKG consistent with STEMI with STE > 1mm
V3-V4, Q in V3-V5.
Pt has document h/o anaphylaxis to IV contrast in OMR.  She was
premedicated with 125mg solumedrol, 50mg benadryl. She was
transferred to the cath lab.  Mid LAD was found to be completely
occluded.  Vessel was revascularized with bare metal stent with
TIMI III flow.  She was then transferred to the floor.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PTCA COMMENTS [**2107-11-29**]:
Initial angiography revealed a totally occluded mid LAD. We
planned to
treat this occlusion with PTCA and stenting. Heparin and
Integrilin were
started prophylactically. A 6 French XB 3.5cm guiding catheter
provided
good support for the procedure. A Choice PT Extra Support wire
crossed
the occlusion with minimal difficulty. The lesion was dilated
with a 2.0
x 12mm Voyager balloon at 10 ATM. A 2.5 x 12mm Mini Vision bare
metal
stent was deployed in the mid LAD at 10 ATM. The stent was
postdilated
with a 2.5 x 8mm Quantum Maverick balloon at 20 ATM. Final
angiography
revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection,
and TIMI 3 flow. The right femoral sheath was sutured in place.
The
patient left the lab free of angina and in stable condition.


Catheterization COMMENTS [**2107-11-29**]:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated total occlusion of the mid LAD.  The LMCA had mild
disease.
The LAD had a mid occlusion.  The LCX had moderate disease.  The
RCA had
a 60% mid lesion and an 80% posterior lateral branch lesion.
The RCA
was diffusely disease in its entire course.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right ventricular
enddiastolic pressure of 12 mmHg.  The mean PA pressure was 32
mmHg
(phasic 45/22 mmHg).  The PCWP could not be determined due to
difficulties reaching the wedge position.  The cardiac index was

preserved at 2.6 L/min/m2.  The mean systemic arterial blood
pressure
was 101 mmHg (phasic 133/77 mmHg, with a systemic arterial
resistance of
[**2021**] dynes/sec/cm-5).
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with a 2.5 x 12mm
Mini
Vision bare metal stent which was post dilated to 2.5mm. Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically
apparent
dissection, and TIMI 3 flow. (see PTCA comments for details)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Total occlusion of LAD in mid vessel.
2.  Mild right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3.  Mildly elevated pulmonary artery diastolic pressure
indicating
volume overload.
4.  Preserved cardiac output with elevated systemic vascular
resistance.
5.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
6.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD.

[**2107-11-29**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis
to akinesis of the mid to distal septum, anterior wall, apex,
and distal inferior wall c/w mid LAD territory. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. The remaining left ventricular
segments contract normally. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are m
