History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 87 y/o woman with
multiple medical problems including [**Name (NI) 2091**] (b/l creatinine 2.1),
CHF (EF 45% in [**2189**]), pAfib on pradaxa, DM, Htn, colon cancer
s/p hemicolectomy [**2186**], who came to the ED today for
progressively worsening bilateral leg edema and pain for the
past two weeks. Denies trauma to the legs, medication
non-compliance, or dietary indiscretions. She has been wearing
her compression stockings daily, but does not typically elevate
her legs. She has accompanying dyspnea on exertion, but denies
chest pain, palpitations, cough, or syncope. She denies
headache, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.0, 65, 162/80, 18, 98%. She was
mentating appropriately. Exam was notable for 2+ pitting edema
to upper thighs, bilaterally. Her abdomen was nontender, and her
lungs were clear. Labs were most notable for elevated creatinine
above baseline, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. ABG was
7.14/48/65/17. BNP was > 12K. CXR showed pulmonary edema. ECG
showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, and
evidence of prior MI, without acute ischemic changes. Renal was
consulted, and recommended giving IV diuresis and obtaining
renal ultrasound. Pt was given percocet two tabs, IV
insulin/dextrose, calcium gluconate, and furosemide 80 mg IV. VS
prior to transfer were 98.0, 78, 16, 122/71, 100% RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is hungry and asking for food.
She reports constant burning pain in her lower legs and feet.
.
Review of systems: As Per HPI. Denies fevers, chills, cough,
headache, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria or polyuria. She has not noticed a change
in how much she is urinating.

MICROBIOLOGY
[**2192-2-3**] 11:23 pm MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.
                            **FINAL REPORT [**2192-2-6**]**
   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2192-2-6**]):    No MRSA isolated.
.
RADIOLOGY
CXR [**2192-2-3**]
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged. Mediastinal
contours are stable. There is moderate pulmonary vascular
congestion with interstitial edema. No large pleural effusion is
seen, although trace effusions be difficult to exclude. No
definite focal consolidation.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with fluid overload.
.
ECHO [**2192-2-3**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45 %). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Right
ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-7-12**],
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. The
right ventricular may be more dilated and hypokinetic, but was
not well visualized on the prior study.
