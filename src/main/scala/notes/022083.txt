History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 72255**] is a 55 year old woman with a history of chronic
alcohol abuse, asthma/COPD, and HTN who presented to [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital on [**7-8**] in NH with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
She drinks >5 drinks daily, including 2 morning drinks, and has
daily nausea and abdominal pain. Her pain become more severe and
persistent in the 3 days prior to her presentation to [**Location (un) 8641**].
She had no hematemesis, melena, fever, or cough.

At [**Location (un) 8641**], a CT scan showed evidence of acute pancreatitis with
a 9.1x4.8cm fluid collection consistent with pancreatic
pseudocyst without evidence of necrosis or infection. Her
[**Last Name (un) 5063**] score was 3 (WBC 17, LDH 510, HCT 45.4 --> 34.9). An
MRCP did not show evidence of communication between the
pancreatic duct and the pseudocyst.

She was treated with LR IVF resuscitation and dilaudid IV for
pain. On [**7-9**], she had a fever to 101.1. On [**7-10**], she spiked a
fever to 103.1. Blood cultures were drawn from both episodes and
are pending. She was tachycardic to 124, with stable blood
pressure. She was given flagyl 500mg and aztreonam 1g and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Regarding her alcohol withdrawal, she was placed on standing
ativan and CIWA protocol. She had been tremulous and irritable
and had one episode of hallucination but no seizures.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 98.5, 93, 133/80, 25,
96% 2 LNC.  The patient complains of fever, nausea, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, wheezing, anxiety.  Patient
denies any SI or HI.

Pertinent Results:
RUQ U/S [**2138-7-11**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Gallbladder sludge without evidence of cholecystitis.
2.  Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.  Other
forms of liver
disease including more significant hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis
or
steatohepatitis are not excluded on the basis of this
examination.
3.  7.4 x 5.6 cm fluid collection. In the setting of
pancreatitis primary
diagnostic consideration includes pseudocyst. Please compare to
the
(reportedly previously obtained) outside hospital CT.
4.  Small right sided pleural effusion.
.
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2138-7-13**] IMPRESSION:
1.  Slight interval increase in size of rim-enhancing organized
peripancreatic fluid collection.  Increase in extent of
unorganized peripancreatic fluid surrounding the pancreatic
tail.  Super-infection cannot be excluded by imaging.
2.  Moderate left and small right pleural effusions are new
since [**7-8**].

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old woman with a history of chronic alcohol abuse,
asthma/COPD, and HTN who transfered from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with
severe acute pancreatitis.

# Pancreatitis:  Patient presented to OSH with n/v and abdominal
pain; CT scan performed consistent with acute pancreatitis with
9 cm pseudocyst without necrosis. Pancreatitis likely secondary
to alcohol abuse.  CT  did not show evidence gallstones, no
biliary duct dilatation.  MRCP was performed and revealed a
unremarkable pancreatic duct.  Patient was treated with IV
hydration.  Patient received 1 dose of metronidazole 500mg and
aztreonam 1 g prior to transfer due to concern for sepsis (temp
to 103.1, sinus tach to 120's).  Patient arrived to the ICU with
stable vital signs, afebrile.  Blood cultures were sent.
Antibiotics were intially held to monitor for signs of
infection.  She was started on maintenance fluids and given
dilaudid PRN for pain control.  She was stable and transferred
to the floor on D3 of ICU stay.  On arrival to the [**Hospital1 **], pt. had
continued fevers, abdominal pain, and evidence of significant
alcohol withdrawal syndrome including tremulousness, anxiety,
tachycardia; fevers were concerning for delerium tremens vs.
representative of possible bacterial superinfection of her known
pseudocyst.  She was given valium with improvement.  Antibiotics
were resumed and surgery was consulted.  OSH images were loaded
to our radiology system and a repeat Abdominal CT was performed
for comparison demonstrating increased size of pseudocyst, and
ongoing significant pancreatic inflammation and peri-pancreatic
fluid including small bilateral pleural effusions.  She was
managed with bowel rest and aggressive IV hydration, along with
serial abdominal examination and ongoing surgical input.  She
was treated initially with Aztreonam and flagyl, and aztreonam
was later changed to Cefepime with plans for a 14-21 day course,
per Surgery recommendations.  Given her ongoing abdominal pain
and distention, she was kept NPO and she was started on TPN.
She will remain on TPN while her abdominal inflammation
decreases and her abdominal exam improves.  She is anticipated
to remain on TPN for approx 2 weeks before reinitiating diet.
SHe should remain on TPN and IV antibiotics until she sees Dr
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in followup.  Please make an appointment for her to
see Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] within 10-14 days.

# Alcohol Withdrawal:  Patient has significant history of
alcohol use (1 bottle of wine or vodka per day for several
years).  Patient's last alcoholic drink sometime between Friday
[**7-4**] to Sunday [**7-7**].  She was started on thiamine,
multivitamins, electrolyte repletion, as well as CIWA protocol.
She required significant doses of valium to control symptoms,
and may have experienced some autonomic labiity possibly
consistent with delerium tremens.  Suspicion is high for an
underlying cognitive impairment due to longstanding substance
abuse, possibly including the Korsokoff syndrome, as her
daughter reports that 'even on pts best days' she cannot
remember conversations from the day prior.  It remains unclear
how much of this encephalopathy is due to ongoing substance use
at home vs. fixed CNS injury.   Patient's mental status returned
to baseline by the time of discharge.

#Anxiety:  Patient started on
