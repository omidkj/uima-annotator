CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Headache.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 50-year-old Portuguese
speaking white female with severe headache with onset at 11
p.m. with loss of vision for a few seconds and nausea and
with a CT scan showing a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The
patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 **]
Hospital for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes a history of hypertension and
the patient has a report of being noncompliant with her
medications.
MEDICATIONS:  She is currently on no medications.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a healthy-appearing 50-year-old
white female, moderately built and nourished and seems to be
in moderate to severe pain at the time of admission.  She was
awake, alert and oriented to time, place and person.
Temperature was 99.3.  Blood pressure 166/85.  Heart rate 88.
Respirations 20, 02 saturation 97%.  The head was atraumatic
and normocephalic.  Pupils were 5 mm bilaterally reactive to
light.  Neck was nontender with no jugular venous distention.
There was mild resistance in tenderness to flexion however.
Chest was clear to auscultation.  Cardiac:  S1, S2 were
normal.  Extremities:  Warm, no edema, back was normal.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, bowel sounds present.  On
neurological exam, cranial nerves III, IV and V1 were intact
and extraocular movements were full.  Sensory exam:  Cranial
nerve V was normal.  Cranial nerve VII no facial droop.
Cranial nerves IX, X and XII tongue was central and uvula was
central.  Cranial nerve [**Doctor First Name 81**] scalene and trapezius were normal
strength.  All muscle strength in the bilateral upper and
lower extremities was [**4-15**].  Sensory was bilateral and equal.
There was no pronator drift and finger to nose test was
within normal limits.  A CT scan from the [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
which came with the patient on transfer to the [**Hospital1 **] shows evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage and no
evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 1132**] for urgent diagnostic angiogram.  There was obtained on
the evening of admission and the patient was subsequently
taken to the Operating Room where under a general
endotracheal anesthetic, the patient underwent a pterional
craniotomy and clipping of aneurysm.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well and went to the Neurological Intensive
Care Unit in stable condition and was maintained in the
Neurological Intensive Care Unit for several days.  She was
noted to have developed hydrocephalus and was taken back to
the Operating Room on the [**2180-9-26**] where, again,
under general endotracheal anesthetic, the patient underwent
placement of a VP shunt with high pressure valve.  This
surgery was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] again.  The patient
tolerated this procedure well and went back to the
Neurological Intensive Care Unit in stable condition and was
subsequently transferred to the floor.

However, several days later, the patient spiked a fever and
showed signs of infection.  Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained
from shunt tap which showed polymorphonucleocytes and due to
these findings, the determination was made to remove the VP
shunt and the patient was therefore taken back to the
Operating Room on the [**10-4**] where, again, under
general endotracheal anesthetic, the patient underwent the
removal of all the hardware for the VP shunt.  The patient,
again, tolerated the procedure well, went to the Recovery
Room stable and the remainder of her postoperative
hospitalization was essentially unremarkable.  She was
subsequently discharged home with arrangements for follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in the Clinic in approximately two to three
weeks time, as well as arrangements made for the patient to
have home visiting nurse and home physiotherapy assessments
at home health aid.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg q. 12 hours.
2.  Vancomycin 1 gram intravenous q. 12 hours.
3.  Zantac 150 mg po q. 12 hours.
4.  Percocet 1-2 tablets po q. 6 prn.
5.  Colace 100 mg po q. 12 hours.

The patient went home with a PICC line in place, as well as
the VNA Nursing for administration of her vancomycin.  The
vancomycin was to continue for a total of ten days, then the
PICC line was to be removed at a subsequent office visit.
