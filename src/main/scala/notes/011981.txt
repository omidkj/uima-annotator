Tunneled HD catheter placement [**2115-8-6**]
Transesophageal echocardiogram [**2115-8-7**]

History of Present Illness:
65 y.o male with pmhx of DM type 2, COPD on 2L home O2, and CKD
(recently started on HD in [**4-/2115**]), who presents with fevers,
hypotension.The patient was at dialysis, and reported fever up
to 100.0 with chills.Approx. 75 % of the dialysis was completed
per ems and he recieved total of 1.5g of vanco at the dialysis
center. The patient does make a small amount of urine at
baseline and denies dysuria. He endorses a nonproductive cough
for a couple days, but denies chest pain, nausea,
vomiting,abdominal pain, confusion, headaches, sick contacts or
recent travel.
.
Of note in [**4-/2115**] the patient started dialysis which was
complicated by MRSA bactremia, and hypotension. He was admitted
and had his dialysis line removed, TTE at the time negative for
endocarditis, he was discharged with new HD line and 6 weeks of
Vancomycin. He has been followed by outpatient [**Hospital **] clinic for
this and completed therapy in 6/[**2115**].
.
In the ED initial vitals were: 101.4 75 130/44 16 100% 2L Nasal
Cannula and the patient recieved 500mg Meropenem and 500mg p.o
tylenol. He became tachypnic to 40s and O2 sats down to low 90s
on 4L NC after 1 liter of NS and so put on bipap and went to
100% oxygen sat. He was weaned off of bipap after less than 1
hour and now resp status stable on 4L NC once again. He was
given 0.5 mg IV ativan for comfort.For hypotension with SBP
70's, a right IJ central catheter was placed and low dose
Levophed started with SBP's in the 90's.The patient was
transferred for further care to the ICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is off BIPAP and breathing
well. He is mentating well and the above HPI was obtained. He
says his breathing is "better." The below review of systems was
obtained including no chest pain, nausea, productive cough. He
has felt "crummy for few days" but will not elaborate.
