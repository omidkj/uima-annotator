Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Epigastric discomfort and lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2177-10-6**] Five Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to
LAD, with vein grafts to first diagonal, second diagonal, obtuse

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male who presented to OSH in mid
[**Month (only) 359**] with shortness of breath, gastric discomfort and
fatigue. He ruled in for a ST elevation MI. Subsequent cardiac
catheterization revealed severe three vessel coronary artery
disease and an LVEF of 36%. Echocardiogram at that time was
notable for an LVEF of 40% with inferior wall akinesis and
moderate mitral regurgitation. Patient was declined for surgery
at [**Hospital3 2005**](secondary to poor distal targets) and
eventually transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
treatment.

dobhoff placement
CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM
History of CABG.
Status post CABG. Distal end of feeding tube overlies body of

associated atelectasis in the visualized left lower lung. No
pneumothorax. The left subclavian CV line has tip located over
the proximal SVC.

associated atelectasis in left lower lobe, overall appearances
being essentially unchanged since prior study of [**2177-10-28**].

[**2177-10-3**] Non Contrast Head CT Scan:
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The ventricles are normal in size
and symmetric. There is no evidence of acute major vascular
territorial infarction. There are moderate cavernous carotid
calcifications. There is complete opacification of the right
maxillary sinus. The remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear.
[**2177-10-6**] Intraoperative TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
Pt requiring dobutamine infusion at 7.5
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 35-40 %), with basal to mid inferior and
inferior-lateral akinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.].
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild to
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen, with noted centrally
directed regurgitant jet. The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm.
7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened; there is
mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) tricuspid regurgitation.
POST-BYPASS:
Pt removed from cardiopulmonary bypass on vasopression,
milrinone, epinephrine and norephinephrine infusions and
placement of intra-aortic balloon pump.
1. Pt s/p mitral valve annuloplasty. There is no mitral
regurgitation.
2. Biventricular function is improved. Right ventricular is
normal sized and function has improved from moderate to mild
dysfunction. Left ventricular function remains globally
depressed; basal to mid inferior walls remain akinetic; there is
improvement of anterior wall function.
3. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation. There is an
intra-aortic balloon noted in the proper position.
[**2177-10-15**] Transthoracic ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring
is present. The mitral annular ring appears well seated and is
not obstructing flow. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
very small pericardial effusion most prominent around the right
atrium.
[**2177-10-16**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated native 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
had
diffuse mild disease. The LAD was occluded in the mid vessel.
The LCX
was occluded proximally. The RCA was occluded proximally. The
SVG-PDA
was patent with slow flow into a small PDA. The SVG-D1 was
patent as was
SVG-D2, both with slow flow into small distal vessels. The
SVG-OM was
patent with slow flow as well. The LIMA-LAD was patent. The LAD
beyond
the LIMA was diffusely small with slow flow.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The systemic
arterial pressures were borderline low measuring 86/63mmHg.
[**2177-10-20**] Non contrast Head CT Scan:
There is no sign for the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a question of a 1cm area of low density seen within the
region of the right uncus, which did not appear to be present on
the prior CT scan. If real, this finding could represent an area
of developing infarction. No other definite interval changes are
appreciated. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures.
