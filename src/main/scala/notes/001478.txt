GI bleeding due to Esophageal Ulcers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
89 year-old female with a history of bladder cancer metastatic
to liver who presents with melena, hematemesis. The patient was
initially evaluated in the emergency room and found to be
tachycardic and given IV fluids. The patient was transferred to
11 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**] where the patient triggered for tachycardia to the
130s. An NG lavage was done that showed coffee ground emesis
that cleared with 700 cc lavage. Shortly after the lavage was
finished a clot with bright red blood was suctioned from the NG
tube. At that point GI consultation was called who recommended
ICU transfer, pantoprazole IV drip and serial hematocrit.

In the ED the initial BP was 133/60 with HR 120s RR 16 with 02
sat 99% RA. She was given Pantoprazole 40 mg IV, zofran 4 mg IV,
kayexelate 30 gm, cipro IV and 0.25 ativan.

On arrival to the medical floor the patient was afebrile with BP
118-123/60-78, HR 120-130s 100% RA. On evaluation on the floor
and on ICU transfer the patient had only mild dizziness and
lightheadeness. She denies chest pain, abdominal pain.

She was also noted with increasing acute renal failure on her
stage III CKD.

ROS: In reviewing the recent weeks with the son, the patient has
had worsening mental status over the last few weeks, increased
weakness in the last month. She has intermittent presyncopal
episodes that have also been increasing in frequency. She has
had persistent LQ abdominal pain that is treated with meds
listed. The pain has been intermittently controlled. This is her
first episode of epigastric chest pain, hematemesis and melena
in the last few years. She has had poor PO intake in the recent
weeks.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2108-12-27**]  12:13:56 PM
Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Leftward axis. Late R wave

progression. Mild J point and ST segment elevation in the early
precordial
leads with Q waves through to lead V3 may be related to axis but
consider
anteroseptal myocardial infarction, age undetermined. Clinical
correlation is suggested. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2108-12-28**] 7:15 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse intrathoracic metastatic disease.
2. Likely mild volume overload.

ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of [**2108-12-28**] 8:14 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive infiltrative process in the liver consistent with
the history of metastatic bladder cancer.
2. Mild central biliary dilatation.
3. Lack of visualization of the left kidney.
4. Small aortic aneurysm of 23 mm in diameter.
CT could be performed, if clinically indicated, for a more
thorough staging assessment, and if available, comparison to
prior studies could be helpful.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2108-12-28**] 8:14 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Residual evidence of old nonocclusive bilateral lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis. It is unlikely that any of the
findings are acute or even recent.
2. [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst in the right popliteal fossa.
