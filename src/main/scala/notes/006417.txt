Pertinent Results:
[**4-25**] Noncontrast Head CT:
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. When compared to the previous exam, there is
an area of hypoattenuation involving the right basal ganglia,
which is new concerning for subacute infarction. There is a
moderate amount of periventricular white matter hypoattenuation,
predominantly seen in the frontal lobes, which appears stable
when compared to the previous exam. No new areas of
hypoattenuation are seen. Extensive atherosclerotic
calcifications are seen within the cavernous portion of the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally. There is opacification of
the left sphenoid sinus, which is unchanged when compared to the
previous exam. The paranasal sinuses are otherwise well aerated.
IMPRESSION: New area of hypoattenuation involving the right
basal ganglia compared to the previous examination, concerning
for acute infarct infarction. MRI with diffusion would help for
further evaluation.
.
[**4-25**] Brain MRI/A:
FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:
The diffusion images demonstrate an area of slow diffusion in
the right subinsular region and in the right frontal lobe
extending to the corona radiata indicative of an acute right
partial middle cerebral artery territorial infarct. There are
areas of chronic blood products seen in both cerebral
hemispheres including right basal ganglia which are unchanged
from previous study. Moderate diffuse periventricular
hyperintensities are seen indicative of small vessel disease.
There is no midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
IMPRESSION: Acute partial right MCA infarct involving the right
frontal lobe and subcortical region. Chronic blood products in
both cerebral hemispheres could be due to previous trauma,
ischemia or amyloid angiopathy.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates tortuous intracranial arteries. Distal
right vertebral artery is not visualized which could be
secondary to congenitally small vertebral artery. Both middle
cerebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal in the M1
segment with diminished flow signal in the sylvian branches
which could be technical in nature. No definite occlusion of the
MCA trunk is visualized.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of occlusion of the main MCA trunk is
identified. Diminished flow signal is seen in sylvian branches
of both middle cerebral artery which could be technical in
nature. Tortuous intracranial arteries could indicate
atherosclerotic disease.
.
[**4-26**] CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are new, small areas of
hyperattenuation in the region of the right basal ganglia
compatible with hemorrhage. Surrounding low-attenuation region
involving the right basal ganglia, subinsular region and right
frontal lobe appears larger and more well- defined when compared
to the previous exam. This is consistent with evolution of the
partial right middle cerebral artery infarct, demonstrated on
the DWI study. No extension of infarction is identified. There
is no significant mass effect, hydrocephalus, or shift of
normally midline structures. Moderate amount of periventricular
white matter hypoattenuation is stable. Also noted is apparent
ectasia of the left vertebral and basilar arteries, and
extensive intracranial vascular calcification.
IMPRESSION:
1. New areas of hyperattenuation within the region of the right
basal ganglia concerning for small ("petechial") hemorrhagic
conversion in the region of infarction. There is no significant
mass effect or midline shift.
2. Findings represent evolution of partial right middle cerebral
artery infarction.
.
[**4-26**] Abdomen/Pelvis CT:
FINDINGS: Left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural effusion
is slightly larger than two days prior. There is also some right
basilar atelectasis that is unchanged. Enlarged heart is stable.
Liver is unchanged with likely a cyst in the right lobe. Large
left retroperitoneal bleed is grossly unchanged from two days
prior. No new areas of hemorrhage are identified. The pancreas,
spleen, adrenals, right kidney, stomach, and bowel loops are
unchanged.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The bladder and [**Month/Year (2) 499**] are unchanged.
Uterus and adnexa are unchanged. Retroperitoneal bleed in the
pelvis is grossly unchanged.
BONE WINDOWS: The osseous structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the left retroperitoneal
hemorrhage.
.
[**4-27**]: Carotid U/S:
Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.
There is no plaque noted in the carotid arteries bilaterally.
On the right, peak velocities are 68, 67, and 73 cm per second
in the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent with
no stenosis.
On the left, peak velocities are 59, 81, and 59 cm per second in
the ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent with no
stenosis.
There is antegrade vertebral artery flow bilaterally.
IMPRESSION: Normal carotid study.
