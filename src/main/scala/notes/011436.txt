Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
66 yo male with h/o AAA, HTN, and remote Tobacco use (quit in
'[**49**]) who presented to the ED with chest pain, transferred to CCU
after cardiac catheterization for STEMI.  He reported [**8-2**]
substernal chest pressure that radiated to his back, between
shoulder blades, and bilateral arms.  He denies nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis.  He described the pain as a burning mid
chest pain that started over a week ago, which he thought was
heartburn.  Prior to admission, the pain had worsened and he
took two ASA at home.
.
In the ED, the patient was found to have BP 150s and HR in 120s.
 ECG showed 4-5 mm STE in II/III/AVF, depressions in V2-V6.  He
received an integrilin and heparin boluses, clopidogrel load,
and a nitro GTT.  Cardiac cath showed severe 3vd.  There was a
90% LAD stenosis at the D1 bifurcation with distal occlusion in
the RCA, but with collaterals from the LAD.  No intervention was
performed.  Cardiac surgery was consulted for emergent CABG, but
deferred due to anticoagulation load.  He was transferred to the
CCU, clincally stable with BPs around 100.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, cough, hemoptysis, black stools, or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors.  He denies exertional buttock
or calf pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain as described
above.  He denied dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Past Medical History:
seizure disorder
HTN
AAA - being monitored currently, dx 2 years ago

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use- used to smoke but quit in [**2149**]. There is no history of
alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Cardiac Cath [**12-9**] - 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed severe 3 vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA had mild diffuse disease with a 20% stenosis
throughout.  The LAD had a 90% stenosis at the D1 bifurcation.
The LCx had an 80% proximal lesion.
The RCA was markedly tortuous with large thrombus burden and
distal
occlusion.  Collaterals were present from the LMCA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
pressures.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Unsuccessful PTCA/PCI of the thrombotic and tortuous RCA.
Plan for
CABG this admission.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, with unsuccessful PCI
of
occluded RCA managed by medical therapy.
3. CT surgery consult for non-emergent coronary artery bypass
grafting.

TTE [**12-10**] -  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears
mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40 percent)
secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior free wall and
moderate hypokinesis of the posterior wall. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion

TTE [**12-12**] - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the inferior wall, distal septum and apex.
Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2174-12-10**], mild mitral regurgitation is now
identified with normal valve mophology suggestive of papillary
muscle dysfunction. Regional left ventricular systolic function
of the inferolateral wall is improved.

Port CXR [**12-13**] - In comparison with the study of [**12-12**], the
patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.  Blunting of
the costophrenic angles persists though there is no evidence of
acute pneumonia.  The cardiac borders and hemidiaphragms are
well seen on this study.

TEE [**12-14**] - TEE placed in the OR to evaluate etiology of
cardiopulmonary arrest. Suboptimal imaging is noted. There is
noted hemopericardium along the posterior aspect of the heart
measuring at greatest diameter 5.1 cm (This measurement was
taken after patient expired). There is no apparent aortic
dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo male with a history of AAA, HTN, and remote Tobacco use
(quit in '[**49**]) who presented to the ED with chest pain,
transferred to CCU after cardiac catheterization for inferior
STEMI.

1) Cardiac
Ischemia: The patient presented with a inferolateral STEMI and
underwent emergenct cardiac catheterization that revealed severe
3-vessel disease as per the cath report with failed PCI of the
tortuous, thrombus filled RCA. Cardiac surgery was immediately
consulted for a CABG and felt that the risks o
