Service:  [**Hospital 12145**] TRANSFERRED TO [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Per MICU house officer admission
note.  A 69-year-old male with past medical history of
coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction,
and status post CABG x3 in [**2154**].  He was transferred here
from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital for chest pain in the setting of
renal failure.  For the past three weeks, the patient has
been noticing increased difficulty urinating.  Previous
diagnosis of benign prostatic hypertrophy, but chose not to
intervene.

Three days prior to admission, the patient became anuric.  By
the day of admission, he was also experiencing shortness of
[**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he went to the hospital, Foley was placed, and 900
mL of urine came out with continuous flow afterwards.  Renal
ultrasound was performed which showed no hydronephrosis.
Creatinine on admission was 5.5, and it was 2.9 by the day of
transfer on [**2166-6-13**].

Otherwise, the patient had two episodes of chest pain while
moving around in bed, substernal 10-20 minutes relieved with
nitroglycerin.  Unclear if it was "gas pain or
musculoskeletal".  Patient complained of uncomfortable bed.
Specifically, the patient has left apical chest pain every
2-3 weeks with exertion, main anginal equivalent, and
shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**].  Cannot walk to mail box and driveway
without getting shortness of [**Year (4 digits) 1440**].  He does complain of
orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as left
lower extremity swelling.  His usual Lasix dose was 80 mg po
q day so worsening over the past year.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cells 9.5, hematocrit
36.9, platelets 173, INR 1.2, PTT 46.6.  Chem-7:  142, 4.8,
109, 22, 73, 2.3.  CK at outside hospital on [**6-11**]:  207, MB

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm at 57, normal axis,
IVCD of left bundle morphology, normal P-R, QTC, and small
Q's in II and F, poor R-wave progression, nonspecific T-wave
flattening inferolaterally, no acute ST-T wave changes
compared to electrocardiogram on [**2-14**], inferolateral T-wave
flattening is more pronounced.

CHEST X-RAY:  Heart is significantly enlarged, a few basilar
interstitial morphology increased, mild cephalization of
pulmonary vasculature.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was transferred from outside
hospital directly to the Intensive Care Unit for acute renal
failure and rule out myocardial infarction.  He was
transferred on a Heparin drip.

On night of admission, the patient had ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  His Heparin drip was stopped, also
given his history of significant bleed, patient had been
started on Integrilin and Heparin in [**2165-8-12**] and had a
subsequent bleeding ulcer melena requiring 10 units of blood,
therefore he had subsequently not been started on any
anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.  On admission to the
MICU, he was noted to have severe epistaxis.

Otolaryngology was consulted, who recommended Afrin, ice, and
pressure for 45 minutes and packing.  He packed his nose
without complications.  He was started on Keflex which was
continued for 48 hours while the packing was in place.
Packing was discontinued for 48 hours, and the patient had no
further episodes of nosebleeding, his hematocrit remained
stable not requiring any blood transfusion.

Also in the MICU, he had further episodes of chest pain
overnight, and was given sublingual nitroglycerin times many
with good relief of the chest pain.  He also had episodes of
bradycardia into the 30s which were asymptomatic, but noted
on Telemetry.  He was called out to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on
[**2166-6-14**].

The remainder of his hospital course will be summarized by
systems:  1. Cardiology.  A. Coronary artery disease:  The
patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft and
catheterization revealing occlusion of the saphenous vein
graft to the PDA.  Ongoing intermittent chest pain certainly
sounded atypical and pain was noted to be worse with
palpation, and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction with
enzymes with two negative at an outside hospital and one set
negative here.  He had a Persantine MIBI done on [**2166-6-16**]
which revealed an ejection fraction of 43% and moderate fixed
myocardial perfusion defect in the inferior wall and the
inferior aspect of the lateral wall.  Given that this defect
was fixed, it was decided to medically manage the patient for
his coronary artery disease.  He was continued on isosorbide
mononitrate, which was increased to his home dose of 60 mg po
q day.  He was continued on a low dose beta blocker.  He was
not started on an ACE inhibitor given his acute renal failure
and relative hypotension, and he was not started on aspirin
given his bleeding issues in the past.

B. Pump:  The patient has a history of congestive heart
failure with ejection fraction of 36% by catheterization.  He
was monitored for volume overload and Lasix was temporarily
held due to overdiuresis at the outside hospital, which was
restarted at his home dose of 80 mg po q day on the day of
discharge.

His ACE inhibitor was held secondary to renal failure and he
was continued on low dose beta blocker.

C. Rate and rhythm:  Patient clearly had a pacemaker
malfunction as his pacer was not responding to episodes of
bradycardia in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His
outpatient Electrophysiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] felt that this
was not clinically significant.  He is also noted to
