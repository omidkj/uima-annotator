Admission Date:  [**2191-5-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2191-6-6**]


Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unstable angina.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
89-year-old female with coronary risk factors including known
CAD, age, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with
a two week history of intermittent chest pain at rest with a
particularly severe episode occurring on the night of
admission at 7:30 p.m. while the patient was getting out of
bed.  She described the pain as [**10-7**] substernal "burning" in
quality.  No shortness of breath or diaphoresis.  No nausea
or radiation of the pain.  No pleuritic component to the
pain.  In the past, the pain has not necessarily been
exertionally related.

EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she was given oxygen, aspirin,
nitroglycerin, and her pain relieved on arrival to the
Emergency Department.  On arrival to the Emergency
Department, she was saturating 82% on room air which improved
to 92% on 4 liters.  She was given Lasix, started on
intravenous heparin, and intravenous Integrelin.  She became
slightly hypotensive to the sublingual nitroglycerin.  An EKG
was performed which showed normal sinus rhythm without pacer
spikes, however, showed [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevation in V1 through V4.
Therefore, she was taken directly to the Cardiac
Catheterization Laboratory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient complains of occasional
dyspnea on exertion without any orthopnea or PND.  She denied
any lower extremity edema, or recent changes in weight.  She
has not had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, cough, or
nasal congestion.  No change in bowel or bladder function.
No bright red blood per rectum or melena.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with transthoracic echocardiogram
on [**2190-9-10**] showing moderately dilated left
ventricle with anterior apical left ventricular aneurysm,
moderate depressed LV function, EF 30-35%, anterior, septal,
and apical akinesis.
2.  Status post myocardial infarction times two.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Status post pacemaker placement six years ago for
syncope.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Urinary incontinence.
7.  Lower back pain.
8.  Osteoporosis.

ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diovan 80 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone at an [**Hospital3 12272**] facility.  She has a remote tobacco history, quit 50
years ago.  No current alcohol use.  Her daughter is [**Name (NI) 19948**]
[**Name (NI) 19949**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19950**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.9, blood pressure 133/57, heart rate 72, oxygen saturation
100% on nonrebreather.  General:  The patient was alert and
oriented times three in no apparent distress lying flat in
bed.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular muscles
were intact.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive.
The oropharynx was clear.  Neck:  Jugular venous distention
to approximately 10-12 cm.  The neck was supple.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Bibasilar crackles approximately
one-third of the way up, scattered wheezes.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate, II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal
border, no rubs or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Rectal:  Guaiac negative per ED
report.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  Sodium 134, potassium 5.0,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 26, BUN 27, creatinine 1.0, glucose
157.  White count 11.0, hematocrit 41.1, platelets 219,000,
MCV 90.  PT 12.9, PTT 28.4, INR 1.1.

1.  Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2191-6-3**]:  EF 30-35%, no
pericardial effusion, left atrium moderately dilated, left
ventricular wall thickness normal, anterior apical left
ventricular aneurysm, and apical, anterior, and septal
akinesis.  Mild 1+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] findings were consistent with
transthoracic echocardiogram performed in [**2191-8-29**].

2.  EKG on admission on [**2191-5-30**]:  Q waves in leads V1
through V2, consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarct,
borderline first-degree AV conduction delay.

3.  Portable chest x-ray on [**2191-5-30**]:  Slight upper zone
distribution indicative of mild CHF, bibasilar atelectatic
changes, no pleural effusions.

4.  CT angiogram of the chest:  No evidence of pulmonary
embolism, diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities consistent
with mild pulmonary edema versus viral or eosinophilic
pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient
was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on
[**2191-5-31**] which showed left main coronary artery disease as
well as three vessel disease.  Left main coronary artery
showed 70% distal occlusion, LAD showed 50% proximal, 90%
mid, left circumflex showed 50% proximal, 80% major OM, and
RCA showed ulcerated 90% mid lesion.  Left ventriculography
showed an EF of 35%.

Given her findings of left main and three vessel disease,
Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted who felt that the
patient was not an appropriate surgical candidate.  Instead,
in consultation with the interventional cardiologist, they
felt that the main culprit lesion was her right coronary
artery which was stented on repeat cardiac catheterization on
[**2191-6-2**].  She did have a right dominant system.

During repeat catheterization on [**2191-6-2**], the right coronary
artery was initially balloon dilated and attempts were made
to place a 3 by 23 mm cipher stent.  She became hypotensive
and bradycardiac which required one dose of Atropine and
initiation of intravenous dopamine infusion.  It was noted at
that time that her peripheral IV was occluded and, therefore,
heparin and Integrelin were not being infused at the time.
Intravenous access was restored and she was administered the
Atropine, dopamine, heparin and Integrelin.  The RCA lesion
was then stented with a 3 by 15 mm Zeta stent.  The lesion
was then postdilated with a 3 by 10 mm NC raptor.  Final
angiography demonstrated the vessel to be widely patent with
no residual stenosis.  A right heart catheterization was
performed and an echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of
tamponade.

The patient then left the Cardiac Catheterization Lab and was
transferred to the Coronary Intensive Care Unit on dopamine.
Her dopamine was continued for approximately 24 hours, at
which time it was weaned off with stable hemodynamics.  After
the second cardiac catheterization, she had a bump in her
cardiac enzymes with an MB index reaching as high as 17.6.
Her CKs, however, were relatively mildly elevated at 194 with
CK MBs reaching as high as 31.  It was felt that she had a
post catheterization myocardial infarct which was responsible
for her transient hypotension.

Integrelin was continued for 18 hours and then weaned off.
Her heparin was discontinued while in the Cardiac Intensive
Care Unit.  She was continued on whole-dose aspirin and
Plavix for which she should continue for nine months.

Once blood pressure had stabilized and she had been off
dopamine for greater than 24 hours, her antihypertensives
were restarted slowly.  At the time of this dictation, she is
restarted on her Lopressor with hopes of restarting her
Diovan just prior to discharge.  Her blood pressure remained
stable in the 110s to 120s after reinitiation of Lopressor.
In addition, her cardiac enzymes were cycled after her post
catheterization MI and were all found to be back to baseline
at the time of dictation.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  On presentation to the
Emergency Department, the patient had an oxygen requirement
which was felt secondary to mild congestive heart failure.
She was diuresed with mild intravenous Lasix 10-20 mg IV
p.r.n. with good response.

By hospital day number two, her oxygen saturations had
returned to 100% on room air.  A transthoracic echocardiogram
and ventricul
