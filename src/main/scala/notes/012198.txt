EKG [**2179-8-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Minor non-specific lateral ST-T wave
abnormalities. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2179-1-15**] no significant change.

CXR [**2179-8-18**]:
FINDINGS:
Cardiomegaly is noted with pulmonary edema and trace pleural
effusions, right
greater than left.  No pneumothorax.  Bony structures intact.
Degenerative AC
joint arthropathy.
IMPRESSION:
Findings compatible with congestive heart failure.

CXR [**2179-8-26**]
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change.  Moderate fluid overload, combined to cardiomegaly and a
small right
pleural effusion.  Hemodialysis catheter in situ.  The
retrocardiac
atelectasis that pre-existed is less severe than on the previous
exam.  No
newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.


ECHO [**2179-8-19**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2178-1-19**], the findings are similar, but the
technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes
definitve comparison.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2179-8-20**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe 3 vessel CAD.  CAGG not a good option given no LAD or
RCA
targets.
2. Moderate elevated right sided and moderate to severely
elevated left
sided filling pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2179-8-30**]
COMMENTS:
1. Successful PCI of Ramus with Resolute 2.75 X 22mm stent
2. Successful PCI of LCX/OM1 with Resolute 2.75 X 26mm stent

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe 3 vessel CAD
2. Success PCI with DESs of Ramus (Resolute 2.75 X 22mm) and
LCX/OM2
(Resolute 2.75 X 26mm).
3. ASA 81mg indefinitely. Prefer Prasugrel 60mg load and 10mg
daily for
1 year. [**Month (only) 116**] change to Plavix 75mg daily after 6 month
uninterrupted use
of Prasugrel.
4. Risk factor reduction
5. A terumo pressure band was applied to right radial artery at
the
conclusion of procedure.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 M with complex medical hx incl ESRD, DM2, CHF, p/w NSTEMI.
Hospital course complicated by acute renal failure requiring
initiation of dialysis and staged cardiac catheterization.

# NSTEMI.

Pt admitted from OSH for unstable angina, found to have trop of
1.26 and elevated MB. ECG showed lateral ST-changes. Continued
on heparin and plavix loaded. On the floor pt denied CP, SOB. Pt
initially refused catheterization fearing it might lead to
accelerated need for hemodialysis. After several conversations
w/ attending physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] weighed risks and benefits of
procedure and agreed to proceed. Pt appeared overloaded prior to
procedure, and received 60 IV lasix X 2 with good urine output.
He was still mildly volume positive before catheterization,
judged to be acceptable in the setting of ESRD. He received left
heart catheterization [**8-20**], revealing signficant disease with
complicated lesions in his LAD and LCx. However, he received a
large amount of dye and his case was aborted given the desire to
avoid the need for hemodialysis given his ESRD.

The patient remained chest pain free between his diagnostic cath
[**8-20**] and therapeutic cath [**8-30**] on maximal medical regimen
including heparin gtt (48 hrs) ASA 325mg, plavix, metoprolol and
statin.

On [**8-30**], the patient had a DES to Ramus and DES to LCx/OM2. He
[**Month/Day (4) 8337**] the procedure well. He has follow-up with his
outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 41007**] in the coming weeks.

ESRD.

Pt had AVF placed six months prior to this admission, and
revision two weeks prior. Pt desires transplant and expressed
strong wish to postpone dialysis as long as possible. Renal
consulted for management of catheterization in setting of ESRD;
recommended simultaneous hydration and diuresis. Unfortunately
after cath [**8-20**], patient creatinine began to rise from 3.5 to
8.8, necessitating
