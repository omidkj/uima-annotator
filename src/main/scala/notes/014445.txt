ABDOMINAL U/S ([**2108-6-12**]):
1. No evidence for gallstones.  Small gallbladder polyp adherent

infiltration. Please note that other forms of liver disease
including significant fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on
the basis of this study.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pancreatitis: Presented with 3 days of abdominal pain in
setting of heavy alcohol use, with elevated lipase to 1800 and
CT scan confirming pancreatitis. CT scan read here just relevant
for acute pancreatitis with no evidence of pseudocysts or any
clear necrosis. Pain control was achieved with IV dilaudid
followed by PO dilaudid. Surgery consulted and did not see any
need for surgical intervention. When the patient had persistent
leukocytosis, repeat CT imaging was performed and showed
persistent necrosis but no organized fluid collection.  SUrgery
was reconsulted and recommended returning to NPO status, which
improved the symptoms.  SHe was slowly started on a diet but
continued to require dilaudid every 2 hours.  Since it may take
additional time for her pain to recover, she was switched to a
long acting morphine and this will be re-assessed in 2 weeks
when she sees her GI doctor.

2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient reported drinking one pint of
vodka every few days. She was placed on a CIWA scale with no
evidence of withdrawal.

3.  Leukocytosis: U/A dirty, repeated U/A still with some WBC
and prior UCx >100,000 EColi so have started treatment for
umcomplicated UTI with Cipro for 3 days.
-WBC can also be due inflammation from pancreatitis

5. Tachycardia: HR into 130s on presentation. Improved with pain
control and IVF.

6. Hepatitis C: Unclear if treated. HCV viral load positive.
Patient should follow up with PCP.

7. COPD: Unclear if per PFTs, but has long smoking history.
Maintained on her albuterol nebs prn.

8. Drug use: Social work was consulted on the floor for her
alcohol and drug use.
