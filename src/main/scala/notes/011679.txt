Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
altered MS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis [**2195-6-15**]
Diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis [**2195-6-15**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 yo w/ hep C cirrhosis on transplant list who was at
an OSH since [**2195-5-24**] where she was treated for hepatic
encephalopathy and failure to thrive. She initially presented
w/altered MS x 1wk. Of note, pt had been recently discharged
from [**Hospital1 18**] where she was treated for hydrothorax and
exacerbation of chronic abdominal pain.
.
Briefly, at the OSH, pt was initially taken off of Topamax which
had been started [**4-29**] and though to be worsening MS, Elavil was
also discontinued. LFTs and CBC were near pt's baseline. A GI
consult was obtained, they did not feel at that time that pt was
encephalopathic [**5-25**]. Thoracentesis was performed [**6-10**] for Right
sided pleural effusion. Per report, pt's MS improved [**6-12**]. She
was started on prednisone for a COPD flare and continues on a
taper. Micro data was negative and there was no incident of GIB.
There is no documentation of diagnostic paracentesis/blood cx.
.
Upon transfer, vitals were T 95.9 HR 99 RR 18 BP 128/81 sat
99%2LNC
.
ROS: Currently feels like MS is better but still feels confused.
She denies any pain, feels that chest is "congested" and w/cough
though it has improved. Also notes diffuse swelling which she
does not think is much better.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo F with hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted to OSH on
[**5-24**] for hepatic encephalopathy and failure to thrive and
transferred here on [**6-15**] to the hepatorenal service for further
mgmt. Pt was noted to have R hydrothorax which was tapped for
1.5 liters. She was also found to have an enterococcal UTI for
which she was treated with ampicillin/vancomycin. She was
starting to develop a hepatorenal picture on her first several
days on the floor, was aggressively diuresed with an increase in
creatinine and oliguria, then became anuric. She was then given
a fluid challenge with albumin and subsequently developed
pulmonary edema on the L side, requiring NRB. She was
transferred to the MICU on [**6-20**] and was intubated and started on
CVVH. Her R pleural effusion was tapped in the MICU; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
did not wish to have a pigtail catheter. She had a total of 72
hrs of CVVH. During CVVH, she was hypotensive, initially felt to
be hypovolemic (intravascularly depleted) and possibly septic
and her abx was broadened from ampicillin to cover enterococci
UTI to vanc/cefepime though all other culture data was negative.
Pt did not have enough ascites to tap. She was then noted to
have failed her [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim (she was previously on prednisone for
copd flare at OSH) and was started on stress dose steroids. This
was tapered to 10 mg po prednisone on [**7-2**]. On She is now
normotensive with sbp in 120s back on her home bisoprolol, which
has been titrated up. UOP has also returned and she was
restarted on lasix/aldactone. She was stable enough to transfer
back to the hepatorenal floor service by [**2195-7-3**] where she was
stable but with guarded status given her hepatorenal syndrome.
Her issues are summarized by issue below:
.
# Hepatorenal syndrome: Pt came in w/Cr of 1.2. and was rapidly
climbing. Urine studies were c/w HRS type/prerenal over ATN. Pt
was anuric after UF on [**6-20**]; UOP has returned. Off CVVH since
Friday [**6-26**], HD line dc'd [**6-12**]. However, the patient's Cr
remained at 1.9 which had been trending upwards. UOP slowing
down on the floor, so on [**2195-7-3**] she was started mitodrine 5mg
TID, octreotide 100mg SC TID. Renal was involved regarding
management of her fluid status as we would prefer to remove
fluid by HD to protect kidneys than give fluid by albumin as pt
had fluid overload, resp distress last time. The family is aware
that her status is guarded and after many discussions, the
decision was made to discharge her to home with hospice.
.
# Hypotension/Sepsis: Initially thought to be likely
multifactorial with the main component being recent
thoracentesis and then HD session with removal of 2L of UF.
There was mild response from SBP of low 80s to high 80s after
500 cc bolus of IVFs and 1 unit of PRBCs. However, MAP began to
drift below 60 in AM of [**6-21**] and pt was started on levophed. BP
also began to fall after intubation, may be due to meds v.
positive pressure ventilation (however, higher PEEP seems to be
improving aeration of R lung). Pt is less likely to be septic
given HR, lack of fever, lack of leukocytosis though pt began to
deteriorate after switching from vanc to amp. The patient's
antibiotic coverage was broadened in the ICU to cefepime/vanc as
pt began to deteriorate after switching from vanc to amp for
enterococcal UTI-treat for a two week course ending on [**7-6**].
Adrenal insufficiency now considered to be primary cause. By the
time she was transferred from the ICU, she was off all pressors,
and antibiotic coverage for sepsis. Her BP ran high so she was
restarted on bisoprolol 10mg daily which was discontinued on
[**2195-7-3**] as her BP was starting to trend downwards. The patient
was also restarted on midodrine and octreotide to maintain her
BP.
.
# s/p Hypoxic respiratory failure in the ICU: This is likely due
to pulm edema after fluid resuscitation in the setting of R
hydrothorax and anuria, also mental status.
Per liver, no pigtail catheter as patient was still being
considered for liver transplant. She was successfully extubated
on [**6-29**], satting well on room air. On the floor after
transfer from the ICU, the patient's respiratory status has been
stable.
.
# Adrenal Insufficiency- The patient had an abnormal [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim
test while septic, so given stress dose steroids and quickly
tapered off steroids by [**2195-7-4**]. Her blood pressure remained
stable off the steroids.
.
#Hypernatremia-likely secondary to intravascular volume
depletion. The patient's tube feeds were adjusted to correct for
hypernatremia.
.
#Hyperglycemia: Likely exacerbat
