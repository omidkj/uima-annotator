Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 39 yo with no records and no contactable family member, who
presents with Baclofen, trileptal, and fluoxetine overdose.
.
# Baclofen overdose is known to cause intermittent coma and
delirium, consistent with her admission presentation. Trileptal
causes sedative effects; fluoxetine can cause serotonin syndrome
but the patient had no evidence of this.  Neither did she have
EKG changes suggestive of SSRI overdose.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
intubated for airway protection and toxicology was called who
recommended supportive care for all sedatives.  Baclofen can
lower seizure threshhold, but Ms. [**Known lastname **] did not have seizure
activity and was not prophylaxed for this.  She had a fairly
prolonged course of delerium/agitation and was thus kept on the
ventilator for 3 days. She was sedated with propofol rather than
benzodiazepines.  when she was alert with improved agitation she
was extubated and has done well from a respiratory stand point.
She has since expressed anxiety/fear and depression but no
active suicidal ideation.  Psychiatry has been following and
recommended prn haldol for anxiety.
.
# Ms [**Known lastname **] had an isolated fever on HD 3 and had sputum,
urine, and blood cultures sent.  Her urine and sputum were + for
E coli (pan-sensitive) and her sputum was also + for staph
aureus (pan-sensitive).  She was therefore treated with Bactrim
but refused the medication and then was switched to levofloxacin
for three days.
.
# Code: full

.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, all
were in agreement that Ms. [**Known firstname 34822**] [**Known lastname **] was a suitable
candidate for transfer to inpatient psychiatry.
