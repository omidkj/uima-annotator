Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 22 year old female with Type I DM complicated by
gastroparesis, chronic abdominal pain thought secondary to
chronic pancreatitis and severe personality disorder admitted
with diabetic ketoacidosis.  Her hospital course is as follows:
.
DKA: The patient was admitted with an anion gap of 20 in DKA.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn, but the cause was thought
to be due to medication non-adherence.  She was aggressively
volume resuscitated and started on an insuling drip and admitted
to the MICU.  Her anion gap corrected quickly.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and recommended resuming her NPH at 30units [**Hospital1 **] as
well as a HISS.  She was tolerating small POs.  Her blood sugars
were stable in the low 200s on transfer from the MICU.  On the
floor she was generally non-compliant with her fingersticks and
her diet. Whenn they were checked they were in the 200s range.
.
Chronic Abdominal Pain: The patient has not receiving opiates
from her outpatient physician because of drug seeking behavior.
She has broken pain contracts in the past and is trying to find
a PCP that id willing to prescribe her medication.  LFTs were
mildly abnormal but RUQ was unremarkable.  She was initially
treated in the ICU with her PO dilaudid 2mg PO q6prn as well as
diazepam 5mg PO q6prn.  The patient would benefit from detox
placement but she declined.  She often complained that 2mg was
not touching her pain and she needed more.  After speaking with
the patient's guardian, the decision was made not to continue
her pain medications further.  We feel that the pain meds is
causing her more harm than good.  The patient was not given any
pain meds at discharge and I would recommend that she not be
given any in the future unless any significant pathology is
found.  The patient was given reglan to help with nausea
symptoms that she may experience with withdrawal.  She was
encouraged to take her diazepam as well.
.
Depression: Her seroquel and diazepam were continued with good
effect.
.
Asthma: Stable on her outpatient regimen
.
Dispo:  The patient was discharged to her group [**Last Name (un) **] ein stable
conodition.
