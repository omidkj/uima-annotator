upper GI bleed

EGD with esophageal banding.


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
51 yo F, hx etoh abuse, who was doing well until about one year
ago when she was diagnosed with cirrhosis.  Apparently, the
patient went to her PCP and was sent for an ultrasound.  She was
given the dx of cirrhosis at that time.  Over the following
year, the patient did not follow up with her physician and she
continued to drink alcohol.  In mid-[**Month (only) **] ([**2125-6-28**]), she began
vomiting blood at home.  She did not go to the hospital at that
time.  The pt continued vomiting and decided to go to OSH ED 3
days later ([**7-1**]).  She was admitted at that time with Hct=14
and SBP=80's.  During her hospital admission, she had an
EGD/esophageal banding of varicies.  She had a few episodes of
melena, but no further hematemesis.  She was discharged after 5
days.

After returning home, she did not have any further bleeding and
had abstained from EtOh, without any dk stools, melena, BRBPR,
hematemesis, F/C, nausea, abd pain, no dysuria, + BLE edema.
About 2 weeks later, she was in the car with her sister, and
began vomiting blood/clots again.  Her sister brought her to OSH
([**Hospital1 1562**] on [**7-21**]).

Pt admitted to OSH [**7-21**] w/episode of hematemesis of clots, then
500cc BRB en route to OSH. At OSH ED p 114, bp 88/49pt had
massive hemoptysis, intubated for airway protection (ABG
7.43/26/81). They thought that earlier banding 2-3 weeks ago may
have dislodged. Pt tx w/endoscopy, hypertonic saline inj. Tx w/
4U PRBCs, hct 24-23! Given more units PRBCs, hct 31 prior to
transfer, INR 1.9, alb 2.0, tbili 23.6, dbili 15.4. Tx w/vanco
x1, zosyn x1.

Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of
varicies and liver disease.  She was admitted to the MICU and
given an aditional PRBCs and had another EGD.  Patient was
intubated for airway control.  GI performed another esophageal
banding.  Pt did not bleed further.  She was extubated [**7-24**] and
did well.  Only concern was patient's decreased mental status
s/p extubation thought to be related to receiving Ativan.  Prior
to admission, she was fully functional, occupied as a teacher.
She was teaching until 3 weeks prior to this admission.

A/P:
51 yo F, hx ETOH abuse, hx recent variceal bleed at OSH [**6-15**] tx
w/banding, now represents after [**2-13**] wks w/recurrent UGIB,
hematemesis, hct 24->29.8 despite 6U PRBCs and hypertonic saline
injection at OSH, hypotensive to 90s, +NGT lavage.  Patient now
transferred from ICU with Hct 39 and no active bleeding.  Pt
with leukocytosis (25) with CXR LUL infiltrate and mild decrease
in MS.

1) UGIB
-esophageal varices (given acute blood loss, recent hx
w/banding, EGD at OSH); pt s/p transfusion and banding in ICU,
now stable
-NPO, IVF, IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], octreotide gtt (50mcg)
-cont octreotide gtt
-cont. propranolol for variceal bleeding prophylaxis
-maintain 2 large bore IVs
-consider possible TIPS, will follow with GI

2) Cirrhosis: pt w/ h/o cirrhosis (Class C), although no biopsy
proven dx; RUQ u/s w/dopplers w/patent PV, ascites, retrograde R
sided flow, anterograde L sided flow; pt with high INR (1.9 s/p
vit K) and high bili (25). Not transplant candidate.
-follow LFTs, coags, plts, alb, bili: alb still low, tbili
-Liver following with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10285**]

3) Ascites: diagnostic tap in AM [**7-23**].  removed 4.5 liters of
fluid which showed 30 WBC, 95 RBCs with
11poly,32lymphs,25monos,29macs, and total protein less than 0.3
and albumin less than 1.
-prophylactic SBP tx w/ CTX x 5 days ([**Date range (1) **])
-Follow wbc count and temp curve
-Lasix, aldactone and prn paracentesis.

4) Encephalopathy: pt received ativan in ICU, possibly cause of
decresaed MS.
[**Name14 (STitle) **]/c ativan, haldol for agitation
-start lactulose

5) Leukocytosis: pt has wbc=25 but afebrile, s/p tap --> no SBP.
 CXR shows ?LUL infiltrate.  WBC count rising despite
ceftriaxone.  Concerned for hospital acquired/vent associated
vs. aspiration pneumonia.
-will cont ceftriaxone for pneumonia coverage
-will add Clindamycin for better staph/anaerobic coverage

6) Anemia: pt currently not actively bleeding, s/p transfusion,
Hct stable at 39.
-follow Hct

7) ARF: pt initially in prerenal ARF, likely volume depletion,
now resolved. Cr=0.9
-follow Creatine

8) FEN: pt lytes wnl, except low bicarb.  will follow
-nutrition via NG tube

9) PROPHYLAXIS
-pneumoboots, PPI IV

10) FULL CODE: discussed with sister, would like full code for
now until quality of life/life expectancy can be discussed with
Liver Team.  [**Month (only) 116**] be changed in the near future.

11) DISPO
-will be evaluated later in hosp course; unclear endpoint now.
