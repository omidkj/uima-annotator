Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
81 year old man with CAD s/p CABG in [**2103**] with a LIMA to the
LAD, SVG to the PDA, SVG to the OM, HTN, IDDM, PVD s/p bilateral
LE bypass, CRI, admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital [**1-7**] with
shortness of breath and chest pain x one week. Initially thought
to be rest angina. Ruled out for MI, no EKG changes. Transferred
here for cath.
In holding area pt had chest pain, no EKG changes. Underwent
difficult catheterization today(received large amount of
radiation)which demonstrated severe native three vessel disease.
The left main was heavily calcified with an 80% distal stenosis.
The left anterior descending received blood from the LIMA graft.
The left circumflex demonstrated a 90% ostial lesion. RCA was
diffusely diseased. The LIMA-LAD graft was patent. SVG-OM
patent; SVG-RPDA patent with an 85% mid RCA lesion. No attempt
at PCI today due to excessive radiation dose and dye dose. Pt
scheduled for for planned PCI to the SVG-rPDA and possible LMCA
intervention on Monday.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective cornary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
unable to be
engaged selectively despite using a 4 french JL4, JL4.5, JL5.  A
five
french JL5, JL4.5, AL1, AL2, and AL3 were also unsucessful.  The
LMCA
was heavily calcified and had an ostial plaque.  There was an
80% distal
LMCA lesion that involved the origins of the LAD, ramus, and
[**Month/Day (4) **].  The
LAD had a functional ostial stenosis (extended from distal
LMCA);
signficiant proximal stenosis; and minimal flow into the mid
LAD.
Overall, the LAD was not able to be well visualized because of
difficulty engaging the LMCA.  The [**Month/Day (4) **] had a 90% stenosis in the
origin
that extended from the distal LMCA.  The AV groove [**Month/Day (4) **] supplied
a
diffusely disease OM1 (up to 70% stenosis) and LPL.  The ramus
was not
well seen but had an ostial 80% stenosis.  There was heavily
calcified
plaque in the aorta at the origin of the RCA.  The RCA had heavy

calcification proximally with 70% and 90% stenoses.  The mid
vessel had
a 50% stenosis. The distal RCA was a tortuous vessel that
supplied a
long lower acute marginal with lateral branches that supplied
the
inferior septum.  The native AV groove RCA was heavily calcified
and
subtotally occluded after the take-off of the large lower AM.
2.  Venous conduit angiography revealed an SVG to OM (engaged
with a 5
french AL2) that was patent thoughout and touched down onto the
lower
pole OM that does not communicate with the native AV groove [**Name (NI) **].
 The
SVG-rPDA (engaged with 5 french MPA) had an ostial 30% and mid
85%
stenosis; this graft retrogradely filled a severely diffusely
diseased
distal AV groove RCA that gave septal collaterals to the LAD.
3.  Nonselective arterial conduit angiography revealed a patent
LIMA
with a 30% ostial stenosis that touches down on a small calibur,
heavily
calcifed LAD (not well imaged).
4.  Left subclavian angiography revealed a heavily calcifed
vessel with
a proximal 50% stenosis.  The left subclavian stenosis prevented

advancement of a 4 french [**Female First Name (un) 899**] catheter despite use of an angled
glide
wire, slip catheter, and Amplatz stiff wire.  A 4 french
Berenstein was
ultimately advance to the subclavian distal to the LIMA over the
angled
glide wire.
5.  Left ventriculography was not perfomed secondary to renal
insufficency.
6.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated systemic systolic
hypertension
with a central aortic pressure of 167/68 (systolic/diastolic in
mmHg).
There was severe diastolic dysfunction with an LVEDP of 32 mmHg.
 There
was no gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
.
[**1-14**] Cardiac cath:
1.  Planned intervention of a 90% body of SVG-PDA lesion
with direct stenting with a Vision 3.5x18mm stent.
2.  Limited hemodynamics with BP 142/59 with HR 55 with
significant
ventricular ectopy.
3.  Access via 6F long sheath in RFA.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Succesful direct stenting of SVG-PDA graft with bare metal
stent.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
#. CAD: The patient presented to an OSH on [**1-7**] with shortness
of breath and chest pain. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cathterization. This diagnostic procedure on [**2115-1-11**] was
complicated requiring a signficant amount of dye and radiation,
therefore, the intervention was planned for another day. It
demonstrated severe native 3vd, patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, 90% [**Date Range **]
ostial lesion, diffusely diseased RCA with 85% lesion and patent
SVG-RPDA. He received Reopro post cathterization and developed a
hematoma requiring a pressure dressing. The patient developed
refractory chest pain without ECG changes before the
intervention could be performed, and was transferred to the CCU
for monitoring and management.
In the CCU, he was given Argatroban for ACS (reported concern
re: HIT). He had cardiac cathterization on [**2115-1-14**] with
intervention and stenting of SVG-RCA. His sheath was pulled
while on Argatroban and the patient developed a significant
hematoma requiring 2 units pRBC transfusion. The next day, the
patient developed stuttering chest pain and plans were made to
take him back to the cath lab for possible intervention on left
main or RCA. He was transitioned from a nitro gtt to isosorbide
for the chest pain. He was started on argatroban prior to the
procedure. He underwent a third catheterization on [**1-17**] with
stenting to his L. Subclavian.  He subsequently remained chest
pain free. He was continued on aspirin, Plavix, statin, and
Toprol. No further events occured, chest pain had resolved and
he was sent home on the above medications.
.
#. Systolic Heart Failure: An echo was performed which showed EF
60%.  Patient was continued on his Lasix and his beta blocker
was increased.
.
#. Rhythm: Patient in normal sinus rhythm during most of his
hospital stay, however during the CCU he had a few episodes of
bradycardia and his beta blocker was held. This was subsequently
resumed prior to discharge.
.
#. Diabetes-Patient was placed on an insulin sliding scale and
placed back on his home glyburide prior to discharge.
.
#CRI-Baseline 2.2 at OSH. It initially increased after the first
catheterization but subsequently improved after post-cath
hydration and IVF.  His creatinine was monitored and remained
stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.  All of the
medications were renally dosed and he received pre- and
post-cath hydration for each of his procedures.
.
#Hematuria-Pt has gross blood in foley which was thought to be
related
