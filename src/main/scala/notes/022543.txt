Admission Date:  [**2142-7-10**]              Discharge Date:   [**2142-7-17**]


Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-7-12**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 5 (Left internal mammary
artery to Left anterior descending, Saphenous vein graft to
diagonal 1, Saphenous vein graft to diagonal 2, Saphenous vein
graft to obtuse marginal, Saphenous vein graft to posterior
descending artery)

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86-yo man with no significant past medical
history who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2142-7-7**] with weakness,
edema, and weight gain. He has had a progressive decrease in his
functional status over the last 2-3 months. He has also been
having progressively worsening leg and scrotal edema, and
15-pound weight gain, over the same amount of time. This is a
significant change from his baseline, as he was previously a
very healthy and active person, going to the gym 3-4 times
weekly. The symptoms started around the same time as his wife
suffered from multiple CVAs, so the family was concerned that
this was a manifestation of depression.
.
On presentation to [**Hospital1 **], he was found to be in acute
systolic CHF and was diuresed. NT-proBNP was 10,679 and cardiac
enzymes were negative (CK 226, MB 8.6, trop <0.03). ECG showed
NSR @ 100bpm, LAD, IVCD, and LVH. TTE [**2142-7-9**] showed a dilated
LV w/ normal wall thickness and severe global HK, EF <20%, mild
MR, mild TR, severe pulmonary hypertension, dilated and
hypokinetic RV, and mild [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement. He had a cardiac
catheterization today to evaluate for coronary disease and was
found to have diffuse disease including 95% distal LMCA, 95%
proximal and mid-LAD, moderate D1 disease, 90% proximal LCx,
moderate proximal RCA, 90% distal RCA, and PCWP 25mmHg. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for evaluation by cardiac
surgery for possible CABG, and the films are being sent over
with him. VS prior to transfer include BP 109/92, HR 85, R 20,
SaO2 96% RA. Reportedly in the ambulance he had PVCs / NSVT and
became transiently hypotensive in that setting, as well as
developed an oxygen requirement, so he is being transferred to
the CCU for closer monitoring. On arrival to the CCU he is in no
pain and feels that his breathing is "normal".

Past Medical History:
s/p hemorrhoidectomy
s/p repair of anal sphincter
s/p cataract surgery

Social History:
Lives by himself. Usually very active.
-Tobacco history: Occasional cigar smoker many years ago.
-ETOH: None.
-Illicit drugs: None.

Family History:
Sisters with [**Name2 (NI) **] in their 80s, brother died of an MI at age 68.
No known family history of early MI, arrhythmia,
cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise
non-contributory

Pertinent Results:
[**7-16**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an apical
aneurysm (LVEF = 20 %). The basal anterior septum contracts
best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-7-11**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is lower. The left ventricular cavity
is also slightly smaller. Global LVEF is similar.
[**7-16**] CXR: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is
persistent opacification at the bases, especially on the left,
consistent with small pleural effusion and atelectasis. There
could be a tiny pneumothorax.
[**7-11**] CNIS: Right ICA no stenosis. Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 80219**] presented to [**Hospital1 **]
with acute systolic heart failure. He was appropriately
medically managed and underwent cardiac catheterization to
evaluate for coronary disease and was found to have diffuse
disease including 95% distal LMCA, 95% proximal and mid-LAD,
moderate D1 disease, 90% proximal LCx, moderate proximal RCA,
90% distal RCA, and PCWP 25mmHg. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation by cardiac surgery for possible bypass surgery.
He was medically managed in the CCU with appropriate surgical
work-up and on [**7-12**] he was brought to the operating room where
he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 5. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Patient remained intubated with balloon pump for a
couple days after surgery. On post-op day two balloon pump was
weaned off and removed without incident. Also he was from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op
day three he was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. During post-op course he worked with physical therapy
for strength and mobility. On post-op day five he appeared ready
for discharge to rehab facility for additional PT. He was
advised to take prescribed medications and contact physicians
for follow-up appointments.
