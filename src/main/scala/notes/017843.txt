OPERATIVE REPORT

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Enterocutaneous fistula.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Difficult abdomen enterocutaneous
fistula. Multiple adhesions and multiple enterocutaneous
fistulas.

INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  I heard from a hospital in [**State **] in which he had undergone surgery for
intestinal obstruction. Apparently the procedure was
extraordinarily difficult and after a number of hours there
were multiple enterotomies which could not be dealt with. At
least 3 loops of bowel, according to my findings today, were
brought out through an incision and the incision was closed
thus giving him loss of domain and incisional hernia. At that
point the operation was terminated and he was later referred
to me with a wide open central abdominal wound with multiple
loops of bowel on the surface and an abdominal fistula. The
nutritionalist assisted the patient including 3 days
preparation in which he had a quick burst of around-the-clock
enteral nutrition to increase his transferrin to 231 from the
situation in which he previously had a transferrin down
around 110. He had lost about 30 of 40 pounds. The following
procedure was carried out.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Under satisfactory general anesthesia
the patient was placed supine and prepped and draped in the
usual manner. Before draping the incision, the old
gastrostomy tube was removed and a new fresh sterile
gastrostomy tube was calibrated at the appropriate level and
sewn in with some FiberWire.

We began the operation by extending the incision cephalad and
inferiorly and it was a relatively small incision through
which it would have been difficult to do the operation. As it
turned out we used the entire length of the midline incision
in the abdomen. We began the incision superiorly entering the
abdomen above the liver without making any enterotomies and
without making any holes in the liver. The bowel, as one
would expect, was intimately associated with the abdomen. We
isolated the small bowel loops after very strenuous
dissection and very difficult with the bowels. The bowel
really matted to each other. We were able to get him back to
having one afferent limb and one efferent limb which we then
placed [**Doctor Last Name **] Kochers and then resected the bowel. The
mesentery, which was a single mesentery across these loops,
had approximately 15 inches to 18 inches of bowel attached to
it, but he had ample bowel remaining so that nutrition
__________. with 4-0 and 2-0 silk, mostly 2-0, until we had
gotten the loops of small bowel, 1 proximal and 1 distal,
immediately adjacent to each other. There was a slight
difference in caliber because the top part of the anastomosis
had had some food passed through it in the past and the
distal had not had any food for approximately about 10 months
and so there was complete diversion. As a matter of fact in
the colon, there was some stool balls in the right colon and
they had probably been there for 10 months. We had tried to
enematize them prior to the operation without success.

After this we carried out a two-layer silk, 4-0 silk
anastomosis in end-to-end and had ligated the mesentery and
sutured the mesentery before we had put these 2 loops of
bowel together. The blood supply was excellent and we were
very happy with the anastomosis. The fistula which has a lot
of skin attached had also been resected prior to doing this
and this was satisfactory as well.

It then became time to mobilize the abdominal wall widely to
repair his incisional hernia which was brought about by the
previous operation carried out elsewhere. This was done with
immobilization of the entire area and was extensive enough to
require #19 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains in the subcutaneous area.

Gloves, gowns and drapes were then changed. The wound was
closed in layers with #1 Prolene in running fashion on the
fascia, 3-0 Vicryl as the subcutaneous closure. This was
difficult in the area below the umbilicus but this was
successfully carried out with interrupted vertical mattress
of 3-0 nylon. The superior portion was closed with 4-0
Monocryl and 3-0 Vicryl. Estimated blood loss was 150 cc. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. Two sponge counts,
needle counts and instrument counts were reported as correct
by the nurse in charge.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2151-2-28**] under the care of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].  TPN was continued.  Preoperative labs showed TRF
135; Albumin 3.3; Baseline pCO2 44.  Preoperatively Hibiclens
washes were provided and he was given a prep of
Neomycin/Erythromycin.  He was taken to the operating room on
[**3-4**] where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy; lysis of
adhesions; gastrostomy tube change; enterocutaneous fistula
resection; primary anastomosis; w/ repair of incisional hernia.
He tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the ICU
postoperatively for closer monitoring.  Pain was controlled via
epidural and PCA. At POD 1 he was afebrile and with good urine
output. Hct was 26. He was transferred to the floor. At POD 3 he
received 1 unit PRBCs for a Hct of 24.0. The narcotic component
of the epidural as discontinued.  We continued to await bowel
function. At POD 4 Reglan was started. He was afebrile and
ambulating. At POD 6 he was febrile to 101.5.  The epidural was
removed. CXR showed LLL PNA.  He was (+) flatus. He was
tolerating clear liquids.  The incision site, particularly
around the G-tube, had a moderate amount of erythema/purulent
drainage.  Vancomycin/Cefepime/Flagyl were started for empiric
coverage. Blood/Urine cultures were negative for growth.
Incisional drainage was (+) for yeast; enterococcus; MRSA.
