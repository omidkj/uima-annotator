Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH with hypotension and elevated troponin.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old female with h/o type II DM, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, and recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer
([**6-/2198**]) awaiting Whipple procedure, who presented to [**Hospital1 3325**] on the day of admission after a mechanical fall.  EMS
VS en route to [**Hospital3 3583**] were BP 142/74,  HR 90, RR 20,
100% 2L.
.
Per patient, she was sitting on the toilet having a BM when she
slipped off the toilet seat onto the floor.  Says that she did
not experience any lightheadedness, dizziness, palps, or chest
pain prior to the episode.  There was no LOC.  She recalls the
entire event.  A friend found her on the floor and helped her
onto her feet and called an ambulance.
.
At OSH ([**Hospital3 3583**]) her vital signs were 97.4, HR 68, RR
20, BP 78/56, 99% 2L.  Subsequently she was noted to be
hypotensive to SBP 60s, she was given 1.5 liters IVF with SBP to
80s and started on dopamine gtt.  She was noted to have STE in
leads I and aVL and also a troponin I of 3.67 with flat CKs.
She was started on a heparin gtt with bolus.  A head CT at OSH
showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
At baseline, patient says she lives independently and is able to
carry out ADLs and most IADLs.  She denies exertional angina
although to be fair, does not regularly walk up stairs or
long-distances.  ROS positive for one loose bowel movement on
morning of admission, no blood and no mucous.  No abdominal
cramping or pain.  She denies fevers, chills, N/V, or decreased
PO intake in days leading up to admission.  She denies dysuria,
cough or URI symptoms.  ROS positive for malaise during the last
several months and weight loss of twenty pounds which is
attributed to her recent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer
([**Date range (1) 9184**]) made by ERCP at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Of note, patient was recently treated for UTI with 7-day course
of ciprofloxacin.

([**Date range (1) 18128**]) included following:
* [**2198-6-28**] - ERCP: attempted but failed to cannulate the CBD,
cannulated the pancreatic duct and placed a proximal stent. No
distal pancreatic duct obstruction (ductal width not specified)
* [**2198-6-29**] - repeat ERCP: CBD cannulated - very tight 3cm distal
CBD stricture, brushing cyology suspicious for carcinoma. Stent
placed.
* CTA pancreas [**2198-6-29**] - 1.6 x 1.9 pancreatic head mass
consistent
with adenocarcinoma of uncinate process without CT evidence
vascular invasion or significant adenopathy

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse. There is no family
history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.
Lives in [**Location 3320**], is widowed with 3 children who live near by.
Retired and lives independently.

Family History:
Non-contributory

<b><u>IMAGING/RADIOLOGY<B><U>
EKG on [**2198-7-30**]: Normal sinus rhythm with indeterminate axis. Low
QRS voltage throughout, most pronunced in the limb leads.
Anterior myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. ST-T wave
changes are suggestive of ischemia in the anteroapical region.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-7-13**] QRS voltage is lower
throughout. Anterior Q waves are more pronounced and anterior ST
segment changes are new.
(When compared to previous EKG's from OSH from as long a [**8-3**]
mos ago no significant changes)
.
TRANSTHORACIC ECHO ([**2198-7-30**]):
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
walls, distal inferior and lateral walls, and apex. The apex is
aneurysmal with a 2.3cm mural thrombus. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). The estimated cardiac index
is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution and extending to
apical right ventricle). Apical left ventricular aneurysm/large
mural thrombus. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
VENOUS LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS ([**2198-7-30**]):
No DVT seen in either leg.
.
Persantine Stress Test [**2198-8-1**]:
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ST segment changes in
response to
dipyridamole infusion. Nuclear report sent separately.
IMPRESSION:
1. Fixed distal anterior and inferior as well as apical defects
along the
distal anterior and inferior walls as well as apex consistent
with known
anterior wall MI with apical aneurysm.
2. Images at the apex are limited but there is likely
paradoxical motion of the known left apical ventricular
aneurysm.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80-year old female with h/o type II diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent diagnosis of
pancreatic cancer who presents from OSH s/p mechanical fall with
hypotension and elevated cardiac markers.
