Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with a history of NSTEMI in [**2101**]
(no cath or stents), moderate AS (AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2 on TTE in
[**2101**]), HTN, COPD/emphysema transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for
cardiac catheterization after having been worked up for CP x2
days and found to have an NSTEMI.
.
The patient does not recall having had chest pain ever in the
past (despite a h/o MI and having been on Nitro SL prn). Last
Thursday, she was visited by her cousins and developed 60 min
lasting midsternal, pressure-like chest pain (w/o radiation)
that night. It was [**2108-5-28**] in severity and responded immediately
to one dose of SL nitro. She went to her PCP the next morning
and was sent to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]. Of note, she has noticed
bilateral ankle edema for about one week. In addition, she had
been short of breath on mild exertion for about one year. She
notes SOB after having walked from her bedroom to her kitchen.
She denies any orthopnea or PND. Also no aggravation of SOB over
the last week although her ankle edema developed since then.
.
At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], her VS were stable in the ED (T 99.9, HR 89, BP
159/76, RR 18, 96% on RA). The initial EKG showed PR
prolongation, LAD, TWI in I, aVL, later also with TWI in V1 to
V6 which persisted throughout the hospital stay. She was found
to have an NSTEMI with peak troponin of 0.94. CXR was without
any acute findings at the time of admission. During her hospital
stay, she was started on an IV heparin drip, and received
Plavix, Lopressor and oxygen. She had four more episodes of
chest pain (twice yesterday and twice today) which were managed
with IV Lopressor, IV morphine and IV nitroglycerin with
occasional BP drops on higher doses of nitro. Her last episode
of CP was associated with radiation to the right of her lower
chest. She was eventually kept on Nitro and Heparin drip until
she was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] for cardiac catheterization in
the morning.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Positive for chronic dry cough (secondary to emphysema per
patient). Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems positive for CP, SOB and ankle edema
as above. Negative for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**Name (NI) 4565**]. His name is [**Name (NI) **] and his phone number is

Initial EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] demonstrated prolonged PR interval
(236), LAD, TWI in I, aVL, later also with TWI in V1 to V6 which
persisted throughout the hospital stay. EKG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] showed
also a PR prolongation of about 240, similar TWIs in
anterolateral leads and one ST elevation in V2 (less than 1 mm).

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2102-9-6**] demonstrated:
Views were extremely limited. LA normal size. LV and RV not well
visualized. Unable to assess EF. Asc aorta moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate AS
(AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2). No AR. MV leaflets mildly thickened. No
pericardial effusion.
.
CXR: [**2105-5-1**] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with no acute cardiopulmonary
process. Admission CXR at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 86**] also without any acute
findings (prelim read).
.
Cardiac cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
two vessel disease. The LMCA had mild plaquing but no critical
stenoses.
The LAD had a complex calfified, ulcerated 90% stenosis in the
mid-vessel after the D1 branch, which had 50% ostial and 70% mid

stenoses. The LCx had mild diffuse disease. The RCA was totally
occluded
proximally and filled via left to right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an opening aortic
pressure of
133/68mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. The mid LAD lesion was predilated with 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 2.5
mm
balloons, stented with 2.5 mm and a 3.0 mm bare metal stents and
post
dilated with a 3.0 mm balloon with lesion reduction from 90 to
0%. The
final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis,
no
dissection and no embolisation. (see PTCA comments)
5. Successful closure of the R femoral arteriotomy with a 6F
angioseal
device. (see PTCA comments)
.
TTE [**2105-5-5**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
16-20 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall and apex.
There is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments. No
intraventricuclar thrombus is seen. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets and supporting structurs are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitat
