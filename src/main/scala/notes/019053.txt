History of Present Illness:
75 y/o F hx CAD with ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p ICD, HTN, DM,
CVA now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up of GIB. She
presented to OSH on [**2-26**] with black tarry stools since Sunday.
She also had N and coffee ground emesis X 2 (~ 2 cups dark brown
fluid). She reportedly denied abd pain at the time, but had been
taking aspirin and aleve [**Hospital1 **] for arthritis pain. She was also
c/o weakness and fatigue. She denied any CP, palpitations,
BRBPR, hemetemesis, fevers.
.
At OSH, initial HCT was 18 although she was hemodynamically
stable with BPs in 100's. R fem line was placed in OSH ED. NG
lavage revealed yellow clear fluid with speckles of blood clots.
She received sandostatin 100 mcg/hr, FFP X 2, 1U plts, and 6U
PRBCs. EGD at [**Hospital1 **] revealed some small esophageal varices and
evidence of portal HTN gastropathy. No ulcers were seen. Also,
Pt was found to have troponins which peaked at 18, CKMB 9.
Creatinine was 1.5. Abd U/S revealed trace ascites, and liver
described as fatty infiltration. Hepatitis panels were negative.
.
Upon transfer, she reports feeling very tired but otherwise
denies any pain. She had been at Foxwoods and did not wish to
leave which is why she waited 2 days to go to hospital. She
reports that 10 yrs ago she had one episode of dark emesis and
was told she had a bowel obstruction. Otherwise, she had never
had other GIB. She had been taking Aleve 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] and aspirin
X 2 weeks for shoulder pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
## Upper GI bleed requiring blood transfusions: The patient
presented with weakness and melena to OSH. Although the pt's HCT
was 18 on arrival to the OSH, she was hemodynamically stable,
suggesting a slow bleed.  At the OSH she received 6 units
pRBC's, FFP, PPI, ocreotide and Cipro - Cipro for GIB in the
setting of possible cirrhosis. An EGD demonstrated gastropathy
and ? small varices. Likely source is from gastritis versus
esophageal varices versus HTN gastropathy. Although she has been
taking NSAIDS and ASA, OSH EGD did not note ulcerations. As she
had no hx of cirrhosis, she was transfered to the ICU here for
furhter w/u. However, gastritis is also a possibility given
recent NSAID use. On admission, here ASA and carvedilol were
originally held. She was maintained on octreotide gtt for 36
hrs, changed to protonix IV BID after a day and was on Cipro for
five days. Her HCT on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] was 35 and remained
around 35 during her stay. As she remained stable she was slowly
restarted on carvedilol and lasix. She remained HD stable and
required no blood transfusions in-house. Patient plans to have
repeat EGD as outpatient, and if persistent varices may require
initiation of nadolol. She was transitioned to an oral PPI prior
to discharge.
.
## New diagnosis of liver disease: Pt has no known history of
liver disease, although OSH U/S reported fatty liver.
Interestingly, U/S at [**Hospital1 18**] did not reveal fatty liver and LFTs
have normalized. Transaminitis in the setting of UGIB and shock
liver could potentially have caused transient rise in LFTs. Hep
panel neg and no hx of EtOH abuse. Autoimmune work up negative.
Ceruloplasmin PENDING at this time. Iron/TIBC 254/339 = 75%
might be consistent with hemochromatosis but may be inaccurate
in the setting of multiple units PRBC. Patient likely has some
underlying compoenent of NASH, however her gastropathy, varices,
and splenomegaly are more likely secondary to her her cardiac
dysfunction and poor EF. Patient scheduled to follow up with
Hepatology as an outpatient. She will need a repeat endoscopy.
.
## Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 89 to 110 in house. Marked
splenomegaly on ultrasound in setting of liver disease could be
responsible for low platelet count. Cipro can cause low
platelets, but this has not worsened since she has been on
quinolone.
.
## NSTEMI: Likely demand ischemia insetting of low HCT. CK
trending down. Did have episode of asx NSVT in ICU, but patient
was off betablocker. No significant events on tele on medicine
floor. Patient was mainta
