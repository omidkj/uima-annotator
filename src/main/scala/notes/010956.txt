Chief Complaint:
+ Stress Test, referred for Cardiac Cath

Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
81-yo-woman w/ DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, and PVD was admitted to
the CMI service yesterday after 2 months of worsening dyspnea on
exertion.  She describes shortness of breath after climbing 1
flight of stairs, assoc w/ a "band" of chest "heaviness" across
the upper sternum.  This sensation occured reliably w/ climbing
stairs, and always resolved within a few minutes after resting.
There were no assoc palpitations, cough, diaphoresis, nausea, or
vomiting.
.
She had presented to her PCP with the above symptoms and was
evaluated w/ an adenosine ETT on [**6-12**], demonstrating
reproducible symptoms w/ ST depressions in the inferolateral
leads.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday for cardiac
cath, which revealed extensive CAD including left main and 3

Currently, she feels well.  Denies any dyspnea or chest
heaviness since admission to the hospital.  ROS reveals no
fever, abd pain, dysuria, melena, or hematochezia.

Pertinent Results:

distal stenosis. The LAD was calcified proximally with a 60% mid
vessel stenosis. The D1 had a 60% ostial stenosis. The ramus
intermedius had a 80% ostial stenosis. The LCX and its OM
branches were without flow limiting disease. The RCA had an 80%
ostial stenosis and a 40% mid stenosis. The ostial PDA had an
80% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided
filling pressures with LVEDP=26 mmHg. No pressure gradient seen
on catheter pullback from the left ventricle to the ascending
aorta. Moderate systemic arterial hypertension.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated preserved systolic
function with LVEF=60%. Mild 1+ mitral regurgitation seen.

.
Carotid U/S:  Bilateral 40-59% carotid stenosis.
.
Vein Mapping: Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins with a
dilated vein on the right with reflux bilaterally below the
knee.
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets and supporting
structures are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5936**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-6-21**] for further
work-up of her chest heaviness. A cardiac catheterization was
performed which revealed left main and severe three vessel
disease. Given the severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical
service was consulted for surgical revascularization. Ms. [**Known lastname 5936**]
was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. An
echocardiogram was performed which revealed normal valve
function. A carotid duplex ultrasoound was performed which
revealed bilateral 40-59% stenosis of the internal carotid
arteries. Vein mapping was performed whcih showed ptent
bilateral greater saphenous veins with a dilated vein on the
right with reflux bilaterally below the knee. On [**2199-6-27**], Ms.
[**Known lastname 5936**] was taken to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels. Postoperatively
she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 5936**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. Her chest tubes and
wires were removed per protocol. She developed atrial
fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone. On postoperative
day three, she was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down
unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility.
Keflex was started for mild leukocytosis. She continued to make
slow but steady progress with the plan to discharge to
rehabilitation. On [**2199-7-9**], prior to her discharge, Ms. [**Known lastname 5936**] [**Last Name (Titles) 67539**] bradycardia and respiratory arrest. She was
resuscitated and returned to the intensive care unit. An echo
revealed no significant abnormal findings. The Electrophysiology
service was consulted and the plan for a pacemaker was
addressed. Her medications were adjusted to prevent further
bradycardia. She was extubated on [**2199-7-10**] without complication.
She underwent left thoracentesis for 600cc of pleural fluid. She
again had bradycardia with getting out of bed and a temporary
pacing wire was placed. On [**2199-7-15**], Ms. [**Known lastname 5936**] was taken to the
electrophysiology lab where a [**Company **] sigma pacemaker was
placed. Interoggation of her pacemaker found it to be
functioning normally. On [**2199-7-16**], she was transferred back to the
step down unit for further recovery. On [**2199-7-17**], she had left arm
swelling and an ultrasound revealed subclavian clot. Heparin and
coumadin were started for anticoagulation. The vascular surgery
service was consulted who agreed with the plan to give coumadin
with heparin as a bridge for 6 months.
On [**7-22**] it was determined that the pt was stable and ready for
transfer to rehabilitation at [**Hospital 745**] Healthcare Center.
