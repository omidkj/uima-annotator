DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED; RENAL U.S.; -59 DISTINCT PROCEDURAL
SERVIC   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 81938**]
Reason: RENAL FAILURE,DOPPLER KIDNEYS




Provisional Findings Impression: TKCb FRI [**2148-12-6**] 4:13 PM
Examination limited by inability to breathhold. There is flow
within both
renal arteries. However, the waveforms demonstrate essentially
no significant
diastolic flow. This is an abnormal finding, and can be seen
with ATN among
other etiologies. Renal veins are not well visualized.


Final Report
RENAL ULTRASOUND WITH DOPPLER, [**2148-12-6**]

INDICATION: Renal failure.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: Right kidney measures 11.8 cm in length. Left kidney
measures 12.9
cm in length.

There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection.

Doppler evaluation is substantially limited due to portable
technique and the
patient's inability to breathhold. Allowing for this limitation,
arterial
flow is noted within the right and left renal arteries.
Waveforms are
abnormal, with essentially no diastolic flow noted. However,
there is a sharp
systolic upstroke.

The renal veins are not well visualized.

Note is made of a simple cyst in the upper pole of the right
kidney measuring
approximately 3.4 x 3.9 x 3.7 cm. There is an additional cyst in
the lower
pole of the left kidney.

Prostate is diffusely enlarged measuring approximately 5.4 x 4.9
x 3.5 cm. The
bladder is not fully distended.

IMPRESSION: Examination limited due to inability to breathhold
as well as
portable technique. However, allowing for this limitation, there
is flow and
sharp systolic upstroke in both renal arteries. However, there
is essentially
no diastolic flow. Differential considerations could include ATN
among other
etiologies. Clinical correlation suggested.



The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  55%  >= 55%
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  2.4 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Large
vegetation on aortic valve. Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: No mass or vegetation on mitral valve. Mild to
moderate ([**12-20**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve. Physiologic TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was monitored by a nurse
in [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. Local anesthesia was
provided by benzocaine topical spray. The patient was sedated
for the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information section). No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) mobile atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta to 42 cm from the incisors and simple plaque in the
transverse arch . The 3 aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a large ((1.9x0.5cm) vegetation on the
non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen without evidence of leaflet perforation or
root abscess development. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
to moderately thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
PICC line tip is visualized within the right atrium. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Impresssion: Large 1.9x0.5cm mobile vegetation is seen on the
