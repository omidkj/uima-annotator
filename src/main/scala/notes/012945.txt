58M with large liver mass found on ultrasound and a posterior

Post-operative head CT:
The patient is status post left posterior parietal craniectomy
and excision of previously described enhancing lesion in the
left parietal lobe. There is a small amount of postoperative
pneumocephalus and a minimal postoperative hemorrhage at the
surgical bed. There is no significant mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures. Small pneumocephalus is also
present along the left frontal lobe. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The osseous structures are
otherwise unremarkable. Visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.
IMPRESSION: Anticipated postoperative pneumocephalus and minimal
hemorrhage at the post-left parietal craniectomy surgical bed.

Preop MRI: There is an enhancing lesion within the left
posterior parietal lobe. This study is severely degraded due to
large amounts of patient motion artifact. The mass measures
approximately 3.8 x 2.6 cm. It appears slightly more prominent
than on a prior examination and may be due to technical factors.
No additional enhancing lesions are noted.
IMPRESSION: Limited due to patient motion artifact. There is an
enhancing lesion within the posterior left parietal lobe.

Postop MRI: Since the previous MRI examination, there has been
resection of a small left parietal enhancing lesion presumed to
be metastasis. A small amount of blood products are seen in this
region with air in the postsurgical bed as well as in the
frontal region indicative of pneumocephalus. Following
gadolinium, subtle area of enhancement is identified on the
medial aspect and along the deeper portion of the surgical bed
and blood products. There is no change in edema seen. No acute
infarct is identified. No midline shift or hydrocephalus seen.
Small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the left frontal white matter
are unchanged and indicate mild changes of small vessel disease.
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of left parietal enhancing
mass. Subtle residual enhancement is seen at the deeper portion
of the surgical cavity and along the medial aspect.
Pneumocephalus and postoperative blood products are seen. No
evidence of hydrocephalus or acute infarct.

Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old male s/p craniotomy for left parietal glioblastoma
resection. He has liver cancer and recently had a perforation of
the sigmoid colon, which resulted in a colostomy placement on
[**2117-9-14**].

He was admitted on [**2117-10-15**] for his surgery, which went well
with no complications.
He stayed in the PACU overnight and was transferred to the floor
on [**2117-10-16**]. He continued to do well on the floor.
Postoperatively, his diet was advanced and his IVF discontinued.
His antiepileptic medications were continued. He was treated
with decadrona and discharged with a taper to 2mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was
neurologically stable and ambulating well on discharge.
