This discharge summary covers the dates [**2101-5-18**] to [**2101-5-30**].
The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course will be
dictated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 64-year-old with
multiple medical problems including his ST segment elevation
MI in [**2101-2-28**] status post stent to his LAD x2, stents
to the left circumflex and RCA, CHF with an EF of 20-25
percent, type 2 diabetes, history of TIA/CVA, status post
AICD placement, also with a history of Afib/A flutter/NSVT,
with recent CCU admission [**4-29**] through [**2101-5-8**] for pacer
interrogation and tailored diuresis and inotropic support.

Patient now presents with episodes of AICD firing x2.  One
episode was the evening before admission.  The other episode
was four days prior.  Also associated with syncope and
lightheadedness.  The patient denies any chest pain,
shortness of breath, urinary or bowel incontinence during the
episodes.  He states that the syncope must have lasted
minutes.  He was then told to come to the Emergency Room by
the [**Hospital **] Clinic.

While in the Emergency Room Waiting Room, he developed [**6-9**]
substernal chest pain radiating to his back without radiation
to arms or jaw.  No nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.  He was
given three sublingual nitroglycerins, 2.5 mg of IV Lopressor
x4, amiodarone 400 mg p.o. x1, and K-Dur 40 for a low K.  He
was also noted to be in Afib/flutter.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 325 q.d.
2. Plavix 75 q.d.
3. Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
7. Coreg 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
10.      Lente 28 units q.a.m. along with Humalog sliding
   scale.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was seen by EP and given a
5 joules shock from his pacemaker in an attempt
cardioversion, however, this failed.  Of note, the two shocks
that the patient received outside the hospital are both
appropriate as he had runs of VT.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post ST
segment elevation MI in [**2101-2-28**] with two stents to the
LAD, one to the circumflex, and one to the RCA.

CHF with an EF of 20-25 percent.

Type 2 diabetes.

Hypertension.

History of diverticulosis.

History of gastritis.

History of TIA/CVA.

History of Afib/flutter.

ICD placement in [**4-3**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.1, blood pressure
88/61, heart rate of 128 and noted to be in A. flutter,
saturating 97 percent on 2 liters.  On exam, pertinent
findings:  His jugular venous pressure is at 7 cm.  His heart
was regular, rate, and rhythm with occasional premature
beats.  His chest had decreased breath sounds at the right
base, but was otherwise clear.  He had no peripheral edema.

EKG showed A-flutter at 138 beats per minute with 2:1
conduction, normal axis and intervals.  There were [**Street Address(2) 55320**] elevations in V2 and V4 and 2 mm ST segment
elevation in V2.  These were not significantly changed from
[**2101-5-2**].  Subsequently at 20:43, the patient converted
back to sinus rhythm with subtle T-wave inversions in I and
L, which were unchanged from prior.  He was also noted to
have poor R-wave progression.

First set of cardiac enzymes were negative.  Laboratory data
was remarkable for an INR of 1.6.  A K during admission was
3.1.  As noted, the patient reported chest pain that radiated
to his back.  He got a CT angiogram in the Emergency Room to
rule out for dissection, which was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac.  On [**2101-5-19**], the patient underwent an EP study
   for A-flutter ablation.  His ICD was also upgraded to a
   dual-chamber pacemaker.  After the procedure, the patient
   developed hypotension requiring dopamine and was
   complaining of lightheadedness.  Around this time, the
   patient also started to develop worsening pulmonary edema.

In terms of his hypotension, his dopamine drip was initially
continued.  His Coreg was decreased from 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
to 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.  His lisinopril and Aldactone were
initially stopped.  Milrinone was added in the hope of
increasing forward flow to help with diuresis.

Also post procedure, the patient was noted to be A-paced
appropriately and amiodarone was continued.  He was therefore
found to be in cardiogenic shock physiology and was stable on
Vasopressin as well as the milrinone.

In terms of his ischemia, he was continued on aspirin,
Lipitor, and Plavix.  For rhythm wise, he was continued on
amiodarone.  On [**2101-5-24**], the Vasopressin was weaned off.
He was also at this time given prn doses of Lasix to help
with diuresis.  On [**2101-5-24**], the patient also received 2
units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 27.1.  In
the morning of [**2101-5-25**], the patient woke up with the
insidious onset of [**6-9**] epigastric sharp pain with radiation
to his back.  Patient also reported occasional shortness of
breath, but not necessarily related to his epigastric pain.
There was no substernal chest pain, no nausea, vomiting, or
diaphoresis.  His jugular venous pressure was at his jaw at
the time and there were decreased breath sounds halfway up
with associated crackles.  Also at this time, he was noted to
have mild epigastric pain with guaiac negative brown stool.

It was thought that his chest pain was actually pleuritic in
nature.  He had a chest x-ray which showed large bilateral
pleural effusions.  He was continued on IV Lasix prn to help
with diuresis.  An abdominal CT was also ordered at this time
to rule out a retroperitoneal hematoma given his recent EP
procedure and drop in hematocrit.  This was negative.

Also at this time, in terms of the CHF exacerbation, he was
continued on captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d., but this was held
prn for hypertension.  The Advanced Heart Failure team
evaluated the patient on [**2101-5-26**] for possible transplant.
Numerous hepatitis laboratories as well as HIV, toxo, CMV,
EBV, varicella, and herpes serologies were ordered.  These
are still pending at the time of dictation.

On [**2101-5-28**], some of the patient's serologies had returned.
His varicella zoster was IgG positive.  His CMV was IgG
positive, IgM negative.  His EBV panel was pending at this
time.  His toxo IgG was positive, IgM was negative.  His T3
and T4 were normal.  He had a negative hepatitis A antibody.
His PSA was 0.7.  A HIV test was negative.  Carotid
ultrasound was also performed at this time and showed no
stenosis bilaterally.

Throughout the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, he
received prn doses of Lasix to help with diuresis and also
was continued on milrinone to help forward flow.  He diuresced
well and felt better at the 0.5 mg/kg/min dose but due to
increased NSVT the milrinone was decreased back to the lower dose
of 0.375 mg/kg/min.  On [**2101-5-28**], the patient was tried on Bumex
with poor results in terms of his urine output and then was
changed back to Lasix and metolazone.  The metolazone was stopped
because the patient was becoming hypochloremic.

On [**2101-5-30**], the patient was started on 1.5 liter fluid
restriction and his Zaroxolyn was D/C'd.

Type 2 diabetes.  He was continued on sliding scale insulin
and Lente.  The patient had a couple episodes of a.m.
hypoglycemia and his lente was changed to 38 units q.a.m., 18
units q.p.m.

In terms of prophylaxis, he was continued on Protonix.  He
was also continued on Coumadin for both history of Afib and a
dyskinetic apex.
