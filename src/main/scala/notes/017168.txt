CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old woman with
a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis, Evans'
syndrome, endocarditis, status post aortic valve replacement,
mitral valve and tricuspid repair, and a recent history of
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection after
lymphocele drainage who presents from [**Hospital3 2558**] with a
fever of 104 and hypotension.

The patient has a history of endocarditis in [**2196-1-25**],
status post aortic valve replacement and repair of her mitral
and tricuspid valves with an echocardiogram with an ejection
fraction of 55%, and 4+ tricuspid regurgitation.  Her
recovery from this endocarditis and surgery was complicated
by a left-sided cerebrovascular accident in [**2196-1-25**].
She has a history of chronic atrial fibrillation, but had
been off of warfarin.  The patient was home for a period of
one month or two after rehabilitation from this surgery when
she returned to [**Hospital6 1708**] where she
received all of her care for drainage of bilateral groin
lymphoceles which were found to be infected with
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus, and
corynebacterium.  She began a prolonged course of vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and Flagyl and was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**]
on [**2196-10-17**] on a course of linezolid and
vancomycin.  During this hospitalization at [**Hospital6 8866**] she also was noted to have bilateral pleural
effusions (right greater than left) which were drained, and
were culture negative, and found to be transudative.  This
hospital course was also complicated by a splenic infarct and
a paraspinous hematoma.

Today, the patient was noted to have a temperature of 101.
She had developed nausea and vomiting that was
guaiac-positive last night at [**Hospital3 2558**].  She was sent
to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department because [**Hospital6 1708**] was on
diversion.  She was noted to be hypotensive with a blood
pressure in the 70s in the Emergency Department and received
3 liters of normal saline with an increase in her systolic
blood pressure to the 90s.  She was given levofloxacin and
Flagyl and stress dose steroids.  She was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for management of sepsis as well as
monitoring for gastrointestinal bleed and was noted to have a
heme-positive rectal examination and decreased platelet count
in the Emergency Department.  An OG was placed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Evans' syndrome, chronically on steroids (prednisone 20
mg p.o. q.d.) and transfused with a hematocrit of less than
24.
2.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Aortic valve replacement, mitral and tricuspid repair.
6.  Endocarditis in [**2196-1-25**].
7.  Cerebrovascular accident in [**2196-1-25**].
8.  History of endometrial cancer, status post total
abdominal hysterectomy.
9.  Status post lymphocele drainage and sclerosis with
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus
cultures positive.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Compazine 10 mg p.o. q.d.,
Prilosec 40 mg p.o. q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., Milk of
Magnesia, Celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d., Dulcolax, MS Contin 15 mg
p.o. q.d., folate 1 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.,
atenolol 37.5 mg p.o. q.d., Ativan p.r.n., danazol 400 mg
p.o. b.i.d., trazodone 25 mg p.o. q.d., Atrovent,
prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.d., multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, SULFA, and AZTREONAM.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature of 103, pulse 110, blood
pressure 90/40, respiratory rate 30, pulse oximetry 96% on
room air.  In general, this was a chronically ill-appearing,
diaphoretic, pale female.  Pupils were equally round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Sclerae were anicteric.
Ecchymoses over the right eye.  The oropharynx was clear.
Dry mucous membranes.  The neck was supple.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular was tachycardic,
irregularly irregular, with first heart sound and second
heart sound.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left
upper sternal border.  Abdomen was soft and nondistended,
mild right upper quadrant tenderness.  No rebound or
guarding.  Rectal was heme-positive.  Extremities revealed 1+
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Right inguinal lymphocele
with dressing, left inguinal lymphocele with dressing.  Alert
and oriented times three.  Neurologically, the patient had
slurred speech.  Strength revealed right upper extremity was
[**4-28**], left upper extremity 4+/5.  Sensation was intact to
light touch.  Gait not assessed.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count 14.2 (with
75 neutrophils, 15 bands, 7 lymphocytes), hematocrit 29,
platelets of 75.  Urinalysis was notable for a large amount
of blood, positive nitrites, 30 protein, 236 red blood cells,
22 white blood cells.  Chem-7 notable for a potassium of 2.9,
bicarbonate of 28.  ALT 74, alkaline phosphatase 85, total
bilirubin 1.4, CK of 7.  PT 15.6, PTT 33.9.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed atrial
fibrillation, a right bundle-branch block, left axis
deviation, rate 112, T wave inversions in leads II and aVL.

Chest x-ray with pleural effusion on the right with a
question of a right infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had blood cultures grow
4/4 bottles positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus and was treated from the date of admission with
vancomycin and gentamicin for one week.  She continued to
have low-grade fevers throughout the course of her admission
until the day of discharge.

A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which
demonstrated no overt vegetations and was compared with prior
transesophageal echocardiogram [**Hospital6 1708**].
No changes were noted.  Stool culture and urine cultures were
all negative as well as surveillance cultures on this
patient.  However, given the patient's history of valve
repair and recent treatment times one month for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after lymphocele
drainage with recurrence of bacteremia and sepsis, the
patient will continue on a long-term course of antibiotics
for at least six weeks.  Infectious Disease was consulted and
recommended vancomycin 1 g q.12h. intravenously,
rifampin 300 mg p.o. q.8h. (both times six weeks), plus
gentamicin 80 mg intravenously q.8h. times one additional
week after the week she received in house.  The patient was
to follow up with her outpatient physicians at [**Hospital6 8866**] for further workup of infection and
endocarditis.  The patient maintained her blood pressure and
her oxygen saturations throughout the course of her admission
after initial presentation.

2.  PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have a right pleural
effusion with loculation.  Her pleural effusion had received
thoracentesis at [**Hospital6 1708**] and was found
to be transudative.  Given her good oxygen saturations on
room air, the decision was made to not intervene at this
point.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION/INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was to
return to [**Hospital3 2558**] and was to follow up with her
[**Hospital6 1708**] physicians as an outpatient with
the antibiotic course as listed above.  No change was made in
the rest of her medications.  From a rheumatologic and
cardiovascular standpoint, the patient was stable throughout
the rest of this admission.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.
2.  Hypotension.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.
