History of Present Illness:
This 64 year old male has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy
with an EF of [**9-3**]%. He is s/p CABG in [**2086**] with SVG to PLA,
LIMA to LAD. He was evaluated for a biventricular ICD at [**Hospital1 **] in [**2098**], but did not qualify at that time, based on
his QRS duration and tissue Doppler imaging. He has been
medically managed since then.
.
He has a h/o ?COPD and c/o cough productive of clear sputum, and
worsening wheezing and SOB. He thought he had the flu but denies
fevers, chills, HA, myalgia, or night sweats. He reports stable
2-pillow orthopnea, denies PND. He was treated presumptively for
?bronchitis vs PNA? with a week-long course of azithromycin
without improvement. He also reports eating almost nothing in
the past 2 weeks and drinking very little. He has been compliant
with all meds including diuretics. He denies chest pain and
endorses light headedness only with coughing. He has felt his
ICD go into ATP but denies any shocks.
.
This AM he presented to [**Hospital6 **] for this
worsened shortness of breath where his VSS were 112/70 P 95 rr20
92% on RA. He was given levoquin 750, CTX, albuterol. He was
found to have intermittent SVT that was terminated by ATP. He
was given amiodarone 150mg IV x1 and started on a drip which
decreased the rate of his VT such that his AICD did not fire; he
was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] emergency department.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED given ASA, plavix, nebs, CXR?RML pna? 100mg
lidocaine and drip at 3mg/hr. EP service interrogated his pacer
and found frequent episodes of VT terminated by ATP beginning
[**11-22**]. They changed the thesholds of his AICD and it did
appropriately respond to several more runs of VT. He had
approximately 10 runs SVT that were pace-terminated in the [**Hospital1 18**]
emergency department. He was started on a lidocaine drip at 3mg,
given nebs, bolused 800cc and admitted to the CCU.
.
In the CCU on transfer he felt well other than fatigue and SOB.
He denied CP, nausea, vomiting, myalgias. He was alert and
oriented x 3 and appropriately conversant. His vital signs were
T 97.2 BP 68/44, HR 71, 100% 3L n/c with PE significant for loud
wheezes, mild respiratory distress and neck veins elevated to
ear lobe while sitting up at 45 degrees. He was bolused 250 cc
without improvement in his BP. He was oliguric to about 5-10cc
in his first hour. Over that hour he became progressively
hypotensive with SBP in the 60's-90 range in both arms (mainly
60's'-70's) with HR in the 70's. He was asymptomatic with these
pressures and mentating well. He then began feeling more
fatigued/generally poor with SBPs consistently in the 60's. He
was started on levophed via peripheral IV, and while attempting
arterial placement the patient became apneic and unresponsive.
CPR was initiated for PEA arrest and he was intubated. He
received 3 rounds epi and within about 45 minutes, he regained a
pulse. Bedside echo showed a severely depressed EF and no
pericardial effusion.

Pertinent Results:
[**2102-11-25**] CXR: Mild congestive heart failure has developed with
perihilar haziness, peribronchial cuffing and septal thickening
as well as a small right pleural effusion.
.
[**2102-11-27**] ECHO:  LVEF <20% The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
wtih severe global free wall hypokinesis.The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2102-12-1**] Renal dopplers: IMPRESSION:
1. Left main and intrarenal arteries demonstrate abnormal parvus
waveforms. There is associated cortical thinning of the left
kidney. Findings suggest chronic left renal artery stenosis or
intrinsic renal disease. Conventional or MR angiography of the
renal arteries is recommended for further evaluation.
.
2. Mildly elevated right-sided renal resistive indices.
.
[**2102-12-5**] RUQ U/S:  CONCLUSION: Small volume ascites, small left
effusion, splenomegaly and dilatation of the hepatic veins and
inferior vena cava. Pulsatile nature of portal vein flow is also
noted and the findings are suggestive of right heart failure
with passive hepatic congestion as a possible explanation for
elevated LFTs.
.
Gallbladder sludge also noted, but no evidence of cholecystitis,
cholelithiasis, or bile duct abnormalities.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old man with a history of coronary
artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 10-15%, s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V
ICD, presenting with SOB and found to have multiple episodes of
VT. s/p intubation for respiratory failure and PEA arrest x 2.
.
# hypotension/shock/PEA arrest on admission:  Was likely
cardiogenic shock [**12-22**] extremely low baseline EF (10-15%) +
decompensation from hypovolemia and bradycardia with coronary
hypoperfusion. It was unlikely ACS is underlying etiology given
lack of chest pain, EKG unchanged, negative CE's. and an eccho
that was grossly unchanged. Pt again PEA arrested AM
post-admission (resolved with epi/atropine x2) with telemetry
findings sinus brady rate 54, concerning for failure of LV
capture.  He developed VT developed post arrest which was
associated with normotension and was pace-terminated.
Electrophysiology was consulted who changed his pace-maker's
back-up rate to 70; he subsuquently had no further episodes of
PEA arrest or of hypotension.
.
#) CARDIAC:
a) RHYTHM: Mr [**Known lastname **] presented after having multiple episodes
of VT at home [**2102-11-22**], per interrogation by EP. At an OSH he was
initially managed with amio boluses, causing VT to slow down
which was not recognized by his pacemaker. EP adjusted the
parameters on his pacemaker and then he was managed with
lidocaine gtt. Mr [**Known lastname **] had one witnessed episode of VT upon
coming out of his PEA arrest; this broke with lidocaine drip
(which was stopped shortly thereafter). Other than this, he had
one short episode of VT found on telemetry which was ATP
terminated on teh 2nd cycle.  He was subsuquently started on
amiodarone; he should have q6 month LFTs, thyroid tests; yearly
PFTs and eye exam while on this drug
.
With regards to his [**Hospital1 **]-V pacer; it was theorized that his BP was
unable to tolerate bradycardia and his back-up ventricular rate
was increased rate to 70. He had no other hypotensive episodes
after this change.
.
b) PUMP: severe, ischemic cardiomyopathy. EF likely
