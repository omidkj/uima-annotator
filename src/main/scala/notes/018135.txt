Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] to have her external biliary
drain internalized by interventional radiology.
Post-operatively, upon arrival to PACU, the patient developed
respiratory distress with HTN/tachycardia. She was given lasix
10mg IV and labetalol 10mg IV x2. Placed on BiPAP for 45 minutes
with clinical improvement. Admitted to TSICU on 4LNC,
hemodynamically stable for overnight monitoring of CHF
exacerbation likely in setting of hyperdynamic response post-op.


[**2124-6-14**] & [**2124-6-15**]: Pt's respiratory condition improved after
diuresis in the PACU and SICU. Her oxygen requirements decreased
from BIPAP to NC once lasix was given. Her cardiac markers were
negative and a formal echo done showed mild aortic stenosis. The
cardiology service saw the patient and reported that her
pulmonary
edema may have been due to diastolic dysfunction in the setting
of hypertension and tachycardia. A formal echo done on [**6-15**]
confirmed the presence of mild aortic stenosis. The pt was
transfered from the the ICU to the from on HD 2 and IR attempted
to cap the two externalized biliary drains in the patient.
Fluoroscopic analysis of the pt's two stents revealed that both
stents were clogged. IR placed dilated the two stents and placed
two longer stents over the original stents. These were left
draining on HD 2 with the plan of clamping them for 24 hrs and
if no complications developed sending the pt home on HD 3. The
right drain had moderate output and was clamped on HD 2. The
left drain was not clamped until HD 3 [**1-25**] high ss fluid output.

[**2124-6-16**]: Pt underwent another cholangiogram by IR and it was
then decided to leave both drains clamped

[**2124-6-17**]: LFTs were found to be stable on HD 4 w/ no e/o biliary
obstruction after clamping the tube o/n. Both drains were left
clamped during HD 4 and the patient tolerated a regular diet and
did not develop constitutional sx's. The drains will be left for
7-10 days to ensure patency of her biliary tree and then removed
by IR as an outpatient. Pt was kept in place for 7-10 days to
ensure patency and remove it as an outpatient.

Pt developed hyponatremia on HD4 to 124. She was given salt tabs
and continued her regular diet and by evening her Na had risen
to 128.

[**2124-6-18**]: Pt's Na remained stable on HD5 and she was discharged
to home w/ Na suppl and f/u to PCP in good condition.
