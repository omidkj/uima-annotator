Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoglycemia, Hypercarbia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
54 yo male with morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, Afib, OSA, on home O2 who presented from nursing home
with hypoglycemia.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**7-17**] to [**7-19**] with hypoxia to 80's.
 At that time he had an elevated d-dimer but couldn't undergo
CT.  Ultimately it was felt that PE was less likely as he had
negative LENIs and TTE without TR or RV strain.  Reportedly this
was his 3rd admission in 3 weeks and he was discharged to rehab.
 At rehab he is on insulin, which they have been titrating down
at the nursing home.  Today he was found to have BS 78, given OJ
and snacks, recheck was 24 and given glucagon and sent to the
ED.

Relevant studies:
TTE ([**2182-8-28**])- The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Very poor quality study. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is probably low normal, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be excluded. The right ventricle was not well
seen. No significant valvular abnormalities. Estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal (possibly underestimated as
it was calculated without addition of RA pressure).

Lower extremity doppler ultrasound ([**2182-8-27**])- FINDINGS:
Examination is extremely limited due to patient's body habitus.
Limited evaluation of the right popliteal vein demonstrates no
conclusive evidence of thrombus; however, compression views were
not able to be obtained. The left lower extremity was not
attempted as the study was then canceled by the ordering
physician.
  [**Name Initial (NameIs) 96516**]: Nondiagnostic study of the right lower extremity
due to patient's body habitus. Left lower extremity was not
evaluated.

EEG ([**2182-9-1**])- IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG
because of a slow and disorganized background of [**4-12**] Hz with
bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing indicative of a
moderate encephalopathy which is
etiologically non-specific. Of note, the EKG showed an irregular

rhythm, concerning for possible atrial flutter. A standard
12-lead EKG
may be helpful for further evaluation.

CT head non contrast ([**2182-9-20**])- FINDINGS: There is no evidence
of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of normally
midline structures or vascular territorial infarct. The imaged
portions of the mastoid air cells are partially aerated. There
is diffuse opacification of the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses
as well as hyperdensities within the maxillary sinus consistent
with insipated secretions.  The imaged soft tissues and osseous
structures are unremarkable.
  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process

CXR ([**2182-9-20**])- FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest was
obtained. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. Low lung volumes
account for apparent increase in bilateral heterogeneous lung
opacities. Moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. Left pleural
effusion is small and unchanged. No pneumothorax.  Right PICC is
traced to the low SVC, after which the tip is obscured.
  IMPRESSION:
  1. Right PICC traced to the mid SVC, after which the tip is
obscured.
  2. Low lung volumes with unchanged moderate pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo male with morbid obesity with obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, Afib, OSA, on home O2 who presented from nursing home
with hypoglycemia, increasing hypercarbia and hypoxia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: initial ABG c/w
mixed acute and chronic respiratory acidosis, likely due to
known obesity hypoventilation syndrome with acute worsening due
to altered mental status from hypoglycemia, underlying PNA, and
pulmonary edema.  His sats were initially maintained with nasal
canula and intermittent facemask (would not tolerate CPAP or
BiPAP), however on hospital day 3 he had worsening respiratory
status with increasing hypercarbia, necessitating inbutation.  A
pulmonary embolism was considered a possible etiology for his
clinical deterioration, so LENIs were non-diagnostic due to his
body habitus and CTA or VQ scan were unable to be obtained for
the same reason. Clinical suspicion for PE was initially high,
so heparin gtt was started empirically ([**8-25**] - [**9-14**]), but
eventually discontinued on  due to nasal bleeding, hematuria,
and decreased clinical suscpicion. Bronchoalveolar lavage
findings were consistent with left lower/middle pneumonia and
the patient was started on vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/cipro (details below).
Patient appeared severely volume overloaded and diuresis with
Lasix gtt was initiated. TBB was negative 16L, which led to
decreased ventilator depende
