Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Claudication

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. PTA/stenting of the left external iliac artery

History of Present Illness:
69 year old man has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
chronic renal insuffiency, heavy former tobacco abuse and COPD.
Over the past year he has been bothered by left upper thigh, hip
and buttocks discomfort after walking about 100 feet. This
resolves with rest. He denies any non healing ulcers. The right
leg becomes fatigued with walking. Recent MRI has revealed a
high grade left external iliac artery stenosis and he is now
being referred for angiography and revascularization.
.
Of note, the patient has a fair amount of dyspnea with limited
exertion.  Non invasive cardiac testing has been unremarkable.
It
is felt that his dyspnea is due to COPD.
.
left external iliac stent placed by Dow yesterday with right
groin access.  hematoma after procedure - stable, but had
ultrasound this morning, found femoral pseudoaneurysm.  1 hour
later, popping sensation, swelling of right groin and scrotal
hematoma, systolics 60's, back to bed, volume resuscitation 1L,
1unit of blood.  presyncopal per patient, no LOC.  vascular
called and transferred to CCU.  will watch for repair:  vascular
recs: pulse checks - all palpable, systolic checks
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,

Peripheral Catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited peripheral angiography demonstrated a no plaquing in
the
abdominal aorta. The right lower extremity had a 40% stenosis in
the
right external iliac with no flow limiting disease downstream.
The left
lower extremity had a 90% stenosis in the external iliac artery
with no
flow limiting disease downstream and preserved three vessl
runoff.
2. Successful stenting of the left EIA with an 8x40mm ZILVER
self
expanding stent which was postdilated with a 7mm SUBMARINE
balloon at 4
ATMs.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic
pressure of
158/78 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Peripheral arterial disease.
2. Successful stenting of the left EIA.
3. Moderately elevated systolic hypertension.
.
US [**2123-10-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm in the right inguinal region. A
2.8 cm
hematoma is noted in the high right inguinal region and might
represent the thrombosed remnant of the previously seen
pseudoaneurysm.
2. Deep venous thrombosis of the right common femoral and deep
femoral veins.
3. No deep venous thrombosis in left lower extremity.




Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old man with a left external iliac artery stenosis and
claudication s/p stenting [**2123-10-11**] c/b R groin/scrotal
hematoma
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Hematoma: A psuedoanuerysm in the right groin was noted the day
after his procedure on US. He later coughed, felt a popping
sensation, and became hypotensive and presyncopal. He was given
IVF and 2uPRBC and a FemStop clamp was placed. He he was then
remained hemodynamically stable. The following day an ultrasound
showed no pseudoaneurysm but did show a DVT.
.
#DVT: Provoked in the setting of FemStop clamp decreasing venous
return. He was given lovenox to bridge him to therapeutic
anticoagulation with warfarin. The plan is to continue his
anticoagulation for THREE months and then repeat an ultrasound.
He was discharged on 5mg warfarin. This will likely need to be
adjusted as an outpatient.
.
#PAD: He underwent succesful stenting of his left external iliac
artery through right femoral artery access complicated by R
Groin hematoma as above. He was discharged on aspirin, plavix,
atorvastatin, as well as lovenox and warfgarin as above.
.
#Hypertension: Home HTN regmen was Dilt (also for A-FIB) and
clonidine. During this admission we started Carvedilol 25 mg PO
BID, lisinopril 20 mg, Torsemide 10mg daily and started tapering
off clonidine. Torsemide was chosen instead of a thiazide
diuretic because of his low GFR. His blood pressures were well
controlled with this regimen. He was discharged on clonidine 0.1
mg [**Hospital1 **] with the plan to stop this 2 days after discharge. He may
need further uptitration of his lisinopril if his blood pressure
increases after clonidine is discontinued.
.
#COPD: Not on inhalers or oxygen at home. He did have some mild
shortness of breath so ipratropium inhaler was started. He did
not endorse much benefit from the inhaler. Further management
can be considered as an outpatient.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
.
#CKD: Creatinie was at his baseline throughout admission and did
not increase after starting lisinopril and torsemide.
.
#GERD: Continue home omeprazole
.
#Gout: Reduced allopurinol dose to 150 mg because of lower
creatinine clearance
.
#BPH: Continued doxazosin
.
#Anemia: Unclear etiology. [**Month (only) 116**] be related to CKD or prior ETOH
use. Does not appear to be iron deficient.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Anemia: Perhaps chronic but of unclear etiology. Wo
