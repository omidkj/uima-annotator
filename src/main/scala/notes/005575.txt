[**2108-8-1**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had an 80% stenosis
in the distal portion of the vessel. The LAD had a 80% proximal
stenosis, a 70 mid vessel stenosis and a 80% distal vessel
stenosis. The Cx had a 70% stenosis in the proximal portion of
the vessel. The RCA had an 80% stenosis in the distal portion of
the vessel and there was diffuse plaquing all throughout the
RCA. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics reveal elevated left sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 20 mmHg. There was no
transaortic valve gradient on pullback from the LV to the aorta.
The central aortic pressure was 153/85 mmHg.
[**2108-8-2**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad. IMPRESSION: Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Mild diastolic LV dysfunction.
No significant valvular disease seen
[**2108-8-2**] Chest CT Scan:
In the left lobe of the thyroid, a 2.5 cm nodule is seen. This
nodule should be further worked up with ultrasonography.
Otherwise, there are no abnormalities in the upper mediastinum.
Generally, in the mediastinum, no enlarged lymph nodes are seen.
Extensive coronary calcifications. There is no evidence of
pleural effusions or other pleural pathology. In the lung
parenchyma, in the right apex (3, 9), a 3-4 mm nodule is seen.
Otherwise, there is no evidence of nodular lung lesions, notably
no evidence of lesions suspicious for metastasis. The airways
are patent. No evidence for airway lesions. At the left lateral
margin of the spleen (2, 58) a small calcification is seen.
Small gallbladder stone (2, 62). 2-mm right renal calculus (2,
68). The bone windows show moderate degenerative
vertebraldisease, but no evidence of bone destruction.
[**2108-8-3**] Carotid Ultrasound:
There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow. There is
antegrade left vertebral artery flow. Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which revealed severe three vessel coronary artery including
left main lesion - see result section for further details.
Cardiac surgery was consulted and further preoperative
evaluation was performed. This was highlighted by an
echocardiogram, chest CT scan and carotid ultrasound - see
result section for additional details. The echocardiogram showed
only mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global biventricular systolic function, mild diastolic LV
dysfunction, and no significant valvular disease. Carotid
ultrasound showed minimal disease of both internal carotid
arteries. Chest CT scan revealed a thyroid nodule and right
upper lobe nodule, but there was no evidence of lesions
suspicious for metastasis. He remained pain free on medical
therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery. On [**8-7**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery. Please see operative note for details.

Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated without incident. He maintained stable
hemodynamics and weaned from pressor support without difficulty.
On postoperative day one, he transferred to postop floor to
begin increasing his activity level. Chest tubes and pacing
wires removed per protocol. His calcium channel blockers were
uptitrated (beta blockade was not started as her is allergic to
this class of drugs). He was started on Kefzol for
serosanguinous sternal drainage without erythema or a sternal
click. He was cleared for discharge to home on POD #5 with ten
days of Keflex and strict sternal precautions.  His lantus dose
was increased to 45 units at bedtime in response to elevated
blood sugars and an admission Hemoglobin A1C of 8.1.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has recommended to Mr. [**Known lastname **] and his urologist
that he not undergo his renal mass surgery for six weeks after
his bypass surgery. He was requested to make all followup appts
as per discharge instructions.
