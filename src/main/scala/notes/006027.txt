History of Present Illness:
62 year old woman with history of DM II, CAD s/p stent and MI,
HTN, hypercholesterolemia, prior R MCA infarct with residual
blindness, who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**9-2**] to [**9-10**]
after she presented to the ED with fall and coffee ground
emesis. She was found to be in DKA felt to be possibly due to
UTI with pansensitive E. Coli, for which she was to complete 7d
course of cipro. She also developed UGIB and was found to have
candidal esophagitis on EGD and was started on fluconazole
treatment. She also had ST elevations in inferior leads on that
admission but ruled out for MI with enzymes. She was discharged
home on [**9-10**] (lives alone). Two days later, on [**9-12**] VNA found
her disheveled in bed, not having eaten for 2 days, concern that
apartment may have been broken into. Per notes, she normally is
able to pivot from bed to wheelchair, which was next to her bed,
but this time felt too weak and fatigued to do so, and also
couldn't see where her chair or phone was. In ER, FSBG 242, U/A
w/ 1000 glu, tr ketones, no acidosis/AG by chem 7. She was
re-admitted to the medicine service for further workup of
failure to thrive, safety at home.

On this admission, she said that her vision was blurry but
apparently
had this complaint before. Then she developed of a headache,
thought to be migraine. She had a head CT on [**9-13**] that revealed
new hypodensity in the right parieto-occipital region. Neurology
was consulted and an MRI showed multiple bilateral occipital
infarct. The work up for embolic source was initiated (carotid
US pending, TEE was recommended).

She was doing well on the floor, satting high 90's on RA - 2L NC
until 1am [**2195-9-16**]. Vitals at MN revealed T 98.9; 140/70; 75;
18; 93% on 2L. Shortly thereafter, the patient complained of
medications and when she returned about 15 minutes later, she
found the patient in respiratory distress. O2 sat 62% on RA. The
patient was placed on 5L NC and given Albuterol nebulizer for
audible wheezing. Then placed on 100% NRB (satting 90% on NRB;
ABG 7.36/58/60; lactate 1.0 on a NRB). Received Lasix 40 mg IV
once with good response. EKG done and showed no ischemic
changes. CXR showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema (new from
[**2195-9-13**]).  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was diuresed successfully. She had
a repeat MRI/MRA. Neuro continued to follow for her posterior
embolic strokes and recommend avoiding hypo/hypertension, good
glycemic control.  She was also ruled out for MI with CEs (neg
CKs, flat tnts). TEE ruled out vegetation/other abnormality or
embolic source.

CT SINUS/ORBIT: IMPRESSION:

1. Normal-appearing orbits bilaterally, without periorbital
edema, soft tissue stranding, or collection.

2. Stable near complete opacification of the left maxillary
sinus, with hyperdense and minimally enhancing material. While
these could represent chronic inspissated secretions, fungal
sinusitis cannot be excluded, and clinical correlation is
requested.

3. Bilateral occipital lobe hypodensities, unchanged.

4. Right thyroid nodule.

TEE: Conclusions:
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Inferior hypokinesis is
present.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is a small pericardial effusion.
5. No cardiac source of embolism seen.
6. Compared to the previous study of [**2195-9-22**], there is no
significant
change.

CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:

1) No intracranial hemorrhage. Stable multiple low-density
lesions within both parieto-occipital lobes, are stable from the
prior examination but new from the examination of [**2195-9-6**]. Further evaluation with MRI should be performed.

2) Chronic sinusitis of the left maxillary sinus versus fungal
sinusitis.

ECHO (TTE) Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the
inferior wall. The remaining segments contract well. Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial
effusion. There are bilateral pleural effusions

MRA BRAIN: IMPRESSION:

Acute infarcts in bilateral PCA distribution.

Filling defects in bilateral PCA, left MCA, likely due to
embolic phenomena. These findings were discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2195-9-17**] at 5:41 p.m.

MRI BRAIN: IMPRESSION: Multiple T2 hyperintense areas of slow
diffusion involving both cerebral hemispheres, likely within the
PCA distribution, consistent with embolic infarcts. Further
evaluation with MRA of the head and neck is recommended.

CAROTID DUPLEX: FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of
both carotid arteries. Minimal plaques identified.

On the right, peak systolic velocities are 74, 63, 80 in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent with no
stenosis.

On the left, peak systolic velocities are 87, 73, 76 in the ICA,
CCA, and ECA respectively. This is consistent with no stenosis.

There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of stenosis in either carotid artery.
