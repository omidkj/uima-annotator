History of Present Illness:
62 y.o. male who was well and eating dinner at his home. He
finished eating, brought his dish to the kitchen, and suddenly
had shortness of breath, and motioned to his family. He was pale
and cool but remained conscious. EMS was called and found the
patient diaphoretic and unresponsive sitting in chair. While in
ambulance, he had tonic clonic motions which were felt
consistent with possible seizure activity. After arrival to [**Hospital **], he desatted to the mid-80s and was intubated.
The intubation was difficult [**1-10**] to his ankylosing spondylitis.
He received lidocaine 100mg IV, Vecuronium 1mg IV, Etomidate
100mg IV, and Fentanyl 100mcg. At the OSH there was concern for
PE but due to an iodine dye allergy a CTA chest could not be
performed, but a CT chest w/o contrast was done which was
unremarkable. He also had a CT head which was negative. He was
sent by helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**] for further treatment.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt was intubated on 100% FIO2. His
initial BP was 150s systolic, HR 110s, and 90% O2 sat. He was
suctioned and came up to mid 90s. Exam notable for sluggish but
reactive pupils (1.5--> 1.0 mm) and pt moving all extremities
prior to sedation. His labs are below and notable for WBC of 17,
lactate as high as 6.8 and blood ph of 7.09 on admission. He had
a repeat CT head which was unremarkable. A chest x-ray showed
pulm edema, no effusion, and a retrocardiac opacity. He was
given vanco 1gm/ceftriaxone 2gm for ? pneumonia, either CAP or
aspiration. He had a bedside echo which showed a pericardial
effusion, and cardiology was called who repeated the echo at the
bedside, and felt the effusion to be small and not likely new.
.
During his ED course, his BP dropped to 80s systolic, and he was
given 2L NS and started on dopamine gtt. Right IJ attempted but
line looked to be in carotid artery on CXR. This line was
removed and R femoral line placed instead. He vomited several
times and needed suctioning. His urine tox screen was positive
for opiates and amphetamines.
.
ROS: Family states he had some chest congestion the day prior to
admission. He has a chronic smoker's cough which in unchanged.
Denies fever or chills but pt not likely to have complained of
these things.

STUDIES:
.
[**2132-12-7**] CXR (portable) - Increased interstitial marking of
pulmonary edema.
.
[**2132-12-7**] CT head - 1. No acute intracranial pathology including
no intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Old encephalomalacic changes of the posterior portion of left
occipital lobe as described.
.
[**2132-12-8**] Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound: No
evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the right or left lower
extremity.
.
[**2132-12-10**] ECHO - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25-30 %) with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the
inferior wall., distal LV and apex. The basal lateral wall moves
best. An aortic dissection is not seen but cannot be excluded on
the basis of this study (TEE or CT recommended). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2132-12-11**] CTA -
1. No evidence for dissection or aortic pathology.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis with new
ground-glass opacities near the lung apices, which may relate to
fluid overload, or multifocal areas of pneumonitis. Developing
pneumonia is a consideration.
3. Two small right sided pulmonary nodules as described, follow
up in 6 months advised, although these are likely representative
of loculated fluid.
.
[**2132-12-16**] CXR (PA and lateral) - ICD leads in appropriate position
without pneumothorax. There is no pulmonary congestion.
.
[**2132-12-18**] Cardiac catheterization:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

revealed two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
signficant
disease.  The LAD was totally occluded just after a high
diagonal.  The
LCx had no flow limiting disease.  The RCA had diffuse mid
vessel
disease with a 50-60% stenosis in large vessel.  The MLD of the
RCA was
large (2mm).
2.  Central aortic pressure was normal at 116/67.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease
.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old man with history of diabetes, coronary artery
disease, systolic congestive heart failure, and ankylosing
spondylitis, who presented to an outside hospital with
respiratory failure and hypotension, was intubated for airway
protection and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
# Respiratory failure: The patient was originally intubated for
airway protection and respiratory distress.  He was quickly
extubated.  He was treated with a 10 day course of
levofloxacin/flagyl for aspiration PNA.  The leading diagnosis
was pulmonary edema related to decompensated CHF.  He was
treated for CHF medically with afterload reduction and diuresis
as below. By the time of discharge, he was breathing comfortably
and satting well on room air.
.
# Hypotension: He was initially hypotensive on admission and
briefly pressor-dependent. The etiology was felt to be
multifactorial. High on the differential was  sepsis (aspiration
pneumonia) vs sedation given for intubation.  He is
immunosuppresesed (on Remicaide at home, every 6 weeks, last
dose [**2132-11-27**]). He was covered broadly with Vanco/levo/flagyl
initially but weaned off vancomycin as his cultures remained
negative.  He was kept on Levofloxacin/Flagyl and completed a 10
day course. Blood cultures, sputum culture, and BAL for PCP were
all ne
