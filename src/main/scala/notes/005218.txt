Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1899**]
Chief Complaint:
Elevated Cr

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
65-year-old man with many medical problems, including stage [**Name (NI) 1105**]
CKD, DM2, CAD, PVD, schizophrenia, history of pulmonary embolism
on Coumadin , complex sleep-disordered breathing, obesity
hypoventilation, and pulmonary hypertension presenting for
abnormal labs with a markedly elevated Cr.
.
The patient was at his living facility ([**Hospital3 2558**]) when he
reported feeling unwell on [**3-25**].  He reports decreased PO intake
for the past week due to decreased appetite since increase of
his kayexalate dose.  He also endorsed dry mouth and decreased
urine output.  The evening prior to presentation, he reports
being at a party and eating chicken wings, pizza, cake, and had
eaten a large amount of food.  He subsequently developed
periumbilical/epigastric abdominal pain and substernal chest
pain that lasted for about an hour while at rest.  He denies
dyspnea, lightheadedness, arm/jaw pain, diaphoresis,
nausea/vomiting, or palpitations; denies diarrhea.  He is a poor
historian and unable to relate a precise history, and is not
sure whether his chronic lower extremity edema is changed.  He
reports his dyspnea has been worse over the past several months
on his baseline 2L O2 by nasal cannula, but is unsure of whether
this is acutely worse.  He reports stable 2 pillow orthopnea but
reports he may have had several episodes of PND over the past
several weeks.  He does endorse feeling slightly more confused
in his thinking, but is oriented currently.  He had labs checked
at [**Hospital3 2558**] on [**3-25**] which showed Cr 3.2.  Repeat labs on
[**3-26**] was significant for Cr 4.0 and INR 3.7.  He was sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
Of note, the patient was admitted to medicine [**Date range (1) 82070**] for
hypercarbic respiratory failure after having a facemask placed
in the ED and subsequent somnolence.  His ABG decreased from his
baseline ph 7.35, pCO2 of 69 to pH dropped to 7.24 with a pCO2
of 98.  In the MICU, he was placed on BiPap and stablilized, and
was called out on CPAP overnight.  His settings were titrated by
the respiratory therapist to IPAP 20, EPAP 10, continuous O2 at
3L.  He was found to have an E. coli UTI and was treated with
ceftriaxone, and then switched to Cefpodoxime for a 14 day
course.  He was also determined to be in a diastolic CHF
exacerbation, and was diuresed.  His Cr peak was 2.7 which
decreased to 1.8 with diuresis.
.
He was also admitted for acute renal failure previously from
[**Date range (1) 82071**] with Cr 3.6 in the setting of abdominal pain, poor
appetite, and malaise.  Urine lytes and examination of sediment
were concerning for a prerenal etiology, and he received IVF x
2L for possible dehydration with minimal improvement in his
creatinine.  The nephrology team felt that given his
cardiomegaly and elevated
BNP, heart failure with poor forward flow and renal
hypoperfusion was the cause of his acute renal failure.  An
echocardiogram was unable to be obtained given his body habitus,
but repeat CXR showed worsening vascular congestion and he was
diuresed with Lasix 40 mg IV with improvement in his creatinine
to 2.7.  He was discharged with follow-up with his Neprhologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
In the ED, initial vitals: 97.5 74 98/79 16 100%
CXR and EKG were obtained, and he was admitted to medicine for
further evaluation and management.  Vitals prior to transfer:
97.6F 106/61, 20, 69, 97% 2LNC.
.
Currently, the patient reports continued feeling unwell but
denies abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, or
confusion, although he reports his thinking is not as clear as
it is at baseline.  He reports chronic heel pain and kneecap
tenderness bilaterally.
.
ROS: per HPI, denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache,
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.
