Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope/ST elevations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 69 y/o F with remote history of mitral
prolapse and regurgitation, gastric ulcer (no recent bleeding),
anxiety disorder, smoking history s/p ORIF of wrist yesterday
who presents with lethargy and syncope found to have 1mm ST
elevations of V2V3 and Trop I of 1.99.

The patient has had poor balance recently per family, and
tripped, fell and broke her wrist ~10 days ago. She went for
ORIF at [**Hospital3 417**] yesterday [**2125-2-5**]. In the interim, she had
not been taking much PO, taking sips only. Also, since the
operation, she has been persistently lethargic with
nausea/vomiting, and difficulty standing. She has been taking PO
narcotics for pain control. The patient had an episode of
syncope today. Patient's family reports that she had about 30
seconds of loss of conciousness.

Per report by ED attending, intraop yesterday she recieved a
little fentanyl, propranolol, isoflourine, NO, cevoflourine, and
midazolam. Got 1.5 L NS.

At [**Hospital3 417**] ED, the patient denied chest pain, shortness
of breath, palpatations. She was not mentating that well and
persistently lethargic. Her EKG was notable for V2V3 1mm ST
elevations that looked different than on the preop EKG. Her labs
were notable for CKMB 20.7, CK 826, trop I 1.99, creatinine 3.7.
She recieved ASA 325mg, plavix, levoflox 500mg IV, lasix 40mg
IV, 2L NS, heparin 5000U IV, then 800U an hour, 6mg morphine IV,
narcan 0.4. Renal and RUQ u/s were normal. HR 70s, 104/70,
sytolics 120-130 with fluids. She was transferred here for
treatment of ACS. An ABG was obtained 7.2/63/62/24, given the
hypercarbia, hypoxia and altered mental status, she was
intubated prior to transfer.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was intubated and sedated.
ROS unable to be obtained. Per family, the patient denied any
chest pain or pressure, new exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, PND
or leg edema, palpitations or syncope, claudication-type
symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or transient neurologic
deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit or urinary symptoms.
No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias, myalgias, headache
or rash.  All other review of systems  negative.

Reports/Imaging
TTE The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


CXR [**2125-2-6**]: ET tube is 1.4 cm above the carina. It can be
withdrawn 2 cm for standard position. NG tube tip is in the
stomach but the sideport is at the level of the EG junction and
should be advance for standard position. Biapical pleural
parenchymal scarring is greater on the right side and associated
with upper deviation of the right hilum. The lower lungs are
hyperinflated. There is no evidence of CHF. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Lines and tubes are as described. Evidence of old
granulomatous infection.

ECG [**2125-2-6**] Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

Renal US [**2125-2-10**] IMPRESSION:
1. Normal right renal waveforms.
2. Patient could no longer tolerate exam; no Dopplers on the
left obtained.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Syncope/Demand ischemia: Patient denied CP at OSH, EKG had
mild ST elevations in V2 and V3, but not enough to qualify as a
STEMI. She was initially started on ASA, clopidogrel, statin,
metoprolol, heparin IV. However, her presentation with lethargy
and syncope was not suggestive of ACS, and she has little known
cardiac history and normal lipids. Therefore, these symptoms may
have been multifactorial from recent sedatives and hypovolemia.
The above meds were stopped, except for ASA and metoprolol. She
was volume resuscitated with IVF and remained asymptomatic. Her
trop and CK-MB were mildly elevated, suggesting demand ischemia.
Her CK-MB has since trended down. TTE showed preserve pump
function.

2. Respiratory failure: Patient has long smoking history, ABGs,
physical exam, and CXR consistent with COPD although no previous
diagnosis or PFTs available to confirm. Given her shortness of
breath, occasional wheezing, and dry cough, she was treated for
a
