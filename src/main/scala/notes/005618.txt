Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Left knee pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arthrocentesis, wash-out.
AV fistulagram.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 104435**] is a 60 year-old woman with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD,
breast cancer, and pulmonary sarcoidosis who presented to the ED
on the morning of admission with left knee pain and swelling.
.
Arthrocentesis demonstrated 129,000 WBCs. Gram stain revealed no
organisms and no crystals were seen in the synovial fluid.  She
received vancomycin and was taken to the operating room for
irrigation under general anesthesia (received etomidate,
fentanyl and cisatracurium) prior to presumed transfer to the
floor. Once on the medicine floor, the pt's daughter reported
that the pt's face appeared to be swollen, and she was
transferred back to the PACU. In the PACU, she received
diphenhydramine 12.5 mg IV, famotidine 40 mg PO and
methylprednisolone 80 mg IV.
.
The patient does not complain of shortness of breath, but does
have throat soreness. She does not report throat swelling or
tongue swelling. She denies visual changes.
.
ROS was unobtainable as the patient was markedly somnolent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104435**] is a 60 year-old female with multiple comorbidities
who presented with a swollen, tender, warm left knee.
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
# Septic Arthritis: On arrival to the ED, the patient was
afebrile (T 98.4) with a blood pressure of 144/40.  Physical
exam was notable for a swollen left knee that was exquisitely
tender to palpation.  Arthrocentesis revealed 15 cc of cloudy,
viscous fluid with 129,000 WBC, >90% polys.  Gram stain did not
reveal any organisms.  Crystals were not detected.  She received
vancomycin for a presumed septic joint and was taken to the
operating room for arthrotomy and drain placement.  She was
started on ceftriaxone on [**5-10**] for potential gonococcal
infection.  Lyme serology was negative for lyme antibody.
Tissue cultures and swab cultures did not reveal organisms on
gram stain and showed no anaerobic growth to date as well as no
fungal or acid fast bacilli.  Blood cultures have not grown
anything to date. The patient has remained
