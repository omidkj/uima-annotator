History of Present Illness:
60 y/o man with PMH significant for mesothelioma and COPD
presenting to the ED from [**Hospital6 17032**] with
concern for a hemothorax. Pt had experienced two to three days
of increasing SOB. He reports that before this time he could
move around the house and climb one flight of stairs without
significant SOB. He has slept propped up on the couch for
several years. However, over the last three days, he has noted
an increased SOB. Pt reports that he could not even walk to the
bathroom or hold a long conversation without significant SOB by
yesterday. Pt has had mild cough. His daughter [**Name (NI) 653**] his PCP
who started him on home oxygen but this did not provide any real
relief. Today, when he went in for a previously scheduled CT
scan at the OSH, the SOB had continued to worsen. CT scan showed
a large presumed hemothorax on the right with air in it
suggestive of loculation. There was also a slight shift in the
mediastinum. Labs were significant for a WBC count of 17.7 and
Hct of 32.5.
.
In further discussion, pt denies fevers and chills. Pt has had
five weeks of right sided chest pain and lower right back pain
that is worse with deep inspirations. He reports that this is
completely unchanged over the last several days. Pt reports that
his abdomen feels "hard" to him but denies any abdominal pain.
No nausea or vomiting. His appetite is severely decreased and he
has lost approximately 25 pounds in the last four months. Pt
reports that he moves his bowels every 3 or 4 days. No blood in
the stools. No difficulty with urination. No LE pain but did
develop tenderness over the top of his right foot over the last
two days. He attributes this to slippers which are "too tight".



Past Medical History:
1. Mesothelioma- Diagnosed approximately 5 weeks ago when the pt
presented to his PCP with right sided chest and back pain. He
has not yet started any sort of treatments but reports that he
was scheduled to do so next week.
2. COPD
3. S/P appendectomy


Social History:
Pt is currently living with his daughter. His wife died three
years ago. He works as a printer. Pt smoked one pack per day for
42 years and quit 5 weeks ago when he was diagnosed with the
mesothelioma. No ETOH or drugs

Family History:
Noncontributory.

fatigued by the effort. Sitting upright in attempt to make his
breathing more comfortable.
HEENT- NC AT. Face mask in place. PERRL. Anicteric sclera. EOMI.

Cardiac- Tachycardic. Regular rhythem. No m,r,g.
Pulm- Coarse breath sounds at the very top of the right lung but
otherwise on breath sounds on the right. Coarse breath sounds
throughout the left lung.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2130-6-15**] 7:54 AM
FINDINGS: There has been no change in the extent of
opacification of the right hemithorax and left basilar
atelectasis/consolidation. An endotracheal tube and NG tube
remain in place. No clear pneumothorax is seen on this study.
Pulmonary vasculature in the visualized portion of the left lung
appears normal.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2130-6-9**] 7:26 PM
IMPRESSION:
Near complete opacification of the right hemithorax with small
amount of air seen at the right apex. This is most likely due to
a large pleural effusion. A chest CT is recommended for further
characterization.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST [**2130-6-10**]
3:59 PM
1) No definite evidence of pulmonary embolism on this limited
exam.
2) Multifocal ground glass opacity, most prominent in the basal
segments of the left lower lobe, representing multifocal
pneumonia vs. aspiration.
3) Irregular circumferential right pleural thickening,
consistent with the patient's known history of mesothelioma.
There may be extension to the right lateral chest wall
musculature.
4) Large multiloculated right pleural effusion with pockets of
air, resulting in compressive atelectasis of the right middle
and lower lobes. The majority of the pleural fluid measures
simple fluid.

Study Date of [**2130-6-11**]  11:29:32 PM
ECG
Regular narrow complex tachycardia - mechanism uncertain -
consider AV nodal
reentry
Left ventricular hypertrophy with repolarization changes
Clinical correlation is suggested
No previous tracing for comparison


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 60 y/o man with PMH significant for mesothelioma
transferred from OSH for management of hemothorax who was
intubated for respiratory failure

#respiratory failure
- likely from combination of progressive right sided hemothorax,
progreessive lung cancer and right sided atelextasis, diffuse
ground glass in lungs(CHF vs pneumonia)
- tried diuresis with no improvement in respiratory status,
likely not CHF
- The patient was treated empirically for pneumonnia with
Cefepime/Vanco/Flagyl.
- As the patient did not improve despite intubation and
antibiotics, palliative care was consulted and the patient
ultimately passed away from respiratory failure.
.
#right sided hemothhorax s/p thoracentesis by IP
- CT chest to assess size of hemothorax post tap:complete
atelectasis RML and RLL from hemothorax, ground glass opacity in
LLL
- Thoracic surgery was consulted and felt the patient was not a
candidate for pleurodesis.
.
#pneumonia
- Afebrile with cefepime, vanco, and flagyl.
.
#Mesothelioma(sarcomatoid type)-diagnosed [**4-8**] with recurrent
right pleural effusion, underwent bronchoscopy, VATS and
decortication iwth residula pleural thickening. Planned to be
referred to [**Company 2860**] for chemo vs additional surgery as outpatient.
- spoke to oncologist at [**Hospital1 **]
- palliative care was consulted and the patient later died of
respiratory failure
.
#AVNRT: Occured likely related to hypoxia prior intubation .
.
#hyponatremia
- likely from SIADH
- will not fluid restrict since patient has terminal disease
- sent for urine lytes
.

.
#Code status- Pt reports that he is willing to be
intubated/recussitated. However, he would never want to be on
life support over a few days if there is no hope of
recovery.reiterated with family in ICU and confirmed full code.
Sister is health care proxy. The patient ultimately understood
his very poor prognosis and the patient passed away.
