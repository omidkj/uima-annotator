Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Vomiting and generalized weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation ([**2188-8-24**])

History of Present Illness:
69yoM with complicated medical history including ESRD s/p renal
transplant [**2180**] on Tacro and Prednisone, h/o MI s/p multiple
stents and CABG, DM, chronic afib on Coumadin, presenting on
[**2188-8-24**] with profuse vomiting x 1 night and generalized weakness
x few days, found to be hypoxic in the ED, initially transferred
to the MICU for mechanical ventilatory support/intubation and
suspicion of aspiration pneumonitis.  Pt extubated on [**2188-8-25**]
and now transferred to the floor.
.
Per pt and his wife, he was in his usual state of health until
last Tuesday (one wks ago), when he tripped on a tree root while
clearing brush in the garden, and had an unwitnessed fall
without apparent loss of consciousness.  Pt and his wife doubt
he hit his head, and pt denies any period of confusion,
tongue-biting, or lightheadedness before or after his fall.  He
was able to drive afterward without difficulty.  Around this
time he restarted gabapentin, and on Thursday pt told his wife
he felt like he had the flu, with general malaise and fatigue.
The next day he felt "shaky," weak, and unstable on his feet.
Per pt, he had similar symptoms when he was last on gabapentin.
Pt denied fevers or chills.  He denied seizure-like activity,
changes in vision, headache, language difficulties, or
asymmetric weakness.  On Saturday pt went to his daughter's
engagement party, where he ate mostly chicken and potatoes. That
night, pt began vomiting profuse amounts of food-like material,
non-bloody, that started while he was sleeping on his back.  Per
wife, pt appeared very weak after this episode and had trouble
standing up, so she called 911. Of note, pt has been
noncompliant with his tacrolimus for the past 3 doses as he ran
out of his medications, and he may have taken double his usual
dose of Tacrolimus the evening before presentation. Pt denies
any associated symptoms of cough, chest pain, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, or dysuria.
 .
In the ED, he was found to be hypoxic in the 60s on room air,
and was placed on a NRB with PO2 in the mid 80s. He was
subsequently intubated without difficulty.  Initial CXR showed
b/l opacities, and CT torso confirmed these findings without
additional processes. CT head was ordered for the history of
unwitnessed fall and was negative. The patient was initially
started on Vancomycin 1gm, Cefepime 2gm, and Levofloxacin 750mg
IV. Labs were significant for K+ 5.3 without EKG abnormalities,
lactate 3.7, and Cr 2.7.
.
In the MICU, pt appeared volume overloaded on exam and CXR, with
BNP [**Numeric Identifier 28490**], so he was kept on lasix. His gabapentin was
discontinued.  Valsartan was held pending Cre normalization.  Pt
was noted to have myoclonic jerks in his upper extremities while
sleeping and awake the first night in MICU.  Pt was extubated on
[**2188-8-25**], and he started taking PO.  Tacrolimus was increased to
1mg PO Q12h per transplant rec's.  His Hct dropped from 34.3 on
admission to 26.7, but appeared stable.  Cardiac enzymes were
negative x3.  CXR showed interval improvement, so Cefepime was
stopped on [**2188-8-26**].  Warfarin was restarted that day at 1/2
dose.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.
