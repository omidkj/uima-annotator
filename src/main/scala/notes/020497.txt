Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Allopurinol / Cimetidine / Pioglitazone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath [**3-13**] with DES to RCA, [**3-17**] twice with DES to RCA
both times

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 89y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual
disordered breathing, DM type 2 who presented on [**3-3**] with
anterior chest pain. The patient was worked up for pulmonary
embolism vs ACS. CT chest showed diffuse bronchial wall
thickening, progression of emphysema, progression of
interstitial lung disease but no PE. LENIs were negative.
Cardiac enzymes peaked at CK 109, Trop 1.13. He underwent
cardiac catherization which showed right dominant, LMCA no
significant disease, LAD dieffuse proximal calcification, mid up
to 60%, LCX total occlusion at OM1 take off and then long
subtotal occlusion of OM1 appears chronic, RCA diffuse 90%
proximal and 80% distal, heavily calcified - final dxg 3 vessel
CAD, successful DES to RCA. He was started on [**Month/Year (2) **], plavix, beta
blocker, and ACE.
.
The patient was also seen by pulmonary while in house. They
recommended oral steroids as an outpatient. His hospital course
was also complicated by diarrhea, nausea, vomiting which lasted
for 24 hours, felt likely due to norovirus.
.
This AM, the patient, he developed chest pain after morning
physical therapy, and was taken quickly to [**Hospital3 18648**] where they diagnosed ST segment elevation on his ECG.
He was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] and directed to the catheterization
lab, where prior to procedure he developed VF arrest and was
cardioverted and given 1mg epinephrine with return of
spontaneous circulation. He developed nausea/vomiting following
resussitation and was intubated for airway protection.
.
He was found to have in stent thrombosis of his distal RCA
stent, treated with export of thrombus x2 runs and POBA. IVUS
was performed and also showed that some struts of distal RCA
stent not well apposed, and this was ballooned with good effect.

He remained on dopamine at the end of the case and was
transported to the CVICU pending bed availability in the CCU.
.
Review of systems

The patient denies any orthopnea, PND or leg edema, palpitations
or syncope, claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding,
or transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel
habit or urinary symptoms. No cough, fever, night sweats,
arthralgias, myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of
systems  negative.

[**3-13**] CathFINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Known three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. In stent thrombosis of prior RCA stents.
3. Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Preserved cardiac index (in setting of ionotropic support).
5. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
6. Manual aspiration thrombectomy and PTCA were performed
successfully.
7. IVUS showed underexpansion of the proximal RCA stent struts.
8. Further post-dilations were performed using a 3.75mm diameter
balloon
in the proximal RCA.

[**3-17**] CathFINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful stenting of the mid RCA>

[**3-17**] CathFINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Stent thrombosis in RCA
2. PTCA and stenting of RCA

[**3-17**] EchoThe left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior
akinesis, inferoseptal/inferolateral hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe
global free wall hypokinesis but perservation of the apex. There
is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate [[**1-7**]+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-3-15**],
the right ventricle is more dilated, hypokinetic with evidence
of volume overload.

[**3-15**] EchoThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior/inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild to
moderate ([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-3-3**],
the inferior/inferolateral regional wall motion abnormalities
are now more severe. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is now lower. Mitral regurgitation is now less
prominent.
