ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Admission diagnosis is hypoxia and
pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male with a history of tuberculosis status post numerous
pneumothorax therapies many years ago, who presented to his
cardiologist on the morning of admission for routine followup
and was noted to be markedly dyspneic.  He was noted here to
have a PO2 of 87% on room air.  The patient was suffering
from rigors in the Emergency Department, although his
temperature was only 99.3 orally and axially.  The patient
continued to have oxygen saturations in the high 80s to low
90s on 100% nonrebreather and was then placed on CPAP with
marked improvement in his clinical state, and a PO2 improving
to 97%.  The patient did continue to be tachypneic to the
middle 30s.  Levofloxacin and Flagyl were started, and blood
cultures were sent.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems on admission the
patient states that he had not felt well for approximately
three to four days prior to admission with an increasing
cough that was yellow/green along with wheezing and new
shortness of breath on the morning of admission.  He denies
any sick contacts and has had Pneumovax and influenza
vaccines.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Left lung tuberculosis contracted in a concentration
camp during World War II, and status post pneumothorax
therapy for it.  No medical therapy for tuberculosis.
 2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 3.  Hypertension.
 4.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction and coronary artery bypass graft in [**2096**].
 5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
 6.  Thyroid cancer, status post resection in [**2110**].
 7.  Diverticulosis.
 8.  Prostate atypia.
 9.  Status post right middle cerebral artery with left
hemiparesis that has improved markedly status post t-PA
treatment.
10.  Carotid stenosis.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.h.s.,
Axid 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Synthroid 200 mcg p.o. q.d., Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with wife in [**Name (NI) 1268**].  Was a
[**Doctor Last Name **] in a temple, is now retired and was in a Nazi
concentration camp during World War II.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs were
temperature of 99.3, blood pressure 168/88, pulse 116, oxygen
saturation 97% on BiPAP at 100% FIO2; was 87% on room air.
In general, alert, oriented, and aware times three.  On CPAP,
appeared tachypneic but comfortable.  HEENT revealed moist
mucous membranes.  Neck had no jugular venous distention.  A
well-healed scar.  No lymphadenopathy.  Positive for right
carotid bruit.  Pulmonary with good inspiratory effort on
CPAP, diffuse rhonchi on the right side, fine expiratory
wheezes, and prolonged expiratory phase, markedly decreased
breath sounds on the left.  Cardiovascular had a regular rate
and rhythm, S1 was normal, S2 was loud, and a 1/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the apex.  Abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed +3 pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities,
with small superficial ulcer on left pretibial surface.  Skin
was warm and dry, improved facial complexion.
Neurologically, slight left hand drop (old per records).

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Arterial blood gas on 100%
nonrebreather showed a pH of 7.42, PCO2 of 37, PO2 of 128.
White blood cell count 12.3, hemoglobin 12.6,
hematocrit 40.1, platelets 243.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.2,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 23, BUN 23, creatinine 1.4
(baseline is 1 to 1.5), glucose 113.  Neutrophils 79,
lymphocytes 15, monocytes 4, eosinophils 1.5.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed a collapsed left upper
lobe with pleural thickening and calcifications.  The right
lung was clear.  No changes from previous studies.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per
minute, normal axis.  No ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

 1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was hypoxic on room air on
initial presentation.  Did not improve on 100% nonrebreather
but showed good response to BiPAP.  Arterial blood gas showed
a large A to A gradient most likely secondary to large
atelectasis on the left that was chronic.  CO2 and
bicarbonate were okay.  The patient spent one day in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit and then was transferred to the
floor as he was slowly weaned off various levels of
supplemental oxygen.

When he was transferred to the floor he was maintained on 3
liters nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 97%, and on
the day of discharge was found to have an oxygen saturation
of 97% on room air and an ambulatory oxygen saturation (after
walking 700 feet) of 96%.  He was continued on levofloxacin
for community-acquired pneumonia coverage as well as Flagyl
for the possibility of aspiration pneumonia.  He was then
discharged on this levofloxacin/Flagyl regimen and sent home
to finish a 14-day course.  He was provided with albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizers to help open his airways and moisten
and mobilize secretions.

 2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of angina,
myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2099**].  The patient did not have any cardiovascular symptoms
throughout the course of his stay.  There was no evidence for
congestive heart failure to account for his respiratory
distress, and he was continued on his antihypertensive
medications.

 3.  RENAL:  The patient has a baseline chronic renal
insufficiency most likely secondary to hypertensive
nephropathy.  He was followed with serial BUN and creatinine
levels that remained stable throughout the course of his
stay.

 4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had rigors but no
fevers on presentation.  The source appeared to be pulmonary
by history, but no clear infiltrate was shown on chest x-ray.
The patient was started, and remained on, a course of
levofloxacin and Flagyl to be finished as an outpatient.  His
sputum cultures grew back organisms representing many
morphologies, and blood cultures had no growth at the time of
discharge.

 5.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient remained asymptomatic and
was maintained on PPI throughout the course of his stay.

 6.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient is currently anticoagulated
because of his right internal carotid artery stenosis.  His
INR remained stable, and his baseline dose of Coumadin was
continued.

 7.  ENDOCRINE:  Status post thyroidectomy for cancer.  He
was continued on his baseline Synthroid dose.


 8.  NUTRITION:  The patient has a history of swallowing
difficulties status post cerebrovascular accident.  We
obtained a swallowing study for him that was negative for any
aspiration risk.

 9.  NEUROLOGY:  The patient had a stable examination, status
post a right middle cerebral artery infarct.  The patient
with a known 80% to 90% right internal carotid artery
stenosis and is considered a poor candidate for angioplasty,
and also the patient has refused surgery in the past.

10.  GENITOURINARY:  The patient remained on Flomax for
benign prostatic hypertrophy, and no evidence of obstruction
throughout the course of his stay.

11.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, PPI, and
aspiration precautions prior to the swallowing study that
cleared him.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
