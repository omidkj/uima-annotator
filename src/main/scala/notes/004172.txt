Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 87 yo woman with poorly controlled HTN and CKD (baseline
Cr 1.4-1.6) who initially presented from Benchmark [**Hospital **] Facility after falling out her bed resulting in a left
shoulder dislocation.  This was reduced in the ED.  However, she
was also found to have an NSTEMI secondary to demand ischemia on
admission.  She was seen by cardiology and felt not to be a good
candidate for cardiac cath and recommended medical management.
She was started on ASA and continued on BB and statin.
.
She also continued to complain of RUQ pain and had an elevated
AST/ALT/WBC for which she underwent RUQ ultrasound which showed
GB edema and possible cholecystitis.  She was started on Unasyn
and surgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan which was
attempted but adequate study could not be performed.  Given that
her WBC trended down and pain improved and was toleraing PO's
surgery felt there was a low suspicion for acute cholecystitis.
Also noted to have worsening ARF during her stay and had a
trigger on [**4-7**] for low urine output. Urine sent yesterday was
positive for eosinophils.
.
This evening a code blue was called after patient was found on
the floor in her room and non-responsive.  Per the nursing the
patient had looked well throughout the day with no specific
changes.  They heard the bed alarm go off and found her on the
ground non-responsive.  CPR was initiated, although according to
the first responder resident she never lost a pulse and code
blue called as she was reportedly apneic.  When the MICU team
arrived she was noted to have a sinus rhythm on tele at 50-70
with PAC's, blood pressure was 70/dop, O2sat could not be
obtained and was being bagged by respiratory.  At times she was
breathing spontaneously, however was otherwise not responsive.
A central line was placed in the right femoral vein.  She was
subseuquently intubated without sedation for airway protection.
BP responded without intervention to the 140's/dop.  ABG showed
7.08/41/256.  She was given propofol for agitation after the
intubation.  She was given IVF's and BP remained stable and was
then transferred to the MICU for further care. after arrival in
the MICU an arterial line was placed with SBP 70s and she was
given 1L NS bolus, after which her pressure rose to 120s.

Pertinent Results:
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) LEFT  [**2190-4-4**]
LEFT SHOULDER, THREE VIEWS: The axillary view is limited by
patient positioning. The left humerus now appears to articulate
with the glenoid post reduction, but is minimally anteriorly
subluxed. The large [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] deformity is again appreciated.
On the current exam, there is the question of a Bankhart lesion.
There is extensive calcification of the acromioclavicular
articulation.
IMPRESSION: Limited examination suggests successful reduction of
left shoulder dislocation, though there is evidence of laxity.
Question of bony Bankhart lesion as well.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  7:48 PM
FINDINGS: Two views of the chest demonstrate stable cardiomegaly
with left ventricular configuration. The aorta is tortuous as
before with calcifications of the arch. There is enlargement of
the pulmonary arteries which is chronic. There is no focal lung
parenchymal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
There is chronic inferomedial positioning of the left humeral
head with a large preexisting [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] deformity noted. On
this frontal view, the left humeral head appears to be located
within the glenoid fossa. Also demonstrated are chronic severe
degenerative changes of the right glenohumeral articulation with
pseudoarthrosis with the coracoid process.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Chronic inferomedial positioning of the left humeral head
with large pre- existing [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] deformity.
3. Extensive degenerative change of the right glenohumeral
articulation.
.
HUMERUS (AP & LAT) LEFT  [**2190-4-4**]
FINDINGS: Three views of the left shoulder and three views of
the left humerus were obtained. The left humeral head is
anteriorly dislocated relative to the glenoid. No definite acute
fracture is identified. There is a large pre-existing [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**]
deformity of the left humeral head. There are extensive
degenerative changes of the acromioclavicular and glenohumeral
articulations. No soft tissue abnormality is identified.
IMPRESSION: Anterior dislocation of the left humeral head with
large pre- existing [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] deformity.
.
EKG [**2190-4-4**]: 87bpm, NSR, 1st degree AV delay, LVH
.
HIDA scan [**2190-4-5**]
The study is limited by patient cooperation. Serial flow images
over the
abdomen show poor uptake of tracer into the liver, but excretion
into a tubular structure which may represent a dilated common
bile duct. Tracer activity is then seen in the duodenum. 90
minute static images demonstrate activity in the bowel, but no
clear visualization of the gallbladder. Repeat images were
attempted, but the patient did not wish to continue with the
examination.
IMPRESSION:
Non-diagnostic examination due to technical reasons and patient
cooperation without visualization of the gallbladder. There may
be a dilated common bile duct. A repeat study the following day
after the administration of CCK was recommended.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2190-4-5**]
FINDINGS: One view of the abdomen in supine position. The lower
pelvis and inguinal region are excluded, which limits the study.
No evidence of obstruction. No evidence of dilatation. No
intraperitoneal free air is seen. Severe scoliosis is again
noted.
IMPRESSION: Limited study due to exclusion of the lower pelvis
and inguinal region. No evidence of obstruction.
.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2190-4-5**]
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Compared to MR abdomen of
[**2186-9-19**]. No focal mass lesions are seen in the liver, however,
there is a diffusely prominent pattern of echogenic portal
triads, a nonspecific finding, but occasionally seen with
hepatitis. There is a trace amount of ascites. The gallbladder
wall demonstrates massive edema, with layering sludge, and a
small amount of pericholecystic fluid. The patient is diffusely
tender over the liver, however, more focally tender over the
gallbladder. Multiple large simple- appearing or singly-septated
exophytic renal cysts are only partially imaged on this study.
The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic calcification.
Pancreas is not well visualized. Main portal vein is patent with
appropriate hepatopetal flow. There is no extrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation. There is equivocal mild intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation.
