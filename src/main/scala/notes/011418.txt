History of Present Illness:
51 year old female with history of coronary artery disease
admitted to OSH with DOE for a couple of months and chest pain
for 3 days. She began taking naprosyn for shoulder pain during
these 3 days of increase chest pain. She reports ride sided
chest pain and shortness of breath as well as new PND. She took

[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

[**2168-1-6**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
two
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease.  The LAD had a totally occluded ostium, with
faint
right-to-right and left-to-right collaterals noted.  The LCX had
mild
disease and a widely patent stent.  The RCA had patent stents
with an
ostial PDA lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures, with mean RA pressure of 11 mmHg and mean PCW
pressure of 18
mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary hypertension, with mean PA
pressure
of 34 mmHg and peak PA pressure over greater than [**2-15**] systemic
pressure.
There was mild systemic hypertension, with SBP of 150 mmHg.

Echo:
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
apical akinesis and at least the suggestion of a small apical
aneurysm. The mid-distal septal segments, and distal anterior
walls are severely hypokinetic. The rest of the walls display
mild global hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect
seen. The right ventricle displays borderline normal free wall
function. The right ventricular apex is not well seen. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at
the time of the study.
POST BYPASS Normal right ventricular systolic function. Left
ventricle displays same focal deficits noted in pre-bypass but
other wall segments show improved function. Overall ejection
fraction now about 40%. Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation
improved from pre-bypass - now mild. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2168-1-20**] where the patient underwent coronary
bypass grafting x2 with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending coronary and reverse saphenous vein single
graft from aorta to posterior descending coronary artery.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable
on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  She was started
on iron supplements for a hematocrit of 23.8, for which she was
asymptomatic. Home dose regimen of insulin was reinstituted and
blood sugars were improved at the time of discharge.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. The
patient was discharged home with VNA services and home physical
therapy in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
