History of Present Illness:
PER THE ADMITTING RESIDENT:
49 yo RHM with history of intractible complex partial
epilepsy diagnosed in [**2163**], with cortical sectioning of
epileptic
area of lower central sensory motor strip in [**2165**], s/p left VNS
placement in [**2170**], and history of viral meningitis at age 13,
presenting in status epilepticus.  At 5 PM yesterday, the
patient's wife found him grunting and moving his right leg,
followed by choking and gagging.  Seizures were witnessed for
forty minutes before medical care arrived.  He was originally
taken to [**Hospital 3175**] Hospital where he had a witnessed seizure with
right leg flexion and extension, with hyperventilation and
unresponsiveness, lasting between one and five minutes and given
ativan 2 mg IV x1.  A subsequent seizure occurred and got a
repeat 2 mg ativan and took his PM AEDs including felbatol 1800
mg, keppra 2500 mg, and lamictal 125 mg.  Patient was arranged
for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.  En
route the patient had 3 seizures in the ambulance and had been
given another 8 mg ativan total.  The ambulance had run out of
ativan and patient was continuing to seize for another 12-13
minutes, and was given 2.5 mg valium.  The ambulance stopped at
[**Hospital 1514**] Hospital for further stabilization.  At this facility he
continued to actively seize, given an additional keppra 1g IV
and
ativan 8 mg total, and was subsequently intubated.
Transportation to [**Hospital1 18**] resumed and no further seizure activity
was witnessed.

Per the patient's wife, his typical seizures are characterized
by
right leg extension and flexion, with occasional spread to right
arm along with panting and no loss of consciousness.  He has
been
having more intense and more frequent seizures over the past
month, having up to 15-20 "minor seizures" daily.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital 3175**] Hospital two weeks ago after a 45-minute
seizure and was discharged on ativan 1 mg q4 and his lamictal
was
increased from 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 125 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Also, approximately
two
months ago the patient underwent a  partial amputation of his
right middle finger which was surgically reattached and he has
been on keflex since the procedure.

-depression
-benign hematuria, kidney stones (thought to be [**2-19**] topamax)
- traumatic right third digit amputation, s/p re-attachment
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY

motor strip [**11/2165**],
- left VNS placement [**6-/2170**], with VNS replacement [**8-18**]
- left L4-5 hemilaminectomy, median facetectomy and L4-5
disketctomy [**10/2164**]
- tonsillectomy
- vasectomy

Social History:
The patient lives with his wife.  Had worked as truck driver and
mechanic.  Reportedly, he has used cigarettes and pipes in the
past.  He enjoys alcohol occasionally. There is no history of
recreational drug use.


Family History:
The patient reports that two of his children developed seizures
as infants, which resolved by six months of age.  Due to
adoption, the remainder of family history is unclear.


Physical Exam:
The patient's neurological examination was notable for symmetric
hyporeflexia in all four limbs (baseline per patient).

IMAGING:
CT HEAD ([**2181-8-31**]):
A 3 mm extra-axial density in the left frontotemporal subdural
space adjacent
to an area of surgical change in the calvarium. Differential
diagnosis
includes a small acute-to-subacute subdural hematoma versus
post-surgical
dural thickening.
MRI HEAD ([**2181-8-31**]):
* No acute infarction.
* Small focus of FLAIR hyperintensity in the left inferolateral
frontal cortex,
is of uncertain nature. A followup complete study, per Seizure
protocol can
be considered including spinecho postcontrast sequences.
* Correlation with EEG is also recommended to assess the
significance of this
finding. No abnormal foci of enhancement. Evaluation of the
hippocampi is
limited due to the lack of coronal T2 and the FLAIR sequences.
However, no
gross abnormality noted on the sequences available.
NECK SOFT TISSUE ([**2181-8-31**]):
The study is markedly limited due to patient's large body
habitus as well as
technique. There is again seen a left vagal nerve stimulator to
the left of
the mid cervical spine. The tip is approximately to the level of
the mid-to-
lower cervical spine, unchanged since chest radiograph from
earlier today.
Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are again seen.
RIGHT THIRD DIGIT FILMS ([**2181-9-4**])
There is a fracture of the base of the third distal phalanx,
with slight
(cortical width) palmar displacement of the distal fragment, but
otherwise
overall anatomic alignment. There is faint callus adjacent to
the fracture
site, though the fracture line remains visible. The DIP joint is
congruent and
grossly unremarkable. There is surrounding soft tissue swelling.
No obvious
bone destruction to suggest osteomyelitis is identified, though
subtle
osteomyelitis at the fracture site or subtle soft tissue abcess
would be
difficult to exclude.
The remainder of the middle finger is within normal limits,
without evidence
of bone destruction.
CT TORSO WITH ANGIOGRAM ([**2181-9-4**]):
1. Embolic occlusion of the segmental artery supplying the
posterior segment
of the left upper lobe.
2. No evidence of central PE.
3. Pulsation artifacts in both the left and right lower lobe
segmental
arteries, small emboli in the left dorsal segmental arteries can
therefore not
be excluded.
4. No evidence of right cardiac abnormalities.
5. No evidence of substantial lung parenchymal damage.
LOWER EXTREMITY NON-INVASIVE IMAGING ([**2181-9-5**]):
There is no ultrasound evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
relation to either lower limb.
EEG RECORDINGS
EEG [**2181-9-1**]:
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured two pushbutton activations,
one for
a presumed seizure with no change in the background activity.
There was
no clear epileptiform, ictal or interictal activity throughout
this
recording. The background activity was dominated by excessive
beta
range activity suggestive of medication effect. Ho
