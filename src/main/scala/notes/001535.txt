History of Present Illness:
78F PMH of type I DM complicated by nephropathy, neuropathy, and
retinopathy, osteoporosis, CKD (baseline Cr 2.0) and recent
NSTEMI in [**6-/2184**] who is presenting with recurrent syncope [**1-29**] to
short episdoes of asystole since this AM.
.
Patient has h/o of gastroparesis and chronic nausea and
abdominal dyscomfort. She was at her baseline state of health
until this morning. At noon after taking 2 bites of her
sandwiched, she developed sudden nausea and had wretching X1,
immediately there after she syncopized per her husband with some
irregular limb movements w/o incontinence or tongue bite.
Husband caught her she did not fall on the floor and did not hit
her head. She reacovered after 30 seconds and came to quickly.
She recalls feeling faint but otherwise denies any preceeding
palpitaions, chest pain or other symptoms except nausea and
wretching. After ~ 10 minutes she had another identical episode
at which point her husband call EMS. En route EMS noted episode
of 6s of asystole and patient becoming unresponsive.
.
Upon arrival to the ED VS: 98.2 59 140/53 17 100%RA,
transcutaneous pacer pads were placed on patient. During
observation in ED patient bradyed down to the 40's, then had
about 10 second pause with syncope which ended with junctional
beat then sinus took over in the 50's. Half a milligram of
atropine was given with HR increasing only to the 60's. Initial
Glu 100, but 50 on repeat for which she recieved IV D50% 50cc.
EKG showed new T-wave inversions in the inferior leads
Trop = 0.08 X1
WBC 3.8, Hct 26, PLT 105 all at recent baseline, cr/BUN 2.3/70
at baseline
CXR: (my read), AP film hyperinflation, prominent hili and
increased mildly interstitial markings which are not
significantly changed from prior.
.
Of note patient's recent history includes admission [**2097-7-17**] for
NSTEMI, at the time presented with chest pain new ST depressions
and positive biomarkers and had MIBI showing a moderate fixed
inferior wall defect without reversible defects. Echocardiogram
showed new inferior wall motion (compared to [**2178**] prior) with
LVEF 45%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild mitral
regurgitation, and mod PHTN (PASP 52 mm Hg above RA pressure).
Given concern for her renal functions and no reversible defects
on MIBI she was medically managed with ASA 325mg, [**Year (4 digits) **] 300,
atorvastatin 80 and metoprolol tartrate PO. More recently she
was admitted [**2087-9-9**] for worsening peripheral tingling which
after neg head CT was attributed to natural progression of her
peripheral neuropathy. On this admission was also noted to be
hypertensive to the 200's and was started on amlodipine which
she had been taking in the evenings intermitently only if her
SBP's > 130. She has otherwise been stable at home, no other
recent med changes. No new complaints beyond fatigue and ongoing
chronic complaints as per ROS below.
