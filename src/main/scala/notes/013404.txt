Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy [**2161-1-17**]

History of Present Illness:
60 year old man with metastatic NSCLC (R hilar mass) s/p
chemotherapy (Navelbine) and completed course of radiation, also
membranous nephropathy, CAD, schizophrenia, and COPD who is
transferred from micu after presenting with hemoptosis from
[**Hospital **] rehab. There he had been coughing up about 1 teaspoon
of blood per day since [**2161-1-13**]. His Hct was stable. He denies
SOB, CP, fever, or chills. In the MICU his hemoptysis resolved,
hct remained stable, no transfussion required. He had a
bronchoscopy [**1-18**] that showed his right hilar mass but no
stigmata of bleeding. He was treated for COPD exacerbation with
z-pak (started [**1-18**]) and prednisone taper.
.
Of note, He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2160-11-27**]- [**2160-12-27**] with
a pathologic fracture of his left femur which was treated with
radiation. He was evaluated but surgery was felt medical
management was best for his fracture. His course was complicated
by hospital acquired pneumonia (sputum grew pseudomonas),
treated with a 2 week course of Zosyn, followed by a two week
course of Ceftaz which was started b/c he was hypotensive and
repeat sputum culutres grew sparse GNRs and oropharyngeal flora.

.
Currently he has no complaints. He notes occaisional headaches
but none currently and intermittent constipation though had BM
on date of transfer. He denies visual changes, hearing changes,
congestions, sore throat, chest pain, nausea, vomitting,
abdominal pain, shortness of breath, dysuria, melena, BRBPR, leg
pain other than left hip (which currently is not painful), back
pain, tingling or numbness.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with metastatic NSCLC, COPD, CAD, HTN, recent
pathologic L femur fx, admitted from rehab with hemoptysis.
.
Hemoptysis:  This was felt to be most likely secondary to NSCLC
with R hilar mass.  He had a bronch on [**2161-1-17**] that showed no
stigmata of current or recent bleeding.   He continued to have
intermittent blood-tinged sputum during this hospitalization.
His hct steadily declined until [**2161-2-6**], when his hct was 19.5,
he was given 2 units of pRBC.  His hct remained stable at ~29-30
throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.  Of note on
[**2161-2-20**], he had an increased amount of blood in his sputum.
Interventional pulmonary was called and felt that a repeat
broncoscopy would not be useful at this time, given no finding
on previous broncoscopy.  They recommended IR guided
embolization if hemoptysis were to persist.  Pt was monitored
closely [**Date range (3) 39588**], hemoptysis resolved and hct remained
stable.  Of note, pt was continued on lovenox for DVT ppx in the
setting of hip fracture.  Pt should have his coags and renal
function checked on the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2161-2-21**].
Baseline renal function is between 1.6 to 1.8.  He should also
have a hct check on [**2-22**].
.
COPD Flare: The patient had a productive cough and was wheezing
throughout his hospital course.  He was given a course of
z-pack.  His prednisone was initally doubled to 40mg daily but
because his symptoms did not improve and he was placed on 60mg
daily on [**2161-1-18**].  This was tapered and he resumed his home
regimen of prednisone of 20 mg daily.  He was maintained on
albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers.  His oxygen saturations
remained in the 90's on RA.
.
Dysuria:  He had intermittent dysuria throughout this hospital
course.  His urine culture from [**2-16**] and [**2-19**] revealed coag
negative staph, he was started on microbid for a total of 10 day
course.  A renal US on [**2-18**] was done to further evaluate for
potential post-obstructive picture and was normal.  Bladder
scans were also done to rule out urinary retention as a
potential cause of his dysuria.  He was restarted on flomax.
For symptomatic relief he was also started on pyridium as well.

.
Left femur fx: Medically managed throughout the hospital course,
given that he is a poor surgical candidate.  His pain was
managed with oxycontin, lidocaine patch and oxycodone prn.  On
[**2161-2-13**], he reported having worsening left lower extremity pain
and worsening swelling at the level of the hip.  A CT scan of
the hip revealed further dislocation of the femur and increased
hematoma.  Orthopedic surgery was reconsulted and continued
medical management was recommended.  He is able to bear weight
on both legs as it is tolerated.  He was also started on lovenox
for DVT ppx.
.
Leukocytosis: WBC to 18 on [**2161-1-28**] of unclear etiology.  His
urinalysis, blood culture and cx-ray were unremarkable during
this hospitalization.  He did have urine cultures postive for
coag negative staph and was started on macrobid.  WBC normalized
throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
.
NSCLC: followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] here at [**Hospital1 18**], he had an appointment
at [**Hospital3 328**] for a 2nd opinion on [**2161-1-29**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 39589**] also
felt that he is not a candidate for further chemotherapy.
.
Chest pain:  On [**2161-2-18**], began to report right sided chest pain
near port.  No evidence of infection.  Cx-ray revealed proper
placement of port and no evidence of rib fractures.  His EKG was
without acute ischemic changes.  His pain was managed with
oxycodone prn.
.
CKD: Pt has history of membranous nephropathy associated with
malignancy. Baseline Cr 1.6-1.8.  His creatinine remained near
its baseline throughout this hospital course.
.
HTN:  His blood pressure was labile early during his
hospitalization with SBP ranging between 80 and 200.  He was
initially on lisinopril and diltiazem.  However due to
subsequent hypotensive episodes to the 80s resolving with
hydration, his antihypertensives were discontinued.  His BP
remained stable in the 100-130s throughout the remainder of his
hospital course
.
CAD s/p CABG: The patients aspirin was held in the setting of
hemoptysis but was restarted prior to discharge.  His statin was
continued.
.
Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine at home dose
