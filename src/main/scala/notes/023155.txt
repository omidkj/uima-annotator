Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CPAP

History of Present Illness:
62 yo M with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to lung and spine
with recent XRT to thoracid spine, hemochromatosis, HTN,
admitted for respiratory distress. Limited history is available
from the patient given his respiratory distress.
.
Patient reported acute onsert SOB that woke him up at 4am.  EMS
was called and he had a sat of 79% which increased to 94% on a
NRB.  He was initially going to the VA but looked too clinically
unstable so came to [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97 165/86 109 22 94% on combivent neb
with NRB.   He was placed on CPAP and did well. EKG with STD
v4-v6.  Cards reviewed and advised ASA and statin. He was
stridorous and received racemic epi without significant effect.
He was noted to have chronic venous stasis changes and his BNP
was ~1200, so he was given lasix 20mg as thought was pulmonary
edema.  CTA was discussed with patient by attending given CKD
(Cr 1.5 which is baseline) and patient declined CT as he is also
s/p nephrectomy.  He was also teated with iv methyl pred and
nebs. He initially was able to be weaned to 4L nc, but after CT
was worsening and was put back on non-invasive ventilation.  The
MICU fellow evaluated the patient and had a code discussion.
The patient stated he did not want heroic measures and did not
want to be intubated.
.
On arrival to the floor, he is acute distress and only able to
answer yes/no questions.  He denies chest pain but endorses
chest tightness and significant difficulty breathing.

Discharge labs:
Cr 1.5
.
CXR ([**5-24**]):
1. Bibasilar opacities and blunting of the right costophrenic
angle correspond to pleural effusions, overlying atelectasis,
and possible pulmonary edema and metastatic disease on
subsequent chest CT.
2. Nodular opacity in the left mid lung corresponds to pulmonary
nodule on
subsequent CT consistent with metastasis.
.
CT Head ([**5-24**]):  No evidence of metastatic disease in this
non-contrast CT head.  An MRI is more sensitive for more
sensitive for metastatic disease
.
CT Chest ([**5-24**]):
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary metastatic disease. Bibasilar
consolidations, may represent a combination of metastatic
disease or atelectasis. Superimposed infection is not excluded.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Extensive osseous metastatic disease of the thoracic spine
and bilateral ribs.
.
CT Neck ([**5-24**]):
Extensive osseous metastatic lesions in the lower cervical spine

and upper thoracic spine as described in detail above, also
involving the
ribs, correlation with MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine is
recommended for characterization of the thecal sac and rule out
spinal cord involvement. Mild multilevel degenerative changes at
C5/C6. Atherosclerotic calcifications are visualized at the
cervical carotid bifurcations. The airway appears patent.
Multiple pulmonary nodules in both lungs with bibasilar
consolidations and interstitial thickening also suggesting
metastatic disease, please refer to the report of the dedicated
CT of the chest performed concurrently.
.
TTE ([**5-25**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal global
biventricular systolic function. Technically suboptimal to
exclude focal wall motion abnormality
.
CXR ([**5-25**]):
In comparison with the study of [**5-24**], there is increase in the
bilateral pulmonary opacifications, most likely consistent with
pulmonary
edema and underlying metastatic disease (seen on prior CT scan).
In the
appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening
pneumonia would have to also be considered.
.
CXR ([**5-26**]):
In comparison with the study of [**5-25**], there is little overall
change. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications again are
most likely
reflective of pulmonary edema and underlying metastatic disease
that was seen on the previous CT scan. In the appropriate
clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would
have to be considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year diagnosed with RCC 1 year ago with mets to lungs and
spine s/p XRT and dexamethasone taper who was admitted to the
MICU for respiratory distress resolving well with diuresis.
.
#. Hypoxic Respiratory distress:
Patient with hypoxia in the setting of flash pulmonary edema,
chest xray at admission showed right sided opacity and bilateral
infiltrates consistent with edema and pneumonia.  The patient
was diuresed with Lasix IV and had a net loss of near 9 liters
in the medical ICU with very good improvement of respiratory
status.  He also had purulent sputum concerning for pneumonia.
He was given broad spectrum antibiotics in the ED, and covered
with Levofloxacin/Ceftriaxone which was subsequently narrowed to
levofloxacin in the medical ICU.  Sputum cultures were sent and
showed only commensal respiratory flora. Echocardiogram showed
normal global biventricular systolic function and there was no
significant pathology seen at the valves. He was transferred out
of the ICU to the general medical floor where he was given one
dose of 40mg Lasix by m
