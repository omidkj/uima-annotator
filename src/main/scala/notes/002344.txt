Admission Date:  [**2194-4-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2194-5-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2117-10-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 96823**] is an unfortunate
76 year old gentleman unrestrained driver of an SUV who was
rear-ended at a moderate to high speed.  The patient's car
jumped out of a curve and hit a brick wall with significant
front end damage.  Air bags were deployed.  The patient had
positive loss of consciousness with no recall of the events.
he was found by the paramedics and transferred here to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for further evaluation.

Upon arrival, he was complaining of face pain, neck pain and
shoulder pain.  He denied any headache, chest pain or
shortness of breath.  He had facial lacerations that were not
actively bleeding.  He also had epistaxis of bilateral nares
with a right eyelid significant swelling.

His initial trauma evaluation revealed that he sustained
fractures of the nasal bones as well as the spleen, of C4 and
5 cervical spine with anterior widening of the fracture of
the right facet joint.  He was stabilized in the Trauma Bay
and Neurosurgery Spine Service was called for consultation as
well as Ophthalmology and ENT.  At that time, he was denying
blurry vision, numbness, weakness, tingling or any other
neurological symptoms.  He was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for close monitoring and he was started on a
protocol.

He was electively intubated on [**4-15**] due to oropharyngeal
bleeding and high risk of aspiration with initiation of a
Propofol drip for sedation at that time.  The patient was
transiently hypotensive to the low 60's over 30's with a map
of 40.  This improved with fluids and adjustment of his
Propofol.

He was noticed to have a rise in his creatinine and while
awaiting cardiac clearance and a renal consultation, the
patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Prostate cancer.
3.  Status post brachy therapy.
4.  History of breast cancer status post left mastectomy.
5.  History of supraventricular tachycardia; he underwent a
pre-procedure catheterization which demonstrated 60 to 70%
mid left anterior descending with 50 to 60% proximal diagonal
to a 60% proximal right coronary artery.  No percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed.  He
underwent ablation for supraventricular tachycardia on [**2194-3-19**], for an atypical nodal re-entry.
6.  The patient had a history of distant appendectomy.
7.  Status post left hip replacement.
8.  Status post bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
9.  Status post left rotator cuff repair.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Tamoxifen.
2.  Metoprolol.
3.  Lisinopril.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Magnesium oxide.
6.  Verapasol.
7.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
8.  Colace.
9.  Folate.
10. Colchicine.
11. Allopurinol.
12. Vitamin B12.

ALLERGIES:   The patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He was a former smoker, quit in [**2161**]; drinks
one to two martinis every day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His examination upon admission, he had
a blood pressure of 196/90; heart rate of 80; respiratory
rate of 18; 99% on two liters nasal cannula; his temperature
was 98.6 F.  In the Trauma Bay, he was awake, alert, oriented
times three, [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Score of 15.   Neck was in a
collar.  He was noted to have a laceration on the left side
of the nose, hematoma in the right upper and lower eyelids,
bleeding from the nose more on the right than the left side,
bruise on the left eye, with no bleeding.  His mouth and face
were stable.  Trachea in the midline.  No crepitus.  Good
respiratory effort and clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, no
scars.  Pelvis was stable.  Back showed no step-offs, no
tenderness to palpation.  Rectal examination showed normal
tone, guaiac negative.  Extremities with superficial
abrasions; all peripheral pulses were present.

LABORATORY:  His hematocrit upon arrival was 38.4, white
blood cell count of 11.6 with a platelet count of 214.  His
coagulation studies were within normal limits with a lactate
of 2.2.  His gas showed a pH of 7.49, CO2 of 31, O2 of 82,
bicarbonate of 24 with a base excess of 1.

His chest x-ray was unremarkable.  The cervical spine, as
stated above, showed a C4-5 sprain injury.  Pelvis showed no
fractures.

A head CT scan showed a left temporal lobe subarachnoid
hemorrhage with a question of a small subdural hematoma in
the right temporal region.  There was a right nasal bone
fracture.  The chest CT scan and the abdomen shows some
degenerative joint disease of the thoracic spine and pleural
thickening, otherwise the rest of the scans were
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL PROGRESS AND COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 96823**], on [**4-18**], was
taken to the Operating Room by the Neurosurgical team after
cardiac clearance and underwent a C4-5 anterior fusion with
diskectomy and fixation.  This included an open reduction of
a hyperextension injury followed by a C4-5 ALDF with a fibula
allograft and ventral screw plate fixation.  This patient
tolerated well the complicated procedure and he was
transferred in stable condition to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.

His postoperative course was complicated by a peri-operative
myocardial infarction with a high troponin and
supraventricular tachycardia that required cardioversion.
Cardiology was again consulted and they recommended to start
him on Amiodarone as well as beta blockers.

Over the course of the next couple of days, he remained
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] hemodynamically speaking.  He was not
spiking fevers and we tried to wean him off the ventilatory
support.  On this effort, he was aggressively diuresed since
he was very positive after the surgery.  He continued to
require suctioning multiple times on the different shifts and
he was producing fairly large amounts of bronchial
secretions.

The patient failed T-piece trials, especially due to the
increased bronchial secretions and it was decided clinically
at that time to place a tracheostomy.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
put a #8 Portex tracheostomy on [**2194-4-25**].  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.

Once the patient had a tracheostomy, he was able to wean much
easier and faster and by postoperative day number eight, he
was on 100% trache collar, tolerating it well with good O2
saturations.  Around this time, he was much more awake than
prior days; he was following commands.  He remained afebrile
with moderately elevated white count in the 15,000.  He
continued to have massive amount of secretions requiring
suctioning from the nursing staff fairly frequently.
Multiple sputum samples were sent for culturing to the
Microbiology Laboratory but nothing grew out initially.

He started to spike temperatures and because of the
increasing amount of secretions he was started on
Levofloxacin empirically.  Over the course of the next couple
of days, he was bronchoscoped multiple times and on the 10th,
a bronchial alveolar lavage sample was sent to Microbiology
and finally came positive for Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  He was started on Vancomycin and the
Levofloxacin was discontinued.

Around this time, when the patient continued having increased
bronchial secretions, he had sporadic events of cardiac
arrhythmias presenting as supraventricular tachycardia to the
130s, always maintaining good blood pressure.  Once again,
Cardiology recommended to continue the Amiodarone and the
beta blockers.  On the night of [**5-5**], the patient
bradied down to the 40s, requiring Atropine to increase his
heart rate and the Amiodarone as well as the Lopressor was
held.  The patient was started on Dopamine and Levophed to
keep his blood pressure, and a new Cardiology evaluation was
obtained.  Their recommendation was to hold the Amiodarone
and the beta blockers and wean the pressors as tolerated.

By the next day he converted to normal sinus rhythm and he
was restarted on a lower dose of beta blockers, Lopressor
12.5 mg p.o. twice a day or three times a day if blood
pressure allowed.
