Pertinent Results:
[**2134-4-3**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale
is present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The appearance of the ascending aorta is consistent
with a normal tube graft. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A
mobile density is seen in the distal aortic arch consistent with
an intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile density is seen in
the descending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion appears to
have the consistency of blood. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of
the results in the operating room at the time of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3311**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-4-3**] for emergency
surgery for tamponade. He was taken to the operating room where
evacuation of clot and hemostasis was achieved. Postoperatively
he was taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring. He
remained intubated and sedated overnight with tight blood
pressure control. On postoperative day one, he was allowed to
wake and was extubated. The endocrinology service was consulted
for elevated catecholamines in his urine. Pheochromocytoma was
very unlikely given no adrenal lesions on ultrasound. His blood
pressure will be watched as an outpatient and further worked-up
will be performed if his blood pressure becomes unmanageable.
Later on postoperative day two, he was transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. He worked with physical therapy
daily. He continued to make steady progress and was discharged
to his home on [**2134-3-11**]. He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
his primary care physician as an outpatient. As he currently
does not have a cardiologist, an appointment has been made for
him to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
