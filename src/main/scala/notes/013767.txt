Brief Hospital Course:
62yo M with prior coarctation of the aorta s/p repair 48yrs ago.
 Had flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation on [**10-12**].  Had
+ETT showing anterior ischemia, for which he underwent cardiac
catheterization that showed coronary arteries with minimal
disease except for D1 disease with elevation of left and right
sided filling pressures and preserved cardiac index.  A caridac
Echo revealed a bicuspid valve, with a peak AV gradient of 20,
and a trans coarctation gradient of 22, mild AS, mild MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 227**]
the severity of his disease the cardiac surgery service was
consulted.  He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner.
On [**2110-1-29**] he successfully underwent a redo sternotomy,
coarctation repair with ascending to descending aorta bypass
homograft utilizing a 18mm Gelweave.  Afterward he was
transferred to the Cardiac surgery recovery unit in stable
condition and awakened neurologically intake.  He was weaned
from ventilator support and extubated.  Overnight he had
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was treated with Amiodarone
bolus and drip.  On POD 3 is chest tubes were removed without
complication, and his pressors were weaned.  He was gently
diuresed to his preoperative weight, beta blockade and aspirin
therapy were resumed.  Mr. [**Known lastname 951**] had a precipitous drop in his
platelet count for which a heparin PF4 antibody was obtained.
This study was positive and all heparin was discontined, and
argatroban was started in lieu of his continued afib.  He
required aggressive diuresis to improve his pulmonary function.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed.  On POD 5 his epicardial
pacing wires were removed without complication.  He was then
transferred to the Stepdown unit for further recovery.  The
Physical therapy service was consulted regarding strenght and
conditioning.  he continued to  slowly improve his ability to
ambulate including climbing stairs without respiratory distress
or chest pain.  Anticoagulation was initiated with coumadin on
POD7.  He continued to require albuterol nebs to maximize his
pulmonary function which remained suboptimal. The evening of
POD7  He was transferred back to the CSRU for aggressive chest
PT, and a flexible bronchoscopy was performed for therapuetic
aspiration.  A chest CT revealed Left pleural effusion which was
removed via thoracentesis (1200cc serosanguinous).  On POD 11 He
was transferred back to the stepdown unit.  On POD12 Mr. [**Known lastname 951**]
began having serosanguinous drainage at the inferior portion of
his sternotomy for which he was placed on Vanc.  He remained
afebrile without leukocytosis.  On POD17 He was placed on
levofloxacin and Vanc was d/c'd.  Mr. [**Known lastname 951**] was at his preop
weight with good exercise tolerance, no SOB, or Chest pain.  His
blood pressure was stable.  His sternotomy was clean, dry, and
intact without evidence of infection.  He was discharged home on
POD19 with services in good condition, cardiac diet, sternal
precautions, and instructed to follow up with his PCP and
cardiologist in [**12-9**] weeks.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**]
in four weeks.
