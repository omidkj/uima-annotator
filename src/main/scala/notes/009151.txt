Admission Date:  [**2143-2-15**]       Discharge Date:  [**2143-2-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2069-5-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 11522**] is a pleasant
73-year-old female who presented preoperatively for an
electrode mitral valve replacement, as well as coronary
artery bypass graft surgery.  She has had recurrent episodes
for congestive heart failure and chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes.
2.  Hypertension.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glipizide.
2.  Atenolol.
3.  Univasc.
4.  Lasix.
5.  Isordil.
6.  Nitroglycerin patch.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient is a well appearing 73-year-old female
in no acute distress.
SKIN:  Intact.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Unremarkable.
NECK:  No jugular venous distention.  Trachea was midline.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well perfused.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented, had no carotid bruits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 11522**] presented to the hospital for
an elective coronary artery bypass graft and a mitral valve
replacement.  She received this operation on [**2143-2-15**] with the following anatomy:

1.  Left internal mammary artery to LAD.
2.  Saphenous vein graft to PDA.
3.  Mitral valve replacement.
4.  Carotid endarterectomy.

Initially, Mrs.[**Known lastname 11523**] postoperative course was
unremarkable.  She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
for her initial postoperative care.  She was transferred out
of Intensive Care on postoperative day #2 and was undergoing
physical therapy for her discharge to home.  On the night of
[**2-19**], however, she developed atrial fibrillation which
was not an unexpected event, given a large left atrium found
intraoperatively.

Initially, her atrial fibrillation was managed with Lopressor
and had to be further managed with amiodarone loading.  She
was also started on anticoagulation as per recommendation by
cardiology/electrophysiology.  Her anticoagulation was
initially heparin drip which was switched to Coumadin and
once an INR of 1.5 or above was achieved, heparin was
stopped.

At this time, given her deconditioning secondary to bed rest
and atrial fibrillation which was required because of
tachycardia secondary to exertion, Mrs. [**Known lastname 11522**] required a
longer convalescence.  Her urine output was also found to be
inadequate, which was assessed to be likely secondary to poor
atrial kick.  She therefore received transthoracic
echocardiogram which was unchanged from her preoperative
report.  Given these findings, she was reevaluated by
cardiology and on [**2143-2-26**] she was cardioverted
back into sinus rhythm.  Since her cardioversion, she has
remained stable in sinus rhythm and her Lopressor had to be
decreased in dose secondary to higher dose during her atrial
fibrillation for rate control.  She currently need
rehabilitation for physical therapy work and to meet
discharge goals.  Her renal function is also improving post
cardioversion.

On discharge, she is able to ambulate, is tolerating regular
diet, is voiding spontaneously.  She is in sinus rhythm and
her renal function is improving.  She is to follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in his office within one month and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**]
for cardiology within one month.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg po qd x1 month, starting [**2-28**],
then 200 mg po qd, then as per cardiology.
2.  Colace 100 mg po bid.
3.  Glipizide 5 mg po qd.
4.  Zantac 150 mg po bid.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg po qd.
6.  Captopril 12.5 mg po tid.
7.  Lopressor 25 mg po bid.
8.  Insulin sliding scale regular before meals and at bed
time with blood sugar of 200 to 250 give 3 units
subcutaneous, with 251 to 300 give 9 units subcutaneous, with
301 to 350 give 12 units subcutaneous.  The patient's blood
sugars have been running in the high 100s.
9.  Lasix 20 mg po qd x3 days.
10. Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents po qd x3 days.

FOLLOW UP:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within one month and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in
cardiology in one month.

Please monitor electrolytes while patient is on diuretic.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Mitral regurgitation.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Coronary artery bypass graft x2.
4.  Mitral valve replacement.
5.  Postoperative atrial fibrillation, now in sinus.
