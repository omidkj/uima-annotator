ORIF of left hip

History of Present Illness:
86 [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 45534**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after
unwitnessed fall/L hip fracture & ? C-spine injury (? fracture
of C1 and C2), initially scheduled for [**Hospital3 **]-trauma hip surgery.

   In ED, [**Hospital3 **]/trauma surgery plan for L femoral neck fracture
and ? cervical vertebrae injury, admitted to medicine for
syncopal episode and pre-op assessment.
   On [**10-15**] AM, medicine administered beta blockade in
preparation for OR, SBPs/HR and hemodynamics stable overnight,
with admission hct 38.  In PACU, noted to have SBP in 70s,
required peripheral dobutamine and neosynephrine to maintain
MAPs >60, hct drop to 26.4 --> transfused 1 unit, given 1L [**Hospital **]
transferred to MICU.
   Upon transfer to MICU at 1130am, left subclavian/axillary
line placed with stabilization of systolic pressures >100,
transitioned to levophed.  At 12:31, pt had bradycardia -->
asystolic arrest, had immediate CPR with intubation, 2 epi, 1
atropine, with resumption of pulse and pressure at 12:39pm.  EKG
showed st-depressions v3-v5, transfused 1 unit PRBCs with hct
rise to 26.7, given 1L NS, repleted calcium/magnesium, levophed
administered to maintain MAPs>60, lactate 4.0 - 5.0, R-A line
placed.  CXR showed no pulmonary edema, ?globular heart, bedside
echo initial read showed no tamponade with EF~30%.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
[**2168-10-12**]: report from [**Hospital3 15402**] head CT [**10-12**]
[**2168-10-13**]: CT head scan w/o contrast at [**Hospital3 15402**] : No hemorrhage
or mass effect. See report in chart.
.
[**2168-10-13**]: CT of cervical spine at [**Hospital3 15402**]: Good healing of the
fracture at the base of the odontoid process. There is evidence
of a fracture on the right side of the body of C2 posteriorly
and superiorly wher there was a fracture previously so I do not
know if this is due to poor healing or a new fracture. There
appears to be an undisplaced fracture involving the right side
of the posterior arach of C2 which I cannot identify on the last
exam. Otherwise, there is a cervical spondylosis.
.
[**2168-10-14**] CXR: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2168-10-14**] L HIP/FEMUR XR:

Brief Hospital Course:
Overall course:  patient was brought to hospital with hip
fracture, admitted to medicine.  Due to hemodynamic instability
was transferred to MICU where found to have HCT drop of 10pts.
Subsequently had bradycardic arrest, successful resuscitation.
Went to the OR and had ORIF of left hip.  Subsequently became
septic with E coli in sputum, Citrobacter in blood, started on
ABX.  Also started on metronidazole for Cdiff but d/c'd when
toxins came back negative.   Electrophysiology evaluated the
patient and determined that while no intervention is required
now outpatient followup in [**12-29**] months is indicated.

1). Hip Fracture:  According to the family, the patient fell out
of his bed while trying to get up; he is non-ambulatory at
baseline. The patient was taken to the emergency room on [**10-18**]
for an ORIF of his left hip.  He tolerated the procedure well
and was placed on Lovenox prophylaxis afterwards.  He continued
to work with occupation and physical therapy during his stay.
He will continue Lovenox until his INR is therapeutic (between
2.0 and 3.0).

2). Sepsis/Hypotension:  The patient was hypotensive requiring a
MICU transfer for pressors in the setting of a 10 point
hematocrit drop over an 18 hour period shortly after admission.
The HCT drop was thought to be secondary to bleeding into his
left thigh after his fracture.  He has a CTA which was negative
for pulmonary embolus and bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds
that did not show clot.  A cortisol stim test was negative for
adrenal insufficiency.  His blood cultures grew Citrobacter
freundii x 2 and coag negative staph x 1; a sputum culture grew
out E Coli.  The cultures were resistant to piperacillin and
ciprofloxacin; the patient was started on cefepime for coverage.

3). Atrial fibrillation with Rapid Ventricul
