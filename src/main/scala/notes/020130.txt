Imaging:
.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2163-10-8**] 6:25 PM
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable CT examination without evidence of
metastatic disease to the brain. Please note that MRI is more
sensitive for detection of such lesions.
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2163-10-8**] 6:02 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or central/segmental
pulmonary embolism. Subsegmental branches within lower lobes
difficult to evaluate due to suboptimal contrast bolus.
2. Dense right lower lobe pneumonia. A few peripheral new
opacities along the right major fissure are also felt to be
infection related. Metastatic disease is felt less likely but
could be reassessed on the next restaging examination.
3. No interval change to previously identified intrathoracic
metastatic disease and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Probable
post-radiation changes involving the left upper lobe.
.
AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2163-10-8**] AT 17:15
IMPRESSION: Consolidation involving the right lower lobe highly
suspicious for pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with
shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension found to have a new
infiltrate on CXR c/w pna.
.
# Sob: She was found to have a pneumonia and initially started
on vanc, zosyn, and levo for broad coverage given her history of
medical care.  Her fever curve decreased over her first days of
admission.  Legionella was negative. Her SOB resolved and the
levo was stopped and she was then covered with vanc and zosyn.
She also had a pleural effusion.  U/S of her thoracic cavity was
done for possible thoracentesis out of concern for empyema.
There was not enough effusion to tap.  She was given albuterol
and atrovent nebulizers.  She continued to improve and she was
afebrile for more than 48 hours before discharge.  Her
antibiotics were transitioned to only po levofloxacin 24 hours
before discharge.  When she remained afebrile and asymptomatic
for 24 hours after switching to PO antibiotics, she was
discharged with instructions to continue the levofloxacin for a
total of 2 weeks of antibiotics.  She already had close follow
up arranged with her oncologist.
.
#.) Hypotension: likely from pneumonia.  Her lisinopril was held
upon admission.  She was briefly on pressors, which were d/c'd
as her blood pressure stabilized.  She was given IVF and
remained stable.  Her lisinopril was restarted on [**2163-10-11**] and
her blood pressure remained stable.
.
#.) h/o LLE DVT: cont. on Lovenox and discharged on 120mg [**Hospital1 **],
her home dose.

arranged with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2163-10-24**].
.
#.) Depression: cont zoloft
.
#.) Hyponatremia: resolved on second day
.
#.) FEN: IVF as above, replete lytes prn, cardiac diet.
.
#.) PPx: PPi, subq heparin, bowel regimen
.
#.) Access- piv, LIJ (d/c'd on [**2163-10-10**]), R port
