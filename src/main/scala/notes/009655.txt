Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a h/o CAD, CHF 20-25%
with apical hypokinesis, who presented with a 5 day history of
shortness of breath. She went to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and was noted to be
in acute heart failure. She was also found to have a troponin of
0.05 with an abnormal EKG and was ASA 325mg, NG, Lasix, and
started on a heparin drip. She never endorsed chest pain. En
route she pulled out both IVs and tried to bite EMS.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.6 64 110/36 22. Her symptoms were
almost resolved. EKG was noted to have STE v1-v4 with TWI in I
and aVL, but were similar comapared to priors on [**4-9**] and
11/[**2185**]. CXR and EKG showed no change compared to that from OSH.
However patient now recognized to be delirious and agitated and
received haldol 2.5IV X2. She was placed in soft restraints.
Cardiology was consulted to review the case, recommended
continuation of heparin. She was initally admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for
heart failure and possible ACS. However, patient then
decompensated with possible flash pulmonary edema, was started
on nitro gtt, 40mg lasix with over 400ml out then continued to
put out. She was delerious requiring restraints. She was placed
on bipap for about one hour, now on NRB and weaning.
.
Of note, she was quite agitated and she received haldol 2.5mg IV
x3 and ativan 0.5 x1 over the night. She had a baseline
dementia, still altered and confused. Baseline mental status was
unclear and her records are in [**Name (NI) 620**]. She also recieved
Morphine 1mg x1 this am, is currently on heparin, nitro gtt.
.
On the floor, patient was on a non-rebreather and denied any
acute complaints.

ECG ([**2187-5-12**] 12:10:38 AM)
Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with associated ST-T wave changes. There
are Q waves in the anterior leads with ST segment elevation in
the anterior and anterolateral leads with terminal T wave
inversion consistent with acute or evolving infarction. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
TRACING #1
.
ECG ([**2187-5-12**] 5:36:38 AM)
Artifact is present. Sinus tachycardia. Left axis deviation.
There are Q waves in the anterior leads with ST segment
elevation in the anterior and nterolateral leads consistent with
acute or evolving infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy with
associated ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of the same date the rate is faster.
TRACING #2
.
ECG ([**2187-5-13**]  10:12:04 AM)
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Left ventricular hypertrophy
with associated ST-T wave changes. There are Q waves in the
anterior leads with ST segment elevation in the anterior and
anterolateral leads with terminal T wave inversion consistent
with acute or evolving infarction. Compared to he previous
tracing of [**2187-5-12**] the rate is slower.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2187-5-12**] 12:00 AM)
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly. Diffusely increased interstitial
markings, likely represent CHF in this setting.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2187-5-15**] 1:26 PM)
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-12**], there is little
overall change. Low lung volumes may contribute to the
prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart. Diffuse
prominence of pulmonary markings bilaterally may be slightly
improved, relating to the diuresis. Although this may represent
elevated pulmonary venous pressure, the possibility of severe
underlying chronic pulmonary disease must be considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old woman with h/o CHF (EF 20-25% in [**11-8**]), CAD s/p MI,
DM, hypothyroidism, and dementia transferred from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
with acute shortness of breath consistent with acute CHF
exacerbation, in house found to be profoundly hypothyroid.

# CHF Exacerbation: Admitted with hypoxemia, requiring
non-rebreather and CXR suggestive of florid pulmonary edema.
Known EF 20-25% and LV thrombus on echo in [**11-8**]. Unclear reason
for decompensation - medication non-compliance vs. ischemia vs.
dietary non-compliance. TSH 58 and hypothyroidism (FT4 0.4) can
lead to worsened diastolic dysfunction so this could be
contributing. Was actively diuresed at first successfully, over
past 24h reacted less to lasix and developed othro-hypo,
Diuresis held [**5-15**] with even goal, [**5-16**] +300cc for 24h, lungs
sound more congested this morning but clinically stable and not
hypoxic. Her metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] was continued. As her blood
pressures and creatinine were stable, home lisinopril 5mg was
started [**5-15**]. She was also put on a cardiac healthy, low Na diet
and her I/Os were targeted to be even. She was gradually weaned
down from 2L delivered via nasal cannulae to O2 sats of the
low-90s on room air. Patient remained euvolemic with no need for
diuresis in house on days preceding discharge. Decision made to
hold diuresis at time of discharge.
.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
- Continue metoprolol XL
- Consider performing echocardiography to reassess functional
status and ejection fraction
- Follow-up with new cardiologist at [**Location (un) 620**]
