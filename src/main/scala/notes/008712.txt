.
[**2189-4-22**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. No acute intra-abdominal abnormality
identified to correlate with patient's pain. Evaluation for
colitis is limited due to absence of oral contrast. 2.
Ill-defined areas of interstitial and airspace opacity at the
lung bases bilaterally may represent infectious or inflammatory
etiologies, but could also be due to motion artifact or
pulmonary edema. 3. Several small focal hypodense areas within
the body and tail of the pancreas, which appear to connect to
the main pancreatic duct, and most likely represent IPMNs.
.
[**4-22**] CT Head: Unremarkable head CT.
.
[**4-22**] CXR: Diffuse reticulonodular interstitial process, without
evidence of heart failure. The chronicity of these findings is
unknown without prior study for comparison but acute
interstitial processes, including infectious etiologies such as
miliary TB or fungus, remain in the differential. Recommend
correlation with patient history, labs, and outside
studies/reports, if available.
.
[**4-22**] R Hip: 1. No fracture or dislocation. 2. Severe right hip
osteoarthritis. 3. Status post left bipolar hip
hemiarthroplasty, partially imaged.
.
[**4-23**] RUQ U/S: 1. No evidence of gallstones. 2. Subcentimeter
hypoechogenic foci within the head and body of the pancreas as
noted on recent CT, of undeterminate etiology.
.
[**4-23**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are  normal. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral
valve prolapse. AT LEAST moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**4-24**] CXR: No significant interval change in the interstitial
process, may be chronic.
.
[**4-24**] MR R Hip: Severe osteoarthritis of the right hip, with
subchondral cyst formation and mild subchondral edema. Minimal
fluid within the hip joint, a
