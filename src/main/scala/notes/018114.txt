History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 70F with severe PVD s/p left BKA [**4-23**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
with pain, redness, and discharge in left stump since Sunday.
Fever to 101F. Pt was in usual state of health until saturday
when the 1 cm ulcer that appears intermeittently on the bottom
of
her otherwise well-healed stump opened up and began to drain
purulent fluid.  On Sunday the stump became firey red and warm
to
touch which prompted her to present to the ED Today. No n/v/c/d.
All other ROS negative.

Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2131-3-13**] at 2:33:04 PM The left
atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe (3+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2131-2-19**] Admitted from home to Vascular Surgery, fever, pain w/ L
below knee amputaion stump erythema and drainage. X-ray
showed-likely a deep ulcer extending to the cortical surface of
the remnant tibial stump. Started broad spectrum antibiotics.
Remained febrile 101.5. Pre-oped for exploration and drainage of
infected L BKA stump. NPO post MN and IV hydration.

[**2131-2-20**] Remained febrile T 102- blood cultures sent. Triggered
for hypotension SBP down to 60's and desaturation down to 88%.
Given NS boluses, responded briefly but continued to become
hypotensive. Transferred to the VICU, more fluid boluses given,
given O2/NC 4l- O2 sats came up to 98-100%. Persistently
hypotensive. Foley inserted, additional preipheral IV access,
central line, a-line placed. Started on Dopamin to keep
SBP>90's. Taken to OR for exploration and drainage of infected L
BKA stump. Post-operatively, remained intubated and sedate,
transferred to CVICU. Presumed to have necrotizing fascitis-
started on Meropenem, Clindamycin and Gentamycin.

Post-operatively the ID team was consulted who recommended
continuing therapy with clindamycin and meropenem, vancomycin
was added in addition. Cultures taken from the operating room
were followed. Daily wound care was performed with wet->dry
dressings TID.
[**2-21**] Dopmaine was required to maintain adquate SBP's.
[**2-22**] Pressors were weaned off, 1 U PRBC transfused and a plastic
surgery consult was obtained.
[**2-23**] The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation,
transitioned from AC to CPAP, a wound VAC was placed over the
left BKA stump.
[**2-24**] The patient was extubated without incident, began spiking
fevers, c-diff was sent along with blood cultures.
[**2-25**] Wound cultures from the OR were positive for beta-hemolytic
strep and MSSA.
[**2-27**] pt with increasing SOB, desaturations, CXR consistent
w/volume overload, diuersis initiated. T-wave inversions noted
on EKG
[**3-2**] Persistently increasing troponins, Cardiac cath, negative
for significant flow limiting coronary lesions. Pt transfered to
VICU
[**3-3**] - [**3-7**]  The patient was progressively diuresed, nutrition
recommendations were obtained and implemented, TTE was repeated
showing improved systolic function (50-55%)
[**3-9**] Pt cleared by cardiology to return to OR for completion AKA
[**3-13**] Pt returned to operating room for above knee amputation
with primary closure. The procedure was without complication.
Chronic pain service continued to follow
[**3-14**] 2 Units PRBC were transfused for a drop in Hct, no obvious
source of bleeding aside from oozing at the amputation site.
Enzymes were cycled to r/o for MI, negative x3. Antibiotics were
continued
[**3-15**] The dressing was taken down, amputation site appeared in
good condition, meropenem was discontinued.
[**3-16**] Pt was deemed fit for discharge. At the time of discharge
pain was well controlled with oral medications, pt was voiding
without difficulty, tolerating a regular diet and working with
physical therapy.
