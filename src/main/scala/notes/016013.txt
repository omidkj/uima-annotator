Vancomycin / Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84 year old male with multiple cardiac risk factors and problems
including IDDM, CAD s/p CABG, ex-smoker, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral
vascular disease presents with nausea/vomiting, rhinorrhea, and
tachycardia for 24 hours.  The patient was in his usual state of
health until yesterday evening when he began to experience a
"horrible runny nose that wouldn't stop".  This was followed by
nausea and vomiting x2.  He denied chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal pain, radiating pain to arms/abdomen/jaw,
lightheadedness, pre-syncope, syncope.  He also denies
orthopnea, PND, increase in abdominal girth or lower extremity
swelling.  On review of systems, the patient reports several
episodes per week where he experiences dizziness,
disorientation, and slight aphasia.  The patient has not seen a
neurologist for these symptoms and they have occurred over the
last 4 years.  Because of his history of cardiac disease, he
decided to seek medical attention immediately for his
nausea/vomiting.

head CT [**2179-11-10**]: 1. No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
Maxillary sinusitis.
2. Low-attenuation focus in the right frontal lobe
periventricular white
matter, likely consistent with an infarct of indeterminant age.
If there is
clinical concern for acute stroke, a MRI with diffusion-weighted
images is
recommended.

[**2179-11-10**] MRA: 1. Extremely faint visualization of flow in the
right vertebral artery.
2. No evidence of stenosis in the right or left carotid
arteries.

[**2179-11-10**] MRI brain:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute ischemia. Multiple chronic
infarcts.

[**2179-11-12**] GI tagged red cell scan:
IMPRESSION: Uptake of tracer in the proximal small bowel,
suggesting active
bleed.

EGD [**2179-11-12**]: Fresh red blood was noted to be oozing from the
second part of the duodenum. Red blood tracked further down the
duodenum, but was most concentrated in the second portion.
Ulcer in the second part of the duodenum (thermal therapy,
injection).
Otherwise normal egd to third part of the duodenum.


Brief Hospital Course:
1.  nausea/vomiting - pt's symptoms initially thought to be
secondary to myocardial ischemia versus viral gastritis versus
cerebrovascular infarct.  Since the patient also complained of
significant rhinorrhea, a viral etiology was favored.  There was
an initial troponin leak of 0.03 but subsequent measurements
were negative for myocardial infarct.  This small leak was
attributed to a component of CHF.
Cardiac ECHO was performed which revealed an EF<20% and severe
global biventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with a
diffuse process (multivessel CAD, toxin, metabolic, etc.)  There
was also a dilated ascending aorta.  Head CT was negative for
acute hemorrhage or mass effect.  There was maxillary sinusitis.
 Stroke and myocardial infarct were ruled out, and then pt's N/V
was managed medically with resolution.

2.  confusion/word finding difficulties - pt was somewhat
confused on admission and had episodes of somnolence over the
first couple of days.  Head CT showed a low-attenuation focus in
the right frontal lobe periventricular white matter, likely
consistent with an infarct of indeterminant age.  To follow up
on that focus, MRI was performed which showed there was no
intracranial mass or shift of normally midline structures.  The
ventricles and basal cisterns were patent and symmetric. There
was no evidence of acute ischemic on diffusion weighted images.
There was, however, an area of chronic ischemia in the right
frontal white matter, with adjacent increased T2 signal
consistent with gliosis.  There were multiple other small foci
of small-vessel ischemic disease in the periventricular white
matter and in the right cerebellum.  The visualized osseous
structures and extracranial soft tissues appeared unremarkable.
General impression was no evidence of acute ischemia, but there
were multiple chronic infarcts.  Pt was somewhat improved by the
time of his transfer to the floor and was back to baseline per
family.

3.  upper gastrointestinal bleed - on the night of [**11-11**], pt was
noted to have melena about 400cc+ x2, with an associated Hct
drop from 38.3 to 28.0.  INR was 2.1 at that time, pt was
hemodynamically stable.  He was given protonix and was scoped
the following morning after a tagged red cell scan showed an
active bleed.  Pt was intubated for the EGD.  There was an ulcer
noted in the second part of the duodenum with fresh red blood
oozing from that area, as well as a protruding vessel in the
area, possibly being a Dieulafoy's lesion.  H pylori serology
was negative.  Hemostasis was achieved.  Surgery consult was
also called - recommended close followup, no intubation at that
time, and aggressive resuscitation.  Pt had been transfused with
8 units PRBCs prior to EGD and did not require any further
transfusions afterwards.  Pt was extubated on [**11-13**] and
transferred to the floor on [**11-14**].  His Hct remained stable
around 30 for the remainder of his hospitalization.  Aspirin
will be held for 2 weeks, coumadin for 4 weeks, and pt will take
[**Hospital1 **] PPI for 2 months, then daily PPI, all per GI recs.  Pt also
does not need to be scoped again, per GI.

4.  atrial fibrillation - The patient reported that he has
chronic atrial fibrillation and has been on coumadin.  He
admitted, however, that he has not seen a cardiologist in 5
years.  He also does not take coumadin regularly or follow up at
coumadin clinic to check his INR.  At admission, INR was
subtherapeutic and he was restarted on coumadin to a
