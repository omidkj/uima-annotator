Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**]
Chief Complaint:
84 year-old female presents as transfer from ED at [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital for severe abdominal pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ex lap, L colectomy, Hartmann's pouch

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 84 year-old female presents as transfer from ED at [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital for severe abdominal pain.  Pain began this AM and was
very sharp and diffuse in nature.  Pain was associated with
vomiting and constipation - she has had only small liquid BMs
over the past day.  Patient has had decreased urinary output
over
the course of the day.  No fevers or chills.  Patient also notes
decreased appetite over the course of this past week. She has
never had pain like this before.  Patient was guaiac positive on
rectal exam at OSH. She underwent CT scan that showed stranding
in LLQ.  Given patient's significant vascular history, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern that she may have mesenteric
ischemia.

[**7-18**]: CTA Abdomen
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Inflammatory change along the descending colon likely due to
acute
diverticulitis. No free air, drainable fluid collection,
pneumatosis, or
portal venous gas. Fluid tracking also along the liver, the
spleen, the
paracolic gutters and into the pelvis. There is diffuse
distention of the
colon, without wall thickening.

2. Atherosclerotic disease with narrowing of the SMA, and with
calcified as
well as noncalcified plaque along the visualized aorta. [**Female First Name (un) 899**] not
definitely
visualized. Status post aortobifemoral graft placement, with
flow
demonstrated through the grafts.

3. Atrophic pancreas with calcifications of the uncinate
probably due to
chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic ductal dilatation and multiple
small
hypodense pancreatic lesions, which may represent side branch
IPMNs.
Recommend MRCP for further evaluation.

4. Subcentimeter likely hyperdense cyst of the left kidney, too
small to
accurately characterize.

5. Fibrotic changes in the visualized lung bases, with
bronchiectasis and
areas of mucus plugging noted in the left lower lobe.


[**7-21**]: MRA head and neck

Multiple small acute infarcts, in the right anterior cerebral
and the
posterior cerebral arterial territories, in the frontal,
parietal, and
occipital lobes likely embolic.

Occlusion of the right common carotid, the cervical and
intracranial portions
of the internal carotid artery, with reformation of the
supraclinoid segment.
Patent anterior and middle cerebral arteries, anterior
communicating,
posterior communicating and arteries of the posterior
circulation.

Please note that the TOF MR angiogram of the head and neck are
technically
limited and hence assessment is limited. A small portion of the
petrous
carotid, on the right side may be patent. However, this can be
further
evaluated with CTA of the head and neck, if considered necessary
for
management. The patient needs vascular/INR consult.

[**7-21**]: CTA Head and neck
1. Approximately 66% stenosis of the right internal carotid
artery with
significant amounts of soft and calcified plaque.
2. Severe atherosclerotic disease throughout the aorta and
bilateral carotid
arteries as described above.
3. Emphysematous changes within the lung. Could consider
dedicated study if
clinically indicated.

[**7-22**]: CT Abd

1. No evidence for abscess.
2. Small amount of fluid in the pericolic gutters and pelvis.
3. Left pleural effusion.
4. Layering of the gallbladder, likely representing small stones
or biliary
sludge.
5. Dilated pancreatic duct and pancreatic cyst, grossly
unchanged from
previous study.

[**7-24**]: Pathology

Colon, segmental resection:



I. Transverse (A-F):

Colonic segment with ischemic colitis demonstrating ulceration,
focally transmural extension and serositis, and involving one of
two resection margins.
No definitive perforation identified.
Three regional lymph nodes with no malignancy identified.
II. Descending (G-J):

Colonic segment with extensive ischemic colitis with focally
transmural necrosis and serositis; ischemic changes extend to
both stapled resection margins.
Two regional lymph nodes with no malignancy identified.
III. Sigmoid (K-P):

Colonic segment with extensive ischemic colitis with focally
transmural necrosis and serositis; ischemic changes extend to
one of two stapled resection margins.
Uninvolved colonic mucosa with hyperplastic changes.
Six regional lymph nodes with no malignancy identified.
IV. Rectal stump (Q-S):

Colonic segment with ischemic colitis with focally transmural
necrosis and serositis.
Viable stapled resection margins demonstrating focal, mild
active colitis.
Note:  The differential includes a vascular insult, certain
infections (e.g. C. difficile) or, less likely, a severe drug
effect. Clinical correlation is suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-19**]: Admitted to SICU under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Cardiac r/o for
bradycardic episodes in ED, Start empiric Cipro/Flagyl, Patient
treated conservatively with NPO, NGT decompression, IVF.  Serial
exams and hematocrits.  Evaluated by vascular surgery. CT scan
shows descending colon diverticulitis w narrowing of SMA and
celiac arteries. Celiac and SMA calcifiction present, however
both opacify w contrast, no intervention required. [**7-21**]
Neurology consulted new onset weakness in her LEFT hemibody
weakness; rec's CTA and MRA, q1h neuro checks.MRI/MRA showed
occlusion of the right common carotid there is string of pearls
sign on DWI suggesting hypoperfusion stroke. Patient evaluated
for possible R CEA by vascular surgery. The patient continued to
have abdominal tenderness throughout her hospital course.
Hematocrits remained stable. On [**7-24**] patient's symptoms
worsened, and given peritoneal signs underwent ex-lap, revealing
ischemic sigmoid colon.Left colectomy, Hartmann procedure,
Transverse colostomy were performed.  Following surgery, patient
was weaned off of sedation but remained unresponsive.  Following
a thorough discussion with the family regarding patient
prognosis and benefits and alternatives to continued treatment,
the family made a decision to withdraw care.  The patient was
changed to comfort measures only and expired at 10:34a on
[**2105-7-25**].
