Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and mechanical ventilation
placement of arterial line
placement of right subclavian central line

History of Present Illness:
A 60 year old gentleman with HIV (on HAART, CD4 323, VL 500s as
of [**11-11**]) transferred from the [**Hospital1 3278**] ED with 4 days of cough,
subjective fever and dyspnea found to be hypoxic and placed on a
non-rebreather at the time of transfer.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.5 83 109/60 16 95 NRB. Patient
was given NS 1L, albuterol, Ceftriaxone and Azithro with Vanc
ordered but not given.  He remained normotensive.
.
On the floor, the patient is awake but clearly working to breath
and difficult to understand because of high flow oxygen.  He
confirms the story above and reports that he is feeling better
overall after interventions thus far.  He endorses dyspnea with
cough but no chest pain, abdominal pain or changes in bowel
habits.  He has not taken any medicines in the past 4 days
including methadone and HAART.  He is currently without pain.
.
Of note, the patient reports variable abdominal distention and
increased neck girth for the past few months.  He reports of a
recent sleep study and a potential "belly test," but is unsure
of the specifics.  Review of his recent records reveals an
abdominal and chest CT which are reported below. There is no
record of sleep study that I could obtain at this time.

CXR: IMPRESSION: New bibasilar consolidative opacities with
peribronchial wall thickening, findings concerning for
pneumonia.
.
CT Scan [**2163-10-26**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Resolution of left lower lobe nodular opacities which may
have been infectious or inflammatory.
2. Widespread areas of ground-glass attenuation within the
lungs, most pronounced in the left upper lobe and both lower
lobes. This is a nonspecific finding but could reflect an
opportunistic infection in this immune compromised patient.
Differential diagnosis includes a noninfectious interstitial
pneumonitis such as NSIP, but this entity is typically more
symmetrical.
3. Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggesting possible pulmonary
arterial hypertension, which can be associated with HIV.
4. Numerous lymph nodes throughout the chest and upper abdomen,
which could be related to generalized lymphadenopathy from HIV,
or could reflect a complication of HIV, such as lymphoma.
5. Coronary artery calcifications.
6. No evidence of acute intraabdominal process.
.
Abd US [**2163-10-25**]: 1. No biliary duct dilatation.
2. No evidence of ascites.
3. Main portal vein patent.
.
EKG: NSR at 85 with RBBB, consistent with [**2155**] EKG.
.
Micro: influenza A positive


Brief Hospital Course:
A 60 year old gentleman with HIV on HAART and new hypoxia, found
to be influenza A positive with radiographic evidence of
pneumonia, with respiratory failure ultimately requiring
intubation and mechanical ventilation.
.
# Respiratory failure/ARDS/H1N1 Influenza:  The patient had
respiratory failure from influenza A with what was believed to
be bacterial superinfection. The patient was a difficult
intubation and was also difficult to wean off of the ventilator.
He had a CT which ruled out PE, and LENIs which ruled out DVT.
He completed a 10 day course of Oseltamivir 150mg PO BID. He
also completed 10/10 days of Vanc and Ceftriaxone, and was
switched to Cefepime [**1-2**]; however, CT chest showed PNA still
present, and due to recurrent fevers, the patient was restarted
on Cefepime and Vancomycin.  The patient continued to have
fevers with negative cultures until he was extubated
successfully [**1-11**]. After that time, his fevers resolved and he
completed his 8 day course of antibiotics without incident. At
the time of discharge, he continued to have a 3L oxygen
requirement.
.
# Pneumonia, Ventilator Associated:  The patient had influenza A
complicated by bacterial superinfection. His influenza was
treated as above.  As noted above, he had persistent fevers and
infiltrates despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. He was thus
started on cefepime and vancomycin.  Bcx, ucx, sputum, and BAL
cultures have all been negative. The only positive cultures grew
out yeast (sputum). Per ID, fevers were believed to be caused by
persistent pneumonia and the patient was re-started on Cefepime
and Vancomycin on [**1-8**] for an 8 day course. Mini-BAL and
cultures were negative other than yeast in the sputum and BAL,
and B-glucan and galactomannin were negative.
.
# Elevated INR/Coagulopathy:  Patient admitted with an elevated
INR likely [**3-7**] nutrition deficit and decreased production of
enteric flora given prolonged antibiotics course.  He was placed
on po Vitamin K x3 days and an INR obtained on [**1-13**] was 1.2.
.
# Agitation/Altered Mental Status: A significant component of
anxiety contributed to the patient's initial respiratory
alkalosis and agitation.  He responded well to seroquel, with
improvement in agitation.  While intubated, he was placed on a
Fentanyl/Versed drip, which was subsequently weaned off. By the
time he was extubated and transferred to the medicine floor, he
was no longer agitated and did not require chemical or physical
restraints.
.
# DM2, poorly controlled without complications: Blood sugars
well controlled on ISS.
.
# HIV, chronic: Patient's HIV currently well controlled although
not on HAART initially due to illness, re-started HAART regimen
as an inpatient.
.
# Abdominal pain/Diarrhea: Although he was admitted with a
complaint of abdominal pain, it resolved spontaneously and no
acute process was shown on abdominal CT scan. Abdominal U/S
showed no biliary duct obstruction and KUB had no evidence of
obstruction.  C.diff negative.  Elevated Lipase was believed to
be [**3-7**] HAART. He did have some diarrhea after extubation that
was thought to be due to his antibiotics. Repeat C. difficile
tests were negative and patient had no other signs or symptoms
of infection.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Initially elevated on admission, Cr
normalized at time of discharge.
 .
# Anemia, chronic disease: Hct is lower than baseline but stable
without recent evidence of bleeding.  His MCV is 80, concern for
iron deficiency anemia.  Hemolysis unlikely w/ normal
haptoglobin.  Iron studies consistent with chronic disease.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Patient's home Atorvastatin was held
initially in the context of  elevated LFT's, but it was
restarted after extubation without incident.
