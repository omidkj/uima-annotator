Chief Complaint:
Drop in HCT and elevated creatinine at rehab

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 87 year-old gentleman with
HTN, diastolic CHF (EF 65% 1/10), AFib not on Coumadin, and mild
AS, Stage IV CKD who comes with a "drop" in his HCT and elevated
creatinine and weight. He has had multiple admissions recently
for acute diastolic heart failure and was discharged to Rehab.
At rehab patient was eating well a "no salt added" food and
feeling well, but nurses noted he was gaining weight (up to 13
pounds as of yesterday). His torsemide was increased to 60 mg
twice a day, but he continued to gain weight. He uses his
regular [**3-3**] pillows, denies any shortness of breath, fever,
chills, rigors. He uses his TEDs in both legs religiously and
has noted mild to moderate swelling of his ankles. His activity
is not impaired and he has good apetite.
.
Patient also complaints of a productive cough with yellow sputum
over the last 1-2 days without SOB, fever, chills rigors,
rashes, joint pains. He reports that he feels fluid dripping in
the back of his trhought without any metal taste or preference
of time of the day. Food does not change it. There is no
rhinorrhea, increased lacrimation, odynophagia, sick contacts.
.
Patient denies any changes in his bowel movement, diarrhea,
constipation
.
Yesterday he had his hematocrit checked and per report it was
very low (unkown value) with guaiac positive stools. Per OSH
report he was very sleepy, but responded to verbal comands and
was oriented x3. In his labs, they also found a creatinine of 3
and Rehab considered that he was too complicated to be managed
there and sent him to the emergency room at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where he
had normal physical exam, stable VS and ECG showing RBBB and
atrial fibrillation without signs of ischemia.
.
In our emergency room  the initial vital signs were: T 96.8 F,
HR 75 [**Doctor First Name **], BP 125/63 mmHg, RR 16 X', SpO2 99% on RA and FSG 74.
Patient look comfortable and well. His SBP fluctuated from
80-120 mmHg. His HCT was at his baseline at 23.5 (HCT on [**3-10**]
was 24), PLT 85, PTT of 35.3 with INR of 1.3 and BUN 103,
creatinine 3.0 and AP 317, Lipase 159. Patient refused NG lavage
and had guaiac positive stools. Given signs of GI bleeding
(guaiac) and borderline low BP patient received 1 unit of RBCs.
Pt was also administered pantoprazole IV. He is admitted to the
ICU for hemodynamic monitoring for possible GIB and hypotension.
His VS were T [**Age over 90 **] F, HR 69 X', BP 94/52 mmHg, RR 18 100%.
