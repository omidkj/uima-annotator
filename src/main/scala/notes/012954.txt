Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was found to have free air on XR in the ED on [**2118-5-21**] and
severe/worsening abdominal pain. She was taken emergently to the
OR for exploratory laparotomy given high concern of bowel
perforation. Intraoperatively she was found to have perforation
of her sigmoid colon. A left colectomy with end colostomy was
performed and the patient was transferred to TICU for post
operative care. On postoperative day 1 she was extubated and her
pain was well controlled on IV medications. She tolerated a
clear liquid diet and was transferred out of the ICU to the east
[**Hospital 18**] campus. On post operative day 2 she was seen by the ostomy
nurse to help teach Mrs. [**Known lastname 100566**] maintenance of the stoma/ostomy
and she voided without difficulty (the Foley having been removed
at midnight the pervious evening. At that time her Zosyn was
discontinued and IV vancomycin was maintained.
On POD3 she was noted to have HR into the 150s and sporadically
back down to the 80s. During this time she was asymptomatic
w/good mentation, no pains (chest or otherwise), and without
complaints. Given her cardiac history, cardiac enzymes were
sent, a EKG was performed (Afib but largely
unremarkable/unchanged). Additionally, geriatrics was consulted
for help managing her rampant Afib and hypertension. Her HR was
managed with her home regimen of metoprolol with IV metoprolol
as needed for tachycardia. She continued to have intermittent
periods of SVT and cardiology was consulted on POD 4. Her
cardiac enzymes were normal and cardiology recommended
continuing to titrate her Lopressor, iv Lopressor prn,
diltiazem, and echo. A TTE was performed the next day and
demonstrated normal cardiac function without significant wall
motion abnormalities.
On POD4 it was also noted that Mrs.[**Last Name (un) 100567**] WBC was continuing
to rise/remain elevated in the mid/high 20s. At this point she
began making stool from her ostomy that was very liquidy and was
occurring in large volumes. A cidff was sent and she was started
empirically on Flagyl. On POD 5 her WBC was 28.0 and she
continued to have large ostomy output. ID was consulted and
recommended broad spectrum coverage with Linezolid IV for VRE
coverage from intraoperative culture, Zosyn IV, Flagyl, and
Vancomycin by mouth for treatment of presumed Cdiff. The
patient's condition continued to improve, however the white
blood cell count was slow to respond to antibiotic treatment.
All culture data blood and urine failed shed any light on a
source of infection. On [**2118-5-25**] a CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis was preformed and other than post-operative changed, was
stable. The white blood cell count failed to improve. A PICC
line was placed on [**2118-5-27**] for continued IV antibiotic therapy.
All chest films failed to show a pneumonia. On [**2118-5-27**], the
patient had minimal colostomy output, however on CT scan had
stool in colon, the stoma was irrigated with good result, she
was started on a regular diet with ensure supplements which was
tolerated well. An additional CT scan of the abdomen was
preformed on [**2118-5-31**] which again showed no intraabdominal
infectious process however, the patient had developed left
hip/thigh pain and the upper [**12-20**] of the thigh was included in
this CT scan which showed new large intramuscular hematoma in
the left medial anterior thigh which did not appear to be
infected. Because of this new finding, a lower extremity
ultrasound was preformed which was negative for DVT. The
patient's hematocrit had dropped from 29.4 to 24.4, and because
of her rapid atrial fibrillation she was transfused two units.
Her repeat hematocrit was 29. The patient was evaluated by
