Chief Complaint:
Feeling unwell

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IJ CVL placement

History of Present Illness:
40 yo male with history of heroin abuse, Hepatitis C, and
recently diagnosed diabetes mellitus who presented to an OSH as
he was feeling unwell.  He reports a recent diagnosis of
diabetes, after classic symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, and
20lb weight loss with thrush of his oral cavity and his
genitalia.  He then reports fevers, nausea, nonbloody bilious
vomiting, myalgais, and rash on his left ankle over the past few
days.  He was feeling unwell so he tried to treat his diabetes
by having carbohydrates, so he had multiple popsicles and liters
of soda.  This did not help his symptoms so his brother brought
him to [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital.

At the OSH, he reportedly presented with a heroin overdose and
was lethargic on their initial exam.  He initially responded to
narcan with return to baseline mental status.  He was noted to
have a blood sugar of 1200.  He was given 1L of fluid and
started on insulin drip and vancomycin given concern for
celluitis because of several erythematous areas on his body.
Enroute per EMS patient became more altered and started having
hallucinations.  OSH labs: K 2, Bicarb 13, Cr 1.8, Osm 336,
serum tox positive for opiates otherwise negative, urine ketones
positive.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as there were no ICU beds
available at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

On arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], he complained of being extremely thristy.
He admits to heroin abuse today.  He also reported SI.  He
states he was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but has
continued to eat a high carbohydrate diet at home. Initial V/S
on arrival: 140 28 109/52 100% on RA. A right IJ was placed.
This was confirmed on CXR w/ no obvious PTX.  He was given 4L
IVF NS, and 1L with potassium.  He received 15units of insulin
and then an insulin drip at 12 units/hour.  Mental status A&Ox3.
 V/S prior to transfer: 98.6 136 149/73 28 100% on RA.

On arrival to the MICU, he is thirsty, hungry, and notes left
ankle pain.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other
fungi.

      STAPHYLOCOCCUS LUGDUNENSIS.    SECOND MORPHOLOGY.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after

         This isolate is presumed to be resistant to clindamycin
based on
         the detection of inducible resistance .
