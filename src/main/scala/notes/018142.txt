Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
syncope, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2167-1-24**] - Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
75 yo M with metastatic gallbladder cancer on gemzar/cisplatinum
(last dose [**2167-1-16**]), bladder cancer s/p cystectomy, recent
admissions for partial SBO ([**1-5**] - [**1-7**]) and for biliary
obstruction ([**1-20**] - [**1-22**]) now presenting with hypotension,
nausea, vomiting.
.
The patient was admitted [**Date range (1) 30498**]/12 following ERCP, performed
due to biliary obstruction. During the ERCP, diffuse ulceration
was noted in the distal esophagus, at the GE junction, and in
the body of the stomach. Cannulation of the biliary duct was
initially difficult but was successful and deep after placement
of a 5 mm x 5 FR pancreatic stent. A 12 mm long segment of
severe narrowing was noted at the level of the hilum consistent
with a stricture. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire. A WallFlex TM biliary RX uncovered 8 mm x 80 mm stent
(REF: 7062, LOT: [**Numeric Identifier 93920**]) was placed successfully. The
pancratic stent was removed after placement of the metal stent.
.
ERCP was complicated by nausea, vomiting, and elevated lipase.
The patient was treated with bowel rest and IV fluids, and his
diet was advanced prior to discharge on [**2167-1-22**]. Hospital course
was also notable for new diagnosis of bilateral DVTs for which
patient was started on lovenox treatment.
.
Yesterday, the patient developed weakness, nausea, and vomiting.
He estimates that he had 10 episodes of non-bloody emesis. He
also had some black diarrhea overnight last night. Then, at 3
a.m., the patient awoke with nausea and vomiting. He spent the
next couple of hours sitting on a couch, during which time he
experienced shaking chills and also syncopized for a couple of
minutes. He regained consciousness and his family helped him to
the toilet, at which point he had no BM had more syncope, and
his family called EMS. When EMS arrived, initial BP was 70s/40s.
.
The patient also complains of cough and the sensation fo being
unable to take a deep breath, which started during his recent
admission. He has had hiccups for several weeks now, and has
been taking baclofen twice daily for this.
.
In the ED, initial vitals signs were T 98.4 BP 73/37 HR 122 RR
16 Sat 93%.  Exam was significant for AOx2, course breath sounds
bilaterally.  Patient was bolused with IVF.  Labs were notable
for WBC 6.9 (73N, 15bands), Hct 34 (27 at discharge), platelets
1000 (588 at discharge), Cr 1.4 (0.7 at discharge), ALT 16, AST
15, AP 675 (627 at discharge), Tbili 2.5 (2.2 at discharge),
lactate 5.1, UA w 83 WBCs, positive nitrites, few bacteria.  CXR
demonstrated new L basilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural
effusion. Patient was started on vanco/cefepime for presumed
HCAP. LIJ was placed for fluid resuscitation.  Patient remained
hypotensive in SBP 80s, requiring initiation of levophed.  ED
course otherwise notable for patient reporting abdominal pain.
CT abd/pelvis demonstrated known tumor, mildly distended
stomach, with some fluid in the lower esophagus, could relate to
partial gastric antral obstruction in the presence of
symptoms. CT abd/pelvis also showed pleural effusion, ascites,
improved left hydronephrosis. Repeat lactate returned 2.1. At
time of transfer, patient had received 4L IVF and had a LIJ and
two peripheral 18 gauge IVs.  Vital signs on transfer were 98.5
HR119 BP85/50, RR34 98%3L.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient complained of heartburn and
abdominal bloating. His nausea had resolved. He had the
sensation of needing to defecate. However, he did not pass any
stool.
.
Review of systems: No fever. +chills. +cough and dyspnea. No
chest pain. +syncope. +abdominal discomfort and bloating,
increased from baseline. Urine has been darker than usual. Has
urinary ostomy. +hiccups. No rash. No focal weakness. +Chronic
bilateral toe tingling L>R. No visual changes.

ONCOLOGY HISTORY
- [**2158**] - cystoprostatectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7391**] revealed bladder
TCC invading the lamina propria involving intravesicular portion
of the left ureter
- [**2165**] - resection for local recurrence.
- [**10/2166**] - CT abdomen w hypodense liver lesion and mesenteric
band-like nodularity in the right upper quadrant concerning for
peritoneal carcinomatosis, pleural thickening along the
ascending colon.
- [**11/2166**] - colonoscopy w severe narrowing at the hepatic flexure
[**12-25**] extrinsic compression, CT torso and MRCP demonstrated
regular hypoenhancing mass centered within the gallbladder fossa
and
infiltrating portions of the right and left hepatic lobes,
extending to hepatic flexure most c/w gallbladder cancer, also w
loss of intervening fat plane between the extension of the tumor
out of the liver and the hepatic flexure and duodenal bulb,
intrahepatic bile duct dilation, extrinsic compression of the
hepatic duct, and enhancing soft tissue nodules in the greater
omentum consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
- [**2166-12-30**] - CT-guided liver biopsy carcinoma with clear cell
features diffusely positive for cytokeratin cocktail and
cytokeratin 7 and negative for Hep Par 1 packs 2 TTF-1,
cytokeratin 20 and P63 most compatible with a tumor of biliary
pancreatic or upper gastrointestinal origin
- [**2167-1-5**] - KUB partial small-bowel obstruction
- [**2167-1-9**] - Gemzar/cisplatin started
- [**2167-1-20**] - Presentation w abd pain and elevated bilirubin,
ERCP w 12mm long segment of severe narrowing, sphincterotomy and
placement of WallFlex TM biliary RX uncovered stent
