HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old man with
past medical history significant for congestive obstructive
pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, status post CABG
in [**2168**], hypertension, peripheral vascular disease,
congestive heart failure, high cholesterol, and atrial
fibrillation status post DDD pacer who presents with a seven
day history of increasing malaise, shortness of breath, and
insomnia.  According to his children, the patient lives alone
and is independent in shopping, activities of daily living,
etc, but the Saturday prior to admission, the patient
complained of increased depression and insomnia as well as
difficulty breathing.

On Wednesday morning, the patient called his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**]
increased his Zoloft to 100 mg q day and started Ativan to
aid in sleep.  On Thursday, in conversation with the son, the
patient had noticeably increased shortness of breath (though
could not speak in complete sentences), and he appeared "not
himself."  Friday the son saw him again, and stated the
patient "appeared pale and weak", and was not clear he was
eating or drinking anything.

The patient finally called EMS on the morning of admission
and never complained at any time of chest pain or abdominal
pain.  The children had noticed no increased edema or weight
gain.  The patient did, however, have an increased cough.  In
the Emergency Department, the patient was very somnolent with
an arterial blood gas of 7.24, 73, and 118.  The patient also
appeared dehydrated.  He was given fluid, started on BiPAP to
decrease his CO2.  At baseline, his CO2 appears to be 50 or
60 per past arterial blood gases.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Coronary artery disease status post five vessel CABG in
[**2168**].
3. Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral
aortobifemoral bypass.
4. Hypertension.
5. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. History of gastrointestinal bleed secondary to AVMs.
8. History of congestive heart failure.
9. History of atrial fibrillation status post DDD pacemaker.
Catheterization in [**2168**] showed three vessel disease, moderate
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, mild left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, left main 40%, left anterior descending
artery diffuse 95% at the diag, left circumflex 60% after
OM-2, 70% at origin of OM-2, right coronary artery diffuse
90% at mid portion, ejection fraction of 50% with 1+ mitral
regurgitation.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had no allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin EC 225 mg.
2. Atenolol 25 mg.
3. Azmacort four puffs [**Hospital1 **].
4. Ipratropium six puffs [**Hospital1 **].
5. Isordil 10 mg tid.

Retired postmaster.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His examination revealed a somnolent
patient.  Mucous membranes dry.  Lungs:  Bilateral coarse
breath sounds anteriorly.  No edema in the extremities,
guaiac positive per Emergency Department.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Rapid atrial flutter.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was immediately admitted to the
CCU from the Emergency Department due to his arterial blood
gas and his requirement for BiPAP.  The patient returned to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on [**2176-2-26**] after his stay in the MICU.  The
patient was diagnosed to have rapid atrial flutter and
congestive obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and
ruled in while in the CCU.  The patient was begun on Heparin
for atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction.  The
patient did revert to normal sinus rhythm.

For his congestive obstructive pulmonary disease, the patient
was given steroids and azithromycin as well as nebulizers.
For the atrial flutter, EP planned to do an ablation on
[**2176-2-29**].  The patient was not taken to cardiac
catheterization.  The myocardial infarction from his troponin
rose to 6 at its peak was most likely secondary to increased
demand from the congestive obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation and the rapid atrial fibrillation.

The patient's congestive heart failure exacerbation continued
to improve throughout the hospital course.  The patient
became more alert, awake, and animated.  The patient was sent
to rehab in stable condition at the end of the admission in
order to transition to a long-term placement rather than
living alone any longer.  The patient was sent to
rehabilitation.
