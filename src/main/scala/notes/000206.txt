Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4891**]
Chief Complaint:
Ureteral stone

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Interventional radiology placed right percutaneous nephrostomy
tube

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old female with PMH HTN,
Hyperlipidemia, CAD, is transferred from [**Hospital 8125**] [**Hospital 6136**]
Hospital for hypotension and sepsis after presenting with
nausea/vomiting and flank pain and found to have a large right
uretral stone.
.
According to the patient, she was experiencing nausea/vomiting
with bilateral flank pain and "tightness" radiating to the groin
(she is unable to assign another quality to the pain). The pain
was constant and became progressively worse over 2 days, she
developed confusion on the day of admission. She presented to
[**Hospital 8125**] hospital where she was hypotensive to SBP 80-90 and
tachycardic to 120, she was given 3L IVNS and started on
peripheral phenylephrine. Initial labs were remarkable for WBC
60 with 40% bands, Creatinine 3.3 (baseline unknown though last
in [**Hospital1 18**] records is 0.5 in [**2141**]), AST 70, ALT 50, INR 1.3,
Lactate 4.5. She had a CT head which was negative for acute
hemorragic stroke, CT abdomen/pelvis revealed bilateral
nephrolithiasis with a 5mm stone located in the right ureter
without evidence of hydronephrosis. She was given Zosyn 3.73g
IV, Vanco 1gm IV, Magnesium 1gm, Zofran 4mg IV and Morphine 4mg
IV. Given hypotension and sepsis, she was transported by
[**Location (un) **] to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.
.
Patient was received in the ED on phenylephrine with initial
vitals
HR 120, BP 123/67 RR 28, 98% on NRB, 89% on RA. A right IJ CVL
was placed with initial CVP 7-10. She was given another 3L IVNS
(total 6L IVNS including those given at OSH), and phenylephrine
was weaned with SBP 110/50. Labs were remarkable for WBC 43.1,
94% PMN, Plt 132, BUN/Cr 37/3.0, K 3.0, HCO3 20, with AG 15, mg
1.5, Lactate 2.4, TropT: 0.09, CK 119, UA was grossly positive
with 140 WBCs and 20 RBC. She again became hypotensive to 98/56,
CVP 15mmHg, Phenylephrine was resumed. O2 saturation remained
mid 90's on NRB, attempts to wean were unsuccessful. Urology was
consulted who recommended clinical stabilization prior to
intervention and admission to the [**Hospital Ward Name **]. She was given
magnesium 2g prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she reports chest "tightness" that she
feels when she needs to use her pumps for asthma, stating that
the pain is different from her anginal equivalent which is back
pain. She reports that the abdominal/flank pain was alleviated
by morphine at [**Hospital 8125**] hospital and has not returned.

IMAGING:
CT Head [**Hospital 8125**] hospital [**2151-1-10**]-  Negative head CT

CT Abdomen/pelvis  [**Hospital 8125**] hospital [**2151-1-10**]
1. Bilateral nephrolithiasis 7mm calculus in the proximal right
ureter with no significant
2. Colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis
3. bilateral lower lung consolidation which is non-specific
4. fat deposition in the liver

EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 120 bpm, normal axis, no pathologic Q
waves, and 1mm STD in v3-v6, compared with tracing [**2142-1-4**]
tachycardia and STD are new (Medicine PGY2 read).

Portable Chest Xray [**2151-1-10**]
IMPRESSION: Right IJ central venous catheter tip in a low
position.
Retraction by at least 6 cm is advised for more appropriate
positioning.
Persistent mild vascular congestion and bibasilar atelectasis.

Portable Chest Xray [**2151-1-10**]
Right internal jugular line has been pulled back to the distal
SVC. Mild
edema still present in both lungs along with mild cardiomegaly
and mediastinal vascular engorgement. More discrete
consolidation in the right lower lung, where there is also a
clear atelectasis, and in the infrahilar left lower lobe could
be due to concurrent pneumonia.

TTE [**2151-1-11**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
