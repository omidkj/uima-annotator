CXR:
[**2113-2-5**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Lung volumes have minimally decreased. The pre-existing
massive
bilateral parenchymal opacities, predominating at the right lung
base and the left lung apex are unchanged. Also unchanged is the
accompanying right basal pleural effusion. Traces of gas in the
right lateral soft tissues have completely resolved. There is no
evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
[**2113-2-1**]: There is a subsequent increase in severity of the
pre-existing massive parenchymal opacities, predominating at the
left lung
apex and the right lung base. No opacities have newly appeared.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Slightly
decreasing is the large right lateral chest wall air inclusion.

Chest CT: [**2113-1-30**]
1. Status post right lower lobe lobectomy and right upper lobe
posterior
segmentectomy.
2. Acute pulmonary embolism originating at the ligated right
lower lobe
pulmonary artery extending into the right middle lobe pulmonary
artery.
3. Diffuse bilateral honeycombing which is new since [**12-6**].
4. Right hydropneumothorax and pneumothorax.
5. Right-sided subcutaneous edema.

Echo: [**2113-1-31**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the basal inferior
septum, akinesis of the basal inferior free wall, and dyskinesis
of the basal posterior wall. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] was taken to the operating room on [**2113-1-26**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for right thoracoscopy, right thoracotomy and right
lower lobectomy with en bloc right upper lobe posterior
segmentectomy, mediastinal lymph node dissection, and
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, for a right upper lobe
mass. The patient recovered in the PACU, extubated, on nasal
cannula, with IV fluid and PCA dilaudid for pain, along with
foley catheter and right chest tube to water seal with
intermittent leak. He was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9 in stable
condition.

Neuro: The patient was initially on dilaudid PCA for pain which
was transitioned to oral tylenol, dilaudid, tizanidine. He
required IV medicine for breakthrough, including toradol on POD
3. On POD 4, tizandine was increased but stopped secondary to
hypotension and dilaudid changed to oxycodone with good control.
Over the course of his stay his pain medication was titrated and
he was discharged on oxycodone and acetaminophen.

Pulmonary: Serial chest xrays were done. The chest tube was
discontinued POD3. Aggressive pulmonary toilet with nebulizers
and mucolytics along with lasix, were continued for lung
opacification which had appearance of infection vs.
inflammation. Despite optimum medical management on the floor
the patient became increasingly hypoxic and confused on
[**2113-1-30**]. He developed respiratory failure with oxygen
saturations of 70% 6L NC. A CTA revealed right middle lobe
pulmonary embolus. Heparin drip was started. He was transferred
to the ICU for further management and observation.  On 60%
Hi-flow FM  With aggressive pulmonary toilet,nebs, incentive
spirometer and good pain control he titrated off supplemental
oxygen with room air saturations of 92-94% with ambulation and
at rest.

Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia 100-120's and lopressor was
titrated.  On [**2-1**] he had brief episode of atrial fibrillation
150's with hypotension. Unresponsive to diltiazem and lopressor.
With Amiodarone bolus and drip he converted to sinus rhythm 80,
hemodynamically stable. Lopressor was continued, amiodarone
stopped secondary pulmonary side effect.  He remained in sinus
rhythm the lopressor was changed to Atenolol 50 mg daily. Blood
pressure stable 100-120's.

Renal: Foley removed [**2113-1-27**]. Failed to void, bladder scan for
540 foley re-inserted and flomax started. Foley removed [**1-30**] he
voided without difficulty. Renal function normal with good urine
output.  Electrolytes repleted as needed

GI: He advanced to a diabetic diet. Bowel regime & PPI were
continued.

Endocrine: insulin sliding scale with blood sugars < 150.

ID: Emperic Vancomycin and Cefipime were started [**2113-1-31**] but
discontinued on [**2113-2-2**] since he had no fevers or leukocytosis.

Heme: he was started on Heparin bridge to Warfarin on [**2113-1-31**].
Initial dose 5 mg
x 2 days with INR of 2.7, held for 2 days and restarted [**2-6**]
with 4 mg.  INR [**2-7**] was 2.4 he was discharged on 2 mg warfarin
daily.  He will follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Last Name (STitle) 87533**] on Thursday
for further warfarin instructions.

Disposition: he was seen by physical therapy who deemed him safe
for home with a walker and PT.  He was discharged on [**2113-2-7**] to
home with his family.
