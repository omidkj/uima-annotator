Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 yo w/DM, recent admit for nec fasc, who presents
with sepsis, GPC bacteremia, likely due to skin & soft tissue
infection of LLE and perineum. Given that organism (GPC in
chains, likely strep) has been isolated in blood, recommend
continuing meropenem and vancomycin for broad GPC/GNR coverage,
and adding clindamycin to optimize anti-toxin effect. Would stop
flagyl & fluconazole soon,
as meropenem covers anaerobes, and no evidence of fungal
infection.

His PICC, given demonstrated bacteremia, was removed and grew
BETA STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP C.

Sepsis: He was on pressors for hypotension. His initial exam was
notable for foul odor, beefy soft tissue in wound, and light
crepitus over L med thigh. CT showed no gas or fluid collection.
He continued on ABX as stated above. ID was consulted and
following along and eventually he was switched to Penicillin G
for 14 days. A new PICC was placed on HD 5 and he will complete
his ABX course at rehab.

Necrotizing Fasciitis: His LLE and Left groin continued with
dressing changes. The Celulitis improved and the wound was
healing with beefy, red granulation tissue. Plastics deffered
grafting at this time until the cellulitis resolved and he was
off antibiotics.

Heme: He was anticoagulated for history of PE. He was
supertherapeutic on admission and Coumadin was held and INR
drifted down to a therapeutic range. Coumadin was restarted when
appropriate.

Renal: His Lasix was restarted when appropriate to help with
diuresis.

He was discharge to rehab and will continue with ABX and PT.
