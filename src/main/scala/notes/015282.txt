History of Present Illness:
65 year old male with known
coronary disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery in [**2137**]. He is an active smoker and has severe COPD
confirmed by PFT and recent CT scan. On his recent CT scan,
there
was an incidental finding of a focal aneurysmal outpouching of
his ascending aorta along with a left lingula mass. Further
review by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] thought it looked like a penetrating
atherosclerotic plaque that had ulcerated and that it was only
covered by a very thin aortic wall and thus was at risk for
rupture. Given the above findings, he was referred for surgical
evaluation. Had left thoracentesis for one liter of pleural
fluid yesterday by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22882**], with some improvement in
breathing, but has continued cough.

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-11-15**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque.. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2151-11-15**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Three vessel coronary disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD, RIMA-PDA, SVG-D1. Occluded SVG-OM1, SVG-OM2.

3. Graft position obtained for repair of thoracic aortic
aneurysm.

Reason: check L effusion
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   66 year old man s/p thoracentesis, aortic stent
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   check L effusion

Final Report
INDICATION: 66-year-old man status post thoracentesis, aortic
stent, check
left effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2151-11-17**]; [**2151-11-9**]; CT of [**9-28**], [**2151**].

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Median sternotomy wires are unchanged. An
aortic stent is
in place. Heart size is probably normal, although obscured. The
aorta is
calcified and mildly tortuous. Hilar contours are normal. There
is a
persistent small right and small-moderate left effusion. Round
atelectasis in
the left mid lung persists, stable from the pre-operative study
and CT of
[**2151-9-28**]. There is no pneumothorax. Upper lungs are
clear.
Surgical clips are seen.

Overall unchanged.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2151-11-15**] for surgical
management of his thoracic aortic arch aneurysm. He was taken to
the operating room where he underwent endostenting of his aortic
aneurysm as well as left subclavian to left common carotid
artery bypass and a left common carotid to right common carotid
artery
bypass. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively
he was taken to the intesnive care unit for monitoring. Given
his severe COPD, he was slow to extubate. Eventually he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated.  The Otolaryngology
service was consulted for a hoarse voice however his voice
returned without issue. The thoracic surgery service was
consulted for a large recurrent pleural effusions. A left
thoracentesis was performed which drained 1500cc's of fluid.
Multiple studies were sent on the fluid. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to
make steady progress and was discharged [**Last Name (un) **] on [**2151-11-19**]. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**],
his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an
outpatient.
