.
PORTABLE CXR [**11-4**] (WET READ): no acute process
.
SPIROMETRY [**2160-2-26**]:
Mechanics: The FVC is mildly to moderately reduced. The FEV1 and
FEV1/FVC ratio are markedly reduced.
Flow-Volume Loop: Marked expiratory coving with a moderately
reduced volume excursion.
.
Impression:
Severe obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC is likely
due to gas trapping given the normal TLC measured on [**2150-9-10**].
Compared to that study the FVC has decreased by 1.27 L (-38%)
and the FEV1 has decreased by 0.96 L (-62%).
.
Echo: [**11-5**]
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-9-18**],
suboptimal images on current study, but overall findings are
similar with normal left ventricular size and systolic function.
Hypertrophied moderately dilated right ventricle with mildly
depressed systolic function.
.
[**11-7**] CT chest:
1. Emphysema. Bilateral pleural effusion. No PE. Stable lung
nodules. CT
chest followup is recommended in one year to document two-year
stability, if clinically warranted.
2. Ascites.
3. Hypodensity in the right liver lobe, not fully characterized
on the
current scan, and in similar appearance compared to prior study.
If further clinical correlation is needed, ultrasound can be
done.
4. Cystic lesion at the left kidney
.
[**11-7**] CXR
Peribronchial opacification in the right lower lobe persists,
less severe
abnormality on the left has improved. Progression suggests
aspiration,
developing into right lower lobe pneumonia. ET tube is in
standard placement. Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out
of view. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size is
normal.
.
[**11-11**] CXR
Continued improvement in the perihilar infiltrates with no new
consolidation or pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
# COPD EXACERBATION: Pt was admitted to the Medical ICU due to
increased dyspnea, productive cough, and tachypnea on
presentation.  CXR did not show infiltrate.  However, as the
patient had increased work of breathing, altered mental status
and tachypnea, he was intubated on [**11-4**]. ABGs were consistent
with hypercarbic respiratory failure.  He was started on high
dose methylprednisolone 125 mg IV q6 hours. He was ruled out for
influenza and was treated initially for HAP with vancomycin /
cefepime.  However, this was narrowed to vancomycin after
culture data returned with GPCs in sputum.  He completed an 8
day course of Vancomycin and was treated with standing albuterol
and ipratroprium.  Bronchoscopy was performed without
complication. The patient was extubated on [**11-11**].  and required
Bipap for most of the day of extubation and day after
extubation.  He was weaned to BIPAP overnight only and was
transferred to the floor on oral prednisone, inhalers.  His O2
goal is 88-93% which he maintains at 2 L NC.  He requires Bipap
on overnight.  His baseline respiratory rate is in the mid 30s.

On the medicine floor from [**Date range (1) **], pt was continued on oral
prednisone and received albuterol/atrovent nebs every 6hrs. Pt
was notably tachypneic with minimal exertion but denied
significant worsening in SOB. He maintained mental status at
baseline and required BIPAP overnight as well as intermittently
during the day while napping.  Due to concern for increased
wheezing, IV steroids were re-started and should continued for
an additional day ([**11-20**]).  He should be monitored during his
wean to oral prednisone and continued on a slow taper as
outlined in the medication regimen.  Of note, pt should resume
Advair and Tiotropium inhalers when he is no longer requiring
Albuterol/Atrovent nebs every 6hrs.

# HYPOTENSION: Pt had transient hypotension in the setting of
intubation with succ/etomidate and sedation. Pt
