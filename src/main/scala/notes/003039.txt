Service:  MICU

ADENDUM TO PREVIOUS DISCHARGE SUMMARY DATED [**2119-9-17**].
Therefore, this dictation covers events from [**2119-9-18**], to
[**2119-9-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory failure - Due to the patient's intercurrent
illnesses and diminished lung reserve, it was felt by the
MICU team that he would take a prolonged period of time to
extubate.  Therefore, he underwent tracheostomy placement on
[**2119-9-19**].  The patient tolerated this procedure well.  In the
interim, he was continued on a regimen of Atrovent and
Albuterol meter dose inhalers.  He underwent aggressive
pulmonary toilet and chest physical therapy.  Overall, he
tolerated tracheostomy procedure well.  At the time of
discharge, the patient was being weaned slowly from
ventilation settings, mainly by decreasing his positive and
expiratory pressure requirement.  He had several trach collar
trials. He will be continued on a weaning regimen after
discharge to the rehabilitation facility with the ultimate
goal of having the patient off mechanical ventilation.

2.  Hypotension - As outlined in the previous dictation
summary on [**2119-9-16**], the patient became profoundly
hypotensive.  It was unclear at that time if the patient was
suffering from sepsis versus intravascular volume depletion
from another cause.  As the patient was exhibiting signs of
auto PEEP on vent settings, esophageal balloon studies were
performed to ascertain his intravascular volume setting.  The
results of these studies were indicative of decreased
intravascular volume.  In light of the patient's hemodynamic
instability, his antihypertensive medications of Metoprolol
and Captopril were held.  He was bolused aggressively with
intravenous fluids.  He transiently required Levophed to
maintain systolic blood pressure in the 120 to 130 systolic
range.  After intravenous fluid resuscitation, the patient's
blood pressure stabilized.  At the time of discharge, the
patient's pressure actually tended to be hypertensive.  He
was restarted on Metoprolol and the dose at the time of
discharge was titrated up to a level of 75 mg three times a
day.  In the outpatient setting, the patient's blood pressure
should be continually monitored with antihypertensive
medications titrated to maintain systolic blood pressure in
the 120 to 130 systolic range.

3.  Recurrent bacteremia - In light of the patient's acute
hypotension on [**2119-9-16**], he was pancultured.  Blood cultures
from that date grew two out of four bottles with coagulase
positive Staphylococcus aureus.  Sensitivities on this
organism revealed it to be Oxacillin sensitive.  While
waiting for sensitivities, the patient was started
empirically on Vancomycin over concern for possible
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus sepsis.  Although
the cultures ended up growing Oxacillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus, this was a concern as the patient had
been on Oxacillin at the time of culture.  He had actually
already received three to four days of Oxacillin therapy for
his previous Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus to
tracheobronchitis during this same hospitalization.  In light
of the patient's recurrent bacteremia of Oxacillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus while he was on Oxacillin, infectious
disease service was consulted.  The infectious disease
service recommended discontinuing Vancomycin and continuing
Oxacillin therapy.  A source of the patient's recurrent
bacteremia was aggressively sought.  His right subclavian
central venous line was discontinued.  Culture from the
patient's right subclavian line catheter tip failed to grow
any organism.  He underwent transthoracic echocardiogram
which was negative for vegetations or any evidence of
endocarditis.  He also underwent transesophageal
echocardiogram which was also negative for any evidence of
endocarditis or vegetations.  Surveillance cultures dated
[**2119-9-18**], [**2119-9-21**], [**2119-9-22**], all exhibited no growth at the
time of this dictation.  Urine culture was also negative.
Sputum culture and gram stain demonstrated greater than 25
polymorphonuclear cells, 0 epithelial cells.  No
microorganism was identified on sputum gram stain.
Respiratory culture demonstrated rare growth of oropharyngeal
flora. Therefore, the patient completed a second seven day
course of Oxacillin. At the time of discharge, all
surveillance cultures were negative.  The patient's white
blood cell count had normalized. He was afebrile.

4.  Acute renal failure - The patient demonstrated an acute
elevation in his creatinine level from his baseline of 0.7 up
to a value of 1.4 to 1.5.  Concern was for prerenal
intravascular volume depletion versus acute tubular necrosis
which might have occurred during his period of hypotension on
[**2119-9-16**].  There was also concern that the patient might be
exhibiting a renal insult secondary to his Oxacillin therapy.
Urine eosinophils study was negative.  The patient's urine
was spun and sediment examined demonstrating red blood cells,
granular casts.  There is no evidence of any muddy brown
casts indicative of acute tubular necrosis.  Urine
electrolyte analysis was suggestive of a prerenal state.  In
light of this, the patient's Captopril was held in order to
prevent further renal insult.  His medications were renally
dosed.  Albumin at a dose of 25 grams intravenously twice a
day was used to expand his intravascular volume.  He
demonstrated good urine output with albumin therapy.  At the
time of discharge, his creatinine remained at values ranging
from 1.4 to 1.5 consistently.  Upon discharge to
rehabilitation facility, the patient's creatinine should be
frequently monitored.

5.  Fluid, electrolytes, nutrition - In light of the
patient's prolonged hospitalization and complicated
illnesses, he is unable to tolerate oral feedings.
Throughout his hospital course, he was maintained on tube
feeds via nasogastric or orogastric tubes.  He underwent
percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement on [**2119-9-26**].  He
tolerated this procedure well without any complications.
Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
placement, the patient's tube feeds were reinstated.  At the
time of discharge, he was tolerating them well.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair. Oxygenation saturation stable
on current ventilator settings.  Attempting to wean the
patient off ventilator via decreasing PEEP requirement and
daily trach collar trial.  Renal function stabilized at a

gastrostomy tube feeds.  Transesophageal echocardiogram and
blood cultures negative.
