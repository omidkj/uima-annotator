Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**3-5**]
at OSH:  percutaneous biliary tube placement, cholecystectomy,
Rt sided AKA

History of Present Illness:
63M with PVD, EtOH and cocaine abuse, admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**2117-2-22**] with septic shock and E.coli bacteremia, now
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup and potential ERCP.
.
He presented on [**2-22**] with lethargy, disorientation, and fever to
105 with abdominal pain after his roommate called EMS.  Blood
cultures grew E.coli bacteremia and he developed septic shock
and was admitted to the ICU.  He was intubated and required both
vasopressin and norepinephrine.  Started on meropenem (and later
changed to irtapenem).  He had perc CCY tube placed on [**2-24**].
Pressors were weaned off.  He also had NSTEMI in setting of his
sepsis with peak troponin 37.88 on [**2-24**].  Echo showed EF 25-30%
with severe global LV HK.  There was also concern for worsening
RLE ischemia on pressors vs. true graft thrombosis.  On [**3-1**] he
went to the OR for RLE AKA and cholecystectomy.  Procedure
notable for somewhat difficult to remove gallbladder with some
resultant bleeding in gallbladder fossa.  No intraop
cholangiogram per procedure notes.  He was extubated on [**2117-3-1**].
 Post op noted to have increasing amylase (to 551) and lipase
(to 288).  Also developed fever to 100.8.  Could not get MRCP
due to shrapnel in eye (though wife does not know anything about
this), so being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP to evaluate these
new changes.
.
Speaking with patient's wife, she notes a change in mental
status since extubation.  Extubated on [**3-1**] and she reports that
he recognized her and other family members that night.  However,
the following day and yesterday he has been confused about where
he is and who friends and family were.  Also slurring speech
worse (has some slur at baseline).  No noted weakness in
UEs/LEs.  Has baseline facial asymmetry since MVA.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient appears comfortable.  Delerious and
disoriented but calm.  Denies pain of any type.  ROS as below.


Past Medical History:
- Severe PVD s/p multiple bypass surgeries of LEs (L femoral to
above knee bypass [**2115**], R external iliac to superficial femoral
artery bypass [**2115**] and R common iliac to above knee [**Doctor Last Name **] bypass
[**2116**]) and carotids (L CEA [**2115**]).
- HTN
- Hyperlipidemia
- Polysubstance abuse including EtOH and cocaine, ?others
- ?COPD
- Motorcycle accident resulting in need for reconstructive
surgery of L jaw.

Social History:
Married though is estranged from wife (lives with a few
roommates) mainly related to EtOH abuse.  Very heavy drinker.
Smoking history of approx 1 PPD per wife.  Cocaine positive on
tox, wife does not know much abuse illicit drug use history.


Family History:
Mother had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer.

Physical Exam:
General: Alert but somewhat lethargic at times, no distress.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL, MMM, appears to have some thrush
on posterior tongue. Poor dentition with most teeth missing.
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD.  L CEA scar.  Denies
posterior neck TTP.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi, but very poor effort.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen:  All incisions C/D/I.  RUQ port incision had been
draining small amount serous fluid, no purulence or bleeding.
Old healed RLQ scar from bypass.  +BS.  Soft, appears to be
diffusely tender, non-distended, no rebound tenderness or
guarding, no organomegaly.
Ext: warm, well perfused.  2+ L DP and PT pulses.  No edema.
s/p R AKA, wrapped.
Neuro: Alert.  Oriented to person only.  Facial asymmetry with
?droop of L lower face, though appears c/w past trauma and
asymmetric tooth loss.  Initially ?very mild L ptosis and
inability to raise L eyebrow, but able to do so later in exam.
Difficulties with cooperating and following commands (won't
smile).  Tongue does show some deviation to R.  EOMs not able to
be completely tested but will move in all directions.  PERRL.
Denies sensory deficits.  Extremity strength testing also
difficult.  Of LLE, [**5-12**] in dorsi/plantar flexing, but will not
move rest of muscle groups.  Of bilateral UEs, can get [**5-12**] elbow
flexion and [**5-12**] elbow extension on R, weaker on L vs. not fully
participating.  [**4-11**]+/5 intrinsic hand muscles.  Difficulty with
testing proximal UE muscle groups.  Unable to look for pronator
drift or asterixis due to lack of patient participation.  Tone
appears normal.

on dishcarge from the [**Hospital1 **], pt.s platelet count was 1,049,000.
This is felt to be a reactive thrombocytosis due to the combined
effects of: multiple recent surgeries, and also possibly post
alcohol abuse thrombocytopenia recovery.  ESR and CRP were
checked and are elevated supporting this etiology.  This will
need to be monitored - please check weekly CBC.  If platelet
count is continuing to rise, pt. will need evaluation by
hematology to rule out underlying ET or PV by peripheral smear
review and or bone marrow biopsy.  Here thre were no stigmata or
symptoms of thrombotic complication of this thrombocytosis
(uncommon in reactive thrombocytosis) and aspirin 325 mg was
started for combined effect of platelet inhibition and secondary
prevention given known cad and nstemi suffered at outside
hospital prior to admission here.
