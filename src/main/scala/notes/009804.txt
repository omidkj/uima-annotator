Chief Complaint:
Left leg pain and swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2188-12-10**]: Four compartment fasciotomies of left leg (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1005**]
[**2188-12-12**]: closure of left lower extremity fasciotomies. (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**2188-12-15**]: AVNRT ablation by EP cardiology


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old female with history of NSCLC with
liver metastases s/p right middle lobe lobectomy and
chemotherapy with taxol, carboplatin, and avastin.  She was
recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 79530**] for managment of recent
bilateral pulmonary embolism after presenting with SOB in her
[**Date range (1) 5564**], Dr.[**Name (NI) 3279**], office on [**2188-10-21**].  She was
discharged on enoxaparin 90 mg [**Hospital1 **] and was injecting this into
her bilateral thighs. Around [**2188-12-7**] she started noticing calf
and ankle swelling and tightness. She underwent a u/s at
[**Hospital1 **] which, per report, was negative for DVT. She presented
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-12-10**] where she was evaluated by the orthopedic
trauma service for concern for hematoma-related left calf
compartment syndrome. She underwent urgent left calf fasciotomy
on [**2188-12-10**]. She recovered well from that procedure without much
pain or discomfort.
.
On the morning of [**2188-12-15**], Mres. [**Known lastname **] was thought to be in
atrial fibrillation with RVR with rate in the 170s on the floor.
She got IV metoprolol x2, and was found to be hypotensive with
systolic BPs in 80s. She was evaluated by the MICU team who
noted a regular narrow complex tachycardia. Vagal maneuvers were
unsuccessful. BP was 90/40 on transfer to the MICU. She denied
chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or dizziness at
that time. She did endorse constipation and a cough productive
of sputum.
.
In the MICU, the patient was noted to be in AVNRT which would
only break for about 5 seconds with adenosine. After getting 11
doses of adenosine over the course of the morning on [**2188-12-14**]
without good effect, EP consult was obtained. On [**2188-12-15**] the
AVNRT was ablated; there were multiple ectopic atrial beats
noted.
.
She was transferred to the medicine floor on [**2188-12-16**].  On the
floor she reports feeling well. She denies pain except for pain
in her leg at the site of her recent surgery. No headache, SOB,
CP, palpitations, N/V/D/C.  Last BM was yesterday.  Has been OOB
with PT in MICU, with minimal weight bearing on LLE. Denies
fevers, chills, urinary or bowel habit changes. She states that
her last chemotherapy was received in [**2188-9-6**].  Prior to
her episode of pulmonary embolus in [**10-15**], she felt in her usual
state of health.
.
ROS was otherwise essentially negative. The pt denied recent
unintended weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches,
dizziness or vertigo, changes in hearing or vision, neck
stiffness,  dysphagia, odynophagia, heartburn, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia, cough, hemoptysis,
wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations,
orthpnea, joint pain.


Past Medical History:
1. Non small cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma)
    *[**2186**]: T1 N0 2.6-cm moderately differentiated
     adenocarcinoma s/p right middle lobectomy at [**Hospital1 2177**] [**2186-7-11**] by
     Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
    *[**2187**]: increasing right lower lung nodule. [**2187-7-31**] biopsy
     consistent with non-small cell carcinoma, favor
     adenocarcinoma.
    *[**2188**]: MRI of her brain done at [**Hospital6 **] on
     [**2188-6-26**]: no evidence of tumor. CT-guided biopsy of liver
     [**7-15**]: showed poorly differentiated metastatic NSCLC.
2. Allergic rhinitis.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hyperlipidemia.
5. Gastroesophaeal reflux disease.
6. Esophageal stricture, status post-dilation.
7. Status post-total hip replacements and one knee replacement.
8. Osteoarthritis.
9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: emphysema plus
   restriction secondary to volume loss from lobectomy.


Social History:
She is married and lives with her husband, [**Name (NI) **]. They winter in
[**State 108**] and they live in [**Location (un) 1110**], MA the rest of the time. She

alcohol. She smoked one pack a day for 30-years, but quit in

Family History:
There is no family history of any lung disease. Her brother had
some type of cancer, which was either a thyroid cancer or throat
cancer, the patient is not sure.

IMAGING:

LLE U/S [**2188-12-10**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No deep venous thrombosis.
2. Large avascular hypoechoic collection on the left medial calf
at site of palpable mass. Correlate clinically as this may
represent a seroma, less likely infected collection.

CT Chestm11/5/09: Impression:
1) Decreased pre-tracheal lymph nodes, with stable right hilar
and subcarinal lymphadenopathy.
2) Stable large subpulmonic effusion associated with thickening
of the
overlying pleura and enhancement suggesting metastatic disease.
3) Status post right lobectomy with atelectasis at the suture
line unchanged.
4) Stable multiple solid and ground-glass nodules: the largest,
in the
anterior segment of the left upper lobe, is lobulated and has
punctate
fat-attenuation. This was not PET-avid and may represent an
unrelated
non-aggressive abnormality, such as a hamartoma.
5) Mild coronary artery and aortic valvular calcification.
6) Enlargement of the left adrenal gland is stable, probably
metastasis.
7) No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or aneurysm.
