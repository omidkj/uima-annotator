nephrectomy.
4.  Reported IgA deficiency.
5.  Reported common variable immunodeficiency - pt states she
has required immunoglobulin transfusions in the past but has not
recently. Immunoglobulins [**2162-3-23**] here WNL.

RENAL U.S.  [**2168-1-8**] 2:58 PM
IMPRESSION: Status post-right nephrectomy and left partial lower
pole nephrectomy. No evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, mass, or
perinephric fluid collection.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2168-1-8**] 4:48 AM
TWO VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: Surgical clips in the left abdomen
likely indicate prior site of partial nephrectomy. No abnormally
dilated loops of small bowel are identified. There is a large
amount of gas throughout the colon. Osseous structures
demonstrate mild degenerative change in the lumbosacral spine.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of bowel obstruction.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT  [**2168-1-11**] 4:10 PM
IMPRESSION: Focal non-occlusive thrombus within the left
internal jugular vein.

CTU (ABD/PEL) W/&W/O CONTRAST  [**2168-1-13**] 5:49 PM
1) Pancreatic non-simple cysts with no main duct dilation and
new since [**2161**]. These may be due to prior pancreatitis or are
indicative of side-branch IPMT. Would perform EUS and potential
sampling. A PANCREATIC CTA WOULD OFFER NO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
AND NEED NOT BE PERFOMED.

2) No evidence of pyelonephritis. No change in tiny non-
obstructing stone of the left kidney. No hydronephrosis or
hydroureter.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient remained stable, no acute issues while hospitalized.
Her pain was controlled throughout and remained on appropriate
prophylaxis throughout.
.
#. Pyelonephritis/UTI - The patient has hx of admission for
pyelonephritis with culture + for VRE. Treated with 21 day
course of linezolid (started on [**12-21**] per pt.) The pt reports
[**Last Name (un) 1644**] improvement however has had persistent sx of fever at
home, N/V and flank pain. Urine Cx [**12-31**] mixed GN - low colony
counts. She then presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-1**] for her sx. She was
afebrile throuhgout her stay and imaging incl. CT and renal US
negative for [**Last Name (un) **]. The pancreatic cystic structure was discussed
with the patient and she will be following up regarding this
with outpatient GI.  Renal US [**1-8**] negative.
Pt was on linezolid and gentamycin then transitioned to
Cefazolin started [**1-10**] however E.coli was found to be
resistant.ID consult resulted in transfer to ICU for meropenem
desensitization: achieved rapidly without issue. Important to
note regarding patients allergies. Pt receive cefazolin during
this hospitalization without any reaction. She also received
rapid desensitization to meropenam without any reactions or
signs of allergic response. She continued on the meropendam and
will be discharged with a 10 day course to complete. Pain
control was transitioned from iv narcotics to PO to only tylenol
with some PO oxycodone for breakthrough. She will continue this
for a few days and all narcotics should be d/c'd in [**1-10**] days
after discharge.

.
# L IJ DVT - pt found to have asymptomatic, focal, non-occlusive
thrombus of L IJ. No evidence of thrombus involving current PICC
site. Pt has history of multiple instrumentations of neck - most
likely cause of thrombus. Pt was transitioned from hep gtt to
warfarin and is currently taking a regimen of 2.5 mg qd. She is
to follow up in 1 wk for coags checks.

# Elevated LFTs - Pt with elevetated AST, ALT, intermittently
elevated per records. Also w/ chronically elevated lipase. No
current abd pain.
- Hepatitis panel negative, iron studies WNL, resolved.
.
# ? Common Variable Immunodeficiency - pt reports past history,
however she has been "stable" for many years, no need for
immunoglobulins. Normal levels in [**2161**].
- Pt should follow up with ID as outpatient
.
# HTN - Continue diltiazem CD 360mg daily
pt's BP was stable and normal throughout, will be restarted on
home regimen upon leaving. Her diazide was held while N/V, but
home regimen restarted without issue.
.
# DM - pt reports she has been diet controlled since the [**2139
