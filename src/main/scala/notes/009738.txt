septum.

obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV
cavity size. Low normal LVEF.

diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

AR jet.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
Conclusions
Prebypass:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve is abnormal with a coaptation defect between
the right and left cusps seen best in long axis view, there is
question of leaftlet perforation. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2194-8-18**] at
0930.
Postbypass:
There is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position with no perivalvular leak. There is no evidence of
aortic dissection. Estimated left ventricular function is
unchanged from prebypass.

Final Report: In comparison with the study of earlier in this
date, the right chest tube has been removed.  No evidence of
pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacification persists and intact
midline sternal wires are present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30123**] was admitted and placed on IV Vancomycin and
Gentamicin for aortic valve endocarditis per the direction of
the infectious disease service.  He was evaluated by cardiac
surgery for an aortic valve replacement and underwent a
pre-operative work-up including teeth extractions. The patient
was brought to the Operating Room on [**2194-8-18**] where the patient
underwent tissue aortic valve replacement (#23mm tissue).  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
The patient remained stable in the immediate post-op period.
Anesthesia was reversed, the patient was neurologically intact
and he weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Over the next
several hours he weaned from vasopressor support. On POD1 Beta
blockers were initiated and he was started on diuretics and
gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight.  On POD1 the
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per
cardiac surgery protocol without complication.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  Per infectious disease service it was
recommended that he be discharged to home on a 2 week course of
ceftriaxone pending the results of his culture data. He declined
the recommendation from the infectious diseae service for IVAB
however, did agree to a 7 day course of po levoflox. The
infectious disease service will contact Mr. [**Known lastname 30123**] [**Last Name
