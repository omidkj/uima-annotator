Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**]
Chief Complaint:
right upper extremity weakness, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
69 yo F with DM, COPD, metastatic breast CA s/p cycle 1 of
adriamycin/cytoxan [**5-29**] awaiting 2nd cycle who was recently seen

in [**Hospital **] clinic and noted to have persistent RUE weakness.
MRI C spine showed mets to C5-C7 causing moderate compression of
cord.  She was admitted on [**8-9**] for spine eval and treatment.
She was started on steroids.  Pt triggered on [**8-10**] afternoon for
hypotension, low UOP, and hypoxia.  Pt refused interventions.
Started on broad abx and reportedly stabilized.
.
Tonight she was noted to be hypoxic to 85% on 6L.  She was
"difficult to arouse."  O2 sats improved with NRB.  VBG showed
7.44/47/47 w lactate 1.0.  Review of prior admit suggested that
she became altered almost nightly until rx with BiPAP which
successfully treated her sx.  This was tried on the floor but
patient became hypoxic and did not tolerate mask.  She is
admitted to ICU for w/u and rx with BiPAP.
.
Currently, she reports that she wants to be left alone.  She
denies any CP, SOB, abd pain.
.
Of note, she was hypoxic during her previous admission in
[**Month (only) 116**]/[**Month (only) **].  At that point, the etiology was unclear.  It was
thought [**2-23**] lymphangitic spread of tumor.  Also considered PE
(although CTA neg) and tamponade (although echo not c/w hd sig
tamponade).  Also considered fluid overload and she seemed to
improve somewhat with diuresis.  It was ultimately thought that
sleep apnea was large contributor.  She was treated w BiPap
nightly with significant improvement in mental status.


Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes. followed at [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center. Her last
hemoglobin A1c was 6.0 in 05/[**2104**].
2. Hypercholesterolemia/?hypertension
3. Schizoaffective disorder. The patient is followed by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] and is on Clozaril with q 1 month CBCs
4. COPD/Asthma. The patient is maintained on Advair and
albuterol for this. She does state that she uses her albuterol
approximately one time per day. Her last pulmonary function
tests were in [**2096**].
5. h/o Falls
6. Back pain
7. ? Severe sleep apnea: as documented above and per recent d/c
summary.  Improved with BiPAP in the unit last month.
.

Social History:
Has been residing at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab since her last
hospitalization. Health Care proxy is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]. She does not

smoke but notes that her mother smoked heavily.(HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]

TTE [**8-11**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to increased stroke volume due to aortic
regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Small, hyperdynamic left ventricle with normal
regional systolic function. Trivial pericardial effusion without
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-6-17**],
the pericardial effusion is smaller. The other findings are
similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Metastatic breast cancer: with C5-7 cord compression, right
upper extremity weakness improving on steroids. Also found to
have brain metastases and the patient has been treated with
Decadron. After extensive discussion with Ms. [**Known lastname 5655**], her HCP
and her outpatient psychiatrist, further chemotherapy or
radiation was refused. She was determined to have capacity to
make this decision and understands the risk of paralysis without
treatment.  She will be discharged to maximize functional status
and control symptoms.
.
# Resp failure/hypoxia: intermittent and likely related to
obstructive sleep apnea. Ms [**Known lastname 5655**] refused all interventions,
including BiPAP/CPAP and occassionally oxygen.  She was treated
with an 8 day course of antibiotics for health care associated
pneumonia with improvement in her pulmonary status. She was
maintained on nebulizer treatments and was on 4L O2 nasal canula
at discharge.

# Altered ms: underlying psychiatric illness with intermittent
hypoxia related to obstructive sleep apnea and brain metastases.
She waxed and waned through the hospitalization, but was at our
observed baseline at discharge.  Her outpatient dose of
clozapine was continued initially however the patient had
periods of agitation during her admission and the clozapine was
held. Her agitation was treated with ativan and zydis as needed.
The clozapine was not restarted on discharge.

# Hypotension: The patients home dose of lisinopril was held
second to her hypotension on admission. Her blood pressure
remained in the 130/60-70s so the lisinopril was not restarted.
She may need to be monitored for hypertension and be
re-evaluated by her primary physician when lisinopril can be
restarted safely.

# ID: For her cough with productive sputum, the patient
completed a course of vancomycin and zosyn. Her cough improved
and she remained afebrile for the duration of her admission.  At
discharge she w
