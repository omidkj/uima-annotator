Pertinent Results:
[**2146-11-4**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
left dominant system revealed no evidence of obstructive
disease. The LMCA was short and widely patent. The LAD had a 30%
mid-vessel lesion.  The LCx also had a 30% mid-vessel lesion.
The RCA was small and nondominant with minor disease. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart filling
pressures with a mean RA of 11mmHg and mean PCWP of 25mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary artery hypertension with PASP of
50mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.6 l/min/m2. 3.
There was severe aortic stenosis with a gradient of 33mmHg and
calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.62cm2. 4. Left ventriculography was
deferred. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary arteries are free of
angiographically significant disease. 2. Severe aortic stenosis.
3. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
[**2146-11-4**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA 70-79% stenosis, unchanged. Left
ICA 1-39% stenosis.
[**2146-11-9**] Echo: A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation
present is normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Normally functioning aortic mechanical prosthesis.
[**2146-11-13**] CXR: There are bilateral pleural effusions left greater
than right with volume loss at the left base. Again seen is a
small amount of fluid in the fissure on the right. The
pacemaker, sternotomy wires, and valve replacement are
unchanged. The right IJ line has been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mrs. [**Known lastname 33142**] is a 75 year old female
with history of Moderate AS, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, DM
presents with dyspnea and hypoxia with evidence of decompensated
congestive heart failure. Current presentation appeared to be an
acute decompensation, possibly suggestive of flash pulmonary
edema. Patient had stress of exercise prior and markedly
hypertensive on admission (although may be secondary to flash
itself), rate appears to have been well controlled although
transient RVR possible. She was ruled out for myocardial
infarction. Her BNP on admission was over [**2137**] consistent with
acute CHF exacerbation. She was diuresed with IV Lasix over the
course of 3 days with improvement in her symptoms. She was
maintained on her home dose of Lasix with good control. An
Echocardiogram on admission showed worsening of aortic stenosis
with a valve area of 0.8cm2. She subsequently underwent cardiac
catheterization both to characterize her aortic valvular disease
and rule out coronary artery disease. Results showed severe
aortic stenosis with a gradient of 33mmHg and calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of
0.62cm2 with no significant coronary lesions. At this time she
was transferred to the Cardiology service for evaluation for
Aortic Valve Replacement. Given the severity of her AS with
development of heart failure, it was determined that she would
benefit for surgical intervention. A carotid ultrasound done
prior to surgery showed stable unilateral carotid artery
disease. Neurology was consulted and felt no intervention was
indicated at this time. On [**11-8**] she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op
day one she was started on beta blockers and diuretics and
gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Later on this day she
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. Chest
tubes were removed on post-op day two and epicardial pacing
wires on post-op day three. Coumadin was started for mechanical
aortic valve with a Heparin bridge until INR was therapeutic. He
required reinsertion of his Foley catheter on post-op day three
d/t failure to void. She remained stable over the next several
days while working with physical therapy and awaiting her INR to
be therapeutic. On post-op day 7 she was discharged to home with
the appropriate follow-up appointments.
