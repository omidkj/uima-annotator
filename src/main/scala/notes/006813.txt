Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, bilateral PEs, referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible lysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
67 y/o M history of unprovoked PE, gout, p/w shortness of breath
found to have PE and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible clot
lysis. Pt had norovirus last week and lay in bed for 2-3 days
only getting up to use the bathroom. 72 hours after last viral
symptoms pt was climbing stairs in the house and reported
sensation of dyspnea highly reminiscent of the experience with
his last pulmonary embolism. 3 years ago pt diagnosed with
unprovoked PE, was on warfarin for 1 year [**2127**]-[**2128**]. PCP found
[**Name9 (PRE) **] positive, pt went to the ED at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] and found to
have pulmonary embolism involving all branches of left and right
pulmonary arteries, also found to have pulmonary hypertension.
ECG without evidence of strain. PT HDS throughout. Echo also
showed moderate pulmonary hypertension, mildly dilated right
ventricle with preserved systolic function, normal LV function.
Pt was started on lovenox 90 mg q12 h with plan to start
coumadin 7.5 mg [**2131-12-12**]. CT abd obtained given this being his 2nd
episode of unprovoked PE, results pending.
.
PT was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible clot lysis in the CCU.
On arrival pt appeared very comfortable and pleasant. HDS with
VS 165/82 99% RA RR16 HR 58 afebrile.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

no cardiac history
unprovoked DVT/PE in [**2127**], was on coumadin for 1 year

STUDIES:
- ECG: [**2131-12-12**] at [**Hospital1 **]:  multifocal appearance of P waves in II
suggesting possible wandering atrial pacemaker or PACs.
Otherwise no signs of RV strain (no tall R waves v1 or v2, no
right axis deviation, no inverted T waves in precordial leads).
No ST changes or signs of ischemia. Normal intervals. No q
waves. ECG unchanged from ECG at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on presentation.
.
- ECHO:  [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]: echo with moderate pulmonary hypertension,
mildly dilated R ventricle with preserved systolic fn, normal LV
function.
.
CT chest at [**Location (un) 620**] read as: evidence of ventricular septal
bulge and pulmonary embolism involving all branches of the left
and right pulmonary arteries along with pulmonary artery
hypertension. Ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe which
may represent infectious or ischemic etiology. 3 mm nodule in
right upper lobe.
.
TTE; [**2131-12-13**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated right ventricle with evidence of
mild hypokinesis of the RV free wall. There is relative sparing
of the RV apex ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign). At least mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation with
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
