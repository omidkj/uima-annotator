Chief Complaint:
CP, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MVR [**2153-10-10**] ([**Company 1543**] Mosaic 29 mm pig valve)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 y/o F w/ COPD, CHF, nl EF, AF, severe MR who is
tferred to the CCU team for further monitoring after an episode
of acute pulonary edema and CP while on the floor. Patient was
tferred from an OSH to the cardiothoracic surgery service today
for evaluation for CABG-TVR-MVR. The patient was admitted on
[**2153-9-24**] to OSH with increasing DOE and SOB as well as some chest
"pressure." She was found to be in CHF on admission and was
ruled out for an MI. She was reportedly diuresed with lasix and
had an echo which showed LVH,, severe MR and severe TR, EF
60-65%. The patient went into atrial fibrillation on [**2153-9-27**],
there is no clear prior history of this. She was started on
heparin gtt which she remains on. She underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2153-10-1**] which demonstrated prox LAD 50-60%,
narrow RCA 60%, patent LMCA, severe MR, PA 65/25, LVEDP 15, EF
75%. She was accepted to the ct surgery service and on arrival
this evening was c/o 8/10 chest pain as well as acute SOB. Her
HR was reportedly in the 40s and she was reportedly cool and
clammy, but when she was placed on tele she was in rapid afib
w/RVR in the 140s. EKG without ischemic changes. A medicine
resident was nearby and gave her lasix 20 mg IV and 2 SL NTG
with improvement in her rate, SOB, and CP. The patient currently
is sleeping but on arousal still c/o upper right sided [**1-25**] CP,
feels like gas, no radiation, and says her breathing is much
better. She denies any orthopnea, LH, palpitations, n/v.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
75 y/o F w/ COPD, AF, CAD, severe MR, severe TR, a/w CHF to OSH,
txferred to floor for surgery on [**2153-10-10**].
.
#Cardiac:
-Pump: Preserved EF with CHF.  (EF estimated from echo and
likely to be an overestimate based on reverse flow through
MR/TR.
- will hold on further Lasix as pt does not currently appear to
be fluid overloaded.  However, will be cautious as pt has
flashed in past.  Pt responded to IVF for decreased UOP. Current
UOP over last 2 days approx 30xcc/hr. Renal function improving.

-Monitor intake as previously pt had h/o flash edema.
.
-Rhythm: Pt still in asymptomatic afib.
-Per notes, pt has been in AF since [**9-27**] at OSH.  RVR on floor
here.  Lasix and SL nitro resolved.
-[**10-7**] pt converted into sinus rhythm on tele monitoring.
-[**Date range (1) 65405**]: reverted to afib - asymptomatic
- increased metoprolol to 37.5 tid. However BP a little lower in
mid 80s after morning rounds on [**10-9**].
- on heparin, will continue.  Hold on warfarin for now
.
-Ischemia: no evidence.  enzymes negative X3 here.
- on BB, ACEI initially.  given [**Doctor First Name 48**] acei held and changed to
hydral in pt with severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 65406**] reduction.
- cont ASA (has had ulcer surgery in past)
.
# Respiratory:  Flashed on floor.
- Flash was more related to rate than to overall fluid status.
- Will monitor patient closely.
- Cont metoprolol for BP control and rate control
- Will hold on lasix for now.
- repeat CXR on [**10-7**] - improved - no need to tap.
.
# COPD - hold albuterol nebs.  Start ipratropium nebs and
salmeterol and flovent inhalers. (pt well controlled).
.
# Renal: Pt with normal creat at OSH now with rising Creat to
1.9
- improved to 1.0.  Urine lytes consistent with prerenal state
on [**2153-10-7**]. Patient was cathed on [**10-1**], at risk for dye
nephropathy
- pt likely to have poor forward flow in setting of TR and MR.
- repeat urine lytes consistent with prerenal stage given IVF
.
#Hx of ulcer - PPI.  Pt is on ASA - will guaiac all stools.
.
#OA - chronic pain - takes vicodin
.
# FEN: Replete lytes as needed. Low Na/Heart healthy diet
.
#Osteoporosis - calcium and fosamax
.
#Ppx: Hep IV, ASA, tylenol, bowel reg, PPI
.
#Full Code
Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for MVR/ possible CABG and underwent MVR
with a 29 mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic pig valve on [**10-10**]. Transferred to
the CSRU in stable condition on epinephrine and propofol drips.
Started amiodarone to help keep the patient in SR. Epinephrine
DCed and nitroglycerin drip started on POD #1. Patient was
extubated on POD #2 and chest tubes were also
removed.Transferred to the floor that evening.

She had some serous sternal drainage and was started on betadine
dressings and vanco. Beta blockade was begun. CXR showed a left
pleural effusion. She went back into Afib on POD #3. Coumadin
was started and heparin IV began on POD #4 . She was alert and
oriented and ambulating with her walker on the floor. She had
some brief NSVT that evening, and Mg was repleted. Pacing wires
were removed on POD #5 and vancomycin was stopped. It was agreed
that the patient could go home with services as her son would be
available to help her during the day.  Target INR is 1.5- 2.0.
Theophylline was restarted prior to discharge. Cleared for
discharge on [**10-16**] with INR 1.8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32665**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 65407**] will
be following INR/coumadin dosing.
