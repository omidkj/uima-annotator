Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30158**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M s/p fall 3 weeks ago, being transferred from [**Hospital3 417**]
Hopsital with hypotension. Hx from son. Pt fell about 3 weeks
ago, and presumably sustained a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Admitted to SICU in [**Hospital1 2177**], with questionable seizure and required
intubation for 2 days. One week stay at [**Hospital1 2177**]. His mental status
began to decline during that hospitalization, with increasing
confusion. With transfer to the floor pt was noted to have
further decline in his mental status, with an inability to
converse well. He remained on the floor for about 2 weeks, with
his course c/b agitation and MRSA infection of unclear etiology.
A feeding tube was placed and pt was sent to rehab on the
morning of transfer, where he was found to have what was thought
to be [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] respirations. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son described this as
breathing irregularly, hard and fast for about 40 seconds, and
then normal breathing. His mental status continued to decline.
He was sent to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, where a head CT was
performed, and he was intubated. Pt was then transferred here on
peripheral dopamine, levophed, and propofol for hypotension.
.
In the ED, VS were 85/41 (on levophed and dopamine), HR in 140s
in a fib. Neurosurgery evaluated pt, and felt that the changes
on head CT were mainly old - scattered foci of SAH, with
possibly 2 newer subarachnoid hemorrhages, but no intervention
indicated. Also with older frontal stroke. Pt was noted to be
hypotensive with a leukocytosis, and possible pneumonia on CXR.
Pt rec'd vancomycin and Zosyn. A R IJ was placed. Patient was
brought to the MICU.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-5-5**] 8:50 PM
1. Scattered small amount of subarachnoid blood in sulci of
bilateral posterior parietal and occipital lobes.
2. Small amount of acute subdural hemorrhage in the area of the
right posterior parietal/ occipital lobe.
3. Area of encephalomalacia in the left frontal lobe. Focus of
increased attenuation within this area most likely represents
streak artifact, although it is difficult to exclude a
hemorrhagic component. Attention to this area on followup scan
should be paid.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

1. Endotracheal tube in standard position.
2. Dense retrocardiac opacity most likely represents
atelectasis, but pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
Attention to this area on close interval followup is recommended
to exclude developing pneumonia.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2157-5-10**] 6:00 PM
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Comparison with examination of [**2157-5-5**], 23:35 p.m. Multiple foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the
left posterior frontal, left occipital, right occipital, right
temporal are less prominent than the previous exam. Area of
hypodensity in the left frontal lobe is again noted. The area of
concern representing possible hemorrhage is less obvious on
today's study. There is very mild shift of the left cingulate
gyrus, unchanged. Minimal subdural fluid surrounding the right
temporal, frontal, and parieto-occipital lobes is similar to the
previous exam. No hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular
territorial infarct is identified. Frontal, maxillary, ethmoid
air cells, sphenoid sinuses, are clear. Mastoid air cells show
scattered opacification. Soft tissue densities in both external
auditory canals again identified.
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in multiple foci of extra-axial
hemorrhage. No new hemorrhagic focus.
Area of hypodensity in the left frontal lobe, not significantly
changed.
.
[**2157-5-11**] EEG
This is an abnormal EEG due to the left centroparietal
sharp waves which occasionally generalized and due to the slow
and
disorganized background. The first abnormality suggests a left
centroparietal region of cortical hypersynchrony. The slow and
disorganized background suggests a mild to moderate
encephalopathy,
which may be seen with infections, toxic metabolic abnormalities
or
medication effect.
.
[**2157-5-12**] TTE
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yr old male with SAH following fall, course complicated by
hypotension, A-fibb with RVR, altered mental status, ?pneumonia.

.
In the MICU the patient's hypotension was initially ascribed to
sepsis and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
The patient was intially treated with vancomycin and zosyn for
broad coverage and the electrophysiology service was consulted
regarding the AFIB with RVR. The patient was cardioverted with
one 360 joule shock on [**2157-5-6**]. This resluted in normalization
of the patient's heart rate and improvement in the patient's
blood pressure. Of note the patient's pacemaker was interrogated
and revealed that he had been in afib since placement of the
pacemaker ~6months ago. The patient's antibiotics were
discontinued on [**5-8**] as it was felt that his hypotension was
largely caused by heart failure in the setting of the afib with
RVR. That said,
