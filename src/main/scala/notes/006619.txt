Service:  NSU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old
woman with minimal medical history who was completely in her
usual state of good health until Sunday [**2155-4-15**] when she was
struck with a headache that she described as the worse of her
life making her had feel as if it would explode.  She did
have positive loss of urinary continence she states.  The
family states that her speech was slurred at the time.  On
the following day the patient went to work but the headache
continued and she became lightheaded and developed neck pain.
She was taken to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital where a head CT showed a
subarachnoid hemorrhage with questionable involvement of an
anterior communicating artery aneurysm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, uterine cancer and
hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature was 100.  In general
she was in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat:  Neck was supple, no thyromegaly.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Her pulmonary status, lungs were clear bilaterally.
Neurologically she was awake, alert and oriented times three
with fluent speech, no slurring.  Her recall was [**4-9**].  Her
hearing was normal to finger rub.  Pupils were 3 down to 2 mm
bilaterally.  Her EOM's were full.  Visual fields were full.
Her strength was [**4-9**] in all muscle groups except for her
bilateral IP's which were 4+ and bilateral AT's which were
4+.  Her sensation was intact to light touch.  Her reflexes
are 2+ throughout.

Her vital signs remained stable and she was admitted to the
ICU for close neurologic observation.  On [**2155-4-16**] she was
taken to A Gram which she was found to have a right A1 to A2
junction broad based aneurysm with daughter aneurysm.  She
was transferred back to the ICU.  Post procedure she remained
neurologically stable, awake, alert, oriented times three
complaining of headaches.  Speech was fluent.  She had a
groin line in place which was stable and without oozing.  She
was taken to the O.R. on [**2155-4-17**] for clipping of this
aneurysm.  There were no intraoperative complications.
Postop she was oriented times three, visual fields were full
to confrontation, EOM's full.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Facial movement was intact.  She had no
drift.  Her strength was [**4-9**] in all muscle groups.  She was
out of bed to chair in postop day two.  On [**2155-4-19**] she was
awake, alert, oriented times three.  Pupils were 4 down to 2
mm, EOM's are full.  Face was symmetric.  She had no drift.
Her strength is intact.  She was kept in the ICU for close
observation with her blood pressure 150 to 170.  The patient
had an angio on [**2155-4-21**] which showed evidence of vasospasm in
the A1-A2 segment and a clipped aneurysm without residual.
Therefore, the patient's blood pressure was back up to
greater than 160, central venous pressure greater than 6.
Her sheaths were discontinued.  She remained neurologically
stable. Eom's full, no drift.  Strength 5/5 awake, alert and
oriented times two to three.

The patient remained in the intensive care unit on close
observation with a blood pressure greater than 150 to 170
range for a total of two weeks.

On [**2155-4-25**] she did develop shortness of breath and chest x-
ray did show congestive heart failure.  She was then kept
euvolemic and treated with Neo-Synephrine to keep her blood
pressure in the 160 range and intravenous fluid was backed
off.  She did get treated with some Lasix intermittently and
congestive heart failure did resolve.  She remained stable
neurologically and in the Intensive care unit.  TCD's on a
daily basis but she continued to show significant spasm and
her blood pressures kept greater than 150, central venous
pressure greater than 6.  Her chest x-ray showed resolving
congestive heart failure.  Transcranial Dopplers on [**2155-4-30**]
showed persistent spasm in the right MCA vessel, otherwise
improved.

The patient was weaned off her Neo and started on a p.o.
Midodrine 10 mg three times a day and Neo was weaned, trying
to keep her blood pressure greater than 100  and the
Midodrine was slowly increased.  The patient was eventually
transferred to the regular floor on [**2155-5-6**] in stable
condition.  Her Midodrine was increased.  Currently her
Midodrine is 40 mg p.o. three times a day.  Her neurological
status remains stable.  She was awake, alert with no facial
asymmetry, no drift.  Her strength was [**4-9**] in all muscle
groups.  She was transferred to the floor on [**2155-5-6**].  She was
seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and found
to require a short rehabilitation stay prior to discharge to
home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Midodrine 40 mg p.o. three times a day.
2. Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. twice a day.
3. Nystatin 5 cc's p.o. q day p.r.n.
4. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously q 12 hours.
5. Panpranazole 40 mg p.o. q. 24 hours.
6. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 hours.
7. Citalopram Hydrobromide 20 mg p.o. q day

Her condition was stable at the time of discharge.  She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in two weeks.
