Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 54yo M with Crohn's disease s/p multiple surgeries
with resultant short gut syndrome [**12-22**] to colectomy and ileostomy
and TPN dependency who was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation of low grade fevers, history of multiple line
infections, MV endocarditis and osteomyelitis for which the pt
is on chronic vancomycin for last 4 years, hickman for TPN, now
present w/ fever and hypotension.
.
At home he became febrile (24 hr nursing care) w/ to 103.4. His
nurse called Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (ID)on [**8-23**] who was notified
that he developed fever to 101 but subsequently deferveced. He
was instructed to call back if recurrent fever. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
called back later that his temp was 103 and she instructed him
to go to the ED. He also had +fatigue. He had decreased activity
and appetite. + Dyspnea w/any exertion.
.
He was recently admit to [**Hospital1 **] 2 weeks ([**Date range (1) 8403**]) ago for fever -
work up for etiology neg. Durint that admission, he had no
leukocytosis. CXR was negative for pneumonia. All blood cultures
were negative to date, including cultures for yeast, mycolytic
infections and for M. furfur. Urine culture was negative. TEE
was negative for endocarditis. CT of the cspine and bone scan
were negative for osteomyelitis. MRI showed subtle signal
changes which may suggest chronic osteomyelitis but no prior MRI
was available for comparision( last one was in [**2193**], when he did
not have osteo).His Hickman was felt to be free of infection, so
it was not pulled.
.
He denies any headache, neck pain, CP, chills, lightheadedness,
headache, cough/sputum production, or change in bowel or urinary
habits (burning, frequency, etc.). He also has noticed no
erythema, tenderness, or swelling around his Hickman line (last
changed [**2196-7-21**]), though he notes that his previous line
infections have also been without external/visible changes. He
has no sick contacts or recent travel.
.
In the ED, he had bld cultures sent. Vanco and zosyn was given
(pt was already on vanco qod). ID was notified. CXR no evidence
no focal infiltrate or change from prior CXR. BP 70s/40s. 2L NS.
BP improved to 80-90s/40s.He did not have any signs of distress
and was mentating within his normal range Small rim of erythema
around Hickman, but obvious pus. Stoma was WNL.
.
He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring for
hypotension.

RUQ U/S:
FINDINGS: The patient is status post cholecystectomy. There is
no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common
duct measures 6 mm in diameter, which is not significantly
changed, allowing for differences in technique. The main portal
vein shows appropriate hepatopetal flow. No focal liver lesions
are identified, and the echotexture of the liver appears normal.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
.
FRONTAL CHEST: Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable,
with mild cardiomegaly. No focal consolidations are identified
within the lungs. No evidence of pleural effusion. Multiple
right-sided rib fractures again seen. Right-sided central venous
line with tip overlying the distal SVC. Cervical fusion hardware
again noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process or
significant change from prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Fever: Blood culture and urine cultures were sent. CXR on
admission did not show focal infiltrate. He was started on vanco
(increased from chronic qod to qd) and zosyn (per discussion w/
ID). His recent hosp admission record [**7-26**] was reviewed and
showed extensive infectious workup which was unrevealing
(including MRI c-spine, which revealed no significant new
changes; neg bone scan; negative blood cultures; negative TEE).
GI and ID were concerned that his line (hickman placed in [**7-25**])
was the source of his fever. He has never had anything cultured
from the line and his cultures are again negative, though his
chronic vancomycin may be suppressing the organism. ID
recommended his home TPN be cultured (including M furfur).
Given negative cultures, the zosyn was discontinued and his
vancomycin was returned to [**Location **] dosing.  The patient remained
afebrile x 24 hours and was thus discharged home with
instructions to continue checking his temperature at least 2
times per day.

Hypotension-Pt was initially hypotensive to SBP 70s in the ED.
He responded quickly to a number of 500cc IVF boluses over the
initial 48 hrs. His BP meds were initially held.  He will
follow-up with his primary care doctor for a repeat blood
pressure check to consider restarting his lisinopril given his
history of MR.  His norvasc and lasix are also being held.

Hyperbilirubinemia/Elevated ALk Phos- His alk phos and bili were
elevated on admission (rest of his LFTs was relatively stable).
He did not complain of pain. RUQ u/s recommended by GI was
un
