History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 57853**] is a 76yo male who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**10-11**] with complaints of SOB. He had a WCC of 11.2 w a CXR
suggestive of COPD w/o signs of CHF or PNA. He was admitted for
treatment of COPD exacerbation. On [**10-12**] he complained of RUQ
pain, without fevers/N/V/D. An abdominal CT demonstrated
cholelithiasis w gallbladder wall thickening and edema, raising
concern for cholecystitis. However on [**10-13**] he underwent a HIDA
scan with no signs of cystic obstruction or acute cholecystitis.
For uncertain reasons patient underwent a lap chole for
treatment of presumed cholecystitis. Procedure was completed w/o
incident and patient was discharged. On POD#3, pt presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with fevers, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis 14.4,
concern for retained stone vs biliary leak. Pt possibly had a
HIDA at this time, although no report has been found. Patient
was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP. At time of transfer
patient's vitals were recorded as 97.6 113/61 67 93% 2LNC.
.
On arrival at ERCP patient's vitals were T98.6 HR71 BP156/58
RR24 O2sat 100% 2LNC. During pre-op preparation, patient went
into respiratory distress on passing a BM, requiring bipap. He
was then intubation for airway protection for the procedure.
.
ERCP was completed, finding a single 6mm round stone causing
partial obstruction of the CBD; a single plastic stent was
placed.
.
On transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], initial VS were: T97.6 P89 BP98/44 R26
O2 sat 98% on CMV 100% Fi02, Tv550 RR16 PEEP5. Patient's SBP
trended down to high 80s. Patient was bolused 500cc NS and his
propofol was decreased then switched to fent/midaz. Pressures
improved to MAPs >65.

CXR [**10-17**]: IMPRESSION:
Interstitial lung disease, scarring left upper lung zone,
atelectasis at the right lung base.
.
CXR [**2160-10-18**]:Single portable chest radiograph is compared to
multiple prior examinations.  Endotracheal tube terminates at
the thoracic inlet. Status post CABG.  Diffuse interstitial
edema with Kerley B lines. Mild atelectasis at both lung bases.
Heart is top normal in size. Aorta is calcified and somewhat
tortuous. Scarring is present in the left upper lobe periphery.
.
ERCP [**2160-10-17**]: A single periampullary diverticulum with large
opening was found at the major papilla Cannulation of the
biliary duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after
a guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting
in complete opacification.  A single 6 mm round stone that was
causing partial obstruction was seen at the middle third of the
common bile duct.  A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12
o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire.
The stone was extracted successfully using a 11.5 mm RX balloon.

To ensure bile duct patency, a 5cm by 10mm single pigtail
biliary stent was placed successfully.  Otherwise normal ercp to
third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Choledocolithiasis: Pt had undergone cholecystectomy 3 days
prior to returning with fevers and leukocytosis.  Imaging/labs
were concerning for retained CBD stone.  Pt was transferred for
ERCP and developped respiratory distress prior to procedure
requiring BIPAP.  He was electively intubated for ERCP which
revealed 6mm CBD stone.  Pt underwent sphincterotomy, stone
extraction and stenting before being transferred back to the ICU
intubation.  Pt was treated empirically with Cipro/Flagyl and
did not show signs of sepsis while in the ICU.  He was extubated
and weaned to home O2 of 2-3L within 48hrs of admission.  LFTs
trended down post procedure and will need to be followed up as
an outpt.  Pt was scheduled for follow up ERCP in [**Month (only) **] for
re-evaluation and stent removal.  After transfer to the floor,
pt was continued on Cipro/Flagyl for 5 day course but was noted
to have profuse diarrhea which returned positive for C.diff.
Cipro was stopped and pt was continued on Flagyl 500mg TID with
Vanc 250mg po q6hrs.  Pt was treated with low dose oxycodone for
abd cramping and remained with a normal WBC ct, tolerating a
regular diet.  He was discharged after HD on [**10-25**] with plan for
surgical follow up on [**10-27**] and was given a prescription for 8
additional days of po Vancomycin.
.
#. Emphysema/COPD/Fibrosis: Pt developped acute respiratory
distress pre-ERCP and required intubation.  He was notably more
hypoxic in the first few days post intubation possibly due to
volume and bronchospasm.  However, with HD and volume loss of
diarrhea, his breathing returned to baseline with 2-3L O2
requirement at rest.  He was seen by physical therapy who
recommended home PT and he was continued on his home regimen of
Advair, Spiriva and Levalbuterol.
.
#. CAD/PVD: Pt has significant vascular disease with CAD, aortic
stenosis s/p AV replacement and significant PVD s/p AAA repair
and bypass.  Per ERCP team, aspirin was held for 5 days post
procedure and he was restarted on [**10-22**] without complications.
He was otherwise continued on his home regimen of Lisinopril and
Atorvastatin.
.
#. ESRD on HD T/Th/Sat: Pt was followed by the renal team while
in house and was dialyzed Tu/Th/Sa.  He was continued on his
home regimen of nephrocaps and sevelamer.
