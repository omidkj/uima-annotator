Last Colonoscopy [**2114**]
Findings:
 Protruding Lesions Non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids were noted
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid
colon.  The colonoscopic examination was otherwise normal to the
cecum.The terminal ileum appeared normal.

Last Echo [**2118**]
Conclusions:
Views were extremely limited. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed. No
aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild to moderate ([**11-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion

RADIOLOGY ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-1-29**] 2:23 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked diffuse small-bowel dilatation with extensive
pneumatosis, air in mesenteric vessels, and portal venous air
consistent with ischemic bowel and concerning for bowel
infarction. Note: study is limited by lack of IV contrast, and
therefore an embolic or thrombotic event to a mesenteric vessel
cannot be excluded, particularly given evidence of extensive
background vascular disease.
2. At least two sub 5 mm pulmonary nodules seen in the right
lower lobe. In the absence of malignancy, one-year follow up
would be recommended to document stability.





Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit
under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Resuscitation was initiated and
a central line placed.  The CT findings concerning for ischemic
bowel were discussed with the patient and her family and
non-operative intervention was decided upon despite a discussion
of the likely mortality of her condition.  She remained with
supportive treatment overnight with IV antibiotics, IV
hydration, and NGT decompression.  Discussions regarding her
condition and prognosis were again held with the patient and her
family and at this point operative intervention was agreed upon.
 The patient was taken to the operating room and an exploratory
laparotomy perfomed.  Please see operative dictation for
details.  She was found to have a necrotic, non-viable small
bowel too extensive for resection.  She was taken back to the
surgical ICU and discussions were held with the patient and her
family.  A comfort-only course was then persued and the patient
expired later that day.
