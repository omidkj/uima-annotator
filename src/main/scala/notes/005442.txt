                      ADDENDUM


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.
HOSPITAL COURSE:  Continued from [**3-13**].

1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient
continued to do well on minimal oxygen supplementation which
is her baseline.  She is currently on 2 L nasal cannula with
an oxygen saturation between 94 and 97%.  An ABG was repeated
on the morning of [**2135-3-14**], which revealed a pH of 7.40,
and a slow taper decreasing by 5 mg every 7 days is to be
continued.  She is back on her baseline dose of Serevent 2
puffs b.i.d., as well as Flovent 110 mcg 8 puffs b.i.d.  She
continued on nebulizer treatments as needed, as well as
Accolate 20 mg p.o. q.d.  There was no recurrence of wheezing
or respiratory distress.  No PFTs were repeated during this
hospitalization.

2.  Mental status changes/delirium:  When I met the patient
on [**3-14**], she was disoriented times three and was unable to
follow commands and was somewhat lethargic.  The differential
was brought at that point in time; however, her electrolytes
remained normal.  She had no new infectious sources.  She had
received Klonopin.  Her last dose was [**3-12**].  She was
started on this for a long-standing history of anxiety.  She
was switched to Xanax on [**3-13**], and this was discontinued,
the last dose being [**2135-3-15**].  After this was stopped,
her delirium cleared on a daily basis.  She is now oriented
times three with self-correction and quite interactive. She is
still a bit slower than baseline at the time of discharge.

3.  Upper extremity weakness:  The patient had profound upper
extremity weakness noted during her delirious state; however,
was unable to further evaluate until her delirium cleared.
When it did clear, it was noted that she had no wrist flexion
or extension strength at all, as well as any interosseous
muscle strength bilaterally.  She was able to lift her left
arm over head, however, not her right arm.  She had
significant muscle atrophy in both hands, as well as her
forearm. She also had rpofound weakness of bilat lower
extremities but not as severe as the upper extremities. She has
known history of lumbar osteoarthritis. It
was felt that perhaps she is suffering from cervical
spondylosis.  She did not have any asymmetric facial droop or
muscle weakness.  She does have, in addition, lower extremity
weakness and no rigidity noted in her muscles.  She has
normal muscle tone in her lower extremities.

At this point in time, a Neurology consult was obtained to
further assist in determining whether she had truly a
cervical process versus a peripheral myopathy/neuropathy.
Their impression, as well, was that she may have a cervical
process, and an MRI would be helpful to rule out osteophytes
in her cervical spine; however, the patient did not want to
undergo the MRI secondary to claustrophobia.  We did offer
her a soft cervical neck collar which she will wear
throughout her rehabilitation until she has improved.  The
other question was whether or not she had a myopathy, steroid
induced, or a peripheral neuropathy in the post Intensive
Care Unit setting.  The patient was scheduled to undergo EMG
on the morning of discharge to help further delineate this
diagnosis however she refused this study. however, a quick taper
of her steroids is not in
her best interest, as we do not want her to go back into
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
Therefore, there will be no management changes; this
particular test will just help diagnosis.  She is a poor
surgical candidate, if indeed she does have significant
cervical spondyloarthropathy, and therefore, insisting on an
MRI is not indicated.Of note pt did not have any significatn
weakness or upper extremity dysfunction at the time of admission
so most of sxs likely related to steroids and effects of ICU.

Cardiovascular:  She does have a history of hypertension;
however, with aggressive control of her hypertension, her
delirium did surface.  She was on an ACE inhibitor and
Norvasc which were both discontinued as we wanted to eliminate
any new meds and her BP seemed to be normalizing with decrease
of steroids, and her blood pressures
are currently are running in the 130-140 systolic range.  She
may require to have an antihypertensive re-added at a later
date; however, we will hold at this point in time.

Anemia:  The patient's hematocrit continued to drift
downward.  She required a transfusion of 1 U on [**2135-3-17**].  She has chronic OB positive stool noted prior to her
MICU stay.  Lower GI scoping was deferred at this point in
time, as the patient is recuperating from her prolonged MICU
hospitalization.  Perhaps this will be readdressed after her
rehabilitation stay; however, her overall prognosis is pretty
poor considering her extensive chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and this will need to be discussed between her and
her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Infectious disease:  She did have a central venous catheter
in from which 1 out of 4 bottles of coag negative staph grew.
She was started on Vancomycin in the Intensive Care Unit, in
the setting of multiple blood cultures being positive from
central line sites.  She will finish her Vancomycin course on
[**2135-3-18**].  Otherwise, she had no other infectious
disease issues.  She was on Fluconazole during her hospital
stay while on Prednisone for thrush; however, now she is on
Mycelex.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to [**Hospital 21533**]
Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation status
post 12-day intubation.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  possible Cervical spondylosis

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Serevent 2 puffs b.i.d., Flovent 110
mcg 8 puffs b.i.d., Prednisone 15 mg p.o. q.d. until [**3-19**],
and then 10 mg q.d. for 7 days, then 5 mg p.o. q.d. for
another 7 days, and then off, Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs q.4
