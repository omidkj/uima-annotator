Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath- [**8-29**]
Flex Sigmoidoscopy- [**9-4**]

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old man with pmh significant for CAD
s/p multiple stents to LAD, RCA, and LCX presenting with chest
pain while recovering in the PACU from Laparascopic
cholecystectomy.  The patient had been experiencing symptoms of
biliary colic for a week.  He had an ERCP on [**8-16**] during which he
underwent sphincterotomy with removal of multiple stones.  The
patient then returned on [**8-27**] with similar abdominal pain and
underwent laparascopic cholecystectomy today.  While in the PACU
he developed chest pain which was relieved by dilaudid.  ECG at
this time showed ST depressions in V1-V4, and ST elevations in
I, II, and III.  Bedside echo showed LVEF of 30-40% with
posterior wall hypokinesis and mitral regurgitation.  The
patient was started on heparin IV, beta blocker, and aspirin.
He was also hypertensive during this episode with blood
pressures 160/100.  He was started on nitro and had foley
placed, after which his blood pressure dropped to 130/80's, his
pain resolved and his ekg changes resolved as well.

On admission to the CCU the patient is in noticable discomfort.
he was reporting epigastric burning pain with nausea.  He
reported the pain was unlike his anginal episodes.  His anginal
episodes usually present as substernal pressure.  The patient
was on 5mcg of nitro gtt at the time without resolution of pain.
 an ekg taken at this time did not show ischemic ekg changes.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG [**8-28**]- Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats. Non-specific
ST-T wave changes.
Consider myocardial ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2197-8-27**]
ST-T wave changes and atrial premature beats are new.

ECHO [**8-28**]- The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and lateral
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size appears normal with
preserved free wall motion in focused views. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Very mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Cardiac Cath [**8-29**]- 1. One-vessel significant coronary artery
disease with very late stent thrombosis of LCX
2. Successful thrombectomy, PTCA, and drug-eluting stenting of
the LCX.

ECHO [**8-30**]- The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and distal
lateral wall. The remaining segments contract well (LVEF
35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild [1+] aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 74 year old man with diabetes, coronary artery
disease, presenting with a STEMI in the setting of hypertension
while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, s/p
thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab with hospital course
complicated by lower GI bleeding.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient has a history of significant cortonary
artery disease s/p multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.
 His chest pain was accompanied by EKG changes and a newly
depressed ejection fraction to 35-40%, along with posterior wall
hypokinesis.  He continued to have chest pain with CE elevation
and was taken to the cath lab on [**8-29**].  The cath showed
two-vessel disease.  The LCx had moderate in-stent restensosis
and thrombus extending from the proximal portion to the middle
of the vessel.  The RCA had diffuse mild disease and minimal
in-stent restenosis and a moderate discrete lesion in the mid
PDA. He had a successful thrombectomy, PTCA, and stenting of the
proximal and mid LCx with a 2.5 x 28mm Xience drug eluting stent
which was postdilated to 3.0mm. Final angiography revealed no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis, and
TIMI 3 flow. His CEs showed a peak CK=2140 with Trop 3.88 and MB
143 on [**8-29**].  Patient was continued on aspirin and plavix upon
return to the unit.  Experienced occasional chest discomfort
while in-house but each episode was mild and lasted no more than
10 seconds.  No EKG changes.  Upon discharge, patient was
comfortable.  Denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
palpitations, edema.  He will need to be continued on aspirin
325mg indefinitely as well as Plavix 75mg daily for at least one
year. He is also on metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily and high
dose Atorvastatin.
