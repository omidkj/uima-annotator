She recently presented with similar symptoms of hypertensive
urgency c/b pulmonary edema requiring a brief intubation from
[**Date range (3) 96701**], then again from [**Date range (1) 96702**] for similar
presentation. During her admission on [**2143-3-6**], her home
nifedipine was discontinued and she was started on a BP regimen
of carvedilol/ lasix/ lisinopril. She was readmitted about a
week after with similar symptoms and findings consistent with
CHF exacerbation in setting for fluid overload, hypertension,
and flash pulmonary edema. She responded to BIPAP, lasix, nitro
gtt. She was discharged on Carvedilol 25mg by mouth twice a day.
The lisinopril was stopped at the time. Her discharge wt was
58.9 kg. She recently saw her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] [**Name11 (NameIs) 15618**] her lasix to

acute changes with an old LBB and CXR with pulm edema. Pt was
given Aspirin, Nitro gtt, vancomycin, and 40 mg iv furosemide.
She also got vanc and zosyn as CXR could not exclude PNA. She
put out 950cc. She was initially going to be admitted to the CCU
for Bipap, but she was able to be weaned off the bipap and was
conversing comfortably on 4L NC. She was felt to be appropriate
for the floor. VS prior to transfer: 150/75 75 18 97% on 4L. On

[**2143-4-8**] EKG:
Very marked baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia, rate 103.
Intraventricular conduction delay with left bundle-branch block
pattern and secondary ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2143-3-18**] probably no diagnostic interval
change.

[**2143-4-8**] Portable CXR:
CHEST, AP: There has been increase in diffuse interstitial and
airspace
pulmonary opacities, with confluent opacification in the left
upper lobe and lingula, as well as the right perihilar region.
Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged, with a tortuous and
calcified aorta. There are probable small bilateral pleural
effusions. The bones are diffusely demineralized, with
multilevel degenerative changes.
IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary opacities, likely representing
worsening
congestive heart failure, although underlying consolidation from

infection/aspiration, mass is not excluded.
