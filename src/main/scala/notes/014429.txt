CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ruptured aortic abdominal aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was shopping with
her husband. She had a syncopal episode. She was hypotensive.
The patient was transferred to a local emergency room and
then to our institution for surgical repair.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Toprol, Zocor and an over the counter
nonsteroidal for chronic back pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Illnesses include
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Chronic back pain.
3.  Hyperlipidemia on Zocor.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the emergency room vital signs:
98.5, 115, 20, blood pressure 70/40. General appearance: An
anxious female in no acute distress. Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination is unremarkable. Lungs are clear to
auscultation. Heart is regular rate and rhythm and
tachycardic. Abdominal examination is distended. Extremity
examination was without mottling. Pulse examination with
Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulses.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially seen in the
emergency room. Ultrasound of the abdomen was obtained and
found a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. The patient was
taken to emergent surgery. She underwent an open repair with
a tube graft and a jump graft from the tube graft to the left
femoral artery. The patient was then transferred intubated to
the surgical Intensive Care Unit for continued care. The
patient required initially fluid boluses multiple for low
urinary output with good response. The following early A.M.
the patient was noted to have mesenteric ischemia and she
returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and
ileocecotomy. The patient was placed on triple antibiotics
and Vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl. On postoperative day
her platelet count was noted to be low and a hit panel was
sent which was negative for initially the heparin was
discontinued and restarted once the result was known. Patient
required transfusion for blood loss anemia. She had elevated
liver function tests secondary to her peripheral propofol and
this was discontinued. She also had triglyceridemia secondary
to her propofol and this was converted to another [**Doctor Last Name 360**].
Total parenteral nutrition was begun. Patient was returned to
the operating room on [**2131-7-16**] because of pancreatitis.
She underwent an exploratory laparotomy of the greater an
lesser sac with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] tube placement and ileostomy and
mucous fistula. Patient returned to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit for continued care. The patient had an episode on
[**7-18**] of atrial fibrillation which responded to Lopressor.
Patient was rate controlled. The Swan was discontinued on
[**7-18**] and a central line was placed. Tube feeds were
started on [**7-19**].

Patient developed a temperature of 101.4 on [**7-20**]. Cultures
were sent. She returned to the operating room for open
abdominal exploration, wash out, VAC dressing placement and
discontinuation of the left pleural tube. On [**7-21**] the [**Location (un) 109**]
was discontinued. Patient had a transfusion reaction. On
[**7-25**] the fever work was continued. The blood cultures
grew gram positive cocci and yeast. The urine cultures grew
pseudomonas and yeast. Infectious disease was consulted for
recommendations as to appropriate antibiotics and therapy.
Cardiology was consulted for her recurrent atrial
fibrillation. The patient converted on her own. Her central
line was changed. Because of persistent fevers a CT of the
abdomen was obtained which did show fluid collections in the
lesser sac and a head CT was obtained which showed a basilar
cerebral artery aneurysm. On [**7-26**] the patient was
returned to operating room for exploratory laparotomy and
wash out with debridement of the pancreatic head and body.
Postoperatively she became hypotensive and required pressor
support. Pressors were weaned the next postoperative day and
she returned on [**7-29**] to the operating room for
exploratory laparotomy with wash out and a second pancreatic
debridement, VAC dressing placement. Her central line was
changed on [**7-29**] and she returned again that day for an
exploratory laparotomy for mid colic artery bleeding. On
[**7-31**] she went back to surgery again for exploratory
laparotomy and wash out with debridement of the pancreas and
VAC dressing placement.

On [**8-2**] the patient had a tracheostomy placed. On [**8-4**] and [**8-6**] she had wash out of the abdomen at bedside.
On [**8-7**] the VAC dressing was changed. On [**8-9**] the
patient underwent a split thickness skin graft to the lower
[**1-25**] of her abdominal wall without complication. Her central
line was changed at that time. The patient had been on Zosyn
and Flagyl since infectious disease consult and Zosyn was at
this time changed to Gentamicin. Patient VAC dressing was
changed again on [**8-14**] and a repeat CT scan was obtained
and a tracheostomy mask trial was begun. The patient's H2
blocker was discontinued because of persistent fevers. The
patient was required to go back on CPAP and on [**8-17**] was
weaned to a tracheostomy collar. On [**8-19**] the
tracheostomy was changed to a fenestrated tracheostomy. On
[**8-20**] ambulation with an abdominal binder was begun. The
patient required multiple fluid boluses for lower urinary
output and she was put back on bed rest.

She also complained of left eye vision loss. She was seen by
ophthalmology. Recommendations were to begin prednisone and
obtain a temporal artery biopsy for ischemic optic neuritis.
Neurology was also consulted at the same time. Multiple head
CTs were obtained. A speech and swallow evaluation was
obtained on [**8-21**] which was negative for aspiration and
the patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 46053**] Trache valve placed. Rheumatology
was consulted on [**8-23**] to add inputs to concern whether
the patient had an ischemic optic neuritis or whether she had
a giant cell arteritis. Their recommendations were to obtain
ultrasound of the carotids which showed less than 40%
stenosis bilaterally in the internal carotid arteries and to
do a temporal biopsy and if this was negative to take the
patient off her prednisone. On [**8-23**] the patient
underwent a left temporal artery biopsy. The results of this
were negative for giant cell arteritis. Neurology felt that
the patient's symptoms were related to her basilar cerebral
artery aneurysm and neurointerventional radiology was
requested to see the patient for consideration of coilization
of the artery. At this time the patient deferred treatment.
Steroids were discontinued. Recommendations were that the
patient after she recovers from her current hospitalization
course should follow up with neurointerventional radiology
for reconsideration of embolization of her cerebral artery
aneurysm.

The patient continued to run low grade fevers and cultures
did not show a source of infection. In fact, infectious
disease was reconsulted on [**7-27**] and they felt that this
was related to colonization and they would not recommend
restarting antibiotics. The patient continued to work with
physical therapy and occupational therapy while she was
hospitalized. She began bed to chair ambulation the day prior
to discharge to rehabilitation. The patient was discharged in
stable condition. Abdominal wound dressings were dry sterile
dressing with some tubes to suction. These are to remain on
suction and the dressing gets changed daily. The patient has
tracheostomy in place and routine tracheostomy care should be
provided. Downsizing of the tracheostomy can be done at the
rehabilitation.
