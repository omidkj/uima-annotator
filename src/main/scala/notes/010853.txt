RADIOLOGY:
CT TORSO [**2184-4-28**]:
Within the ascending aorta is a 9 cm  saccular aneurysm with
contained rupture into the middle mediastinum. There is no
evidence of aortic dissection. Additionally, within the
descending thoracic aorta is an 8 cm saccular aneurysm versus
pseudoaneurysm with mural thrombus. On this contrast-enhanced
study it does not appear that there is acute hemorrhage into the
wall of the aorta within the descending thoracic aneurysm. The
caliber of the aorta at the arch and inferior to the thoracic
aneurysm is normal. Again, the lung fields show diffuse
emphysematous changes bilaterally. There is minimal atelectasis
within the left lower lung lobe.
The airways are patent to the segmental level bilaterally. There
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no
pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. There is moderate calcified atherosclerotic
disease within the visualized thoracic aorta.

CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The abdominal aorta
is normal in caliber. A graft is seen within the infrarenal
portion of the aorta extending to the right and left iliac
arteries. There is heavy atherosclerotic calcification within
the iliac arteries and their branches, however, contrast is seen
within the femoral arteries distal to the bypass bilaterally.
Metallic clips are seen in the region of the aortic graft.

The liver contains a rounded 1 cm low density focus in the
posterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver, which likely
represents a simple renal cyst. A calcified focus in the
anterior aspect of the right lobe of the liver may represent a
hepatoartery pseudo aneurysm versus a granuloma. The
gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and right adrenal gland are
unremarkable. Again, the left kidney is not seen, however, the
right kidney contains multiple exophytic and intraparenchymal
cysts, the largest measuring 10 cm and is located in the upper
pole. The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large
bowel are unremarkable. There is no evidence for bowel
dilatation. There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid within
the abdomen. There is no free air.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, and
intrapelvic
loops of small and large bowel are normal in appearance and
caliber. There is an enhancing mass in the anterior aspect of
the bladder measuring 2.5 x 3.4 cm. There is no pathologically
enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.
The visualized aortic branches are heavily calcified.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.
Degenerative changes are seen within the thoracolumbar spine.

CT REFORMATS: Coronal, sagittal, volume rendered images were
essential in
delineating the anatomy and pathology of this case. Value grade
V.

IMPRESSION:

1. Ascending saccular aortic aneurysm measuring 9 cm and
demonstrating a
contained acute hemorrhagic rupture into the middle mediastinum.

2. Additional descending thoracic aortic saccular aneurysm
versus pseudo-
aneurysm without evidence for acute intramural hematoma.
3. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the aorta
with
infrarenal aortoiliac bypass graft, demonstrating patency to the
femoral
arteries bilaterally.
4. Very atrophic left kidney with multiple intraparenchymal and
exophytic
cysts of the right kidney.
5. Enhancing small anterior bladder mass which could represent a
polyp or
mass

CARDIOLOGY:
[**2184-4-28**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest consistent with the presence
of a small secundum type atrial septal defect. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2184-4-29**] Catheterization:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a right dominant system
with
LMCA that had a 50-60% lesion. The LAD had sequential 70%
proximal and
50% lesions with post-stenotic dilatations and was severely
calcified.
LCX had a high OM1 with 50% stenosis and a mid-vessel 70%
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment was limited and showed normal aortic
systemic

Brief Hospital Course:
