[**2196-10-11**] CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
1. Ascending colon wall thickness, fat stranding, and pericolic
fluid are concerning for ascending colon colitis.
2. Cirrhosis with evidence of portal venous hypertension.
3. Left kidney hypoattenuating lesion for which ultrasound is
recommended to further characterize.

[**2196-10-11**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)
1. No evidence of cholecystitis.
2. No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilatation.
3. Cirrhosis. Findings equivocal for portal venous hypertension.

Labs:
[**2196-10-13**] Stool - C Diff positive

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo F with a h/o primary biliary cirrhosis c/b past esophageal
variceal bleed (listed for transplant at [**Hospital1 336**]), idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura, originally transferred from outside
hospital with fever and hypotension. She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to the ICU.
.
# Fever/hypotension: It was thought that her fever and
hypotension were related to ascending colon colitis.  She was
briefly on levophed but was quickly tapered off prior to
arriving in the ICU.  She was started flagyl/zosyn in the ED for
colitis.  While in the ICU, stool cultures came back positive
for c diff.  Her antibiotics were then changes to flagyl/unasyn.
 She was doing well was transferred to the medicine floor.  Her
antibiotics were narrowed to just flagyl.  She continued to do
well and was discharged to complete a 14 day course of PO
flagyl.
.
# Anemia - the patients anemia was felt to be related to chronic
disease.  It remained stable at approximately 30 throughout her
hospital course.
.
# Primary biliary cirrhosis:  Currently stable, pt continued on
urosdiol and rifaximin.  She was prepped for a colonoscopy for
workup prior to transplant but this was cancelled because her
stool was positive for c diff.
.
# ITP:  Patient with known ITP.  Her platelets were stable
around 30 throughout her hospital course.  She had no signs of
active bleed.
