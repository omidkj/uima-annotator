Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
knee pain, fevers, concern for acute leukemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2123-5-10**]: PICC line placement
[**2123-5-13**]: Bronchoscopy
[**2123-5-14**]: Pericardiocentesis and cardiac catherization
[**2123-5-19**]: Central line placement
[**2123-5-24**]: Lumbar puncture
[**2123-6-16**]: EGD and sigmoidoscopy
[**2123-5-11**] and [**2123-6-11**]: Bone marrow biopsy


History of Present Illness:
43M with history of GERD and chronic right knee pain who
initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2123-5-7**] with
progressively worsening right knee pain/swelling with presumed
septic artritis and meniscal injury, whose course was
complicated by pneumonia, neutropenic fever, and concern for
acute leukemia, and who is transferred now to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation including bone marrow biopsy.  He has a history of
chronic intermittent right knee pain since age 16, when he
underwent arthroscopic surgery.  In [**Month (only) 359**], he exacerbated his
right knee pain while participating in physical therapy for his
back.  Plan was for arthroscopic surgery in Novemeber, but this
was delayed when he developed swelling in the setting of a jaw
infection, requiring a 4 day hospital admission, IV antibiotics
and oral surgery with teeth removal.  Plan was for knee surgery
to proceed on [**2123-5-20**], however approximately one week ago he
developed progressively worsening knee pain and swelling, to the
point where he was unable to bear weight.  Saw his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**]
ordered an ultrasound that per report was negative for DVT or
cyst in RLE.  Was recommended he take ibuprofen.  However, pain
worsened and he went to ED at [**Hospital3 **] on [**5-7**]. There for T
101.5 he was started with vanc,ctx and underwent R knee
aspiration demonstrating synovial WC of 13K with 26 PMNs. At
that time CBC showed WBC 19.5 with 5%N and 53% monos. At OSH
underwent tap of knee.  Was taken by Ortho to OR on [**2123-5-7**],
with cultures unremarkable, fluid did not show signifiant
neutrophils but did have significant WBC mostly monos and
macros.  Gram stain showed GPCs.  Was followed by ID consulting
team, who felt this was concerning for septic arthritis despite
low WBC.  Chest CT [**5-8**] showed no evidence of PE but did show
some signs of evolving right sided pneumonia. PT then spiked
fever to 102.8, started  on vanc/imipenem/azithro for
neutropenic fever although cultures with no growth to date.

Also during this time, was noted to have significant
leukocytosis, with WBC 19 on admission, up to 26.4 on [**5-8**] with
diff 5%N, 1band, 14lymph, 80 monos. Was seen by Heme/Onc
consultants, who had concern for acute leukemia. Uric acid was
7.1. Family requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup
including bone marrow biopsy.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is drowsy but arousable.  Reports
intermittent fevers/chills, and diffuse pain most notable in
right knee.  Had nausea/vomiting yesterday, now improved.
Non-productive cough and dyspnea since yesterday, as well as a
dull chest pain in region of lower left ribs.

ONLY PERTINENT +VE: VIRAL CULTURE: R/O CYTOMEGALOVIRUS (Final
[**2123-6-2**]):
RHINOVIRUS. PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION.

PERTINENT IMAGING:
CXR [**5-10**]: The patient has a right-sided PICC line. Tip of the
line is
difficult to visualize but appears to terminate in the lower
SVC. There is no evidence of complications, notably no
pneumothorax, the course of the catheter is unremarkable. The
lung volumes are low. An area of retrocardiac atelectasis is
seen. In addition, entire right hemithorax is showing increased
radiodensity, which is presumably caused by patient positioning.
Mild enlargement of the left atrium. Borderline cardiomegaly
with mild fluid overload. No larger pleural effusions. No
evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

TTE [**5-11**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 65%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No right atrial
o
