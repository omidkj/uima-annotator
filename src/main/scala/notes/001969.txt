History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19442**] was an 88 year old man who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
with 2 days of right sided abdominal pain.  He was transferred

- s/p R CEA in [**2191**] (by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]-patient says he was
asymptomatic, but notes indicate prior TIA
- CRI 2.9; [**2196-1-17**] ARF/CRI with Cr to 5.4 -> 2.2 with IVFs; Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 33568**] - nephrologist following, unclear etiology.
- hyperPTH - most likely [**1-19**] to CRI/ARF,
- anemia, ? GI bleed with full ASA. Pt also started on Epo while
as inpatient during his admission in [**Month (only) 205**].
- MM, per patient, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 33569**], his heme/onc Md [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 33570**].


Social History:
Former smoker-quit [**2167**], 4 cigarettes per day x 40 years. 1
scotch per day. NO IVDU or recreational drugs.

Family History:
No hx of MI, CAD, CVA, DM, HTN


Physical Exam:
T 100.6/98.9 P 75, BP 138/61, RR 26, Sat 97 on 4L NC
Decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally
Heart rate regular
Abdomen mildly distended and tympanitic.  Right upper and lower
quadrant tenderness to mild palpation with guarding.
Rectal exam with normal tone, brown, trace heme-positive stool.

Pertinent Results:
[**5-8**] RUQ U/S: Findings most consistent with acute cholecystitis,
as discussed with General Surgery houseofficer, and posted to
the ED dashboard, at the time of dictation

[**5-8**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1. Inflammatory process involving the
right upper abdomen as described, which appears more likely
centered on a distended gallbladder with sludge and stones,
rather than on the ascending colonic diverticula, though there
is a spastic-appearing colonic segment in the vicinity.
2. Evidence of chronic pancreatitis with calcifications and
atrophy.
3. No evidence of inflammatory process in the right lower
abdomen.
4. Extensive vascular calcification with no aneurysms seen.
5. Small-moderate right pleural effusion with basilar
atelectasis.

[**5-10**] Cholecystostomy: Successful ultrasound-guided percutaneous
cholecystostomy tube placement. 200 cc of bilious fluid was
aspirated, a portion which was sent for microbiology.

[**5-11**] RUQ U/S: Large biloma in gallbladder fossa with
decompressed gallbladder with thickened, ruptured wall. Findings
including possible percutaneous drainage of the biloma were
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at completion of
examination

[**5-11**]: CT Abdomen/Pelvis: 1.Compared to prior CT from [**2198-5-8**],
there is increased eccentric fluid collection adjacent to the
anterolateral aspect of the gallbladder fundus with marked
pericholeycstic stranding, concerning for rupture. In addition,
since the prior exam, the patient has developed increased
peripancreatic stranding, which may be related to the
gallbladder, however, an acute pancreatitis cannot be entirely
excluded. No pancreatic ductal dilatation or stone within the
duct is identified. Recommend correlation with pancreatic
enzymes.
2. Bilateral ground-glass opacity and pleural effusion with an
area of consolidation within the right lung base.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19442**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and cared for in the Trauma SICU.  He and his wife initially
declined surgery and cholecystostomy tube; he ultimately did
receive cholecystostomy tube once his status declined.   This
was performed on HD3.  He became anuric with an elevated lactate
after placement of this drain, receiving 8 L of IV fluids, and
forming only 500 cc of urine despite lasix.  His blood pressure
dropped, and he required increasing amounts of Levophed.  He was
then intubated for increased work of breathing.  On HD4, Mr.
[**Known lastname 19442**] was brought ot the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an
exploratory laparotomy, cholecystectomy, and hemodialysis line
placement.  Details of this procedure may be found in his
operative note.  Postoperatively, he became hypotensive and
developed pulseless electrical activity.  After 60 minutes of
resuscitation, he recovered a perfusing rhythm.  The patient's
family was notified, and the decision was made to change his
code status to DNR.  At 1802, his code status was changed to
CMO, and he soon expired after pharmacologic supports were
withdrawn.
