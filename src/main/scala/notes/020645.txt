History of Present Illness:
77 y/o gentleman with SOB and black stools.  He presented to OSH
on [**2193-8-30**] with sudden onset SOB that began while reurning from
the bathroom. His wife reported he had worsening DOE for
previous 3 days. He also reported having dark stools. He denied,
CP, cough, fevers, or chills.  At OSH he was found to have right
heart strain and CT PE demonstrated bilateral PEs.  Pt was not
given heparin at OSH [**1-31**] h/o GI bleeding, however his H/H was
wnl.  He was given protonix gtt, octreotide, and levaquin.  At
OSH his HR was 137 and BP was 115/65 he was given 1 unit of
blood and 4L crystalloid. He was flown to [**Hospital1 18**], On arrival he
was started on heparin drip. Bedside echocardiography
demonstrated right heart strain, and ultrasound of the lower
right limb demonstrated a proximal femoral clot. He was urgently
taken to the cath lab where he received an IVC filter.  His PA
pressure was noted to be in the 70s. Catheter directed lysis of
embolus with TPA infusion resulted in a drop of the PA pressure
to 50s.  Patient was transferred to the CCU where he remained
tachypnic, tachycardic and hypotensive and distressed.  It was
noted that his lower extremities appeared mottled and cool.
Central venous access was obtained and he was started on
dobutamine and nipride, and BiPAP.

ECHO (TTE) [**2193-8-30**]
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function appears normal (LVEF>50%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with depressed free wall contractility (the RV apical function
is preserved/[**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign suggestive of acute pulmonary
embolism/RV strain). Tricuspid regurgitation is present but
cannot be quantified. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: RV strain pattern suggestive of acute pulmonary
embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
      Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 y/o gentleman with h/o DVT, GIB and
hyperlipidemia who presented to an OSH on [**2193-8-30**] with SOB and
bilateral pulmonary emboli on CTPE.  He was transfered to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED and was found to have signs of right heart strain on
bedside ECHO.  He urgently underwent catheter directed
thrombolysis with TPA and IVC filter placement.
.
# Pulmonary Emboli: Patient tachypneic with signs of severe RV
strain s/p catheter thrombolysis and IVC filter placement. We
continued heparin drip for despite initial concerns for GIB.  He
had an IVC filter placed, but the filter was removed on [**8-30**] at
the time the ECMO was instituted.  He went to the cath lab on
[**9-5**] for possible thrombectomy; there was improvement in the size
of the emboli bilaterally and no thrombectomy was performed.
.
# GIB: Pt presented with dark stools, reported guiac + in OSH
and [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Hx of prior GIB, given octreotide at OSH. Given
cardiogenic shock, currently benefits of heparin gtt outweigh
risks.  His HCT was monitored carefully and he was transfused
when HCT <24.  In addition, PLTs were maintained >100 while
patient was on ECMO.  His hospital course was c/b nasopharyngeal
bleeding requiring packing by ENT.  He was treated with
cefazolin while packing was in place.
.
# Cardiogenic/Obstructive Shock: On arrival to the CCU,
laboratory data demonstrated a Lactate of 2.8, which trended up
to 4, Elevated Transanimases which improved to WNL by [**9-7**]. High
SVR and low Cardiac Index on arrival to the CCU. Dobutamine was
started with mild improvement in CI. Nitroprusside started for
vasodilation to reduce RV afterload with improvement in
peripheral perfusion. Maintaining high-flow O2 (tolerating
BiPAP), also to assist with pulmonary vasodilation.
     Over the following 12 hours, he became increasingly
hemodynamically unstable.  A TTE showed a RV strain pattern
suggestive of acute pulmonary embolism (LVEF 50%).  He converted
to AF with RVR during which time he became hypotensive requiring
cardioversion.  He was taken urgently to the cath lab, but on
the way he suffered a PEA arrest, chest compressions were
performed and ROSC.  He was placed on ECMO with cannulations of
the IJ with catheters both in the RA and RV and another cannula
in his right Femoral artery (to allow for both VV and VA ECMO
support).  He was maintained on ECMO from [**8-30**] to [**9-5**] during
which time there was interval improvement in his RV function on
echo. This course was c/b AF requiring cardioversion and
Amiodarone gtt, and hypotension requiring pressors.  At this
point he was switched over from ECMO to a tandem heart ([**9-5**]).
Attempts to diurese resulted in hypotension.  At this point, it
was felt that although he was grossly volume overloaded, he was
actually intravascularly depleted and diuresis was discontinued.
 We attempted to re-initiate diuresis on subsequent days when
CXRs continued to show pulomonary edema, but we were not able to
maintain adequate MAPs, even on two pressors.  After a
discussion with his family, his code status was changed to DNR.
On [**9-9**], his family asked us to begin withdrawing care.  He was
