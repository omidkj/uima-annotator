aortic valve. Cross-clamp time was 51 minutes. Total bypass
time was 57 minutes. He was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition on Neo and propofol. He had a stable postoperative
night but then had some delirium on postoperative day one. He
was seen by Psychiatry and was restarted on his azipramine.
He also had some increased chest tube drainage on his
postoperative night and was treated with two units of cells
and one of platelets and protamine. He was extubated on his
postoperative night and was on some Neo. He went into atrial
fibrillation and was converted quickly to sinus rhythm on an
amiodarone drip. He was changed to p.o. on postoperative day
