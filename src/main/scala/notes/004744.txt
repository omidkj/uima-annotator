Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular tachycardia ablation
Neosynephrine for low BPs

History of Present Illness:
The Pt is a 67 y/o M witha PMH of DM c/b peripheral neuropathy,
ulcers, and amputation, a history of a pro-coaguable disorder
requiring chronic prophylaxis with enoxaparin admitted with BKA
erythema and concern for stump infection. The pt has a right BKA
with increased erythema of the stump. His home nurse referred
him to the ED today after noting discharge. He also has had
worsening diarrhea with 4-5 loose stools daily with 2-3 at
baseline. No blood in stool. No fever or chills. The patient had
a pattern of frequenst distal stump infections in the past and
prolonged admission several months ago with left foot ulcer,
cellulitis, sepsis, septic saphenous phlebitis.
.
In the ED, initial vitals 97.5, HR 78, BP 103/56, RR 18, O2 sat
100%. He was given Vancomycin 1gm IV X1 and admitted to the
medical floor. On arrival to the floor the patient triggered for
SBP of 70. He received 1L NS on route to MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patients SBP responded initially to
IVF. However his SBP dropped to 70s systolic and he was started
on peripheral neosynephrine. In the setting of low BP he had a
run of sustained VT. He received lidocaine X1 with returned of V
paced rhythm. EP consulted and recommended lidocaine gtt.

Brief Hospital Course:
66yoM with DMII, Ischemic CM, PVD s/p R BKA admitted with
sepsis, likely [**1-27**] to cellulitis c refractory VT
.
Floor Course: Pt triggered upon arrival to the floor for
hypotension. The pt was evaluated by the MICU team and
[**Hospital 66515**] transferred to the unit.
.
ICU Course:
# Sepsis: Upon admission to the unit the pt was febrile,
tachycardiac and hypoetensive. The pt was bolused with IVF. A L
IJ was placed and pt was on phenylephrine overnight with MAP
goals in the 70s. The pts WBC increased from 20K to 30K
overnight. The source of infection was skin/soft tissue
infection versus recurrent C. Diff. The patients R BKA appeared
erythematous and was tender to palpation posteriorly and
inferiorly. Vascular surgery was consulted. The pt was started
on Vanc/Zosyn and PO Vanc. The pt's WBC improved over his MICU
stay and he remained afebrile. Upon discharge from the MICU the
patients R BKA appeared clinically less erythematous.
.
# Refractory VT: Pt had runs of VT the night of admission to the
MICU in the setting of sepsis while on pressors. Pt given
Lidocaine bolus, started on a drip and EP was consulted. The pt
was started on Amiodarone, Mexilitine PO, however the pt had
repeated runs of NSVT so pt kept on Lidocaine drip. Pt was later
taken for VT ablation by EP. Substrate was ablated however VT
could not be induced per report. Post ablation pt had repeated
runs of NSVT and placed back on Lidocaine drip and PO
amiodarone. The pt was kept intubated post procedure for 18hrs
as his BP stabilized and was briefly put back on pressors. Pt
was transitioned to PO Mexilitine with 24 hr overlap with
Lidocaine drip. The drip was subsequently d/c'd.
.
# Cardiomyopathy. The patient arrived to the unit on 2L NC. Over
the course of his MICU course he was given IVF via his
antibiotics and pt slowly became overloaded R>L as evident by
CXR and increased 02 requirement up to 5L. The pt was diuresed
and subsequently transferred back to the floor on 2L NC.
.
# Diarrhea: Pt has hx of short gut and has loose stools at
baseline. However, pt has hx of refractory C Diff and thus was
placed on PO Vanc as prophylaxis while on Vanc/Zosyn for
Cellulitis. Pt was given Metamucil Wafers to increase the
consistency of his stools which slightly alleviated his
symptoms.

Course on the Cardiology Service:

#Sepsis
Patient presented from MICU Afebrile, hemodynamically stable off
pressers. WBC down to 22K and remained around 20 for full
course.  Extremities much less erythematous.  Vanc level 40.0
and thus vanc held for remainder of 10 day course. He was also
continued on Zosyn for 10 day course.

#. Loose stools: Patient continued to have loose stools on the
floor. C diff was negative x 3. Was continued on PO Vanc until
CDiff cultures were negative times 3. Was started back on
cholestyramine for short gut syndrome - which he had been on in
the past.

# Refractory VT ??????  Ventricular Paced when on the floor. Was
followed by the EP service and was started on mexilitine and
amiodarone. Had several 5-10beat runs of NSVT always
asymptomatic with normal vital signs. Will follow up with the EP
service in [**Month (only) **] for further titration of his medications and
consideration of ICD placement.

# Cardiomyopathy / R Pleural effusion O2 sats improved to 99% on
RA while on the floor after diuresis in the MICU. Remained
euvolemic and never required repeat thoracentesis as O2 sats
were 99% on RA. Will be continued on lasix 20mg daily as
outpatient.

# UTI with yeast: Was started on miconazole cream [**Hospital1 **] for 14
days as well as fluconazole PO daily. His EKG was monitored over
the first 24 hours that he got the fluconazole for QT
prolongation. His QTc remained stable so he was continued on the
full 14day course of fluconazole ending on [**2131-10-19**].

# CRI (Stage IIII):  CrCl between 20-40s. Creatinine stable and
within baseline

# DMII: Continued home dose NPH, ISS while in house.

# Leukocytosis: continued to be at his baseline of low 20s.  [**Month (only) 116**]
consider outpatient heme/onc workup however at this time this is
unlikely secondary to an acute infection as patient has no
fever.

# Pleural Effusion: Has known pleural effusion that has been
stable. The patient had O2 sats 100% on RA prior to discharge
with stable appearance of effusion on CXR.

# Hypercoagulability: On lovenox and no aspirin.

# Depression: Mood stable. Continued Citalopram

# FEN: Continue regular, heart healthy diet
