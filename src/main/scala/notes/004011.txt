Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Code stroke: found by wife in the morning to be unresponsive,
non-communicative and to have left sided weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 76 yo M with history of pAfib on coumadin, CHF (EF
10-15%), Prostate CA, stroke, who presents with acute onset left
sided weakness, drowsiness and inability to speak.

Over the past several weeks, he had been experiencing increased
SOB and difficulty climbing stairs. He has been followed by his
cardiologist who had scheduled a cardiac cath for this morning.
In that setting he had been holding his coumadin since Monday
and was not taking other anticoagulation or antiplatelets.

This morning his wife woke him up around 5am to come in for the
catheterization and found him unresponsive. He was also
apparently not moving his left side. She tried to waken him up
but he would not open his eyes. He did not interact purposefully
at that time and apparently could not communicate.

EMS was called and he was brought to the ED at which time code
stroke was called. His NIHSS was calculated to be 15, he
underwent CT/CTA/CTP which revealed extensive clot from R ICA
above the bifurcation to the R MCA with area of hypodensity.
Given the time course of the time of last known well >8hrs, tPA
was not given; interventional thrombectomy/lysis was considered
and extensively discussed but given the time course and the
unfavorable risk/benefit assessment ultimately was not pursued.

While awaiting assessment in the ED, the patient's respiratory
status became tenuous with shallow breathing. He was responsive
only to vigorous sternal rub. He was therefore intubated and
sedated for airway protection.

ROS was not possible in this setting.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD status post MI in [**2136-3-24**], [**2136-8-24**], [**2137**]. He
has known 3VD. He is status post PTCA of the left circ and OM1
in 4/00. He is status post PTCA stent of the ramus in 5/00. In
[**8-/2136**] he had restent of the ramus and stent in the proximal LAD.
In 11/00 he had PTCA of the left circ. His last stress was in
[**11/2136**]. He exercised four minutes, 48% exercise capacity, no
anginal symptoms, no EKG changes. He had a fixed defect in the
anterior septal region.
2. History of obstructive jaundice status post ERCP in [**Month (only) 547**]
[**2135**] with sphincterotomy and extraction of common bile duct
stone.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Depression.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. CVA: ischemic left middle cerebral artery territory infarct
in his posterior frontal lobe with subsequent right hemiparesis.
Suspected cardioembolic source. On long-term Coumadin.
8. Systolic HF, last EF 25% on TTE [**12-27**].
9. Prostate CA
[**45**]. Right inguinal hernia repair

Social History:

HEAD AND NECK CTA [**9-6**]
Thrombus within the right intracranial ICA extending over the
supraclinoid ICA
and bifurcation with thrombus in the right M1 segment of the
middle cerebral
artery. The right ICA is not opacified through the petrous
segment, but this
may reflect decreased flow due to the distal thrombus rather
than thrombosis
of this segment of the vessel as there is no hyperdense thrombus
visualized in
this segment of the artery. Corresponding decreased cerebral
blood flow and
blood volume in the right middle cerebral artery distribution.
There is distal
collateral flow. Origin of the thrombus may be from extensive
soft plaque in
the proximal cervical internal carotid artery.

Occluded right vertebral artery from its origin through the V4
segment, where
it is distally reconstituted.

No intracranial hemorrhage.

HEAD AND NECK MRI [**9-6**]
FINDINGS:  There is slow diffusion within the entire right
middle cerebral
artery territory, compatible with acute/subacute ischemia.
Hyperintense
signal is seen within the right internal carotid artery
extending from the
distal cervical portion through the bifurcation and also in the
middle
cerebral artery on th
