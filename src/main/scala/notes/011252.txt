Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 66-year-old
female who was initially admitted on [**2178-11-12**],
complaining of increased weakness and groin pain since nine
days prior to admission when she had a fall.  Since the fall,
the patient had been basically confined to her bedroom, did
not drink or eat, and lived on some water, coffee, cigarettes
and occasional beer.  According to her family, the patient
had been not very mobile for some time prior to admission,
mostly because of severe exertional dyspnea.  However,
despite her dyspnea, she continued to smoke two packs of
cigarettes per day.

On admission, the patient denied any fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, dizziness, chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Significant for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, history of vitamin B12
deficiency.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Tiazac 240 per day, Premarin
0.625 mg per day, Provera 2.5 mg per day, clonazepam 1 mg
three times a day, Atrovent two puffs four times a day,
albuterol four puffs four times a day, Ventolin as needed.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Lives alone, lifelong smoker, at least two
packs per day.  Drinks ethanol on a regular basis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, vital signs 97.7, blood
pressure 90/60, heart rate 101, respiratory rate 29, oxygen
saturation 90% on 2 liters.  In general, she was alert and
oriented x 3, very cachectic, in no apparent distress.  Her
pupils were equal, reactive, responsive to light and
accommodation, extraocular muscles were intact, oropharynx
was clear.  The skin was without rashes.  The neck showed no
jugular venous distention, no bruits.  The lungs showed
decreased air movement and were wheezy.  Heart regular rate
and rhythm plus murmur.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
with normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities were clear, no
clubbing, cyanosis or edema, good pulses distally.
Neurological examination was nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, significant for a white
blood cell count of 23.7, hematocrit 43.5, platelets 651.
Liver function tests were normal.  Chemistries were normal.
Creatinine 0.5.  Chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe
infiltrate.  Hip films were suspicious for a left femoral
neck fracture.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 66-year-old female with severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, who
presented with right upper lobe pneumonia and a possible left
hip fracture and generalized weakness.  She is a long-time
smoker, and has also had ethanol abuse on a regular basis.

She was given intravenous fluids, antibiotics, levofloxacin
intravenously, nebulizer therapy, inhalers and oxygen.  She
was put on ethanol and nicotine withdrawal precautions, given
deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and was seen by
Orthopaedic Surgery consult.  Orthopaedic service decided to
treat her left hip fracture nonoperatively because it was
stable and impacted in an acceptable but not ideal position.
Pinning the hip in that position would have been technically
difficult and has drawbacks and, because of her severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia, it was
decided to avoid surgery.  She was discontinued from her
Premarin because this increases the risk of deep venous
thrombosis.  She would need to walk with a walker for four to
six more weeks, for which she would need a rehabilitation
hospital or home care with services.

On [**11-15**], the patient was found to have oxygen saturations as
low as 53%.  She was placed on 100% non-rebreather, which
improved her saturations to 100%.  The patient was noted to
have a weak cough.  Oral/nasal suctioning was started, and
the patient was breathing better.  Changed to 4 liters of
nasal cannula oxygen, saturating 95%.  However, she continued
to be more somnolent and difficult to arouse.  An arterial
blood gas showed a pH of 7.3, PCO2 89, PO2 200 on 100%
non-rebreather.  Chest x-ray showed worsening right upper
lobe pneumonia.

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further airway management.  She did not tolerate
BiPAP secondary to depressed mental status and secretions,
and therefore was intubated for pulmonary toilet and more
adequate respiration to protect mental status.

Later that day, after a lengthy discussion with the son,
[**Name (NI) 1704**], and daughter, [**Name (NI) **], it was learned that the patient
had been completely noncompliant with medical care prior to
admission.  Her oldest daughter, [**Name (NI) **], is her health care
proxy, but feels that [**Name (NI) 1704**] should be making the medical
decision, as Mrs. [**Known lastname 4427**] lives with him and is close to him.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 4427**] had previously expressed to her primary care
physician that she wanted to have all medical interventions,
but no be on a breathing machine for a prolonged period of
time.  Given her acute decompensation and pneumonia, there
was reversible component to her situation, however, it was
explained to them the severity of the underlying lung disease
and the chance of prolonged intubation.  [**Doctor First Name **] expressed that
her mother has been severely depressed for the past 15 years,
since her husband and two children died, and has been
committing slow suicide by abusing her body with tobacco,
ethanol and caffeine.  She has refused interventional therapy
or medication.  It was decided at that point that she would
be made Do Not Resuscitate, but would continue on the
ventilator.

The patient continued to be treated with Levaquin and Flagyl
for possible aspiration pneumonia, and was continued on the
respirator, but had a difficult time being weaned from the
ventilator.  Chest x-ray showed emphysematous blebs in her
left lower lobe, and continuing right pleural effusion that
layered.

By [**11-19**], her pressure support on the ventilator was
decreased to 10, although she failed a spontaneous breathing
trial.  Pleural effusion was stable, acid fast bacilli
negative x 3.  She was evaluated by Nutrition, and started on
tube feeds, Impact with fiber at 40 cc/hour.

On [**11-20**], she had to be placed back on pressure support of 12
and 5 because of failure to tolerate the lower pressures.
Plans were made on that day for percutaneous tracheostomy if
she continued to fail her wean.  She was treated for eight
out of 21 days with levofloxacin and eight of 14 days with
Flagyl.

She continued to demonstrate difficulties in weaning from the
ventilator.  Atrovent was added on [**11-22**], and she was
continued on her antibiotics.

On [**11-21**], it was discussed with the family and it was decided
that it would be attempted to avoid tracheostomy and attempt
ventilatory wean because the wishes of the patient and the
family were to not have long-term intubation on a
tracheostomy, and that she would not want to be reintubated.
However, a short trial of pressure support [**3-28**] with increased
respiration, decreased tidal volume, subsequent arterial
blood gas of 7.31/84/54, and the patient had to be put back
on pressure support of 15 with 5 of PEEP.  She spiked to 101
and was cultured, grew 4+ gram-positive cocci, and the
patient was started on vancomycin over concern for
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus.

She continued to fail spontaneous breathing trial on [**11-23**].
The trach issue was discussed with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and the family.  On [**11-24**], she
tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial for two hours, but
the required increased ventilation assist control overnight.
This was day ten of intubation, on [**11-24**].  She was
continued on antibiotics, continued on tube feeds,
prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis.

On [**11-24**], later in the day, Mrs. [**Known lastname 4427**] was able to
communicate her wishes to proceed with a trach and a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube, and her son
consented for the procedures.  L
