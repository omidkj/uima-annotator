History of Present Illness:
57 M with PMHx of alcoholic ESLD on [**Telephone/Fax (1) **] list, esophageal
varices transferred from [**Hospital1 336**] for further evaluation of TIPs
procedure. Patient originally presented to [**Hospital 107**] Hospital
with hematemasis which started at 3am [**2145-8-31**]. Per wife his last
drink was 2 years ago. She reports he was in USOH (occasional
weakenss) until he started vomiting clear which subsequently
turned red that morning and he had abdominal pain, became
lightheaded, and almost passed out. At [**Hospital1 107**] he had hct 21.6,
given 6 units PRBCs and 4 units of FFP for INR of 3.  He was
also given IVF for BP as low as 78/50. There he became ?pulselss
for 1 min vs resp arrest ? aspiration. He had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 10045**] placed
and intubated for AMS and airway protection. At [**Hospital1 336**] he was
given 1 bag of platelets hct 44.9--->31.6, INR of 1.8 on
admission [**Doctor Last Name **] given 5mg VitK subQ for 3 days. He was noted to be
bleeding from nose and mouth. Scoped by GI and found blood in
stomach and ulcer in lower third of esophagus. He received zosyn
prophylactically. Scoped by ENT and found nothing. Given 6LNS.
.
He had recent hospitalization and [**Hospital1 18**] for GIB [**Date range (1) 74682**]
attributed to portal hypertensive gastropathy and small ulcers
where he had previous bands. He also had ARF that was thought to
be pre-renal in origin.
.
Currently, patient was sedated. He was given 450mcg of fentanyl
in transit as his propofol was turned off for "labile blood
pressure." Wife was called and the history was confirmed upon
arrival
.
ROS: could not be obtained because of sedation

Pertinent Results:
MICROBIOLOGY: [**9-1**] sputum cx OSH GPV in pairs
[**9-1**] UCx pending
.
STUDIES:
EKG:  NSR at 75, NA, prolonged QT but no acute STTW changes
.
CXR: ET in right main bronchus with LLL collapse
.
CXR OSH [**9-1**]: increase density behind the heart on the right
that may represent aspiration pneumonia
.
EGD [**7-10**] Varices at the distal esophagus(not bleeding)
Mosaic pattern in the diffuse compatible with chronic gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum.
.
EGD [**8-14**]: Lesions 3 cords of grade II varices were seen in the
lower third of the esophagus. Three bands were placed with
success.
Mosaic appearance in the stomach compatible with mild portal
hypertensive gastropathy. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of
the duodenum
.
EG [**8-27**] Portal gastropathy
Varices appeared to be obliterated without need for further
banding. There was evidence of three ulcers, two of which
appeared to have band from previous EGD underneath. Otherwise
normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**8-31**] EGD OSH: scar found in lower third of esophagus due to a
prior intervention, ulcer found in the lower third of the
esophagus, blood in entire stomach, portal gastropathy in entire
stomach, hiatal hernia
.
[**9-1**] OSH abd U/S: thrombosis of mail portal vein extending
retrograde into extrahepatic portal vein to the level of the
portal. Cirrhosis with moderate ascites and splenomegaly, patent
hepativ vein, hepatic artery and IVC.
.
[**9-1**] renal U/s: no hydronephrosis

Multiple other studies no documented


Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo M with PMHx of alcoholic ESLD on [**Month/Year (2) **] list,
esophageal varices transferred from [**Hospital1 336**] for further evaluation
of TIPs procedure after GI bleed. His hospital stay was 96 days.
In that time he had an orthotopic liver [**Hospital1 **] and developed
a severe cardiomyopathy and passed due to cardiopulmonary
collapse.

BY PROBLEM

# GI Bleed
# hx of Varices
# Esophageal Ulcer
: Based on the endoscopy at [**Hospital1 3278**], this was likely an upper GI
bleed from an ulceration that arose from a former esophageal
varix banding site. He was transferred for TIPS eval and did not
have any more GIB.

# Hospital Acquired/Aspiration Pneumonia
Mechanical Ventilation: The patient arrived intubated for airway
protection, and remained intubated because of poor mental
status/wakefulness. He had a possible infiltrate on cxr and was
treated for eight days with piperacillin-tazobactam based on a
sputum gram stain that showed gram negative rods. After he
showed more wakefulness and followed commands and was ultimately
extubated. Reintubated following OLT and extubated after OLT
(week).  Though he remained on broad spectrum antibiotics, he
never required re-intubation until is cardiopulmonary collapse

# ESLD/Encephalopathy:
Portal Vein Thrombosis
s/p Orthotopic Liver Transplantation
Thrombocytopenia
Coagulopathy
 Complicated by variceal bleeds and hepatic encephalopathy. He
was stabilized and received a liver [**Hospital1 **].

#Fever and Hypothermia/Sepsis
# Klebsiella Sepsis
# VRE Sepsis
# [**Female First Name (un) 564**] UTI/Urosepsis
 Pt had several episodes of sirs vs septic shock and was on
pressors, broad spectrum antibiotics until the end of his course

# Acute Kidney Injury, ESRD
# Hepatorenal Syndrome
# Dialysis Dependance
The patient had an elevated creatinine that was consistent with
hypovolemia and prerenal azotemia. He improved at first and then
developed hepatorenal syndrome and was dialysis depenedant.

# Dilated Cardiomyopathy: patient discoved to have ef of [**9-16**]%
post-operatively; declined for heart [**Date Range **] at [**Hospital1 **].

# Ventricular Tachycardia: patient on amiodarone, required
lidocaine drip prior to death

MICU Course:
A 57 year old gentleman with ESLD admitted 59 days earlier for
upper GI bleeding re-readmitted to the ICU for hypothermia and
hypotension and continuing encephalopathy. Intially treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed sepsis, but no organisms
were ever identified. TSH and fT4 were WNL. Failed cortisol
stimulation test, so received stress dose steroids with no
change in BPs. BCx, UCx, and peritoneal fluids were not
consistent with infection. Improved on antibiotics (daptomycin,
meropenem, and ciprofloxacin). Discontinued Abx after 10 days.
Weaned off pressors without issue. However, developed oliguric
renal failure unresponsive to fluids, albumin, and mitodrine.
Diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome, and started on HD.
Initially had a groin line which bled due to his coagulopathy of
liver disease. Transfused PLT, FFP, and cryop
