ECG [**2174-4-18**]:
Sinus rhythm. Possible left atrial abnormality. Lateral ST-T
wave
abnormality. Cannot rule out myocardial ischemia. Poor R wave
progression.  Cannot rule out anterior wall myocardial
infarction of indeterminate age. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2174-4-2**] multiple described abnormalities persist.

CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**2174-4-18**]:
FINDINGS: There is a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion,
smaller in
size compared to last CT torso. There is a small pericardial
effusion. Study is suboptimal for evaluation of solid organs due
to lack of IV contrast. With this limitation in mind, there is
no extra- or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. Previously
described presumably focal nodular hyperplasia in segment VI of
the liver is not clearly visualized on a non-contrast CT. There
is a presumably gallbladder wall edema from third spacing with
moderate amount of ascites. There is likely gallbladder sludge.
Pancreas and bilateral adrenal glands are within normal limits
considering the limitation of no contrast administration. There
is interval increase in size of a fat-containing umbilical
hernia measuring 2 cm in transverse dimension with mild fat
stranding(2:50), correlate with point tenderness/physical exam.
The appendix is not dilated (2:49), contains air and there is a
likely small appendicolith (2:53). There is no bowel
obstruction. There is no evidence of colonic wall thickening,
although evaluation is suboptimal given lack of IV or PO
contrast and adjacent ascites.. The kidneys are normal in size.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Due to lack of oral
contrast, evaluation for mesenteric lymph nodes is suboptimal.
There are scattered lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, however,
do not meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.

CT PELVIS: There is free fluid in the pelvis - ascites. The
uterus and urinary bladder appear normal. The rectum and sigmoid
have scattered diverticula; however, no evidence of
diverticulitis.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion.
There is soft tissue stranding suggesting anasarca.

IMPRESSION:
1. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion; however, interval
decrease in size compared to prior.
2. Moderate ascites with interval increase.
3. No drainable fluid collection, however, evaluation is
suboptimal due to lack of IV and oral contrast.
4.
