Conclusions
Prebypass
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve is abnormal. There are two moderate-sized
vegetations on the aortic valve. Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is no evidence of aortic root
abscess or any aortic to RA/RV fistula.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is a
large vegetation on the mitral valve anterior leaflet and
appears perforated. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname **]
before bypass.

Postbypass:
Patient is on epinehrine 0.04mcg/kg/min, norepinephrine 0.1
mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 4units/hour.
His RV systolic function appears normal at the time of chest
closure.
LVEF 50% .
The mechanical prostheses at the mitral and aortic position are
in situ, stable and functioning well with acceptable resting
gradients (means at 10mm of Hg) and classic washing jets. Intact
thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 45-year-old patient with a known history of drug abuse
presented with bacterial
endocarditis involving both the aortic and mitral valves.  He
was transferred from an outside hospital, and a transesophageal
echo confirmed severe regurgitation with a
destroyed aortic valve leaflet with multiple vegetations and
vegetation on the mitral valve anterior leaflet with further
destruction and mitral regurgitation.  There was no clear-cut
abscess or any fistula seen from the aortic root to other
cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**].  He was initially managed with IV antibiotics,
but given his severe destruction of both the aortic and mitral
valve leaflets, he was taken to the
operating room on an urgent basis for aortic and mitral valve
replacements and possible homograft placement if there was any
abscess in the aortic root. Peoperatively, multiple discussions
were had with the patient and the family,
emphasizing the need for complete abstinence from drugs after
surgery, and the patient and the family were very focused on him
staying away from drugs. Preoperatively, he also had a coronary
angiogram with injection of only the left coronary artery which
was disease-free.  The right coronary artery was not injected
given the presence of a large vegetation at the right coronary
leaflet, close to the right coronary ostium.  The bacteria
involved was Strep viridans.  He also had a left arm abscess
which grew MRSA.  After about 10 days of antibiotic
treatment, he was taken to the operating room on [**2122-1-30**] where
the patient underwent aortic valve replacement with a size 23-mm
St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent mechanical valve and Mitral valve replacement
with a size 29 St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve. Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  He
was started on Coumadin for double mechanical valves and Heparin
drip was also started on post operative day 3 unitl INR was
greater than 2.5. The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication. The infectious disease team
was following closely.  He was continued on Gentamycin and
Ceftriaxone with end dates as noted. Right upper quandrant US
was performed [**2-4**] to rule out choleystasis while on Ceftriaxone
and this was unchanged from previous US with no acute process
seen. All other liver function tests were improving at the time
of discharge. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  His PICC
line was pulled [**2-2**] due to being in preoperatively while he was
infected and was replaced by IR on [**2-4**] for long term
antibiotics.  By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing well and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital1 **] Hopsital in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions including appointments and lab draws.
