Service:  [**Company 191**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female
with a distant history of deep venous thrombosis who is
admitted with fever and increased white blood cell count ?
and rule out sepsis who was enrolled in the sepsis protocol
in the Emergency Department.  The patient reports that for
the past week she has not been feeling well, though it is
difficult for her to specify.  Notes decreased po intake,
appetite, positive rhinorrhea and positive sneezing.  She
took her temperature today and it was 102.8.  She went to her
primary care physician who told her to come to the Emergency
Department.  She denies headaches, sore throat, cough,
shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
melena or hematochezia.  She does not burning with urination
for about three days with an increase in urinary frequency,
but no hematuria and no rash.  She denies any sick contacts.
She did have the flu vaccine in [**Month (only) 359**].  In the Emergency
Department her temperature was noted to be 102.0.  Her blood
pressure initially 133/61, oxygen saturation 92% on room air
with a heart rate of 114.  She was noted to have a white
blood cell count of 20,000 and a lactate of 4.1 on a venous
sample.  She was therefore enrolled in the sepsis protocol.
She was started on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.  She
received normal saline unclear volume.  She was admitted to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diverticulitis.
2.  Recurrent deep venous thrombosis.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hip fracture in [**2101**].
5.  Anxiety.
6.  Depression.
7.  Appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 25 mg once a day.
2.  Elavil 25 mg once a day.
3.  Triavil 2.25 once a day.
4.  Coumadin 2.25 five days a week and 3.75 two days a week.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa she gets a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married for over 50 years.
She lives with her husband and is legally blind.  She is
relatively independent in her activities of daily living.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.5.  Heart
rate 92.  Blood pressure 114/46.  Respiratory rate 18.
Oxygen saturation 98% on 2 liters.  HEENT normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck supple with a right
IJ in place after the sepsis protocol.  Pulmonary no
wheezing, left sided rales.  Cardiac S1 and S2 were normal.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen normoactive bowel
sounds, soft, seems distended with diffuse mild tenderness.
Extremities 1+ pitting edema in the left lower extremity.
Neurological alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves
II through XII intact.  No focal weakness.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 20.3,
platelets 600, hematocrit 29.5, INR was noted to be 3.5.  She
had 92% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes, sodium 139, potassium
5.5, chloride 102, bicarb 22, BUN 20, creatinine 0.6, glucose
160.  Liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes were
normal.  Troponin was less then .01.  Lactate went from 4 to
1.6.  Initially blood cultures were no growth.  Urine culture
was no growth.  Chest x-ray showed left basilar linear
atelectasis with no infiltrate or consolidation.
Electrocardiogram was sinus with a rate of approximately 100
and intraventricular conduction defect, left anterior
hemiblock, T wave inversions in V2 and V3, which is different
from an electrocardiogram of [**2104-11-28**], normal axis at a
rate of 70 and no T wave inversions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Fever:  A clear source of her fever had
not been identified at this point.  Repeated chest x-rays
were negative for infiltrate continually showing simply left
basilar atelectasis.  Blood cultures were no growth.  Urine
cultures times two were no growth.  The patient was initially
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on a sepsis protocol and received
aggressive intravenous fluids, antibiotics and had a right IJ
placed.  She did well rapidly and she was then transferred to
the floor for further management.  On the day of this
dictation the patient had developed some wheezing on her lung
examination, however, she did not complaint of shortness of
breath and she was maintaining her saturations at 94% on room
air.  Please note the patient was also ruled out for
influenza on this admission.

2.  Rule out myocardial infarction:  The patient had new T
wave inversions in V1 through V3 on electrocardiogram.  Her
cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative for ischemic
damage.  She was started on aspirin in the Intensive Care
Unit.  Her electrocardiograms were followed.  She was felt to
be in sinus rhythm, though tachycardic for much of the time.
However, at this point in her admission her Atenolol had been
held to explain her tachycardia along with continued volume
depletion.

3.  Gastrointestinal/anemia:  The patient was found to be
guaiac positive and her hematocrit decreased from 29 to 23.
This may have been due to volume repletion, however, she did
have a supratherapeutic INR of 3.5 on admission.  Her
Coumadin was held as it was only being given for deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis.  She did receive at least one unit of
packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in her
hematocrit.  GI was consulted to see the patient and there
impression was that she would benefit from a diagnostic
colonoscopy and upper endoscopy to evaluate this occult
gastrointestinal bleeding and to rule out a gastrointestinal
malignancy.  At this time these procedures were planned for
later today.

4.  History of deep venous thrombosis:  The patient has a
distant history of deep venous thrombosis in the [**2043**] and
again in the [**2073**] and she has been on anticoagulation ever
since.  As an outpatient the decision to continue
anticoagulating her should be reevaluated.

This concludes her discharge summary for hospital course from
[**2108-1-10**] to [**2108-1-13**].  The remainder of her hospital course
along with discharge disposition, instructions, medications,
diagnoses and condition will be addended in a later discharge
summary.
