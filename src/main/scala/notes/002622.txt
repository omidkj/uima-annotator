History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 16528**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of
afib on coumadin, metastatic GE junction adenocarcinoma, and
dCHF who presents with supratherapeutic INR and anemia. The
patient had been on coumadin for years and this was
discontinued, but subsequently restarted ([**10/2188**]) in the
setting of worsening PVD with arterial cloth in the setting of
metastatic esophageal cancer. She usually gets her INR checked
every 2 weeks but almost a month passed between her last INR
check and the one she had today. Her coumadin dose has remained
relatively stable, however, she has had increased constipation
and decreased appetite and PO intake over the past month. Her
INR check today was > 10 and her PCP advised [**Name9 (PRE) **] evaluation. Over
the past week Mrs. [**Known lastname 16528**] has had darker colored stools,
but has not had any hemetemesis, hematuria, BRBPR, or chest
pain. She has had one episode of epistaxis from her left nostril
and dry heaves for several days.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: Pain 0, T 97.8, HR 97, BP 111/49, RR
18, O2 sat 96% RA. On exam, patient was noted to be guaiac
positive with brown stool. Her labs were notable for an INR > 20
and Hct 22.8, approximately 10 points lower than her recent
baseline. She was given vitamin K 10 mg IV, FFP x 2, and
pantoprazole IV. Blood was also ordered. GI was called and
advised against NGT placement given recent epistaxis. They will
see the patient in the morning.

On arrival to the ICU, the patient was comfortable without any
chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH of afib on coumadin,
metastatic GE junction cancer, and dCHF who presented with an
INR > 20 and anemia with hematocrit 22.8, markedly decreased
from prior.

# Acute blood loss anemia: Patient with a Hct of 22.8 on
admission and dark guaiac positive stool in the setting of an
INR of 20. She had no evidence of brisk bleeding and remained
hemodynamically stable during her ICU stay. She received 2u of
pRBC's in the ICU with a Hct of 29.3 on discharge. She was
placed on an IV PPI q12H and was monitored on telemetry
throughout her course without incident.

# Supratherapeutic INR: Patient with an INR >20 on admission.
She received vitamin K 10 mg IV and 2 units FFP in the ED. Her
INR was reversed to 1.4 following these measures. Her PCP
recommended that the patient not restart it as an outpatient.

# EKG changes: Patient admitted with new TWI and ST depressions
on EKG without chest pain, though to be from demand ichemia in
the setting of anemia. CE's were negative x 2. A repeat EKG was
improved.

# Acute renal failure: Patient with an admission creatinine of
1.2 up from baseline of 0.6 - 0.9, likely secondary to
hypovolemia from anemia and poor PO intake from cancer. After
fluid repletion with blood products, her Cr dropped to 0.8. Her
Lasix was held in the ICU, but restarted prior to discharge.

# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient remained rate-controlled with
home dose of Metoprolol. Her ASA was held due to blood loss and
her physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 5263**], was consulted who recommended
stopping her Coumadin permanently.

#. Chronic Diastolic CHF: This was not an active issue during
her stay. She remained stable, but volume status was observed
carefully to prevent fluid overload in the context of receiving
blood products and holding home Lasix. Her ASA was held, but
restarted at 81mg prior to discharge, her Metoprolol was
continued, and her Lasix was restarted prior to discharge.
.
#. Hypothyroidism: TSH was normal and she was continued on her
home dose of levothyroxine.

#. Glaucoma: Home Lumigan was substituted for Latanoprost in
house.

#. Depression: Continued home Sertraline and started patient on
mirtazapine 15mg at bedtime to facilitate sleep and stimulate PO
intake.

#. Chronic post-nasal drip: Patient uses a Rhinocort nasal spray
at home that was substituted with fluticasone.  She was also
continued on her home Hyoscamine.
.
Code: Patient remained DNR/DNI throughout this hospitalization.
