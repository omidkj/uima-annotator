ADMISSION HISTORY AND PHYSICAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname 101686**] is a
45-year-old woman who has had metastatic breast cancer
notably to the lung, bone, brain, endometrium, and the liver
who was recently diagnosed with pelvic disease in [**2186-1-9**], after a biopsy secondary to vaginal bleeding.  She has
been on Xeloda since [**92**]/[**2185**].  She presented with persistent
complaints for approximately 2 weeks of feeling bloated and
obstipated with some crampy abdominal pain.  She had also had
some bilious nausea and vomiting.  As her symptoms worsened,
she sought medical attention several times, and finally was
evaluated in the ED for an acute change in the pain.

INITIAL EXAMINATION:  99.3, pulse 81, blood pressure 115/66,
respiratory rate 12, satting 98% on room air.  She did not
appear to be in any distress.  She was not jaundice, and her
sclerae were anicteric.  She did not have any palpable
cervical adenopathy.  Her lungs were clear.  Heart was
regular.  Abdomen was distended.  It was tense.  It was
notably tender on the right to percussion with some guarding.
Rectal exam did not have any stool in the vault, but
otherwise no masses palpable.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 7.1, hematocrit 31.3.  BUN and
creatinine were 20 and 1.3 with a K of 3.0 notably.  LFTs -
ALT and AST 8 and 30, alk phos 80, total bili 0.5.  Calcium
8.5.  The patient had a CT of the abdomen in order to further
assess the etiology of the obstruction and was found to have
distal large bowel obstruction from pelvic metastases with
secondary ischemic infarction of the ascending colon, as per
pneumatosis coli.  She also had some right-sided
hydronephrosis and hydroureter from the distal obstruction,
and several metastatic liver lesions were noted.  There were
sclerotic metastases to the bone present.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and after
extensive discussion with the hematology and oncology
services, it was felt that the patient was in need of an
exploratory laparotomy and likely colectomy in order for
relief of this obstruction.  Therefore, the patient was taken
to the operating room on [**2186-4-8**] and underwent a
total abdominal colectomy with end-ileostomy, sigmoid colon
mucous fistula, and omentectomy.  There was no note of
intraoperative complication or excessive blood loss.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  She remained intubated
and spent the night in the Intensive Care Unit for
respiratory support and management of fluid status.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was extubated without
note of difficulty.  Her hematocrit was otherwise stable.
She was, therefore, transferred to the floor by postoperative
day #2.  On postoperative day #2, the patient was notably
somewhat tachycardic, actually since postoperative day #1,
with pulse ranging between 100 and the high-120s.  This was
evaluated, and as the patient's hematocrit was stable, and
she was maintaining good O2 sats, it was felt this was
secondary to a combination of dehydration and pain.
Therefore, she was aggressively rehydrated with lactated
Ringer's, and pain control was achieved postoperatively with
the use of PCA.

By postoperative day #3, it was apparent that the patient's
pain was a combination of acute and chronic pain.  It was
felt that the pain management service should be involved and;
therefore, they were consulted to manage the patient's acute
on chronic pain.  In terms of their recommendations, they
suggested getting her back to her oral medications as fast as
possible, but in the meanwhile that methadone PCA would be
the best choice for her.  She was started on this.  She did
not really respond to the methadone PCA and required some
dilaudid intermittently, but by postoperative day #4, she was
showing evidence of bowel activity and, therefore, was
started on her PO pain medications along with some additional
Vioxx which actually did control her pain.

Otherwise, the patient's postoperative course was relatively
uneventful.  Her tachycardia resolved, although she did
remain with the pulse between 80s-90s by the time of her
discharge.  She always maintained stable pressures, and only
had a low-grade temp of 101.6 which was thought to be
secondary to atelectasis.  We did want to schedule an MRI as
an inpatient to evaluate for the extent for bony metastatic
disease, as there may have been some possible way to
intervene if it was, in fact, spinal in origin, but the
patient said she was not comfortable with sitting through an
MRI during the hospitalization and; therefore, it was felt
that this could be done as an outpatient as per her wishes.

Otherwise, it was noted that the patient did well.  She was
given physical therapy, and given instructions regarding a
stoma.  It was felt that by postoperative day #6, this
patient was on a regular diet which she was tolerating
without any difficulty, and that she had excellent pain
control with PO medications, and was ambulating to the best
of her ability, that she could be discharged to home in fair
condition.  The acute pain management service recommendations
were followed up for her pain.  Otherwise, at the time of
discharge the patient's hematocrit was 27.3.  Her BUN and
creatinine had improved to 13 and 1.0, and her K was 3.6.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Methadone 15 mg po bid.
2. Oxycodone 5 mg po q 4-6 h prn pain.
3. Vioxx 50 mg po qd.
She was told she could resume her home medications which
included:
4. Xeloda 1 [**Hospital1 **].
5. Lasix prn.
6. Ambien 10 mg po qd.
7. Coreg 12.5 mg po qd.
8. Levoxyl 50 mcg po qd.
9. Mavik 1 mg po qd.
She was advised that she should follow-up with her primary
care physician for any adjustments in these medications.
