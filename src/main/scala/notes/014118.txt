Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7539**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath
CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 80 yo male with no known significant CAD but
history of HTN, CKD, COPD, restrictive lung disease by PFTs,
severe emphysema radiographically, hx of active TB (treated in
[**2154**]), and diastolic dysfunction documented on previous
echocardiogram who presents with 4 day history of increasing
dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, and PND. Patient was
recently an inpatient at [**Hospital1 18**] for left iliac artery aneurysm
coiling. This hospital course was complicated by respiratory
arrest and hypotension of unclear etiology, although per [**Name (NI) **]
thought to be likely secondary to hypercarbic resp failure
(although no ABGs demonstrate this). In the setting of this
event the patient developed a RBBB which resolved over a short
interval. Cardiology was consulted with reported recs of ASA,
statin, Beta blocker and heparin drip. Per the patient's report,
after discharge from the hospital his respiratory symptoms were
relatively improved from his baseline, although he had developed
bilateral lower extremity edema which was new. This past friday,
the patient was seen by a VNA nurse who heard crackles on lung
exam and doubled his home lasix from 20mg PO qd to 40mg PO.
Despite this intervention, the following day the patient
developed symptoms of PND. Over the course of a few days the
patient has been having worsening respiratory symptoms,
ultimately necessitating a visit to the E.D. today. He denies
any recent URI symptoms, chest pain, diaphoresis, N/V,
increasing sputum production, or F/C. The patient reports he has
been compliant with his medications and denies any significant
change in his diet.
.
In the ED the patient was assessed and thought to be in
decompensated CHF. The patient was given 80mg Lasix x1, 40mg x 1
and nitro gtt for BP control. The patient was placed on BIPAP
([**9-15**]), 50% Fi02. The patient diuresed 1800cc in 12 hours in the
ED. The patient was temporarily weaned from BIPAP but had
subsequent desat to low 80's, requiring replacement of mask. CCU
transfer was requested by ED attending at this point.

[**2168-1-12**]: Portable Chest: Advanced CHF with pulmonary edema
pattern. These findings existed already on the previous
examinations, [**12-18**] and [**2167-12-15**].
.
[**2168-1-13**]: Echocardiogram:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is
mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Left ventricular
dysnchrony is present.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is
mildly dilated.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8.The main pulmonary artery is dilated.
9.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**2168-1-14**]: Portable Chest - Chest CT and radiographs in [**Month (only) **]
[**2166**] showed severe emphysema, and probable mild interstitial
lung disease with surprisingly low lung volumes. Interstitial
abnormality was more pronounced on [**12-18**] and had progressed
by [**1-12**], may indicate pulmonary edema or progression of
interstitial lung disease.  Slight improvement since [**1-12**] suggests at least a component of pulmonary edema.  Heart is
normal size.  No appreciable pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 80 year old male with PMHx significant for HTN,
CKD, COPD, interstitial lung disease, TB infection s/p
treatment, and diastolic dysfunction who presents to ED with 3
to 4 days of worsening respiratory symptoms and CHF
exacerbation.

Cardiology
#. PUMP: The patient presented to the ED with evidence of
decompensated CHF given pulmonary exam with crackles and
significant peripheral edema. However, the patient additionally
has a history of significant pulmonary disease including severe
emphysema as well as interstitial restrictive disease, making
the patient's hypoxia and respiratory symptoms likely
multifactorial. The patient had a prior echo in [**2167-10-13**]
which demonstrated preserved systolic function, EF > 55%, but
evidence of impaired ventricular relaxation. There was no clear
precipitant for the patient's decompensation on admission,
although he has had prior admissions for uncontrolled
hypertension. He ruled out for an acute ischemic event x 3 and
denied any medical non-compliance or change in his diet. On
admission he was placed on a nitro
