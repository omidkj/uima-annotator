Imaging:
Echo [**1-14**]: IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of
endocarditis. Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Trace aortic and mitral regurgitation.
.
R knee xray [**1-12**]: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or dislocation.
No evidence of hardware failure.
.
CXR [**1-13**] FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there
is a newly appeared minimal right-sided pleural effusion.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged, including the
pre-existing interstitial markings and the partial atelectasis
of the middle lobe. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No
newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

.
CT chest without contrast [**1-16**]:
The heart is normal in size, with aortic valvular and mitral
annular calcifications noted. There is no pericardial effusion.
An aneurysm of the
ascending aorta measures 4.5 cm x 4.4 cm, previously measured
4.4 cm x 4.4 cm at a comparable level.
.
Central lymphadenopathy has increased, and is likely reactive. A
right upper paratracheal lymph node (2:18) measures 16 mm x 10
mm, previously measured 6 mm x 9 mm. A right paratracheal lymph
node measures 14 mm wide, previously 9 mm. A subcarinal node
measures 12 mm, previously 8 mm.
.
Widespread bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening, most
notable within the upper lobes and lingula, are associated with
numerous bronchiolar nodules and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, which
are increased within the right lower lobe compared to the prior
study. There is also a new confluent opacification in the right
lower lobe (4:157-174). These findings progression of atypical
mycobacterial infection.
.
Chronic collapse of the right middle lobe is stable in
appearance. Mucoid
impaction within dilated bronchioles are notable within the
lingula.
.
A small non-hemorrhagic layering right pleural effusion is new.

.
This examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic
evaluation. The liver is diffusely low in attenuation,
compatible with fatty infiltration.
.
Osseous structures reveal no suspicious abnormality with
multilevel
degenerative changes of the spine seen.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of diffuse airways disease, with a new
confluent area of opacification in the right lower lobe. The
findings are suggestive of atypical mycobacterial infection.
2. New small right pleural effusion.
3. Central lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.
4. Stable collapse of the right middle lobe.
5. Stable aneurysm of the ascending aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
74 year old woman s/p R total knee replacement in [**1-17**] with R
knee liner exchange and wash out on [**2164-12-3**], with
intra-operative cultures growing Streptococcus virdians on
ceftriaxone who presented to the MICU with fever and
hypotension.
.
#. Presumed sepsis: Patient presented with hypotension to 70's
systolic in ED, improved to mid 80's to 90's systolic, MAPs 60's
following 4.5 liters IVF.  Pt was admitted to the MICU out of
concern for sepsis, however pressors were not required.  Highest
on differential included evolving sepsis due to combination of
fever, elevated WBC to 13, tachycardia, tachypnea (meeting
criteria for SIRS) plus suspected source of infection as PNA.
Patient was evaluated by the orthopedic team, who felt that her
R knee was a less likely source of recurrent infection. PICC
line was removed. The patient was started on Vancomycin and
Cefepime for HCAP, and levaquin for double coverage of
pseudomonas. Blood cultures were pending at the time of transfer
to the floor. Urine cultures were negative. ID consultation was
sought given the persistence of fever in the ICU.  After her BPs
stabilized, she was called out to the medicine floor.
.
On the floor, the patient was noted to be normotensive
throughout her stay on the floor.  All of her Cxs returned
negative (Blood, Urine, Sputum, catheter tip of PICC).  As per
ID c/s, a CT chest was done which was concerning for progression
of [**Doctor First Name **], however pt's pulmonologi
