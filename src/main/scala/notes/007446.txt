Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2195-2-17**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5322**] for a revision right total hip arthroplasty. Please see
operative report for details. The surgery was uncomplicated and
the patient tolerated the procedure well. She received two units
of PRBC intraoperatively. Postoperatively she had some
hypotension and was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.
She was transferred out of the ICU the following morning in
stable condition. Peri-operative vancomycin and Lovenox for DVT
prophylaxis were given as per routine. Pain was controlled
initially with a PCA and then transitioned to oral pain meds on
POD#1. The patient was transfused several units of PRBC
postoperatively for postoperative blood loss anemia; her HCT on
[**2-21**] was 31.9. The Foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient
was voiding independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage.

The patient was seen by the Infectious Disease service who felt
the perioperative Vanco was adequate coverage. She was started
on Bactrim DS for 6 weeks as prophylaxis against infection given
her history of MRSA and the presence of a relatively large
cadaveric allograft in the operative site per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5322**]. In
addition, she was also seen by Ophthalmology for transient
blurry vision. Her eye exam was normal and her blurry vision
resolved spontaneously.

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by Physical
therapy. She was fitted for an abduction brace and assisted with
mobilization. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course
and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge she was
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well. She was afebrile
with stable vital signs. Her hematocrit was acceptable and her
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign.
She progressed well with Physical Therapy. Post-operative Xrays
demonstrated hardware in good position. She was discharged in
stable condition. Her weight-bearing status is touchdown weight
bearing on the right lower extremity with posterior hip
precautions and trochanter off precautions.

She was discharged to home with services and instructions for
follow up were provided.
