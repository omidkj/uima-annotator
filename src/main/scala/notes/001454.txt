Head CT: Bilateral subdural hematomas, right greater than left.
Large amounts of subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Hemorrhagic
contusions in the right frontal and temporal lobes.  Effacement
of the perimesencephalic cisterns and right uncal herniation.
Mild amounts of cerebral edema are present.  There are
nondisplaced fractures through the left occipital bone and the
left temporal bone, extending down to the anterior middle
cranial fossa.  Nasal bone and orbital floor fractures.

CT spine: No fractures or dislocations of the cervical spine.
Temporal bone fracture and subarachnoid and subdural blood
present within the brain. Please see the head CT for discussion
of the report.

CT pelvis w/contrast: There is linear high attenuation material
around the ascending aorta most consistent with prior aortic
arch stent graft repair.  There is a focal 8 x 6 mm outpouching
in the mid ascending aorta of uncertain chronicity.  There is no
definite evidence of acute contrast extravasation.  There also
appear to be clips in the aortic arch, likely related to the
aortic graft repair.
1.  Patient appears to be status post graft repair of ascending
aorta/aortic arch.  There is an 8 x 6 mm ascending aortic wall
outpouching of uncertain age.  Most likely, however, this
represent a chronic finding.  There is no definite evidence of
periaortic hematoma.  Results discussed with the trauma team and
a _____ will be performed while the patient undergoes
craniotomy.
2.  No acute injuries to solid organs hollow organs, vascular
structures, or bony structures.
3.  Moderate bilateral dependent atelectasis.

L-spine CT: No acute fractures or acute dislocations

T-spine CT:  No fractures or dislocations of the thoracic spine.
 No malalignment.  No obvious central canal compromise

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 57 year old man status post motorcycle
accident, helmet off with R frontal-temporal contusion and
bilateral SDH taken emergently for R frontal craniotomy on [**7-3**].
Bolt was placed and intracranial pressures were monitored
closely. Patient was continued on mannitol and hyperventilated
with goal PCO2 30-35. Transducer was replaced on [**7-8**] and ICP
normalized. Trach and PEG were placed. Patient spiked a
temperature of 102 and grew enterobacter (cipro sensitive) and H
flu from sputum. Patient was initially started on Zosyn and
switched to Ciprofloxacin and completed a 7 day course for
empiric treatment of pneumonia. Bolt was removed on [**7-10**] and
staples were removed on [**7-13**]. Patient was weaned to trach mask
and CT spine was cleared by ICU team. At time of discharge,
patient was opening eyes to voice, moving all extremities and
wiggling toes to command. Plan for patient to go to rehab. Goal
to wean ativan with slow taper and to follow-up in [**Hospital 4695**]
clinic to clear c-spine when mental status improved. CT spine
negative for fxs. Keep hard c collar on until follow-up with
Neurosurgery.
