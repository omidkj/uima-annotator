Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated [**2142-10-19**]

History of Present Illness:
85 yo female with past medical history of emphysema and dementia
was transferred from the floor with altered mental status and
hypercarbia.

The patient initially presented to the ED with altered mental
status and lethargy. Upon arrival to the ED, temp 96.9, HR 60,
BP 200/110, RR 15, and Pulse ox 100% on 3L with her exam notable
for being alert but not oriented. Initial CXR was notable for
stable cardiomegaly only and her head CT did not demonstrate any
new changes. She received ceftriaxone and vancomycin to cover
for meningitis. Initial labs were notable for a normal WBC at
6.8. She was then admitted to the medical floor where she was
noted to be somnolent and an ABG demonstrated pH 7.19, PCO2 90,
and PO2 92. She was then transferred to the MICU.

Further history was obtained from her family and OMR as patient
could not cooperate with history. According to her
granddaughters, at baseline when she is in familiar
surroundings, she speaks, is able to perform her ADLs with
assistance, and ambulates with a walker. She is less interactive
with strangers. Over the three days prior to admission, her
family noted that she was increasingly lethargic, difficult to
arouse, and less interactive. She was then brought in by her
family for altered mental status. According to her family, ROS
was notable for possible increased urinary urgency, increased
work of breath, abdominal pain, and poor sleeping for 3 days
prior to admission. Her family otherwise denies fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, chest pain, cough, diarrhea, or constipation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2142-10-19**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. Massive but
stable cardiomegaly. There is underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension as identified on [**2141-4-11**] chest CT.

[**2142-10-19**] CT head without contrast: wet read: no evidence of acute
ich. likely meningiomas again seen, not signficantly changed
from prior.



Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo F with CHF, T2DM, COPD, and dementia admitted with altered
mental status found to have profound hypercarbia and worsened
cardiac function on echo.  The patient was maintained on BiPAP
to improve her hypercarbia, and her mental status improved.  The
patient and her family decided to be DNR/DNI and to go home with
hospice care.  Social work and palliative care met with the
patient and family and arranged for services.

# Acute on chronic respiratory failure. Significant
hypercarbia/respiratory acidosis. Likely etiology is
intercurrent MI or ischemic insult to the heart resulting in
worsened CHF as evidenced by TTE with progression of cardiac
dysfunction.  She was aggressively diuresed, and responded well
to lasix 80mg IV. Patient family decided on [**2142-10-21**] that patient
was DNR/DNI and wanted to take the patient home with hospice
care.  Her respiratory status was stable at the time of
discharge.

# Altered mental status. Likely secondary to
hypercardia/respiratory acidosis. Her mental status improved
over her 5 days in the ICU.  She was maintained on BiPAP to
improve her ventilation.

# Congestive heart failure. Progressive failure on echo with
clinical signs of fluid overloaded.
- Diurese. Monitor electrolytes twice daily while diuresing.
- Consider restarting beta blocker. To consider starting low
dose ACEi as tolerated if CRI stable.

# Elevated LFTs. Likely secondary to congestion in the setting
of worsening CHF.  Her LFT's improved throughout her hospital
course.

# Hypernatremia. She was thought to be free water deplete.  We
replace her free water based on her free water deficit with D5W.
