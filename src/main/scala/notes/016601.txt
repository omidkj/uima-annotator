CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval pleural effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old man s/p ERCP
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval pleural effusion
CHEST PORTABLE.

INDICATION: 56-year-old man status post ERCP, evaluate pleural
effusion.

CHEST PORTABLE: No prior studies are available for comparison.
There is a large pleural effusion on the right, which surrounds
the entire right lung and extends into the apex. The left lung
is not completely depicted on this film; however, depicted
aspects are unremarkable. There is a central venous line seen
with its tip in the mid SVC.

IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: Assess for vascular malformations
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
56 year old man with chronic pancreatitis, possible
pancreatico-pulmonary fistula, possible av fistulae
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess for vascular malformations
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS

There is no comparison exam.

CLINICAL HISTORY: Chronic pancreatitis, possible pancreatic or
pulmonary fistula, possible AV fistula. Assess for vascular
malformation.

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis obtained
after pre and post-IV contrast enhancement. Multiplanar volume
reformatted images were generated, which were essential in the
evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis.

CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Images of the lower thorax demonstrate a
small right pleural effusion and a chest tube. There is
consolidation/atelectasis at the right lower lobe. There is a
small pneumothorax on the right. Small left pleural effusion is
also present.

Pre-contrast images of the abdomen demonstrate multiple small
calcifications in the pancreas consistent with chronic
pancreatitis. There is atherosclerosis.

Post-contrast images demonstrate a normal appearance of the
liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys. The pancreas is
atrophic. The pancreatic duct is dilated. Numerous cystic
structures are present adjacent to the pancreas. The largest is
adjacent to pancreatic tail and extends between the stomach and
spleen and measures 3.5 x 4.1 cm. Another large bilobed cyst is
seen extending from the lesser sac to the pancreatic head. It
contains a focus of gas.

There is a small fluid collection in the right diaphragmatic
crus measuring less than 4 mm wide. This is best seen on series
6, image 22.

There are no dilated bowel loops. There are scattered prominent
lymph nodes.

CT PELVIS FINDINGS: There is no pelvic free fluid or
lymphadenopathy. No dilated bowel loops are present within the
pelvis. Gas is seen in the urinary bladder.

Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic lesions.

CTA FINDINGS: There is conventional hepatic vasculature. The
celiac axis, common hepatic artery, left gastric artery, and
splenic artery are patent. There is no splenic artery aneurysm.
There is atherosclerosis at the origin of the SMA causing a
high-grade stenosis but the distal SMA is patent. The renal
arteries are patent. There is narrowing of the splenic vein
likely second to pancreatitis. There is a filling defect in the
inferior mesenteric vein consistent with thrombus.

There is conventional portal venous anatomy. The hepatic venous
anatomy is normal. There is no evidence of a fistula either
within the abdomen or between the thorax and abdomen.

IMPRESSION:
1. No AV fistula or pancreatic or pulmonary fistula as
questioned.
2. Numerous cystic structures surrounding the pancreas
consistent with pancreati
