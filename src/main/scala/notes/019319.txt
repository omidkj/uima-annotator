Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, tachycardia, respiratory secretion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
66 yo F with history of traumatic brain injury with left
hemiplegia, s/p meningioma resection with residual speech/motor
deficits, presenting originally to ortho service following fall
from chair where she broke her left femur.  Medicine consult was
approached for management of sinus tachycardia.  Ortho had
thought tachycardia was secondary to pain.  She was also found
to have a lot of respiratory secretions at that time, but no
mention in charts prior to medicine involvement of secretions.
Patient had been saturating 89% on 2L, but once deep suctioned,
O2 saturation improved to 97% on 2L.  She required frequent deep
suctioning on the floor, about every 2 hours.  As the nasal
passage became more inflammed with each episode of suctioning,
the suction catheter was no longer able to be passed nasally by
respiratory therapy.  Patient unable to cough up secretions on
her own as she has a weak cough, nothing able to be suctioned
with the yankauer catheter.  As the night progressed, she had
more labored breathing, saturating 89-91% on 5 L NC, then
requiring 10 L on facemask to maintain saturation.  Transferred
to the MICU for worsening respiratory status.
.
On transfer to the ICU, patient is very fatigued, mental status
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]; usually able to answer questions but very
difficult to understand.  Breathing slightly labored on
facemask.
.
Review of systems:
Patient unable to answer review of system questions


Past Medical History:
-severe osteoporosis
-left hip fracture and repair [**4-27**] yrs ago
-Traumatic brain injury after fall [**4-27**] yrs ago / she fell
striking the right side of her head where cranial defect is
/resulting in left hemiplegia
- right sided meningioma resection 47 yrs ago Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12795**] at
[**Hospital1 2025**] / then second procedure to remove bone flap "because it was
calcified" per husband. She does not wear a helmet at home / she
never has.

Social History:
Lives at home with husband / has home aides to assist with
bathing / walks with a cane and or assistance of her husband/
cannot use a walker [**12-23**] left hand weakness according to husband.


Family History:
unknown

Physical Exam:
Gen: appears anxious, slightly fatigued, AAOx2, difficult to
understand speech, following simple commands
HEENT: +lateral nystagmus, limited gaze downward, OP clear
Neck: no JVD, no LAD
CV: S1S2, tachycardic, no m/r/g
Chest: CTAB in anterior fields, decreased BS at bases b/l
GI: soft, NT, ND, no HSM, +BS
Ext: no c/c/e, LLE rotated inwards
Neuro: left side weaker than right

Pertinent Results:
Femur XR -
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute comminuted distal femoral fracture, with varus
angulation and posterior displacement of the distal fracture
fragment by one-half shaft width.
2. Hardware fixation of old healed left intertrochanteric
fracture, with marked heterotopic ossification.
3. Left proximal tibial enchondroma.
.
CT T&L-spine
CONCLUSION:
- Severe loss of height associated with compression fractures at
T7 and T12 with kyphosis. Fracture of the superior endplate of
L2 without angulation. These fractures are of indeterminate age.

- Left lower lobe consolidation or atelectasis.
- Cystic lesions in both kidneys.
- Status post left femoral neck fracture repair.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo F with traumatic brain injury with left hemiplegia
transferred to the MICU with persistent sinus tachycardia and
worsening respiratory status in setting of femur fracture
sustained from a fall
.
# Respiratory distress - Patient with increasing O2 requirement,
has trouble clearing secretions.  Saturations had been improved
with deep suctioning.  She is unable to clear secretions on her
own given weak cough, possibly due to the high doses of
narcotics that she received on the floor.  Pt intubated at
admission to the MICU for respiratory distress.  Started on
antibiotics for presumed PNA.  During the course of her stay,
attempted extubation twice, however required reintubation for
tachycardia, agitation, and inability to protect airway.  After
discussion with the family, pt was made DNR/DNI, and the
decision was made to extubate on [**12-8**], with plans for no
re-intubation.  After extubation, pt became tachypneic and
distressed; morphine drip was started for comfort, and patient
passed away that afternoon.
.
# Sinus tachycardia - likely multifactorial.  Originally thought
to be due to pain, but was not been responsive to increased
doses of narcotic medication prior transfer to the ICU.  Pain
likely still plays a part in the sinus tachycardia.  Patient
appeared volume down, so hypovolemia may also have played a
role.  Tachycardia improved with fluids, better pain control,
and increase in metoprolol dose.
.
# h/o TBI - phenytoin was continued for the duration of
hospitalization.
.
# Femur fracture - pt had repair of femur fracture by
orthopedics on [**12-2**], which she tolerated well.
