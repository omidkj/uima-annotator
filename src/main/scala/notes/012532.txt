Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname 122**] [**Known lastname 60016**] is a 35 day old infant
born at 37 3/7 weeks gestation with a birthweight of 2.79
kilograms to a 34 year old G-2, P-1 now 2 woman.
Prenatal screens - Bloodtype O positive, antibody negative,
Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen
negative, group beta Strep status negative.

The pregnancy was remarkable for a prental diagnosis of
trisomy-21 and also determination of a complete atrioventricular
canal defect and right hydronephrosis.

The infant was born by vaginal delivery.  Apgar's were 8 at one
minute and 9 at five minutes.  He was admitted to the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for monitoring and evaluation.
Membranes were ruptured artificially one hour prior to
delivery.  There were no sepsis risk factors.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 2.79 kilograms - 50th
percentile, length 48 cm - 50th percentile, head
circumference 32 cm - 25th percentile.  General - Well
developed infant active with exam, no distress.  HEENT -
Facies consistent with trisomy-21, fontanelle soft and flat.
Ears and nares patent.  Palate intact.  Red reflex present
bilaterally.  Neck - Supple, mildly redundant nuchal folds.
Chest - Clear, no grunting, flaring or retracting.
Cardiovascular - Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.  Early
systolic click.  Normoactive precordium.  Femoral pulses 2
plus and symmetric.  Abdomen - Soft, no hepatosplenomegaly,
no masses, three vessel cord.  GU - Normal male, testes
palpable, anus patent.  Extremities - No lesions or edema.
Hips and back - Normal.  Skin - Warm, pink brisk capillary
refill, no rash.  Neurologic - Overall appropriate mildly reduced
tone and activity.  Moro, grasp and suck intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Respiratory.  [**Known lastname 122**] had no underlying respiratory
   disease.  He did require nasal cannula briefly once on day
   of life number two.  He does at times have mildly elevated
   respiratory rates which is felt to be consistent with
   symptoms of congestive heart failure due to his heart
   defect.  This improved significantly with initiation of
   digoxin and furosemide 3 weeks ago.  At the time of discharge
   he is breathing 50-80 times per minute.  He does have
   noticeable increased work of breathing with oral feeding.

2. Cardiovascular.  Post-natal echo's confirmed the complete
   atrioventricular canal defect and was felt to have a right
   dominance with a slightly small left ventricle.  There
   appeared at first to be a small hypoplastic arch.  This was
   followed closely until the PDA was closed.  The most recent
   echo was on [**2146-1-26**] which showed that the right dominant
   complete atrioventricular canal defect with a closed patent
   ductus arteriosus.
   There was a mildly hypoplastic transverse arch without
   significant obstruction by Doppler flow.  There was mild
   atrioventricular valve regurgitation and qualitatively
   good biventricular systolic function.  [**Known lastname 122**] has been
   started on Digoxin and Lasix to control his congestive
   heart failure.  He does have a significant audible murmur
   on exam.  No gallop has been noted. [**Known lastname 122**] is going to be
   followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38675**], Pediatric Cardiology at [**Hospital1 55707**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 53364**].  An appointment is
   scheduled for Friday, [**2146-2-25**] at 10:30 AM.

3. Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition.  Enteral feeds were
   started on the day of birth.  On day of life number two
   [**Known lastname 122**] was noted to have grossly bloody stools.  An
   abdominal x-ray at that time showed a very concerning
   bowel gas pattern.  He was made NPO and the diagnosis of
   necrotizing enterocolitis was made.  He was treated with
   bowel rest for 14 days in addition to triple antibiotics.
   He had a percutaneously inserted central venous catheter
   and received total parenteral nutrition.  Enteral feeds
   were restarted on day of life number 16 and gradually
   advanced to full volume.  His feedings have been well
   tolerated.  He has inconsistent oral feedings and still
   receives feedings by gavage too.  His current intake is
   140 cc/kg/day of the mother's breast milk fortified to 34
   calories per ounce, 10 calories by NeoSure powder and 4
   calories by corn oil.  His discharge weight is 2.98
   kilograms with a head circumference of 33 cm and a length
   of 52 cm.  [**Known lastname 122**] also receives potassium chloride
   supplements as part of therapy for his heart medications.

4. Infectious disease.  As previously noted, [**Known lastname 122**] was
   treated for necrotizing enterocolitis with 14 days of
   ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin.  Blood cultures
   were no growth.  He did not have any other systemic
   infections.  He is on prophylaxis for his hydronephrosis.
   He initially was being treated with amoxicillin but was
   noted to have developed an allergic drug rash that was
   treated with diphenhydramine and cessation of amoxicillin.
   He was changed to nitrofurantoin for prophylaxis on [**2146-2-18**].
   Dermatology was consulted, Attending Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38485**],
   felt the rash was most consistent with drug allergy.

5. Hematological.  Hematocrit at birth was 60 percent.  His
   most recent hematocrit was on [**2146-2-20**] at 44 percent with a
   reticulocyte count of 2.7 percent.  [**Known lastname 122**] did not receive
   any transfusions of blood products during admission.

6. Gastrointestinal.  As previously noted, [**Known lastname 122**] had
   necrotizing enterocolitis.  He also required treatment for
   unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.  His peak serum bilirubin
   occurred on day of life five, a total of 15.2/0.4 mg/dl
   direct.  He received phototherapy for approximately 72
   hours.  Rebound bilirubin was a total of 9.2/0.6 mg/dl
   direct.

7. Renal.  Post-natal ultrasounds confirmed the moderately
   severe right hydronephrosis.  Most likely diagnosis is right
   ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  A urology consult was
   obtained from Dr. [**Known lastname 122**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 45267**] from [**Hospital3 1810**].
   Also noted on the ultrasound was echogenic renal pelvices.
   A voiding cystourethrogram and repeat ultrasound were
   performed on [**2146-2-22**].  Results of the VCUG revealed a normal
   bladder and urethra with no reflux.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 45267**]
   is planned on Friday [**2146-2-25**]. Urinary prophylaxis was
   discontinued after a final dose after the VCUG on [**2146-2-22**].

8. Neurology.  [**Known lastname 122**] has maintained a normal neurological
   exam with mildly reduced tone and head control during
   admission.  His tone and reflexes are low normal
   consistent with his gestational age and normal within the
   setting of his known Trisomy 21.

9. Sensory.

Audiology - Screening with automated auditory brainstem responses
were performed and passed in both ears.  Because of his diagnosis
of Trisomy 21, further hearing evaluation with
full auditory brain stem responses is planned for after discharge
at [**Hospital3 1810**] in [**Location (un) 86**].

Psychosocial - The parents are very involved and enthusiastic
about taking on [**Known lastname 11042**] complex needs at home.  Mother is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN
and is extremely compentent in his care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  Home with the parents.  The primary care provider
is family practitioner, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**Street Address(2) 60017**], [**Location (un) 21892**], [**Numeric Identifier 60018**], phone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 48826**].

CARE AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Feeding.  PO or by gavage 140 cc/kl/day of breast milk
   fortified to 34 calories per ounce, 10 calories by NeoSure
   powder and 4 calories by corn oil.  The NeoSure powder is
   recommended unt
