Hypotension

Transesophageal [**First Name3 (LF) **]
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 51-year-old woman with SLE and severe PAH diagnosed
in [**2154-12-20**] with excellent response to Flolan, recently
admitted and discharged on day PTA for right heart cardiac cath
performed for progressive hypoxemia with increased need  for
supplemental oxygen despite an improved [**Year (4 digits) 461**] and
six-minute walk test distanceand renal biopsy for proteinuria,
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital with hypotension SBPs
60s-70s. Patient discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] [**11-10**], awoke this am
around noon with confusion, lethargy, dizziness with standing.
On arrival to [**Hospital3 **] ED BP 73/48,HR 103, RR18 95% 4L, T98.2.
Prior to transfer BP 85/53, 100% RA. Only OSH Lab Data WBC 4.2
HCT 30, PLT 133. CXR low lung volumes with no acute process. PIV
x 2 placed, received 4L NS and Linezolid x 1 and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] MICU.

Upon arrival pt's vitals 100.7 HR 106 BP 95/57 RR19 74-99% O2
sats. She reports she has had dizziness, low BPs and overall
malaise x 2-3 days. Also reports subjective fevers, no chills,
and tenderness at line site x 1 week but no purulent drainage or
erythema. She has had line x 1 year and reports prior h/o
similar presentations with line sepsis. Has minimal pain at left
flank site of biopsy, no pain in right groin where had cath.
Only other complaint is chronic headache and recurrence of
chronic bilateral shoulder pain x 2 days. Recent medictaion
changes include addition of Lisinopril 1 week prior and holding
of Coumadin for procedure (renal biopsy) planned to be restarted
[**11-13**]. Denies change in chronic dyspnea or LE edema, denies
cough, chest pain, LE  pain, dysuria, hematuria, melena,
hematochezia, numbness/weakness.

PFO)

Family History:
Her father died of colon cancer at age 73. Her mother is healthy
as are her brother and sisters.

Physical Exam:
Vitals - T 100.7 HR 106 BP 95/57 RR 19 O2sat 74-99%

NAD, speaking in full sentences. Cushingoid appearance
HEENT: Dry MM. NCAT. Sclera anicteric. EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
Neck: Thick. Unable to appreciate JVD.
CV: Tachy. Prominent split S2. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CXR:
Azygos distention reflects increased intravascular fluid volume.
Pulmonary circulation is borderline engorged but there is no
edema. Mild cardiomegaly stable. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Right subclavian line tip projects over the mid
SVC. No pneumothorax

Chest CT:
IMPRESSIONS:

1. Main pulmonary artery enlargement is little changed compared
to [**2154**], and
is consistent with the history of pulmonary hypertension.
Cardiac enlargement,
with prominence of the right ventricle, is unchanged.

2. No evidence of interstitial lung disease or other new
intrathoracic
process is seen to account for increasing oxygen requirement.

3. Small pericardial effusion may be related to the patient's
underlying
lupus.

4. Mild small airway obstruction.

5. Allowing for differences in technique, sub-4 mm right lower
lobe nodule is
not changed from [**2154**]. Without strong risk factor for
intrathoracic
malignancy, no further followup is recommended [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**]
guidelines.

TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2156-9-6**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly
higher.

TEE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is a small secundum atrial septal
defect with mild bidirectional shunting across the interatrial
septum at rest. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 45 cm from the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic, mitral, triucuspid
and pulmonary valves The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Small secondum ASD
with bidirectional shunt (small). Dilated main pulmonary artery.
Mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Globally hypokinetic
RV.

Renal U/S: no evidence of hematoma or abscess s/p biopsy

Head CT:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
Lucent area seen within the right frontal bone, most likely a
venous [**Doctor Last Name **]; however, please correlate clinically with history
of prior surgery or history of underlying malignancy. MRI may be
obtained for the latter.

STUDIES
Cardiac Catheterization [**11-9**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension despite supplemental
oxygen
and Flolan infusion.
2. Mild right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Normal left-sided filling pressures as reflected in the PCW.
