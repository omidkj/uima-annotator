Chief Complaint:
Mental status change
Reason for transfer: Status epilepticus

History of Present Illness:
84 year old woman with atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
diastolic CHF, CRI, and pulmonary hypertension who was admitted
from rehab facility to OSH for increasing somnolence. Pt had
recently been admitted to another OSH s/p and discharged to a
rehab facility. At rehab facility pt became increasing somnolent
and deteriorated to the point of only being responsive to
painful stimuli. She was taken to ED where she was found to be
confused and bradycardic. Digoxin levels found high, u/a with
evidence of UTI. Head CT MRI read as normal. Neurology
consulted; no focal deficits seen on exam but EEG revealed
status epilepticus with R temporal predominance. Loaded with
1400 mg Iv dilantin and transferred to MICU. Pt noted to have
progressively longer periods of apnea; ABG revealed
7.42/48/50/31, pt intubated intially on AC and weaned to
pressure support. Pt has also received vanocmycin, cefepime,
gentamicin and ciprofloxacin for UTI and question of pneumonia.
Pt subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for 24 hour EEG monitoring.

[**8-8**], [**8-9**] EEG
This 24 hour EEG telemetry initially was notable for a burst
suppression
pattern, followed by intermittent predominantly bitemporal
epileptiform
discharges and slowing within these same regions. At times, the
epileptiform discharges acquire a more rhythmic quality,
concerning for
an electrographic seizure. The background reaches a 10 Hz alpha
rhythm
but is remarkable for a generalized delta theta slowing. The
epileptiform activity significantly improves over the later
stages of
the recording. These findings are suggestive of an epileptogenic
focus
in the posterior temporal region, perhaps more so on the right.
Prolonged runs of more rhythmic appearing generalized discharges
are
concerning for limited electrographic seizures early in the
course of
the telemetry.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 84 year old woman with atrial fib, CHF, HTN in
non-convulsive status epilepticus also with recent digoxin
toxicity and UTI presented to this hospital for management of
her status epilepticus.  On presentation, the patient was
intubated (was in hypoxic, hypercarbic respiratory failure
secondary to apnea at OSH) and obtunded.  She was started on
propofol and continued on dilantin for presumed status
epilepticus.  The cause of seizing was unknown and the
differential included infection, stroke, or organic brain
injury.  The patient had been empirically started on meningitic
antibiotics.  The regimen was modified on transfer and included
vancomycin and ceftriaxone.  She was also started empirically on
acyclovir for possible HSV infection.  A lumbar puncture
performed on transfer was unremarkable with no evidence of
infection, all culture data was negative.  MRI/MRA brain was not
remarkable for stroke or bleed.
.
The patient was continued on propofol and dilantin.  Initial EEG
confirmed the presence of non-convulsive status epilepticus.
Dilantin doses were adjusted and keppra was added on.  Propofol
was transitioned to ativan drip as the patients blood pressure
was somewhat labile on propofol. After several days of an EEG
without seizure activity, the Ativan drip was weaned and
eventually discontinued. However, no obvious improvement in her
mental status was noted (despite sedation off for > 1.5 weeks).
The patient remained unresponsive. She was kept on ventilation
until it was decided after several family meetings to move
towards comfort measures only. A morphine drip was started and
the breathing tube was discontinued. Several minutes later, the
patient passed away. Her death was pronounced on [**9-5**] at
1.14pm.
.
The patient's other medical issues were managed as follows. Her
atrial fibrillation was managed with diltiazem or BB if her
blood pressured allowed. Her warfarin was discontinued since the
patient had a decreased hematocrit. She suffered from a GI bleed
and RP bleed. She also had a progressive leukocytosis up to
50.000. C.Diff was negative x 3, and all blood/sputum cultures
no growth.  She was empirically started on flagyl, but white
count continued to rise and she did not have any diarrhea.  No
definitive source for an infection was found until a colonoscopy
revealed findings consistent with C. diff colitis (vs ischemic
colitis).   She improved soon after having started her on PO
vancomycin and IV flagyl.  Later, a send out test for C.Diff
toxin B returned positive.  With regards to the Digoxin
toxicity, this drug was held throughout her hospital stay and
her acute renal failure was treated with IVF. Her diastolic CHF
was managed with antihypertensive and diuretic medications as
needed.
