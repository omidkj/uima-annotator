Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Azithromycin / Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Peri-ampullary mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Whipple's resection.
2. Open cholecystectomy.
3. Enteroenterostomy x2 (with formation of Roux limb for
pancreaticobiliary drainage).
4. Extended adhesiolysis.
5. Reduction of internal hernia.


History of Present Illness:
This 69-year-old retired gentleman was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for consultation for his bile duct obstruction problem by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]. He has a very interesting history of prior
abdominal surgeries including a gastric resection for peptic
ulcer disease followed by a revision with a Roux-en-Y and
partial gastrectomy in [**2143**].  He had thrived since then but
recently was admitted last month for pruritus, pain, and
jaundice.  He also had sepsis at that point.  An ERCP was
attempted to analyze the bile duct, but was unsuccessful due to
the reroute in his gastrointestinal system.  A percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiogram tube was placed to drain this and
remains in place now.  He was treated with antibiotics, and he
stabilized out. This has been analyzed radiographically, and
there is an obstruction in the bile duct at the area of the
ampulla.  There is clearly a mass there, and it appears to be
growing into the lumen of the duodenum.


Past Medical History:
HTN
PUD s/p perforation

wife and grown children very involved. He has 40 pack-year

[**2174-1-20**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: FS AMPULLARY ADENOMA, DUODENAL
MASS, Gall Bladder, WHIPPLE SPECIMEN.
DIAGNOSIS:
I. Ampullary adenoma (A-B):
Adenoma with small focus of intramucosal adenocarcinoma.
II. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (C-AN):
Adenocarcinoma of the duodenum, arising in an adenoma, see
synoptic report. Focal inactive pancreatitis with ductal
mucinous metaplasia.
Dilation of common bile duct. Rest of duodenum including
margins, bile duct margin and pancreas free of tumor.
III. Duodenal mass (AO-AS): Adenocarcinoma arising in an adenoma
with invasion into the duodenal wall.
IV. Gallbladder (AT-AU): Chronic cholecystitis. Choledochal cyst
lymph node with hyperplasia. No calculi or tumor.

Radiology Report CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2173-1-25**]
9:55 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Negative for PE.
2. Right lower lobe atelectasis and consolidation. There is
obstruction of
the right bronchus intermedius. Bronchoscopy should be
considered. .
3. Small amount of pleural fluid on the left with associated
atelectasis.
4. Unusual appearance of the left humerus, which is felt to be
the result of the artifact. However, plain radiography of the
left humerus is suggested when the patient's clinical condition
permits in order to confirm this suspicion.
5. Collection of gas and fluid subjacent to the anterior
abdominal wall in
the vicinity of several of the anastomotic sites. A drainage
procedure has
been planned.

Radiology Report CT GUIDANCE DRAINAGE Study Date of [**2173-1-26**]
2:09 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. The more inferior component of the complex gas and fluid
collection (the portion which was mostly fluid) was aspirated,
yielding, cloudy, pink fluid. This was sent for gram stain,
culture, and amylase.
2. A 10 French drainage catheter was placed into the more
superior aspect of the collection. Aspiration of the catheter
yielded bilious appearing fluid, which was sent for gram stain,
culture, and amylase.
3. Injection of the percutaneous biliary drain, demonstrated
extravasation of contrast outside of the confines of the
hepaticojejunostomy, with free
extravasation outside of the jejunal limb, collecting around the
region of the pigtail drainage catheter within the complex gas
and fluid collection.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 year old male with a pancreatic mass who went to
the OR on [**2173-1-20**] for a whipple procedure and extended
adhesiolysis.  Following the procedure, he was kept intubated
and intermittently on vasopressors and kept in the PACU
overnight for close monitoring post operatively.  He was
transfused 2 units RBC overnight for a low hematocrit.  He was
extubated on POD 1. He had a foley catheter in place, NG tube in
place, IVF for hydration and PCA for pain control and was
transferred to the surgical floor.

[**1-23**]: NG tube removed
[**1-24**]: Foley catheter removed, diet advanced to sips
[**1-25**]: diet advanced to clears, vancomcin and zosyn started, PO
medication started, d/c PCA, CT torso performed for tachypnea
and fever demonstrating no pulmonary embolus right lower lobe
atelectasis, consolidation, obstruction of the right bronchus
intermedius, and collection of gas and fluid adjacent to the
anterior abdominal wall in the vicinity of several of the
anastomotic sites.  Bronchoscopy performed.
[**1-26**]: Diet NPO, foley catheter replaced, CT guided drainage of
abdominal fluid collection performed, also injection of the
percutaneous biliary drain performed demonstrating extravasation
of contrast outside of the confines of the hepaticojejunostomy,
with free extravasation outside of the jejunal limb, collecting
around the region of t
