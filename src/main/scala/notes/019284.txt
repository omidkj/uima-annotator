Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Need for non-invasive ventilation and MICU stay.

History of Present Illness:
77F with h/o COPD and recent admit mid-[**Month (only) **] for afib w/rvr
discharged on coumadin and diltiazem BIBA from home after VNA
noted her to be tachycardic and with labored breathing at home
this AM. Received dilt bolus by EMS and started on dilt gtt w/o
improvement in her heart rate. Pt had dementia but had no
complaints. Endorsed chronic cough. Denied cp or sob.

In the ED, she was triggered for tachycardia with HR 150 and
continued on a dilt gtt. HRs improved to the low 100s prior to
transfer to the floor. CXR showed mild pulm edema with no
evidence of pneumonia. She received IVF and
Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. She was also noted to be febrile to
102.8, UA was sent and blood and urine cultures were drawn and
Tylenol was given. Cr was noted to be 1.4 with lowest previous
value of 1.1. ABG performed at 1200 was 7.34/45/220. Family
noted patient to become increasingly somnolent around 1400.

On the floor, the patient remained somnolent. Repeat ABG at 1700
was 7.24/60/68. Per family at bedside, patient is alert and
awake at baseline. Given somnolence and hypercarbia and DNI
status, the decision was made to transfer the patient to the
MICU. Prior to transfer, she received 20mg IV furosemide with
minimal output and Foley was placed.

Review of systems: Unobtainable [**3-15**] patient's somnolence.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4135**] is a 77 year old female with COPD, AF and dementia who
presented with tachycardia and respiratory distress, found to be
in AF with RVR and now transferred to the ICU due to somnolence
in the setting of hypercarbia.

#Altered Mental Status/hypoxemia: The patient was initially
admitted to the floor where it was noted that she was becoming
increasingly somnolent.  Alertness below baseline as per family
and ABG was 7.24/60/68. The patient was DNI and it was decided
to start BiPAP.  She was transferred to the ICU where she
steadily improved.  Etiology of decreased MS unknown but likely
multifactorial including hypercarbia, OSA and possible fluid
overload.  On [**8-19**], the patient was able to come off BiPAP to
facemask and was then changed to NC on [**8-21**]. She back to
baseline MS which is intermittently confused.  On CXR [**8-20**], it
appeared that the patient continues to be somewhat fluid
overloaded and the patient was started on prednisone/azithro for
the possibility of COPD exacerbation and given a 1x dose of
furosemide.  The patient continued to improve on [**8-21**] and she
was discharged to rehab.

#Atrial fibrillation: The patient was recently admitted for afib
with RVR likely secondary to hyperthyroidism.  Her HR was
initially controlled with a dilt drip and she was loaded with PO
dilt.  On day of discharge, the patient was taking dilt 90mg Q4
hours and her dilt drip was stopped.  HR remained in the
70s-80s.  The patient has been on warfarin 3mg daily which was
reduced today to 2mg in the setting of INR 2.9 and starting
azithromycin.

#Pulmonary edema: Patient's echo showed pulmonary hypertension
but no signs of acute heart failure, however, she consistently
had CXR with showed volume overload.  This was felt to be
related to flash from AF with RVR and treated with IV lasix
diuresis.  She continued to have a 6L NC oxygen requirement at
time of transfer to rehab, and further diuresis with lasix may
be considered if she worsens.

# Acute Kidney Injury: On admission, the patient's Cr was 1.4
(up from a baseline ~1.0).  Likely prerenal etiology and Cr fell
to 1.1 with fluids.  On day of discharge, the patient's Cr had
climbed back to 1.2.  A digoxin level was sent but was not
elevated.  Unknown etiology of slightly elevated Cr and will
work-up further if still elevated as an outpatient.

# Diabetes: Last A1c reportedly 6.6%. Glucose consistently in
200s, anion gap wnl. On [**8-21**] the patient was started on steroids
for possible COPD exacerbation.  Given risk of higher FS, she
was restarted on [**2-12**] dose of home Novolog 70/30.  Can increase
to full dose when PO intake improves.

# Hyperthyroidism: TSH <.02 during last hospitalization.  T4
normal during this admission.  No active issues, and the patient
was continued on methimazole.
