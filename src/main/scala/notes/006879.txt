Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain due to coronary artery disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2180-5-17**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. (Left
internal mammary->left anterior descending artery, saphenous
vein graft(SVG)->Posterior descending artery, SVG->Diagonal
artery, SVG->Obtuse marginal artery).


History of Present Illness:
73-year-old woman presented at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2180-3-12**] for nausea and vomiting.  She was found to have an abnormal
EKG in the emergency department and ended up having stress test,
which was positive.  Cardiac catheterization was subsequently
performed which revealed severe three-vessel disease.  She is
now referred for surgical management.  Her chief complaints at
this time are abdominal pain, prior nausea, and angina.  Cardiac
catheterization performed at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2179-3-17**] showed an LVEF of 45%, LAD 90% lesion, left circumflex 50%
lesion, RCA occluded, no MR, no AS, a patent left subclavian
artery and of note was severe aortic calcification.  Carotid
ultrasound also showed a left ICA stenosis of 50-69% and a right
ICA stenosis of 0-49%.  There is bilateral antegrade vertebral
flow.


Past Medical History:
Past medical history is significant for COPD, ventricular
tachycardia, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy,
hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular disease with noted left carotid
stenosis above, gastroesophageal reflux, type 2 diabetes, which
is managed with oral medications, juxtarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm measuring 3.5 x 5.1 cm, osteoarthritis, anxiety and
depression, diverticulosis, and left common iliac aneurysm
measured 2.8 cm.  She also has history of GI bleed and hiatal
hernia.  Also additional medical history is of spinal stenosis.

Past surgery is significant for cholecystectomy, tubal ligation,
and right subclavian bypass with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23638**]

Social History:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1968**] is retired.  She is edentulous. She is currently
smoking one pack per day and is attempting to cut back.  She
lives alone at this time.


Family History:
Family history is significant in her grandfather died of
myocardial infarction age 60 and her son had myocardial
infarction at age 32.  She has also strong family history of
elevated lipids.

Physical Exam:
60"  154#
On exam, her heart rate is 60 and regular.  Respirations rate
are 14.  Blood pressure on the right is 115/75 and on the left
108/74.  She is saturating 89% on room air.  She is in no
apparent distress.  Skin is warm and dry without any cyanosis,
clubbing, or edema.  She had normocephalic and atraumatic facial
structures.  Pupils are equally round and reactive to light.
Sclera is anicteric.  Oropharynx is benign.  She is edentulous.
No JVD is noted.  She has well healed right subclavian incision.
She does have delayed expiration, otherwise her lungs are clear
bilaterally.  Heart has regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2
tones noted.  No murmur, rub, or gallop is appreciated.  Her
abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended with positive
bowel sounds.  She does have pulsatile mass in her abdominal
aorta, which is appreciated approximated 4 to 5 cm on the left
medial quadrant.  Extremities are warm and well perfused without
any peripheral edema.  She does have mild superficial
varicosities.  Her greater saphenous veins appear suitable on
both sides.  She is alert and oriented times three. Her gait is
steady with nonfocal neurologic exam. She has a large
exploratory
lap incision.  She had four cholecystectomy.  She has
1+bilateral
femoral PT and radial pulses and trace bilateral DP pulses.  No
carotid bruit is appreciated on the right but there is faint
left
carotid bruit.


Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage.
3. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
4. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(LVEF = 45-55) with mild inferolateral wall hypokinesis.
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
is a complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta.
7. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
8. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
9. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
1. For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
2. Prebypass valvular and aortic findings remain unchanged.
3. Mobile aortic atheroma unchanged.
4. Global left ventricular systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55). Mild inferolateral wall hypokinesis persists.
5. Post bypass cardiac index normal (>2.5).
6. Aorta intact post-decannulation.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of prebypass and postbypass
findings.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-5-17**] for elective
surgical management of her coronary artery disease. She was
taken directly to the operating room where she underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. She later awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Went into A Fib and was
treated with amiodarone which converted back to SR. Chest tubes
removed on POD #2. Pacing wires removed on POD #3. Transferred
to the floor on POD #3 to begin increasing her activity level.
Cleared for discharge to home on POD #6. Pt. is to make all
followup appts. as per discharge instructions.
