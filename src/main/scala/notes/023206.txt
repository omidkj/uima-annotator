Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peritoneal Dialysis

History of Present Illness:
44 yo M w/ PMH of metastatic testicular germinoma, PCKD on PD,
b/l PE, presents with SOB. Pt was driving with his wife to [**Name (NI) 2860**]
for an appointment when he began to develop rapid shallow
breathing and felt short of breath. The patient was unable to
alleviate his shortness of breath and felt it was progressively
getting worse over 45 minutes. He denied CP, dizziness,
palpitations, loss of conscious. He drove into the [**Hospital1 18**] garage
where EMS was called and he was taken to the ED. He reports
altering his peritoneal dialysis protocol over the past couple
days so that he was retaining fluid, rather than removing fluid.

.
In the ED he was satting 80% on NRB. He was put on bipap with
satts improving to mid-90s. His CXR showed vol overload. Pro BNP
>70,000, wbc 12.9 wihtout bandemia, lactate 5.7, INR 3.4. He was
given IV lasix and started on nitro drip. He was off bipap and
was put on O2 by NC. His satts were 99%/6L. He also received IV
CTX and IV levoflox x 1.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2168-12-5**] 12:43 PM
FINDINGS: Upright portable AP chest radiograph obtained. Right
IJ central line is seen with its tip in the proximate location
of the superior vena cava. The heart appears enlarged. Low lung
volume somewhat limit evaluation, as does patient motion. There
is, however prominence of pulmonary vasculature, with indistinct
pulmonary hila. Findings are compatible with congestive heart
failure. There may be right basilar atelectasis and small
effusion. No pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour is unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Right IJ central line in acceptable position.
Cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure.

[**2168-12-6**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate to severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Borderline left ventricular cavity dilation with
moderate to severe global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process
(toxin, metabolic, cannot exclude multivessel CAD). Dilated
thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 44 yo M w/ PMH of metastatic testicular Ca, PCKD on PD, PE
p/w pulm edema in the setting of volume overload from
inappropriate .
.
#SOB: The patient's CXR showed bilateral infiltrates. This was
likely in the setting of improper peritoneal dialysis.  He was
initially in the ICU on nitro gtt until his PD could be
restarted.  Once his PD was restarted, greater than 3L fluid was
removed in 24 hrs with marked improvement of his respiratory
status.  He was initally on BiPap very shortly, and was then O2
by NC.  Prior to transfer to the floor, the patient was satting
>95% on RA.  The patient was given nebs, but did not require
them prior to discharge any longer.  He had BNP>70,000 even at
the time of discharge.  This could have been due to CHF
exacerbation vs volume overload from lack of PD.  An ECHO showed
an EF of 25-30%, though this could be depressed with massive
volume overload from lack of PD.  He should have a repeat ECHO
as an outpt by his PCP once his volume status is back to his
baseline.
.
# PCKD: Pt has h/o PCKD and is on PD chronically.  He had
stopped doing his PD properly prior to coming to [**Location (un) 86**] for his
[**Hospital1 4601**] appt which probably led to his volume overload.  The
patient understands that he needs to keep up with his PD.
During this hospitalization, the patient was followed by Renal
and he was restarted on his PD with a concentrated dialysate.
He will need to continue that regimen for [**12-22**] more days after
discharge, and he will f/u with [**Hospital **] clinic the afternoon of his
discharge to get the supplies he needs.  He has an outpatient
nephrologist in [**State 2748**] that he follows regularly with.
.
# CAD: The patient has no past h/o CAD. He presented with trop
of 0.1 with Sr Cr of 13. EKG showed diffuse TWI. No ST changes.
He had no prior available to compare. He was chest pain free
during this hospitaliziation.  A discussion of ACE and ASA was
done with the patient.  He will bring these up with his PCP
since he is on neither of these medications with a h/o diabetes
and a low EF.
.
# HTN/Tachycardia: He will continue his outpatient Metoprolol
dose.
.
# DM: The pt had h/o DM. At home he is on actos and amaryl.  He
was on ISS during this hospitalization, but was restarted on his
home medications at discharge.
.
# Testicular cancer: The patient was in [**Location (un) 86**] for a DF cancer
appt which he did not make given that he was unable to breathe
and presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  He has had many rounds of
chemotherapy in the past.  He will need to f/u with his
oncologist for further followup.
