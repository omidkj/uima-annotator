Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100949**] is a 75M with a PMH s/f type II DM, HTN, and
schizophrenia who presented with a chief complaint of substernal
chest pain at 6PM on [**2176-10-2**]. The pain started today at about
2PM when the patient was resting. He describes substernal chest
discomfort that radiated to his left arm, constant in nature,
[**4-18**] in severity, assoicated with nausea, and light headedness.
He denies any SOB, palpitations, or vomiting. He does report
that he gets a similar sensation with exertion (walking), which
is relieved with "relaxing". ROS in notably negative for any
orthopnea or lower extremity edema, although the patient does
report occasional PND.
.
In the ED, his EKG was consistent with an anterior STEMI. CKs
were 111 with an MB fraction of 6, and troponin was 0.07. He
recieved 5mg IV morphine, 325mg ASA, 0.8mg SL nitroglycerin, and
5mg IV metoprolol. A code STEMI was called, and the patient was
given a 5000 unit bolus of heparin, 600mg of [**Last Name (LF) 99970**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
eptifibitide drip was started, and he was taken immediately to
the cath lab.
.
In the cath lab, he had an episode of VF vs polymorphic VT for
~13seconds where he was unresponsive and pulseless. This
resolved with one shock. The patient was loaded with 100mg of
lidocaine followed by a drip at 2mg/hr. Cardiac catheterization
revealed 99% stenosis at the LAD into which a BMS was placed.
Integrillin had to be stopped secondary to gum bleeding.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for exertional chest pain,
and occaisiona PND. He denies any orthopnea, palpitions, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2176-10-5**] Chest CT: Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along
the thoracic aorta as well as along the coronary arteries.
Calcifications in the mediastinum and left perihilar region are
consistent with calcified lymph nodes. Mediastinal lymph nodes
measure up to 11 mm in short axis in the AP window. Trace
pericardial fluid or pericardial thickening is noted anteriorly.

There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The
central airways are patent. Patchy ground-glass opacities
predominantly in the right lower lobe are noted. While the
current study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis,
note is made of splenic artery calcifications.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No region of bony destruction is seen
concerning for
malignancy. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted, with
predominantly
anterior osteophyte formation.

IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe patchy infiltrate consistent with
pneumonia.

[**2176-10-2**] c. cath
1. Multi-vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior myocardial infarction treated with PTCA and
stenting
of the mid LAD with a bare metal stent.
3.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a 6F
Mynx closure device.

CARDIAC ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the mid- and distal segments of anterior
wall and septum, and akinesis of the apex. There is a 2.8 x 0.9
cm echodensity at the LV apex, suspicious for a thrombus (cine
loops #40-41), although image quality is poor and this could
also be an artifact. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion. Estimated pulmonary pressures are normal.

IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Possible LV apical thrombus.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year-old man with a PMH schizophrenia s/p STEMI w/ PCI to
LAD. ECHO demonstrated apical hypokinesis with wall thrombus.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Patient presented to ED with chest
pain. ECG demonstrated anterior ST elevations and a code STEMI
was called. Patient recieved PTCA with Bare metal stent (BMS) to
the LAD. His CK peaked at 1120 and TropT peaked at 4.28. He was
started on ASA, plavix and atorvastatin 80mg. He did not have
any further chest pain and ST elevations began to resolve on
night of cath. He was counseled repeatedly for > 4 minutes
regarding smoking cessation.
.
# APICAL HYPOKINESIS/THROMBUS: After intervention, Trans
thoracic echo was obtained and showed apical hypokinesis with
wall thrombus. Patient started on Coumadin with Lovonex bridge.
Can discontinue Lovonex when INR therapeutic ([**2-11**]). Continue
anti-couagulation until Cardiac follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**]
[**11-14**] 3 pm ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2037**]. ECHO scheduled for [**11-7**] at 10am, results will be followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] [**11-14**]
who will decide whether anti-coagulation should be continued or
thrombus has resolved.
.
# RHYTHM: Had a brief episode of polymorphic VT vs. VF in the
cath lab, likely ischemia mediated. Now revascularized without
any more ectopy. B-blocker decreased to Toprol 100 mg due to PR
prolongation.
.
# HEMOPTYSIS: Noted after PTCA in setting of gingival bleeding
after peri-procedural anticoagulation. This however self
resolved. A
