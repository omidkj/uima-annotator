baseline w/ melanic stool on exam, prompting NG lavage that was
normal. She was transfused 2units PRBCs, and admitted to MICU
for further care.

Imaging:
CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP: Comparison is made to prior study of
[**2153-9-6**]. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged.
Aortic calcifications are present. There is mild vascular
engorgement without frank pulmonary edema. The appearance of the
vasculature has improved in the interval. There is no
pneumothorax. No focal consolidations are seen.
IMPRESSION:Improved congestive heart failure.
.
[**10-2**] EKG: Sinus rhythm -
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot exclude in part
ischemia - clinical correlation is suggested Since previous
tracing of the same date, further ST-T wave changes present
.
Capsule endoscopy:
Procedure Info & Findings: Findings: Good prep 1. Polypoid
lesion
in stomach 2. Erythema and congestion at gastric antrum 3.
Duodenitis in duodenal bulb 4. Capsule did not reach the colon.
.
Summary & Recommendations: Summary: 1. Gastric polypoid lesion
2.
Gastritis. 3. Duodenitis in duodenal bulb. 4. Small nonbleeding
angioectasia small bowel, out of reach of enteroscope 5. No
active bleeding. Please check KUB prior to any MRI


Brief Hospital Course:
# Chest pain: Likely secondary to demand ischemia, as supported
by the pattern of pain similar to past anginal episodes and
dynamic ST depressions on EKG in the setting of low HCT.  Chest
pain resolved with blood transfusions.  Cardiac enzymes peaked
on HD#2.  Cardiology was consulted and determined that cath was
not indicated at this time given recent GI bleed.  Recommended
follow up in 1 month to reassess for possible catheterization
and ASA desensitization.  Pt was restarted on her statin,
metoprolol, and isosorbide dinitrate and remained
hemodynamically stable.  Patient was given one dose of plavix in
ED, plavix was held during the rest of the admission with plans
to restart when cleared by GI.
.
# GI bleed: Patient had guaiac positive stool on admission and
HCT 19, most likely due to UGI/bowel bleed. Hct remained stable
after 4 units PRBC and pt was hemodynamically stable. Pt was
transferred out to floor on HD 2. Pt had capsule endoscopy,
results returned after discharge, which showed a gastric
polypoid lesion, gastritis, duodenitis in duodenal bulb and a
small nonbleeding angioectasia in the small bowel.  The capsule
did not reach the colon, pt will need to have a KUB prior to any
MRI.  Patient was continued on protonix.  Plavix was held during
her hospitalization with plans to restart if the capsule
endoscopy was normal.  Patient will follow up with PCP to
recheck CBC and plan further GI work up.  Patient continued on
B12 and folate for anemia.
.
# CHF: Patient has h/o diastolic dysfxn.  Patient was given
lasix as needed with blood transfusions.  Patient was continued
on isosorbide dinitrate and metoprolol once hemodynamically
stable.  Continued on Lasix 40 mg QD.
.
# CKD: She has ESRD nearing hemodialysis.  AV fistula still
maturing.  Renal was consulted, no urgent indications for
dialysis during this hospitalization.  Continued calcium acetate
and phoslo.  Cr improved to 4.7 at discharge.  Will follow up
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
# DM2: Pt was given NPH for basal glucose control and covered w/
ISS. At discharge she was restarted on glipizide, will follow up
with PCP for further management.
