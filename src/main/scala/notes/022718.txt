Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization.
2. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy; electrocautery of [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]

History of Present Illness:
70 y/o male with HTN, hypercholesterolemia s/p inferior STEMI
with cath showing 50% LCx and 90% distal RCA, s/p cypher stent
to RCA.  Pt. received ASA, plavix, and integrillin in cath lab.
.
On floor in the evening post-cath, Pt. had large volume
melena/BRBPR.  Integrillin gtt was immediately d/c'd and volume
resuscitation initiated.  GI was contact[**Name (NI) **].  Pt. soon after
became nauseated and had lg. volume hemetemesis with frank clot.
 An NG-tube was placed and lavage revealed many clots, and
bloody fluid after 4L lavage.  Hct dropped from 36 to 23.  Pt.
received 4U pRBC via IV on floor and 2 doses of 40mg IV
protonix.  A right-IJ Cordis catheter was inserted at this time.
 The pt was evaluated by GI, with plan for emergent upper
endoscopy. Blood transfusions continued upon transfer to CCU
with protonix gtt. During EGD MAPs declined to 40-50s with
sedation, levophed started at 1 mcg/kg/min with improvement to
MAP 60-70s. A line placeed without incident. EGD further
complicated by continued bloody emesis with clots despite
erythromycin. Pt was intubated for airway protection.

TTE [**2171-3-4**]: The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrium
is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Resting regional
wall motion abnormalities include mild inferior hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior
report (images unavailable for review) of [**2170-5-11**], the LV
function was normal.
.
EGD [**2171-3-3**]: The entire esophageal mucosa was coated with fresh
blood. A 3-4 cm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear was seen spanning from
the distal esophagus to the GE junction. There was an adherent
clot at the distal end of the [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear near the GE
junction. There was no active bleeding. 5 cc Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**]
was injected around the adherent clot. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was
also applied for hemostasis successfully.  The stomach was
filled with dark blood and blood clots. The fundus was poorly
visualized due to a large pool of blood and clots that could not
be repositioned. There were no bleeding lesions in the stomach.
The duodenal mucosa was coated with fresh blood. A blood clot
was seen in the proximal bulb that was washed away with
irrigation. There were no bleeding lesions in the duodenum.
.
Cardiac cath [**2171-3-3**]: right dominant, 2V CAD. LMCA: no flow
limiting stenosis; LAD: mild disease; LCx: mild disease
proximally and a 50% stenosis in the mid vessel, OM1: moderate
diffuse disease in distal portion; RCA: subtotal occlusion in
distal vessel before the bifurcation of the PDA/PL branch. There
were left to right collaterals seen. LVEDP 26mmHg and RVEDP
11mmHg, c/w biventricular diastolic dysfunction. Mild PA HTN,
with PA systolic BP 47mmHg. Left ventriculography revealed
EF=54% with mild postero-basal HK. Cypher stent placed to RCA.


Brief Hospital Course:
70yoM with NSTEMI s/p cath (Cypher stent to RCA), with large
volume bleed from [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
.
# GI bleed: Likely due to pre-existing [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
exacerbated by integrillin which was given for cath procedure.
Emergent EGD revealed [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear in lower esophagus,
which was injected with epinephrine and electrocauterized.
Initially managed on protonix gtt, transitioned to IV, then to
PO.  Pt. received erythromycin to promote gastric motility.  Pt.
received 10U pRBC, FFP and platelets before hemorrhage was
controlled, and did not require additional transfusions after
electrocautery.  Pt. was on a levophed gtt briefly for
hypotension.  Due to concern for aspiration of hemetemesis, the
Pt. was intubated for the EGD, and started on empiric antibiotic
coverage for aspiration pneumonia consisting of vancomycin /
levofloxacin / metronidazole.  The Pt. received these
antibiotics for 3-days; they were stopped because the Pt. was
afebrile, with no elevated WBC count, and had no clinical signs
of infection.  The Pt. was weaned off ventilation without
complication, and was extubated and on room air within 2 days of
intubation.
.
# Cardiac: He came in with chest pain, found to have ST segment
elevation MI, underwent cardiac catheterization with RCA stent
for 90% occluded RCA.  He was started on ASA and plavix for
stent protection.  He was eventually placed on bet-blocker and
ACE-inhibitor once hemodynamically stable.  Tight glucose
control was maintained with an insulin sliding scale.  A left
ventriculogram revealed preserved EF, and diastolic dysfunction
(mild inferior HK). He was given IV lasix to promote diuresis of
excess fluids from IVF resuscitation and blood products, and was
euvolemic at the time of discharge.  The Pt. was monitored on
telemetry and remained in normal sinus rhythm with no
significant events.
