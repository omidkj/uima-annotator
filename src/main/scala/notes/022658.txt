History of Present Illness:
64 yo F with pmh significant for bronchiectasis presents with
respiratory distress. She states that on [**2136-8-23**] she went to a
storage facility where she keeps her belongings and her
possessions had been stolen. She related being in much distress
for the rest of the day and not feeling herself. She also states
that she had been feeling more SOB with cough lately. Around
midnight, she had increased coughing and SOB and asked her
daughter for a pill that her outside PCP in NY prescribed for
her. She says that it was not Levoquin, she thinks that it may
have been [**Date Range 54897**]. ~15 minutes after taking the [**Date Range 54897**], she began
to feel faint and her daughter noticed that her lips and the
area around her lips was beginning to turn blue. Her neck and
face became blue quickly after and she collapsed to the floor.
Her daughter called 911 and she began compressions per their
instructions. When EMS arrived, pt had a pulse but was not
breathing so they intubated her on the field and she was brought
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was given nebs, solumedrol, fent/midzolam. An
epipen was placed in her left thigh. She was also given H2
blocker and benedryl. For brief episodes of hypotension she was
given 5L NS and then placed on levophed and neo very shortly but
is currently not on pressors and has only PIVs. Per ED resident
she really turned around after epinephrine. Extubated in MICU
[**8-24**] without incident.
.
On medicine service, pt reports feeling very weak. She still
relates a persistent cough with some sputum without blood.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIOLOGY
[**2136-8-30**]   Cardiology ECG: Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2136-8-24**] no diagnostic
interim change.
[**2136-8-24**]   Cardiology ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Slight
non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2133-2-20**] sinus tachycardia is new.
RADIOLOGY
[**2136-8-30**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Plate-like right lower
lobe atelectasis, otherwise, improving basilar aeration without
new consolidations.
[**2136-8-27**]   Radiology RIB BILAT, W/AP CHEST: 1. No rib fracture
or malalignment identified. 2. Mildly improved atelectasis at
both lung bases compared to the prior study.
[**2136-8-26**]   Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT): Comparison is made with
prior study [**8-24**]. New left upper and bibasilar opacities
are most likely atelectasis, superimposed infection cannot be
totally excluded. Followup is recommended. There are low lung
volumes. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
There is mild cardiomegaly. Mild degenerative changes are in the
thoracic spine.
[**2136-8-24**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): AP chest compared to
[**8-24**] at 2:21 a.m.: Endotracheal tube is in standard
placement, at least 3 cm from the carina. Lungs are clear, heart
size normal. No pleural effusion or evidence of central
adenopathy. Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
view. No pneumothorax.
[**2136-8-24**]   Radiology CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON: 1. No acute
pulmonary embolism or aortic syndrome. 2. Mild bronchial wall
thickening with progressive intrathoracic lymphadenopathy since
[**2136-6-27**], likely due to infection/inflammation. 3. 5-mm
pulmonary nodules should be followed by dedicated chest CT in
one year. 4. Thyroid nodules could be further evaluated by
non-emergent ultrasound if indicated.
[**2136-8-24**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): 1. ETT too low, please
retract 1-2 cm. 2. Stable hilar lymphadenopathy.
