History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1124**] is 62 year old female with a history of small cell
lung diagnosed in [**2188**] status post chemo and x ray therapy,
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recurrent right
pleural effusion, pseudomonal pneumonia and respiratory failure
with tracheostomy in [**4-25**]. The patient was recently discharged
from a rehabilitation facility to home where she was doing well
using ventilation only at night when she experienced the sudden
onset of dyspnea on the day of admission. She was suctioned but
only had a transient improvement. EMS was called and the patient
was transfered to an outside hospital where she was
unresponsive. After receiving two nebulizer treatments and a
dose of unasyn she improved. There, she was changed to assist
control ventilation 400/12/40%/PEEP 5, following which she
became alert and responsive. She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. A chest x ray from the outside hospital
showed right pleural effusion and/ or right lower lobe collapse.

Chest X ray: Since the previous study there has been worsening
in the degree of bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion.
Unchanged right pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis of
the right lower lobe and the right middle lobe and possibly
necrotizing pneumonia in the right middle lobe and the right
lower lobe.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) The respiratory failure most likely secondary to mucous
plugging and it was thought that there was potential for
pneumonia or a COPD flare. The patient was started on zosyn for
treatment of pneumonia on [**8-16**] for a total of 14 days treatment.
A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed that showed thick
secretions in the right upper lung, right middle lung, and right
lower lung. Cultures grew out pseudomonas sensitive to
piperacillin/tazobactam. Ms. [**Known lastname 1124**] also underwent aggressive
suctioning, chest physical therapy, and treatment with
albuterol/ipratropium/fluticasone respiratory therapy. She was
also thought to be in mild heart failure, for which she received
small doses of IV lasix during her hospital stay.

2) Cardiomyopathy / hypertension: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1124**] was found to be in
mild acute renal failure so her hydrochlorothiazide was held on
admission; she remained normotensive on diltiazem, isosorbide
dinitrate, and hydralazine. Her creatinine normalized since
admission and she was able to resume her outpatient med regimen
once discharged to home. At one point during her course, she
developed asymptomatic atrial fibrillation that responded to
lopressor. It was decided not to rule her out for a myocardial
infarction since she was not a candidate for a

3) Hypothyroid: Ms. [**Known lastname 1124**] has a history of hypothyroidism for
which her synthroid was continued.

4) Acute Renal Failure: The patient was found to have a
creatinine of 1.5, up from 0.3. Her FeNa was not indicative of
pre-renal cause, and urine eosinophils were only mildly
positive. The patient's creatinine normalized over time and her
hctz was held during hospitalization. She was asked to resume
this at home.

5) Hyponatremia: Ms. [**Known lastname 6417**] hyponatremia was likely secondary
to sydrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone from her lung
process. Her serum osmolality was checked and she was fluid
restricted, leading to improvement.

6) Anemia: Ms. [**Known lastname 1124**] presented with a hematocrit of 24.3 and
tolerated a transfusion of 2 units of blood without
complications. It appeared to be secondary to iron deficiency
anemia in combination with anemia of chronic disease.

The decision was made to discharge Ms. [**Known lastname 1124**] home with nursing
care and potential bridge to hospice.
