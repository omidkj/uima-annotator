STUDIES:
CT/CTA Non contrast: There is no hemorrhage, major vascular
territory infarction, edema, mass, or shift of the midline
structures. Periventricular and subcortical white matter
hyperintensities are consistent with mild small vessel ischemic
changes and old lacunar infarctions.
 CTA: The basilar artery terminates at the level of the superior
cerebellar arteries and gives off two small caliber arteries
that
head towards the posterior communicating arteries. The bilateral
posterior communicating arteries are large caliber and feed
normal, patent posterior cerebral arteries. There is anatomical
variation is likely congenital. The remainder of the
intracranial
vasculature is patent without evidence of thrombosis stenosis or
vasospasm. The cervical vasculature is patent.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 67 year old male with history of cardiomyopathy with an EF of
25%, MI in [**2113**] s/p LAD stent, and HTN presented to OSH with
complaints of shortness of breath, palpitations and tachycardia
found to be in VT/SVT s/p cardioversion into sinus rhythm then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ICD implantation and LBBB workup.
.
## Wide Complex Tachycardia: Consistent with Polymorphic VT. He
was found to be in a wide complex tach, LBBB, right inferior
axis with Q waves in V1-V3.  This was consistent with VT from
the mid to basal anterior LV.  Seen on OSH EKG, and there was
refractory to Adenosine 6mg, 12mg, Amio, responded to
Synchronized Cardioversion into sinus rhythm. Etiology likely
multifactorial including past anterior MI, dilated
cardiomyopathy possibly d/t alcohol toxicity with ongoing
remodeling as patient was not on ACEI.  He was in sinus rhythm
upon transfer and was continued on Amiodarone 400mg daily.  In
addition, an ICD([**Company **] single chamber icd) was placed on [**8-29**]
via axillary vein for secondary prevention.  He decided to defer
VT ablation until he has recurrence.  In addition, he did not
receive BiV given low likelihood of benefit with large ant MI.
He was discharged to Rehab given his ongoing delirium, and will
follow-up in device clinic as an outpatient.
.
## Left Eye Nystagmus - on upward gaze with downbeat nystagmus.
Unclear duration of symptoms. CTA of Head and Neck, RPR and B12
analysis. CT head was negative, RPR negative, and B12 normal.
Given sxs of ataxia, nystagmus and encephalopathy a dx of
Wernicke's encephalopathy was made. IV Thiamine was started and
continued for 10 days until [**2127-9-9**].
.
## Delirium - pt was AAO to self only on arrival and improved.
On day of discharge could say the year is [**2126**], month is
[**Month (only) **], and date is the 10th. Not clear about day of week.
Etiology likely multifactorial. Long history of EtOH abuse,
combined with new hospital admission. Also pt has chronic gait
abnormality, which would be consistent with Wernickes. We
monitored his neurological exam and observed left eye
downbeating nystagmus on vertical gaze, neurology was consulted,
see recs and workup above. Unlikely infarct given imaging. No
electrolyte abdnormalities. Pt has no history of dementia and at
baseline is AAOx3 but with poor recall at times of hospital
course or illness. Pt will be discharged to Rehab with 24 hour
care and IV thiamine until [**2127-9-9**].
.
## Alcohol withdrawal: Pt did not have s/s of withdraw at [**Hospital1 18**],
however, OSH records note + s/s of withdraw requiring Ativan
drip. Pt drinks ~2 bottles of wine/night, and he has been
drinking for many years with a + hx of DT's in the past per his
wife.  [**Name (NI) **] had elevated LFTs at OSH, but were normal on arrival
