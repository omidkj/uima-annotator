Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
abd pain, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
83 year old female with h/o CBD stones, h/o CCY, Afib, HTN, and
T2DM who presented to an OSH ED with nausea and vomiting and was
found to have an impacted CBD stone, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ERCP.
.
She reports feeling unwell over the past 1 month.  She was
reportedly admitted to another hospital for a urinary tract
infection but her symptoms never truly improved.  She has been
taking Bactrim for the last several weeks for a UTI (unclear
when course finished as not on nursing home list).  She reports
nausea and vomiting x 10-14 days which acutely worsened last
evening when she had multiple episodes of nonbloodly nonbilious
vomiting.  Denies abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation or
bloody stools.  Does endorse some dizziness of the last few
days.
.
She was sent from her nursing home to [**Hospital3 **] where she
had a CT scan that showed a 9x6mm common bile duct stone
associated with dilation.  She was given gentamicin and Flagyl
(due to PCN and fluoroquinolone allergy) and 1L IVF.  Had
leukocytosis to 20.  Also was found to have a UTI and foley was
placed.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 97.8 102 101/52 18 100% RA.  She
started to become hypotensive to SBP 70's, given 500cc bolus and
SBP increased to 100's.  Has 18g and 20g for access.  Given
another 500cc bolus for BP in the 80's.  ERCP saw her in the ED
and plans to take her for ERCP tonight.  She was given a dose of
vancomycin.  Started on peripheral levophed prior to transfer.
Most recent vitals 104 (afib) 88/48 26 99%RA.
.
On the floor, she complains of feeling very anxious.  Also has
some nausea, but denies abdominal pain.  Requests that the team
leave her alone "even if it means I die."

[**5-8**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
global severe hypokinesis of the distal [**2-2**] of the ventricle and
preservation of basal function (LVEF is 30-35%). No
intraventricular thrombus is identified. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Significant mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents
a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe
global dysfunction of the distal [**2-2**] of the ventricle c/w lesion
of the mid LAD (wrap around) or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
Significant mitral regurgitatino. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2106-4-6**], left ventricular systolic
dysfunction is now identified. The severity of mitral
regurgitation is also likely increased.

[**5-8**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. LV systolic function appears depressed
(ejection fraction ? 30%) secondary to akinesis of the apical
[**2-2**] of the left ventricle with focal dyskinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2111-5-8**], severe mitral regurgitation is now
demonstrated.

[**5-9**] Chest xr
The ET tube tip is approximately 5.5 cm above the carina,
impinging the left tracheal wall and should be repositioned. The
NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Biliary stent is in place. There
is no change in cardiomegaly, mediastinal contours. The patient
is in mild interstitial engorgement, most likely related to
fluid overload but overall improved since [**2111-5-8**]
radiograph obtained at 04:32 a.m. Left retrocardiac atelectasis
and right retrocardiac atelectasis as well as bilateral small
pleural effusions are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old female with h/o cholangitis and CBD stones, Afib,
HTN, and T2DM who presents with sepsis secondary to cholangitis.
.
#. Septic Shock: Most likely from cholangitis given impacted
common bile duct seen on OSH CT, LFTs and RUQ tenderness on
exam.  Could also be urosepsis as source as has positive UA and
history of recent UTI.  Has onl
