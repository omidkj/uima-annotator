Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4616**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Transesophageal Echo
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
53 yoM fell from standing and hit his head on a table.  The
patient does not remember the event very clearly but he states
he remembers falling.  When asked the symptoms that preceeded
his fall he states that he may have had lightheadedness prior to
the fall.  In addition he is unable to answer what other
symptoms he may have had prior to the fall but answers "yes" to
all ROS questions.  He has no other specific complaints,
although he is hungry.

At this current time he has no CP, SOB, HA, fever, chills,
urinary symptoms, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain or any
other symptoms.

The patient presented after his fall to [**Hospital6 302**]
where he was noted to be in atrial flutter with RVR, rate of
150.  He rec'd ativan (no h/o recent ETOH use per patient,
however, per home health nurses patient does still drink), dilt
10mg IV x 2, lopressor 50mg po x 1 and he was started on a
diltiazem drip.  He then underwent a CT of his head which was
concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He underwent an MRI
without contrast at [**Hospital 15405**] and was then transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ER.

In the [**Hospital1 **] ER he underwent repeat CT and this read as negative,
his MRI was read as possible gyrohyperdensities in the L
parietal lobe which could be infectious versus malignant.
Repeat MRI with contrast was recommended.  The patient was also
given 60mg PO dilt and continued on a dilt drip at 5mg / hr.  He
was also given 2g calcium gluconate.  He had a CXR with a L
pleural effusion and was given vanc/zosyn/azithro.

In the ED, initial VS:  T 96.8 HR 80-110 BP 92/47 RR 16 O2 sat:
98%.  VS prior to transfer to the floor: T 96.7  GBP 97/59  HR
103  96% on 4L.  The patient has 2 PIV.  Rec'd 3L of IVF and had
400cc UOP.

Past Medical History:
Seizure d/o (on valproic acid)
Hyperlipidemia
Schizoaffective disorder
Asthma / COPD
HTN
ETOH abuse (per pt sober x 1 year)

Social History:
Patient lives alone. Has visting nursing aid 5 days/wk and
visiting nurse 3 days/wk.  He chain smokes.  He has history of
alcohol abuse but has not drank in over a year.  He is largely
independent of ADLs and can run simple errands by himself.

Family History:
Mother died almost 30 years ago. Patient has not had contact
with his father.  [**Name (NI) **] has a single living sister [**Name (NI) 2048**] [**Name (NI) **].
He has one sister who is deceased.

Path:
[**3-5**] FNA from bronch of mediastinal mass: Fine needle aspiration
of mainstem: Single fragment of atypical squamous cells,
insufficient for diagnosis; please see cytology report
(C10-[**Numeric Identifier 63202**]) for diagnosis

[**3-5**]: Bronch cytology consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

[**3-4**] Bronch: Suspicious for malignant cells. Rare clusters of
highly atypical epithelioid cells with high N:C ratios and
prominent nucleoli.

[**3-4**] Pleural fluid: Rare cluster of atypical epithelioid cells
in a background of lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages and
mesothelial cells.

IMAGING:

[**2172-3-2**] EKG: Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
Axis appears to be right axis deviation although is difficult to
assess. Borderline low limb lead QRS voltage. Right
bundle-branch block. Delayed R wave progression. Modest ST-T
wave changes. Findings raise the consideration of possible
chronic pulmonary disease, right ventricular overload and
possible prior anterior wall myocardial infarction.

[**2172-3-3**] EEG: This is an abnormal video EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of the background rhythm with bursts of
generalized
suppression. In sleep, note is made of intermittent generalized
sharp
waves with bifrontal predominance with a triphasic morphology of
unclear
significance. No electrographic seizures were seen during this
recording and this telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.


[**2172-3-3**] MRI Brain w/ contrast: Focal enhancement and edema
centered around the left postcentral gyrus is concerning for a
mestastasis given the location and large pulmonary mass on the
chest CT. Additional differential considerations would include
infection or a primary brain tumor. The appearance would be
unusual for a vascular malformation, despite the prominent
superficial vessel, and also unusual for an evolving infarct. A
repeat study with the leads removed and addition of perfusion
sequences would be useful in further evaluation.

[**2172-3-3**] CT Chest w/o contrast:
1. Locally invasive mass centered within the left hilum,
extending to and abutting the left side of mediastinum,
associated with secondary atelectasis of the left upper lobe and
an organized left pleural effusion. Pulmonary metastases in the
ipsilateral and contralateral lungs. These findings are
compatible with stage IV disease.
2. Borderline-sized mediastinal adenopathy.
3. Small airways disease.

CTA Chest w/ & w/o contrast:
1)Large infiltrating mass in the left hilum extending along the
occluded left pulmonary vein into the left atrium and
circumferentially encasing and infiltrating the left mainstem
bronchus with compression of the lingular bronchus and subtotal
compression of the left lower lobe bronchus causing atelectasis.

2)Mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
3)Multiple pulmonary nodules, presumed metastases, in both
lungs.

[**2172-3-2**] CXR: Left-sided pleural effusion with left basilar
atelectasis. No
overt CHF. Please note study is limited and if needed, a PA and
lateral view can be performed to better assess

[**2172-3-3**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. A highly mobile
small to medium sized mass (0.8 x 0.8 cm) is seen in the body of
the left atrium which appears to possibly be attached to the
base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (differential
diagnosis included thrombus, myxoma, vegetation, papillary
fibroelastoma). This is best seen in clips 9, 11, 126. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusio
