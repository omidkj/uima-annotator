catheterization.  The patient arrived pain free to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory.

following:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
4.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2164**], status post partial gastrectomy secondary to peptic
ulcer disease, status post pilonidal cyst excision.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to DEMEROL AND VALIUM.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
2.  Glyburide 5 mg q.d.
3.  Glucophage 500 mg b.i.d.
4.  Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
6.  Lopressor 200 mg b.i.d.
7.  Imdur 30 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the
following:  The patient was pain free and anxious.  He had
stable vital signs.  Carotid examination was within normal
limits.  HEART:  Heart was regular rate and rhythm without
murmur.  LUNGS:  Lungs were clear.  Pulses were 2+ palpable
peripherally.  He had no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values were unremarkable upon
admission with the exception of a creatinine of 1.4 and
glucose of 363.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory, where he was found to have three
vessel coronary artery disease with a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 45%.  Cardiothoracic surgery
consultation was obtained.  The patient was seen the
following day by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and coronary artery bypass
graft was recommended at that time.  The patient was taken to
the operating room on [**2170-4-26**], where he underwent
coronary artery bypass graft times three with saphenous vein
to the LAD, saphenous vein to the OM and saphenous vein to
the PDA.  Postoperatively, the patient was transported from
the operating room to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in
stable condition.  The patient was on Neo-Synephrine,
propofol, and insulin IV drips.

By postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned from his
drips.  He was weaned from the mechanical ventilator and
extubated.  He remained hemodynamically stable.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was transferred from the
cardiac surgery recovery unit to the telemetry floor in
stable condition.  The patient was begun on beta blockers and
diuretic on postoperative day #2.  Oral hypoglycemic agents
were reinstituted.

On postoperative day #3, the patient's chest tubes were
discontinued.  He remained hemodynamically stable.  He was
begun with physical therapy and ambulation.  He continued to
progress on a satisfactory postoperative course.

On [**4-30**], postoperative day #4, the patient has remained
hemodynamically stable.  The patient had some difficulty
voiding yesterday.  However, the patient has had the Foley
since removed, and he has voided without difficulty.  This
morning, he has been slow to progress with physical therapy
and ambulation stating that he is too weak.  He has not
progressed well with cardiac rehabilitation.  For that
reason, it is recommended that he go to a rehabilitation
facility to continue with physical therapy and
rehabilitation.

Condition today is stable.  Vital signs revealed the
following:  Temperature 98.3, pulse 84, blood pressure
127/74.  He is on a two liter nasal cannula right now with
oxygen saturation of 95%.  Physical examination was
unremarkable.  He is intact neurologically.  Pulmonary
examination revealed the following:  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Coronary examination is regular
rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is benign.  Sternal and leg
incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  Extremities are warm
with 1+ edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glucophage 500 mg p.o.b.i.d.
2.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  Protonix 40 mg q.d.
4.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Zocor 20 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
7.  Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.
8.  Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. for one week.
9.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o.b.i.d. times one week.
10. Sliding scale regular insulin coverage for blood glucose
as follows:  Before meals and at bedtime:  Glucose of 150 to
200, three units subcutaneously; 201 to 250, six units; 251
to 300, nine units; 301 to 400, twelve units.

The patient is also recommended to take Flomax 0.4 mg
p.o.q.h.s., but the patient has previously refused that
medication due to reported gastrointestinal upset from this
medication.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient is to followup with
Dr.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] approximately six weeks after surgery.
The patient is also to followup with the primary care
