Allergies:
Hydrocodone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
67 /o F w/ PMHx of COPD on home O2, Lung cancer s/p resection
presented with worsening SOB. Initially admitted for SOB worse
than baseline occuring at rest and limiting activity for [**5-1**]
days. She had low grade fevers associated with this SOB and a
mild episodic cough with production of yellowish sputum. She
also complained of substernal chest pain on admission.
.
She was admitted for evaluation, she was ruled out for MI. A
chest CT was performed to rule out PE which showed chronic
emphysema.
.
Overnight prior to transfer she had episodes of shortness of
breath with desaturations into the 80s. She was given multiple
nebulizers with some minor improvement. She was noted to be
choking and some food was found in her mouth. She was suctioned
and her secretions were noted to be thick. On the floor she had
increased shortness of breath and was in severe respiratory
distress. An ABG was sent and was 7.33/79/84, the quantity of
FIO2 was decreased and a repeat ABG was 7.29/88/80. Based upon
this it was felt she was tiring so she was transfered to the ICU
and intubated for respiratory distress.

Past Medical History:
1. Lung cancer, s/p partial resection of left lung (?left upper

lobe) and radiation therapy. No chemotherapy. Treatment was at
[**Hospital1 336**].
2. Emphysema, on home O2
3. Chronic hoarseness secondary to radiation therapy
4. Hypothyroidism
5. s/p tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy
6. Early menopause (age 28), never on hormones
7. On diltiazem, unknown why. Patient denies hypertension,
irregular heart rate.

Social History:
Divorced woman, currently living at [**Hospital3 2558**]. Has brother
in [**Name (NI) 3146**] and son in [**State **]. Used to work as private nurse's
aide. Reports 2 ppd since age 7 (~60 years) and now down to 1
cigarette per day x7 months (since moving in to [**Hospital3 2558**]).
Says she takes off oxygen when she smokes. Used to drink alcohol
3-4 times per
week, and would have [**6-7**] cans of beer at one time. No alcohol
for 3 years. Denies any other recreational drugs.

Family History:
Doesn't know any other family history because "I never see
them."

Physical Exam:
Temp 98, Pulse 93, BP 136/80, Sats 95% on 100% face mask
Post extubation P 97, BP 91/50 RR 16 O2 sat 100%
Gen: cachectic female in clear respiratory distress unable to
complete full sentences.
HEENT: MM dry, OP clear
Heart: RRR, nl S1S2, no m/r/g
Lungs: distant sounds, decreased air movement bilaterally, no
wheezing
abd: s/NT/ND
Ext: no edema

Pertinent Results:
Lung VQ Scan
Diffuse airway disease. With this degree of disease manifest by
clumping it is likely that a perfusion scan would be
nondiagnostic.
CTA Chest
1. No acute pulmonary embolus.
2. Moderate mainly centrilobular emphysema throughout.
3. A least 2 small(sub 6mm) areas of nodularity m nonspecfic,
and unlikely to be clinically significant, but interval follow
up in 6 months should be considered to ensure stability.
Chest Xray [**10-13**]
Interval collapse of the left lung, most likely from an
obstructing mucus plug given the acuity.
Chest Xray [**10-14**]
Expansion of left upper lobe

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress - Patient with known baseline emphysema
and lung resection p/w with worsening shortness of breath. CTA
showed no evidence of PE, also has been ruled out for MI. Most
likely this is COPD exacerbation with possible aspiration
pnemonia vs. viral illness. She had fever, cough, sputum w/
elevated white counts with no infiltrate on CXR.  During the
hospital stay, developed aspiration PNA and was intubated and
ventilated. She had a favorable recovery post-intubation. She
was continued on Combivent nebs, Prednisone, Theophylline
(levels were monitored). She was also started on Levofloxacin
for presumed PNA (to be continued for 5 days after discharge).
Pt to benefit from Chest PT.
.
# Speech and Swallow eval: done and S&S suugested pureed solids
and thin liquids and to advance diet cautiously.
.
# Lung Collapse: She developed total left lung collapse on [**10-13**]
most likely secondary to mucus plugs. Respiratory suctioned her
and repeat Xray the next day showed interval expansion of left
lung.
.
# ARF: Creatinine elevated to 1.6 on admission which eventually
trended down.
.
# UTI: intial UA showed RBC [**11-15**], WBC >50, Epi [**2-28**]; likely
contaminated. A repeat Cx negative.
.
# Hypothryoidism: TSH levels normal, was continued on
levothyroxine
.
# Dispo planning: the patient will benefit from chest PT as she
is prone to mucus plugging. PT was involved w/ patient while in
hospital. Also continue Levofloxacin for 5 days post-discharge.
.
# Code Status: was discussed w/ patient and she wanted to be
DNR/DNI after she came out of the intubation in intensive care
unit.
