Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 69-year-old gentleman who was admitted to the
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] from an outside hospital. The
patient had presented with a change in
mentation. He was found on outside hospital CT scan to have an
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension to the ventricle,
across the ventricle, an extensive
intraventricular clot, hydrocephalus with distention of the
temporal wounds. The patient was transferred [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]
Medical Center for management. The patient had incipient
herniation. Therefore, an emergent left-sided high frontal
EVD was placed in the ER, follow up head CT showed good
placement of drain. He was started on Mannitol, Decadron and
Dilantin
A Stroke Neurology consult was obtained on day one they
recommended, cont Mannitol 25 g IV q6h, Dexamethsone 4 mg IV
q8h,  Phenytoin 100 mg IV q6h ,RISS
SBP goals less than 160 and MAPs <130, and keeping the patient.
Normothermia/Normoglycemia
A hematology consulted due the patients frequency of nose bleed
and numerous blood studies were sent which were all normal.
An MRI rule out any underlying lesions and CTA rule out an
anuersymal source for the bleed.
On hospital day 2 the patients EVD clotted off and a new EVD was
placed, and [**Hospital1 **] TpA was started throughout the hospitalization.
The patients neurologic exam remained poor he would move left
arm spontaneously which improved daily where he moved it more
frequently.  Initially he would only withdraw his right hand to
pain and his legs.  Prior to being made CMO he spontaneoulsy
moving all his extremities except his right arm which would
withdraw to pain.
We discussed the grave prognosis with his family and had
multiple meetings with social work and daily updates they wanted
to proceed with full care knowing the possible outcome may be
nursing home care.  Mr [**Known lastname **] had CT scans showing resolving
blood in ventricular system.
On [**1-23**] he began developing persistent fevers eventually cultures
grew out moraxecella out of his sputum, ID was eventually
consulted and he was started on Vancomycin for his
ventriculostomy drain and thought would provide better coverage
for his fevers, other sources of fever were ruled out and he was
thought to have a central fever.
On [**1-28**] the family was approached about giving Mr [**Known lastname **] a PEG and
Trach and they decided not to proceed with those procedures and
to make him CMO.
On [**1-29**] he was extubated and over the course of the next day he
expired on the evening of [**1-30**].
