Micro:
Urine [**7-29**] -NGTD
Blood Cx x 2 [**7-29**]- NGTD
Sputum Cx [**7-29**]- NGTD
Sputum Cx [**7-30**]- sparse Yeast, rare GNR (2 colonial morphologies)
Urinary Legionella Ag [**7-31**]: Negative
.
CXR, [**8-1**]: When compared with prior study, there has been
interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. A right
internal
jugular central venous catheter terminates in the upper superior
vena cava. This is unchanged in position since prior study. When
compared with prior exam, there is mild interval hilar fullness,
and pulmonary vascular redistribution. Again noted is a left
retrocardiac opacity, and opacification of the left upper lung
zone consistent with pneumonia/atelectasis. The surrounding soft
tissue and osseous structures again reveal bilateral shoulder
prosthesis, and scoliosis/degenerative changes of the spine.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter in unchanged
position with the tip in the upper SVC.
2. Stable/slight interval worsening CHF.
3. Stable left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis. Stable left
upper lobe opacification.
.
Echo, [**7-30**]: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
(non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the basal septum. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed with hypokinesis of the
mid antero-septum, distal septum, and mid to distal anterior
wall including the apex. The remaining segments are
hyperdynamic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:
.
1. Hypotension- thought to be [**1-1**] Septic shock [**1-1**] PNA.  ?
element of Adrenal Insufficiency
- Pt initially required Levophed to support BP -> weaned off
night of [**7-30**] -> [**7-31**]
- [**Last Name (un) **] Stim Test: Cortisol 34 -> 36 -> started on Hydrocortisone
50 mg IV Q6 on [**7-30**]
- Fluid resuscitation as needed with LR and PRBCs
- checked Echo in case there was cardiogenic component to
hypotension -> EF 40-45%, hypokinesis of the mid antero-septum,
distal septum, and mid to distal anterior wall including the
apex, mild MR, mild PA HTN
- BNP 12,292 on [**7-29**]
- treatment of Sepsis as below
.
2. Sepsis- thought to be [**1-1**] PNA
- Sputum and Blood cultures sent -> [**7-29**] sputum NURF, [**7-30**]
sputum grew rare GNR, yeast, [**7-29**] urine cx and blood cx x 2 NTD
- started on Vanc, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin on [**7-29**] for
empiric tx of PNA -> Vanc d/ced on [**8-1**]
- IVF as necessary
.
3. Resp Failure- thought to be [**1-1**] Sepsis and RLL PNA +/-
element of Narcotic OD
- Intubated [**7-29**] -> weaned -> extubated on [**7-31**]
- Bronchodilators PRN wheezing
- Treated PNA with Vanc, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin
- Pt. had a hypoxemic event overnight [**7-31**] -> [**8-1**], unresponsive,
SBP 70s, O2 Sat 80s, hypoventilation 8-9 -> Head CT,
electrolytes, glucose normal -> thought to be [**1-1**] mucous
plugging- no pulm edema on exam, no signs of R heart strain on
EKG, team had low suspicion of PE as pt. recovered so quickly
- checked LENIs [**8-1**] -> not yet read
.
4. Elevated Troponins- thought to be [**1-1**] demand ischemia, not
primary cardiac event, as there were no EKG changes, no chest
pain
- BNP 12,292 on [**7-29**]
- troponins 0.33-0.56 from [**7-29**] to [**8-2**], CK-MB 15 on [**7-30**] ->
decreasing
.
5. [**Name (NI) 3674**] Chronic, unclear etiology, B12/Folate normal.
Ferritin, TIBC normal, could be [**1-1**] CRI
- guaiced all stools
- transfused 2 U PRBCs overnight [**Date range (1) **]
- checked hemolysis labs: T bili 0.1, Haptoglobin 177 -> likely
not hemolyzing
.
6. Thrombocytopenia- Plt 252 [**7-30**] -> 150 [**7-31**]
- all Heparin products held
- HIT Ab sent -> pending
- Plts stable around 150s
.
7. [**Name (NI) 1622**] Pt. experienced significant pain over MICU course, on a
significant amount of pain medicine at home
- originally on Fentanyl drip and Midazolam drip -> Midazolam
weaned off, Fentanyl transitioned to patch
- Ativan 1 mg Q4-6 PRN
- restarted Methadone 50 mg QD on [**8-2**]
.
8. CRI- baseline Cr seems to be 1.4-1.8, most likely [**1-1**] HTN
- Cr 2.0 on [**7-29**] -> down to 1.
