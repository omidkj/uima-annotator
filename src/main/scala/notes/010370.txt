Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD
who presents today with worsening shortness of breath.  Since
the beginning of this year, she was admitted three times for the
similar complains where her AMS resolves after her respiratory
function is maintained.  Each time, she improved after treating
CHF and COPD exacerbation.  She was sent from [**Location (un) **] Nursing
home for SOB and altered mental status.  Most recently, her
amiodarone was stopped and she was suppose to start Digoxin
based on last discharge summary.  Nursing home staff is unsure
of when the AMS or SOB started.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.0 P 140 BP 128/95 R 36 O2 100
sat. Pt was noted to be tachy to 130's in AF, mostly wheezing on
exam not much crakles, lethargic, too SOB to talk.  Patient was
given Ipratropium Bromide Neb, Albuterol 0.083% Neb; solumedrol,
Nitroglycerin (for HF); Acetaminophen (for a temp of 102.6
rectally); Piperacillin-Tazob and Vancomycin.  Patient came in
NRB, now on bipap.  CXR c/w vascular congestion.  No lasix was
given.
.
On the floor, patient was on a none-rebreather, awake, in
moderate distress.

 CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2121-2-25**] 5:13 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-24**], there is
continued enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette with left ventricular prominence. Mild
fullness of
pulmonary vessels again is consistent with elevated pulmonary
venous pressure.
Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again seen with
atelectatic changes
above it in the retrocardiac region.

Degenerative changes about both shoulders and the thoracolumbar
spine are
again seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of Breath - CXR on admission was suggestive of fluid
overload vs infiltrate. She was on BiPap briefly in ED but
quickly weaned to nasal cannula in the ICU.  BNP was elevated
(29,000's), making clinical presentation most consistent with
acute on chronic hear failure, and thus she was diuresed.
Subsequent CXR were unimpressive for an infectious cause.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained negative.  She was
initially started on treatment with vancomycin and zosyn for
presumed healthcare-associated pneumonia. Antibiotics were
eventually discontinued on HD2 given significant improvement in
respiratory status after diuresis and little concern for
infection.  She remained stable from a respiratory standpoint
with oxygen saturations in the high 90s% on room air.  She was
not labored or tachypneic with her breathing.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130s
on night of admission.  She was continued on her outpatient
medications.  Metoprolol was initially held in setting of low
blood pressures (see below) however, this was
restarted as her pressures improved.  She remained on coumadin
and digoxin.  She was found to have an INR of 1.4 that was
subtherapeutic, we continued on her home dose coumadin given
renal failure and concurrent antibiotics.  On discharge the
patient's metoprolol was uptitrated to allow for improved heart
rate control.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine was
elevated at 2.1 from baseline in 1.6.  Thought to be pre-renal
with a posible component from Multiple myeloma.  Medications
were renally dosed.  Electrolytes were trended daily and
creatinine eventually trending back down to her baseline.
Creatinine was 1.6 on discharge.
.
# Coronary artery disease: Troponins were cycled and remained
flat (0.09->0.05). Thought to be due to minimal component of
demand ischemia from hypotension in setting of renal failure.
Remained on aspirin, beta-blocker initially held in setting of
low blood pressure but was then restarted.
.
# Hypotension: hypotensive on admission thought to be due to
congestive heart failure vs. sepsis.  Pressures improved after
initial treatment of acute heart failure.  Antibiotics
eventually were discontinued.  Home antihypertensives were
initially held but were then restarted.
.
# Depressed mental status: She was, at times, sleepy and
difficult to arouse from sleep.  After discussion with the
family and nursing facility, it was determined that this was her
baseline mental status.
.
# Multiple myeloma - required no management during admission.
Creatinine and electrolytes were trended daily.
.
# Anemia: Likely due to multiple myeloma. Remained stable at
baseline.
.
# Seizure Disorder: no seizure activity noted during ICU
admission. Dilantin level checked and found to be within normal
limits. She was continued on dilantin at a dose of 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# COPD/chronic bronchitis: remained on home nebulizer treatment,
given a burst of steroids for her treatment that does not need
to be continued upon discharge.  Was successful at weaning down
her O2 requirement.
