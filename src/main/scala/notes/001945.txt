RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2126-1-8**] 9:49 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: r/o inf., eff

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman with CAD for CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o inf., eff
HISTORY: Status post CABG, evaluate for infiltrate or effusion.

FINDINGS: AP chest radiograph compared to [**2126-1-3**].
There has been interval extubation and removal of the
[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube. There has been interval removal of the
Swan-Ganz catheter (via the right IJ) as well.

The previously seen retrocardiac density has improved. The
pulmonary edema has resolved. The enlarged postoperative
mediastinum is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Resolution of pulmonary edema and decreased left
basilar atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19688**] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization.
During the procedure, the right coronary artery could not be
engaged as there was a significant amount (approximately 7mm) of
previously placed stent jutting out into the lumen of the aorta.
The right coronary artery appeared to have a severe ostial
stenosis despite the presence of the previously placed multiple
stents. The LMCA, LAD and LCx had no angiographic evidence of
coronary artery disease. Distal aortography was also performed.
This demonstrated a large plaque in the aorta just distal to the
renal arteries.  There was mild-moderate arterial disease in the
right and left iliac arteries and mild arterial disease in the
right common femoral artery. Based on the above results, cardiac
surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed. An
echocardiogram on [**1-1**] was notable for 2+ mitral
regurgitation and depressed left ventricular function with an
ejection fraction of 30%. Preoperative evaluation was otherwise
unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery.

On [**1-2**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed single vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting along with a mitral valve repair. He also
removed the stent from the right coronary ostium via aortotomy.
The operation was otherwise uneventful and she transferred to
the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. She maintained stable
hemodynamics as she weaned from inotropic support. She
intermittently required intravenous Nitroglycerin for
hypertension. Given her cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular
disease, her SBP was maintained between 120-140 mmHg. She
remained mostly in a normal sinus rhythm. Very briefs episodes
of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were noted on telemetry, most
likely in the setting of hypokalemia. K and Mg levles were
monitored closely and repleted per protocol. Most of her
preoperative medications were resumed. She made steady progress
and transferred to the SDU on postoperative five. Her blood
sugars remained well controlled. Beta blockade was slowly
advanced as tolerated. She remained in a normal sinus rhythm
without further episodes of atrial fibrillation. Over several
days, she continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis
and made steady progress with physical therapy. She was cleared
for discharge to rehab on postoperative day seven. At discharge,
her chest x-ray showed resolution of pulmonary edema with
decreased left basilar atelectasis. Her BP ranged from the
104-114/50-60's with a heart rate in the 70-80's. Her room air
saturations were 95%. All surgical wounds were clean, dry and
intact without evidence of infection. She had adequate pain
control with Tramadol and Motrin. She was discharged to rehab in
stable condition on POD#8.
