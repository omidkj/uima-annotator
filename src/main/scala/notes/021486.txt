Pertinent Results:
CT:
[**4-28**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Acute right cerebral subdural hematoma. Unchanged leftward 3
mm subfalcine herniation. Small left frontal acute subdural
hematoma.
2. Large subgaleal hematoma overlying the right frontal bone.

[**5-1**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the moderate-sized right and small
left subdural hematoma, with stable minimal subfalcine
herniation.
2. No evidence of major vascular territorial infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**4-28**] from OSH after having been found
face down on the floor at her apartment building. She had a CT
scan showing a right sided subdural hematoma approx 1.5cm at
largest width the majority is 1.0cm with approx 5mm of shift
though sulci with only mild effacement.

She was then admitted to the ICU for q1h neurochecks and ongoing
evaluation of her subdural bleed. She was successfully weaned to
extubation on [**4-30**] and subsequently transferred to the
neurosurgery step down unit.

On [**5-1**], she had worsened mental status and was emergently sent
for a CT scan to evaluate for new hemorrhage vs stroke. CT was
stable for bleeding, and negative for new infarct. She had
worsening renal failure with Cr 3.5 (2.0 on arrival).  Yesterday
she demonstrated mixed metabolic/respiratory acidosis with pH
7.24 and was subsequently intubated and now on ventilator.  She
continues to have an anion
gap metabolic acidosis. We continue to suspect that most of her
exam is secondary to metabolic encephalopathy given that it is
non focal. Neurology was consulted for evaluation of a possible
seizure condition that may be causing the episodes in the
absence of new bleeding or infarct.  EEG was ordered and showed
no clinical or electrographic seizures. Low amplitude mixed
frequency generalized slowing along with bursts of superimposed
slowing and brief periods of suppression were observed. This is
most consistent with a severe encephalopathy and deep midline
dysfunction.

On [**5-2**] a family meeting was held and the gravity of the
situation was adddressed with the family that a meaningful
recovery would not be likely. The family decided to make her CMO
and she passed away on [**5-3**].
