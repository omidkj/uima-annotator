History of Present Illness:
70 year old woman who over the last six months has experienced
decline in exercise capacity, becoming short of breath while
performing her daily activities. In [**Month (only) 116**] she was admitted to
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital after becoming severely dyspneic, and
was found to have a RLL pneumonia. She was treated with [**Name (NI) **]
(unclear length of course),and required tap of the pleural
effusion. Her functional capacity was improved on discharge
however she noticed continued swelling of her ankles, dyspnea on
exertion, a non productive cough, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
and developed two pillow orthopnea. On [**2168-5-14**] she became
acutely dyspneic, presenting to the ED at [**Hospital3 **]
hospital, where she was started on supplemental 02, and admitted
for management of her dyspnea.  She was transferred for further
evaluation and treatment. Cadriac workup revealed Aortic
Stenosis, Mitral regurg, and coronary artery disease.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for surgical intervention.

Doppler.

Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results on [**2168-6-8**] at 1130am.

Postbypass

The post bypass exam was performed while the patient was
receiving 0.03 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine, 0.25 mcg/kg/min of
milrinone, 1.5 mcg/kg/min of phenylephrine. There is a
well-seated aortic valve bioprosthesis without paravalvular
regurgitation and without residual valvular stenosis. There is
well-seated mitral annuloplasty ring with mild residual
regurgitation. The mean gradient across the mitral valve is 4 mm
Hg. Overall ventricular function is preser
