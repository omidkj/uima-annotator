Admission Date:  [**2199-11-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2199-11-27**]


Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
gentleman with a history of diastolic congestive heart
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension,
and chronic renal insufficiency who presents from [**Hospital3 1761**] with respiratory distress.

The patient was in his usual state of health until one day
prior to admission when he was found with a respiratory rate
of 50, and bilateral rales, with an oxygen saturation of 84%.
He was tested for influenza A antigen and was found to be
positive.  At that time, he was started on rimantadine and
azithromycin.  The patient was also complaining of a sore
throat and malaise.

On the day of admission to [**Hospital1 188**], the patient's respiratory status worsened.  His
oxygen saturations decreased to 84% on room air and improved
to 96% with a 15-liter nonrebreather masks.  The patient was
transferred to the Emergency Department.  The patient has had
four prior admissions to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) 14169**] [**2199-8-28**]; once for respiratory failure secondary to congestive
heart failure and three for chronic constipation.

The patient had previously been living alone in an [**Hospital3 12272**] facility with [**Hospital6 407**].  He was sent
to [**Hospital3 **] due to increased unsteadiness on his
feet and increased forgetfulness.  At [**Hospital3 **],
he had been transferred to the Acute Care Division on
[**11-15**] for a urinary tract infection that was
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus positive.

En route for this admission, in the ambulance, the patient
was on 15 liters of oxygen with oxygen saturations of 96%.
He received 100 mg of intravenous Lasix and nitroglycerin
twice. In the Emergency Department, the patient received an
additional 40 mg of intravenous Lasix.  His blood pressure
was 180/80.  He was started on a nitroglycerin drip with
titration of his blood pressure to less than 120.  He was
also started on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure at 10 and
5.  He was given Tylenol.  A chest x-ray at that time showed
bilateral infiltrates and effusions bilaterally.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 60%,
with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and
2+ mitral regurgitation on an echocardiogram in [**2199-10-28**].  The patient had a normal stress test in [**2187**].
 2.  History of coronary artery disease.
 3.  Status post pacemaker placement (VVI) in [**2190**].
 4.  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
reactive airway disease with frequent episodes of bronchitis.
 5.  History of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia;
status post ablation.
 6.  Hypertension.
 7.  Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine
of approximately 1.7 to 2).
 8.  History of lower gastrointestinal bleed in [**2196**] with a
colonoscopy revealing polyps.
 9.  History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10.  History of glaucoma.
11.  Status post appendectomy and cholecystectomy.
12.  History of small-bowel obstruction and low anterior
resection twice.
13.  History of B12 deficiency.
14.  History of cataract surgery.
15.  Status post total hip replacement bilaterally.
16.  History of panic disorder.
17.  History of depression.

ALLERGIES:  The patient reports an allergy to PROSCAR (with
unknown effect), BENADRYL (with unknown effect), and
QUINIDINE (with unknown effect).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Rimantadine 100 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 3.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Lipitor 10 mg by mouth once per day.
 5.  Lopressor 40 mg by mouth twice per day.
 6.  Hydralazine 10 mg by mouth four times per day.
 7.  Atrovent and albuterol meter-dosed inhaler as needed.
 8.  Ranitidine 150 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Paxil 20 mg by mouth once per day.
10.  Colace 100 mg by mouth once per day.
11.  Isordil 20 mg by mouth once per day.
12.  Senna as needed.
13.  Vancomycin (since [**11-15**]) renally dosed for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus urinary tract
infection.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's vital
signs on admission revealed his temperature was 100.5 degrees
Fahrenheit, his blood pressure was 130/50, his heart rate was
65, his respiratory rate was 36, and his oxygen saturation
was 76% on room air and 95% on 100% nonrebreather.  The
patient had tachypnea and 4 to 10 seconds of apnea.  In
general, the patient was an elderly gentleman on [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure in no acute distress.  Neck
examination revealed jugular venous pressure at 9 cm.  There
was no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
a regular rate.  There was a 2/6 systolic murmur.  No rubs or
gallops.  Respiratory examination revealed bilateral rhonchi.
Crackles halfway up the bases (right greater than left).
There were intercostal retractions and abdominal breathing.
The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There
were positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
1+ edema bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Pertinent
laboratories on admission revealed the patient's white blood
cell count was 7, his hematocrit was 42.5, and his platelets
were 148.  The differential was normal.  Normal electrolytes
with a creatinine of 2.  Arterial blood gas at that time was
7.43/41/89 on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure at 10 and 5.
All blood cultures were negative.  Influenza test was
positive for influenza A.  Viral cultures were negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed a
ventricularly paced rhythm at 61.  No T waves.  No ST-T wave
changes.

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates and effusions.

IMPRESSION:  Our impression was that the patient was a
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of
diastolic congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who had influenza A causing a congestive
heart failure exacerbation, possible chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation, possible overlying pneumonia.
There was concern for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia as well as atypical nosocomial pneumonia
given the fact that he was staying in a rehabilitation
institution.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was weaned off [**Hospital1 **]-level
positive airway pressure and placed on nasal cannula.  The
patient was weaned down to 5 liters nasal cannula within
three days of admission.

The patient became very anxious on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway
pressure and was much more calm and breathing well on nasal
cannula.  The patient's saturations were maintained at 91% to
92%, and bicarbonate levels were monitored carefully given
his history of CO2 retention.

The patient was given Lasix 120 mg twice per day.  He was
diuresing well with at least one liter per day, which
improved his breathing greatly.  The patient was treated with
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers four times per day with
much relief.  He was treated with a 7-day course of
levofloxacin at 250 mg once per day as well as with
vancomycin renally dosed for a full 7-day course to cover for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia as well
as to complete the treatment of his history of a urinary
tract infection.

Incentive spirometry was encouraged, and chest x-rays
revealed almost complete resolution of effusions.  The
infiltrates persisted, but this was expected given the
short-time interval and should be followed up in the future
clinically.

For influenza A, the patient was continued on amantadine for
five days.  He was continued on droplet precautions.  On the
day of discharge this was discontinued due to the completion
of the course and the no longer infectious nature.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient has a history of
coronary artery disease.  He was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction.  The patient was continued on medical management
with aspirin, Lipitor, and Imdur (at their current
