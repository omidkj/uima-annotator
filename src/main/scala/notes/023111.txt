Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
man with a history of ventricular tachycardia, status post
ICD placement, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who
sustained head trauma in a motor vehicle accident in [**2169-7-28**] and had a resultant right-sided subdural hematoma.
His hematoma was initially followed by observation.  However,
he subsequently developed a left-sided hematoma.
Approximately one week prior to this admission, he had a
right-sided craniotomy and was discharged from that procedure
on [**2169-11-10**].  Over the next few days preceding this
admission, he began to notice some numbness in his left hand
and his family subsequently noticed a left-sided facial
droop.  He also noted that he was more clumsy and was
dropping objects when trying to use his left arm and he was
brought into the hospital by his family on [**2169-11-14**]
when they noted an increasing facial droop, slurred speech,
and drooling out of the left side of his mouth.

at age 84.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.3, heart rate 110, blood pressure 115/70, respiratory rate
20, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  General:  The patient
was in no acute distress.  HEENT:  The pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Anicteric sclerae.  Supple
neck.  Moist mucosal membranes.  The extraocular muscles were
intact.  Slight droop of the right eyelid and corner of the
right mouth.  There was 2-3 cm of JVD.  Cardiovascular:
Irregularly/irregular, tachycardia, faint systolic ejection
murmur at the left lower sternal border, radiating to the
apex.  Lungs:  Crackles at the bases, otherwise clear to
auscultation.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
obese.  Extremities:  Trace to 1+ peripheral edema.
Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact
bilaterally, strength 5/5 in all four extremities proximally
and distally, normal gait.  No finger-to-nose dysmetria.
Negative Romberg sign.  Biceps and quadriceps reflexes 2+
bilaterally.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 9.8,
hematocrit 35.6, platelets 388,000.  INR 1.2, PTT 29.2,
sodium 141, potassium 3.9, BUN 13, creatinine 1.0, glucose
106, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.9.

The EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, right bundle branch block, left axis deviation.

EEG showed mildly abnormal EEG due to bifrontal slowing and
then frequent right hemisphere or left frontal slowing
suggesting multifocal subcortical abnormalities.  However,
there were no areas of persistent slowing and no epileptiform
features.

Carotid studies showed minimal plaques with bilateral less
than 40% carotid stenosis.

Serial CAT scans of the head revealed stable appearance of
the right subdural hematoma and right frontal craniotomy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  LEFT FACIAL DROOP AND WEAKNESS:  The
patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical Service and
Neurology consult was obtained.  It was felt that the
patient's symptoms were likely due to local irritation from
the subdural hematoma and much less likely to be due to
stroke.  However, the patient subsequently underwent several
echocardiograms.  Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a
definite thrombus in the left atrial appendage along with
dilated right atrium and severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.  Therefore, it was felt that the patient's
symptoms may be due to TIAs resulting from small emboli from
his left atrial thrombus.

The patient was transferred to the Medicine Service and seen
by Cardiology in consultation.  It was felt that the  patient
will require anticoagulation for this left atrial thrombus in
preparation for eventual cardioversion.  However, due to his
recent subdural hematomas and craniotomy there was concern
that anticoagulation with an INR of [**1-30**] result in a
recrudescence of his subdural hematoma.  After multiple
serial CAT scans, the Neurosurgical Service thought that it
was safe to anticoagulate the patient to a goal INR of 1.5 to
1.8 with the hopes of increasing that INR goal to 2.0 within
two to three weeks if the subdural hematomas remain stable on
serial CAT scans.

The patient was started on Coumadin on the day of discharge.
His Coumadin dose was 4 mg and his INR was 1.4.  He will take
4 mg of Coumadin on [**2169-11-25**] and 3 mg of Coumadin on
[**2169-11-26**] and will have his INR checked on Monday,
[**2169-11-27**] and have this result called into his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who will adjust his Coumadin dose.

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient on admission was in
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response with a
heart rate ranging from 90s to 150s.  The patient had low
systolic blood pressures with his rapid ventricular rate with
systolic blood pressures in the mid 80s to mid 90s.  An
attempt was made to medically control his rapid ventricular
rate; however, the patient did not respond to increased
Amiodarone, digoxin, and increased beta blockers.  Therefore,
the Electrophysiology Service was consulted and the patient
underwent an AV junction ablation and his ICD was
reprogrammed to DDD.  His digoxin was discontinued.  He was
continued on his daily Amiodarone dose of 200 mg and he was
switched from Lopressor to Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.
The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in the Device
Clinic.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was maintained on
a beta blocker, statin, spironolactone, Lasix, and an
angiotensin receptor blocker.  He was instructed to weight
himself daily and to call his primary care physician if his
weight increased by more than 5 pounds as he would likely
need extra Lasix doses.  He also was instructed to maintain a
2 gram sodium diet and to try to restrict his fluid intake to
1.5 to 2 liters per day.

4.  ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  During the hospital stay, the
patient developed a mildly productive cough with right-sided
pleuritic chest pain and was found to have a  right lower
lobe aspiration pneumonia on his chest x-ray.  He was started
on a seven day course of Levaquin and Clindamycin which he
will complete as an outpatient.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with follow-up.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please have your INR checked on
Monday, [**2169-11-27**], and have the results called in to
