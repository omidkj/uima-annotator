Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

cardiac catheterization and angioplasty to SVG to LAD [**2134-2-5**]


History of Present Illness:
80M with CAD s/p CABG, PVD, DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia, CRI, GERD
who presented to ED with ~6 days of diarrhea. Pt was in his
usual state of good health & on vacation in [**State 108**] when the
diarrhea began on [**1-27**]. Describes diarrhea as loose, watery,
brown, no BRBPR, 3-5x/day. +Sweats (sometimes soaking through
clothes), subjective fevers, and "shakes" (lasting ~30 minutes)
occurring a few times per day since the diarrhea began. Does
remember eating lobsters, oysters, & other seafood at a buffet
the night before the diarrhea began, so he attributed it to
possibly eating undercooked or contaminated food. Unaware of
anyone else at restaurant or other friends/family becoming sick.
Tried immodium without any change in his diarrhea. Denies any
recent Abx use. Denies any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
Pt reports poor PO intake since diarrhea began but was able to
take flight back to [**Location (un) 86**] 3 days ago. Tonight, patient's family
was concerned about his continued symptoms, lightheadedness, and
dehydration so brought him to ED.


In the ED, initial VS HR 88, BP 82/48 -> 70/37, sat 96% RA so
started on IVF (rec'd total 6L in ED) with some improvement in
SBP to 85-100. Central line placed and CVP ~[**8-29**]. Lactate 2.1.
WBC 8.8 w/65N, 13bands.


Also in the ED, the patient developed epigastric burning and
then, separately, sudden-onset severe substernal chest pain with
radiation to his L-arm. Pt stated that the SSCP was similar to
his previous angina. Pt was lying in stretcher at that time and
receiving IVF for SBP in 80s. ECG was A-V paced and unchanged
from prior. Chest pain resolved after 1 mg morphine. Rec'd 325
mg ASA in ED.


On ROS, patient denies DOE, orthopnea, or urinary Sx. Reports
good excercise tolerance including walking many blocks and
biking 20 minutes per day at the gym. Denies any swimming while
in [**State 108**].


Past Medical History:

[**2134-2-2**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
