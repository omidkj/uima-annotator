[**2187-8-17**] 8:55 PM CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
IMPRESSION: Interval placement of right internal jugular line
and nasogastric tube. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
process.
.
[**2187-8-18**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes and global
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.

RECTOSIGMOID DONUT [**2187-8-22**] DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **]/nbh
DIAGNOSIS:
I.  Soft tissue, pelvic wall scar (A):

Keratinized squamous epithelium with focal active inflammation
consistent with colostomy stoma.
No tumor.

DISCHARGE LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
HD#1 POD #0 s/p explorator laparotomy with LOA, colostomy
takedown, LAR, loop ileostomy.  Operative findings included
multiple fistulae in the pelvis to the uterus.  Received 4500 CC
 of crystalloid during the operation, with 260 u/o.

HD#2 Unable to meet PACU criteria for transfer to floor due to
low urine output, not responding to 500c fluid bolus for low
urine output.  Attending notified, levophed was started,
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed, one unit of PRBC was transfused,
and the patient was transferred to the care of the SICU with a
CVP of 15-16

HD#3 Throughout the day the patient had her heart rate
maintained by use of lopressor, with levophed ordered to
maintain MAP > 65 with minimal O2 requirements.  Maintaining
appropriate urine output was obtained by provided IV hydration.
Evidence of good peripheral perfusion was evident.  The patient
had started to mobilize fluid and diurese much third-space
fluid.

HD#4 The patient's NG tube ouput was reduced, and the tube was
clamped.  Antibiotics were stopped, a central venous line was
placed, and the patient's oxygenation requirement was maintained
by 2 liters of O2, delivered by nasal cannula.  The patients
ostomy appliance had leaked into the midline wound; the wound
was cleaned in the OR, with a new ostomy appliace reseated.
The patient was weaned off levophed, and her labs improved
substantially.  Diuresis was assisted by two doses of lasix that
day.

HD#5 The patient had done well overnight, NG tube was d/c'ed.
Her pain was controlled by PCA.  She was transferred to the
floor, her diet was advanced to clears, and she was started on
her home lasix dose.  Her respiratory status improved
substantially, and she was tolerating Room Air appropriately.
PT evaluation was obtained for evaluation after her ICU course.

HD#6 The patient tolerated liquid diet on the floor, her wound
appeared erythematous with stable cellulitis, and she showed
excellent improvement otherwise, including increased ostomy
function  (amount + flatus).  PT assisted the patient in stair
training for dispo home.  Cefazolin was started for the stable
cellulitis

HD #7 The patient was able to void independently without
difficulty, the wound demonstrated decreased erythema on the
Cefazolin.  Ostomy nurse was on board to make sure the patient
had an improved device that would least hamper her home care.
She was able to tolerate oral pain medication without
difficulty.

HD #8 The patient had very minimal erythema of the wound area,
her operative drains were removed, and VNA services were set up
for her.  She was ambulating independently without difficulty,
and tolerating an appropriate diet.

HD #9 The patient was stable for discharge: PCP was informed
regarding the patient
s need for an INR check after her hospital stay, her wound was
treated with outpatient Keflex and dressing (Aquacel AG [**Hospital1 **]) per
wound care nursing.  Given her excellent improvement during her
hospital stay, she was discharged home with VNA services.
