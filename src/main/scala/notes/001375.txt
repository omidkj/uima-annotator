Pertinent Results:
[**2123-3-30**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Large left rectal sheath
hematoma with active extravasation possibly from a left anterior
epigastric artery

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: No acute intracranial process

03/23/11MRA BRAIN/NECK W&W/O CONTRAST : 1. Multiple bilateral
hyperacute infarcts involving the bilateral cerebellar
hemispheres, right pontomedullary junction, left occipital lobe,
and right posterior corona radiata. These findings are most
consistent with likely "shower" of emboli from a central source,
in this case, related to atrial fibrillation, with possible
additional thromboembolic propagation from aortic arch catheter
manipulation. 2. Abrupt, short-segment luminal narrowing of
proximal basilar artery and right superior cerebellar artery
origins, which may represent thrombo-embolic material or less
likely, dissection. This abnormality predisposes to posterior
circulation infarcts.
3. Diffuse bilateral foci of susceptibility, mismatched to
infarct locations. These most likely represent microhemorrhage
from hypertensive vasculopathy.  However, amyloid angiopathy,
nonocclusive thromboemboli, and Gelfoam/air embolization cannot
be completely excluded. 4. Mild non-flow-limiting stenoses of
bilateral vertebral artery origins. Multiple cerebellar
infarcts, basilar arterial narrowing

[**2123-4-1**] ECHO: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
left or right atrium or biatrial appendages. Preserved global
left ventricular systolic function. No clinically significant
valvular disease. There is a suggestion of a very small patent
foramen ovale. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

[**2123-4-3**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON & CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CO:1.
Rectus sheath hematoma appears slightly larger, but overall has
changed its distribution and appears to have tracked more
laterally than the prior examination. Extravasation cannot be
determined on this study, but there appears to be no obvious
pooling of contrast on late-phase images that were acquired. 2.
Mild stranding of the subcutaneous tissue extending from the
flanks to the left thigh is new from the most recent prior
examination. 3. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism;
however, smaller vessels were not well opacified due to
suboptimal contrast bolus and due to motion degradation. 4. Tiny
left-sided pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis noted. 5.
Area of alveolar infiltrate in the left lung base may be
infective. Right upper lobe area of infiltrate likely represents
scarring. 6. Nasogastric tube tip is proximal, at the distal
esopagus-gastric junction

[**2123-4-6**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): In comparison with the study of
[**4-5**], there are continued low lung volumes without evidence of
acute pneumonia, vascular congestion, or pleural effusion.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists. Feeding tube
again extends to the distal stomach.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was seen in the emergency department and was found
to have a large rectus sheath hematoma. CT indicated active
extravasation and the patient was taken to the IR suite for an
emergent embolization. At the initiation of the procedure, the
patient became tachycardic, hypotensive, and a code blue was
called. He was minimally responsive and required intubation. He
was found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and required
cardioversion to maintain his pressures. This was successful in
converting him to a normal rhythm and his emergent embolization
was continued. No active extravasation was demonstrated,
although a coil was placed in the superior epigastric and gel
foam in the inferior. Following the procedure the patient was
taken to the TSICU for further recovery. He was found to have a
dense left sided hemiparesis and the Neuro-Stroke team was
consulted. He was started on amiordarone for maintainence of his
normal sinus rhythm. CT and MRI head were obtained and these
showed multiple small cerebellar infarcts as well as a narrowed
basilar artery. On [**4-1**] the patient tolerated extubatio
