Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10682**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76M with history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, HTN,
COPD, DM2 presented to the ED with AMS, determined to have
hyperglycemia, stable brain mets and possible infection. On
discussion with patient's wife, Mr. [**Known lastname 32340**] health had been
stable until approximately 2 weeks prior to admission. On [**7-16**] weekend, patient had become confused, not remembering his
wife or children on a care ride from [**Doctor First Name 5256**] to
[**State 350**]. He had just been treated for cough with Levoquin
by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was taken to [**Hospital1 18**] and was shown to have
progressing brain mets. He was placed on Dexamethasone and
started whole brain XRT during that admission. Additionally, due
to concern of CAP, he was treated with 5-day course of Levaquin.
He was then discharged and completed his 5 day course of
Levaquin and subsequently his 5 dose whole brain XRT. He has had
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] of his mental status over the past 4-5 days,
with delay in his dexamethasone taper to continue at 5 mg TID
instead of going to [**Hospital1 **] dosing. This morning, Mr. [**Known lastname 16745**] was
noted to be walking around without his cane and turning on
lights around his house. Throughout the morning, he became more
confused and agitated, prompting his wife to bring him to the
[**Name (NI) **]. On review of symptoms, patient's wife states that he has had
some intermittant incontinence over the past week, subjective
chills (no temperature taken) and a "rattly cough" noted today
in the ED.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.0 P 128 BP 168/107 R 16 O2 sat.
96% RA. He was initially given Tylenol and Dexamethasone due to
thinking this was [**2-14**] his intracranial disease. He was then
given Ceftriaxone for possible infection, source unknown. UA was
negative for UTI. Blood glucose was elevated and he recieved
insulin subcutaneously. CT head was negative. CT abdomen and
pelvis was then done to evaluate for possible intra-abdominal
source of infection - this was negative for acute process. He
was extremely agitated in the ED, requiring haldol and zyprexa.
He was also restrained.

On the floor, initial vitals are 96.6 BP 144/91 HR 114 RR 34
O2sat 96% on 4L by NC. He is restrained, not agitated. Patient
is non-verbal.

Review of systems: unable to obtain as patient non-verbal


Past Medical History:
-Metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer
-CAD s/p CABG in [**2183**] with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein grafts to
a diagonal, circumflex marginal, and right PDA. EF 50-55%.
-Hypertension

Past Oncologic History:
The patient initially presented with dyspnea 0n [**2185-12-9**]. Chest
imaging revealed primary lung malignancy. PET CT showed
contralateral lymph node and bilateral SC node involvement as
well as innumerable bony lesions. Tissue biopsy was attempted
first by bronchoscopy but was aborted due to bleeding. FNA of
supraclavicular lymph node on [**12-13**] confirmed the diagnosis of
small cell carcinoma. He was transferred to the oncology
service, where he completed his first round of cisplatin &
etoposide chemotherapy. CSF cytology was
negative for malignancy x3, ruling out leptomeningeal
involvement. He is now Cycle 2, Day 20 of cisplatin/etoposide.
He is due to begin his next cycle of chemo on [**1-31**] at which
point cisplatin will be replaced with carboplatin [**2-14**] magnesium
wasting.

Social History:
He lives with his wife. Previously worked in maintenance. He has
a 100 pack year smoking history but quit about 10 years ago. No
alcohol or illicits.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. Father's side of family with CAD but all lived
to 80-90's. Mother's side died from stomach ulcers that became
cancerous (several members with same diagnosis). No other cancer
in family.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2186-7-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute hemorrhage or midline shift.
2. Multiple hyperdense foci consistent with known metastatic
disease and
better evaluated on MRI of [**2186-6-29**].
3. Prominence of the ventricles, similar in appearance to the
recent
examination of [**2186-7-18**], however, increased from CT of
[**2184-12-17**]. A component of hydrocephalus cannot be
excluded.

ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: I believe there is a hetergenous
density
appearance of the basisphenoid, which correlates with extensive
MR [**First Name (Titles) 16313**] [**Last Name (Titles) 32341**]s in that area, as seen on the [**2186-6-29**] study,
and is
consistent with metastatic tumor involvement.
There is prominent atherosclerotic calcification of the
cavernous internal carotid arteries.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2186-7-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1.Left hilar opacity corresponds with patient's known mass.
Markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm, left base opacity and
mediastinal shift to the left are likely due to left lower lobe
collapse.
2. Clear right lung.

CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2186-7-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Evaluation limited by lack of IV contrast.
2. Trace bilateral pleural effusions at the left lung base.
There is partial collapse of the left lower lobe, increased
since the previous study and incompletely imaged on this study.
Underlying infectious process is of concern.
3. Multiple hypodense lesions throughout the liver, consistent
with hepatic metastases. These are overall stable in size and
number since the previous study.
4. Diffuse osseous metastases as seen before and stable
compression fracture of L3 with mild retropulsion.
5. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

[**2186-7-30**] 1:35 pm BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCUS(COCCI).    IN CLUSTERS.

   Aerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2186-8-1**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO DR. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] ON [**2186-8-1**] AT 0025.
      GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN CLUSTERS.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old male with history of metastatic small cell lung
cancer, HTN, COPD presented with AMS, found to have bandemia,
left lung collapse, stable brain mets,  and positive blood
cultures.

# Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy:  This was likely secondary to
septicemia +/- hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in the setting
of known brain metastases s/p radiation therapy.

# Septicemia with GPCs in blood culture

# Hyperosmol
