Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, loss of appetite, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with 3VD (inoperable), ischemic CM, CHF (EF 15-25%),
severe MR, s/p VT ablation and ICD, CRI, PVD, CVA who presents
with several week h/o dyspnea and decreased PO intake.  The
dyspnea is not exacerbated with exertion.  He denies fever,
chills, though has occasional dry cough.  He has had no recent
known sick contacts and did receive his flu shot this year.  No
chest discomfort.  No palpitations.  Dyspnea has been
accompanied by generalized weakness and decreased PO intake,
with 5-6 pound weight loss over the past week.  He has had
difficulty sleeping for the past two nights, though denies PND.
No LE edema.

Mr. [**Known lastname 18034**] was recently hospitalized [**1-2**] -> [**1-11**] with
frequent episodes of VT.  Underwent VT ablation, and amiodarone
was restarted at 400mg.  Also noted to have ARF, which was
attributed to hypotension, and improved.

Recent clinic notes from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] detail similar
presentation of weakness.  He has had several medication changes
recently, including his amiodarone and digoxin dosing.  His
amiodarone was originally discontinued following recent VT
ablation,though was subsequently restarted at 800 mg daily.
Following reinitation, he noted weakness and blurred vision.
His amiodarone was again d/c'd [**2166-2-12**].  In addition, his
digoxin was d/c'd at 12/29, to see whether his symptoms improved
without it.  Per the patient's daughter, his symptoms initially
improved somewhat, though overall have not changed
significantly.

Per family members, he has been intermittently confused, and has
had bowel incontinence on several occasions.

ROS negative for HA, melena, BRBPR, abdominal pain.  Has had
intermittent nausea.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 74 yo M with ischemic CM, CHF with biV ppm, PVD, admitted
with dyspnea, weakness, decreased PO intake and ARF on CRI.

The pt was felt to be dehydrated d/t decreased po intake on
initial admission, which improved gradually. He was laced on
nesiritide and lasix per cardiolgoy given his CHF. The pt had a
history of afib, mural thrombus, and frequent Vtach. Coumadin
was held on admission given a high INR. Pacemarker was
interoogated showing intermittent complete heart block and high
grade AV block, changes attributed to amiodarone toxicity. His
pacemaker setting were changed. For his h/o CAD, continued
aspirin, b-blocker, statin. The pt had elevated LFT's and had a
RUQ US which showed no e/o liver or gallbladder pathology.

On [**2166-2-27**], the pt underwent cardiac arrest, whcih appeared to
be a PEA to asystole arrest due to failure of pacing capture.
Code labs revealed marked acidosis with elevated K. Hypotheses
included ischemic bowel from severe CHF, leading to lactic
acidosis, leading to pacer firing but not capturing. The pt was
hypotensive and was transiently on dobutamine and levophed. His
renal function worsened, felt secondary to shock. The pt's MS
was affected after the first code although he was noted to have
a lack of movement in his LUE; however, this might have been
from reexpression of previous strokes. EEG showed moderate
encephalopathy.

The pt was extubated on [**2166-3-2**]. He developed septic physiology
and was treated for an enterococcal UTI and for group B strep in
the blood with broad spectrum abx. His renal failure continued
to worsen. He was placed on milrinone with improvement in
cardiac index. He then had UGIB with episodes of melena and was
transfused. His LFT's rose significantly, felt to be c/w shock
liver. RUQ US showed no evidence of cholestasis. The pt's skin
was bright yellow/[**Location (un) 2452**], and was biopsied by dermatology (his
TBili was in the high 20's). The pt also had a coagulopathy from
unclear source, resolving with Vitamin K. The pt's MS began to
worsen, felt to be infectious/metabolic in origin. He then
developed a thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology.

The pt was medically stable but his MS did not return. He was
transferred to the cards floor. On [**2166-3-12**], the pt went into
respiratory arrest s/p possible aspiration event. He was
reintubated. His BP went to the 50's despite max doses of
levophed, dopamine, and milrinone. Epinephrine was started.

Code status was discussed at length with the pt's family
throughout the hospitalization. At this time, they agreed to
withdraw medical support and the patient passed away.
