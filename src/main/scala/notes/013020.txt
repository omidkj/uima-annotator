Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
C3-C4 spinal cord compression

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
C4 corpectomy with allograft and plate
intubation and mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old man, with a PMH significant for A. FIB
with RVR, Lower GI bleed 3 weeks prior to admission, severe lung
disease including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, believed to be
[**3-15**] rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, and COPD
admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2124-1-7**] after 1 day of
moderate shortness of breath and cough productive of yellow
sputum as well as two weeks of progressive difficulty walking.
He was treated for HAP with levofloxacin, pip/tazo, and
vancomycin. A blood culture was positive for Ecoli x 1,
sensitive to pip/tazo and ceftriaxone. He improved
symptomatically, and his antibiotics were narrowed to pip/tazo
alone for unclear reasons. His pulmonary status returned to
baseline by report, but then he went into atrial fibrillation
with RVR to the 180s. He was started on digoxin in addition to
his home dronaderone and diltiazem, and returned to sinus. While
working with PT in anticipation of discharge he was found to be
increasingly weak. He also complained of escalating neck pain. A
spinal MRI was obtained which showed severe c3-c4 spinal
compression with cord edema. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
Neurosurgical eval by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**].
.
On the floor here at [**Hospital1 **] he was comfortable on 4L NC, and by
report was at his baseline from a pulmonary standpoint. He was
taken to surgery the following day. His surgical course was
uncomplicated.
.
In the MICU he was intubated and sedated. He was transferred to
the MICU to remain intubated due to his underlying pulmonary
issues and concern from his pulmonologist that if he were
extubated too early and needed to be reintubate, it would be
very risky given his underlying spinal pathology. He was
extubated successfully on [**1-18**], but had difficulty swallowing
pills so speech and swallow was consulted. On [**1-19**] he converted
from normal sinus rhythm to Afib with rates in the 90s-100s, but
was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable.

Past Medical History:
- Extensive emphysema, especially of the upper lungs
- Asthma since childhood
- Rheumatoid arthritis (diagnosed [**2118**]; "rheumatoid lung" may
contribute to interstitial lung disease)
- Coronary artery disease, s/p large anterior wall MI [**2111-8-11**],
s/p BMS to LAD with ~50% restenosis noted in [**2122**]
- Sleep apnea - off CPAP
- UIP interstitial lung disease s/p wedge resections in [**2118**]
- Interstitial lung disease
- Chronic renal insufficiency (estimated GFR = 47 ml/min/1.73
m2)
- Ischemic cardiomyopathy
- Systolic CHF with LVEF of 35-40%, hypokinesis of the anterior
septum, anterior free wall,lateral wall and apex
- Pulmonary hypertension

- PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: AMI in [**2111**] and underwent
cardiac catheterization here where he subsequently had a stent
to his mid LAD.  He returned for cardiac catheterization on [**7-17**], [**2120**] where he was noted to have two-vessel CAD, mild MR,
moderate LV dysfunction, mild pulmonary HTN.  None of the
lesions was > than 50% so he was medically managed. Most recent
cath from [**2122**] showed ~50% restenosis of stent in LAD, but no
intervention undertaken.


Social History:
Lives with wife [**Name (NI) **] (she has not completed HCP [**Name (NI) 16353**], but pt
intends her to serve as his proxy). He has 4 children and 8
grandchildren. Semi-retired (this is his first semester out of
work) as a foreign language teacher, most recently at [**Hospital1 498**]
[**Location (un) 86**].
-Tobacco history: 30-40 pack-year history; quit 25 years ago
-ETOH: None recently


Family History:
Father died age 37 of "asthma" - family was later told that
studies done at [**Hospital3 **] showed evidence that he may have had
mild cystic fibrosis. Mother died age 59 of complications of
breast cancer including heart failure. One sister has breast
cancer, another sister has COPD, a living brother has a valve
replacement (patient does not know circumstances),
recently-deceased brother died of heart-related illness; he also
had RA. One daughter with [**Name2 (NI) **] (age 33), another daughter with
angioedema. Patient has been tested for genetics related to
hereditary angioedema but was negative.
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death.

IMAGING:
MRI C-spine [**2124-1-17**]:
Multilevel degenerative disc disease versus calcification of the
left aspect of the posterior longitudinal ligament, worse from
C3-C4 through C5-6, with severe spinal canal narrowing at C3-C4
and moderate spinal canal narrowing at C4-5 and C5-C6. There is
increased signal within the cervical cord at C3-C4, which may
represent cord edema versus myelomalacia. If differentiating
between disc disease and calcified ligament is of clinical
importance, cervical spine CT may be helpful.

CT C-spine [**2124-1-19**]:
1. No evidence of immediate hardware complication or change in
hardware
alignment since the radiographs done this AM, with persistent
angulation of
the anterior cervical bracket plate. Expected post-operative
changes including
marked edema and emphysema of the prevertebral and deep cervical
soft tissues.
2. C5-6: Residual marked spinal canal narrowing, largely due to
segmental
ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.
3. Multilevel neural foraminal narrowing with likely exiting
nerve root
impingement, unchanged from the pre-op MR study.

Speech/swallow exam [**2124-1-20**]: Penetration with thin liquid
consistency.
