tachycardia

History of Present Illness:
75-year-old woman with history of hypertension and multiple
myeloma, presents to ICU with tachycardia to 180s this AM in
setting of multiple refractory episodes of atrial fibrillation
with RVR earlier in hospital course.
.
Concerning her tachycardia, patient had no known history of
atrial fibrillation prior to this hospitalization, though has
been having episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR starting on
Friday [**2112-1-22**]. Cardiology consult was obtained on [**2112-1-27**]
due to ongoing paroxysms of RVR through the weekend that were
becoming difficult to control in setting of patient's mucositis.
Cardiology recommended increased frequency of IV metoprolol as
well as a TTE. Presumed atrial fibrillation with RVR to 180s
this morning which responded well to a push of 10 mg IV
diltiazem. Unfortunately, there is no telemetry record of this
event and no EKG was obtained. BMT team is reporting that
patient is becoming symptomatic during the tachycardia with
complaints of dyspnea. They additionally are concerned that her
mental status changes may be related to her tachycardia;
however, she has no documented hypotension.
.
Patient's original reason for admission to hospital was multiple
myeloma. Her MM was initially treated with Revlimid, stopped due
to question of some worsening of renal dysfunction. She was then
treated with Velcade and Decadron and had significant drop in
her paraprotein. Bone marrow on [**2111-11-30**] showed 60-70%
involvement and a follow-up marrow shows 3-5% marrow involvement
representing an excellent partial response. She presented to BMT
service on [**2112-1-18**] for autologous stem cell transplant and is
currently SCT day +6. her course in regards to her MM has been
complicated by a febrile neutropenia with urine culture positive
for VRE on [**2112-1-23**]. Patient being treated with daptomycin
given concern for linezolid causing cytopenias. Sensitivities to
daptomycin were requested on [**2112-1-26**] and are pending at this
time.
.
Patient has limited interaction with examiner, though denies
chest pain or pressure. Denies dyspnea. Notes mouth pain,
headache.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (per OMR note [**2111-5-11**], updated [**2111-12-18**]
based on OMR notes and history from pt):
Pt has history of multiple myeloma referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for an
opinion regarding myeloma therapy in the setting of renal
dysfunction by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4223**]. The patient states that she
has been told that she has been anemic over the last several
years. In [**11/2110**], she was noted to have further decrement of
her hemoglobin down to 9.7. Her CBC otherwise showed a white
count of 4.3 and platelet count of 238,000. At that time, her
creatinine was between 1.3 and 1.4. She was ultimately referred
for further evaluation to hematology and was found to have an
elevated immunoglobulin level with an IgG of 2638 and depression
of the IgA at 16 and IgM of less than 4. A bone marrow biopsy
was performed which showed 50% infiltration with IgG kappa
restricted plasma cells. UPEP showed modest amount of urine M
protein. Skeletal survey showed osteopenia without evidence of
focal lytic lesions and a kappa lambda ratio of free chain assay
was 22. The patient was started on Revlimid and Decadron. She
has had one and a half cycles. This was complicated by
escalation in her creatinine to 3.5. The patient ultimately
underwent a kidney biopsy that was suggestive of myeloma kidney
with evidence of light chain cast nephropathy and tubular
damage, some of which was felt to be subacute. The patient was
changed to a Velcade based regimen initially with her first
cycle receiving 75% of the dose in the setting of her renal
dysfunction along with dexamethasone. Although she is older than
typical transplant candidate, she received high cytoxan [**2111-12-18**]
in preparation for autogenic stem cell transplant.

Social History:

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2112-1-23**]: The central venous line inserted through the right
subclavian vein terminates at the mid SVC. There is interval
development of left basal opacity most likely consistent with
atelectasis with potentially present small amount of pleural
effusion. No focal consolidation is demonstrated to suggest
infectious process, although close monitoring of this area is
recommended. There is no evidence of volume overload. There is
no pneumothorax. There is no appreciable right pleural effusion
noted.
.
CT chest w/out Contrast [**2112-1-25**]:
1. Findings compatible with pulmonary edema likely related to
recent stem
cell transplant are new since prior exam. No definite evidence
of infection.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules, some of which are new.
.
Upper extremity U/S [**2112-1-26**]: No evidence of DVT
.
CT AB/PELVIS [**2112-1-30**]
1. Moderate right, and small left layering pleural effusions,
increased since the prior chest CT.
2. Relatively symmetric bilateral airspace opacities, perihilar
predominant, which may reflect infection or pulmonary edema,
worse since the prior study. Interlobular septal thickening at
the lung apices indicates pulmonary edema.
3. Small pericardial effusion.
4. Nonspecific mesenteric and perinephric stranding. While this
could relate to an infectious process such as pyelonephritis, or
pancreatitis, this may be related to a generalized anasarca.
Clinical correltion with urine analysis and pancreatic enzymes
is recommended.
5. Unchanged bony findings.
.
MRI [**1-29**]
Multiple small areas of elevated T2 signal within the white
matter of
