21, creatinine 1.1, glucose 73.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Medical Service and
had a head CT, which showed evidence of a high left frontal
parietal subdural hematoma.  Her neurological examination she
does have some problems with abulia, some psychomotor
slowing.  She has prominent retropulsion on attempt to stand
and she has marked difficulty initiating movement to walk.
This is likely reflects a gait apraxia, though it is
difficult to assess the primary motor, sensory modalities.
Her examinations suggests a bifrontal process and possibly a
left inferior and posterior process resulting a field cut.
Her head CT demonstrates a left frontal subdural hematoma
with 2.3 cm of frontal lobe compression with diffuse focal
effacement as well.  On [**2167-3-30**] the patient was taken to
the Operating Room and had evacuation of subdural hematoma on
the left side without intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the recovery
room and then in Intensive Care Unit.  She was awake, alert
and oriented times three, following some commands, but
slowly.  Strength was 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups.  She
did have a slight right drift and some slight weakness on the
right side.  She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
She continued to be monitored there.  She did have an episode
of having decreased mental status.  Therefore she had a
repeat head CT,which showed good evacuation of the subdural
hematoma with just air.  She spiked a temperature to 102.5.
She was on Kefzol for prophylaxis for the drain.  she also
had an MRI with defusion to rule out stroke.  This was done
and there was no evidence of stroke on the MRI scan.  She was
seen by cardiology and found to be stable from a cardiac
standpoint after surgery.  The patient did have a positive
urine for E-coli and she was started on Levofloxacin for
pneumonia and urinary tract infection.  She was transferred
to the floor on [**2167-4-6**].  She was continued to be followed
by cardiology.  She remained neurologically stable and
cardiac wise stable.  She has been followed by occupational
therapy and physical therapy and found to require a rehab.
She had a repeat head CT yesterday, which continues to show
good evacuation of the subdural hematoma, although her
neurological status waxed and waned.  She had episodes when
she becomes more abulic and not following commands, although
awake and alert and at other times is awake, alert and
following commands and moving everything.  She still
continues to have some right sided weakness.
