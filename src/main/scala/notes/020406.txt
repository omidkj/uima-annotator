CT HEAD:
1. Findings consistent with acute right MCA infarction and
thrombus in the proximal right middle cerebral artery.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage or masss effect

CTA:
1. Asymmetry of branching of right MCA artery, vessels otherwise
patent

Carotid duplex;
No carotid stenosis

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is moderate  symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is  normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
Right  ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta  is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. There are focal  calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral  regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic  hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was found to have a right MCA stroke (cardioembolic in
setting of stopping Coumadin for dental procedure) and was given
IV-tPA in the ER and admitted to the neurology service.  He was
registered at [**Hospital1 18**] at 0015.  Labs were drawn at 0025 and his
INR was 1.2.  CT scan at 0050 showed a dense rt mca, loss of the
insular ribbon and grey white junction elsewhere in the rtmca
territory.  Exam at that time was reported to show a NIHscale of
16 primarily due to left sided weakness, sensory deficit and
neglect.  He recieved a bolus of 8.2 mg IV tPA at 0135.  The
rest of the 73.6 mg was given as a drip.
He was admitted to the N-ICU for observation, neuro checks and
BP montioring.  Post-t-PA course was complicated by dental
bleeding (s/p extraction) which resolved spontaneously. He had a
CTA and rpt CT post IV t-[**MD Number(3) 24709**] showed patenet proximal Right
MCA with decreased MCA branching.  CT also showed petechial
hemorrhage within infarct.  He was started on aspirin [**11-8**].
Because of the small hemorrhage seen on follow up CT, his
Coumadin should be held for one week and restarted on [**11-15**].  He
should continue to take ASA until his INR is therapeutic.  Echo
showed no evidence of intracardiac thrombus.  Carotid duplex
showed patenet carotids.  His blood pressure was initially
controlled with labetalol drip which was converted to oral
metoprolol.  ACEI was added for improved BP control.  On [**11-9**]
he had an episode of rapid Afib which responded to diltiazem,
Metoprolol dose was increased for better rate control with good
results.  On [**11-9**] he was found to have a UTI and left LL PNA.
He was started on Levoquin and has remained afebrile.  He had a
video swallow evaluation on [**11-10**].  Diet recommendations for
pureed solids, nectar thick liquids.  Maintain aspiration
precautions, alternate between taking bites and sips.  He was
seen be PT and OT during his admission and was felt to be an
excellent candidate for rehab.  He is now being discharged to
acute rehab facility for continued care.
