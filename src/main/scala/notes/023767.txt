Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
c-scope and EGD [**2164-4-13**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 89417**] is a 22 year-old female with history of anxiety, s/p
recent rape (both vaginally and anally), which pt admitted to
multiple people was also with insertion of a baseball bat, with
subsequent pregnancy s/p abortion on [**4-7**] who presented to an OSH
with abdominal pain after the procedure. She went to went to
planned parenthood for the 2 day procedure; during second day
had desaturation to 78% and abdominal pain, and was sent to
[**Hospital1 **] for evaluation.  There she was found to have a Hct of
24 and SBPs in the 70's. She was also noted to have ?SVT to the
150's and was given metoprolol and adenosine and was eventually
electrically cardioverted to sinus rhythm. She was given 2 unit
PRBCs and 7 L IVF, and also got FFP. She underwent a CTA which
showed no PE and an abdominal CT with no hemorrhage. Prior to
this presentation in the OSH ED, she had been experience milder
abdominal pain for the past two weeks and had an episode of
BRBPR the day prior to presentation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she had SBPs in the 90s. She was given an
additional unit of PRBC, 2 units FFP, and rhogham. Gynecology
evaluated her and recommended starting zosyn and doxycycline.
She had a left IJ placed and was briefly on neo for pressure
support. On vaginal exam she was noted to have small clots.
Rectal showed trace guaiac stool. Of note she has recently
beeing taking large amounts of ibuprofen for pain. She was
started on an IV PPI.
.
She was initially in respiratory distress on arrival to the MICU
(thought to be due to flash pulmonary edema from the IVF) and
was given lasix. In the MICU her Hcts remained stable with no
further need for transfusion. Her acute anemia was thought to be
a combination of blood loss from her recent abortion and a slow
GI bleed possibly from NSAID-induced gastritis. She has had
significant anxiety and ?PTSD and psychiatry has been following
and making recommendations. She continues to have abdominal pain
and is on a dilaudid PCA. Social work is also following. GI was
consulted and are planning possible EGD/colonoscopy for Tuesday
(will likely need MAC) versus watchful waiting.
.
Additionally she had been placed on prednisone by her
pulmonologist (to be tapered). She was on 60 mg prior to
admission and has been tapered to 40 mg.
.
MICU attempted to call her out [**4-8**] but when the team evaluated
her she was found to have HR in the 150's with significant
anxiety. ? SVT. Sinus massage was attempted, but she was so
shaky, it was difficult to do. When she slowed down (when her
anxiety started to be controled), the rhythm looked like sinus
tach, not SVT, and she was kept in the ICU for 1 more night.
.
Patient continues to have abdominal pain, worst on the L, most
TTP over the CVA on the L. The abdominal pain has been requiring
a dilaudid PCA; ICU team felt she may have nonobstructive
nephrolithiasis vs an ovarian cyst but all imaging is with
contrast, so unclear.  GYN are following and does not think
there is any retained products but thinks may have had
endometritis so have continued course of abx, currently zosyn
and doxycycline.
 .
Upon transfer to the floor, patient is tearful and anxious, c/o
abdominal pain.
.

Imaging:
========
CXR: There is a left-sided IJ central venous catheter with the
distal lead tip at the cavoatrial junction. There has been
worsening of the airspace opacities bilaterally which causes
more opacification of the left retrocardiac area. Findings are
concerning for worsening pneumonia and/or aspiration.
.
Renal U/S:
1. No renal calculus identified; however, please note that CT is
more sensitive. No hydronephrosis.
2. Mild splenomegaly, small amount of ascites, suggestion of
splenorenal shunt and prominent splenic hilar vessels. Correlate
with any history of known liver disease/portal hypertension.
Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Pelvic U/S:
1. Enlarged uterus, compatible with recent TAB. Heterogeneously
echogenic material without internal vascularity in the
endometrial canal, most compatible with blood products. No
internal vascularity to definitively suggest presence of
retained products of conception.
2. Small free fluid.
3. Normal right ovary. Nonvisualization of the left ovary.
.
Repeat pelvic U/S:
Again seen, thickened, heterogeneous endometrium, measuring 2.7
cm in diameter, without internal vascularity.

1. Enlarged heterogeneous uterus, likely reflecting TAB one day
prior. However, there is a large amount of heterogeneous fluid
and debris within the endometrial canal. This may reflect
hematometra, though retained products of conception cannot be
excluded by CT and ultrasound is recommended for further
evaluation. Superinfection also cannot be excluded by CT
imaging, and clinical correlation is advised.
2. No free fluid or free air in t
