Saddle PE

IVC placement

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 174**] is a 33F with childhood NHL s/p XRT and chemo in
remission, meningioma status post resection 4 months [**Hospital **]
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] with saddle PE. Per the patient
and her mother, the patient had been having intermittent SOB and
congestion for a couple of weeks, though no complaints of chest
pain. Two days ago she was very somnolent and her parents noted
she was speaking less clearly. This morning the patient became
persistently short of breath and complained of a substernal
chest pain. She was taken to [**Hospital3 3583**] where she was found
to be 97.5 130 24 112/55 92% on ?L. The pt had a CTA showing
massive pulmonary emboli and RV strain. She was given 1L ns,
Lovenox 70mg and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the pt was found to have VS 97.5 120 90/62 20
90% RA. She had an EKG showing sinus tach, partial RBBB, TWI inf
ant/lat. Neurosurgery was consulted and felt it was safe to
anticoagulate but requested a baseline CT head which did not
show any bleed. Heparin gtt was started without bolus as Lovenox
dosing at OSH was subtherapeutic. Bilateral lenis were done with
DVT on R (non-occlusive).
.
On the floor, the pt was VS afebrile HR 120s, SBP in the 90s,
satting 99% on 3L. She denied CP, endorsed mild SOB but said she
felt improved from the am.
.

Past Medical History:
# Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: Her oncological problem began when she
was born. She was noted to have bruising in her skin. Initial
skin biopsy was inconclusive but later, at the age of 3 years
(in the [**2114**]'s), she developed an abdominal mass that was later
diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was treated with
chemotherapy and prophylactic whole brain cranial irradiation.
Her lymphoma was in remission since then. She was followed by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4468**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13534**] at the [**Hospital3 1810**] of [**Location (un) 86**]. When he
retired, she was lost to medical follow up. Of note, patient
received max dosing of Adriamycin as part of her chemotherapy.
# Basal cell carcinoma to scalp at radiation site status post
excision [**2144**] and [**2145**].
# Meningioma status post resection complicated by severe stroke
in the left pons. She left opthalmoplegia and right hemiparesis.

# Question neurogenic bladder versus urge incontinence now
treated with medication.
# Hypokalemia secondary to recent steroid use


Social History:
No tobacco use, previously drank alcohol socially.
She is now living at home with her parents,
[**Doctor First Name 717**] and [**Doctor First Name **] in [**Location (un) **].

Imaging:
[**10-29**] OSH CTA chest: massive pulmonary emboli. This includes
large saddle embolus, a portion which is folded in the left pulm
artery and a portion of which extends into and occlude the
descending R pulmonary artery. Multiple segmental pulmonary
emboli are seen in the R upper lobe and subsegmental pulmonary
emboli are seen through the left lung, especially at the base.
Evidence of R ventricular straing with dilatation of the
ventricle and bowing of the septum. Fatty infiltration of the
liver.
.
[**10-29**] CT head: no intracranial bleed
.
[**10-29**] LENIs:
1. + non-occlusive DVT of right superficial femoral vein with
reconstitution
at the level of the popliteal vein
2. no DVT in left lower extremity
.
TTE [**2145-10-29**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is "sparing" of the RV apex from systolic
dysfunction because of tethering to the LV, consistent with
acute pulmonary hypertension ("[**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign"). The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Dilated right ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction, most
c/w acute pulmonary hypertension. Preserved left ventricular
systolic function. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2145-7-6**], RV dilation and systolic dysfunction are
new. Findings relayed to the ordering team by phone at [**Pager number **]
hours on the day of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
33F with hx of NHL (at 3yo) s/p XRT in remission, radiation
induced Meningioma s/p resection [**6-16**] c/b L pontine stroke who
presents from OSH with complaints of CP and SOB, found to have
saddle PE and RLE DVT.
.
# Saddle PE: The pt presented with SOB and CP at outside
hospital and found to have saddle embolus. She was transfered to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management.  She had a new 2-3L O2
requirement, sinus tachycardia to the 110s-120s, and dilated
right ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction. However her
SBPs are stable in the 90s-100s and the pt is relatively
comfortable. Given her hemodynamic stability and her recent
brain surgery, she did not meet criteria for lytic therapy.
However, given her severe RV strain and RLE DVT, an IVC filter
was placed on [**2145-10-29**].  She was transferred to t
