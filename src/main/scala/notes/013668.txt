Notable studies:
.
# HIP (UNILAT 2 VIEW) W/PELVIS (1 VIEW)  [**2198-8-5**] 10:02 AM
AP view and lateral views of the right hip show an
intertrochanteric fracture of the base of the femoral neck with
approximately 7-mm separation. Degenerative changes are seen in
the left hip. Calcified fibroids are seen in the left side of
the pelvis. Degenerative changes are seen in the lower lumbar
spine.
IMPRESSION: Known fracture of the right hip.
.
# ECG Study Date of [**2198-8-9**]  3:46:40 AM
Irregular tachy-arrhythmia, probably atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response. Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities.
Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Since previous tracing of [**2198-8-8**] rapid tachy-arrhythmia and
further ST-T wave changes are now present.


Brief Hospital Course:
77F h/o HTN, CAD, angina, paroxysmal Afib, seizure disorder NOS,
mild dementia, transferred from OSH with R intertrochanteric hip
fracture and UTI, underwent [**Date Range 24785**] with lateral ST depressions on
intraoperative ECG, and transferred to MICU for closer
monitoring.  After stabilization, pt was transferred back to the
floor.
.
# Ischemia: Pt had h/o CAD and stable angina, with a recent
normal stress test.  Despite this, pt experienced intraoperative
[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions V4-6, 1 mm depression V3, < 1 mm depressions
I, aVL without reciprocal changes given demand ischemia.
Heparin was started in the OR.  After extubation, pt ruled out
for cardiac event, and heparin was therefore d/c'd.  On [**8-9**], pt
experienced Afib with RVR, along with diffuse ST depressions and
?STE @ aVR.  Because of negative cardiac enzymes, cardiology
consult recommended no acute intervention as inpatient.  TTE
revealed only RV strain, and pt was placed on recommended beta
blockade.  Given RV strain, LENIs and CTA were obtained to r/o
PE and were unremarkable.  Pt was administered enoxaparin, and
continued on aspirin, beta blocker, and nitroglycerin patch.  Pt
will f/u with outpt cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] at [**Hospital3 **]
(tel. [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11650**]) for outpatient stress test and f/u lipid
profile.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:  Prior to OR, patient received vitamin K
and 2units FFP with furosemide to reverse INR.  Pt experienced
pAF on [**8-9**], which was treated with metoprolol 10mg IV x1 and
standing metoprolol 50mg PO TID; pt converted to sinus rythym.
After [**Name (NI) 24785**], pt was restarted on home regimen of warfarin 1mg QHS
for pAfib with enoxaparin bridge.  Pt was continued on home
regimen of dofetilide with monitoring of QTc.
.
# CV output: Repeat TTE during this admission demonstrated
normal EF with RV strain concerning for PE, which was considered
less likely given negative CTA and LENIs.  Consider ACE for
afterload reduction.
.
# R hip fracture:  Pt underwent [**Name (NI) 24785**] on [**8-7**], which was c/b R
thigh hematoma and concomitant hematocrit drop WNL post-op for
hip [**Month/Year (2) 24785**].  Pt received PRBC with Hct improvement, and CT
abdomen/pelvis was negative for retroperitoneal bleed.  Pain was
managed with acetaminophen 1gm TID, as morphine IV led to
confusion.  Continue to trend Hct and maintain current pain
regimen.
.
#DVT prophylaxis: Patient is currently on lovenox 30mg SC BID
for DVT prophylaxis.  She will need to remain on Lovenox until
her INR is therapeutic at 2.0.
.
#INR-Per patient she has been taking Warfarin 3mg PO daily. her
outside hospital records report 10mg PO daily.  While
hospitalized the patient has been receiving warfarin 1mg PO
daily.  Her INR has been stable between 1.2 and 1.0 over the
past several days.  She will be discharged on Coumadin 5mg PO
daily, and her INR should be measured in two days.
.
# UTI: Ucx [**8-6**] demonstrated gram-positive bacteria suggesting
Staphylococcus, with repeat UA demonstrated mixed flora
indicating contamination.  Vancomycin was stopped on [**8-8**].
Ciprofloxacin was changed to ceftriaxone to avoid worsening QTc
in setting of pt's dofetilide regimen, and was d/c'd completely
on [**8-11**].
