History of Present Illness:
58 yo M w/ HCV cirrhosis, PUD, EtOH abuse, L frontal traumatic
hemmorhage who was brought from home by ambulance in setting of
suspected seizure, intubated in the field, now admitted to
further evaluation of his encephalopathy.
.
Pt. was in USOH until the evening PTA.  While in bed in the
middle of the night, noted by his wife to sit up, staring off
into space.  During this time was not responding to his wife.
She was able to lay him down, but then noted to look to the
right, move RUE up in the air and appear "stiff."  When wife and
son were unable to move him, EMS was called.  It is unclear from
wife's description and from EMS record how long the seizure
lasted.  Of note, per wife, over the past week has been c/o
intrmittent RUQ pain, persistent daily cough productive of white
sputum.  Wife notes that last drink was Thursday night.
.
EMS on arrival noted patient had a right gaze preference on on
evaluation and was not responsive to stimuli.  He was noted to
be anisocoric 4mm R and 2mm L and non-reactive.  Given 5mg of
ativan, 1mg lidocaine, 6mg of versed.  FS was 233. Reportedly
was mottled centrally. Intubated given respiratory compromise.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  142 22 113/72 99.2F intubated 100
% on unknown vent settings.  OG lavage produced 500cc of dark
brown material.  He received 4L NS, 80mg protonix IV and ppi
gtt, 1mgof folate, 500mg IV of thiamine.  Head CT showed Left
frontal encephalomalacia with ex vacuo changes.  Neurology was
c/s who recommended CTA neck, Keppra 1.5g load. Impression was
that pt. had sz from prior focus in setting of possible etOH
withdrawal.  EtOH lvl was 0 and serum/urine tox was neg.
.
On arrival to the MICU, intubated, 100.8F, 120/86, 77 100% on
22x550x50% FiO2.  Neurology evaluated pt and he was Keppra
loaded, now on 1g IV BID. Had LP which looked clean (HSV PCR
pending) so initial Abx and acyclovir were stopped. 24hrs of EEG
monitoring showed no evidence of seizures so this was
discontinued today. Pt has significant history of 18 beers/day
with reported last drink Thursday so have been monitoring for
alcohol withdrawal although difficult to tell what CIWA was
while intubated in unit.   He was extubated yesterday morning
and is doing okay from a pulmonary standpoint.  However, he has
been significantly delerious since extubation.  He hasn't
received any benzos since extubation and received last ativan
yesterday evening for sedation.  He had one elevated elevated
temperature to 100.8 on [**2-18**] but has been afebrile since
then. While in ICU, also had dark brown fluid through his OG
lavage and was started on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  Hct dropped after IV
fluids but has been stable in the last 24 hours
.
Overnight, the patient has no complaints.  He was still confused
and was not sure what exactly was going on.  He reported
breathing well. Reports history of alcohol withdrawal in the
past but didn't feel like he was anxious or withdrawing
overnight.
.
This morning, T- 98.0, BP- 120/60, HR- 74, RR- 18, SaO2- 96% on
RA.  The patient seemed more awake and oriented than overnight.
He reports feeling "groggy" but was oriented to person, year,
month, president.  He thought he was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 745**] [**Hospital 64552**] hospital,
not [**Hospital1 18**].  He was able to state the days of the week both
forward and backwards.
