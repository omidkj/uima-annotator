Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
N/V/diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, placement of femoral line

History of Present Illness:
72 yoF with h/o HIV(CD4 312, VL <50 [**2136-8-23**]),CHF(EF 10%), h/o
endocarditis, who p/w N/V and diarrhea for two days. Diarrhea is
watery, nonbloody. Vomitus is non-bloody. Also reports abdominal
pain.
In ED, patient reported fevers at home to 103. Denied recent
travel, dietary changes, chest pain. Did note mild HA.
.
In the ED, T 96.7, SBP in 80s. Patient's abdomen diffusely
tender and distended. Laboratory studies showed lactate 6.8,
transaminitis with INR 9.1, pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal
failure with hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. Patient
received vancomycin 1 gram, levo 750 mg, and falgyl 500 mg, as
well as 10 mg of vitamin K, 15 grams of kayexalate, 1 amp of
biarb, and calcium gluconate with insulin. She had a femoral CVL
placed and was volume resuscitated but rapidly developed SOB. By
report from ED resident, long discussion with patient held and
patient voiced desire to be DNR but would like to be intubated
and dialyzed. Patient was then intubated and volume
resuscitation continued. Was also briefly placed on levophed for
hypotension which was quickly weaned off. She received a CT of
the abdomen/pelvis which showed some concern for ischemic
changes. Surgery evaluated patient and did not feel there was
any acute indication for surgery. Renal was also consulted and
felt that she did not need emergent dialysis.
.
Of note, recent admit [**Date range (1) 105349**] after presenting with
bradycardia and treated for digoxin and amiodarone toxicity,
acute on CRI, and CHF. Amiodarone stopped (had been started
during prior hospitalization due to runs of Vtach. Also started
on coumadin given severely depressed EF. [**Date range (1) 2775**] therapy was also
discontinued which was verified with her PCP.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-8-30**] 9:32 PM
1. Linear focus of air within the left renal vein. Approximate
volume is 0.7 cubic centimeters. This is of unclear clinical
significance, but likely relates to injected air from IV
placement or medication administration.

2. Diffuse stranding of the mesentery and abdominal ascites.
Please note, lack of intravenous contrast administration limits
detailed evaluation of the intra-abdominal and pelvic organs.

3. Non-obstructive left upper pole renal calculus.

4. Nasogastric tube should be advanced at least 5 cm for optimal
placement.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2136-8-31**] 12:41 AM
IMPRESSION: Limited examination secondary to patient motion. No
acute intracranial hemorrhage.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2136-8-3**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. LA volume markedly
increased.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. The
patient is
mechanically ventilated. Cannot assess RA pressure.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity. Severe
global LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Sever
