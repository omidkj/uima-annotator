History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 10827**] [**Known lastname 54591**] is a 53 yo woman found unresponsive this AM by a
friend.  [**Name (NI) **] the doumentation, the patient was found sitting on
a couch unresponsive, vomitus in her mouth.  She was cold to

Physical Exam:
Discharge Exam:

normal including blood pressures typically 110s - 120s. Regular
heart rate in 70s.
She continues to produce some secretions from her trach.
Transmitted upper airway sounds. Regular heart, no murmurs. Soft
abdomen.
Opens eyes to voice at times, or touch. When drowsy in early
a.m. may take a while to awaken and sometimes has disconjugate
gaze if on the verge of sleep. Comprehension limited at best,
occasionally following simple commands with left hand in
Spanish, although this is infrequent. No attempts to speak or
mouth words. Tone normal throughout. Right arm is paretic.
Localizes pain on right leg (with left foot), but does not move
spontaneously. Spontaneous antigravity movements of left arm and
leg. Reflexes symmetric. Upgoing right great toe.

Cardiac: regular rate, No murmurs appreciated.
Abdomen: soft, normoactive bowel sounds
Extremities:  well perfused

Neurologic:
Intubated, propofol off. Does not respond to commands, does not
open eyes.  Pupils minimally reactive, + corneals, more brisk on
left.  Eyes slightly dysconjugate with right eye deviated out.
+
Cough to deep suctioning. Right arm and leg with brisk reflexes
and right toe upgoing.  Withdraws to noxious stimulation in the
legs.  Has extensor posturing of the left arm, turns into
stimulus on right arm.  Left sided reflexes are less compared to

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant interval change in the right frontal
parenchymal hemorrhage and intraventricular extension of bleed.

2. Stable ventricular size, with interval placement of left
transfrontal
ventriculostomy catheter in satisfactory position.
3. Evolving extensive left cerebral hemispheric infarcts,
without evidence of hemorrhagic conversion.

CXR [**2-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Slightly increased vascular engorgement and
cardiomegaly with
improved right lower lung aeration.

Cerebral angio [**2-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 70-79% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery.

CT Head [**2175-2-25**]
A large right frontal parenchymal hematoma is again noted,
measuring approximately 42 x 23 mm (2, 9) similar in size
compared to [**2175-2-23**], previously 23 x 43 mm. A small
amount of blood continues to layer in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral ventricle, but appears slightly decreased compared
to the most recent prior examination. The ventricles remain
mildly dilated, but unchanged compared to [**2175-2-23**]. An
8-mm leftward shift of normally midline structures with
subfalcine herniation is mildly decreased compared to [**2175-2-23**], previously 10 mm leftward shift. Hypodensities in the left
frontal, parietal and occipital lobes are again noted,
relatively stable. Partial opacification of mastoid air cells is
once again noted.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in ventricle size compared to
the most recent prior examination. Otherwise, layering blood
within the left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] is slightly decreased compared to
the most recent prior examination. Otherwise, no significant
interval change since [**2175-2-23**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage, Ischemic Stroke and Obstructive
Hydrocephalus:
  Patient [**Name (NI) 54591**] was admitted to the ICU as a transfer from
[**Hospital3 **] after being found down at her home
unresponsive, intubated on the field and found to have on
subsequent CT a large right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage
with intraventricular extension. She had an EVD placed in the ED
and was taken to the ICU for further care. Over the course of
her ICU stay she was intubated and started on Keppra
prophylactically with IV agents for blood pressure control as
her pressures were difficult to control (goal was less then 160)
- for her final regimen see medications below. Before her
arrival she was a known cocaine abuser and beta blockers were
avoided. She had a CT with vessel imaging that demonstrated
significant stenosis in the left ICA. This
