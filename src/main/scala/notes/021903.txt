Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
.
In the ED, vitals T96.5, HR 30, BP 101/60, R16, 100% RA. HR from
high 20s to 40s in ED with SBPs 90s-117. Labs verified
previously noted abnls - Na 122, K 6.5, creat 2.5. CXR with RLL
pneumonia vs. pneumonitis. CT abd without contrast performed -
mod fecal load, gastric distension, thick bladder - infection
vs. decompression. Received ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for
pneumonia and ?cystitis. Also given 60 kayexalate, D50 plus
insulin, 1L NS. Renal aware.
.
MICU COURSE:
Upon arrival to MICU, patient awake but confused. Brady to
20s-30s, then had clear 9 sec asystolic pause and period of
unresponsiveness which resolved spontaneously. DNR/DNI status
confirmed with HCP. SBPs in 100s initially, then down to 70s
systolic. T was 94 axillary and 97 rectally. Aline placed,
confirming SBP in 70s. Dopamine started peripherally with
improvement in rates and BPs. Dopamine was discontinued after 18
hours. Hypotension resolved with pressor and remained stable
afterwards. Nephrology was consulted and considered etiology was
likely ATN secondary to hypotension/NSAID/sepsis. CXR revealed
pna, with cultures unremarkable so far. Was started empirically
on meropenem and vancomycin for HCAP with history of ESBL.
Metronidazole was started but discontinued when C. diff toxin
came back negative. After discussion among patient, family, PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] MICU team, code status was changed from full to DNR but OK
to intubate.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST [**2130-5-11**]:
FINDINGS:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
In the visualized thorax there are bilateral effusions and
associated atelectasis. Patchy consolidative opacties may
represent pneumonitis from
infection or aspiration. There is aortic valve calcification.
There is
calcification of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
The heart is enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion.
In the abdomen, evaluation of the solid organs is limited
without intravenous contrast. The liver, gallbladder, adrenals,
kidneys, and pancreas appear normal. The spleen appears small.
There is gastric dilatation. Otherwise, bowel loops are normal
in terms of caliber with no free air, free fluid, or pathologic
lymphadenopathy shown. There is fecal loading that involves the
ascending and transverse colon. The abdominal aorta is calcified
including the origins of the celiac axis and SMA.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
The rectum, sigmoid appear normal. The patient is status post
hysterectomy. The bladder is deflated, but there is mild wall
thickening which may be due to underdistension. There is no
pelvic free air, free fluid, or pathologic lymphadenopathy.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or
osteoblastic lesion,
although severe degenerative changes at numerous levels of the
spine including Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.
IMPRESSION:
1. Patchy bibasal pulmonary opacities may represent pneumonitis
with
infectious and/or aspiration etiologies.
2. Bladder wall thickening likely due to underdistension,
however cystitis
not excluded. Correlate with UA.
3. Cardiomegaly

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   [**2130-5-15**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**5-11**] through 12.
Left lower lobe, collapsed on [**5-11**] has grown progressively
more consolidated, probably atelectasis again, now accompanied
by increasing small  to moderate left pleural effusion. Small
right pleural effusion is new since [**5-13**], stable since [**5-14**]. Mild cardiomegaly unchanged. Upper lungs show mild vascular
congestion, otherwise clear. Nasogastric tube is looped several
times in the stomach. No pneumothorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
86 year-old female with known asymptomatic sinus bradycardia,
HTN; admit to MICU with ARF, hyperkalemia, pneumonia, and
worsened bradycardia; briefly asystolic and hypotensive; now
stablilizing on antibiotics.

# Hypotension: She was briefly hypotensive to SBP in the 90s in
the ED when her ventricular rate fell to the 20s.  There was
concern for septic shock and she was therefore treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids.  She was
also briefly on dopamine.  Her blood pressure normalized within
the first 24 hours of admission.  There was initially no
localizing source of infection on exam, but a CXR was concerning
for RLL pneumonia.  She was started on vancomycin and meropenem
because of her history of ESBL UTI.  She remained afebrile
throughout her stay however but she clinically she had no
evidence of pneumonia, as she was afebrile and without a cough.
However, antibiotics were continued for a short 10 day course of
linezolid and cefpodoxime/levofloxacin for MRSA and gram
negative double coverage.  Blood cultures were negative but a
urine culture taken at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] prior to admission grew E.
coli (50,000 Colonies) sensitive to ampicillin and
cephalosporins but resistant to bactrim and ciprofloxacin.  It
was unclear whether her presenting symptoms were secondary to
her UTI or her UTI was secondary to another infectious process,
such as pneumonia, but empiric management was continued as
described above.  She was also started on a short taper of
high-dose hydrocortisone and transitioned to po prednisone at
the time of discharge.

# Pneumonia/Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  She had acute
respiratory acidosis with inadequate metabolic compensation at
the time of presentation.  This was thought to be secondary to
respiratory depression in the setting of altered mental status
and infection.  Her hypoxia (O2 sat of 80s on room
