Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI and possible Aortic Dissection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with placement of 2 bare-metal stents to
PDA

History of Present Illness:
78 yo F w/ s/p CABG in [**2178**] w/ 2 vision stents, who initially
presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**11-1**] by ambulance with
generalized weakness, worse on the left side. EMTs noted slight
facial droop on the L side w/ weakend L sided grip and left arm
drifting. CT Scan showed no evidence of an acute process. At the
OSH, her TropI were 0.02 --> 0.04 --> 0.49 and with the next
series 2.55, 7.59, 11.85. Last troponin at 0945 on [**11-2**] 15.52.
She received morphine, lovenox, plavix and aspirin and it was
decided that she should be transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
She developed scapular pain, along with an oxygen requirement
and had a widened pulse pressure, so there was concern for
aortic dissection. Upon transfer she went for CTA to rule out
aortic dissection, which showed some evidence of LLL
consolidation, and was given 1 dose vanc/cefepime empirically.
She was also found to have ST elevations on EKG in leads III and
AVF and went to the cath lab for evaluation. Of note, she has
been off of her aspirin and plavix due to recent carpal tunnel
release on [**2194-10-30**].
.
In the cath lab, 100% occlusion of the PDA was seen and 2 BMS
were placed in the vein graft in the PDA. The last hour of the
procedure, pt was complaining of lower back pain (chronic) and
was in a lot of discomfort. She was given fentanyl and versed,
and became hypoxic to mid 80s (down from 94% at presention to
cath lab). She became hypotensive and it was noted that she was
in a.fib with RVR. Lopressor 2.5mg IV and amiodarone 150mg IV
were administered, and then pt was cardioverted with DCC (200J),
which restored her to sinus rhythm. She received a total of
100mg fentanyl and 2mg versed. The swan and venous sheath remain
in place. The arterial sheath has been removed. She came up to
the floor on dopamine drip and integrilin and was placed on a
hi-flow neb mask, with O2 sats 88-92%.

IMAGING
[**2194-11-2**] CARDIAC CATH:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
angiographically-free of flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD was
diffusely diseased proximally and mid with serial focal lesions
of 50% proximal and 70% x 2 mid lesions (just beyond the
take-off of the small diagonal and septal branches).  It filled
antegrade with TIMI 3 flow.  No retrograde LIMA
filling/competitive flow noted.  The LCx was known to be
chronically occluded, with faint filling of tiny vessels noted
via L -> L collaterals. The RCA was not selectively engaged
since it is known to be occluded.
2. Selective vein graft angiography demonstrated a proximal
total
occlusion of the SVG-RCA graft.  A stenotic lesion proximally
was noted
to be followed by a thrombosis of the graft segment beyond the
stents.
The SVG-Diag was patent.  The SVG-OM was occluded as was
previously
known.
3. Selective arterial conduit angiography demonstrated an
atretic LIMA->
LAD.
4. The patient was complaining of lower back pain (chronic) at
the
conclusion of the left heart catherization, and was in a great
deal of
discomfort.  She was given more Versed and Fentanyl, and became
hypoxic
to the mid-80s (down from 94% at presentation to the cath lab)
on 100%
NRB.  She also became hypotensive; rhythm soon after noted to be

atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Lopressor 2.5 mg IV and
Amiodarone 150 mg
IV were administered followed by DCCV at 200 J, which restored
NSR.
5. Resting hemodynamics during hypotension while patient was in
atrial
fibrillation revealed mildly elevated right-sided filling
pressures with
a RVEDP of 11 mmHg, and moderately elevated left-sided filling
pressures
with a PCWP of 19 mmHg.  Her cardiac index was reduced in the
setting of
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (using an
assumed O2
consumption). There was also low-normal systemic systolic
arterial pressures noted at the start of her catherization, with
central
aortic pressure of 101/46, mean 68 mmHg.
