Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with BMS to RCA

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1137**] is a 69 y/o male with a history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia who presented to his PCP's office with
chest pain since Saturday. Pt has no history of CAD or angina.
He reports starting two days prior to admission he developed
heartburn which was not relieved with OTC antacids so he made a
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 648**]. He denied any worsening with position, activity
or associated nausea,vomiting, diaphoresis, shortness of breath,
lightheadedness.  He reports it felt like his last episode of
acid reflux so made the PCP appointment to get a prescription
medication for it.  At his PCP's office he was found to have ST
elevations in II and III and was taken by ambulance to the ED.
In the ED repeat EKG showed Q waves already present with some ST
elevation in II and III, his troponin was elevated at 1.39 and
his Cr was 0.9. He had received a full dose aspirin at his PCPs
office and was placed on a heparin drip in the ED and taken to
the cath lab from there. In the cath lab, he received prasugril
and bivalirudin and underwent left heart cath via the right
femoral artery and was found to have total occlusion of the RCA,
and he had a BMS placed in it.  He was to be transferred to the
[**Hospital1 1516**] service, however he was noted to be in 2nd degree heart
block on post intervention EKG, so he was admitted to the CCU.
He denies any history of cardiac problems or arrythmia in the
past. His brother had a history of rheumatic heart disease but
he had no problems.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient has no complaints and reports
feeling well.

STUDIES:
[**2110-6-16**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Mild vascular prominence which could be seen with pulmonary
venous hypertension or slight congestion.

[**2110-6-16**] CARDIAC CATH:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA is
normal.
The LAD and LCx are without obstructive disease.  The RCA was
totally
occluded in the mid vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure with central aortic pressure 134/68 with a mean of 81
mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.

[**2110-6-17**] ECHO:
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler. Normal IVC diameter (<=2.1cm) with >50% decrease
with sniff (estimated RA pressure (0-5 mmHg).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT
gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior,
inferolateral and inferoseptal segments and hypokinesis of the
rest of the inferior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40%). There is some echogenicity of the basal
inferior/inferolateral endocardium, consistent with myocardial
edema. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular dysfunction, c/w
recent inferoposterior infarction. Mild mitral regurgitation. No
echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular infarction or
mechanical complications of LV infarction.

[**2110-6-17**] VASCULAR ULTRASOUND RIGHT GROIN:
Right femoral vein and artery demonstrate appropriate waveforms
and are
patent.  There is a 1.7 x 1.3 cm partially thrombosed saccular
pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral artery with
a [**Location (un) 45918**] measuring approximately 6 mm.  There is no evidence
of AV fistula.
