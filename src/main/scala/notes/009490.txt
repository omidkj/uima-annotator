Admission Date:  [**2136-1-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2136-1-16**]


Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was transferred from an outside
hospital for management of acute ST elevation myocardial
infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is an 84-year-old
woman without significant past medical history whose only
cardiac risk factor was her age.  She was transferred from
[**Hospital3 3583**] where she presented the morning of admission
with chest pain radiating to her jaw.  At [**Hospital3 3583**] she
was found to have ST elevations anteriorly and inferiorly.
She was started on aspirin, give a beta blocker and started
on a heparin drip and transferred immediately to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.

In retrospect the patient recalls experiencing chest
tightness with exertion for approximately two weeks prior to
admission, as well as chest tightness over the two days prior
to admission even at times of rest.  She denies any other
complaints.

The patient was taken immediately to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory upon arrival before coming to the
coronary care unit.  There she was found to have a right
dominant system with two-vessel coronary artery disease.  The
left main coronary artery had a 30% ostial lesion.  The left
anterior descending artery was occluded proximally with fresh
thrombus.  The left circumflex had mild luminal
irregularities.  There was a medium-sized ramus intermedius
with a 90% proximal lesion.  The right coronary artery was
diffusely diseased with 50% proximal stenosis and then was
occluded at the midportion.  The distal right coronary artery
was reconstituted with right-to-right collaterals with TIMI 1
flow.  There was successful percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stenting of the proximal to mid left
anterior descending coronary artery, as well as thrombectomy
with a final result of TIMI 3 flow.  Right heart
catheterization was done as well showing elevated pressures
with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 32, a mean right
atrial pressure of 22 mmHg.  PA pressure was 56/25.  The
cardiac index was depressed at 1.5.  Following
catheterization the patient was transferred to the coronary
care unit for further monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Anxiety.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Buspar and Remeron.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies use of tobacco or
alcohol.  She lives in [**Location 3320**] independently.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to the coronary care unit
the patient was afebrile, heart rate was 77, blood pressure
103/56, oxygen saturation was 97% on four liters, respiratory
rate 17.  PA pressure at that time was 33/14.  Pertinent
physical findings reveal that her sclerae were anicteric.
Her oropharynx was clear and dry.  Examination of the neck
revealed jugular venous distension to the earlobes
bilaterally.  Her lungs had crackles at the left base but
were otherwise clear.  Her abdomen was obese, soft and
nontender.  Her heart examination revealed a normal S1 and
S2, no murmurs were heard.  Extremity examination revealed
decreased distal pulses bilaterally, no edema, and the
patient had significant hematoma at the right groin.  The
patient had had an Angio-Seal placed which temporarily became
unseated after the case as the patient was a bit agitated.
The hematoma was stable after compression held in the
catheterization laboratory and was not found to be enlarging
on examination.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Chem-7 was unremarkable.  Initial set of
cardiac enzymes revealed a CK of 817 with an MB fraction of
53.  Troponin was 8.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Cardiovascular:
A. Coronary artery disease:  The patient was status post
anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction.  She was
continued on aspirin after the procedure as well as
Integrilin for 18 hours post catheterization.  She was
started on Plavix to be continued for 30 days.  Immediately
post catheterization because of her depressed cardiac output
and index, her beta blocker and ACE inhibitors were held.
Eventually as her hemodynamics improved and her blood
pressure tolerated, she was restarted on beta blocker,
initially Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.  The patient was called
out of the coronary care unit to the medical floor on the
next hospital day, [**2136-1-11**] after the Swan-Ganz catheter had
been discontinued.  Her lipid panel was checked showing that
she had an LDL of 90 and HDL of 58.  With these numbers the
patient was not started on a statin.  Her beta blocker was
titrated to 25 mg b.i.d. and was well tolerated.

B. Rhythm:  The patient was in sinus rhythm throughout her
hospitalization.  On hospital day number to she was found to
have an 11-beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
Electrophysiology was consulted regarding risk stratification
in this woman peri-MI.  It was felt that because of her very
low ejection fraction and evidence for a large area of
scarring by EKG that she should undergo risk stratification
for arrhythmia, however it was felt that given that she had
just completed an acute anterior myocardial infarction, it
was felt that invasive electrophysiologic studies should be
performed approximately one month after this admission.  For
that the patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**]
approximately one month after discharge.

C. Congestive heart failure:  The patient had an
echocardiogram on [**2136-1-11**] revealing an ejection fraction of
less than 25%.  The left atrium was mildly dilated.  There
was symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There was severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis with some preservation of
the basal lateral and basal posterior wall segments.  Overall
however the left ventricular systolic function was severely
depressed.  On [**2136-1-11**] while being transfused for an
hematocrit of 27.2, the patient experienced some shortness of
breath and clinical findings suggestive of congestive heart
failure.  She was diuresed with Lasix with improvement.
Because of her poor ejection fraction and anterior myocardial
infarction the patient was anticoagulated initially with a
heparin drip and Coumadin was begun.  Ultimately she was
changed to Lovenox at the time of discharge until her
warfarin with therapeutic.  Also for her heart failure the
patient was placed on lisinopril 2.5 mg to be titrated as her
blood pressure tolerated.

2. Psychiatry:  The patient was continued on her outpatient
doses of Remeron and buspirone.

3. Urinary tract infection:  Her urinalysis was checked on
the evening of [**2137-1-10**] suggestive of urinary tract infection
with leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 white blood cells,
and many bacteria.  The patient was treated with
ciprofloxacin for three days.

DISPOSITION:  Prior to discharge physical therapy was
consulted.  It was felt that the patient did not require
inpatient rehabilitation but that she would benefit from home
physical therapy and VNA, and the patient was discharged to
home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction status
post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and
stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery.
2. Anxiety.
3. Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous q. 12.
2. Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
5. Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Metoprolol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Remeron 7.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
9. Buspar 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was to have a PT/INR drawn by the VNA
services on [**2136-1-17**].  The patient was to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**] four weeks following decision to be
arranged by her office.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
