HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old
female with a history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension,
tobacco use, with question of history of myocardial
infarction.  The last cardiac echocardiogram was done in
[**2185-9-11**] and it was reported to have a normal ejection
fraction with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation.  The
patient had recently undergone a total hip replacement on
[**2185-9-9**] and she was at rehabilitation subsequently
when she started to develop some worsening congestive heart
failure symptoms including increased dyspnea on exertion.
She was scheduled for cystoscopic examination to evaluation
bladder dysfunction at the [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **].  The
urologist was Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 43125**].  On an EKG, she was noted to
have ST depressions in the anterior leads, finding that was
new compared to her EKGs from [**2185-9-6**].  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**10-14**] for cardiac catheterization and a question of
some ischemia.

In the cardiac catheterization laboratory at [**Hospital1 346**], she was noted to have severely
elevated left sided filling pressures with several pulmonary
hypertension.  PA systolic pressure was 83.  PA diastolic
pressure was 40.  Wedge pressure was 42.  Cardiac output was
4.4.  Cardiac index was 2.2.  The PVR was normal.

During the catheterization, the patient went into flash
pulmonary edema as the systolic blood pressure became over
200.  She desaturated to about 61% with the PACO2 of 67 mmHg.
She improved with nitroglycerin gtt, Fentanyl, and Lasix 20mg
IV, then 40 mg IV.  Catheterization was also notable for a
preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.  She had clean
coronaries, left via RCA ostial 50%, otherwise, the left main
was normal.  LAD was normal.  Left circumflex was normal.

Following the catheterization and the IV Lasix, the patient
was transferred to the coronary care unit for continued IV
diuresis and blood pressure control.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
the patient's temperature upon arrival to the coronary care
unit was 98.5.  Heart rate ranged between 70 and 80.  Blood
pressure was 109 to 41.  She was saturating 97% on 5 liters
and the respiratory rate was 24 to 32.  In general, she had
no chest pain.  She was breathing comfortably in no apparent
distress.  Eyes were anicteric.  Pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Moist mucous membranes.  Oropharynx was
without lesion.  JVP was .....................  She had no
carotid bruits and 2+ carotid pulses.  She had a regular rate
and rhythm.  She had a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur that
radiated to the apex and she had a positive S3.  She had
crackles diffusely half way up, both lung fields.  She had no
wheezes.  Abdominal examination was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  She had 2+ pitting edema up to the knees.
Pedal pulses were palpable.  She had some with a chronic
Foley from her rehabilitation facility and urine was [**Location (un) 2452**]
secondary to the Pyridium she had received earlier that day.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Mild bradycardia with first degree AV block.
4.  History of intermittent left bundle branch block.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
7.  Status post total hip replacement on [**2185-9-9**] with
postoperative course complicated by congestive heart failure
in the setting of aggressive fluids.
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9.  Hypothyroidism.
10. Osteoarthritis.
11. History of one month of voiding difficulty.
12. History of bladder surgery.
13. History of hysterectomy in [**2137**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has a BETA BLOCKER allergy with the
reaction noted to be mild-to-moderate bradycardia and also
beta blockers precipitate congestive heart failure in the
past.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

#1.  CARDIAC:  Ischemia.  The patient was noted to have
essentially clean coronaries less the RCA ostial at 50%.  The
patient was maintained on outpatient dose of Lipitor and
started on aspirin.  Pump:  The patient was adequately
diuresed.  The nitroglycerin drip was weaned to off and she
received Lasix p.r.n. until resolution of her fluid overload
status, both clinically and radiographically by chest x-ray.
She was started on an ACE inhibitor during this admission of
Zestril at 2.5 mg q.d. before afterload reduction.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram was done on [**2185-10-17**],
and it demonstrated left ventricular ejection fraction
greater than 60%.  She had a left ventricular systolic
dimension of 3.9 cm.  The echocardiogram was also notable for
moderate-to-severe 3+ mitral regurgitation and there was
partial mitral leaflet flail.  The left atrium was mildly
dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets were also mildly dilated.
The cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 44807**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] on [**10-17**], regarding these findings.

It was felt by the coronary care unit team that the
significantly worsening mitral regurgitation was likely a
major contributor to her presenting flash pulmonary edema and
decompensated heart failure.

Rhythm:  The patient has a history of supraventricular
tachycardias in the past.  She was maintained on her
Verapamil dose of 40 mg q.12h. during this admission.  Beta
blockade was held secondary to her allergies as mentioned
above.

PULMONARY:  The patient presented in respiratory distress in
the setting of flash pulmonary edema, secondary to elevated
systolic blood pressures intracatheterization.  She was
aggressively diuresed with marked improvement of her
pulmonary status requirement.  On the day of discharge, the
resting room air saturation was 84%, which improved to 94% to
96% on two to three liters oxygen, which should be her
requirement as she presents back to rehabilitation.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient had mild transaminitis on
presentation likely secondary to hepatic congestion in the
setting of right heart failure secondary to left heart
failure.  Subsequent to diuresis, the patient's LFT
abnormalities resolved with no further issues in this regard.

RENAL:  The patient had a stable creatinine throughout
admission and good urine output.

ENDOCRINE:  The patient has a history of hypothyroidism.  The
patient was maintained on her current dose of Synthroid
during this admission.  Sugars were adequately controlled as
well.

GENITOURINARY:  The patient has ongoing bladder dystonia
versus atonia versus urethral strictures.  She had been
followed closely by her outside urologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 43125**]
at [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **].  She should follow with him
upon return to her rehabilitation subsequent to discharge on
[**10-18**] and from a cardiac perspective she is cleared for
cystoscopy.  The patient was maintained on Pyridium at 200 mg
b.i.d. during her hospitalization.  Foley catheter was not
changed at the [**Hospital1 69**] and it
has been indwelling for approximately two weeks.

The patient was seen by the Department of Physical Therapy
during this admission.  Please see patient's report for
further details in that regard.
