Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 134**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old woman with history of ESRD on HD,
hypertension, severe PVD s/p bilateral BKA, and LVH with LVOT
who is presenting with acute shortness of breath. She was in her
usual state of health until earlier this evening when she
noticed that she "just didn't feel right." When she went to lay
down, she noted the onset of shortness of breath.  She denied
chest pain or palpitations. She had her last HD session on
Friday. She denies eating salty food or missing medications
.
In the ED her initial vital signs were 220/110 120 RR 40 and
100% on BIPAP.  She continued on BIPAP with improvement in her
oxygenation.  An EKG was interpreted as unchanged from prior.
Nitro-paste was administered for blood pressure control.  A left
femoral central line was placed for IV access.  Both cardiology
and nephrology were consulted who recommended urgent dialysis
for volume control.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain,  palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 73 year old woman with history of ESRD on HD,
severe PVD, LVH with LVOT obstruction presenting with shortness
of breath and pulmonary edema.
.
# CAD:
Although patient has with multiple CAD risk factors, prior
non-invasive and invasive testing showed no significant
obstructive coronary disease.  A troponin of 0.04 in the context
of normal CK and EKG with no ST-T changes was likely demand
ischemia secondary to hypertensive heart disease. Admission EKG
did not show signs of active ischemia and the patient was
monitored on telemetry and continued on aspirin and statin.
.
# CHF:
The pt's hypoxia was attributed to CHF and not pneumonia as she
denied any cough, and was afebrile and lacking a consolidate on
chest xray. Pulmonary embolism was also unlikely as the patient
is on chronic anticoagulation.  Due to chronic diastolic
congestive heart failure and a physiologic HOCM that leads to
hypotension during dialysis sessions, it is most likely that the
patient developed pulmonary edema  in the setting of volume
status change while receiving dialysis.  Her oxygenation status
improved significantly following blood pressure and rate control
and a dialysis session. There are no PFT's to support the
diagnosis of COPD, but marked hyperinflation on CXR and notable
smoking history indicated strong possibility of COPD
contributing to patient's symptoms so patient was treated with
home dose of spiriva and albuterol as needed. The patient was
weaned on BiPap and began to breathe comfortably on room air
following dialysis.
.
# Atrial fibrillation:
The pt was anticoagulated with coumadin and rate controlled with
metoprolol and diltiazem for her history of atrial fibrillation.

.
# Hypertension:
The patient's hypertension was also controlled with diltiazem
and metoprolol and following a successful dialysis session her
lisinopril and irbesartan were restarted.
.
# Diabetes:
For her diabetes the patient was continued on her home dose of
NPH with an insulin sliding scale.
.
# Hyperkalemia:
The patient has end stage renal disease and receiving HD.  The
patient was orginally volume overloaded and on day two of
admission developed hyperkalemia to a K of 6.7.  She had no
peaked T waves or QT prolongation on EKG and received calcium
carbonate and D5/insulin as well as dialysis.  Her electrolytes
were monitored closely with subsequent K between 4.1 and 5.0.

# Heme:
On admission labs the patient was erythrocytotic. Prior
evaluations had not shown renal mass that could contribute to
over production of erythropoietin and on [**2163-5-30**] the epo
level was low normal which would suggest a MPD such as [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
Patient would benefit from heme follow up as an outpatient.
