HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60 year old,
right handed female who started experiencing nausea and
vomiting one week ago.  She felt dizzy and had diplopia.  She
fell the day prior to admission and was brought back to bed
and could not get out of bed until the day of admission when
EMS was called.  She was brought to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital
where a CT of her head showed left frontal hemorrhage and
right occipital hemorrhage.  Also a mass was detected on her
chest x-ray and confirmed by chest CT.  Patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Lumbar diskectomy.  Hypertension.
Depression.

ALLERGIES:  None known.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.day, Univasc
30 mg q.day, thiamine 100 mg IM, MVI one p.o. q.day, Levaquin
500 mg IV q.24 hours, atenolol 75 mg p.o. q.a.m., Norvasc 10
mg p.o. q.day, folate 1 mg p.o. q.day, Tylenol and magnesium.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's heart rate was 46, blood
pressure 158/51, SAO2 96 percent, respiratory rate 19.
Patient was awake, alert, slightly lethargic, oriented times
two.  Lungs were clear, left lung slightly coarse breath
sounds.  Abdomen soft, nontender.  Cardiac regular rate and
rhythm.  Extremities had no edema.  Neurologic exam showed an
awake, slightly lethargic, oriented times two, not to time,
slightly reversed when following commands.  Right eye had
slightly decreased adduction, slight decreased elevation of
the right eye.  Also left lateral gaze nystagmus.  Face was
symmetric.  Frontalis was intact.  Moderate dysarthria.  No
obvious drift.  Upper and lower extremities were full [**5-18**] for
muscle.  Reflexes were 1+ in the upper extremities and 1 in
the lower extremities.  No Hoffmann, no clonus.  Sensation
was intact to lower extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.6, hematocrit 27.4,
platelets 309.  INR 1.3, PTT 33.2.  Sodium 139, potassium
3.4, chloride 106, CO2 22.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan for this patient was admission to
the ICU, obtain an MRI with gadolinium.  She was made NPO, IV
fluids at 80 an hour.  Neuro checks were q.one hour.  She was
given mannitol 25 q.four hours and Decadron 8 mg q.four
hours.  On [**8-13**] the patient was noted to be arousable,
oriented to person only, very dysarthric, more lethargic than
the previous day.  She had received Ativan at the time of
examination.  She did have a slight right drift.  She had an
MRI which showed a large right cerebellar T2 hypointense and
T1 hyperintense mass which measured about 5 cm in maximal
dimension.  A DWI scan [**Month (only) 3780**] loss of signal in the
right cerebellum and left frontal lobe.  MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] flow in both intracranial carotid arteries and
in the anterior middle cerebral artery.  There was flow in
the vertebral arteries.  The impression was cerebellar and
cerebral hemorrhagic masses consistent with metastasis.  The
cerebellar mass is large and there is superior herniation
into the cerebellum and compression of the fourth ventricle.

Given the patient's exam and MRI findings, it was felt that
the patient should have an emergent craniotomy for removal of
this tumor and the hemorrhagic lesion.  Prior to surgery
patient did have an interventional pulmonology consult.  They
saw her and felt she had a left upper lobe mass infiltrate
with the diagnosis that included possible pneumonia versus
lung mass versus combination.  They did follow her throughout
her stay here and did not recommend that she needed
bronchoscopy at this time.  They referred her to oncology.

The patient was brought to the O.R. on [**2144-8-13**] where she
underwent craniotomy and removal of the right cerebellar
hemorrhagic lesion.  Patient did well intraoperatively and
had no complications.  On post-op day one patient was awake,
oriented times name only, inattentive, unable to follow
midline commands.  She had abduction depression of the right
eye.  Pupils were 5 to 3.5 in the right eye and left eye 4.5
to 2.5.  She had a question of bilateral slight pronator
drift, greater on the right than the left.  Recommendations
were to keep her blood pressure less than 150, use minimal
Ativan only and to slowly advance her diet.  Her post-op
hematocrit was 25.9.  Also on the 1st she had repeat MRI
which showed status post resection of right cerebellar
hemorrhagic lesion without residual enhancement.  Left
frontal hemorrhagic lesion with enhancement was suggestive of
metastatic disease.

The patient did require the use of Nipride to keep her
systolic blood pressure less than 140.  She did have periods
of agitation at times.  On [**8-15**] patient was awake,
continued in the ICU.  Her face was symmetric.  No rebound,
no drift.  Finger to nose showed slight right dysmetria.
Patient was advanced out of bed to a chair.  Her activity was
also increased.  Patient was continued on IV Decadron 4 mg
q.six hours.  In the late afternoon of the 2nd, patient was
transferred out of the unit awake, alert and oriented times
three, moving all extremities.  Vital signs were stable.  She
did see physical therapy when moved to the floor who
recommended that she receive visitations every day by them to
assist with her impaired mobility and help with her impaired
mental status.

On [**8-16**] the patient was awake, alert, oriented,
tolerating a diet, ambulating with help.  Her dysarthria was
noted to be improved.  She had a slight right drift noted.
Her dysmetria was also improved.  Her Foley was removed.
Decadron was continued to be weaned.  Occupational therapy
also saw her and assisted her with safety awareness and
helped her with her upper extremities.  On the 5th oncology
saw patient who felt that she most likely will receive
palliative chemotherapy with radiation rather than systemic
chemo.  Patient's special stains for melanoma were found to
be negative on [**8-19**].  Patient will need to go to a rehab
facility for further assistance with her gait and
rehabilitation needs.  She is to follow up in the brain tumor
clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  She also needs to follow up with
hematology/oncology here at [**Hospital1 188**].

The patient was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia that was
diagnosed prior to admission.  She received 10 days of
Levaquin therapy.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  To keep the staples clean and dry,
do not get them wet.  She should have them removed on
[**2144-8-26**].  She can come back to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 5 to have those removed
or she can have them removed at her rehab facility.  Right
now her appointment for the brain tumor clinic is pending.
Also her appointment with oncology is pending at this time.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Heparin 5000 units subcu.
2.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
3.  Nicotine patch 20 mg per 24 hours.
4.  Lopressor 50 mg [**1-16**] tablet b.i.d.
5.  Protonix 40 mg q.day.
6.  Oxycodone with acetaminophen one to two tablets p.o.
q.four to six hours.
7.  Decadron taper down to 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.
