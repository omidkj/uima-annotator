Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
 Pt is a 83 yo female with history of bilateral PEs, HTN,
pulmonary HTN on 2 L home O2 who presents with SOB/vomiting and
found to be hypoxic. Pt states that yesterday she felt short of
breath and lightheaded ("dizzy"- which was not the room
spinning) when standing up. She vomited x 1 and her family
called 911. Pt denies recent F/C/N. No cough. No dysuria. Stable
2 pillow orthopnea. No PND.
Pt states that she has been taking her medication and partakes
in a low salt diet.  No CP. Of note, per ED note, pt states that
she did have chest pain.
.
In the ED, VS on arrival were: T: 95.7; HR: 90; BP: 155/79; RR:
18; O2: 91 2L NC. She was given 500 mg IV levaquin x 1,
prednisone 60 mg po x 1, combivent x 2, sodium bicarb in D5w and
furosemide 40 mg IV x 1.
.
Now, pt states that she feels much better. She denies CP/SOB/
feeling lightheaded or dizzy.
.
Last admission was in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year when pt came in with
SOB. She was diuresed and it was thought to be [**2-10**] increased BPs
leading to pulmonary edema in setting of other pulmonary
problems.


Past Medical History:
s/p THR 22 years ago complicated by clot in leg
s/p cataract surgery
Back pain s/p corticosteroid injections
PFTs [**8-13**]- FEv1- 52; FVC- 54%, FEV1/FVC 104.
  Spirometry is consistent with a restrictive ventilatory defect
as
  demonstrated by the reduced TLC measured on [**2152-8-29**].
Echo [**8-13**]-Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are

  normal.  Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall
  left ventricular  systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
  Right ventricular systolic  function is borderline normal.
There is
  abnormal septal motion/position. The
  aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis
  is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral
  valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
  prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
  ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired  relaxation.
There is
  severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is  no
  pericardial effusion.

Radiology:
CTA [**2152-12-16**]- IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Ground-glass opacities in the lung fields with smooth
interlobular septal thickening, most likely represents pulmonary
vascular congestion as well as pulmonary edema or congestive
heart failure.
3.  Stable but continued enlargement of mediastinal and hilar
lymph nodes not significantly changed.  The etiology of this
lymphadenopathy is unclear, however may be in part due to
congestive heart failure.
4.  Patchy peribronchial opacities in the right middle lobe may
be infectious or inflammatory in etiology.
5.  Atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta and
coronary artery calcifications.
.
CXR AP [**2152-12-16**]
1.  No evidence for congestive heart failure or infiltrate.
2.  Stable right hilar and mediastinal adenopathy, better seen
on the chest CT done subsequent to this examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 83 yo female with severe pulmonary HTN, HTN, history of
bilateral PE and recent admissions for CHF and PNA who presents
with lightheadedness, found to be hypoxic.  Her hospital course
is as follows:
.
Hypoxia: Normally on 2 L NC likely [**2-10**] severe pulmonary HTN;
PFTs also showed a restrictive pattern.  The patient was given
levaquin, prednisone, and lasix in the ED.  Given clinical
concern, she was transferred to the MICU for observation.  In
the MICU, she was ruled out for MI and PE.  CT did demonstrate
findings concerning for possible edema, infectious pneumonia, or
COP.  She was diuresed well in the MICU, and started on
levaquin.  She improved clinically and was transferred to the
floor.  On the floor she achieved her baseline oxygenation on
2-3L NC.  Pt worked with her and cleared her for home.  Her
outpatient pulmonologist was made aware of her admission.  Given
her improvement on lasix and levaquin, we felt her symptoms were
related to fluid overload and an underlying CAP.  She was
discharged to complete a course of antibiotics, she was
maintained on her home oxygen, and she was told to follow up
closely with her pulmonologist.
.
Dizziness: Was thought to be related to her initial hypoxia.
Her old records were reviewed.  Her dizziness resolved with her
improvement in symptoms.  She experienced no additional
dizziness during her admission.
.
Renal failure: Chronic renal failure with cr baseline of 1.0.
Her renal failure was thought secondary to pre-renal azotemia.
After her CTA she was hydrated with bicarb and her cr
subsequently improved during admission and remained stable.
.
HTN: Her beta blocker and ACEI were continued with good effect.
.
history of PE: Her coumadin was initially continued.  However,
it was held when her INR was supratherapeutic.  Her INR improved
to the normal range and she was restarted on a lower dose of
coumadin at 3mg PO qHS.  She will need frequent INR checks and
adjustment of her coumadin as needed.
.
Glaucoma: continued timolol eye drops
.
Code: Patient was unable to definitively decide d
