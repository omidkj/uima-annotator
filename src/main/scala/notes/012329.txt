[**2167-4-9**] 6:20 am MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.
**FINAL REPORT [**2167-4-11**]**
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2167-4-11**]):    No MRSA isolated

[**2167-4-3**] EKG:
Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2164-5-6**] there is no change.
[**2167-4-3**] CHEST XRAY:
IMPRESSION: Chronic interstitial lung disease, most pronounced
at the lung
bases, similar to prior. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
otherwise
visualized.
[**2167-4-3**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION: 1. Obstructive choledocholithiasis at the distal CBD
resulting in severe intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. Recommend ERCP to further assess.
2. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. Mild
infrarenal aortic
ectasia.
3. Calcified pleural plaques with pulmonary fibrosis with lower
lobe
predominance, compatible with asbestosis. Multiple pulmonary
nodules, grossly similar or slightly larger in appearance, for
which a nonurgent dedicated CT chest is recommended for further
evaluation.
4. Significant aortic calcification, but major intra-abdominal
arteries are patent.
5. Large right exophytic renal cyst.

[**2167-4-4**] ERCP:
Impression: 1. A moderate amount of semi solid food residue was
noted in the stomach.
2. A stricture was seen in the pylorus. The scope did not
traverse the lesion.
3. A 12mm balloon was introduced for dilation and the diameter
was progressively increased to 15 mm successfully.
4. The duodenoscope was then successfully passed into the
duodenum.
5. A mass was found at the duodenal bulb. Due to duodenal
deformity, we were unable to position the scope in front of the
ampulla to attempt biliary cannulation. Large capacity forceps
biopsies were performed for histology at the mass in the
duodenal bulb.
6. Mass in the duodenal bulb
7. Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

[**2167-4-5**] EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm, rate 81, with ventricular synchronous
pacing. Occasional ventricular premature beat. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2167-4-3**] sinus tachycardia has given way to
normal sinus rhythm and ventricular ectopy is new.

[**2167-4-6**]: ERCP:
Impression: Small ulcer noted at the pylorus, which was stenotic
but improved after dilation 2 days ago.
Mass in the duodenal bulb as seen previously - biopsies pending
A single diverticulum with large opening was found at the major
papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the biliary tree with
the CBD measuring 18 mm.
Three round stones ranging in size from 8 mm to 12 mm that were
causing partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the
common bile duct.
There was post-obstructive dilation.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
4 large stones and biliary sludge were extracted successfully
using a 15 mm balloon.
The bile duct was clear at the end of the procedure
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

[**2167-4-7**] CARDIAC PERFUSION PERSANTINE:
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate.
Left ventricular cavity size is normal, with EDV of 114 mL.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a severe fixed inferior
wall defect.
Gated images reveal mild global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 47%.
IMPRESSION: Severe fixed inferior wall defect. Mild global
hypokinesis.
