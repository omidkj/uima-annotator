He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2155-8-13**] where off pump

did well during the operation and was transferred to the CSRU
postoperatively.  He had a left internal mammary artery to
LAD and saphenous vein graft to PDA graft.  He was weaned and
extubated in the CSRU on the 11th and continued to improve.
He was started on Plavix for having an off pump coronary
artery bypass graft and Lopressor.  Chest tubes were left in
due to high output.  He was started on Imdur.

The patient was transferred to the floor postoperatively on
postoperative day #2.  His beta blocker was increased at that
time and his chest tube, his Foley and his JP drain were all
removed.  PT was consulted for evaluation for ambulation and
mobility.  They felt that he would do quite well.

On postoperative day #3, his wires were removed and he was
continued on his Plavix.  PT cleared him to go home with
services.  Due to his distance and due to the fact that he
lived at home with his wife, it was felt that he would
