Allergies:
Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on Exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right and Left Heart Catheterization
ICU Care with arterial cannulation, central venous cannulation
Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
46F s/p autologous BMT for NHL in [**2111**] with course complicated
by radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and chemo-induced
cardiomyopathy now on transtracheal O2 who presents with
increasing dyspnea on exertion, tachycardia, and cough. Although
OMR notes reveal prior complaints of DOE, patient reports
worsening over the past 2-3 weeks. Denies pleuritic chest pain
but does report some back pain with coughing. No exertional
chest pain (but she feels unable to exert herself enough to know
- no history of exertional CP). She was previously on 2L TTO at
rest and increased to 4L with activity. She has now increased to
3L at rest with >4L with activity (she reports she turns it up
as high as she can and is still unable to exercise - she even
gets short of breath brushing her teeth). She has previously had
volume overload but not in a long while and denies pedal edema
or orthopnea. She had pneumonia in [**3-7**] which presented with
neck stiffness and wheezing - she denies these symptoms at
present. Reports seasonal allergies without asthma. She has a
dog at home and has lived in the same place with that dog for
years. Previously worked as a field officer for NSTAR where she
may have been exposed to hazardous fumes, but since [**3-7**] she has
been on disability. Denies fevers.
She reports tachycardia seems to have started with this
worsening dyspnea as well.
Saw pulmonologist in beginning of [**Month (only) **] who felt she was
doing well. Seen by PT in early [**Month (only) **] as well - report states
that she gets out of breath with exertion on treadmill but at
that point she did not feel this was worse than previous and O2
sat actually was better than previously.
Of note patient is on hormone replacement therapy
(Premarin/Provers) since it was decided that she should not have
children post-chemo. She does not smoke. She has not had
personal or family history of blood clots.


Past Medical History:
1.  Non-hodgkin's lymphocytic lymphoma: Diagnosed in [**2109**],
treated with radiation and adriamycin, autologous bone marrow
transplantation in [**2111**], one episode of congesive heart failure
in the first one to two months after her transplantation, good
recovery after that and cancer free since then.
2.  IPF:  Developed SOB 2 years ago, likely related to full body
irradiation, found to have bilateral pulmonary fibrosis and
apical blebs.  Has been treated with prednisone and supplemental
oxygen.  PFTs from [**2128-2-4**] demonstrated no change in restrictive
pattern since [**2127-8-18**].
3.  Systolic Heart Failure:  Diagnosed in [**2125**] at same time of
IPF, likely due to Adriamycin treatment for NHL.  Echo from
[**2128-1-26**] demonstrated mild to moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (ejection fraction 40 percent) and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension without R-ventricular
abnormalities.  This was no change from a [**2-3**] echo.
4.  Pulm HTN:  Echo from [**2128-1-26**] demonstrated moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension without R-ventricular abnormalities
in size, structure, and contractile function.
5.  Chronic anemia:  Thought to be related to her BMT in [**2111**].
Labs in OMR since [**3-/2125**] demonstrate Hct ranging from 28.7 to
34.3.
.
PSH:
-None but currently being evaluated for lung vs heart/lung
transplant at [**Hospital1 112**]

Social History:
General:  Is single, lives with family.  No children.  Works as
