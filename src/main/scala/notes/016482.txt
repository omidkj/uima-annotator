Date of Birth:   [**2067-2-4**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital 22583**] MEDICAL

ADDENDUM:  The first part of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
was dictated previously.  This is an addendum to that
discharge summary.

The patient was called out from the SICU on [**2130-7-28**].  The
patient had multiple issues during his hospitalization which
I will review here.

1.  ABDOMINAL ABSCESS:  The patient was initially admitted
septic to the ICU with an abdominal abscess of unclear
etiology but thought to be from a perforated diverticulum.
The patient was treated with Unasyn 3 grams q. eight hours
for a total course of four weeks.  the Unasyn was
discontinued on [**2130-8-1**] after a four week course of total
antibiotics.  The patient did not require further
antibiotics.  At the time of discharge, the patient was
afebrile and without a white count.

The patient continued to have abdominal pain at that time but
of unclear etiology.  No repeat CAT scan of the abdomen was
done at that time.

2.  HYPOXIA:  The patient had been extubated prior to call to
the floor.  He did have a few episodes early in his course on
the floor of desaturation and hyperventilation.  This was
thought to be either related to [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-Stoking from his
severe congestive heart failure or from aspiration as the
patient did not pass fully his speech and swallow study.  On
discharge, he was saturating normally on room air.

3.  CARDIOMYOPATHY:  The patient was known to have a severe
cardiomyopathy with an EF found on echocardiogram of 20% when
admitted to the hospital.  The cardiomyopathy was unclear.
The patient was thought to have possibly have had
hemochromatosis as the cause of his cardiomyopathy as he also
had liver failure on admission; however, a cardiac MRI which
was obtained was read as nonischemic cardiomyopathy with
severe biventricular failure.

The patient, therefore, went for a cardiac catheterization
and a biopsy of the myocardium.  The patient's biopsy was
negative for hemachromatosis and the catheterization showed
clean coronaries.  While this did not completely rule out
hemachromatosis, it made it less likely and the etiology was
also conjectured to be a history of alcohol use, although
this patient did not admit to this as a problem.

During the biopsy, it was discovered that there was some
pericardial fat cells in the biopsy and the patient received
an echocardiogram to rule out pericardial effusions and this
was negative.

The Congestive Heart Failure Service was consulted when the
patient was admitted to the floor.  The patient was gently
diuresed as he was quite anasarcic from his hospital course.
He was continued on a good heart failure regimen with Coreg,
Isordil, Aldactone, digoxin.  The patient was on Amiodarone
from an episode of arrhythmia in the ICU and this was
discontinued.  He was also started on low-dose Captopril
prior to discharge.

On discharge, the patient was thought to be euvolemic and was
continued on 40 of Lasix to keep the patient even.  He was to
follow-up with the Congestive Heart Failure Clinic with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

4.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's creatinine had been
elevated in the ICU and thought to be ATN from sepsis.  On
discharge, the patient's creatinine was 1.1 which was likely
close to his baseline.  The patient's urine output was
normal.

5.  LIVER FAILURE:  The patient had all elevated LFTs on
admission, thought to be secondary to sepsis and multiorgan
failure.  However, there was a question whether the LFTs were
elevated because of hemachromatosis.  The Liver Service
declined a biopsy in the hospital as they felt that it was
not emergent and iron studies were not completely consistent
with hemachromatosis.  However, the patient was to follow-up
with the Liver Service as an outpatient for further workup of
his possible hemachromatosis and/or other liver abnormality.
The patient's LFTs continued to trend down while in the
hospital.  His coagulopathy also started to correct as the
patient's LFTs improved and his liver function improved.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  The patient had some blood in
his nasogastric tube while in the unit.  His hematocrit
remained relatively stable while in the hospital and he did
not require transfusion.  He should have an outpatient scope.
The scope in the hospital was normal.

7.  PANCREATITIS:  The patient's pancreatic enzymes, amylase,
and lipase were elevated while in the hospital but slowly
trended down.  The patient was continued on p.o. and had no
continuous nausea and vomiting, although occasional episodes
of this which were treated well with Phenergan.

8.  NUTRITION:  The patient was continued with TPN initially
and then transitioned to p.o.  A Speech and Swallow study
showed that he had thin liquids and this was slowly advanced.

9.  NEUROLOGY:  The patient had some mental status waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] which is probably attributed to either an old CVA
which was unmasked in the setting of sepsis and/or a residual
ICU delirium since the patient had been in the ICU for
greater than three weeks.  The patient also had severe
tremulousness when admitted to the floor which was presumed
to be an ICU myopathy by Neurology consult.  This improved
over the course of the hospital stay as he worked with PT and
got stronger.  There was still some residual tremulousness
when he was discharged.

The patient had an episode of syncope where he was found on
the floor in the bathroom.  It was unclear whether this was a
vasovagal or orthostatic event.  The patient was not
orthostatic when checked at that time but it was thought that
the patient had a vasovagal episode as he was on the toilet
prior to falling.  A head CT at the time was negative for
acute bleed.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge, the patient's
condition was fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility for acute rehabilitation.  He was to follow-up with
the Congestive Heart Failure Clinic on [**2130-8-29**] and with PCP
at the [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] Clinic, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 47725**] as well as his Liver
Clinic appointment on [**2130-9-25**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Spironolactone 25 mg one p.o. q.d.
2.  Digoxin 0.125 one p.o. q.d.
3.  Protonix 40 p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 40 p.o. q.d.
5.  Lopressor 12.5 one p.o. q.d.
6.  Captopril 25 one p.o. t.i.d.
