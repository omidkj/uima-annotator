History of Present Illness:
45 yo M with spina bifida, paraspinal lipoma treated with high
dose dexamethasone for the past 6 weeks, and nonhealing R foot
ulcer x 7 years transferred from OSH with whole L leg cellulitis
and intermitant chest discomfort. In brief, on arrival in the ED
the Pt was in respiratory distress and was transfered to the
MICU. The respiratory distress was thought to be secondary to
narcotics. He was treated with narcan and his respiratory status
improved. He was never intubated. While in the MICU he reported
ongoing chest pain. An ECG showed diffuse ST-T changes. An echo
was done which showed a pericardial effusion. Cardiology was
consulted and he was felt to have pericarditis. The etiology
remained unclear, but is most likely infectious.
.
Regarding his sepsis, in the ED the patient was tachycardic with
leukocytosis with PMN predominance and elevated bands. His BCx
grew group G Streptococcal bacteremia. The most likely source of
infection is the ongoing leg infections potentiated by high dose
dexamethasone. He was also noted to have a UTI which grew
Klebsiella oxytoca. His lactate was elevated. He was started on
vancomycin, pip/tazo, and clindamycin. He was also noted to have
multiple, scatted crusted and ulcerated lesions on the skin and
OP which are positive for HSV1. He was started on acyclovir. In
addition he complained of odynophagia. His exam was consistent
with thrush plus HSV esophagitis and he was started on
fluconazole. He is still waiting for EGD. Finally, he the above
noted chronic R foot ulcer and osteomyelitis for 7 years as well
as L leg cellulitis. After much discussion he will have BKA
within this admission of the RLLE.
.
In addition to his multiple clear infections and pericarditis,
he also has swollen knees and elbows. A diagnostic tap was
negative for pleocytosis, and culture is negative after 24hrs.
He also was noted to have transaminitis on admission which has
improved somewhat over the past 48 hours. The working diagnosis
is hypotension induced liver damage. He has diffuse acne since
starting his dexamethasone. The dexamethasone was started to
reduce inflammatin around his paraspinal lipoma. He reports
worsening urinary incontinence, most likely related to this
lesion. He is scheduled to see an OSH neurosurgeon in [**Month (only) 1096**]
for this. He has started to be tapered off these steroids.
.
On the floor tonight he is communicative and stable. He endorses
the essential components of his history. He says that the
decision to have the amputation is a relief after all the years
of infections and pain. His pain is controlled.
