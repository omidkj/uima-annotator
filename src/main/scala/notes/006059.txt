180cc. Labs showed WBC count of 12.8 (baseline is in teens) with
81% PMN and 2% bands. Lactate was normal at 1.2. Cr was at
baseline (1.2). EKG showed sinus tachycardia without ischemic

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 year old woman with asthma and bronchiectasis
who was admitted to the ICU with fevers, cough, myalgias, and
SOB x 1 week, concerning for viral infection and exacerbation of
underlying asthma, ICU admission due to increased work of
breathing, tachypnea and increasing oxygen requirement. Upon
arriving to the ICU, her influenza swab returned positive.

# INFLUENZA: As below, she was started on tamiflu and given the
severity of her symptoms and her co morbidities, she was
continued on tamiflu for 10 days.

# HOSPITAL ACQUIRED PNA:
Her clear CXR, symptoms and positive swab confirmed influenza
without superimposed bacterial infection (no evidence of
consolidation on admission) so antibiotics were not started
initially. Tamiflu was started on arrival to ICU and supportive
care with tylenol and intravenous fluids was implemented.
However, due to increasing leukocytosis, cough productive of
yellowish sputum and persistent desaturations despite tamiflu
and nebulizer treatment on [**11-25**], CXR was obtained which showed
a focal consolidation which was most likely pneumonia. Due to
these results, empiric vancomycin and ceftazidime were started
for an 8-day course to end [**2194-12-3**]. Sputum culture was sent
which revealed two different types of gram-negative rods. Due to
her bronchiectasis and previous colonizers (pseudomonas and
e.coli are the likely pathogens) which is why ceftazidime was
started.  Given that there was no evidence of MRSA growing in
the sputum culture, vancomycin was discontinued.  Atypical
coverage was not initated due to clinical picture most
consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia and initial clear
film.   On transfer to the floor, her respiratory status was
stable and pt was able to wean off supplemental oxygen.  She
received a PICC line on [**11-29**] and was discharged on [**12-1**] to
complete her final doses of ceffazidime.  She will need a follow
up CXR as an outpatient in [**4-7**] weeks to ensure resolution.

#ASTHMA EXACERBATION
Outpatient asthma regimen was maintained. Patient must be sent
out on budesonide inhaler without alteration of outpatient
asthma regimen. (She cannot tolerated fluticasone). Initially on
IV steroids at time of admission on [**11-22**] but switched to PO
prednisone taper on [**11-23**]. She completed 5 days of Prednisone at
60mg daily on [**11-27**] and was changed over to 40mg. She will need
a slow prednisone taper of 40mg x4 days to 30mg x3days to 20mg x
3 days, then 15mg x 3 days to eventual 10mg/daily which is her
outpatient dose.

# [**Name (NI) **] Pt has no history of diabetes and elevated BG
is likely in the setting of elevated prednisone dose.  On
discharge, she was on prednisone 30mg daily and requiring
approximately 8 units of lantus.  In anticipation of lowering
her prednisone dose, her lantus was decreased to 5 units on
discharge.  Her niece was given diabetes teaching and was able
to admini
