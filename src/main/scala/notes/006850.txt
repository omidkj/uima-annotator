bipolar disorder and adrenal insufficiency who was admitted
for shortness of breath.  She was recently hospitalized at
[**Hospital 1263**] Hospital from [**12-9**] to [**12-14**] for an
asthma exacerbation and pneumonia.  She was treated with
steroids, nebulizers and Azithromycin for her pneumonia.
Sputum cultures at that time grew out hemophilus influenza.
She was discharged home on [**12-14**] with a stated
peak-flow of 170.

The next day she felt short of breath and was brought to the
Emergency Department complaining of fatigue.  At that time
her respiratory rate was 24.  Her oxygen saturation was 88%
on room air which improved to 95% on 50% oxygen via Bi-PAP.
Of note, the patient has been intubated four times for her
asthma, most recently in [**2107**].  She has had multiple
hospitalizations which range from two to six times per year.
She has been hospitalized six times during the year of [**2114**].

Her stated baseline peak flow ranges from 300 to 350.  Her
asthma is exacerbated by upper respiratory tract infection,
hot weather and smoking.  She has a significant smoking
history, which has decreased from three packs per day to
three cigarettes per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was afebrile
with a temperature of 97.0 F.  Heart rate was 95.  Blood
pressure was 156/88.  Respiratory rate was 19.  Oxygen
saturation was 90% on six liters by nasal cannula.  In
general, the patient was anxious and in moderate respiratory
distress.  Head and neck exam revealed pupils to be equal,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles were
intact.  Pulmonary exam revealed poor air movement with
diffuse wheezes bilaterally.  Cardiac exam revealed regular
rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal
exam showed positive bowel sounds and mild tenderness at her
surgical incision site.  Extremities had trace edema and were
warm to palpation.

LABORATORY:  Panel 7 was significant for a BUN of 21 and
creatinine 0.8.  Glucose was 207.  CBC was significant for a
white count of 19.0 with 83% neutrophils and 4% bands.  Her
hematocrit was 39.3.

Chest x-ray showed hazy left upper lobe opacity, right
Port-A-Cath in place and mild congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  Patient was treated in the Emergency
Department with Heliox.  She was then admitted to the MICU
for further treatment.  In the MICU she was treated with 60
mg of Prednisone q. day, Atrovent nebulizers q. six hours and
Albuterol nebulizers q. one to two hours.  Her obstructive
sleep apnea was treated with Bi-PAP at nights.

Her pulmonary status was stable and the patient was not
intubated.  An arterial blood gas on [**12-16**] while five
liters oxygen by nasal cannula was 7.37/52/94.  As her
pulmonary status improved, the patient was weaned down to two
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.  She was able to maintain
saturations of 93% on room air and 90% on room air while
ambulating. At the time of discharge, the patient was begun
on a steroid taper.  Her peak flows at the time of discharge
were 260.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient received Ceftriaxone in
the Emergency Department for possible pneumonia.  She was
treated with Vancomycin and Azithromycin from [**12-15**] to
[**12-17**] for possible methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus infection.  Her white count remained
stable at 17, and sputum cultures from [**12-16**] grew
oropharyngeal flora.  Blood cultures from [**12-16**] showed one of
two bottles with coagulated negative staph.

Repeat chest x-rays on [**12-17**] revealed atelectasis with no
infiltrates.  Upon further investigation, patient was found
to be infected with hemophilus influenza while at [**Hospital 1263**]
Hospital from [**12-9**] to [**12-14**].  Her previous
infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
was an abdominal wound abscess on [**2114-7-31**].
