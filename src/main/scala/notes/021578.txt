Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13685**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath, leg swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE Guided DC Cardioversion ([**2160-7-8**])


History of Present Illness:
This is a 63M Patient with PMHx of ?GERD and ?HTN who presented
to his PCP with one month of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, 2
weeks of worsening lower extremity edema, and abdominal bloating
found to be in Afib with RVR and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.   Patient
states that beginning in [**Month (only) 958**] he experienced some abdominal
bloating and distended abdomen and sought treatment from PCP who
has been prescribing probiotics.  Probx have helped with the
distention, but only temporarily- patient has noticed increased
distension in last 2 months.  Starting about 2 weeks ago, had
significant orthopnea, PND, and increased leg swelling.  Has had
some dyspnea on exertion; patient usually can walk a mile but
has been getting short of breath on walks.  No changes in diet-
eats high vegetable diet.  Patient describes some vague back and
chest pain on and off but he attributed this to musculoskeletal
injury as he has been active recently.  Denies palpitations and
dizziness/syncope.  No nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, diaphoresis,
fevers.

The new onset leg swelling prompted patient to go to PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 3011**]
(care at Atrius) where he was found to have a HR in the 170s and
in afib.  PCP sent him to [**Hospital1 18**] ER.

ED course: In the ED patient presented with systolic BP in 140s.
 He was started on nitro gtt at 5 mcg/min and his BP rapidly
dropped to 60 systolic but recovered to 100 systolic with
discontinuing the nitroglycerin drip.  He received 20mg IV
furosemide and put out 750 cc urine.  .  He received 4 baby
aspirin tablets.  He received a
total of 7.5mg of IV metoprolol in 2.5mg boluses with a
reduction
in his heart rate to 120s

An echocardiogram was performed by the on-call fellow where the
LV appeared severely reduced and the RV function was depressed
as well.  No valvular abnormalities were noted.  No pericardial
effusion noted.

Patient was then transfered to CCU for further medical
management

Pertinent Results

TEE [**2160-7-8**]
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. LV systolic function appears
depressed. There is depressed right ventricular free wall
contractility. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta (to 30 cm from the incisor). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. A minor TEE procedure related
complication occurred (see comments for details).

IMPRESSION: No evidence of spontaneous echo contrast or clot in
the LA, LAA, RA, or RAA. Depressed biventricular global systolic
function but this was not fully evaluated.

TTE [**2160-7-8**]
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= XX
%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed
free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-7-7**],
biventricular systolic function now appears slightly more
vigorous.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111792**] is 63M with history of borderline HTN, ?GERD, and
?DM who initially presented to his PCP's office with dyspnea and
LE swelling, found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR and new
diagnosis of acute on chronic systolic heart failure.

# A Fib with RVR: The patient was found to be in new onset
atrial fibrillation, with rates initially in the 110s in his
PCPs office, but on transfer to the cardiac care unit was as
high at the 150s. TSH =5. It was unclear if A fib was secondary
to his systolic heart failure or if his heart failure was
secondary to his A fib. Morning after admission, a TEE guided
cardioversion was performed successfully. However, 1 hr later he
returned to A fib. TEE did not detect any atrial thrombus and
dabigotran was initiated. In addition, the patient was loaded
with amiodarone IV (1mg/min for 6hrs, 0.5mg/min for 18hrs) then
transitioned to amiodarone 400mg TID. The patient was also given
digoxin and carvedilol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] for rate control. During
hospitalization, ventricular rates decreased from 130's
consitently to the low 100's. The patient has been advised to
limit physical activity until he is medically optimized on
digoxin, amiodarone, and carvedilol.

#Acute on chronic Systolic heart failure- The patient presented
with symptoms of lower extremity edema, PND, and orthopnea, in
the setting of having BNP of 3065.  TTE
