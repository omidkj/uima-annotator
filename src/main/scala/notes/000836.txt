Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, fever, hypoxia to 80% on RA.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
84 yo woman with dementia at [**Doctor Last Name **] presented to ED [**2154-6-10**] with
fever to 101, cough and hypoxia to 80s on RA. On arrival in the
ED VS: 97.5 127/61 107 30 80% RA BG 260. The ED confirmed full
code with family given dementia, so proceeded with intubation
out of concern for airway protection more than hypoxia. 1 hour
after intubation she was itnermitently hypoensive to 50s
systolic (?versed related) so a central line was placed and she
was started on minimal levophed (on arrival 0.06 mcg/kg/min).
She was given zosyn 4.5gm/vanco 1gm/levaquin 750mg iv, versed
2mg iv and got a CT torso/head. She was given total 3L NS. CVP
noted to be 16-19, her ekg showed STEMI in V2-V3 with tn of 0.12
so cardiology was consulted, no cath at this time, no heparin.
Cardiology did bedside TTE: Normal LV function, no WMA.

ROS: Per children she c/o fatigue on saturday, was noted to
frequently clear her throat recently, but no other complaints
specifically.

CXR PA and lat [**6-10**] FINAL: Hyperinflation with bilateral
hemidiaphragm flattening is not changed in appearance. No
effusion, consolidation or other opacity is identified within
the lungs. The aortic arch again demonstrates calcifications,
and there is no change in appearance of thoracic kyphosis with
vertebral body wedging.
.
ECG [**2154-6-10**]: Sinus tach (103), nl axis, nl intervals, 1mm ST
elevation V2-V3, Q III, TWI III, 1mm STE III, TW flattening aVF
(new). Improved on subsequent ECG's with slower rate.

CTA Chest, CT torso [**6-10**]: 1. No evidence of PE or thoracic or
abdominal aortic aneurysm.
2. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess.
3. Some delay of passage of contrast from the great vessels,
which may represent pulmonary edema.
4. There is emphysema bilaterally. There is some atelectasis at
the bases.
5. There is a large non-obstructing gallstone in the
gallbladder.

CT Head [**6-10**]: 1. No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage. 2.
Likely chronic right maxillary sinusitis.

MRI Head ([**6-30**]):
1. No acute infarction.
2. Moderately extensive bilateral white matter FLAIR
hyperintense areas likely representing sequelae of chronic small
vessel occlusive disease, increased since [**2149**].
3. Patent major intracranial arteries, without focal
flow-limiting stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more than 3 mm,
within the resolution of MR angiogram.
4. Moderate diffusely increased signal, in the mastoid air
cells, representing fluid versus mucosal thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mrs. [**Known lastname 12347**] is an 84F w/PMH dementia who initially
presented with fever, hypoxic respiratory failure, transient
hypotension, transaminitis, ARF and NSTEMI admitted to the
intensive care unit and intubated for respiratory distress. Her
course was complicated by NSTEMI, transaminitis and ARF, all of
which thought to be secondary to hypotensive shock in the
setting of sepsis. Patients mental status remained poor and
neurology as well as geriatric services were involved in
evaluation and treatment of her condition. All her psychotropic
medications were held (memantine, razadyne, risperdal) and her
mental status significantly improved. She remained alert and
cooperative, however with some confusion which remained stable.
.
Hospital course by problem:
.
.
# Pneumonia/Septic shock/VAP: Respiratory failure on admission
due to pneumonia in the setting of fever, cough, RLL infiltrate.
Course complicated by ventilator associated PNA. She had BAL on
[**2154-6-16**], no microorg identified. Levophed briefly required for
significant hypotension post intubation.  Vancomycin was d/c'd
[**6-19**] and she completed 10 day course of levofloxacin on [**6-20**] and
8 days of zosyn on [**6-23**]. She has completed all of her abx
courses.
.
# Respiratory failure:- Initially requiring intubation as above.
 Patient with pneumonia as above.  Respiratory status also
complicated by a component of pulmonary edema after aggressive
fluid resuscitation in the setting of sepsis. She was extubated
[**6-18**]. No formal diagnosis of COPD but emphysema on CXR, airway
resistance.  Once on the floor, she again required MICU transfer
due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence, likely
due to a combination of pulmonary edema, mucous plugging, and
oversedation. Now with good respiratory function on RA (O2Sat
97-100%)

.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: She has been in and out of
Afib with RVR, rate to 150's since her admission. Seems to be
triggered by hypoxic episodes as above as well as by albuterol
neb treatments. CHADS2 score [**3-10**]. Afib seems also to trigger
pulm edema.  Albuterol/xopenex held.  Metoprolol uptitrated
significantly with improved rate control. Aspirin continued.
.
# ARF: Baseline creatinine 0.5, ARF on admission most likely due
to hypovolemia/pre-renal in setting of acute illness. Creatinine
came down and normalized. Lisinopril can be resumed in Rehab
with lower dose (2.5) and monitoring of renal function.
.
# Delirium/Dementia: Baseline dementia with intermittent
agitated delirium in the setting of acute illness and infection.
During her ICU stay she was tried on haldol with no effect,
zyprexa with short lasting effect, seroquel with best effect.
Memantine and razadyne restarted but pt became somnolent, hence
all psychotropic were held.  Geriatrics was consulted for
recommendations for behavioral control. Required 1:1 sitter at
times for safety.  Her post-discharge agitation plan includes
use of 0.25 mg haldol prn.
.
# NSTEMI: Troponin bump up to 0.12 with CK/CKMB not elevated,
most likely demand ischemia in the setting of relative
hypoperfusion from septic shock. Managed medically.  Aspirin,
statin, beta blocker continued and cardiology followed.  Stress
test as outpatient can be considered.   TTE initially showed
severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall which
subsequently appeared to resolve on echo during MICU stay. Again
ruled out for MI with most recent episode of resp distress
requiring MICU transfer.
.
# FEN: seen by speech and swallow, approved for nectar thickened
liquids and ground solids, thin liqids between meals only,
replete lytes prn, speech and swallow re-eval in Rehab to clear
pt for solids.
