Following pre-operative work-up as an outpatient, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a
same day admit and on [**1-21**] she was brought to the operating
room where she underwent an Aortic Valve Replacement and
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 1. Please see op note for

brought to the CSRU in stable condition on Levophed and
Propofol. Patient remained intubated until post op day one when
sedation was weaned and patient awoke neurologically intact.
Mechanical ventilation was then weaned and she was extubated. B
blockers and diuretics were started. And diuretics were titrated
to reach her pre-operative weight. She was weaned off of all
drips on post-operative day two and was transferred to the
cardiac step down unit. Chest tubes were also removed on this
day.  post-operative day three her WBC became rather elevated
and empiric abx were started. She eventually had a decrease of
her WBC by discharge (12.3) and were no longer continued as an
outpatient. Urine and blood cultures were negative and she
maintained no fever. EPS were consulted post-operatively to
enterogate her PPM. On post-op day six her epicardial pacing

increase in her HCT from 25.5 to 34.5. She was followed
