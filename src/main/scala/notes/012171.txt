1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity  size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely  depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include akinesis of all  of the walls with
relative sparing of the basal portion of the inferobasal wall
and hypokinesis of the mid and apical portions of that wall.
3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o female s/p cadaveric renal transplant in '[**66**] for chronic
reflux nephropathy, initially admitted for ARF, her hospital
course complicated by respiratory distress with pulmonary edema,
unstable SVT requiring cardioverstion, NSTEMI, s/p cath [**2176-7-8**].
.
# ARF in the setting of past renal transplant:
The patient initially presented with a Cr of 3.7 up from her
baseline 1.0. The etiology of her ARF was thought to be
multifactorial. The patient was markedly hypotensive on
admission. She received IV fluids and her bp's improved back to
her baseline.  There was likely some aspect of prerenal azotemia
given her N/V x10days along with being placed on HCTZ (weak
diuretic).  Less likely was vanco-induced ARF given her levels
drug levels were within nml range. There was thought to be a
mild contribution from NSAID use. The patient had no evidence to
support infxn given nml WBC, lack of fever, and nml u/a.  Renal
U/S was (-) for obstruction. Far less likely was the possibility
of rejection. The patient's ACEi was held, HCTZ was held. All
NSAIDS were held and her vanco was switched to Linezolid. She
received IV hydration. Renal saw the patient and microscopically
examined a urine sample without concerning findings. She
received Solu-Medrol 500mg x1. Her immunosupressives were
continued including Cellcept [**Pager number **], prednisone 5, rapamycin 3. Her
Cr trended downwards over the next several days on the wards
prior to transfer to the MICU.
.
# Flash pulmonary edema/hypoxia:
She was transferred to the MICU on [**2176-7-3**] for hypoxic
respiratory distress [**12-28**] pulmonary edema. At the MICU, she was
found to have a NSTEMI which most likely lead to the pulmonary
edema requiring intubation on [**2176-7-3**]. She was started on a
heparin gtt and an TTE on [**7-3**] was significant for new akinesis
of all walls and an EF of 20%.  On attempt to wean patient off
of ventilator, she had an episode of unstable SVT in the 200's
on [**2176-7-4**] with hypotension, requiring immediate cardioversion
at 100 J with success.  She was successfully extubated on
[**2176-7-5**] with good O2 sats.
.
# Delirium/Change in MS:
After extubation, when her sedation was decreased, she developed
an acute delirium, was agitated, pulling at tubes and cursing at
staff.  Her antibiotics were held briefly due to acute change in
mental status.
.
Patient was nauseated and vomiting during her MS change. The
etiology of this was unknown at the time. Possibilities were
thought to include toxic/metabolic including drug induced,
infectious in the setting of immunosuppressive therapy, or
vascular disease. Sources of toxic/metabolic included steroid
induced and rapamycin toxicity. Rapamycin levels were within
normal limits. Her single steroid dose of 500mg on admission
potentially lingered due to decreased clearance in the setting
of acute renal failure. The patient had an LP to rule out an
infectious process and this was essentially non-diagnostic.
Blood and urine cultures were without growth. The patient had a
contrast CT of her head to rule out aneurysm or bleed given her
history of an aneurysm. No definitive source for her mental
status change was found. She was transferred to the MICU prior
to improvement of this symptom. On the day of transfer to the
MICU the patient received a central line after she was unable to
tolerate any PO's, failed peripheral access and pulled her PICC
line.
.
She improved thereafter, and called out to the floor on [**2176-7-6**]
in stable condition.
While on the floor, she became progressively dyspneic, hypoxemic
(from 2L NC -> NRB), and hypertensive, and was readmitted to the
MICU.  She was given multiple dose
