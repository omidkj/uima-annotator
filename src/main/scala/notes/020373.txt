HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old male
with a previous medical history significant for nonischemic
cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 25-30% on transthoracic
echocardiogram [**9-9**], atrial fibrillation diagnosed two years
ago, who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**1-7**] for elective dofetilide
treatment for his atrial fibrillation since diagnosis of AFib
two years ago.  Patient has had multiple routine visits to
his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been on amiodarone.
However, he has had increased dyspnea on exertion over the
course of this past fall.  Patient was evaluated for possible
amiodarone toxicity.  Amiodarone was D/C'd.  Upon admission,
dofetilide was started and planned for cardioversion prior to
discharge.

On the morning of [**1-9**], patient reported not feeling well
subjectively and had converted to sinus [**1-8**].  EKG was noted
to be bradycardic on telemetry, and had an EKG with a QTc of
over 600.  At 10 a.m., patient felt lightheaded following a
bowel movement.  His blood pressures noted to be in the
80s-90s systolically and after returning to bed, patient had
two witnessed syncopal episodes with a ribbon strip
demonstrating torsades de pointes versus polymorphous VT
lasting less than one minute and terminating spontaneously.
Patient was subsequently admitted to the CCU for observation
and for likely pacemaker placement.

PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Nonischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy was above.
2. Atrial fibrillation x2 years.
3. Hypothyroid status post partial thyroidectomy secondary to
a nodule 15-20 years prior to this admission.
4. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is a nonsmoker.  Drinks 1-2 drinks
per night.  Is married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had MI in his 60s.  No other cardiac
history.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Synthroid.
2. Coumadin.
3. Cozaar.
4. Lasix.
5. Potassium chloride.
6. History of amiodarone, but no longer taking.
7. Atenolol.
8. Flomax.
9. Proscar 5.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE CCU:  Temperature 98.2,
blood pressure range 77-118/42-70, pulse 35-75, respiratory
rate 18, 98% on room air.  Weight 100 kg.  In general, in no
acute distress, full sentences, alert and oriented times
three.  HEENT:  Mildly injected sclerae, pink conjunctivae.
EOMI.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyroid masses are noted.
Pulmonary:  Trace crackles at right base that are decreased
with cough.  Cardiovascular examination:  S1, S2, regular
rate, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, no JVD.  Abdominal
examination:  Soft, nontender, normal bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Trace lower extremity edema.  Neurologic is
nonfocal.

DATA:  White count 7.7, hematocrit 48, platelets 134.

TTE [**10-6**] showed an ejection fraction of 25-30%.
Catheterization on [**10-9**] showed no narrowing of coronary
arteries, PAH 44/20 and global left ventricular hypokinesis
with an EF estimated at 43%.

An [**10-10**] chest CT shows apical lung emphysema, small
bilateral effusions, positive calcified plaques consistent
with asbestos exposure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the CCU and given
his possible torsades versus polymorphic VT, was started on
isoproterenol.  His metoprolol was discontinued.  His
electrolytes were followed closely with a goal magnesium of
2.5.  Patient was kept NPO and taken to surgery by
Electrophysiology for a pacemaker on [**2198-1-10**].

Patient had a [**Company 1543**] 50TG placed with no difficulty.  No
adverse effects.  Chest x-ray PA and lateral day following
procedure [**2198-1-11**] was clear and normal.  Patient was
maintained on antibiotics for 48 hours following placement of
this pacemaker.  Patient was started on Toprol XL 25 q.d.
with good results.  Patient's Coumadin was held and will be
restarted five days following procedure.  Patient will follow
up in Device Clinic on [**2198-1-17**] as well as with Cardiology.

Heme:  Patient was admitted with an INR of 2.4.  He was
administered multiple doses of vitamin K for an INR
compatible for surgery.  Patient's INR postsurgery was 1.7
and trended down.  Patient will begin his Coumadin at home
dosing five days post procedure.

Pulmonary:  Patient is noted to have an increased oxygen
requirement on [**2198-1-11**], where it has been 93% on room air.
He was now 89% on room air.  This was thought likely to be
secondary to sedation with Ambien.  Patient was ambulated,
and found to have an O2 saturation of 95% later on the day
[**1-11**] prior to his discharge.

Renal:  Patient's creatinine is stable at 1.0.  He was
continued on his Tamsulosin for benign prostatic hypertrophy.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2. Nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
3. Ventricular tachycardia.
4. Status post pacer implantation.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  Patient will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] on [**2198-1-15**] at 4 p.m.  Patient will follow up
with Device Clinic [**2198-1-17**] 10 [**Initials (NamePattern5) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 23**] [**Location (un) 436**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient had normotensive blood
pressure 120/80, heart rate 72, 93% ambulating on room air.
He had an INR of 1.7, hematocrit of 44.5, creatinine 1.0,
white count of 9.8, O2 saturations were good with ambulation.
Pain was well controlled.  There is no chest pain.  Patient
is taking last day of oral antibiotics.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Losartan 50 q.d.
2. Furosemide 40 q.d.
3. Tamsulosin 0.4 q.d.
4. Finasteride 5 q.d.
5. Ranitidine 150 b.i.d.
6. Levothyroxine 100 mcg q.d.
7. Warfarin to be started on [**1-15**].
8. Metoprolol XL 25 q.d.
9. Docusate 100 b.i.d.
