IDENTIFICATION:  Baby boy [**Known lastname 3825**] [**Known lastname **] is an 18 day old
term infant with respiratory distress syndrome who is being
discharged from the [**Hospital1 69**]
neonatal intensive care unit.

HISTORY:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] was born on [**2108-6-19**] as a 4900
gram product of a 38 and [**5-19**] week gestation pregnancy to a 37-
year-old gravida 5 para 1-2-2 mother with estimated date of
confinement of [**2108-6-29**]. Maternal history is notable for
Crohn disease treated with prednisone.

Prenatal laboratory studies included blood type O positive,
antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative,
rubella immune, RPR nonreactive and group B strep unknown.

The infant was born by repeat cesarean section without any
sepsis risk factors noted. At delivery, the infant was
vigorous with Apgar scores of 8 and 9. The infant was
initially admitted to the newborn nursing and was noted to
develop tachypnea and mild work of breathing. Oxygen
saturations were in the low 80s and the infant was brought to
the neonatal intensive care unit for admission.

GROWTH PARAMETERS AT BIRTH:  Weight 4900 grams, greater than
90th percentile. Length 50 cm, 90th percentile. Head
circumference 37.5 cm, greater than 90th percentile.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory: On admission, the infant was placed on nasal
    cannula oxygen for mild hypoxia. The infant required up
    to 150-200 cc of nasal cannula oxygen. The infant
    initially was noted to have mild work of breathing with
    mild tachypnea. These symptoms gradually improved over
    the first 24-48 hours of admission. Chest x-ray revealed
    hazy granularity in the basilar regions consistent with
    mild hyaline membrane disease. Over the next several
    days, the infant's respiratory status gradually improved
    such that by day of life [**4-15**], the infant was comfortably
    breathing with minimal work of breathing and was
    requiring low nasal cannula oxygen at 25-50 cc of flow.
    However, this oxygen requirement persisted with attempts
    to wean the infant to room air failing due to drifting
    oxygen saturations to the low 90s and high 80s. Repeat
    chest x-ray at approximately 1 week of life was similar
    to initial with mild haziness at the bases consistent
    with mild respiratory distress syndrome. Chest x-ray at 2
    weeks of life was largely normal. Arterial blood gas at 2
    weeks of life was reassuring with a pH of 7.49, PCO2 38,
    PO2 114. On day of life 16, due to generalized edema on
    exam and persistent oxygen requirement, the infant was
    given a dose of Lasix with a brisk diuresis. The infant
    was successfully weaned to room air shortly thereafter.
    The infant remained on room air for the next 48 hours and
    was thus discharge to home on day of life 18.
2.  Cardiovascular: The infant remained cardiovascularly
    stable throughout admission. Due to persistent oxygen
    requirement, a cardiac evaluation was performed with an
    EKG that was normal, hyperoxia test that was normal and
    4-extremity blood pressures that were normal. An
    echocardiogram was finally done on day of life 14 that
    revealed normal anatomy with a small atrial septal defect
    with left to right flow, normal ventricular function and
    no evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition: The infant was initially
    maintained on IV fluids due to mild respiratory distress
    as well as initial D-stick in the 30s. Subsequent D-
    sticks were all within normal limits. Enteral feeds were
    begun on day of life 1 and advanced gradually.
    By day of life [**4-15**], the infant was ad lib feeding Similac
    20 without difficulty. The infant continued to feed well
    with excellent intake and adequate weight gain. Urine and
    stool output remained brisk throughout. Electrolytes were
    measured on day of life 14 and these were within normal
    limits. Weight at the time of discharge was 5200 grams.
4.  ID: CBC and blood cultures were sent on admission. White
    count was 15.8 with 68% polys and 1% bands. Hematocrit
    50.7 and platelets were 223. Ampicillin and gentamicin
    were started and these were discontinued at 48 hours with
    negative blood cultures. The infant was noted to develop
    a candidal rash in the diaper area, treated with
    Miconazole powder.
5.  GI: The infant was noted to develop mild
    hyperbilirubinemia that did not require phototherapy.
    Peak bilirubin was 15.6/0.3 on day of life 5.
6.  Development: The infant's temperature remained stable in
    an open crib throughout admission. The neurologic exam
    remained normal throughout.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The infant was stable on room air
with oxygen saturation greater than 94%. The infant was
feeding similac 20 on an ad lib basis with adequate intake and
adequate weight gain. Weight is 5.200 kg.

DISPOSITION:  Home.

NAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 37327**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72857**]. Phone
number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 35938**].

ROUTINE HEALTHCARE MAINTENANCE:  Hearing screen was performed
and passed prior to discharge. Car seat safety screening was
performed and passed prior to discharge. The infant received
first hepatitis B vaccination on [**2108-7-4**]. State screens
were sent on [**6-22**] and [**2108-7-3**] with no abnormal results
received to date.

FOLLOWUP:  The infant will follow with the pediatrician three
days after discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Large for gestational age term infant.
2.  Respiratory distress syndrome.
3.  Testis evaluation negative.
