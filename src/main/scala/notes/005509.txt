CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2135-12-8**] 8:15 AM
FINDINGS: No previous images. The patient has taken a poor
inspiration. There is extensive opacification consistent with a
large right pleural effusion and underlying atelectasis or
possibly even pneumonia. Less marked changes are seen at the
left base. The upper lungs are essentially clear.

CT ABD W&W/O C  [**2135-12-5**] 9:08 AM
COMPARISON: Outside hospital multiphasic CT dated [**2135-12-2**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen
prior to and following the intravenous administration of 150 ml
of Optiray, in multiple phases. Coronal and sagittal
reformations are provided.

CONTRAST: Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to
the rapid rate of bolus injection required for this examination.
Oral contrast is present in the colon from a previous
administration.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again
seen in the right lobe of the liver is a large intraparenchymal
hematoma measuring 10.6 x 14.5 cm in greatest transaxial
dimension. This contains heterogeneous internal density, but no
evidence of active extravasation of contrast on multiple phases.
A large subcapsular hematoma which tracks along with dome and
right lateral aspect of the liver is approximately unchanged in
size (14.4 x 7.1 x 8.1 cm). Heterogeneous, enhancing parenchyma
is seen about the right lateral aspect of the intraparenchymal
hematoma, and shows prompt arterial phase enhancement to the
degree that is greater than the normal hepatic parenchyma, and
persistent delayed phase enhancement similar in degree to the
hepatic parenchyma. No other definite hepatic lesions are
identified; several hypodense foci tracking in a curvilinear
pattern through the right lobe, likely represents
intraparenchymal tracking of hemorrhage, although the pattern is
unusual and might relate to mass effect from the
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is an accessory left hepatic
artery arising separately from the left gastric artery, and
additional right and left hepatic arteries arising in a
conventional fashion from the common hepatic artery. Portal
veins and hepatic veins are patent. There is no evidence of
tumor thrombus in the portal veins. In the left upper quadrant,
a 2.1 cm heterogeneously dense structure (3A:33) shows
connection to the gastric fundus (image 29), consistent with a
gastric diverticulum. The spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys
appear unremarkable. There are no pathologically enlarged
mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The pancreas appears
within normal limits, and there is no dilation of the pancreatic
duct. Since the examination of [**12-2**], the amount of blood
tracking throughout the abdomen has increased slightly, although
there is no evidence of extravasation of contrast or new clot to
suggest a site of active bleeding.

Large bilateral low-density pleural effusions have increased
since the previous examination, along with corresponding
atelectasis of the lower lobes. The imaged portions of the heart
and pericardium appear unremarkable.

BONE WINDOWS: Bone windows show no evidence of suspicious lytic
or sclerotic osseous lesions.

MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS: Coronal and sagittal reformations are
helpful in delineating the above described findings.

IMPRESSION:
1. Intraparenchymal and subcapsular hepatic hematoma arising
from a heterogeneously enhancing right lobe mass, without
evidence of active extravasation and no significant change in
size since [**2135-12-2**].
2. Mild increase in intraperitoneal hemorrhage within the
abdomen, a finding which could reflect previous bleeding or
redistribution of hemorrhage from the previous examination.
3. Heterogeneously enhancing parenchyma about the periphery of
the hemorrhage suggests underlying mass. Adenoma is considered
most likely given demographics, although if patient has risk
factors for liver disease, hepatoma would be considered.
4. Large bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis. Findings are not suggestive of hemothorax.
5. Gastric diverticulum.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU on [**2135-12-2**] from an
outside hospital and her hematocrit was measured every four
hours.  In the ICU, the patient received fluids and had serial
abdominal exams to assess for any acute change.
On [**2135-12-4**] the patient's diet was advanced from clears to as
tolerated.

[**2135-12-5**] two units of PRBCs were transfused for a decreasing
hematocrit.  CT abdomen showed no active extravasation and no
significant change in size of hematoma since [**12-2**].
The patient was closely monitored in the ICU and remained
afebrile and stable and was transferred to the floor on
[**2135-12-8**].  Chest x-ray on [**12-8**] showed a right lower lobe
consolidation and was started on a 14 day course of
levofloxacin.

[**12-9**] A cardiology consult for tachycardia was obtained and they
assumed the tachycardia was due to an acute illness (anemia,
fever) with some stress response.

The patient continued to do well without need for further blood
transfusion.  She is to be discharged home [**12-12**].
