History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 2270**] [**Known lastname 100793**] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman
with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent [**Last Name (un) 7792**] in [**11-4**], sCHF
(EF 25-30%), CAFib, and HTN who was found down at Rehab with VT.
Per report, she was doing well at [**Hospital 392**] Rehab until yesterday
8:15 PM when she was found minimally responsive in the toilet
without signs of trauma. To minutes afterwards became
unresponsive, without pulse and without breathing in front of
nursing staff. They started CPR immediately and placed AED that
shocked her twice (120 J and 150 J respectively). EMS arrived
and per their report she was in sinus rhythm with ventricular
ectopy. She had a pulse and was breathing. She received 100 mg
lidocaine IV bolus. She was transfered to [**Hospital3 5365**]. Her
initial BP was ~70/40 mmHg and no neurologic exam or [**Location (un) 2611**] is
documented. She was intubated for "airway protection" with
Propofol, etomidate and succynilcoline and BP dropped afterwards
and dopamine was started.
.
Initial labs showed: K of 7.5, creatinine of 3.38, Na 132, WBC
of 15.9 with left shift, PLT 246, CK 38, MB 2.3, TNT 0.05. Other
labs included: PT 14, INR 1.4, BUN 66, Ca 8.3, AST 52, ALT 39,
TP 5.3, Albumin 2.9, Globulin 2.4, AP 162. Her ECG showed sinus
rhythm with LBBB unchanged from prior here on [**11-14**]. She
received kayexalate, insulin, calcium gluconate and was
transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the BIDMCs ER VS were T 97.7, HR 81, BP 104/46, RR 19, SpO2
100% on AC 450/5/50/RR?. Per report she was moving L
.
In discussion with RN at rehab, she denies that patient has h/o
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She further denies
patient with complaints of recent fevers, chills or rigors,
exertional buttock or calf pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems [**Name8 (MD) **] RN is notable for absence of chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

hypodensity in the
right frontal lobe, age indeterminate w/o prior study for
comparison, but

CT HEAD [**1-1**]
There is interval development of hypodense appearance of the
cerebral
parenchyma on the right side diffusely, in the right frontal,
parietal and
temporal lobes predominantly, with sulcal effacement and loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation. Findings can relate to acute
infarction or
hypoxic/anoxic/ischemic injury Evaluation of basal ganglia,
brain stem and
posterior fossa structures is limited, as also evidence for
herniation. No
acute gross hemorrhage is noted. Study significantly limited due
to artifacts from the electrodes. Consider repeating after
removal of electrodes, if appropriate and correlate clinically.
Evaluation for associated infection is limited

KUB [**12-31**]
An NG tube has been advanced, and is
likely within distal stomach. There has been a decrease in
distension of a
loop of bowel within the mid abdomen, now measuring
approximately 4.5 cm
(previously 5.5 cm). This likely reflects a small bowel loop
rather than
colon. There is no free air or pneumatosis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in a dilated loop of bowel in the mid
abdomen, likely reflecting small bowel.
2. NG tube tip in distal stomach.
