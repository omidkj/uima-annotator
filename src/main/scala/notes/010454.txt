History of Present Illness:
65 year old male with severe aortic stenosis who has been
referred for evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement.
He reports shortness of breath at rest and on exertion
accompanied by constant chest pressure at rest and on exertion

echocardiogram performed by on [**2199-3-5**] revealed severe aortic
stenosis with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 cm2/peak grad 85 mmHg/ mean 48. A nuclear
stress test showed no ischemia. He was referred for right and
left heart catheterization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2199-3-12**] Cardiac Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was patent.
The LAD
was patent. The LCX had a proximal OM1 lesion that was tightly
occluded.
The ramus was tightly occluded proximally as well. The RCA was
patent.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and
right-sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 8mmHg and PCWP of 10mmHg. There
was mild
pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PASP of 34mmHg. The
cardiac index
was mildly depressed at 2.2 L/min/m2. There was severe aortic
stenosis
with a mean gradient of 50mmHg and a calculcated valve area of
0.7cm2.

[**2199-3-13**]  Carotids
Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis.

Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
The aortic valve is bicuspid with a vertical commissure. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
study.

POST-CPB:
A bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position. The valve
is well-seated with normally mobile leaflets. There are no
paravalvular leaks seen and there is no apparent AI. The peak
gradient across the aortic valve is 31mmHg, the mean gradient is
16mmHg with CO of 4.3L/min.

The LV chamber size is small, consistent with hypovolemic state.
Biventricular function is normal, as in pre-bypass. There are no
changes to other valvular function.

There is no apparent aortic dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 M with aortic stenosis and dyslipidemia, presented with
dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure, and was found to have
severe aortic stenosis and left circumflex disease.  Cardiac
surgery was consulted taken to the operating room on [**2199-3-15**]
for coronary artery bypass saphaneous vein graft to the Obtuse
marginal and Aortic valve replacement with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6158**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
porcine. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward
the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication. He was transfused
with 1 unit of PRBC on [**2199-3-17**] for a HCT of 24.  Renal function
was found to be mildly elevated with CRE 1.4 (base 0.8). Toradol
was discontinued and IV furosemide was changed to PO. The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
