History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 82yo male PMHx COPD, Systolic CHF (EF25%). The pt
is a poor historian but he felt short of breath for several
days--he is not sure how long. He also endorsed a productive
cough with green sputum and subjective fevers. He is not sure
about dysuria/frequency. Few days before the admission, he
suffered a mechanical fall, after which he developed the cough
w/ sputum, subj fevers.

In the ED, initial VS were: 101.1 89 112/55 18 97% RA. Due to a

found. His ua showed evidence of a uti. He was treated with iv
levofloxacin, ctx, and vancomycin.  The pt was admitted to the
MICU on [**2135-12-21**] and underwent treatment for HCAP/CAP and COPD
exacerbation w IV prednisone, levofloxacin, vancomycin, zosyn,
with improvement in respiratory status.

In last 36 hrs in the MICU, pt's sbps were better (in the low

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: 82yo M w/ history of multiple medical problems
including COPD and CHF with EF 25% who is admitted to the
medicine floor from the MICU for managment of hypotension and
pneumonia. Now comfortable on RA after complete course of
levofloxacin and po steroids.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Pneumonia: Pt had a RLL infiltrate on lat CXR, 101.1 F in the
ED, productive cough. Given recent prior hopsitalization,
patient was started on HCAP treatment. However, pt improved
considerably from a respiratory point of view, was afebrile,
tolerating RA with wheezes much improved. So was given
levofloxacin (days [**7-25**])

# COPD Exacerbation: Pt was treated for COPD exacerbation w/
prednisone po, albuterol and ipratropium nebs d/t pna possibly
[**1-19**] aspiration event. Now tolerating RA with minimal wheezing.
We continued albuterol/ipratropium nebs, fluticasone inhaler but
held tiotropium

# Cr Bump: baseline Cr 1.6. Cr peaked at 1.9, possibly [**1-19**] IV
lasix but down trending to 1.7 on d/c. We held losartan, and
continued lasix 20mg daily

#Hypertension: We continued metoprolol and isosorbide, holding
losartan

INACTIVE ISSUES:
# Chronic Systolic CHF:  pt has an EF of 25% indicating poor
forward flow. We continued metoprolol and lasix , but held
losartan in the setting of Cr bump

# CAD:  minimally eleva
