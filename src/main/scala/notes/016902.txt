Chief Complaint:
Bleeding from Tracheostomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2168-1-18**] Rigid bronchoscopy, exploratory trach site for bleeding


History of Present Illness:
80 yo F with hx of MI without intervention in [**10/2167**] resulting
in respiratory distress and prolonged intubation requiring
tracheostomy. Pt was discharged to vented rehab ([**Hospital 5503**]
Rehab) and had been doing well until trach site began to bleed
on
[**2168-1-18**]. She was taken to [**Hospital6 **] where she was
observed to bleed 200-300cc from trach site. Her trach was
changed to a 6 cuffed tube with decreased bleeding after
inflation of the cuff. Because of tachycardia the OSH gave the
patient 2u pRBCs, her post transfusion crit at the OSH was 32.5
up from 25.8 on [**2168-1-17**]. Her INR was 1.1. She was diaphoretic
and unresponsive during this episode and placed on ventilatory
support. She did have an EKG that did not show any signs of
acute
myocardial ischemia. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
bronchoscopy and identification and control of the bleeding
source.
On arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED she denied c/p, sob or n/v she was
awake and alert following commands. There was blood staining on
her clothes and on the trach ties althouth there was not active
bleeding coming from around the trach. She did have blood tinged
sputum on suctioning of the trach. Arrangements were made to
take
her urgently to the OR for evaluation and treatment of the
tracheal site bleeding.

CXR: [**2168-1-18**] PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
Tracheostomy tube is noted with tip in satisfactory position,
terminating approximately 3.1 cm from the carina. Low
inspiratory lung volumes are noted, and there is elevation of
the right hemidiaphragm. Cardiac silhouette appears normal in
size. The aorta is tortuous with mural calcifications noted.
Crowding of the pulmonary vascularity is seen as a result of low
inspiratory volumes, but no overt pulmonary edema is visualized.
Blunting of the costophrenic sulci bilaterally suggests small
bilateral pleural effusions. Additionally, bibasilar opacities
are seen, which could represent atelectasis, but infection is
not excluded.  No pneumothorax is visualized. No acute skeletal
abnormalities are visualized.

IMPRESSION: Low inspiratory lung volumes which limits assessment
of the lung bases. Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Small
bilateral pleural
effusions. Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis, but
infection is
not excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 19649**] was transferred from [**Hospital 5503**] Rehab Hospital for
hemoptysis. She was taken to the operating room for flexible and
rigid bronchoscopy which showed granulation tissue proximal to
the trach with mild oozing from the from the right
lateral wall which subsided with saline flushing.  No active
bleeding in the stoma, trachea istal to trach stoma, right
bronchial tree or left bronchial tree.  Clot was seen throughout
the distal airway and therapeutic aspiration was perormed in
both bronchial trees.  She transferred to the SICU and remained
on the vent over night
CMV 0.4/400/20/5. Oxygen saturation 100%.  Slight ooz from trach
site otherwise clear. Trach #7 Portex Cuff inflated.

Respiratory: POD1 she wean to 50% trach mask.  RR: [**12-16**] Sats:
