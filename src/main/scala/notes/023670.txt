Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 year old woman with asthma and chronic osteomyelitis on
vanc/cefepime/flagyl at ALF, just discharged a day prior to
admission for SOB suspected secondary to dCHF exacerbation,
improved after diuresis and BIPAP for worsening SOB.  She had
done well overnight and been off oxygen per report but then was
found acutely short of breath the following morning with a an
SBP in the 190s with HR in 120s, RR 30s and desaturating to
oxygen saturations in the 80s.  She  denied SOB, CP, cough,
fever but her speech is quite limited in content due to her
severe dementia and she answers she's "pretty good" and that she
has no problems to almost all questions.

Of note, she has been admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] twice within the last
month and has been re-admitted within 24 hours both times. Her
first admission in early [**Month (only) **] was for confusion. She was
found to have Coag neg Staph bacteremia, attributed to her PICC
line. PICC was replaced and [**Month (only) **] cultures were negative at
discharge. She re-presented with worsening dyspnea on [**9-20**] and
was admitted with presumed CHF exacerbation. She responded well
to diuresis with furosemide, though did have an episode of
hypoxia after diuresis that was attributed to asthma. She was
discharged on bronchodilators and furosemide 20mg PO daily,
which was not titrated up from admission dose. No discharge
weight documented but per discharge summary was on room air with
no crackles or edema on exam.

In the ED inital vitals were 155/70 102 44 89% RA. She was
placed on BiPAP immediately and RR improved to high 20s, though
pt. did look for a time as if she was headed for intubation. EKG
showed sinus tachycardia with no ischemic changes. Labs notable
for troponin <.01, Hct 28 above recent baseline. CXR showed
bilateral pleural effusion, increased vascular congestion c/w
fluid overload. Bedside U/S showed no pericardial effusion,
Kerley B lines. Exam notable for wheezes. She was given Lasix
20mg IV, Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs, SoluMedrol 125mg. Foley
was placed and she had immediate output of 500cc. She was
started on a nitro gtt with goal SBP 120 and is being admitted
to the ICU due to need for nitro gtt. VS at transfer to ICU
137/58 105 22 99% 2L NC.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pt answers questions about ROS with yes or
no though high suspicion of her reliability.  She denied
essentially all complaints on review of systems including her
presenting complaint.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 84 F with CAD, DM c/b neuropathy, PVD s/p multiple
amputations, chronic bilateral foot osteomyelitis on
vanco/cefepime/flagyl and recent admission for dyspnea
attributed to CHF who presents with worsening dyspnea due to
diastolic CHF exacerbation.

# Acute exacerbation of chronic diastolic CHF: The patient
presented with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and pulmonary edema on
chest radiograph in the context of hypertension with known
diastolic CHF strongly pointing to CHF exacerbation as the
etiology of her decompensation.  On arrival she briefly required
BiPAP in the ED when oxygen therapy proved inadequate.  With
that and furosemide IV she had a considerable amount of diuresis
and improved but as systolic [**Year (4 digits) **] pressures, which were felt to
partially drive this exacerbation, required nitroglycerin to
control she was admitted to the Medical ICU.  There she was not
diuresed further (amt removed in [**Name (NI) **] unclear though reported
around 2L) and actually developed a positive fluid balance over
time in the MICU.  Nevertheless, her anti-hypertensive regimen
was increased and with better control of her BP's she
significantly improved and was off oxygen therapy by her
transfer to the floor approximately 24-36 hours after admission.
 On the floor diuresis was continued with IV furosemide and PO
torsemide (given concern the patient may have gut wall edema
interfering with absorption) and had brisk diuresis of at least
one liter a day.  Chest radiograph appeared improved.  She was
started on beta blocker (switched to carvedilol from metoprolol)
and ACEi (switched to enalapri
