Chief Complaint:
Left sided weakness (face, arm, leg)


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation x2
Stereotactic brain biopsy
Stereotactic brain aspiration
IVIG x5 days


History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old woman with hx MG for >7 yrs on Mestinon
only, post-polio syndrome, who presents with several weeks (and
possibly months) of progressive generalized weakness.  She
reports that she began to feel unwell when her husband died in
[**6-29**] of a stroke - she felt depressed.  In [**7-29**], she developed a
GI virus and had profuse vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain
as well as chills and worsening weakness over several weeks,
unable to keep her mestinon down at times.  She had a headache
with this and was prescribed percocet and told to sleep in a
soft collar at night to help with neck muscle contraction.  The
GI virus cleared three weeks ago, but she still felt weak all
over, as if her myasthenia was getting worse.  Two weeks ago she
had fevers and chills at home for about a week, which have since
resolved (one week ago).  She feels that her speech has become
softer and she feels out of breath, particularly when she talks
or does any amount of exercise.  She doesn't even want to walk,
because it makes her feel markedly weak.  When she swallows, the
liquid comes out her nose.  She continues to take pills and has
not complained of choking on foods or liquids.  Her daughter
noticed a left facial droop about 4-5 days ago.  She c/o no new
numbness, tingling, diplopia or new visual changes, trouble with
hearing or headaches except as aforementioned.  She did fall
several weeks ago and struck the right side of her head, but has
not had pain at that site since then.  She has had no cp, cough,
dysuria, or recent GI sx.

Past Medical History:
-Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] - dx'ed before [**2121**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
on Mestinon only with no hx use of immunomodulatory agents
(steroids, cellcept), no hx intubation or hospitalizations for
her MG, in general under "very good control."  She has baseline
fatiguable weakness of delt at times, has not had recent ptosis.

-Post-polio syndrome, with bulbar features - soft speech,
occasional trouble with swallowing
-HTN
-Raynaud's phenomenon
-s/p TAH
-MVP

Social History:
Lives alone; husband died in [**6-29**] of stroke at [**Hospital1 112**], daughter
involved with care.  No tob, etoh, drugs.


Family History:
No strokes, no MG or neurological d/o's in family.

NIF -12, FVC  1.05
T 98.4  HR 55  BP 142/73  RR 14  100%RA
General appearance: fatigued appearance, elderly white female
HEENT: moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx
Neck: supple, no bruits
Heart: regular rate and rhythm
Lungs: diminished breath sounds at R>L base
Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs
Extremities: warm, well-perfused
Skull & Spine: Neck movements are full and not painful to
palpation in the paraspinal soft tissues

Mental Status: The patient is alert and attentive, +DOW
backwards, registered three objects at 30 seconds and recalled 3
out of 3 items at 3 minutes. Good knowledge for current events.
Language is [**Hospital1 5235**] with no errors. There is no apraxia or
agnosia.

Cranial Nerves: There is mild ptosis after upgaze for 45
seconds. The visual fields are full. The optic discs are normal
in appearance.  Eye movements are normal, with no nystagmus.
Pupils react equally to light, both directly and consensually -
though there is <1mm anisocoria with R eye slightly bigger than
L.  Sensation on the face is [**Hospital1 5235**] to light touch, pin prick.
There is a L UMN facial droop.  Hearing is [**Hospital1 5235**] to finger rub.
 The palate elevates in the midline.  The tongue protrudes in
the midline and is of normal appearance.

Motor System: Decreased bulk symmetrically throughout, normal
tone throughout.  There is 4+/5 weakness of neck extensors, and
4+/5 weakness of R deltoid, 4/5 weakness L deltoid.  The R
deltoid has fatiguable weakness after 30 seconds of
abd/adduction exercises is 4-/5.  R bicep 4+/5, R tricep 4+/5,
full at R wrist ext, full R finger ext/flex.  L bicep 4+/5, L
tricep [**4-28**], 4+/5 wrist ext, 5-/5 finger ext, [**5-28**] finger flex.
In lower ext, R IP is 5-/5, R ham is 5-/5, R quad is full, R
foot dorsi- and plantarflexion is full.  L IP [**4-28**], L ham 4+/5, L
quad [**5-28**], L foot dorsiflex 4+/5, L foot plantarflex [**5-28**].  There
is L pronator drift.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes brisk throughout, symmetric R=L.
The plantar reflexes are flexor.

Sensory: Sensation is [**Month/Day (1) 5235**] to pin prick, light touch,
vibration sense, and position sense in all extremities and
trunk, but there is ext to DSS over the L trunk, limbs and face.

Coordination: There is no ataxia. The finger/nose test and
finger and foot tapping are performed normally, as are rapid
alternating hand movements.

Gait:  pt declines, feels too weak to walk

Imaging:
"CT: IMPRESSION: Large mass lesion of low attenuation involving
the right temporal lobe surrounded by significant vasogenic
edema and resulting in mass effect and 10 mm midline shift to
the left with early changes of subfalcine herniation of the
brain. The findings were conveyed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 43932**] to the eemergency
room at the time of the examination. Neurosurgical consultation
is recommended with followup."

CXR: no pneumonia

Video Swallow: Poor bolus control, including aspiration of thin
liquids without spontaneous cough. Please see the report of the
speech and swallow pathologist for further information.

Pathology: R Temporoparietal mass
Note:  The tumor infiltrates predominately white matter.  The
neoplastic cells are small and round with a small amount of
cytoplasm.  Scattered tumor cells are elongated with coarse
eosinophilic processes. Immunohistochemistry is being performed
on the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and the results
will be performed in an addendum.  Glial tumor subtyping and
grading will be included in the addendum.
ADDENDUM:
Immunohistochemistry was performed and reveals a high
proliferation rate MIB-1 (Ki67) with nuclear staining in >25% of
tumor nuclei (block B,D).  HMB45 is negative.  The tumor cells
infiltrate brain and some areas are seen floating in a loose
matrix.  These latter regions show strong GFAP positive staining
of fibrillary processes (blocks B, D).  Scattered CD68 and LCA
positive cells are also present blocks (B, D).  The results are
consistent with the diagnosis of high grade malignant glioma.
Tumor necrosis and microvascular proliferation are not detected
in the small sample.  Based solely on the biopsy specimen, the
diagnosis is ANAPLASTIC ASTROCYTOMA (WHO grade III). Radiologic
studies indicate a ring-enhancing cystic mass suggesting the
possibility of higher grade tumor in unsampled parts of the
tumor.

MRI head [**2128-10-28**]: The large heterogeneous lesion with necrotic
center and irregularly nodular-enhancing periphery in the left
temporal region is again demonstrated. There is no change in the
perilesional edema and the mild shift of the midline structures.
No new lesions are noted. There is compression of the right
lateral ventricle from the mass effect. Post-biopsy changes are
noted in the right frontal region.
IMPRESSION: Large right temporal lobe necrotic GBM demonstrated
for CyberKnife procedure.
