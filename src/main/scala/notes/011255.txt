Chief Complaint:
Presyncope

Pericardial window

History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 y/o female with past medical history of
hypothyroidism presenting initially for an urgent care visit
with an episode of  diaphoresis and presyncope several hours
prior.  The patient has had ~1 month of bilateral neck
discomfort associated with mild dyspnea on exertion.  Her neck
pain improved with physical therapy and her neck pain improved.
She now reports worsening DOE and worsening neck pain over the
past 1 1/2 weeks. She now has difficulty walking up a single
flight of stairs.  Additionally, she reports that for the past
few days, she hasn't been "feeling herself", with fatigue,
nausea, vomitting, decreased PO.  On day of presentation she was
leaving work, walking to car when had acute onset of diaphoresis
and presycnope associated with SOB; no fall /headstrike.  No
palpitations.  Presented to clinic for further evaluation.  In
clinic triage noted to be tachycardic to 116.  On review of
systems she reports low grade fevers (but has been taken
ibuprofen regularly), 5 pounds of weight loss over past 2 weeks,
day&nightime sweats (and felling 'hot'), with increasing
nausea/vomitting.  She has had no lymphadenopathy, abdominal
pain, change in her bowel or bladder habits, muscle or joint
pain. Of note, on review of history had recent TSH of .088 [**7-26**],
for which she had levoxyl dose decreased and cytomel dose kept
the same.

In the ED, initial vitals were  100.0 116 126/88 18 99% Labs and
imaging significant for new anterior mediastinal mass.  She had
elevated WBC to 14.1 with 89.7%Neutrophils, Hb:10.4 plt:468.
Chem 7 wnl. TSH, FT4 pending.  D-Dimer 5515, but CTA negative
for PE.
Patient given zofran.

On arrival to the floor, patient complained of pleuritic chest
pain and intermittent nausea

PATHOLOGY

[**9-20**] pericardium, mediastinal mass biopsy

SPECIMEN #1:  PERICARDIUM, BIOPSY (A).
DIAGNOSIS:
CARDIAC MUSCLE AND FIBROADIPOSE TISSUE WITH FIBRIN DEPOSITION
AND GRANULATION TISSUE REACTION. THERE IS NO MORPHOLOGIC
EVIDENCE OF INVOLVEMENT BY LYMPHOMA.

SPECIMEN #2:  SOFT TISSUE MASS, RIGHT ANTERIOR MEDIASTINUM,
BIOPSY (B-C).
DIAGNOSIS:
DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL (THYMIC)
TYPE, SEE NOTE.

SPECIMEN #3:  SOFT TISSUE MASS, RIGHT ANTERIOR MEDIASTINUM,
BIOPSY (D-E).
DIAGNOSIS:
DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA, PRIMARY MEDIASTINAL (THYMIC)
TYPE, SEE NOTE.

Note: H&E sections (B through E) reveal fibrous tissue with
abundant geographic necrosis and infiltration by an atypical
lymphoid population in an invasive and reticulated growth
pattern with delicate interstitial fibrosis.  The tumor cells
are large with moderately abundant amphophilic cytoplasm.  The
nuclei have pale chromatin, irregular and angulated nuclear
contours, and small inconspicuous nucleoli.  Scattered mitoses
and apoptotic bodies are seen.

By immunohistochemistry, tumor cells are pan reactive with CD45
and in addition, immunoreactive for CD20 and PAX-5, with
co-expression of CD30, MUM1, and BCL-6.  The admixed reactive
T-cells are positive for CD3 and CD5.  The tumor is negative for
CD10, CD15, and CD56, which shows only rare scattered positive
cells.  The tumor cells are negative for cytokeratin cocktail
(which stains the fibroblasts), synaptophysin, S-100, and TdT.
The proliferation index, by MIB-1 staining, is approximately
80-90%.  The combined clinical, morphologic, and
immunophenotypic fi
