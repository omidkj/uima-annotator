History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3659**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with CAD, CHF (EF 40%
[**2165-3-11**]), COPD who is admitted for respiratory failure. She had a
recent admission to OSH on [**4-3**] for CHF and pneumonia. She was
treated here from [**3-9**] - [**3-18**] for NSTEMI and underwent cardiac
cath with stent placement. Per her daughter, her breathing was
labored yesterday afternoon, but was at baseline last night.
There is no report of cough or fevers from her daughter.
.
Patient was noted to be in respiratory distress at her nursing
home. She had an O2 Sat of 72% on 2LNC, which improved to 100%
on NRB. She was dypsneic, tachypneic and cyanotic. She intubated
by EMT at the nursing home and was given duonebs x 4, lasix 40 x
1, solumedrol 125 x 1 and morphine 1 mg x 1. She was noted to be
wheezing at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital and was given lasix 80 and
ertapenem. She was given ertapenem for concern for PNA.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], her vitals were T 97, HR 78, BP 151/58,
RR 18, 100% intubated. She was given vanco/levo for treatment of
pneumonia. She remained hemodynamically stable.
.
On the floor, review of sytems unable to obtain due to sedation,
intubation.

Initial CXR:
CHEST, AP: The vascular markings are slightly prominent, may be
consistent
with mild central CHF. There is ground-glass opacification in
the superior
segment of the left lower lobe. Small bilateral pleural
effusions, left
greater than right, noted.
An endotracheal tube is seen with tip 4 cm from the carina. The
osseous
structures are demineralized. The soft tissues are unremarkable.


IMPRESSION: Mild CHF. Ground-glass consolidation in superior
segment of left lower lobe may represent aspiration or
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3659**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with CAD, CHF, COPD, HTN,
admitted with respiratory failure requiring intubation likely
secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
.
1. Respiratory failure; required mechanical ventilation: Likely
secondary to CHF exacerbation given elevated BNP and history of
CHF. Most recent echo in [**3-20**] showed EF of 40% following NSTEMI.
The patient was diuresed in the ICU with IV lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **].
Fluid balance was -4.5L on ICU Day 3. She received her home
doses of hydralazine for afterload reduction and carvedilol for
beta blockade. She was sedated initially with propofol but
apneic on high doses and agitated on low doses, with several
failed SBTs. Sediation was switched to Precedex on ICU Day 2.
Patient was extubated without difficulty on ICU Day 3 with RA O2
sat 98-100%. She was changed to 80mg lasix PO BID for continued
diuresis. This was changed to 40 mg po bid on [**4-21**] due to
worsening azotemia. PNA was not suspected given her lack of
leukocytosis and lack of evidence of consolidation on CXR,
therefore empiric antibiotics that had been started on admission
were discontinued by ICU Day 1.
She is not on an ace-inhibitor due ot her renal disease. She is
not followed routinely by a cardiologist, she should likely be
seen in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic, appointment scheduled through care
connections.
Pt currently appears euvolemic, with appropriate JVP. Fluid
balance currently appears about even, but pt did not collect all
of urine.
.
2. HTN.
Contin home carvedilol, felodipine, isosorbide monoitrate,
hydralazine
.
3. Renal failure. Baseline Cr likely approx 2.4.
Pt's Cr not currently back to baseline, but pt appears
euvolemic. Suspect pt's renal function may have suffered an
insult with recent events, and it may take time to see what
amount of function she may recover. As pt currently appears
euvolemic, and is clinically doing very well, maintaining
current doses of lasix.
.
4. Anemia, CKD. Stable, at baseline.  Resume iron at discharge.
.
5. CAD. EKG with LBBB. Cardiac enzymes negative. Recent stent
placement last month. The patient ruled out for myocardial
infarction with negative cardiac enzymes and EKG. Her [**Hospital **] and
Clopidogrel were continued but her statin was held as it was not
on formulary and pt with history of multiple allergies to
statins.  Her fluvastatin will be resumed at time of discharge
with CoQ-10, as previously prescribed. Please monitor for side
effects, including myalgias on this medication.
.
7. Type 2 diabetes. Patient is diet controlled. HgA1C was 6.1 in
[**5-17**].
- treated with sliding scale insulin while inpatient; diet
controlled as an outpatient.
.
8. Hyperlipidemia. History of intolerance to many statins.
Patient's statin is not on formulary and therefore was held.
See "CAD" above for details.
