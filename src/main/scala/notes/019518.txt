ADDENDUM:  Since the previous dictation:

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  As noted previously, the
patient was transferred from an outside hospital with three
vessel coronary artery disease as noted on a diagnostic
cardiac catheterization.  The patient underwent a
preoperative workup for potential coronary artery bypass
grafting.  He was continued on aspirin.  His beta blocker and
ACE inhibitor doses were titrated up as tolerated by his
blood pressure and heart rate.  These medications were
switched to a every day regimen prior to discharge.  The
patient was also continued on a statin for
hypercholesterolemia.

As noted in the previous dictation, the patient was evaluated
with a cardiac viability study.  The patient had a cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging which demonstrated an ejection
fraction of less than 20 percent with some inferior scarring,
likely representing nonviable myocardium.  However, most of
the patient's heart - including the anterior and lateral
walls - appeared viable.  The cardiac surgeons recommended
discharging the patient to a rehabilitation facility with
followup in their office as an outpatient.  During this
follow-up appointment, the surgeons will meet with the
patient and his family members to discuss the risks and
benefits of coronary artery bypass grafting and whether or
not to proceed with the operation.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  As noted previously, the
patient was continued on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor
which were titrated up as tolerated by his heart rate and
blood pressure.  His cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was
significant for a severely depressed left ventricular
systolic function with an ejection fraction of less than 20
percent.

RHYTHM ISSUES:  The patient was monitored on telemetry
throughout his hospitalization and had occasional episodes of
premature ventricular contractions that were asymptomatic.

GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient's hematocrit
remained stable throughout the remainder of his
hospitalization.  On discharge, he was to be treated with
metronidazole, amoxicillin, and pantoprazole for a positive
serum Helicobacter pylori antibody test.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Three vessel coronary artery disease.

Congestive heart failure.

Gastrointestinal bleed.

Status post cerebrovascular accident.

Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
2. Toprol-XL 200 mg by mouth once per day.
3. Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth once per day.
4. Atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.
5. Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth twice per day (times two
   weeks).
6. Amoxicillin 1000 mg by mouth twice per day (times two
   weeks).
7. Metronidazole 500 mg by mouth twice per day (times two
   weeks).
8. Mirtazapine 50 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
9. Olanzapine 2.5 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
10.      Nortriptyline 100 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
11.      Clonazepam 0.5 mg by mouth three times per day as
   needed.
12.      Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day (after the
   patient finishes his twice per day dose for two weeks).


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP:  The patient will be
followed by the physicians at the rehabilitation facility.
He was encouraged to contact his primary care physician to
schedule [**Name Initial (PRE) **] follow-up appointment within one week after
discharge.  The patient will also be scheduled to follow up
in the Cardiac Surgery outpatient clinic to discuss a
potential coronary artery bypass grafting at a later date.
