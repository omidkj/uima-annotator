History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12367**] is a 76M with a PMH s/f DM, ventricular ependymoma
s/p craniotomy and resection [**2152**], subdural hematoma s/p
evacuation in [**2152**], who presents with acute onset of shortness
of breath, diaphoresis, and tachypnea at his nursing home.  Room
air sats at the time were in the 70s.  He was given nebulizer
treatments and EMS was called.  They placed him on a
non-rebreather, and brought him to the ED.  Of note, the patient
is a nursing home resident, and has been on a course of
levofloxacin for pneumonia. NH staff have also noticed a new
left sided weakness.
.
On presentation to the ED, vital signs were: T=104.2, BP=159/72,
HR=170, RR=30-40, 100% on a NRB.  On exam, he was noted to be
cool, pale, and diaphoretic.  The patient was sedated with
fentanyl and midazolam and intubated immediately.  Soon after
his blood pressure decreased to 104/63.  STAT labs revealed a
lactate of 7.4, and given his concurrent SIRS criteria, sepsis
protocol was initiated.  A right IJ central line was placed and
the patient recieved 6 liters of NS, 1g of vancomycin and 1g of
ceftriaxone.  Vitals at the time of sign-out were BP=97/49,
HR=119, 99% on CMV with an FiO2 of 100%.  The patient was making
urine, with a foley in place.  A head CT done in the ED showed
stable bifrontal SDH with possible subacute component on left,
unchanged in appearance from prior study, with stable post
operative changes, in addition to  chronic ethmoid and left
maxillary sinus disease.

collection remaining slightly hyperdense compared to the right,

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12367**] is a 76 year old nursing home resident who presented
with a left lower lobe pneumonia who came to the ICU with
hemodynamic instability, likely pneumosepsis, was intubated upon
arrival, then extubated on [**3-23**], transferred to medical floor.
.
1.) Respiratory failure/pneumosepsis:  Patient presented with
hypoxic respiratory failure, SIRS criteria, lacate 7.4 and left
lower lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray.
He was intubated, admitted to the intensive care unit, initially
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, volume rescusitated
with IV fluids with resolution of his elevated lactate.  His
antibiotis were weaned to zosyn alone to complete a 14 day
coruse.  He was successfully extubated with transfer to the
medical floor where he remained stable until discharge.
Of note, due to his aspiration risk, he was evaluated by speech
and swallow with modification of his diet as below.
.
2.) Acute renal failure:  The patient's Creatnine on arrival was
1.7, with resolution to baseline of 0.9-1.1 after aggressive IVF
administration, overall thought likely prerenal cause in setting
of sepsis.
.
3.) Diabetes:  His outpatient lantus, novilin, metformin were
initially held given his critically ill state, but were
restarted prior to discharge (a lower dose of lantus was
initiated as the patient's PO intake was decreased - can be
uptitrated as an outpatient).
.
4.) Hypertension:  The patient's metoprolol and lisinopril were
held initially and during his stay in the ICU.  These
medications were restarted prior to discharge.
.
5.) Nutrition:  Patient has a history of dysphagia and there was
concern for aspiration.  He was on tube feeds while intubated.
Upon extubation, speech and swallow evaluation was performed,
which allowed for softs with 1:1 supervision, which patient
tolerated.
.
6.) Code status:  confirmed DNR/DNI with his health care
proxy/gaurdian.
.
His other medical issues including his left sided hemiparesis
and history of subdural hematoma were stable during his hospital
course.
