Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Left Internal Jugular Central Line


History of Present Illness:
78 yr old female with hx of Chrohn's disease, NSTEMI, bilateral
DVTs/saddle emboli who was in her usual state of health until
day of admission when she developed a fevere to 102.9.  Pt's
daughter reports that pt had [**1-31**] day hx of a cough but no hx of
chest pain, sob, n/v/d, abd pain, dysuria, neck stiffness.  Of
note, all family memebers have been ill with various URIs in the
past month.  Pt was brought to the ED and was found to have a
temp of 99 (after tylenol) and was intermittently hypotensive
with SBPs in the 70-80 range despite 5L fluids.  The MUST
protocol was initiated and the pt was started on Levophed and
given stress dose steroids after [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**]-stim.  Pt was
transferred to the MICU for further management.
.
In the MICU, pt was weaned off levophed (after only 5 hours) and
started on ceftriaxone/azithro for presumed CAP as source of
sepsis.  Pt had a abd CT scan that showed no evidence of abd
abscess.

** CXR:

midline; no pneumothorax.
2) Faint right base/perihilar opacity, consistent with
atelectasis versus early pneumonic infiltrate.

** abd CT:
1. No evidence of intraabdominal abscess.
2. Chronic changes consistent with Crohn's disease. A few mildly
thickened loops of small bowel could be related to flare.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 78 y/o female with crohns disease on chronic
steroids presenting with cough and fever. Had persistent
hypotension in ED and was enrolled in MUST protocol, now stable
so being transferred to floor
.
1. Sepsis:  Pt's sepsis was likely secondary to pneumonia and
mild element of adrenal insufficiency (in setting of chronic
steroids for Crohn's disease) causing transient hypotensions
requiring pressors esp given bandemia, infiltrate on CXR and
rapid improvement with abx.  Pressors were discontinued soon
after arrival to the ICU with the help of fluids, initiation of
abx and steroids.  PCP was also considered given pt's
immunosuppression but unlikely given an LDH of 194.  An induced
sputum was sent for PCP and was pending at the time of
discharge.  UA negative and abd CT negative for acute pathology.
 Pt was started on Azithro/Ceftriaxone for community acquired
pneumonia.  She was given high dose steroids in the setting of
her hypotension and these were weaned down to her home dose by
the day of discharge.  She was continued on albuterol and
atrovent nebs.  Blood cx were negative.  Pt was sent home on
cefpodoxime and azithro for a total of a 10 day course.
.
2. Hypoxia: Pt required oxygen in the ICU but was never
intubated.  It was difficult to wean the pt's oxygen on the
floor due to persistent hypoxia.  A CXR showed some evidence of
failure so she was diuresed gently.  She continued to desaturate
to 87-89% on ambulation so she was discharged with home oxygen
which she will use until she is able to maintain sats >92%.
.
3. DVT/ saddle embolus: Pt with subtherapeutic INR on admission
likely secondary to missed coumadin doses during acute illness.
She was started on a heparin drip until her INR was therapeutic.
 She should have her INR closely monitored for the first several
days following discharge due to fluctuating values.  Pt's legs
have chronically been swollen since her DVTs but she was given a
few doses of lasix to aid in diuresis given the large amount
fluid the pt received while she was hypotensive.
.
4. CAD with h/o NSTEMI: Pt ruled out for MI with 3 sets of
negative cardiac enzymes.
Fasting lipids were checked and a low dose statin was started
for an LDL of 117.  Her beta blocker was titrated up as her BP
would allow.
.
5. Crohn's: Pt's steroids were tapered down to home dose of 5mg
[**Hospital1 **].  She was continued on asacol.  She was started on calcium
and vitamin D given the chronic steroids.
