HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old male with
a history of diabetes mellitus who was admitted for cardiac
catheterization. The patient has been having exertional
substernal chest pain and short of breath for months and on
the morning prior to admission experienced an episode of
chest tightness while leaving the parking lot to have his
stress test done.  The ETT which was done showed ST segment
depression in 2, 3 and AVF and V2 through V5 after 5 minutes
and 49 seconds.  The patient also had substernal chest
discomfort and short of breath which persisted resulting in
him being rushed to the [**Hospital3 **] emergency department.

On electrocardiogram there was resolution of the ST segment
abnormalities.  He received nitropaste which relieved his
symptoms.  CKMB at that hospital was 3.7, troponin were flat
and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus Type 2.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Status post right radical nephrectomy in [**2103**].
5.  Arthritis.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg q day.
2.  Hydrochloraquin 200 mg twice a day.
3.  Naproxen 37.5 mg twice a day
4.  Glyburide 2.5 mg q day.
5.  Accupril 10 mg q day.
6.  Synthroid.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He stopped tobacco in [**2090**] and has
occasional cigars.  Drinks one beer per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient's vital signs were
temperature 97.5, heart rate 65, blood pressure 127/67,
respiratory rate 20.  O2 sat 96% on two liters.  Skin was
warm, dry and icteric.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat;
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  The pupils are equal round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Positive
cataracts.  Neck supple,no bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular;  S1 and S2 regular
rate and rhythm with a harsh systolic ejection murmur
radiating to the carotids.  Abdomen obese, bowel sounds
present, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities: No
edema.  Bilateral palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses, no groin bruits.  Neurological:  Cranial
nerves II to XII grossly intact.  Rectal:  External
hemorrhoids, normal tone, guaiac negative.

On admission the patient's white blood count was 12.4,
hemoglobin 12.1, hematocrit 34.7. platelet count 247.
Prothrombin time 12.5, PTT 25.6, INR 1.0.  Urinalysis was
negative for nitrates, positive for 100 protein, sodium 142,
potassium 4.9, chloride 108, CO2 19, BUN 41, creatinine 1.7,
glucose 88.  CK was 66.

Echocardiogram by bedside done at [**Hospital3 **] showed
aortic stenosis, peak gradient greater than 25 mm of mercury.
EF of approximately 50% with borderline Left ventricular
hypertrophy.

Chest x-ray done here was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service on [**2111-7-9**] with a diagnosis of unstable angina.  He
was treated with aspirin, Lopressor, nitropaste.  Continued
on his Ace inhibitor.  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization the next day which showed no aortic valve
gradient and on coronary angiography a right dominant system
LMCA of 50% distal, Left anterior descending mild, left
circumflex 99% proximal, right coronary artery 50% proximal
and 50% distal stenosis.  Based on the above results it was
decided that coronary artery bypass graft would be necessary
and the patient preoperative workup was completed.  He was
additionally started on Heparin.  On [**2111-7-14**] the patient was
taken to the operating room where he underwent three vessel
coronary artery bypass grafting with the following grafts:
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending,
vein to OM, vein to right coronary artery under general
anesthesia.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, there
were no intraoperative complications and he was transferred
to the Cardiac Recovery Unit in normal sinus rhythm intubated
on Propofol and Neo drip.

The patient was able to be extubated the evening of the
operation and from a respiratory standpoint remained stable
throughout the rest of his postoperative course.  The patient
remained in Intensive Care Unit through the next day while he
was being weaned off his Neo drip.  He was further transfused
two units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 22
with repeat hematocrit 26.  His urine was also borderline
improving with  Lasix however, his creatinine had elevated to
2.3 from 1.7 causing his Lasix to be stopped.  This
hematocrit also decreased to 23.5 for which he received
another unit of packed red blood cells.  On postoperative day
two the patient was transferred to the regular floor after
having had his chest tubes removed.  He was closely
monitored and on postoperative day #3 was found to have some
minimal drainage from his sternotomy [**Date Range **], apparently old
serosanguinous fluid.  Sternum was stable with no clicks.
There was no erythema or induration noted.

He was empirically started on Ancef and the chest x-ray was
obtained which was negative for sternal dehiscence.  His
[**Date Range **] continued to be monitored.  On postoperative day four
the patient spiked a temperature to 103, his urine culture
found to be positive for E. coli.  He was started on
Ciprofloxacin. He was also started on Vancomycin.  His white
blood cell count was elevated to 18 and decreased the next
day to 16 and it was felt clinically that his Vancomycin
could be discontinued.  With respect to his sternal [**Date Range **] the
drainage eventually decreased and he was felt to be stable
for discharge home on postoperative day 6.  He had been
afebrile, his white count decreased to 13.3 and he was
discharged on Ciprofloxacin for his urinary tract infection.

Of note on postop day #3 the patient's BUN and creatinine
normalized to 30 and 1.8, his creatinine further decreased to
baseline of 1.6 where it stabilized.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is stable for discharge
home due to the fact that he is ambulated to a level V
remains afebrile, tolerating a regular diet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Urinary tract infection on Ciprofloxacin.
4.  Status post left nephrectomy with transient increase in
    BUN and creatinine stabilized to baseline.
5.  Diabetes mellitus Type 2.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Hypothyroidism.
8.  Arthritis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. times one week.
2.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. q 12 hours
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q day.
6.  Synthroid 25 mcg q day.
7.  Glyburide 5 mg q day.
8.  Percocet one to two p.o. q 4 to 6 hours p.r.n.
9.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q 4 to 6 hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is discharged to home
with visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] care.  He is to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35025**] in three to four weeks and to follow-up with his
primary care physician in one to two weeks.
