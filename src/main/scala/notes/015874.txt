Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, rigors

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis per outpatient schedule (M,W,F)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81M with dilated cardiomyopathy EF 25%, ESRD on
HD, and HTN recently admitted [**Date range (1) 7501**] for hungry bone syndrome
s/p parathyroidectomy. He was discharged to [**Hospital3 2558**]
[**Hospital3 **] and had been doing well with planned discharge
this am. This am, he awoke with acute onset SOB and shaking
chills associated with dry cough. He was noted to be tachycardic
to 140s with BP 230/100. He was initially 96%RA then 92% on 2L
NC but had been afebrile 98.9. He also reports weight gain 64kg
from dry weight 59kg and had bilateral hand numbness during
episode now resolved. Denies recent dietary indiscretion or CP.
He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.

In our ED, initial vs were: T102 P135 BP 221/126 R 40 O2 sat100%
on 100%NRB. He triggered for respiratory distress. Patient was
given SL NTG, started on BIPAP for presumed CHF/volume overload
but also received 500cc bolus. CXR was consistent with
multifocal PNA so he was given Vanco 1g, Zosyn 2.25g and tylenol
650mg and placed on NRB instead of BiPap with sats 100% on NRB.
Due to difficult access, left femoral line placed.

In the ICU, he reports SOB improved with no further chills or
rigors. Still complaining of dry cough.

Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI. Also reports headache this am.
(-) Denies fever, night sweats. Denies sinus tenderness,
rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:
1. ESRD
- [**2-15**] prolonged obstructive uropathy in setting of prostate CA
- hemodialysis M/W/F
- thrombectomy of avg [**12-19**]
2. Secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism with renal
osteodystrophy noted in [**2-23**] with imaging notable for
Rugger-Jersey spine. s/p sub-total parathyroidectomy [**2152-5-26**]
with persistent hypocalcemia post-op thought to be due to
'hungry-bones' syndrome.
3. Anemia related to ESRD with baseline HCT in hte mid 30s on
Epogen
4. HTN
5. Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology-last echo
[**9-21**] with EF=25%, global hypokinesis - cardiac catheterization
in [**2145**]: minor coronary irregularities
6. NSVT first noted in [**2151**]
7. Prostate CA s/p radical prostatectomy & LN dissection in 2/94


Social History:
He grew up in a [**Doctor Last Name **] family and worked in maintenance at the
Rat Cellar night club for 22 years. Prior to his last admission
in [**Month (only) 958**], he was living in senior housing and getting his meals

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2152-6-26**] 5:10
AM


PORTABLE AP SUPINE RADIOGRAPH: The left cardiac border is
obscured by an
ill-defined opacity in the left mid-to-lower lung zone. Within
this
limitation, mild cardiomegaly persists. The aorta is calcified
and tortuous again. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
unchanged. Airspace opacificationis also seen in the right
middle lobe. There may be an left pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacification is consistent with
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Alternatively
asymmetric edema or less likely pulmonary hemorrhage can explain
this radiographic appearance.
Bilateral diaphragmatic pleural calcification is probably due to
asbestos
exposure, or, less likely, other remote pleural insult.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT [**2152-6-27**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe inferior and infero-lateral hypokinesis. There is subtle
basal anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-10-4**],
the LVEF and RVEF have improved. Regional LV dysfunction is now
more evident.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Respiratory distress: Patient was requiring 100% NRB to
maintain O2 sat of 100% and had a temperature of 102 on
presentation to the ED. He was briefly on BiPAP due to concern
of flash pulmonary edema. BiPAP was subsequently stopped and he
was changed to NRB. On admission to the MICU his symptoms were
much improved and patient weaned down to 3L NC on arrival. This
was thought to be multifactorial given BNP>[**Numeric Identifier **] with weight
gain and CXR consistent with multifocal PNA as well as fever and
cough
