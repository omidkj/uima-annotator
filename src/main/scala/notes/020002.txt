Admission Date:  [**2160-10-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2160-10-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2098-11-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 212**] INTERNAL MEDICINE

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old female
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
coronary artery disease, mechanical aortic valve replacement,
and bilateral subdural hematomas in [**2160-6-22**] who was
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] where she had been since
[**2160-9-30**] following discharge from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
where she had been admitted for dyspnea on exertion of two
weeks duration.  During this hospital admission at [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital she had been diuresed for presumed congestive heart
failure and treated with nebulizers and improved
symptomatically.

However, during her stay at [**Hospital1 **] for
rehabilitation, she continued to complain of difficulty with
inspiration and expiration.  Of note, the patient had been
intubated in [**2160-5-22**] for the right-sided subdural
hematoma, as mentioned above.  She was then transferred to
the [**Hospital6 256**] for further care and
was successfully extubated and discharged in the beginning of
[**2160-6-22**].

On this presentation, the patient complains of the feeling of
something stuck in her throat as well as inspiratory
shortness of breath without chest pain.  The symptoms were
described as worsening since the first appearance
approximately five to six weeks prior to this admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bilateral subdural hematomas in [**2160-6-22**].
2.  Aortic mechanical valve replacement in [**2157-6-23**].
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Ventricular pacer.
5.  Status post PDA ligation.
6.  COPD secondary to tobacco use.
7.  Non-ST elevation MI in [**4-24**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Albuterol.
2.  Flovent.
3.  Lisinopril.
4.  Prevacid.
5.  Toprol XL.
6.  Coumadin 3 mg q.h.s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
98.3, blood pressure 107/60, heart rate 70, respiratory rate
18, saturating 97% on room air.  General:  This is a
well-developed, well-nourished middle-aged female asleep in
bed.  HEENT:  Remarkable for pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light without jugular venous distention.  A dry
oropharynx that was without other lesion.  Lungs:  There was
faint end-inspiratory stridor without wheezes.  Good air
movement throughout all lung fields.  Cardiovascular:
Prominent S1, III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the right
upper sternal border and otherwise a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  There were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses,
trace edema of the bilateral lower extremities.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The admission diagnostic studies
revealed a white blood cell count of 11.2, hematocrit 40.2,
platelets 368,000.  Sodium 141, potassium 4.7, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 33, BUN 30, creatinine 0.9, glucose 89.  PT 16,
PTT 23, INR 1.7.

A CT of the chest revealed subglottic stenosis, mild
intrathoracic tracheomalacia and multifocal air trapping
consistent with a disease airway process such as asthma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  PARTIAL AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION:  The
initial CT scan demonstrated subglottic stenosis and
potential tracheomalacia in the interthoracic trachea.  The
Otolaryngology Service and Interventional Pulmonology
Services were both consulted upon admission.  Endoscopic
examination by the otolaryngology service on [**2160-10-8**]
revealed poor vocal cord abduction and a concern for
subglottic stenosis.  The patient was scheduled for an
elective tracheostomy on [**2160-10-11**].

The patient was taken to the OR on [**2160-10-11**] by the
otolaryngology Service here at the [**Hospital6 649**] and a surgical tracheostomy was placed without
incident.  Following the operation, postoperative oozing was
noted at the trachea site and a hematocrit was ordered
revealing a drop from a preoperative level of 35 to the
postoperative level of 28.  The patient's heparin drip was
held.  The patient continued to have some oozing
postoperatively and was transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for hypotension in association with this hematocrit
drop.

She was then transferred back to the floor on [**2160-10-13**] but on
[**2160-10-15**] began to have dyspnea and the sensation of partial
airway obstruction.  A bedside endoscopy revealed granulation
tissue at the distal most aspect of the tracheostomy with
bleeding within the lumen of the trachea.  The patient was
then taken to the Operating Room on the same day with clot
removal and bronchoscopy per the Interventional Pulmonology
Team.

Postoperatively, she was taken to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, was stable from a respiratory standpoint, was
transferred back to the floor and remained without
respiratory complaint throughout the remainder of her
hospital course.

2.  AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT:  The patient's perioperative
and postoperative courses were remarkable for continued
oozing at the site of the tracheostomy.  The continued risk
for bleeding was balanced by the need for anticoagulation
given her mechanical valve.  The patient was maintained
throughout her hospitalization on a heparin drip with
fluctuating infusion rates given the need to maintain a goal
PTT of 50-60 seconds.  Throughout her course, Coumadin was
held until the [**2160-10-20**] which was initiated in anticipation
of discharge.

3.  ANEMIA:  The patient's presenting hematocrit of 40 was
likely due to a hemoconcentrated state since her baseline
hematocrits since the previous year had been closer to 30-35.
However, the patient was noted to have a Guaiac positive
stool on [**2160-10-10**] and a further laboratory examination of her
anemia revealed likely hemolytic anemia secondary to her
mechanical valve.  The patient was transfused a total of 3
units of packed red blood cells and during the final week
leading to her discharge had hematocrit stable above 35.

4.  PULMONARY:  The patient had a history of COPD and
presented with respiratory distress with symptoms of partial
airway obstruction.  The patient remained asymptomatic from
her asthma and COPD throughout the hospitalization course and
was provided with p.r.n. nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent as
needed.

5.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  As noted above, the patient was
discovered to have Guaiac positive stools on [**2160-10-10**] during
a period of time in which her PTT was supratherapeutic above
the laboratories technical limit of 150 seconds.  The
remainder of her stools were Guaiac negative.  The patient
was to arrange outpatient GI follow-up for a possible
colonoscopy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital1 **].
