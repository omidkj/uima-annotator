History of Present Illness:

having some difficulty swallowing, especially with fluids. At
dinnertime, had a coughing episode, followed by increased
difficulty breathing. He was put on oxygen by the rehab staff.
When his son came to visit him, he decided to call an ambulance
because the patient looked quite uncomfortable. En route to ED,
BPs were low, so EMTs decided to stop at [**Hospital1 **]. On arrival
to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED, vitals were 97.9 111 75/40 40 80%. Sats
down to the the 70s, so he was intubated. Had been DNR/DNI, but
the son felt that this was an acute event that would not require
long-term intubation, so he asked his father if he would be okay
with intubation and the patient consented. IVF were running and
levophed started. He had venous and arterial femoral lines
placed. He was given Flagyl, Zosyn and 5L IV fluid. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] by family request. On the floor, patient was intubated
and sedated and unable to provide further history.

CHEST X-RAY
IMPRESSION: Possible small right pleural effusion. No overt
abnormalities
including no definite pneumonia.

CT Head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo male w/ COPD and CHF, DM1 admitted to the ICU with hypoxic
respiratory failure.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Related to severe sepsis with
severe bandemia and elevated lactate. Posibly due to an
aspiration pneumonia.CXR was consistent with a pneumonia.
Antibiotic coverage for HCAP/aspiration with Vancomycin and
Zosyn was continued from OSH.
.
# Hypotension: Patient remained on norephinephrine for pressure
support until family decided to withdraw support.
.
# Acute kidney injury/oliguria: Most likely pre-renal etiology.
Elevated Creatine suggests he had been ill for longer than the
recent aspiration event.

# Decubitus ulcers: from immobilization and poor nutritional
status

Discussed poor prognosis given current infection and
comorbidities with the patient's son and daughter. They
expressed their father would not want prolonged life support.
[**Doctor Last Name 1060**], the daughter, wanted to come and see her father prior to
withdraw life sustaining support. Antibiotics, pressors, and
mechanical ventilation were continued until daughter arrived.
When both son and daughter were at bedside, the decision was
confirm to withdraw life support. He was extubated and the
norepinephrine drip stopped. He was declared dead at 1:25am on
[**2112-5-25**].
