The patient became progressively more listless and somnolent
in the ED and pressure continued to drop.  He responded to
more fluids, and also required nasal cannula 100% 02.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Initially, the patient
had a temperature of 99.2, heart rate 112, blood pressure
95/60, respiratory rate 24, saturating 100% on nasal cannula.
General:  The patient was an elderly man in no apparent
distress, awaking to voice.  HEENT: The oropharynx was clear.
The mucous membranes were dry.  The pupils were equally round
and reactive to light.  Lungs:  Clear anteriorly.  Heart:
Tachycardiac.  There was a III/VI systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No
endocarditis stigmata noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  WBC of 10.3 with 46 bands, 35.1 hematocrit,
creatinine 2.0.  Sodium 124, chloride 87.  The U/A had
greater than 50 WBCs with many bacteria.

The chest x-ray had a right pleural effusion that was old,
decreasing in size compared to previous.

The EKG had no acute ST-T wave changes, tachy, appeared to be
LVH.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  INFECTION:  Likely his hypotension was due
to sepsis secondary to UTI.  The patient also stated that he
had some instrumentation done of his heart which could also
account for his septic picture.  The patient was started on
empiric antibiotics.  Blood cultures were also obtained.  IV
fluids were given.  The patient had antibiotics of Levaquin
and clindamycin.  The patient is a DNR/DNI status.

HYPONATREMIA:  Appears to be hypovolemic.  We will place with
normal saline.  On presentation to the ICU, the patient was
already in agonal respirations.

Shortly thereafter, I was called to the room.  The patient
was asystolic and the patient was not responsive to verbal
pain or tactile stimuli. No heart sounds were heard. Pupils
were midline, dilated, not reactive.  There was a lack of
breath sounds.

The immediate cause of death was likely cardiac arrest.
Secondary cause sepsis.
