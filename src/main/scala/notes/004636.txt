Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
right lung mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy with lymph node biopsies
Laryngoscopy with vocal cord biopsy


History of Present Illness:
76F with little PMH, lifelong smoker, admitted to OSH with chest
pain, shortness of breath, and nausea; now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management of R lung and vocal cord masses.
.
She presented to [**Hospital1 392**] on [**12-6**] with the above complaints. Per
her husband, she urgently woke him up with complaints of not
being able to breathe. Also reported chest pain. Her husband
reports that though she has not specifically been complaining of
shortness of breath prior, but for at least a month prior he had
been noting that she might be dyspneic. At baseline able to
ascend a flight of stairs without clear dyspnea, though does so
slowly. He does note that she often bent her neck forward when
struggling to breath. Family has noted raspy voice for several
years without much recent change. Note frequent coughs/cold,
which she attributed to pet allergies. ROS also notable for 30#
weight loss over last 6 months despite good PO intake; also with
intermittent L leg swelling x months.
.
At OSH she received lasix, NTG, and aspirin as well as Reglan
and zofran for nausea. Her husband described that she complained
of a gagging and choking sensation that caused her to feel like
she need to throw up. She had a chest CT without PE but this did
show RLL mass. She therefore had bronchoscopy today; during the
procedure was found to have large vocal cord mass. Intubated
with 7.0 tube. Her vocal cord and endobronchial masses were both
biopsied. RIJ was also placed. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were
given for ?CAP.
.
In the MICU, the patient's antibiotics were changed to clinda
and CTX to cover necrotizing pneumonia since CT showed gas in
collapsed RLL. IP and ENT were consulted initially. Both
recommended steroids for airway edema and taking to OR for
biopsies. Patient went to OR on [**12-10**] and had biopsies of
subcarinal and mediastinal LNs. Airway edema persisted so she
was maintained on steroids. She was extubated on [**12-11**] without
difficulty. On [**12-12**] she did have some agonal breathing while
sleeping but this resolved upon awakening. ENT plans to perform
laryngoscopy to biopsy mass and assess airway edema.
.
On presentation to the floor patient had no complaints. Was
feeling well but a little sleepy (it was 11pm).
.

[**2117-12-7**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Low QRS voltage is non-specific.
[**2117-12-7**] CXR: No previous images. Endotracheal tube tip lies
approximately 3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends
well into the stomach. Right IJ catheter extends to the mid to
lower portion of the SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax. There is
some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. The left lung is clear.
There is increased opacification at the right base, most likely
consistent with effusion and atelectasis.
[**2117-12-8**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2117-12-8**] LENIs: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.
[**2117-12-9**] CT neck: 1. The subglottic lesion is not seen on this
study, which may relate to presence of the endotracheal
tube.Recommend repeat study after extubation. 2. Right pleural
effusion. 3. Emphysema.
[**2117-12-10**] LN biopsy x2: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
[**2117-12-15**] CT Torso: 1. Known heterogeneous 5.3 cm x 5.1 cm cystic
and solid mass predominantly centered within the posterior basal
segment of the right lower lobe.  Associated mediastinal and
right hilar lymph nodes as detailed above with the largest being
a subcarinal lymph node measuring up to 12 mm in short axis. 2.
Suspicious rim-enhancing foci in the spleen, the largest of
which measures 13 mm and a second focus which measures 8 mm as
detailed above. No focal liver lesions are identified. 3.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, also with fluid tracking
along the right major fissure.
[**2117-12-16**] MRI head: 1. No evidence for intracranial metastatic
disease. 2. Chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease
without acute findings. 3. Diffusely hypointense bone marrow
signal is present without focal abnormality. The findings may
relate to anemia versus a variety of other etiologies and should
be correlated with patient's history.


Brief Hospital Course:
76yo F with h/o tobacco use admitted from OSH with vocal cord
lesion - likely benign - and RLL lung mass - concerning for
squamous cell carcinoma.

#. Lung Mass: The patient presented from an outside hospital
with a lesion in her right lower lobe. The patient presented
with dyspnea. A CXR was taken which was significant for a mass
in the RLL. A CT was done which showed a cystic mass. The
patient had biopsies of the mass taken via bronchoscopy at the
OSH. The pathology of these lesions were "very concerning for
malignancy". The patient was
