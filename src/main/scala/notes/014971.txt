Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 13820**] Hospital
secondary to acute respiratory distress. Patient underwent an
emergent bronch in ED which revealed granualation tissue
occluding the proximal end of the stent. The trach was advanced
past the granualation tissue leading to a patent airway on [**12-24**].
The patient was subsequently taken by IP for a trach exchange
and stent removal. The trach was exchanged with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] 7
secured at 12 cm however the lower main stem stent was believed
to in appropriate position and was left in place on [**12-26**]. The
patient was transferred to the SICU postoperatively in stable
condition. Upon admission to the SICU patient required being on
assist control ventilation and remained in the ICU until he was
weaned to trach mask w/ stable sats.
After lengthy d/c planning sessions w/ pt's mother, arrangements
were made for pt to go home w/ extensive home services (24hr
coverage). Trach management specifically how to advance inner
cannula was shown to pt's mother and she was able to demonstrate
process well.
Patient was stable on his medication regimen and was stable from
a respiratory standpoint.
