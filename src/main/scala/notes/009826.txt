Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Known firstname 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS and generalized weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78835**] is an 80 yoM with ESRD on HD and recent E. coli
bacteremia, who presented to the ED after dialysis today with
delta MS.  The patient reportedly had symptoms of confusion and
difficulty speaking, as well as generalized weakness, beginning
around 11 am.  Per his daughter, he began to exhibit an
expressive aphasia on the way to the car, and they returned to
the HD unit where he had an EKG with ? afib/flutter.  He was
brought to [**Hospital6 33**] via EMS from the HD unit where
he had a neg NCHCT and nml FSG. He was then brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further stroke workup and possible CTA.  Neurology felt he was
severely inattentive, but had no focal deficits, c/w a
toxic-metabolic derrangement rather than a stroke.
.
In the ED, VS were initially Tmax 98.0, SBP 89-132, HR 76-95, RR
18-24, 100% 2LNC.  Lactate was noted to be 3.4, and UA was [**12-31**]
WBC, + LE, neg nit.  He was given 1LNS over several hours
(fluids given at a gentler rate b/c of his dialysis status), at
which point his SBP dropped to the 90's.  His SBP then fell to
the 80's and he was given another 500 cc bolus, with improvement
of his SBP to the 100's.  HR remained in the 70's and he was
never tachycardic.  He was given vanco/ceftriaxone for presumed
urosepsis.
.
He was also c/o abdominal pain (of several weeks duration) and
an A/P CT was obtained that showed a large, complex ventral
hernia w/o evidence of incarceration, but no other acute
pathology.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he says he is feeling "much better,"
"much less dizzy." He appears to have no word-finding or speech
production difficulties and feels these sx have resolved.  He
denies HA, change in vision, stiff neck, SOB, chest and skeletal
pain; he has had no fevers and was feeling well throughout the
week prior to HD on [**8-28**].  Per the patient, he had no episodes
of hypotension at HD.
.
Patient was transferred to the floor after he was found to be
stable in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 78835**] stated that he felt well and
no longer had any of the symptoms that had originally brought
him to the hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78835**] is an 80-year-old man with a history of ESRD,
recent bacteremia, and possible prior TIA who presented with
confusion.
.
#. AMS: Mr [**Known lastname 78837**] initial neuro exam is non focal, with only
global inattention which has resolved by arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. DDx
included encephalopathy secondary to fluid shifts duing HD,
infarction, and infection.  Imaging was negative, with no
evidence of acute infarct or vessel cutoff; there was no report
of hypotension during dialysis.  There are no gross electrolyte
abnormalities aside from his baseline uremia. Patient had
positive UA at OSH for which he was initially treated for w/
cipro, but then stopped once cultures grew diptheroids.  Patient
afebrile and w/o a leukocytosis.  No evidence of recurrent
cholangitis currently given nml LFT's.  The etiology was unclear
at discharge as Mr. [**Known lastname 78835**] was AO x3 and sharp in his
judgement.
.
# h/o TIA and CHF:  Patient was started on full dose ASA and
started on Zocor.  Additionally, patient is on low dose
metoprolol.

#. ESRD on HD: Patient on MWF schedule; patient to resume HD on
discharge. Of note, his dose of Renagel has been reduced to
800mg TID.
.
#. HTN: Patient's BP initially during course was persistently
low, but was likely secondary to HD prior to admission.  BP meds
were initially held, but BP at discharge was 110/70.  Given his
other comorbidities, Mr. [**Known lastname 78835**] was discharged on Metoprolol
Tartrate 12.5mg po qHS.

#. Indicental findings:   During course, patient's latate was
found to be elevated and CT abdomen was obtained and a small 3.2
cm right adrenal nodule found that needs to be followed up as
outpatient.  Additionally, on CT head/neck a thyroid nodule was
found that will need follow up.  Unknown clinical significance.
