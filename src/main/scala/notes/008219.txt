Patient was diffusely wheezy on exam and given solumedrol,
duonebs x 3 and started on vanc/zosyn. Patient also received
small amount of IV ativan for anxiety and 1 liter NS. CXR was
remarkable for diffuse left sided infiltrate with some volume
loss/atelectasis. Her EKG showed sinus tachycardia but was
otherwise unremarkable. Her sats improved to 98% on 10L NRB at
time of transfer with tachypnea in the 30s. Her ABG at that time

like a brick" when she coughs. No palpitations or abdominal
pain. She has a chronic indwelling Foley that fell out earlier

couple days in setting of decreased PO intake. No dysuria or
hematuria.

.
CXR [**10-28**]-MPRESSION: Diffuse left sided pneumonia. Followup to
resolution is advised.
.
CXR [**10-29**]-FINDINGS: Improving opacity within the left lung with
reduction in degree of volume loss in the left upper lobe.
Residual patchy opacities persist in the left mid and lower lung
as well as mild residual elevation of left hemidiaphragm and a
probable small left pleural effusion. Right lung is incompletely
imaged but grossly clear.
.
LENI-IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT in the left lower
extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 46 y.o female with h.o b/l foot ulcers, paraplegia due
to transverse myelitis, psychotic disorder who presented with
SOB, cough, chest pain found to have a pneumonia. Pt initially
admitted to the ICU for tachypnea and hypoxia.
.
1. community acquired bacterial pneumonia-Pt initially in the
ICU for concerns of sepsis, given tachycardia, hypoxia and
tachypnea. She was initially treated with IV vanco and
ceftriaxone. She was called out to the floor, sating 100% on RA
and antibiotics were changed to cefpodoxime and azithromycin.
Vitals signs were stable since transfer from the ICU on [**10-29**]
and patient continued to sat 100% on RA on the floor. She will
continue her antibiotics to complete a 7 day course. She should
have a repeat CXR in a few week's time to ensure resolution of
the infiltrate especially given her smoking history.
.
#chest pain NOS-chest pain resolved by the time patient was
transferred to the floor. This was thought to be MSK related to
coughing or pleuritic related to PNA. Cardiac enzymes were
negative.
.
#hypotension-Pt with SBP ranges in high 80's to low 100's. PT
reports this is her baseline. Pt was asymptomatic this admission
and remained stable in the 90's to 100's.
.
#chronic bilateral heel pressure ulcers. Wound care was
consulted and followed the patient this admission. Wound care
will continue at home.
.
#exposed L.ankle hardware-wound care followed the patient.
Orthopedics evaluated the patient and patient will continue to
follow up in the outpatient setting for continued management of
possible outpatient scheduled removal of hardware or possible
amputation. She remained afebrile and the area of concern did
not appear to be infected.
.
#coagulopathy-This was thought to be related to malnutrition
given very low albumin or possible liver disease. LFTs were
normal and patient was given 3 days of vitamin K.
.
#hypoalbuminemia/possible malnutrition-thought to be related to
same condition as above. Nutrition followed the patient and she
was given ensure supplemen
