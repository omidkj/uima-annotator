History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with history of CHF, paget's disease,
schizoaffective disorder who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
lethargy and hypotension.  With the recent death of the
patient's sister 6 weeks prior, the patient's support system
have noted an increase in the patients depression and overall
decline.  With him becoming increasingly more withdrawn and have
overall poor PO intake.  He was recently started on zyprexa and
remeron to combat these symtpoms.
 .
On the day of admission, the patient was noted to be very
lethergic and minimally responsive, in contrast to his baseline
of [**Location (un) 1131**] the [**Location (un) **] globe and participating in activities.  A
chest XR was ordred showing a question pneumonia, and  his blood
pressure was in the 70s.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
On arrival, the patients vitals were 97.5, BP 120/50, HR 86,
100% on NRB.  His blood pressures fell to 85/60 during his ED
course, which responded to fluids.  A CXR confired suspicision
of PNA, and CTX, levo, and flagyl were given.  He was given 3L
of NS for volume resussitation, a CVL was placed.  The patient
reportedly had RUQ tenderness on exam, a CT scan of abd/pelvis
was obtained, and a surgery consult was requested.  There was no
acute surgical issues identified, and the patient was admitted
to medicine for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old male with a history of
CVA admitted initially to the MICU for pneumonia and hypotension
secondary to pneumonia with sepsis versus aspiration pneumonia
and profound hypovolemia.
.
Pneumonia.  Patient presented with infiltrate on CXR with
leukocytosis and left shift.  He initialy required 5L O2 by NC
which was titrated down to room air.  Pneumonia was likely
aspiration pneumonia versus hospital acquired pneumonia as
patient is a [**Hospital 100**] Rehab resident. He was initially treated
with levaquin, ceftriaxone and flagyl, but this was switched to
zosyn.  He will complete a 2 week course on [**6-10**]/[**2106**].
.
Hypotension.  Patient presented with hypotension and required
levophed to maintain blood pressure initially.  Most likely
cause of hypotension was secondary to hypovolemia, however,
there was concern for sepsis in setting of pneumonia.  He was
given IVFs and his hypotension improved.
.
Hypernatremia.  Hypernatremia likely secondary to poor PO intake
in setting of somnolence.  He was given free water flushes and
D5W and his sodium normalized.  He will need free water flushes
and D5W until patient is more awake and able to take POs.
.
Lethargy.  Lethargy is likely multifactorial due to depression,
oversedation from psychiatric medications, hypernatremia, and
pneumonia.  Patient remained somnolent on discharge.  His
psychiatric meds were held during the majority of his stay and
will need to be resumed when more awake. Family feels strongly
that zyprexa improves patient's lethargy, had several
discussions explaining that lethargy is a common side effect and
why it was held.
.
Pre-renal acute renal failure.  Patient presented with
hypotension and pre-renal ARF which resolved with fluids.  Most
likely secondary to poor PO intake, however, sepsis was a
possibility.
.
Nutrition: High risk of aspiration. Patient too sedated to be
assesed by speech and swallow this admission. Currently with
dobhoff for tube feeds. Patient pulled out two dobhoff's -
currently with mitts to prevent pulling out. Once patient is
more alert will need to be assesed by speech and swallow. If
fails long term plan will need to be addressed with HCP (peg vs.
po with aspiration risk).
.
Hypothyroidism.  Patient continued on synthroid.  TSH was normal
but free T4 was slightly low.  No adjustments to his synthroid
dose were made.
.
H/o CVA. Patient remained on Aspirin 81mg.  He has right upper
extremity weakness due to CVA and is wheelchair bound at
baseline.
.
Schizoaffective disorder. Patient is on Wellbutrin, zyprexa, and
remeron as outpatient.  All of these were held in setting of
altered mental status. These should be resumed on an outpatient
basis.
.
ACCESS: Left PICC.
.
CODE STATUS: DNR but okay to intubate.
