Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
carotid stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right ICA stent


History of Present Illness:
71 year old woman with a complicated medical history including
but not limited to CAD s/p recent PCI, aortic stenosis,
Diabetes, HTN and carotid artery disease who was referred for
right carotid angiography and possible intervention. Per pt, her
ophthalmologist had noticed something in her left eye while
evaluating her for slowly decreasing visual acuity in that eye.
She was then referred byt her PCP for bilateral carotid
ultrasounds that revealed peak internal carotid artery
velocities on the right of 437/98 and on the left of 340/60
cm/sec with ratios of greater than 7 on the right and
approximately 2 on the left. From a neurovascular standpoint,
she has been asymptomatic and neurologically intact. She denies
any symptoms of amaurosis [**Last Name (LF) 64735**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] motor or sensory changes,
or any expressive or receptive aphasias.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock pain but does note LE
cramps after walking [**11-18**] block; no rest Sx. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
but she does have stable dyspnea on exertion, w/o paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, recent ankle edema, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.
.

RCA, two bare metal stents to distal RCA)

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**1-20**] demonstrated:
1. Selective coronary angiography of the right coronary artery
demonstrated a tortuous and mildly calcified artery with an 80%
ostial lesion, a mid vessel 90% lesion, and a distal 80% lesion.

2. Successful PCI of the ostial RCA (3.0 x 18 mm Cypher DES,
post-dilated with a 3.5 mm balloon), the mid-RCA (3.0 x 13 mm
Cypher DES), and the distal RCA (two overlapping 2.5 x 12 mm
Minivisions, post-dilated with a 2.75 mm balloon).
3. Right femoral angiography demonstrated diffuse disease in the
right external iliac artery/common femoral artery of up to
50-60%.
.
HEMODYNAMICS:
.
[**3-23**] carotid u/s: severe heterogenous calcified plaquing in
both carotid systems. Flow velocities in the right ICA suggest a

91-99% ICA stenosis. Flow velocities in the left ICA suggest a
71-90% ICA stenosis. Bilateral severe ECA stenosis. Vertebral
flow is antegrade on the right and retrograde on the left
suggestive of possible left sided subclavian stenosis.
.
[**2193-10-7**] echo: normal LVEF of 60%. Aortic stenosis with a mean
gradient of 36 mmHG. 1+ MR. Doppler evidence of diastolic
dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 71 year old woman with a complicated medical
history including but not limited to CAD s/p recent PCI, aortic
stenosis, Diabetes, HTN and carotid artery disease who was
referred for right carotid angiography and possible
intervention. On [**5-11**] the patient underwent stenting of her
right carotid artery and tolerated the procedure well. Metformin
was held prior to the procedure due to the dye load; she was
continued on glyburide while she was taking PO's and covered
with Humalog sliding scale. Avandia was also held given concern
for increased risk of [**Doctor First Name **] after the intervention. Atenolol was
held after the procedure due to increased vagal tone post
carotid stenting and was restarted upon discharge. After the
procedure she was treated with neosynephrine to maintain SBP
80-130 per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] recommendations given large discrepancy in
pressure between peripheral cuff pressures and aortic pressure;
this was weaned as tolerated. Frequent neuro exams were
performed without any abnormalities. The patient did not display
any signs or symptoms suggestive of cerebral ischemia or embolic
phenomenon.

While in the hospital the patient was continued on ASA, statin,
and plavix. She remained in NSR with no concerning changes on
telemetry monitoring.

The patient was maintained on a PPI and remaining outpatient
medications for the duration of admission.
