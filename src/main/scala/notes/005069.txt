Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left heart cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year-old with no known past medical history who
developed chest pressure and tightness with associated
exertional dyspnea while on the elliptical machine on Saturday
(3-days prior) with pain that persisted through the evening. The
pain resolved the following day at first, but then
intermittently returned. The morning of admission ([**2104-12-2**]), he
awoke with persistent chest pressure, resting dyspnea and
diaphoresis; his sister encouraged him to seek medical
treatment.
.
He presented to [**Hospital3 **] ED with initial VS 98.8 95
138/96 18 97% RA. He was complaining of [**3-23**] chest discomfort
with some resting dyspnea. An EKG showed NSR @ 92, NA/NI,
ST-elevations in leads V4-6, and in leads II, III, aVF -
inferolateral ST-changes. CXR showed no acute intrapulmonary
process. Laboratory studies showed a Troponin-I of 22.83, CK
565. Creatinine 1.3. WBC 13.7 with HCT 46.7%. INR 1.2. Patient
was given Nitro ointment 1-inch, Aspirin 324 mg PO x 1, Plavix
loaded with 600 mg and Atorvastatin 80 mg PO x 1. He was Heparin
loaded with 4000 units and started on a continuous gtt.
Metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3-doses was administered. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
The patient was urgently transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] cardiac cath
lab given concern for an inferiorlateral STEMI. On cath, he was
noted to have an occluded large RPL branch and the vessel was
unable to be opened successfully (technically unsuccessful) via
RRA access. The patient transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**]-Cardiology floor
and upon transfer was found unresponsive with cold, mottled
extremities. His BP was 60/palp (initially 120s systolic) with a
HR of 57-80s and stable O2 saturations 98% 2L NC. By the time
the resident arrived, he was alert, awake and mentating. The
Cardiology fellow evaluated him a recommended Atropine 1 mg IV x
1 for presumed vasovagal episodes, with HR increase to the low
90s. He was given 1L NS IV x 1. A bedside 2D-Echo showed
evidence of a 1-1.5-cm pericardial effusion with evidence of
poor RV filling and possible tamponade physiology. An ABG showed
7.44/29/104 with a lactate of 1.0.
.
He was transferred to CVICU, patient is mentating well, alert
and interactive without lightheadedness or dizziness. He denies
chest pain, trouble breathin, no palpitations, nausea or
diaphoresis.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope currently.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. They deny bleeding at
the time of prior procedures or surgeries. Denies headaches or
vision changes. No cough or upper respiratory symptoms. Denies
chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness; no palpitations.
Denies shortness of breath. No nausea or vomiting, denies
abdominal pain. No dysuria or hematuria. No change in bowel
movements or bloody stools. Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or
neurologic complaints. No exertional buttock or calf pain.

[**2104-12-2**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM FOCUSED STUDY: There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the inferior wall and severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral
wall, basal to mid inferior septum, and apex. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. No right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality.Regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Moderate-sized,
echodense pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
evidence of frank tamponade physiology.
.
[**2104-12-3**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM FOCUSED STUDY TO COMPARE TO EARLIER TTE:
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focal severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior wall,
inferolateral wall, inferoseptum, and apex. The remaining
segments contract well. (EF 30-35%). There are three aortic
valve leaflets. There is a moderate to
