Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension/tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT guided drainage of abscess

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 64y/o WF w/ a PMH of crohn's disease (c/b sigmovaginal
fistula s/p ileostomy), CAD (s/p recent anteroseptal MI in
[**4-26**]), and a recent admission for VRE/MRSA bacteremia c/b
endocarditis who was admitted today after being found to be
hypotensive and tachcardic at her [**Hospital **] clinic follow-up.

The patient was recently admitted from [**2104-6-25**] to [**2104-8-2**] for
management of her sigmo-vaginal fistula.  During this
hospitalization, she received a diverting ileostomy but her
course was complicated by severe hypotension that was eventually
attributed to both VRE/MRSA bacteremia along with adrenal
insufficiency.  She required several ICU stay during her last
admission and was treated widely with antibiotics.  A TEE during
her hospitalization showed some evidence of endocarditis and the
patient was eventually d/c to rehab to complete a 6wk course of
daptomycin and a prednisone taper (from stress steroids started
[**1-24**] adrenal insufficiency).  She finished her daptomycin course
last week (1st day [**2104-7-19**]) but was on 10mg of prednisone until
the day of admission.

On the day of admission, the patient was transported to her f/u
ID appointment.  There, she was noted to be tachycardic to 120,
hypothermic at 96.5, and with a BP of 100/palp while lying flat.
 She was sent to the ED for further w/u and treatment.  In the
ED, she maintained her SBP between 80-110 with a total of 2L of
NS boluses.  She complained of lower abdominal pain initially
but this this resolved once her ostomy bag was emptied.  She
spiked a temperature to 103 in the ED and was broadly covered
with cefepime/daptomycin/flagyl as well as dexamethasone.  She
was admitted to the ICU for further managment.

In the ICU, she was afebrile and her BP was >90.  She was not
tachycardic and denied any abdominal pain, CP, or SOB.  She
denied any recent fevers or chills and did not have any nausea.
Nursing at her rehab stated that she appeared well this AM and
did not voice any complaints.

IMAGING:

CXR ([**2104-9-9**]):
Mild congestive heart failure and bilateral pleural effusions.
Left retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis or pneumonia.

CT ([**2104-9-9**]):
1. Fluid collection in pouch of [**Location (un) **]. It is uncertain whether
this is within bowel if there has been prior surgical
correction, or whether this represents an abscess from the
patient's known rectovaginal fistula. Further evaluation via
pelvic CT scanning with water-soluble rectal contrast is
recommended.
2. Diffuse anasarca.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis or
consolidation in both lower lobes.
4. Cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

Echo ([**2104-9-10**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular  systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen
(cannot exclude).

CT guided drainage ([**2104-9-11**]):
Successful CT guided drainage of perirectal abscess. The
catheter was left to bag drainage. 40 cc of purulent material
was aspirated.

PICC placement ([**2104-9-17**]):
Successful placement of a 36 cm long double lumen line placed
via the left brachial vein with the tip in the distal part of
the SVC. The line is ready for use.

CT drainage study ([**2104-9-19**]):
Constellation of findings suggests no fistulous connection
between the rectum and vagina. Persistent communication of
extraperitoneal space and colon.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64y/o F w/ Crohns disease c/b rectovaginal fistula,
unrepaired, s/p diverting ileostomy, w/ recent hospitalization
c/b MRSA/VRE bacteremia and endocarditis.  Now s/p 6wk course of
daptomycin and admitted w/ hypotension and fever.

1. Sepsis/Perirectal abscess:
The patient presented with a history of multiple recent
admissions for infections and was at the time off antibiotics.
Her UA was clean but a CXR showed a possible PNA.  She was
previously adrenally insufficient and was on chronic steroids
per OSH.

On arrival to MICU she was started on daptomycin/cefepime/flagyl
for empiric coverage and stress dose steroids (including
florinef).  She received IVF boluses to maintain CVP>10 and
required norepinephrine to maintain MAPs >65, titrated off on
[**9-11**].  Possible sources initially unclear:  as above, UA was
unremarkable and CXR showed possible PNA; a TTE was also
unrevealing (although prior vegetation only noted on TEE).  A CT
revealed pelvic collection, unrelated to rectum.  On [**9-11**], she
underwent CT guided drainage.

After this interventions, she improved dramatically and was
transfered to the floor - at that time her blood pressures were
stable and was diuresing well.  She was continued on empiric
antibiotics until abscess culture data returned.  It eventually
polymicrobial, including both MRSA and pseudomonas.  Given her
vancomycin allergy and her improvement with abscess drainage, ID
was consulted regarding duratio
