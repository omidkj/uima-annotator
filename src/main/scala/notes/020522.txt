CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2132-1-22**] 9:20 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o PNA. check trach position.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with trach, reinserted after dislodgement.
copious secretions.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PNA. check trach position.
CHEST, ONE VIEW, PORTABLE

INDICATION: 64-year-old man with tracheostomy secretion, rule
out pneumonia.

COMMENTS: Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest is
reviewed, and compared with the previous study of [**2132-1-14**].

The tracheostomy tube is seen in place. There are fixation dots
overlying the upper thoracic spine. The patient has prior CABG
and median sternotomy.

The lungs are clear. The heart is normal in size.

IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2132-1-16**] 3:12 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: please do ct abd and pelvis with iv contrast r/o
abscess. Pt
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man s/p fall, multiple fractures, VAP . Now with
persistent fever
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please do ct abd and pelvis with iv contrast r/o abscess. Pt
with persistent fevers
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 54-year-old man status post fall with multiple
fractures. Evaluate for persistent fever. Rule out abscess.

COMPARISON: CT torso [**2132-1-3**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis
were obtained with intravenous contrast. Multiplanar
reformations were performed.

CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Bilaterally there has been
an interval decrease in size of pleural effusions. The
previously seen bilateral patchy opacifications, predominantly
within the lower lobes are markedly reduced, suggesting
resolution of prior infectious process/aspiration pneumonia. The
mediastinum is unchanged, the patient is intubated with
tracheostomy. Multiple surgical clips are again noted along the
anterior mediastinum and anterior chest wall.

There is a small amount of perihepatic fluid. The liver is
otherwise unremarkable. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, right
adrenal gland, and kidneys are within normal limits. There is a
punctate low-attenuation lesion within the lower pole of the
right and left kidneys, too small to characterize. There is a
1.3 x 1.1 cms soft tissue density nodule within the left adrenal
gland. The small bowel and large bowel are unremarkable. A PEG
is in place within the stomach. No abscesses or focal fluid
collections are seen within the peritoneum. An IVC filter is
again noted in place.

CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder is catheterized and unremarkable.
The prostate, sigmoid colon are within normal limits. There is
no free fluid. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes
within the abdomen and pelvis.

BONE WINDOWS: Within the left iliac bone adjacent to the SI
joint, there is a focal low-attenuation mass, likely
representing prior location of bone graft. Interval decrease in
attenuation of this lesion, suggests likely resolving hematoma,
however, cannot rule out infectious etiology. Spinal rods are
again noted in the upper thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval reduction in bilateral pleural effusions with small
residual left pleural effusion.
2. Interval reduction in patchy airspace consolidation
bilaterally especially within the left lower lobe, suggesting
resolution of prior infectious etiology/aspiration pneumonia.
3. Small left adrenal nodule, unable to completely characterize,
due to lack of noncontrast exam.
4. Left iliac low-attenuation lesion, most likely site of bone
graft, now with interval decrease in attenuation, likely
resolving hematoma, cannot rule out infection.
