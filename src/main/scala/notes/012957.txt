History of Present Illness:
60 year old woman with immunodeficiency on IVIG, COPD,
dyslipidemia, possible history of CVA, tobacco abuse and DM2 was
found unresponsive in bed on the morning of admission. History
was obtained from medical records and from son. The pt was not
answering phonecalls from her friend and on the morning of
admission and was found to be unresponsive in her bed. The pt's
last known contact with her was the previous day but the son was
unclear about the time. The pt was found to be slightly confused
during the 5 days prior to admission according to her friend.
She was unable to write her checks and had asked for the
friend's help with writing them. No known complaints by the
patient. She had visited her doctor approximately 10 days prior
to admission after a fall and was told that she might have had a
stroke and her physician advised her to get more tests.  On the
day of admission the pt was taken to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where her
temp was 102.1. She had a CT of the head which revealed a
possibe left frontal abscess. She was intubated for airway
proctection and a central line was placed. She was given
vancomycin 1 gram IV, zosyn 3.375 IV, flagyl 500 IV, sedated,
and given paralytics prior to intubation. She was also treated
for hyperkalemia. At [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital the pt also received 1 L of
NS. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup of the
possible frontal brain abscess.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED the pt's vitals were T 99.1 BP 115/59 HR 95 RR 27
95% intubated AC TV 500 FIO2 50% PEEP 5. Patient received 2
grams of IV ceftriaxone.
.
On arrival to MICU her vitals were T 98 HR 78 BP 118/92 RR 15
100% on AC TV 500 PEEP 5 FiO2 60%. Neurology was consulted who
felt that her CT head changes were secondary to prior surgery,
which after discussion with the pt's family turned out to be
true as the pt had had prior intracranial surgery for removal of
a granuloma related histiocytosis X.

.
Echo: TTE The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with normal regional and global
biventricular systolic function. No pathologic valvular
abnormality seen.
.
MRA MRI brain IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral T2 hyperintense cerebellar lesions and
corresponding abnormal
signal intensity in the diffusion-weighted images with mild low
signal in the
ADC map. These findings likely represent subacute infarction.
The pattern
suggest embolic infarction.
2. Questionable narrowing involving both PICA's.
3. Sinus disease as described above.
.
US abd: Normal scan and Doppler examination of the hepatic and
portal veins and main
hepatic artery.
.
TEE: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
Overall left ventricular systolic function and size are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are extensive complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch and descending aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic, pulmonary, tricuspid, or mitral valve. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac thrombus. No valvular vegetations.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old woman with immunodeficiency on IVIG, COPD,
dyslipidemia, tobacco abuse and diabetes who was admitted after
being found unresponsive.
.
During this admission the following issues were addressed:
.
# Altered Mental status:  The pt was intubated at an outside
hospital for airway protection.  Her chest xray was not
suspicous for intrapulmonary process. On the morning following
admission the pt's mental status improved and she was extubated
without diffculty. The patient was originially thought to have
bilateral cerebellar [**Doctor Last Name 6056**]. However, per the neurology
consultation service, it would be unusual to have simultaneous
bilateral cerebellar strokes causing loss of consciousness. It
is more likely that the findings seen on MR of the brain are old
cerebellar strokes. The pt was found to have a UTI on
urinanalysis and her altered mental status was presumed to be
due to delirium secondary to
