CT LOW EXT W/O C RIGHT

Reason: r/o fx tib plateau

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
41 year old man with motorcycle
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o fx tib plateau
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Motorcycle accident, rule out tibial plateau fracture.

TECHNIQUE:

Thin section axial images were obtained from the distal femur
through the mid calf and reconstructed using both bone and soft
tissue algorithm. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were also
generated. The patient's leg is imaged in slight flexion,
resulting in some distortion of the axial images presently
available.

RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY, WITHOUT CONTRAST:

PRELIMINARY WET [**Location (un) **]:

Please note that a wet [**Location (un) 1131**] was provided by the radiology
resident on the PACS requisition as follows: "extensively
comminuted tibial plateau fracture involving joint surface with
hematoma and deep tissue air. Comminuted proximal fibular
fracture (spiral). Discussed with trauma team (by resident
[**Doctor Last Name **], M,"

FINAL REPORT:

There is a markedly comminuted fracture of the proximal tibia,
extending into the tibial plateau, with considerable axial
dispersion of the fracture fragments. The articular surface
components extend into the lateral plateau, into the tibial
eminence, and into the medial tibial plateau. The distal major
fracture lines exit in the medial and lateral metaphyses, with
comminution. There is dispersion of fragments posteriorly, with
small fragments lying adjacent to the popliteal vessels, though
they do not appear to directly impinge on the vessels (series 2,
images 139-117). The main longitudinal axis of the tibial shaft
is displaced posteriorly with respect to the markedly comminuted
proximal tibia, best appreciated on sagittal views. The tibial
tubercle (insertion site of patellar tendon) is avulsed. There
is also considerable comminution at the expected insertion site
of the posterior cruciate ligament. The ACL is not effectively
evaluated here.

There is a joint effusion, with air within the joint. There is
extensive surrounding soft tissue edema as well as some
subcutaneous emphysema.

There is a comminuted fracture of the proximal diaphysis of the
fibula. The proximal tibiofibular joint remains congruent.

IMPRESSION:

1. Markedly comminuted and impacted fracture of the proximal
tibia, with extensive involvement of the tibial plateau and
posterior displacement of the main shaft of the tibia. Avulsion
of patellar tendon from tibial tubercle. Comminution at expected
site of PCL insertion. Bony fragments abutting the popliteal
vessels.

2. Proximal fibular diaphyseal fracture.

Reason: r/o Fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
41 year old man with motorcycle
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o Fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

ADDENDUM: The findings regarding T4 fracture was communicated to
the covering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 58703**], by telephone at 9:30 p.m. on
[**2152-6-12**]. We tried to reach the ordering physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) **], however, was not successful, and therefore, the
information was also sent to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] by e-mail.
INDICATION: 41-year-old male with motorcycle.

C-SPINE CT WITHOUT CONTRAST.

No comparison.

FINDINGS: Note is made of severe scoliosis, however, there is no
gross fracture or dislocation. No prevertebral soft tissue
swelling.

IMPRESSION: Marked scoliosis. No gross fracture or dislocation.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a compression fracture
of T4, with retropulsion of an inferior endplate fragment. CT is
extremely limit
