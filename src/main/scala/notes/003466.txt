IMAGING:
[**2146-2-28**] 12:28 PM CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Interval removal of left basal chest tube with small
pneumothorax. Persistent left lower lobe atelectasis. Short-term
radiographic follow-up of the small pneumothorax is recommended.

.
[**2146-2-28**] MR CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST
1. Prevertebral fluid/soft tissue thickening extending from the

atlanto-occipital articulation to the C4 vertebral body with
signal
abnormality involving the interspinous ligaments at C3-4. Slight
anterior step-off of C4 on C5 is likely degenerative in nature.
No cord signal abnormality identified.
2. Minimal degenerative changes of the cervical spine as
described above without evidence of spinal canal or neural
foraminal narrowing at any level.
3. Asymmetric prominence of the left thyroid lobe. Recommend
clinical
correlation.
.
[**2146-2-27**] BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
Grayscale and color Doppler ultrasounds were performed. There is
a non-occlusive thrombus in the right common femoral veins. The
right common femoral as well as the superficial femoral veins
bilaterally and the popliteal veins bilaterally are unremarkable
and show normal color flow, compressibility and Doppler signal.
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive clot in the right common femoral
veins.
.
[**2146-2-26**] UGI SGL CONTRAST W/ KUB
No evidence of contrast extravasation along the course of the
esophagus.
.
[**2146-2-25**] HAND (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT
Left forearm two views and three views of the left wrist
demonstrate fractures involving the base of the proximal phalanx
of the ring finger and to the third metacarpal head. There is
also a small fracture off the ulnar styloid. There is
irregularity of the radial styloid with suggestion of the small
nondisplaced fracture which exits out the lateral articular
surface, best seen on the oblique view. Degenerative changes of
the first CMC and triscaphe joint are noted. Images of the
forearm demonstrate no fractures in the region of the ulnar
radial shaft or in the region of the elbow.
.
[**2146-2-25**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
1. Left-sided chest tube has been pulled back. Subcutaneous
emphysema on that side.
2. Right upper lobe volume loss.
.
[**2146-2-25**] TIB/FIB (AP & LAT) LEFT
Patient is status post left total knee arthroplasty. There are
no signs of hardware-related complications. There is a fracture
dislocation of the ankle with a vertically oriented fracture
through the medial malleolus and a transversely oriented
fracture through the lateral malleolus, 1.5 cm above the
tibiotalar joint. There is abnormal widening of the ankle
mortise suggesting a syndesmotic ligament and injury. Dedicated
images of the left foot show no displaced fractures. The base of
the fifth metatarsal is intact. There is bipartite tibial and
fibular sesamoids.
.
[**2146-2-25**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. No fracture or hemorrhage. 2. Large subgaleal hematoma at the
cranial vertex, with numerous skin lacerations.
.
[**2146-2-25**] CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST
1. Extensive left-sided rib fractures, pneumomediastinum,
subcutaneous emphysema and loculated pneumothorax. 2. Pulmonary
contusion and areas of atelectasis or aspiration. 3.
Malpositioned left chest tube in the posterior mediastinum
between the esophagus and aorta at the level of T9. Removal is
highly recommended given the extreme proximity to the aorta and
heart. 4. Acute pulmonary embolus in left lower lobar artery. 5.
Left transverse process fracture of L1 and possibly L2.
.
[**2146-2-25**] CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
1. No fracture or malalignment.
2. Moderate degenerative change of the cervical spine.
3. Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumomediastinum
better evaluated on concurrent CT torso. Numerous left-sided rib
fractures, the most displaced being left 9th ribfracture.
Pneumomediastinum, small left pneumothorax, no tension.
Leftlower lobar pulmonary artery somewhat eccentric filling
defect; may represent non-acute pulmonary embolus.
.



Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Her head and cervical
spine imaging studies did not reveal any acute injuries. CT
imaging of her chest however revealed an acute pulmonary embolus
in left lower lobar artery; a lower extremity ultrasound was
done to evaluate for thrombus which showed a non-occlusive clot
in the right common femoral veins.

Orthopedics was consulted and she was taken to the operating
room on [**2-26**] for repair of her left ankle bimalleolar fracture
with shear medial tibia fracture. Her weight bearing status on
her left leg is touchdown on the toes only. She will remain in
the splint until follow up in 2 weeks in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic.

On [**2-27**] she was taken back to the OR for an IVC filter
placement. Postoperatively she was taken to the Trauma ICU for
close monitoring.

Plastics was consulted for the open fractures to left hand and
large open dorsal wound. The wound was irrigated extensively;
wound edges approximated with 4-0 Ethilon and Prolene
interrupted sutures. The wound was dressed and splinted. She
will follow up as an outpatient in Plastic's clinic with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]. She is to remain non weight bearing on her left upper
extremity until cleared by Plastics.

She was also evaluated by the Acute Pain service for thoracic
epidural catheter given her multiple rib fractures. Intravenous
Fentanyl was also added. The epidural catheter unfortunately
dislodged and was removed. She was then started on an IV and
oral pain regimen requiring several adjustments. Currently she
is on standing Tylenol and Oxycodone [**9-2**] every 3 hours prn. An
aggressive bowel regimen is in place.

Hematology was consulted for concern re: hypercoagulability
given the pulmonary embolus and DVT found on imaging at time of
admission. It was noted by Hematology that the inferior vena
cava filter o
