Allergies:
Motrin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: tachycardia, lethargy


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/p L shoulder hemiarthroplasty
S/p placement of central line


History of Present Illness:
.
HPI: 81 y/o F with COPD, HTN, PAF, h/o CVA, breast CA who
presented to ED s/p mechanical fall this morning. Per pt's
daughter, pt tripped and fell in a pool of water unwitnessed and
pressed call-alert to contact EMS who contact[**Name (NI) **] her daughter.
The pt's daughter called EMS and pt was brought to ED. Per
report by ED and pt's daughters, pt was alert and oriented and
manifesting significant pain, but by the time of my exam, pt was
somnolent and could not provide a history.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was given morphine 2 mg IV and dilaudid IV because she
was in severe pain which subsequently caused her to be
somnolent. Pt was also given Lopressor 5 mg IV x 3 for her
tachycardia with subsequent HR in 110-120 and ASA. EKG showed [**Street Address(2) 13234**] depressions in V3-V5, II, AVF. CT C-spine was negative for
fracture. CT head showed no bleed. L shoulder X ray showed
comminuted fx and dislocation of L humeral head and humerus. R
hand and wrist X rays showed no fx. CT abdomen was ordered by ED
to r/o bleed in abdomen and pelvis to otherwise explain
tachycardia which was negative except for evidence of L1
compression fx, new since CT [**2-/2103**] but cannot determine if
acute or chronic (no findings in adjacent soft tissue to suggest
acute). Ortho trauma was consulted in ED but was unable to
perform full exam secondary to pt's lethargy. Given pt's
somnolence and persistent tachycardia, pt was admitted to MICU
for further monitoring.
.
ROS: pt unable to give history, but family states that pt had
been complaining of increasing lower back pain recently and also
had more difficulty performing ADLs.
.

Labs: see below
.
Studies:
CT head: no hemorrhage, no fracture; slight mucosal thickening
in
the left maxillary sinus versus small fluid.
.
CT C-spine: no fracture
.
L shoulder X ray: There is a comminuted fracture dislocation of
the
left humeral head and left humerus. The humeral head is
dislocated inferiorly and medially from the glenoid fossa. A
second fragment composed of the lesser and greater tuberosities
lies within the glenoid fossa. The distal humeral fragment
dislocated medially and inferiorly. There is soft tissue
swelling.
IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted fracture dislocation of the left humeral head and
the humerus.
.
Right hand and wrist X ray: 1. Diffuse osteopenia. 2. No
evidence of fracture.
.
CXR: no cardiopulmonary process; L complex humeral fx
dislocation
.
Pelvis AP: minimally displaced L subcapital fx
.
CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Compressed fracture of L1. Clinical correlation is
recommended for
evaluation of acute or chronic character of this fracture.
2. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air or fluid.
3. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
4. Large hiatal hernia.
.
EKG: sinus tachy at 110, ST depressions 1 mm in V3-V5, II, AVF,
nl axis and nl intervals
*
[**2106-4-15**] CTA
MPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Large hiatal hernia.
3. Emphysematous change. Atelectasis and effusion.
4. Comminuted and displaced fracture of the left humeral head
with hematoma, as noted on the prior x-ray.
*
[**4-17**] chest AP
A right internal jugular vascular catheter remains in place,
terminating at the junction of the superior vena cava and right
atrium. There is focal bending or kinking of the catheter at the
skin insertion site region. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable with a very large hiatal hernia. Small bilateral pleural
effusions and left retrocardiac opacity are again demonstrated
without significant interval change.
*
3-24 L shoulder AP
Left shoulder arthroplasty seen within the glenoid joint on one
view. Arthroplasty position not well evaluated on other view.
Greater tuberosity fragment is again identified. Bones appear
diffusely osteopenic.

[**2106-4-17**]
CXR: AP
A right internal jugular vascular catheter remains in place,
terminating at the junction of the superior vena cava and right
atrium. There is focal bending or kinking of the catheter at the
skin insertion site region. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable with a very large hiatal hernia. Small bilateral pleural
effusions and left retrocardiac opacity are again demonstrated
without significant interval change.

Sinus rhythm
Modest diffuse low amplitude T waves with borderline
prolonged/upper limits of normal Q-Tc interval - are nonspecific
but clinical correlation is suggested for possible
drug/metabolic/electrolyte effect Since previous tracing of
[**2106-4-16**], precordial lead T wave amplitude but may be no
significant change
