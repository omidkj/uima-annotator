admission for hepatic encephalopathy. During that admission her
TIPS was found to be patent on doppler.

foley was placed. She was intubated for airway protection with a
#7.0 ETT with etomidate and rocuronium.  An OGT was placed and
both ETT and OGT were confirmed in good position by CXR.  She
was sedated with propofol. Post intubated she was hypertensive
to 213/130 but normalized without directed antihypertensives.
She also received 1L of NS, kayexalete/glucose/insulin (K 6.6),
and one dose of lactulose.

Studies:

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, no
change from prior studies.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2168-4-26**]
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained. Low
lung volumes limits evaluation. The lungs appear clear
bilaterally, demonstrate no evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No
pleural effusions or evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No pneumothorax is seen.
Visualized osseous structures are intact. A stent is noted in
the right upper quadrant compatible with TIPS.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with cirrhosis c/b portal gastropathy s/p TIPS
with recurrent hepatic encephalopathy presenting with altered
mental status requiring intubation overnight for airway
protection.
.
1.  Hepatic encephalopathy:  Pt's altered mental status is
likely [**2-13**] hepatic encephalopathy as pt improved with increased
lactulose.  She required intubation overnight for airway
protection.  There is no clear precipitant.  There is no clear
evidence of infection though patient did have a fever in the
ICU; this fever may have been due to aspiration peri-intubation.
 She had a RUQ that was negative for acute pathology, and she
had no ascites to tap.  Urine culture was negative.  BCxs have
no growth to date.  Sputum culture did grow moderate MRSA,
sparse GNRs; however, pt is known to be colonized with MRSA and
has no other s/sxs to suggest infection.  CXRs have been
unremarkable.  She tested negative for influenza and C. diff as
well.  Her zyprexa and keppra were held on admission and added
back as the pt's mental status returned to baseline, and she
tolerated them well.  She was continued on lactulose &
rifaximin.
.
2. Hepatitis C virus cirrhosis:  Her LFTs and coags remained at
baseline.  Pt was continued on lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic
encephalopathy.  Her Lasix was held on admission due to acute on
chronic renal failure.
.
3. Acute on chronic kidney disease:  Pt's baseline creatinine is
1.1-1.4.  Pt was likely volume depleted [**2-13**] poor po intake on
diuretics.  Her lasix was held on admission and her creatinine
returned to baseline.  She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] to
determine whether she should continue on diuretics.
.
4. Hypertension:  Pt's metoprolol was titrated up to Toprol XL
200 mg daily.  SBP at discharge ranged from 110-140.
.
5. Anemia:  This is multifactorial due to kidney disease, liver
disease, and chronic blood loss.  She was continued on iron
supplements.  She will resume Aranesp as an outpatient.
.
6. Psychosis: Patient was continued on her home regimen of
zyprexa.
.
7. Seizure disorder:  Pt was restarted on her keppra at lower
dose given her liver/kidney disease.  She had no seizures while
in house.
.
