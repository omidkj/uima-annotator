History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 106262**] is a 70 y/o female with schizophrenia, CHF (EF 10%),
hypothyroidism, cirrhosis of unknown etiology (seen on abd CT
[**8-8**]), constipation who was sent in from her facility due to a
low hematocrit of 14, down from 41 in [**2162-6-30**]. According to
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] presented to clinic this past Thursday with
lightheadedness and was thought to be dehydrated, orthostatic.
The thought was that she may have been over-diuresed and lasix,
spirinolactone was held. Patient had follow up two days later
along with labs drawn, which showed an acute Hct drop to 14.1.
Difficult to obtain thorough history; patient endorses some
decreased energy, feeling cold but exhibited disorganized
thoughts and low attention. Also has word finding difficulties,
all likely [**3-3**] chronic psychiatric history.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.0 74 107/41 16 100% RA. She was
noted to be guiac positive with gross melena. NG lavage was
negative. She was stared on a IV PPI gtt and Octreotide gtt.
Given 1 gram ceftiraxone. Hemodynamically statble. 2 large bores
.
On arrival to the ICU, VS stable at 97.2  78  100/87  95%RA. ROS
as above, otherwise negative, unobtainable.

Pertinent Results:
EGD [**9-29**]:
Impression: Erythema in the pylorus
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: No varices seen during EGD, but given her low
crits, varices might be flat at this time. Recommend transfusion
to keep crit above 25.
Proceed with colonoscopy when crits better. For now, monitor
crits closely, watch for further bleeding. Continue octreotide
drip and protonix drip pending complete GI workup.
.
TTE [**9-29**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). A left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: very poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Overall left ventricular function appears severely
depressed (? 25-30%), a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. The
presence of LV thrombus could not be assessed given the poor
quality of the study. If clinically indicated, focused views
with Definity could be obtained for better endocardial
definition.
.
EGD [**9-30**]:
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Normal mucosa in the stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow up per inpatient GI team recommendations
No source of bleeding found
.
Colonoscopy [**9-30**]:
Findings: Stool throughout the distal rectum
Recommendations: Please administer 4 liter golytely prep and
will re-evaluate for repeat colonoscopy tomorrow
.
EGD [**9-30**]:
Impression: Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Normal mucosa in the stomach
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow up per inpatient GI team recommendations
No source of bleeding found
.
CXR [**2162-10-2**]:
Questionable early infiltrate versus region of volume loss
versus
mass in the right lower lobe. Recommend followup.
.
CT CHEST [**2162-10-3**]:
5 mm right upper lobe nodule. Given her emphysema, this should
be followed up with chest CT in [**7-11**] months according to
[**Last Name (un) 8773**]
guidelines. [NEED FOR F/U COMMUNICATED TO PCP].
.
COLONIOSCOPY [**10-5**]: Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum.
.
CAPSULE ENDOSCOPY: FINAL READ PENDING.
.
No micro pending at time of discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 106262**] is a 70 y/o female with schizophrenia, cirrhosis on
abd CT [**8-8**], and CHF (EF 25%) who was admitted with melena
secondary to an occult GI bleed.  She was on coumadin for a
history of AFIB and prior LV thrombus--cardiology was consulted
and the decision was made to discontinue coumadin.  GI
evalaution was unrevealing with 2 negative EGDs & unremarkable
colonoscopy. Capsule study is pending at the time of discharge.
Her hospital course is summarized in further detail below by
major issues.
.
# Acute Blood Loss Anemia/ GI bleed:  With the concern that may
have variceal bleeding she was sent to the intensive care unit
and started on a PPI and octreotide drip. Upper endoscopy did
not reveal varices, and only showed mild gastritis for which she
was started on a proton pump inhibitor. The gastritis was
unlikely to be the cause of her GI bleeding, and a second upper
endoscopy was performed, which was unrevealing. An initial
colonoscopy was unsuccessful due to incomplete preparation. She
was transfused 5 units of packed red blood cells, with
improvement of her HCT to approximately 30 from an initial value
of 14. Her hematocrit remained stable after the initial
transfusions and melena did not recur.  A second colonoscopy was
adequate and was unrevealing. A capsule endoscopy is pending at
the time of discharge and results will be communicated by
gastroenterology.  She is tolerating a regular (low sodium diet)
and has follow-up scheduled with GI. Her hematocrit should be
checked on [**2162-10-11**].  She has been in the 28-31 range after the
initial transfusions.
.
# Left Ventricular thrombus: She had a history of a Left
ventricular thrombus diagnosed at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital in [**Month (only) **]
[**2161**], for which she had been on coumadin
