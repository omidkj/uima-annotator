---------------
[**2150-7-10**] KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) RIGHT X-Ray:  There are no
signs of acute fractures or dislocations. There is no joint
effusion. No focal lytic or blastic lesions are present. No
significant degenerative changes are identified. Vascular
calcifications are seen within the medial soft tissues.
.
[**2150-7-10**] Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound:
Duplicated mid right superficial femoral vein, with DVT within
only one of these vessels. Otherwise unremarkable.
.
[**2150-7-10**] CXR (PA and Lat):  Cardiomegaly is stable. Right lower
lobe atelectasis has almost resolved. Small left pleural
effusion with adjacent atelectasis has markedly improved. There
is no evident pneumothorax. There is S-shaped scoliosis. The
aorta is tortuous.
.
[**2150-7-12**] KUB: There is mild distention of multiple small bowel
loops that are air filled. There is some gas in the colon. There
are few air-fluid levels.  Moderate-to-severe degenerative
changes are in the lumbar spine. There is a right hip
prosthesis.
.
[**2150-7-13**] CT Torso W/Contrast: 1. New multifocal airspace
opacities in the lungs, most severe in the right lower and
middle lobes, which may be infectious. However, a short interval
followup is suggested to assess for resolution.
2. Focal filling defect within a segmental branch of right upper
lobe,
suspicious for pulmonary embolism.
3. Left breast calcified nodule, which is unchanged from prior
study, and
mammographic correlation is again suggested.
4. Mild dilation of both small and large bowel loops, with
evidence of a
prior bowel resection. These findings could reflect an ileus.
5. Cholelithiasis, within a distended gallbladder. No
gallbladder wall
thickening or pericholecystic fluid.
.
[**2150-7-13**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regi
