Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pacemaker placement
L cephalic dual chamber St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] pacemaker
angioplasty of left iliac and profunda


History of Present Illness:
81F with a history of ESRD on dialysis and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation not on anticoagulation due to history of GI bleed
and fall risk admitted for angioplasty of her left iliac artery
who developed atrial fibrillation to 140s during angioplasty on
[**12-2**] for symptomatic leg ischemia. She received multiple IV
boluses of lopressor as well as 25mg PO x 2 with eventual
decrease in heart rates to 100s. She was noted to have several
bradycardic episodes to 30s ([**3-17**] second pauses) with blood
pressures remaining in 100s. While speaking to the resident this
morning, she again developed heart rates in the 30s and reported
feeling dizzy and became diaphoretic. She also had a single 10
second pause at dialysis today also associated with some
lightheadedness. She was also noted to have pauses on telemetry.
Per the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been treated in the past with
small doses of betablocker which resulted in bradycardia. Thus,
this was discontinued and by report, she has not been troubled
by rapid heart rates. Cardiology (EP) was consulted for possible
tachy-brady syndrome and the possible need for a pacemaker
On cardiac review of symptoms, she denies chest pain. She does
report occasional dizziness at home and at hemodialysis,
exertional SOB and [**Location (un) **].
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2122-12-3**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). There is
considerable beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**] +) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2116-2-10**], left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is
now present.



Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Tachy-brady syndrome - The patient presented symptoms and
telemetry consistent with tachy brady syndrome. She initially
had several long pauses, up to 7 seconds, likely exacerbated by
nodal agents given to her to control her a.fib with RVR. She is
s/p St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] pacer placement [**12-8**]. She tolerated the
procedure well and metoprolol was added to her regimen to rate
control. Per EP her metoprolol was changed to amiodarone to both
rate control her and attempt rhythm control. She will follow up
with EP and device clinic. She was evaluated by PT and initially
felt to be a candidate for inpatient rehabilitation. Both the
patient and her niece were against this. The niece was able to
demonstrate that she could complete single person assist
transfers, similar to the patients prior level of functioning.
The risks of home discharge were explained to the patient and
her niece and they accepted them.
.
# PAD - S/P angioplasty of left iliac and profunda after
initially presenting with symptoms of ischemia to the vascular
service. She was started on plavix and continued on her aspirin.
She will follow up with the vascular surgeon.
.
# ESRD - Continued on MWF dialysis. Had one episode of
hypotension at dialysis after she was dialyzed to below her dry
weight after a change in scale. She will continue her outpatient
dialysis schedule.
.
.
# Hypothyroidism - Continued on home levothyroxine.
