ECG: Sinus at 103 with LAD, Q in II, III, avf (old) [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in I, AVL, V4-V6.

Cath: [**2163-2-15**]: 3VD: LAD 80%, D2 70%, LCX 80%, RCA 100%. LM mild
dz. Hemodynamics normal. CO 7.5/3.9

Echo: [**2163-2-21**]: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated. No thrombus. 1+ AR. Mild
aortic stenosis. Partial mitral leaflet flail, no vegetation. 3+
MR.

Echo: [**3-18**]:
Conclusions:  The left ventricular cavity is dilated. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
withglobal hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the inferior
wall. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function may be more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is partial mitral
leaflet flail. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


IMPRESSION: Dilated LV cavity with severe global LV hypokinesis
and regional  akinesis of the inferior wall c/w multivessel CAD.
Partial flail of the posterior mitral leaflet with moderate to
severe, eccentric MR. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Borderline RV systolic function.

Cardiac Catheterization [**3-18**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

revealed critical CAD.  The LMCA had a 30% stenosis.  The LAD
had a 90%
proximal stenosis and an 80% mid-vessel stenosis.  The LCx had
an 80%
proximal lesion.  The RCA was not injected as it was known to be

occluded.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right and
left sided
filling pressures with pulmonary hypertension and a severely
depressed
cardiac output.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed given the patients
renal
dysfunction and hemodynamics.
4.  An IABP was successfully placed with good diastolic
augmentation.
5.  Case discussed with the patient's attending physician and [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
CT
surgery consult was obtained urgently.  Given that the patient's

coronary anatomy was unchanged from the previous cath, the plan
will be
for hemodynamics optimization prior to CABG/MVR.

echo [**3-21**]:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed with inferolateral and
inferior, apical and distal anteroseptal akinesis. Intrinsic LV
function may be more depressed given the severity of the MR.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
probable vegetation on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

cath [**2163-3-22**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the LCX with a Drug Eluting Stent.
3. Successful rotational athetrectomy of the mid and proximal
LAD
followed by stenting of the mid and proximal LAD with two
overlapping
Drug Eluting Stents.
4. Successful stenting of the Left Main with a Drug Eluting
Stent.
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant system. The right coronary was known to be occluded and
was not
engaged. The Left Main had a 30% stenosis. The proximal LAD had
a 90%
stenosis and a 90% mid stenosis. The LCX had a 90% mid stenosis.
2. Successful stenting of the LCX with a 2.5x13mm Cypher DES
(See PTCA
comments).
3. Successful Rotati
