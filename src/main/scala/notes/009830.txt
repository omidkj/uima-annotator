Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
syncopy, nausea, vomiting, left lower extremity cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
80F who suffered a syncopal fall at her house with mild
confusion while walking after 2-3 days of nausea, vomiting, and
diearrhea.  Recovered quickly to a GCS of 15, interactive and
telling jokes.  The patient presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, where she
was found to have a SBP in the 60's, but fluid resuscitation
with
two liters of crystalloid returned her to a BP of 120's.
Additionally, the patient is febrile with cellulitis over ther L
incision and a nidus that appears to be the left foot.  No
evidence of graft compromise or infection, although it appears
to
track right over the incision.  The patient has a palpable
dorsalis pedis pulse, and the graft was recently studied and
deemed to be patient.

Of note, the patient is status-post
bilateral femoropopliteal bypasses, the right one in [**2157**] and
the second one in [**2166**].  A vein graft angioplasty was done on
the left resulting in a vein graft rupture, which required a
covered stent. She experiences pain in her feet at night, this
is improved by walking.

Currently, she has a fever, has no abdominal pain without any
evidence of ischemic compromise, but she continues to have
intermittent dropping BP's.

Pertinent Results:
 Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2170-5-18**]):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and [**Female First Name (un) 564**] species.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was originally admitted to the medicine service for
evaluation of falls, nausea, and vomiting.  CT head on [**2170-5-15**]
showed no acute intracranial process. Sequelae of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease.  Minimal ethmoid sinus disease, likely
due to inflammation. She also underwent a CT abd/pelvis, which
showed the following:
1. Dilated pancreatic duct particularly distally within the
head. Recommend
MRCP for further evaluation on a non-emergent basis.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease within the abdominal aorta
and its
branches, but no evidence of aneurysm.
3. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, but no evidence of
diverticulitis.
4. Compression fractures of T12 and T8 are unchanged compared to
priors.
5. Small hiatal hernia.

She underwent an ECHO, which showed no substantial change from
her prior, essentially normal.  EF > 55%.  Further details can
be seen in the ECHO report.  She also underwent carotid duplex,
which showed bilateral 60 to 69% carotid stenosis.

After other workup was negative for infectious sources, she was
transferred to the [**Date Range 1106**] service for treatment of left lower
extremity cellulitis.  She underwent a duplex of the lower
extremity, which showed no evidence of DVT or fluid collections
in the left lower extremity.  She was placed on broad spectrum
antibiotics, vanc/cipro/flagyl.  She was pan-cultured, and one
bottle of blood on [**2170-5-15**] returned as MSSA.  Infectious disease
was consulted and recommended stopping cipro and flagyl in light
of her history of c. difficile.  Vancomycin was continued, given
the patient's allergy to PCN.  The patient's leg did not show
dramatic improvement over the next few days; therefore, she
underwent a CT of the LLE on [**2170-5-21**]. This showed Extensive left
lower extremity subcutaneous edema without focal fluid
collection. Limited evaluation of left femoropopliteal bypass
graft without evidence of fluid collection along the graft. WIll
continue a total course of Vanco X 4 weeks.

During this stay she required Lasix of LE edema. On [**5-24**], BP
80's. Lasix discontinued and plan for Lasix 20mg prn for
swelling ordered per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Will also start Regular Diet
without salt restriction. INR 3.0, drifting [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Will decrease
to 2mg daily with goal 2, given history of GI bleed (Coumadin is
her home medication).
