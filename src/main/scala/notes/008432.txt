Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1185**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
40M with history of CAD s/p cath [**9-25**], DM2, hypertension,
multinodular goiter with microcalcifications, ulcerative colitis
status post colectomy with permanent ileostomy, presents with
atypical chest pain.  He was discharged on [**9-26**] for admission
for positive stress test, found to have 50% LAD stenosis which
was not intervened on given poor medical compliance, started on
high dose statin and discharged.  He presents again today with
chest pain, however he declines to give a history.  Per PCP call
in, pt stated "I want to blow myself up"  "Put myself in front
of a car to be run over" and "My mind is just too full, too
chaotic, just want it to stop."  States the "it" he wants to
stop is his medical       difficulties.  Patient also states
that he wants to "blow us all up" pointing to the doctor, myself
and his mother in the room with him, and using his hand in what
looks like pressing detonator of an       explosive.  [**Name (NI) 1094**]
mother states he talks like this when he is at medical
appointment, but at home is calm and notin danger.  He was sent
to ED for psych evaluation and for evaluation of chest pain.  No
abd pain, vomiting, diarrhea.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.1 99 160/90 20 99%.  EKG with
sinus tach to 103, LVH, nl axis, and TWI in I, aVL, V4, V6.  ABG
was done for question of altered mental status which showed pH
7.29, pCO2 38, pO2 36, HCO3 19, non-gap.  Stox and Utox
negative.  Given kayexalate 60 gm x 1 for K of 5.7.  Als
received ceftriaxone and dexamethasone.  CXR with changse c/w
CHF.  Cardiology fellow called, felt that he is not a candidate
for stenting given his likely noncompliance with medication. He
was given a dose of dexamethasone for possible adrenal
insufficiency in this presentation. Pt was diuresed with 40 mg
IV lasix and admitted to the MICU for acidosis. VS on transfer
100, 191/84, 16, 99% RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt interviewed with mother and
Portuguese interpreter.  He denies any complaints but is upset
that he is here.  Since discharge on [**9-26**], he has felt well, no
medication changes other than the lipitor started at his last
discharge.  No diarrhea, no vomiting, no ingestions, denies any
drug use.  He presented to clinic for a scheduled discharge
followup visit and says that his comments above were said under
stress of meeting a new doctor who was "asking too many
questions."  Denies any SI/HI and requesting to be left alone to
rest. He feels better in that his lower extremity edema has
improved, but was not short of breath at home. Ate out at Panera
and Subway multiple times this week.

CXR:
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: There is central pulmonary
vascular
congestion with moderate pulmonary edema. The chronicity of
these findings is unknown due to the lack of comparison studies.
There is no focal
consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Congestive heart failure, likely acute. Acute
myocardial
infarction should be ruled out as the cause of failure given
patient's young age and acuity of presentation.
.
EKG: No evidence of ischemic changes.  NSR unchanged from prior
baseline.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13531**] is a 40 man with history of CAD s/p cath [**2104-9-25**], DM2,
hypertension, multinodular goiter with microcalcifications,
ulcerative colitis status post colectomy with permanent
ileostomy, presents with non-anion gap metabolic acidosis,
possible SI/HI, lower extremity edema.  Patient initially
admitted to MICU for non-anion gap acidosis.

1. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Previously noted on prior
recent blood chemistry, although bicarb slightly lower. pCO2 of
38 not c/w respiratory compensation.  Anion gap is 12 (wnl).  On
differential diagnosis was GI loss, RTA, ingestions,
post-hypocapnia (renal wasting of HCO3 after respiratory
alkalosis with transient acidosis).  No h/o diarrhea, ingestions
or medication changes.  Patient currently appears
hemodynamically stable and mental status is at baseline per
mother and interpreter.

Prior to transfer from ICU, bicarb improved to 19. On discussion
with renal overall picture most consistent with type IV RTA.
Patient [**Name (NI) **] was stopped and switched to amlodipine.

2. CHF: On exam appears to be fluid overloaded given bilateral
crackles at bases, lower extremity edema, and evidence on CXR.
Already received 40 mg IV lasix with some improvement in edema.
Patient received an additional dose of IV lasix in the MICU and
was transitioned to his PO dose of lasix on day 2 of admission.
 He has had recent cardiac problems and the decision was made
not to treat a stenosis on the basis of his noncompliance.  He
had also been written for home lasix which he had not been
taking.  Given lack of EKG changes and negative enzymes x 1 in
context of recent cardiac workup no further cardiac evaluation
was performed.

3. Suicial/Homicidal Ideation:  Patient expressed SI/HI during
clinic visit for which he was sent to emergency department.
Throughout admission patient denied any HI/SI. He was initially
under section 12 based on his behavior and psych eval in clinic.
 He was seen
