HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47 year old
female with a history of intravenous drug abuse who has been
treated for multiple episodes of endocarditis in the past
with her most recent episode in [**2182**]. At that time she had
been informed that she has tricuspid regurgitation and
recommended a repair of her tricuspid valve which she
declined. Over the last several years she is becoming more
symptomatic complaining of fatigue, dyspnea on exertion,
palpitations and chest tightness and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her
cardiologist, referred her for surgical evaluation. She
currently describes dyspnea on exertion with chest tightness
and stabbing pain which will resolve spontaneously. She has a
history of varicose veins and has bled from the varicose
veins requiring transfusions but otherwise no new symptoms
are noted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for asthma, hepatitis C
with active titers, fibromyalgia, Raynaud's, chronic fatigue
syndrome, bipolar disorder, endocarditis times five, history
of intravenous drug abuse, varicose veins, renal calculi,
ectopic pregnancy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for a right
thoracotomy secondary to emphysema in [**2182**] and right carpal
tunnel release.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Ultram 60 mg q 4 hours
p.r.n., methadone 40 mg daily, OxyContin 5 mg as needed,
Ventolin 3 puffs daily, meclozine as needed.

ALLERGIES:  Are to penicillin which is anaphylaxis. Codeine
which is gastrointestinal upset.

Last dental examination was on [**2192-3-24**], she had several
extractions and was cleared for surgery by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is currently not working. She lives with
her mother. She smokes one pack a day, just has an occasional
drink with meals. Denies any current intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preoperatively her examination
includes she is 5 foot 1 inches tall, weight is 147, heart
rate is 87, regular, blood pressure of 146/78. She is anxious
appearing. The neck is supple with no jugular venous
distension. The heart is regular with a IV/VI systolic
ejection murmur, a II/VI diastolic murmur. The lungs are
clear. The abdomen is soft, nontender. Lower extremities have
bilateral varicosities. She has 2+ distal lower extremity
pulses.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  Included hematocrit of 37.2,
platelets of 128, INR of 1.3. Urinalysis significant for 25
red cells, 2 white cells, less than 1 epithelial. BUN and
creatinine of 12 and 0.7. Hemoglobin A1C of 5.3.

Echocardiogram from [**2192-2-24**] showed an ejection of 60 to 65
percent, 4+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild left atrial
enlargement, moderately dilated right atrium and moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Cardiac
catheterization on [**2192-3-16**] demonstrated severe tricuspid
regurgitation, normal coronaries.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The day of admission the patient was taken
to the operating room where she underwent a tricuspid valve
replacement with a 29 mm pericardial valve. Intraoperatively
she tolerated the procedure well but there was an episode of
complete heart block and by the end of the case this had
evolved to block with junctional escape rhythm. Due to the
dysrhythmia a permanent epicardial pacing wire was placed at
the end of the case and its lead remained in the subcutaneous
tissue of the abdomen. The typical electrocardial wires were
placed as well. She was transported to the Cardiac Intensive
Care Unit stable and intubated with a little bit of pressor
support. Over the next day she was extubated, pressor support
weaned and pain service and the electrophysiological service
were consulted. She remained hemodynamically stable by
postoperative day one. She remained in a first degree AV
block.  Her beta blocker was dosed initially but then was
stopped due to worry that this might precipitate complete
heart block. She was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day #2 and since then on postoperative day #3
had a temperature spike. She was pancultured, started on
empiric levofloxacin. There have been no positive cultures to
date but she is continued on a full course of antibiotics and
she has defervesced. She has received physical therapy and at
this current time has completed level 4 with the plan of
completing a level 5 prior to discharge. She had a
postoperative anemia which was treated with iron sulfate and
vitamin C. Initially she was on a Dilaudid PCA and the acute
pain service has helped manage her pain regimen and has
evolved down back to the pre-hospitalization regimen. On
postoperative day six her epicardial wires were removed. She
has remained hemodynamically stable in a sinus rhythm with a
first degree block and the EP service is continuing to
follow. The pain service will continue to follow her as an
outpatient as before. She is now currently stable and ready
for discharge to home.
