History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6955**] is a 68 year old male who was diagnosed with
esophageal cancer and underwent He underwent concurrent
chemoradiation therapy with cisplatin and 5-FU and radiation
therapy under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12354**].  He has undergone
post-treatment imaging with a PET scan that shows two foci of
uptake in the distal esophagus with no evidence of distant
disease on this study.  He is known to have a lytic lesion in
T11
and the day after our visit, underwent an MRI scan, which showed
no evidence of metastatic disease to the spine. A CT angiogram
was done [**10-3**] in light of his CAD This study showed no
atherosclerotic disease within
the celiac axis or gastroepiploic artery.  Finally, has also
undergone a coronary catheterization on [**12-3**].  This study
showed normal LV function with an occluded right coronary and
60%
mid LAD lesion. Based on his symptoms and imaging he was
admitted to the hospital for surgical resection.

DIAGNOSIS:

I. Esophagus, esophagogastrectomy (A-AE):



          1. Residual intramucosal adenocarcinoma with adjuvant
therapy
effect, arising in a background of Barrett's esophagus with
dysplasia; see synoptic report.

          2. Five lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/5;
majority of periesophageal and perigastric soft tissue is
submitted for lymph node evaluation).

 II. Level 7 lymph nodes, excisional biopsy (AF-AG):



          Twelve lymph nodes with no carcinoma seen (0/12).

 III. Gastric donut (AH):

 Gastric corpus segment with prominent cautery effect and no
carcinoma seen.

IV. Esophageal donut (AI-AJ):

 Squamous esophageal segment with no carcinoma seen.

V. Fundus, segmental resection (AK-[**Doctor Last Name **]):

 Gastric corpus segment with mild chronic active gastritis and
focal reactive changes, consistent with adjuvant therapy effect.


No carcinoma seen.

[**2179-1-2**] CTA :
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
2. Gastric pull-through with no evidence for intrathoracic
abscess. There
is, however multiloculated regions of air identified along the
oblique and
horizontal fissures with a small less than 10% dependent
pneumothorax
identified on the right side.
3. Bilateral multifocal infiltrates within both lungs with
compressive
atelectasis noted at the lower lobes bilaterally. Findings may
be as a result of sequelae of infection.

[**2179-1-4**]
CXR :Region of consolidation in the axillary left upper lobe
which developed between [**1-2**] and [**1-3**] is still
present as are larger regions of heterogeneous opacification in
both lower lungs, all strongly suggestive of widespread
pneumonia, particularly the findings in the left lung since
esophagectomy typically entails considerable right basal
atelectasis. Right pleural tube in place. No pneumothorax or
appreciable pleural effusion.  Right subclavian infusion port
ends in the low SVC. Midline drain still in place. No
pneumothorax

[**2179-1-5**]
Ba swallow:
No leak,some expected holdup at the pylorus but without
obstruction.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2179-1-8**]**

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2179-1-8**]):
      Feces negative for C.difficile toxin A & B by EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6955**] was admitted to the hospital and taken to the
Operating Room where he underwent a minimally invasive
esophagectomy (see formal op note for details).  He tolerated
the procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
His pain was initially controlled with an epidural catheter and
he maintained stable hemodynamics.

His tube feedings were started on post op day #0 with replete
and unfortunately he had some cloudy drainage from his JP drain
by post op day 3 along with an elevated triglyceride level
indicating a thoracic duct leak.  At that point he was changed
to elemental feedings which he tolerated well and his JP
drainage cleared.

His pain got a bit worse and it was determined that the epidural
was not functioning therefore it was replaced. In the interim he
desaturated and a CTA was done which ruled out a PE.  He did
have some infiltrates on xray and therefore underwent vigorous
