[**2177-8-8**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum and
anterior walls, distal inferior wall, and apex. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %).There is an apical left
ventricular aneurysm. Mild spontaneous echo contrast but no
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricular apex. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2177-8-8**] Head CT Scan:
There is no evidence of acute major vascular territorial
infarct. There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, obvious
masses, mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures.
Moderate atrophy is seen causing prominence of ventricles and
sulci. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: 1. No acute intracranial pathology.  2. Left
parieto-occipital hypoattenuation likely from old infarct. 3.
Chronic small vessel ischemic disease, and moderately severe
atrophy.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted with NSTEMI and congestive heart
failure. Given recent Plavix, surgery was delayed and he
underwent extensive preoperative evaluation. He remained pain
free on intravenous Heparin. Preoperative antibiotics were given
for a positive urinalysis. Head CT scan showed no acute
pathology. Neurology evaluation was consistent with dementia,
most likely multiple infarct dementia. He was cleared for
surgery by the Neurology service but remained high risk for
stroke based on his risk factors and previous history of
strokes. After extensive evaluation, his family agreed and gave
surgical consent to proceed with surgical revascularization. The
remainder of his preoperative course was uneventful.

On [**8-12**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed urgent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. See operative note for details. Following
surgery, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. Given dementia, narcotics were
avoided. He otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the SDU on postopertive day one.

Blood glucoses were initially elevated, but came under better
control on resuming home doses of metformin and glipizide, in
addition to Lantus and sliding scale insulin.  Lantus was
discontinued upon discharge.
BUN and Creatinine rose and were monitored closely. creatinine
peaked at 1.9 with baseline of 1.5.  Foley was maintained to
closely monitor urine output.  When the foley was removed, he
failed a void trial, despite a bladder scan for 800cc, foley was
replaced and Flomax was started.  he will need a repaet voding
trial at rehab.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility and rehab was recommended
prior to return to home.

 By the time of discharge on POD #6 the patient was ambulating
with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital **]
rehab in [**Location (un) 701**] in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
