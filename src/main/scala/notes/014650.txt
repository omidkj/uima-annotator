HOSPITAL COURSE:  After transfer to the floor, patient was
continued on po prednisone for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation and levofloxacin for possible bronchitis
or community acquired pneumonia.  Given his slow improvement,
he was continued on prednisone 60 mg po q.d. without a taper
in the hospital.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], patient's
pulmonologist, saw the patient in the hospital and thought
his slow improvement was secondary to his poor pulmonary
function at baseline, however, given his persistent
tachycardia, he did have a CT angiogram in the hospital which
showed no evidence of pulmonary emboli.  Although, he
remained atrial fibrillation and chest x-ray showed no
evidence of pneumonia, the decision was to finish a 14 day
course of levofloxacin to cover possible bronchitis and
community acquired pneumonia.  Fingerstick and regular
insulin sliding scale was discontinued since his blood sugar
remained within the normal range while on high dose steroids.
She had been evaluated by the physical therapist in the
hospital and home 02 was recommended since patient
desaturates into the low 80s on room air with ambulating.
