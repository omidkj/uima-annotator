Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2172-12-4**] and admitted to
the orthopedic service.  He was seen by both medicine and
cardiology for pre-operative risk assessments.  On [**2172-12-5**] he
was taken to the operating room for a right hip
hemiarthroplasty.  Intra-operatively the patient had a NSTEMI.
He was brought to the SICU post-operatively.  His troponins
trended down from 0.3 to 0.15 and he was stable enough to be
transferred to the floor.  On the floor he was evaluated by
physical therapy and progressed well.  Cardiology saw the
patient daily and adjusted his lopressor to control his heart
rate adequately.  On [**2171-12-9**] his incision was found to have
increased erythema and warmth.  Ancef was started for this
cellulitis and the erythema improved.  A repeat echocardiogram
was done which was unchanged from previous.  His hospital course
was otherwise without incident.  His pain was well controlled.
His labs and vital signs remained stable.  He is being
discharged today to rehab in stable condition.
