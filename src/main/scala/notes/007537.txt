History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old male with known coronary artery disease
and aortic stenosis who presents today for surgical evaluation.
Past medical history notable for prior myocardial infarctions
and RCA stenting at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2172**](bare metal) and
stenting at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2182**](drug-eluting). He also has severe COPD
on chronic steroids and intermittant home oxygen use.

He was recently admitted to OSH with worsening shortness of
breath and COPD exacerbation. He ruled out for an MI. There was
no history of chest pain, syncope, diaphoresis or
lightheadedness. He admits to severe dyspnea at less than 20

[**2184-9-1**]
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move
normally. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal LV function and borderline RV function. No
evidence of vegetations or abscess on the valves or perivalvular
regions. Bioprosthetic aortic valve well seated without
perivalvular leak or significant stenosis. No pericardial
effusion or evidence of tamponade physiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with worsening symptoms
related to critical aortic stenosis presenting for aortic valve
replacement. He also has coronary artery disease and had
multiple interventions to his coronaries. [**2184-8-30**]
Mr.[**Known lastname 82095**] went to the operating room and underwent an
Aortic valve replacement with 21-mm St.
[**Hospital 923**] Medical Biocor Epic Tissue Valve with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please
refer to the operative report for further surgical details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU
intubated and sedated on Neosynephrine for blood pressure
support. He awoke neurologically intact and was extubated on
POD#1. Preoperative steroids were resumed for his significant
COPD history. Nicardipine, as opposed to beta-blocker was
utilized for increased cardiac selection and to minimize
bronchospasm. He remained hemodynamically stable and was weaned
off all drips. Coreg/Statin/Aspirin/home dose of Theophylline
and diuresis was initiated. General surgery was consulted for
concern of bowel ischemia and rising lactate.His respiratory
status remained tenuous post extubation and on POD#2 he was
reintubated for  worsening respiratory distress and lactic
acidosis. He was pan cultured for a rising WBC count. Empiric
antibiotics were initiated. CT scan of his abdomen revealed
dilated loops of bowel but no evidence of bowel ischemia per
General Surgery. He was kept NPO and serial lactates followed.
His abdominal exam improved and the acidosis corrected. POD# 5
he was extubated for the second time. His rhythm went into an
SVT 170s. Adenosine was administered to assess the acutely rapid
rhythm which was revealed to be atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone
and Lopressor were administered with conversion to normal sinus
rhythm with premature atrial contractions. He was intermittently
between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation and was started on
Coumadin. His pulmonary status remained tenuous postoperatively
requiring ventilatory support with noninvasive biphasic positive
airway pressure intermittently.

He was reintubated on [**2184-9-7**] for respiratory failure and
aggressively diuresed with a Lasix drip. Epinephrine and
Levophed drips were started for hypotension and they were weaned
off in the following 2 days.  He had a right upper quandrant
ultrasound which was negative for choleycystis due to abdominal
distention and hypotension. He was extubated on [**2184-9-10**] and did
well with aggressive pulmonary toilet. His steroids were weaned
and he was started on a standing oral steroid dose. Nutritional
support was provided via tube feeds, which were cycled from 7 pm
to 7 am after he passed a speech and swallow evaluation on POD#
14 for puree solids with thin liquids. The infectious disease
team was consulted for a leukocytosis and recommended
discontinuing the Cefepime (which he was on for Serratia in the
sputum) and continuing Vancomycin for a total of 7 days for coag
negative staphylococcus in [**12-1**] blood cultures.  New blood
cultures were drawn as well as C diff on [**9-13**] and these were
pending at the time of discharge. Once these are finalized as
negative, all antibiotics should be stopped [**2184-9-19**]. We will
follow up with the rehab if blood cultures turn positive to
recommend a longer course. A new PICC was placed [**2184-9-13**].
Coumadin stopped per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-14**]. His dobhoff tube was
removed on POD number 16 and calorie counts were begun.  He was
cleared for discharge to
