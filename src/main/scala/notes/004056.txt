wife had already gone to bed. When his wife awoke the next
morning, she found him at about 6 am lying face down on the
floor, unable to speak or move his right side. His daughter came
over, and thought he seemed sleepy, but noted he did look up at
her when she was there. EMS was called and brought him
immediately to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

CT HEAD: 1. Dense left middle cerebral artery with loss of
definition of insular region indicative of an evolving infarct.
2. Perfusion defect in the left middle cerebral artery territory
with increased transit time and decreased blood volume
suggestive of an evolving infarct. 3. CT angiography of the neck
demonstrates complete occlusion of the left
internal carotid artery in the neck with calcification at the
bifurcation.
60-70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery is seen at
the
bifurcation. 4. CTA of the head demonstrates filling defect in
the left middle cerebral artery M1 segment with diminished flow
in the distal left MCA territory.

MRI: Acute left sided basal ganglia and anterior MCA territory
infarcts. No hemorrhage. Clot in the middle cerebral artery
region.

ECHO: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved left ventricular
systolic function. No intracardiac shunt with saline contrast
injected at rest (unable to cooperate with maneuvers).


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially admitted to the neuro-ICU for observation
following his acute infarct.  An MRI showed an acute infarct in
left MCA territory.  This was likely cardio-embolic as he was
noted to be in A-fib upon admission.  He was started on aspirin
but anticoagulation was not initiallly started because of the
size of the lesion and risk for hemorrhagic conversion.  His
exam slowly improved and he became more alert. Despite being
more alert he failed multiple swallow evaluations and had a
g-tube placed on [**3-12**].  He was started on coumadin after the
g-tube was placed.  He should stay on aspirin 81mg until his
coumadin becomes therapeutic (INR [**2-9**]).
