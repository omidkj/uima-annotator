Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2553**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**9-19**] and [**9-20**]


History of Present Illness:
51 year male s/p HLD, CABG x3 (LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein from
aorta to D1, saphenous vein from aorta to post left ventricular
coronary artery) [**8-27**] w/ synthes plating on [**8-27**] awoke with 4/10
chest pressure at the upper pole of his incision and presented
to the [**Hospital1 882**] ER on [**9-18**].
.
Patient states that morning that he awoke with this pleuritic
CP, dissimilar to his GERD sxs.  Did not think that he had it
the night before. He describes being unable to take a deep
breath. He does not think that it radiated anywhere.  Was given
SL NTG and dropped his SBP from 110/60 to 70/palp and became
nauseous and diaphoretic, though states currently that this was
what relieved his CP.  Given volume resuscitation with return of
hemodynamic EKG w/ ST changes in V1-3 per report. First set of
enzymes neg. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to CCU for
evaluation.
.
Had cardiac catheterization on [**9-19**] and had thrombectomy and
stent of SVG to right PL branch and moderate severe stenosis of
LIMA graft which was not intervened upon. He received plavix
600mg PO X1.
.
The morning of [**9-20**] at approx 645 am he awoke with 9/10 chest
pain across his chest in a similar distribution and quality to
that for which he initially presented.  He was evaluated and was
noted to be diaphoretic. He dropped his SBPs to 60s and HR was
up to 110s. VS per trigger note: 77/49, 62/41, HR 97, sat 80s on
RA improved to 100% on NRB.  FS was 117.  Bedside echo without
effusion.  Received 1L of NS BP back to SBPs 120s. Patient
reports that his CP had decreased to [**12-5**] prior to arrival in
the CCU. He states he thinks he had the more intense pain for
10-15 minutes. He states that he had had no CP at all for the 2
days prior to this event while at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
When in the CCU he reports that he never had an episode like
this before. States that the pain is still 1 or less than 1 but
above 0 out of 10 and dull. He says that his initially work-up
leading to the CABG was as a result of exertional (with running)
burning bronchial pain which started 2 years ago.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, black stools or
red stools. All of the other review of systems were negative.

MICRO/PATH: NONE
.
IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
CXR PORTABLE [**2108-9-18**]:
Near complete resolution of bibasilar atelectasis with only
possible small
left effusion.
.
ECHO [**2108-9-19**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness is mildly increased with normal cavity size. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior septum, inferior wall,
and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
C.CATH [**2108-9-19**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel native coronary artery disease
2. Successful Export thrombectomy and stenting of SVG to right
posterolateral branch.
3. Aspirin and Plavix indefinitely. Integrilin IV for 18 hours.
4. RFA sheath removal when ACT < 170 secs.
5. Note moderate severity stenosis at distal anastomosis of LIMA
graft.
