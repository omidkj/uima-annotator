Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service on
[**2132-9-30**]. He was placed on IV antibiotics and gentle IV fluids.
His digoxin was held preoperatively due to a supratherapeutic
level on admission.  He underwent a right transmetatarsal
amputation on [**2132-10-1**] without complication.  Postoperatively he
recovered in the post-anesthesia care unit and then was
transferred to the vascular surgical floor.  On the evening of
POD 0 he was found unresponsive (last seen responsive 5 minutes
prior) and a code blue was initiated.  He was noted to have no
pulse and no spontaneous respirations.  CPR and bag mask
ventilation were begun as the code was initiated.  He was found
to be in ventricular fibrillation.  Intubation was performed
without difficulty.  The patient's internal defibrilator shocked
the patient intermittently.  External shocks were administered
as well.  He intermittently regained a pulse after shocks
however was unable to sustain this until approximately 10minutes
into the code.  CPR was continued throughout until a sustained
pulse was obtained.

[**2132-10-2**]
He was transfered to the SICU following the code.  He was noted
to have intermittent myoclonic jerking.  His pacemaker was
interogated to see if shocks were still being administered
despite a sustained paced rhythm however there was no
defibrilator activity and it was deemed that the jerking was
likely from seizure activity and neurology was immediately
called.  The Arctic Sun was initiated for hypothermic protocol.
He was put on continuous EEG monitoring and started on
antiepileptics. A TEE showed myocardial depression and
Dobutamine was started .  He was placed on a heparin gtt.

Over the course of the next two days he continued in acute renal
failure, cardiac troponin elevation, and seizure activity.
Discussions as to his poor prognosis were make with the family
and they elected to make the patient comfort measures only due
to his prior wishes to not be kept alive via external measures
for a prolonged period.  He was extubated on [**10-5**] and expired
with the family at the bedside.  Family and the medical examiner
declined autopsy.
