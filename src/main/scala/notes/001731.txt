CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2198-5-11**] 10:42 PM

Tip of the right jugular line projects over the SVC. Lung
volumes are appreciably lower today than on [**4-25**], which would
explain the left lower lobe atelectasis and increasing fullness
of the right hilus; however, when feasible, I would recommend
repeat routine radiographs with full inspiration.

Separation of the right jugular line from the trachea, which is
deviated slightly to the left is probably a longstanding
abnormality seen as early as [**2192-11-30**], such as an
enlarged right lobe of the thyroid gland rather than an acute
hematoma. No pneumothorax is present.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-5-13**] 8:33 AM

Consolidation in the right infrahilar lung and in the left lung
base has persisted since [**5-11**] following resolution of
previous mild pulmonary edema, now concerning for pneumonia.
Upper lungs clear. Heart size normal. Minimal if any pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax. Tip of the right jugular line
projects over the SVC.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2198-5-14**] 6:44 PM

AP BEDSIDE CHEST. There is a consolidation involving the right
medial lung base and bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis. I
cannot exclude a small effusion particularly on the right. Heart
normal size. Bilateral apical vascular prominence probably
reflecting lordotic semi-erect positioning and no overt vascular
congestion. Tip of right IJ line is in mid SVC. No PTX. Since
exam one day previous the consolidation in right lower lobe has
progressed.

IMPRESSION: Short interval progression right lower lobe
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on the day of surgery.  He underwent
thrombectomy of right iliofemoral graft and right femoral to
above knee popliteal artery bypass with 6 mm
Dacron graft.  He tolerated the procedure well and was noted to
have palpable pulses distally of the RLE.  He was monitored in
the VICU post-operatively without any acute issues.  He was
noted to have a productive cough and had a chest x-ray that was
questionable for a developing pneumonia.  He was started
empirically on a course of levoquin to continue for 7days. He
was out of bed with nursing and seen by physical therapy who
cleared him for home.  He remained on low flow nasal cannula
overnight but had no requirement during the day or when
ambulating.  This was consistent with his home regimen.  He was
restarted on coumadin at his home dose.  His incisions were
healing well and he was discharged to home on POD4 with
follow-up for staple removal.  His INR/coumadin will be followed
by his primary care.  He will have lab work on Friday.
