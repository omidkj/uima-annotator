HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 36-year-old male who
underwent an elective catheterization to evaluate worsening
fatigue and exertional angina and worsening heart failure.
Catheterization revealed a mean RA pressure of 8 mm, PA
systolic at 52, cardiac index 1.9, systolic arterial pressure
of 73.  Hemodynamics on milrinone demonstrated improvement on
cardiac output and augmentation of arterial pressure with an
RA of 8, PA of 53 and cardiac index of 2.3.  Selective
angiography of the right dominant system with no occlusive
disease.  He was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
milrinone therapy with the intention to send him home with
this therapy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant for coronary artery disease.  In [**2193-6-1**] he
had a myocardial infarction which was treated with TPA.
Catheterization:  He had a proximal left anterior descending
of 90% stenosis treated with thrombectomy and stent.  This
was complicated by pulmonary edema requiring intubation.
Coronary Care Unit course with IABP.  He also had an
echocardiogram in [**2193-6-1**] which showed an ejection
fraction of 20, mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
regurgitation.  Catheterization in [**2193-10-2**]:  Left
anterior descending stent with minimal restenosis, ejection
fraction 20 with akinesis of anterior lateral apical walls,
1+ mitral regurgitation.  Left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure of 36, RA 56/32.  Wedge of 36.  Echocardiogram in
[**Month (only) 1096**] .......... revealed an ejection fraction of less
than 20.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Diabetes type 2.
4.  Cocaine abuse.
5.  Alcohol abuse.  Had B positive serologies, status post
Intraventricular conduction delay placement for nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81.
2.  Glucophage 500 twice a day.
3.  Lasix 120 a.m., 80 q.p.m.
4.  Lisinopril 20 once a day.
5.  Lipitor 10 q.d.
6.  Coreg 25 b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile. Blood pressure of
110/68.  83.  Respiratory rate 20.  He was in no acute
distress.  His pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Mucous membranes moist.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear anteriorly.  He had an elevated jugular
venous distention.  His abdomen was benign.  His extremities
showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema and positive dorsalis
pedis pulses.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 5.1, hematocrit 35.2,
platelet count 134,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride
96, bicarbonate 28, BUN 29, creatinine 1.2, glucose 107, ALT
39, AST 34, alkaline phosphatase 160 and amylase 105.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit
Service status post his catheterization with femoral Swan
line placed to follow his cardiac output and wedge pressure.
He was put on milrinone 0.38 mcg/kg/minute and his cardiac
index improved.  He was also diuresed with Lasix.  He
continued on his aspirin, beta-blocker, statin and ACE.  His
Coreg was halved while on the milrinone therapy.  He seemed
to tolerate this well.  There was a discussion of a Hickman
catheter being placed so he could have outpatient milrinone
therapy, however, patient was adamant not to have this
placed.  In fact, most of his hospitalization he was anxious
to go home.  The risks were discussed with him.  Although,
the milrinone increased his cardiac output, he was not
willing to go home as an outpatient with this continuous
infusion.  He pretty much urged the discharge on the 13th.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the patient came to an agreement.  The
milrinone was weaned down and he was asymptomatic and stable
at this time, and he was discharged on his home medications.
Digoxin was started at 0.125 mg po q.d.  Patient, during
hospitalization, had a transthoracic echocardiogram which did
not reveal a thrombus.  This was an unofficial [**Location (un) 1131**] at the
time of discharge and, therefore, his warfarin was
discontinued.  The patient was not compliant in following
PTTs with this.

As his systolic blood pressure and mental status and
functionality was preserved off the milrinone drip, he was
discharged.  He was to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within one
to two weeks.  Although, he did not leave against medical
advice, he was made aware that this was not the optimal
course from our prospective and this would increase greater
risk overall.  He agreed, however, wished to go home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg.
2.  Glucophage 500 twice a day.
3.  Lasix 120 in the a.m., 80 in the p.m.
4.  Lisinopril 20.
5.  Lipitor 10 q.h.s.
6.  Coreg 25 twice a day.
7.  Digoxin 0.125 once a day.
