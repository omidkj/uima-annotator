History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] is a 54-year-old man with a history of AML 11 months
s/p matched related allo SCT with busulfan/cyclophosphamide
conditioning with complications of CMV viremia, GVHD and
hemorrhagic cystitis, and longstanding disseminated TB s/p
treatment, who presented on [**2171-12-4**] to [**Hospital 478**] clinic with
2-day h/o cough, SOB. No fever, chills, URI symptoms,
hemoptysis, chest pain, palpitations, N/V/D, weight change,
urinary symptoms, or change in BMs. He also noted discomfort in
his left eye which had been bothering him for 1 month. Denied
eye pain.
.


Past Medical History:
ONC HISTORY (per OMR):
1. Diagnosed in early [**8-/2169**] with nightly fevers. BM bx
revealed AML. Flow cytometry showed aberrant expression of CD2,
CD7, HLA-DR, CD 34, dim CD33, CD 117, and CD 71. CT scan
revealednecrotic lymph nodes in the superior mediastinum and
periportalregion, and multiple low attenuation lesions in the
liver and spleen concerning for microabscesses from a
disseminated infection.
2. [**2169-8-17**]: Induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and
idarubicin complicated by persistent fevers and extensive workup
ultimately revealing disseminated tuberculosis infection. His
course was also complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation and
hypotension and the development of a severe cardiomyopathy.
3. S/P one dose of high-dose ARA-C at 1.5 mg per meter squared,
lowered dose due to his disseminated tuberculosis, and then he
received a second course of HiDAC at 3 gram per meter squared
dose and developed acute onset of gait instability. No further
chemotherapy given.
4. Relapsed in 7/[**2170**]. [**Year (4 digits) **] re-induction with ME on [**2170-8-13**].
Noted for pulmonary nodules which were suspicious for
aspergillus and empirically treated with Voriconazole with
improvement noted on CT.
5. Admitted on [**2170-10-25**] for maintenance therapy while awaiting
BMT. However, upon admit he was again found to have blasts. He
proceeded with Idarubicin and Cytarabine(7+2) butdid not achieve
a remission.
6. S/P High dose Ara-c with remission.
7. [**Year (4 digits) **] sibling related allo transplant on [**2171-1-8**]. Allo
course c/b increased LFTs of unclear etiology, possibly from
chemotherapy, renal failure attributed to CSA, and received only
1 dose of MTX due to mucositis.
8. Post transplant course complicated by asymptomatic CMV
viremia and
viral/URI syndromes.
9. In [**2171-5-12**] developed diarrhea with e/o GVH on endoscopy.
He also
had hematuria, but no evidence of BK virus. He started
photopheresis.
Diarrhea abated but LFTs rose. Therapy attempted for GVH of
liver using pulse of prednisone and increase in CellCept with
stabilization but no significant improvement.
10. Received 1mg of Pentostatin on [**2171-6-14**].
11. Liver Biopsy c/w GVHD. Started Rituxan for 4 weeks in
5/[**2171**].

Social History:
He is married and lives at home with his wife & children. He is
a machine operator, but is currently not working. He immigrated
from [**Country 5976**] in early [**2144**]. He smoked approximately 3 cigarettes
per day for 20 years and stopped 1 year ago. He does not drink
alcohol.

Family History:
Notable for mother who passed away of myocardial infarction. His
father passed away of liver disease. He has four living brothers
and two living sisters, all in good health.

STUDIES:
* EKG [**12-5**]: Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing
tachycardia has appeared. Voltage has increased in the
precordial leads. T wave inversions persist.
* Echo [**12-9**]:  LV systolic function appears depressed. There is
a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
* Echo [**12-6**]:  There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
* Echo [**12-5**]: Very limited views. There is only trivial
pericardial effusion.
* Echo [**12-4**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %). The right ventricular
cavity is unusually small but is not frankly collapsing in
diastole. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. There is sustained right atrial
collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early
tamponade.
* CXR [**12-4**]: Marked short interval enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette could  represent pericardial effusion or myocarditis.
There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] is a 54-yo M h/o AML, 11 months s/p allo SCT, h/o
disseminated TB, who presented with pericardial effusion, which
was drained.
.
# Pericardial effusion: In clinic he was found to have new
cardiomegaly on CXR, and an echocardiogram revealed a large
pericardial effusion. Mr. [**Known lastname 63305**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a pericardiocentesis
in the cath lab, which removed 1300 ml of serosanguinous fluid,
creating a fall in RA pressure from 25 to 13 mm Hg. The patient
recovered well in the CCU, with no dyspnea. Subsequent
echocardiograms revealed no reaccumulation of the pericardial
fluid. The patient continued to recover well after his transfer
to the BMT service. He experienced no dyspnea, no chest pain by
discharge. The pericardial fluid studies were unrevealing. The
possible etiologies included post-viral pericardial effusion,
GVHD, or TB reactivation. He was sent home with an appointment
for a repeat chest CT on [**2171-12-20**].
.
# AML: On [**2171-11-29**], prior to this admission, the patient
[**Date Range 1834**] a bone marrow for persistent pancytopenia. The marrow
showed no sign of active leukemia. He was continued on
prophylatic regimen of acyclovir, atovaquone, and posaconazole.
He was discharged with instructions to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
on [**2171-12-20**].
.
# History of TB: Mr. [**Known lastname 63306**] recent disseminated TB infection
prompted TB precautions and isolation. Induced sputum was AFB
negative. He refused bronc
