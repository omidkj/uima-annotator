CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  73-year-old white male with
history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, had an episode
of apparent presyncope in his PCP's office in early [**Month (only) 958**] of
this year.  The patient was hospitalized and evaluated.  A
large abdominal aortic aneurysm was found.  CT scan of the
head and ultrasound of the carotids were negative.  The
patient was seen at [**Hospital **] Hospital for AAA repair but was
deemed an extremely high surgical risk and was referred to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a second opinion.

The patient was seen in the office and referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] for cardiology clearance preoperatively.  The patient
underwent a Persantine mibi study on [**2172-3-16**] which was
negative and showed an ejection fraction of 60%.  The patient
was cleared for surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Hypertension.
Hypercholesterolemia.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Severe spinal stenosis with chronic low back pain.
Peripheral neuropathy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Tonsillectomy.
Appendectomy.
Inguinal hernia repair times three.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] smokes 1??????
packs of cigarettes per day.  He was unable to tolerate
Wellbutrin to help him stop smoking.  He uses alcohol

Abdomen, obese, grossly nontender.  Patient unable to lie
down in the supine position secondary to low back pain.

LABORATORY DATA:  On [**2172-4-9**], WBC 5.4, hemoglobin 10.8,
hematocrit 31.5, platelet count 102,000, PT 13.0, PTT 35.4,
INR 1.1, sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 24, BUN
59, creatinine 1.7, glucose 91.  Chest x-ray showed a 1 cm
nodule projecting over the left lung laterally, probable
right infrahilar bronchiectasis.  EKG showed a normal sinus
rhythm at a rate of 75; a technically limited study.  No
previous tracings for comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
following resection of a 12 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm with
a tube graft.  Surgery was complicated by intraoperative
bleeding with an estimated blood loss of 6 liters.  The
patient was transfused 8 liters of blood products, 10 units
of platelets, 3 units of fresh, frozen plasma and 12 liters
of crystalloid in total.  At the end of surgery patient had
palpable DP pulses bilaterally.  He was treated with Kefzol
perioperatively.  An epidural had been placed for pain
control.  However, due to metabolic acidosis, the patient was
kept intubated.  The patient did not use his epidural but
because of his coagulopathy, the catheter was continued until
his coagulopathy was treated.  The patient was treated with
Vitamin K.  He was transfused with platelets and fresh frozen
plasma.

Gram negative rods in the patient's sputum were cultured and
grew Serratia marcescens.  The patient was treated with a 10
day course of Levofloxacin for tracheobronchitis.

Due to massive fluid repletion, the patient became volume
overloaded and was in congestive heart failure.  He was then
aggressively diuresed with IV Lasix.  He could not be
extubated until postoperative day #9.

While intubated, the patient was started on TPN to avoid
postoperative malnutrition.  He was able to start taking sips
by mouth on postoperative day #9 following extubation.  His
diet has been advanced as tolerated without difficulty.

The patient's abdominal surgical staples were removed and the
incision was Steri-Stripped.  He was evaluated by physical
therapy and short term rehabilitation stay was recommended.
The patient had very specific requirements for accepting a
rehabilitation bed.  On [**2172-5-5**] the patient agreed to be
transferred to [**Location (un) 582**] of [**Location (un) 620**] which was also agreeable to
his wife.

At time of dictation, patient's abdominal incision is clean,
dry and intact.  He has bilaterally warm feet with palpable
BP pulses bilaterally.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
after he is discharged from the short term rehab.
