[**Hospital1 1474**], received ASA, TNG, aggrastat and heparin. No BB given

C.CATH Study Date of [**2156-6-26**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated one vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
without
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The LAD and its

diagonal branches were without flow limiting disease. The LCX
and its
OM1 and OM2 branches were without flow-limiting disease. The RCA
was a
dominant vessel with a 95% mid vessel stenosis.
.. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and
left
sided filling pressures (RVEDP=14mmHg and mean PCWP=18)
consistent with
RV infarct. Cardiac output and index were 6.4 L/min and 2.7
L/min/m2
respectively.
3. No left ventriculogram performed to reduce constrast load.
4. Successful placement of 2.5 x 28 mm Cypher drug-eluting stent
in
mid-RCA postdilated proximally with a 3.5 mm balloon and in the
midvessel with a 3.25 mm balloon. Final angiography demonstrated
no
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and
normal
flow (See PTCA Comments).
5. Ventricular tachycardia during the procedure with spontaneous

resolution. No recurrence after restoration of normal flow.
6. Successful placement of 6 French Angioseal in right femoral
arteriotomy at the conclusion of the procedure without
complications.

ECHO Study Date of [**2156-6-29**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional left ventricular
systolic function.  Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis c/w possible right ventricular infarction.



Brief Hospital Course:
57 yoF with episodic atypical chest pain inferior myocardial
infarction found with high grade occlusion of RCA, stented using
Cypher stent.

During cardiac catheterization, was found to have elevated right
and left filling pressures (RVEDP=14mmHg and mean PCWP=18)
consistent with RV infarct.  Patient had 95% RCA midvessel
stenosis which was successfully stented w/ cypher stent and
post-dilated.  During procedure, however, patient had episode of
VT/VF which was self-terminating, thought to be secondary to
severe no reflow.  Otherwise, remaining vessels were clear of
flow-limiting disease.

Patient was started on Lipitor 80mg, ASA, Plavix 75mg,
Lisinopril 20, and Toprol XL 100mg.  Indeed, patient continued
to have occasional episodes of "chest pain" and epigastric pain
without EKG changes, therefore not thought to be due to stent
thrombosis or acute ischemia.  Of note, patient was given SLNTG,
and SBP fell by ~30mmHg, consistent w/ known RV infarction.
Echo found EF of 55%, hypokinesis of RV free wall, but normal LV
motion and only trivial MR.

Patient had difficulty with mobility near the end of
hospitalization, and initially it was felt that she would
require inpatient physical rehabilitation. She was able to work
with PT, however, and was cleared to go home with services.

Lastly, patient was noted to have elevated fasting glucose
levels between 130s-200s on occasion and was given sliding scale
insulin for prophylaxis.  Further hemoglobin A1C was noted to be
elevated at 7.2.  Patient was scheduled for outpatient followup
with [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes.

Otherwise, patient was maintained on outpatient fibromyalgia,
chronic cystitis regimens.
