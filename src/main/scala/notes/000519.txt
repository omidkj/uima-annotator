History of Present Illness:
84 year old male veteran of WWII with a complicated history
including CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, bladder CA, and ANCA+
vasculitis who initially presented to OSH for abdomainl pain 12
days ago. He developed acute onset of nausea and dry heaves and
abdomainl pain which woke him up from sleep.  He was admitted on
[**5-26**] and initially treated for diverticulitis with Unasyn and
gentamycin (which were on until [**5-31**]).  An NG tube was placed on
[**6-4**] OSH stay which was on gravity at the time of transfer.  He
was started on TPN on [**6-6**] (through a peripheral?). TPN
discontinued on arrival. NG connected to LCWS.

Had normal colonoscopy with melanosis amd Int hemorrhoids grade
III in [**2131**], ascending /transv colon not visualized suboptimal
prep.

He is anuric and gets HD-MWF via AVG L arm which was placed by
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 816**] on [**2133-11-4**] ans had multiple IR procedures recurrent
dysfunctions and suspected stenoses ; the last Fistulogram, 7-mm
balloon angioplasty of intragraft stenoses was done on [**2135-4-28**].

Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 **].


Past Medical History:
-CAD s/p Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 5 [**2132-8-8**] (Left internal
mammary artery > Left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft
> diagonal, saphenous vein graft > obtuse marginal 1, saphenous
vein graft > obtuse marginal 2, saphenous vein graft > posterior
descending artery)
-Diastolic CHF
-HTN
-Mitral regurg (1+), Aortic regurg (1+), Tricuspid regurg (2+)
-Dyslipidemia
-Hypothyroidism
-Gout
-Bladder CA (12 years ago)
-Pericarditis (remote)
-Stage IV CKD; largely secondary to microvascular disease of the
kidney, but possibly with a component of atheroembolic disease
in light of persistently elevated eosinophil count and mildly
low complement levels.
-Atrial fibrillation
-Hemoptysis ([**4-/2133**]) thought to be related to ANCA-associated
vasculitis
-s/p right knee replacement

Social History:
Pt is a retired CPA, he recently moved into an [**Hospital3 **]
facility. He is able to maintain ADLs, cares for himself. Pt
smoked but quit 45 years ago; does not drink alcohol currently
and used rarely before his CABG, and has never used recreational
drugs. He is a veteran of WWII.

IMAGING:
[**5-26**]: CT was done which was read as asymmetric cecal wall
thickening, inflammatory stranding of peri-cecal fat.  Appendix
not visualized. Ascending colon epiploic herniation through
right
abdomainal wall defect.
.
[**5-30**] KUB was done for N/V/Ab distention which showed multiple
dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of obstruction.  CT:
Distal mechanical small bowel obstruction.
.
[**6-2**] KUB Persistence of small bowel obstruction.  CT on same
day:
with mild improvement in previously seen SBO.
.
[**6-4**]: Ab XR - six views: Partial SBO with passage of contrast
material into colon, suggests incomplete SBO.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the West 1 service under Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with
ESRD and
near-obstructing cecal lesion.  Initially plan was to obtain a
colonoscopy, but he was unable to tolerate the prep and exam was
poor quality. CEA was elevated.  CXR was without lesions,
non-contrast CT did not demonstrated evidence of metastatic
disease.  A PICC was placed and TPN started while he was kept
NPO. On [**2135-9-10**], he was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who
performed exploratory laparotomy with right colectomy for a
contained cecel perforation. Postop course was complicated by
need for intubated SICU stay for hypotension requiring pressor
support. Gradually, BP improved and he was able to tolerated
CVVHD as well as extubation. Subsequently, he was switched to
hemodialysis 3 time per week. He still experienced hypotension
at times. Anti-hypertensives were held. Diet was not started for
many days due to distension and lack of flatus. TPN via a picc
line was inserted. Gradually diet was reintroduced. He
experienced diarrhea requiring a flexiceal. Stool was sent
several times and was negative each time. The abdominal incision
became erythematous with drainage requiring opening. A wound vac
was applied. The wound grew citrobacter freundii and yeast.
Flagyl and Cefazolin were started on [**6-11**] and continued through
[**6-14**].  He remained afebrile.

He was transferred out of the SICU after several days only to
return to the SICU for mental status changes and respiratory
distress for aspiration. He was reintubated. He was started on
iv flagyl and vancomycin on [**6-19**]. Sputum [**6-19**] isolated
citrobacter freundii and yeast. Ceftazidime was added on [**6-23**].
This was switched to meropenum on [**6-24**]. On [**6-20**], a min bronch
with lavage yielded a sputum spec that isolated the following:
 RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2135-6-23**]):
      10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML. Commensal Respiratory Flora.
      CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    10,000-100,000
ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within

         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
      YEAST.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
