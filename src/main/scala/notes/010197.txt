Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This history is taken from patient and her home aide, Dodi.
.
This is an 88 yo woman not followed at [**Hospital1 18**] with history of CHF
who started having dyspnea 2-3 days ago. She says she was
diagnosed with CHF less than one year ago, and is followed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 121**] in cardiology at [**Hospital3 1196**]. Says that
her symptoms have been progressive over the last couple days and
include DOE, fatigue, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling.
She says she has also gained weight, but when asked to quantify
the amount says that her weight has only increased [**5-6**] pounds
over the last six months.
.
On ROS, she denies fever, cough or sputum production. No sick
contacts. She lives in [**Hospital3 **] in [**Location (un) 55**]. No
history of recent prolonged travel or immobilization. No history
of asymmetric leg swelling, redness or tenderness. Denies recent
history of chest pain, syncope or lightheadness, or
palpitations. As above, she endorses symptoms of orthopnea
(sleeps on [**3-6**] pillows), bilateral leg swelling, abdominal
fullness, and generalized fatigue/malaise.
.
At baseline, she can walk several hundred feet before becoming
dyspneic. She seldom uses stairs anymore. She is not on home
oxygen. She takes care of most ADLs, but has health aide and
[**Hospital3 **] to help with IADLs.
.
In the emergency department she was satting 93% on 2L. CXR
showed pulmonary edema. BNP was 4281. First set of enzymes
showed TropT of 0.03 with CK 98 and creatinine 1.1. Cards was
consulted and did not feel this was ACS; they recommended
against starting heparin drip. She was given 10 mg IV Lasix x1
after which she had good urine output and was admitted to
medicine for further management.

.
CXR ([**2170-2-17**]): Enlarged cardiac silhouette with prominence of
interstitial markings suggestion of airspace opacities in the
lower lung field, which may all represent pulmonary edema,
although the chronicity of this process is unclear. Correlation
with presentation and other comparison to outside priors for
continued radiographic followup is recommended. It is difficult
to exclude an infectious process in the lower lung fields.
.
CXR ([**2170-2-18**]): Although respiratory motion slightly limits the
assessment, there has been apparent interval worsening of
perihilar and basilar opacities attributed to pulmonary edema in
the setting of cardiomegaly and vascular engorgement. Small
right pleural effusion is unchanged, but there is apparent new
small left pleural effusion.
.
TTE (from [**Hospital **] Hosp): [**11/2169**]: normal LV size and
wall thickness, without obvious regional wall motion
abnormalities.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal. The estimated LVEF is 65%. Mild left atrial enlargement.
Mitral valve is myxomatous and the mitral valve is moderately
diffusely thickened. Degree of prolapse is severe. Aortic valve
is tricuspid and sclerotic. There is mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgiation is present. Estimated right
ventricular systolic pressure is 60 mmHg with an RA pressure 5
mmHg.
.
echo [**2170-2-20**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size is normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with
moderate/severe systolic prolapse/partial posterior leaflet
flail. Torn mitral chordae are present. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underestimated. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mitral valve prolapse/partial flail with at least
moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
An 88 yo woman with h/o diastolic CHF and severe mitral valve
prolapse presenting with progressive shortness of breath,
fatigue, now with new oxygen requirements.
.
Her symptoms at admission were most consistent with a CHF
exacerbation, especially given her elevated BNP and CXR showing
pulmonary edema. Slight elevation of TropT (with flat CK) also
supported diagnosis of CHF exacerbation. Also considered in ddx
were acute worsening of mitral regurgitation, pericardial
effusion, ACS, pulmonary process (PE seemed less likely given
history of progressively worsening symptoms, no signs/symptoms
of DVT).
.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled x3. CK was flat and TropT remained
elevated but stable at 0.03 to 0.04. She was diuresed overnight
with IV boluses of Lasix, for total of 60 mg. She had good urine
output and symptoms improved on first hospital day, but there
was concern about persistent oxygen requirement and crackles on
exam. She was started on metoprolol for slowing of heart rate in
setting of diastolic dysfunction and need for increased
diastolic filling time. She was then transferred to cardiology
service for initiation of Lasix gtt.
.
On the medicine floor, received a cummulative total of 80mg of
IV lasix and total net output was 950cc. A dose of 40 resulted
in a BP drop to 92/40, she had previously been
