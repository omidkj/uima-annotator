History of Present Illness:
81 year old male with history of basilar artery aneurysm w/ICH
from [**Hospital **] rehab in [**Location (un) **]. Had ventricular
decompressions here.
.
Patient was h/o agitation since admission there ~2mos ago,
recently stopped ativan 1 day PTA as family was worried masking
repeat ICH. Sent to [**Hospital1 **] today b/c family concerned that pt was
"rubbing at his face" and may have a repeat bleed with increased
agitation. RN at [**Hospital1 **] reports no actual change in MS
recently. Nonverbal at baseline. Documented strife between staff
and daughter. On [**2178-7-9**] the PA writes in a PN that daughter
states "it is ilegal if you give any kind of meds (sedative) to
my father." "I want my father to send out (to [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital) if get anxiety." On this note, his BP was 169/102. Was
on Promote TF at 90cc/hour and IVF NS 100cc/hr. As it turns out,
there are progress notes from [**2178-7-6**] (the earliest provided),
that say "cont NS at 100 ml/h).
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.2 110 94/68 28 95%. Noted to have
total body fluid overload, including pleural effusions. Stable
Head CT without bleed. CXR with increased L pleural effusion and
new R.  HR 90-100 until 7pm when went to 110s-120s, BP 150/100.
Started on nitro gtt and given ativan 2mg IV for concern of
benzo withdrawal. Chronically trached for respiratory failure.
.
On transfer, 134/87 on nitro drip with HR 102-120.  97%, 15/5,
30% Fi02.
.
On the floor, patient appears comfortable. He open his eyes to
voice and is able to nod once that he does not have pain.
Otherwise he is non responsive but withdraws to pain R>L.  The
daughter states that she has been unhappy with care at [**Hospital1 **]
as his BP, edema have not been well controlled.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2178-8-2**]**

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2178-8-2**]):
      Reported to and read back by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 8031**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] AT 0421
[**2178-8-2**].
      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
         A positive result in a recently treated patient is of
uncertain
         significance unless the patient is currently
symptomatic
         (relapse).

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2178-8-1**] 9:00 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Encephalomalacia along the right frontal ventriculostomy
tract and in the right basal ganglia (site of prior hemorrhage).


CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2178-8-1**] 5:57 PM
CHEST AP:
  Comparison film [**2178-7-28**].

There are low lung volumes, limiting interpretation.
Tracheostomy tube is
present. No evidence of failure is seen. Left effusion is
present. Neither
base can be adequately evaluated and infiltrates in these
regions cannot be
excluded.

IMPRESSION: Limited study, Basal infiltrates cannot be excluded.


Portable Trans Thoracic Echo (Complete) Done [**2178-7-11**] at
12:00:06 PM      FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %)
with inferior akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old male with history of basilar artery aneurysm w/ich
from [**Hospital **] rehab in [**Location (un) 5583**] with agitation and total body
fluid overload.
.
Systolic Congestive Heart Failure Exacerbation: He was diuresed
aggressively initially with IV furosemide with improvement in
breathing/anasarca. Negative 11 liters for MICU length of stay.
He was initially started on spironolactone 25 mg for medical
management of heart failure in addition to his lisinopril and
metoprolol.  TTE showed EF of 30% with unknown baseline with
left ventricular hypokinesis and inferior akinesis.
