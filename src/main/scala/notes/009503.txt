Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left sided weakness and chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old man with a
past medical history significant for coronary artery disease,
diabetes mellitus, and dilated cardiomyopathy with severe
congestive heart failure admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
on [**2199-10-24**] with a two week history of increased shortness
of breath and "falling" to the left.

Two weeks prior to admission at the outside hospital, the
patient noted left lower extremity weakness which resolved
over the next few days.  On the morning of admission to the
outside hospital, the patient experienced left arm numbness
and weakness.  He denied any associated chest pain.  In
addition, he "fell over" after exercising.  No loss of
consciousness and the patient denies hitting his head.

In the Emergency Department at the outside hospital, vital
signs included a temperature of 97.8, blood pressure 175/106,
heart rate 90, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation of 96%
on room air.

The patient was admitted to the outside hospital and ruled
out for a MI with a troponin-I of less than 0.05 and a CK of
102.  However, on [**2199-10-25**], the patient experienced lower
chest pressure approximately 5 o'clock a.m.  There was no
associated shortness of breath.  The pressure lasted
approximately 15 minutes and it was associated with new [**Street Address(2) 7093**] elevations in leads V2 through V5 on EKG.

At that time, the patient was given metoprolol 25 mg p.o. x1
and started on weight-based Heparin.  It was decided that he
should be transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for cardiac catheterization.  Before leaving the outside
hospital, the patient had a MRI of his head which showed
multiple areas of restrictive effusions consistent with acute
or early subacute infarction in the right hemisphere.  A MRI
showed no evidence of carotid stenosis.

At [**Hospital1 69**], the patient was seen
by the Stroke fellow prior to going for cardiac
catheterization.  He was continuing to have left arm weakness
at that time.  On neurologic examination, there was a lack of
LT pronation in the left leg and proprioception loss in the
left hand.  CT of the head was negative for hemorrhage.
There were small deep parietal strokes approximately 2 cm in
diameter.  The patient was subsequently sent for cardiac
catheterization.

On cardiac catheterization, the patient was found to have a
right dominant circulation with single vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA and left circumflex had minor
irregularities, but no flow limiting stenosis.  The LAD had
very distal apical thrombus or embolus.  The RCA had minor
irregularities and a lesion in the very distal posterolateral
branch.  Hemodynamics from cardiac catheterization included
cardiac output 4.48, cardiac index 2.24, RA pressure 5, RV
pressure 52/3, pulmonary artery pressure 53/20, and pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 25.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post cardiac
catheterization in [**4-14**], which showed normal LMCA, mild
diffuse disease with up to 50% stenosis in the mid left
anterior descending artery, mild luminal irregularities of
the left circumflex with a small OM-1 with an 80% lesion, a
small ramus intermedius with an 80% proximal lesion, and a
RCA with mild luminal irregularity and 40% mid vessel
narrowing.
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy.
3. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
4. COPD.
5. Congestive heart failure, [**State 531**] Heart Association Class
II.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1. NPH insulin 25 units subQ q.a.m.
2. Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg IV q.d.
5. Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Insulin-sliding scale.
7. Albuterol MDI two puffs q.4h. prn.

smoked a [**2-14**] pack per day for 40 years.  Denies any alcohol
use.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac:  Coronaries:  Patient is status post anterior ST
segment elevation MI.  Catheterization results as above.  The
patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with poor LV systolic
function and apical dyskinesis. The most liely etiology for MI is
embolization from LV thrombus.Patient remained chest pain free
throughout the rest of the admission.  He was continued on his
aspirin, lisinopril, and metoprolol.  An ACE inhibitor was added
following the cardiac catheterization.  During the admission, the
patient was anticoagulated with weight-based Heparin as a bridge
to anticoagulation with Coumadin.

Rhythm:  Throughout the first few days of admission, the
patient was in sinus rhythm with occasional PVCs.  In
addition, he had several rounds of NSVTs during this time
period.  On [**2199-10-27**], the patient had a 45 beat run of
sustained VT.  This was asymptomatic.  Electrophysiology
Service was consulted.  The patient was subsequently started
on amiodarone, and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
approximately six weeks.  He will most likely require an ICD
at that time.

Myocardium:  Patient has dilated cardiomyopathy causing
congestive heart failure.  Although the patient had a mild
volume overload by his hemodynamic numbers on cardiac
catheterization, he had no symptoms of congestive heart
failure.  An atrial thrombus was a concern as the cause of
the myocardial infarction.

A bedside echocardiogram was performed on the evening of
admission during which no thrombus was visualized.  A more
complete echocardiogram was performed on [**2199-10-28**].  It
showed the left atrium to be mildly dilated.  The left
ventricular wall thickness was normal.  The left ventricular
cavity was moderately dilated with overall depressed left
ventricular systolic function.  Left ventricular ejection
fraction was estimated at 20-25%.  The right ventricular
cavity was dilated with depressed right ventricular systolic
function.  There was no aortic valve stenosis or
regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, [**2-15**]+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  Small pericardial effusion was visualized.
No ventricular septal thrombus was identified.

Given his severe dilated cardiomyopathy, the patient will
require anticoagulation.  He was anticoagulated during
admission with Heparin as a bridge to anticoagulation with
Coumadin.  He was discharged on Lovenox to continue until his
INR was therapeutic on Coumadin.

2. Renal:  Patient with no history of chronic renal failure.
He received Mucomyst x2 doses status post catheterization in
addition to general IV hydration.  His creatinine remained
stable throughout the admission.

3. GI:  On the evening of admission, the patient had severe
abdominal pain in the lower region.  This was not associated
with rebound or guarding.  Patient attributed this pain to
"gas".  Bowel ischemia was a diagnostic consideration given
the patient's CVA and probable thrombus in the heart
resulting in the MI.  He was guaiac negative with a normal
