Pertinent Results:
CXR PA/lat ([**2105-2-12**]): The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
and hilar
contours are normal.  There is increased opacity within the left
upper lobe and a smaller degree within the right lower lobe,
which suggest pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
.
CT Abd ([**2105-2-16**]): Consolidation in bilateral lung bases, query
aspiration pneumonia. Stable appearance of infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm. Nonobstructive stone within the left kidney.
No evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter in either kidney.
Stable appearance of neobladder without evidence of perforation,
however, evaluation of the lower pelvis is limited by streak
artifact from surgical clips. Diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.
.
Viral screen ([**2105-2-15**]): positive for influenza A by DFA

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon his initial arrival to the floor, he became tachypnic to
the 30's and 40's with increasing dyspnea, spiked a fever to
103.0 and had an increasing oxygen requirement. He was given
several courses of albuterol nebs which resulted in temporary
improvement of symptoms, but serial ABGs revealed worsening
alkalosis. He was transferred to the MICU for further
management.
.
In this first MICU stay, he was continued on vanco and levaquin
for pneumonia. The differential diagnosis considered included
atypical pneumonia, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1902**], vasculitis, diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage. He was on BiPAP for an unspecified period of time.
He was also given nebs and started on solumedrol. Coumadin was
held. By the next day he was much improved and was called out to
the floor that night. He was on 2L nc at that time, and was
satting 95-96% on room air by the following morning.
.
On [**2105-2-14**], after transfer to the floor, he was lying on his L
side in bed and coughing up thick mucus when he suddenly became
acutely short of breath. Initially, O2sat 85% on 2L, 87% on 5L,
not much improved on face mask, and low 90s on NRB. He was given
nebs without improvement. He was suctioned by respiratory, but
only small amounts secretions suctioned. Chest PT was tried (as
the patient had a strong cough) with some success. He was also
treated with nitro, morphine, and lasix with some improvement.
.
On arrival back to the MICU, he was started on broad
antimicrobials (vanco, zosyn, Bactrim, and voriconazole). With
his immunosuppression from MM in the setting of an acute
infection, he was given 2 doses of IVIG. On [**2105-2-15**], he was
intubated in anticipation of inability to sustain high minute
ventilation. Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed and were
positive for influenza A by DFA. Serial bronchial lavages were
increasingly blood-tinged, raising concern for alveolar
hemorrhage. He was given vitamin K to reverse his INR, and his
Hct was monitored closely. DFA returned positive for influenza
A. BAL bacterial and fungal cultures were negative, so all
antimicrobials were discontinued on [**2105-2-17**].  He was diuresed
with improvement in his oxygenation and was extubated on [**2105-2-22**].
 Since, he has had continued improvement in his respiratory
status, currently breathing well on 3L/min nasal cannula.  Of
note, he has had some hallucinations while in the ICU which have
been treated with prn haloperidol.
.
He was transferred back to the floor on [**2105-2-25**] where he was
weaned off of his supplemental oxygen.  He was cleared by PT/OT
for discharge home with home PT.  Due to his continued
hemoptysis and the patient's concern, his warfarin continued to
be held and he was not put on a heparin drip (since his only
risk factor for thromboembolization was a-fib); he will discuss
resuming this with his PCP.
