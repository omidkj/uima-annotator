Chest xray [**2181-8-25**]: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits. The left upper lobe is particularly lucent, more so than
the right upper lung zone, consistent with history of COPD. No
evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax. Blunting of the left
costophrenic angle is stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) COPD exacerbation: The patient responded well to a COPD
regimen of frequent every 3 hour nebulizer treatment with
flovent, serevent, albuterol, and singular as well as solumedrol
plus levofloxacin.  By the evening of hospital day two, the
patient's respiratory improved to where he did not require
persistent BiPap.  There were, however, 1-2 episodes where the
patient required a few hours of BiPap both of which occurred
during minimal exertion from bed to chair after eating.  This
was attributed to the patient's poor respiratory reserve.  By
the day of discharge, however, the patient had improved beyond
baseline with oxygen saturations 99-100% on his outpatient
oxygen requirement of 2 liters nasal cannula.  He was tapered
from 80 mg methylprednisolone every 8 hours to 60 mg every 8
hours to 50 mg prednisone every day with the thought that the
patient will need a very slow steroid taper given his prolonged
outpatient dependence.  The patient was urged to quit smoking
daily and given a nicotine patch to help with cravings.

2) CAD: The patient was ruled out times 3.  He was continued on
aspirin for coronary syndrome prophylaxis in light of the
patient's previous myocardial infarction.

3) Remote seizure history: The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of primidone.  No seizures were noted during his
hospital admission.

4) Depression: The patient was continued on his outpatient dose
of prozac.  He did not admit to typical symptoms of depression
during his hospital course and reported a stable and good mood.

5) Physical Therapy: The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy who recommended short term rehabilitation during his
stay at the [**Hospital3 2558**].
