Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy on [**2113-8-29**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old woman with history of PAF, COPD, and
hypercapneic respiratory failure s/p trach/peg who is
transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] for management of hemoptysis.
.
She presented to [**Hospital6 10353**] on [**2113-8-10**] with fever
(100.1) and dyspnea and was thought to have a COPD exacerbation.
 She was intubated in the ED for hypercapneic respiratory
failure (ABG 7.23/93/53 satting 80%), had a negative flu screen,
and was treated with steroids and antibiotics.  Labs were also
notable for hct 38, wbc 19, 18% bands, and an INR of 3.3.  She
was extubated on [**8-20**] but subsequently reintubated for
hypercapnia, and a trach and PEG were placed on [**2113-8-22**].  Prior
to reintubation, she developed hemoptysis and was bronched, and
then bronched again after re-intubation.  She was found to have
some bloody secretions in the airways but no clear source of
bleeding was found. Epinnephrine was instilled onto the mucosa
to help stop the bleeding.  Her INR was 3 at this time and was
corrected. She was also started on zosyn at this time.  Her
hemoptysis was persistent, with bloody secretions from the
trach.  She was bronched again on [**2113-8-26**] and on antoehr date,
again with no clear source of bleeding.  Examination of the
upper airway demonstrated no blood above the vocal cords.  She
also had a repeat chest CT on [**8-25**] that showed COPD inflammatory
changes in the upper lobes, unchanged comare. She has been on AC
and tolerates PS for 30 minutes per day.
.
On the morning of transfer, her hct was 25 and she was
transfused 2u PRBC.  Her hosptial course is also notable for c.
diff, for which she has been on po vanc (day 8).

Images:
Bronchoscopy [**2113-8-24**]: no blood on tracheal mucosa, blood seen at
origin of LUL and RUL bronchi.  Airways clear distal to blood.
Blood suctioned and did not appear to reaccumulate.
.
Bronchoscopy [**2113-8-26**]: moderate blood sitting in trachea tracking
down right and left main stem.  Minimal blood noted in segmental
bronchi. Minimal reaccumulation over 45 minutes after
suctioning.  Some slow oozing from tracheal mucosa and mainstem
bronchi.  Epinephrine injected in tracheal mucosa.
.
EKG: nsr, nl axis, nl intervals, TWIs in V4-6, no priors
.
CT chest [**2113-8-10**]:  peripheral multifocal pna/subtle airspace
opacities affecting LUL and RUL, possible atypical pna. mild
mediastinal adenopathy.  ETT in place.
.
CT chest [**2113-8-25**]: chronic copd and fibrotic changes, bilateral
lower lobe small pleural effusions and atelectasis and/or
consolidation, possible mild volume overload.
.
ECHO [**2113-8-13**]:  poor quality, LVEF 60%, nl LV and RV size. TR
gradient 25 mmHg
.
CXR ([**8-29**]): The tracheostomy tube is in correct position, the
tip projects 7 cm above the carina. Normal course of a right
sided internal jugular central venous access line. The lung
volumes are slightly increased. There is a bilateral
predominantly reticulonodular pattern of opacities, best seen
over the middle and lower lungs. In addition, small area of
retrocardiac atelectasis is seen. The symmetry of the changes,
in conjunction with the slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette,
suggests overhydration rather than pneumonia. There is minimal
blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of
a small pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Short-term
radiographic followup is required.
.
CXR ([**8-30**]): Left pleural effusion with atelectasis with
consolidation in the left lower lobe in the setting of
hemoptysis could represent hemorrhage or infection. Pulmonary
edema has worsened and is now mild to moderate. Background
changes of COPD are evident


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old woman with history of PAF, COPD, and
hypercapneic respiratory failure s/p trach/peg who is
transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] for management of hemoptysis.

#  Hemoptysis:  She underwent four bronchoscopies at [**Hospital1 10551**] that were negative for active bleeding or a source of
bleeding, and she was bronched again on [**2113-8-29**] with no evidence
of active bleeding.  Her chest CTs from [**Hospital3 **] were
reviewed and it was felt that her hemoptysis was related to her
chronic lung disease and emphysematous changes.  There was no
evidence of infection or neoplasm, and PE was thought to be
unlikely considering that the bleeding began while her INR was
3.0.  She received 2u PRBC at [**Hospital3 **] and did not
require blood transfusions afterward.  ANCA and [**Doctor First Name **] were
negative and anti-gbm studies were pending at the time of
discharge, but these were thought to be low likelihood.

# Hypercapneic respiratory failure/COPD:  She had respiratory
failure secondary to COPD exacerbation/pna and underwent
trach/peg placement.  She was treated with vanc/zosyn at [**Hospital1 10551**] and managed with a steroid taper and bronchodilators.
She is on day 22 of her steroid taper.  She was able to tolerate
pressure support but would become dyspneic after a few minutes
of having the cuff deflated, though this did allow her to
communicate with her family.

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  She is on verapamil and
amiodarone and was on warfarin as an outpatient.  The warfarin
was stopped i
