History of Present Illness:
79 year old male with severe aortic stenosis demonstrated by
echocardiogram performed [**2163-1-26**] with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.6-0.8 cm2 and
peak/mean gradients of 141/76 mmHg. He was also noted to have
mild mitral stenosis with calcified mitral apparatus and severe
mitral annular calcification. He reports shortness of breath
with any activity, especially when climbing one flight of stairs
and is relieved after 3-4 minutes of rest. He also describes
bilateral lower extremity edema half way up to knees with left
greater than right. He reports difficulty
breathing when first rising in the morning which is resolved
with use of his inhaler. He was referred for cardiac
catheterization. He was found to have coronary disease upon
cardiac catheterization. He is now being referred to cardiac
surgery for revascularization and an aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2163-3-25**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
Preserved LV systolic funciton with LVEF > 55% and not SWMA.
Severe AS with valve area < 1.0 cm2 and severe calcification of
mitral valve - aortic valve interannular fibrosa with
significant MV inflow obstruction. MV area by pressure half time
is around 1.3-1.5 cm2, MVA by PISA is 1.0 cm2. Mean gradient is
7-8 mmHg and peak grad is 14-18 mmHg for Mitral inflow
consistent with severe MS. The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. There is
severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). There is at least
moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 7-8 mmHg) due
to mitral annular calcification. There is no pericardial
effusion. Normal TV and PV. Intact IAS. Normal coronary sinus.

POSTBYPASS:
S/P AVR + CABG. Normally functioning AV prosthesis. No sig AS or
AI. Otherwise Unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2163-3-25**] where
the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass grafting. Please see operative note for details.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 2 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
He did need aggressive pulmonary toilet and was kept in the unit
for several days post op due to respiratory issues. He did use
BIPAP at night and will need a sleep study as an outpatient to
further assess OSA. The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight. He did have post
operative ATN and peak creatinine was 2.4. His baseline was 1.1
and creatinine was 1.5 decreasing towards his baseline at the
time of discharge. The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication. he developed post-operative
atrial fibrillation and was treated with amiodarone and coumadin
tehrpay. He developed serous drainage from his mid sternal pole
and Kefzol was added.  He was afebrile and WBC was normal at the
time discharge with scant old bloody sternal drainage from the
distal pole (mid sternal drainage had resolved). The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 9 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
to home in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.
