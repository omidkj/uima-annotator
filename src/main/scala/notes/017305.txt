Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 18982**] was a
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with known CAD, status post MI in [**2140**],
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, recently admitted from
[**2157-12-5**] to [**2157-12-12**] after an acute inferior posterior ST
elevation MI.  Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed
three vessel disease including 30% left main, 50-60% LAD
disease, total occlusion of the RCA, and total occlusion of
the OM1 with visible thrombus.

The patient underwent balloon and stenting to the OM1 with
TIMI-III flow achieved.  Right heart catheterization revealed
high filling pressures with a wedge of 30.  TTE during the
previous admission showed an EF of 30-40% with severe
hypokinesis of the inferior posterior wall, moderate
hypokinesis of the lateral ventricular wall and diastolic
dysfunction with symmetric LVH.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course on this prior admission
included an episode of Delta MS.  The patient was found to
have a UTI, treated with levofloxacin.  Was discharged to
rehabilitation and then went home.  The patient presented on
the day of admission, [**2157-12-25**], complaining of shortness of
breath.

The patient had severe shortness of breath, one word dyspnea
on the evening of admission.  She was said to be extremely
anxious, unable to give a history to the EMTs.  She was also
noted to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 180/110.
She was tachycardiac to 120.  She was given 40 mg of Lasix
with modest effect in her respiratory status and sublingual
nitroglycerin times four.

In the Emergency Department, the patient continued to be in
respiratory distress, hypertensive, and tachycardiac.
Initially, the patient was treated with nitroglycerin paste,
Levaquin, aspirin, Lasix, Combivent, and Ativan.

At 6:00 p.m., her blood pressure decreased to 67/40.  She was
given a fluid bolus, intubated, started on a dopamine drip.
EKG at that time showed a rate of 130, left axis deviation,
no ST or T changes, poor R wave progression.  Cardiac
echocardiogram at the bedside showed no effusion, no evidence
of tamponade and inferior posterior hypokinesis.  Chest x-ray
showed haziness diffusely in the right lung field, a right
lower lobe infiltrate with loss of the right heart border and
a small right-sided effusion.  There was vascular
redistribution after intubation and improvement of the right
lower lobe haziness.  The vascular redistribution was greater
on the right than the left side.

The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory given
concern for stent occlusion.  At cath, the left main coronary
artery showed mild proximal disease.  The LAD was 70%
stenosed.  The left circumflex had a patent stent.  The RCA
had serial 90% lesions proximally distally total occlusion
and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  Her cardiac
output was 6.6 with an index of 4.3, wedge 30.  PA pressure
was 41/28, right atrial pressure 16.

[**Location (un) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile,
pulse 118, blood pressure 124/84 with a MAP of 104,
respiratory rate 14, PA pressure 40/25.  Foley was 1.7 liters
in the bag.  Vent:  AC 500/12, PEEP 5, FI02 100%, intubated,
sedated, withdraws to stimulus.  Lungs:  With wet dense
crackles, right side, anteriorly and laterally, left fields
clear with diffuse crackles.  Heart:  Regular rate and
rhythm, S1, S2. Abdomen:  Distended, soft, no rebound.  No
apparent bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.  Feet cool.
DP pulse not palpable.  Balloon in place on left side.
Neurologic:  Withdraws to stimuli, moving hands and feet.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 36.9, white count 10.7,
platelets 442,000.  The U/A was negative.  ABG 7.37 42, 265
on an FI02 of 100%.

IMPRESSION:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with known CAD,
status post MI in [**2140**] and again two weeks ago, status post
ST elevation MI, hypertension, high cholesterol admitted with
shortness of breath, respiratory distress, and EW
hypotensive, intubated, and on dopamine for blood pressure
support.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  Catheterization on admission
revealed a patent stent.  A bedside echocardiogram with
inferior posterior hypokinesis and an EF 35%.  We decided to
continue aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, and heparin while the
balloon pump was in place, holding beta blocker and ACE while
the patient was on dopamine and hypotensive.

Pump function:  EF 30%, balloon pump at 1:2, attempted to
discontinue balloon pump early.  Chest x-ray on presentation
was consistent with pulmonary edema.  The patient was
diuresed almost 2 liters after 40 of Lasix IV times three.
The PAD was followed to guide diuresis.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was treated empirically
for pneumonia with levo 250 q.d., vancomycin 1 gram q.d., to
be dosed if trough less than 15, Flagyl 500 t.i.d.  It was
considered to double coverage for possible Pseudomonas given
the recent hospitalization and rehabilitation stay with
Ceftazidime.  This was not done initially as the patient has
a history of a penicillin allergy and the reaction was
uncertain by the family.  Blood cultures, urine, and sputum
cultures were sent.

3.  RENAL:  Creatinine 1.3, baseline 0.9 to 1.1.  We decided
to follow renal function and electrolytes as the patient was
being administered Lasix for diuresis.  The patient was noted
to have an anion gap and nonanion gap acidosis.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  TSH was checked in [**11-12**] and was within
normal limits.  The patient was continued on her Synthroid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On hospital day number two, overnight the
intra-aortic balloon pump was discontinued and the heparin
was shut off.  The patient was bolused times two in hope of
weaning the dopa; however, it was left on overnight.

On hospital day number three, the patient had been extubated
overnight.  She was delirious and agitated overnight and had
to be administered Haldol and Ativan and she was transfused 1
unit of packed red cells.  The nitro drip was off.  The
patient was lethargic but responded to painful stimuli.  She
was tachycardiac with a heart rate in the 118s.  She was
continued on vancomycin, levo, and Flagyl empirically for
suspicion for the aspiration pneumonia and possible sepsis.

On [**2157-12-25**], the patient was noted to be tachypneic to a rate
of 30-32 with loud expiratory wheezes and paradoxical
breathing, 02 saturation 90% on 5 liters, tachycardia to the
120s, agitated.  The patient was given 02 via nasal cannula.
An ABG was obtained off of the nasal cannula that showed the
following:  7.42, 36, 47, saturation 85% on room air, AA
gradient around 49.  Face mask was applied.  Saturations went
to the 90s.  The patient was given 5 mg of IV Lopressor times
two, 40 mg of IV Lasix times one.  A chest x-ray was a poor
quality film with no significant change from prior x-rays to
suggest fulminant CHF or new infiltrate or collapse.

IV access in the right wrist was lost so a triple lumen was
placed in the right groin.  The patient was given nebulizer
treatments.  Her 02 saturations improved to 96% on face mask.
Respiratory rate decreased to 16, heart rate decreased to
115.  The patient was more comfortable on examination.  It is
unclear whether the patient went to pulmonary edema after
receiving 1 units of packed red cells two hours prior or
whether she became bronchospastic.  It was also possible that
the patient had pulmonary edema in the setting of
tachycardia, i.e., demand ischemia.  The patient was placed
on DV prophylaxis and pneumoboots.

On the evening of [**2157-12-25**], the intern on-call in the CCU had
a long di
