History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71yo gentlman who was admitted to the hospital
on [**7-29**] of this year for dyspnea, cough, and some low
volume hemoptysis.  He underwent an endoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3373**] on
[**7-31**].  No endobronchial disease was noted, but a radial
EBUS was performed from the superior segment of the left lower
lobe.  Bronchial washings were positive for adenocarcinoma and
the transbronchial biopsy showed atypical cells suspicious for
large cell carcinoma. He has undergone imaging that includes
both CT of the head on
[**2116-6-17**] that shows no metastatic disease.  CTA of the chest
shows a left perihilar mass that is 4.0 x 1.9 cm.  This mass is
centered in the left lower lobe, but does partially encase the
left lower lobe superior segment PA.  There are also two nodules
in the left upper lobe and a 0.9-cm nodule at the right apex.
PET scan performed on [**8-11**] shows the hilar mass to be FDG
avid
with an SUV of 17.  The left upper lobe nodule is non-FDG avid
as are other pulmonary nodules.  There was no metastatic disease
on this study. He subsequently underwent a mediastinoscopy with
lymph node biopsy performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7343**] at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2116-8-25**],
which was negative for malignancy. He now presents for surgical
resection of his lung mass.

CXR :In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there is
little
interval change.  Substantial opacification of the left
hemithorax persists with the right lung being essentially clear.
 No appreciable pneumothorax.  Gas within soft tissues is seen
in the supraclavicular level on the left

[**2116-9-26**]
CXR :
There continues to be elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
left
effusion and an alveolar infiltrate in the left mid lung.
However, overall the aeration on the left is much improved.  The
right lung is clear.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service for
evaluation and treatment.  On [**2116-9-18**], the patient underwent left
thoracotomy, left lower lobectomy,
arterioplasty of lower lobe pulmonary artery, mediastinal
lymphadenectomy, which went well without complication.  After a
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the
floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley catheter, and an epidural
for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received the epidural with good effect and
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications. He was resumed on his
dementia medications and his narcotics were limited so as not to
promote more confusion.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient had an episode of desaturation into the
80's when chest physical therapy was being performed. He was
transferred to the ICU where bronchoscopy was performed and
secretions were evacuated. The secretions were sent for gram
stain and culture, which grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas.
Otherwise, the patient remained stable from a pulmonary
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. Secretions from
bronchoscopy were sent for gram stain and culture. The patient
received vancomycin and cefepime for empiric coverage for
possible pneumonia. This regimen was scaled back to
ciprofloxacin once the culture sensitivities returned. He will
remain on Cipro thru [**2116-10-2**].

Endocrine: Patient was maintained on sliding scale insulin to
good effect. His blood sugars were monitored routinely.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
