Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyperglycemia / DKA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement (right internal jugular, [**8-20**])

History of Present Illness:
57 year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus with multiple
recents hospitalization and considerable complications of her
disease, hypertension, and [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease with 3 days of nausea,
[**Doctor Last Name **] (~4 times a day), diarrhea, and epigastric pain
([**10-29**]). She reports that she has been taking her Lantus, but
had not continued with her Humalog dosing.  Most recent FSBGs
for her were in the 300s-400s, but she did not inform any of her
doctors about this.  She has had markedly decreased PO intake
over the past 3 days as well.  She also acknowledges that her
allergies have been a bit less controlled as of late.  She
initially stated that her loose stools were bright red in color,
but then explained that she was not sure.  When her vomitous
started to become darker, she was finally worried enough to come
to the hospital.  Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EMS report,
emesis was black/brown. She was very drowsy, but responsive and
arousable.  She was actively complaining of epigastric pain to
palpation, without rebound or guarding.

She was most recently admitted on [**2136-6-16**], initially to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
on insulin gtt for DKA, likely precipitated by a recent URI or
"toe-nail trauma" but was without fevers or signs of infection.
She continued to have difficulty with glucose control throughout
this admission, but was transferred to the floor once her DKA
had resolved and discharged once glucose better controlled.
[**Last Name (un) **] has been involved with her insulin regimen and she sees
an endocrinologist regularly.  Routine colonoscopy was also done
during this admission and was normal.  Of note, she has been
admitted 3 other times this year with 2 episodes of DKA and 1
episode of hypoglycemia.  Prior to that, she had not been
admitted since [**2135-7-21**].

In the ED, initial VS were: 100.8 112 75/49 20 98%on 3L.  She
was initially triggered for AMS,  hypotension, and nursing
concern.  She was started on an insulin gtt at 7 units/hr with a
10 units IV dose up front.  She was given a total of 4g calcium
gluconate for hyperkalemia and peaked T waves on EKG.  A right
IJ was placed and she was given 3L NS IVF, then switched to [**1-22**]
NS with KCl.  Broad antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl
was started.  NG lavage showed greenish-brownish output and NG
was left in place, followed by Foley placement.  Hct stable at
38.4.  U/A showed glucosuria and ketonuria.  CT abd/pelvis was
unremarkable.

.
In the ICU, she is quite tired and complaining of some abdominal
pain.  She is much less nauseated.

.
EKG [**8-20**]-Sinus tachycardia. Intraventricular conduction delay.
Slightly prolonged Q-T interval for rate. Consider electrolyte
abnormalities/acidosis. Compared to the previous tracing T wave
morphology and QRS width changes would suggest a metabolic
derangement. Clinical correlation is advised.
.
CT
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Fatty liver.
3. Soft tissue gas in the groin bilaterally. Correlation with
history of
attempted line placement is recommended.
4. 7 mm left perirectal lymph node. Correlation with history is
recommended
and evaluation by colonoscopy can be performed if indicated.
.
CXR [**8-21**]-The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The right internal
jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. The heart size
and mediastinal contours are unremarkable. Lungs are essentially
clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
.
ECHO-Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**8-23**]-CT-IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
