[**2118-2-8**] Abdominal U/S
Heterogeneous appearance of the right lobe of the liver
consistent with known history of cholangiocarcinoma. Gallbladder
edema likely attributable to liver dysfunction as there is no
evidence of cholecystitis. Trace ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 y/o male with a h/o GBM and cholangiocarcinoma who recently
completed cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy who presented
with fever to 103 at home and lower abdominal pain. The
following issues were addressed during this admission.
.
1. Fever
The pt was admitted after spiking a temp to 103 at home. During
this admission, workup was started to discern the etiology for
his fever. Several sets of blood cultures were sent. One bottle
returned at positive for coag negative staph. He was given one
day of vancomycin but this was stopped when blood culture was
consistent with contamination. CXR and clinical exam revealed no
evidence of pulmonary process. U/A and urine cultures were
negative. Pt was initially started on cefepime. On hospital day
#1, pt had no further fevers and coverage was changed to
cipro/Flagyl for better abdominal coverage. The night of
hospital day #1, pt spiked another temperature and became
tachycardic, subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for concern
for developing sepsis. Pt was stabilized in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and no
infectious source was found. Pt continued to have low-grade
temperatures. He was transferred to the oncology floor. All
cultures were negative and no infectious source was identified.
The most likely etiology for pt's fevers was secondary to
inflammation in his abdomen from his known malignancy. Pt was
continued on empiric cefepime. Abdominal U/S revealed no
evidence of cholecystitis and only trace ascites. There was
discussion of possibly draining his ascites. Surgery was
consulted. After full discussion with the primary oncology team
and surgery, it was determined that paracentesis would be
extremely risky. Pt declined paracentesis.
.
Given pt's worsening functional status, a family meeting with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] occurred and the pt and his family agreed that if
the pt did not improve over the next couple days that pursuing
comfort measures would be the pt's desire. On [**2118-2-11**], the pt
and family decided to pursue comfort measures only. The pt
passed away with his family at his side on [**2118-2-14**].
