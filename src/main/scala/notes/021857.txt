History of Present Illness:
72yo woman with h/o newly diagnosed metastatic cancer (lung vs
esophageal primary) with mass compressing the esophagus and left
hip met presented [**2161-10-28**] with hemoptysis, melana, tachycardia.
Cancer diagnosed 3 weeks prior after patient noted progressive
dysphagia. Pt seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as outpatient who felt patient
was not an operative candidate for curative resection. Patient
was started on weekly Taxol/[**Doctor Last Name **] and XRT treatment(palliative
chemo regimen).  EGD [**2161-10-9**] showing nonulcerated submucosal
mass.  Patient also treated for H. pylori [**9-24**].  Three days
prior to presentation the patient noted onset of a nonproductive
cough without fevers, chills, chest pain.  On the morning of
admission at 1AM, she awoke with cough productive of bloody
sputum.  Later that morning she passed a large loose black stool
x 2.  She has had poor po intake for the past week secondary to
mass limited her ability tolerate solid food.  When she
presented earlier today to [**Hospital **] clinic, she complained of
dizziness/lightheadedness and was found to be tachycardic and
orthostatic, and was referred to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, HR 128, BP 151/49, and Hct noted to be 29.5 (baseline
36-39), INR also elevated to 1.5.  She developed a transfusion
reaction with fever.  She was pretreated with benadryl and
tylenol, and then transfused one unit PRBC.  She also received
3L NS.

GI service was consulted and reported that endoscopy would put
the patient at further risk for bleeding due friable esophagus
secondary to XRT, and limited therapeutic benefit in face of
bleed due to tumor or radiation.  Thoracic surgery consulted and
recommended palliative esophageal stenting after acute bleed
resolved, but not acute surgical management of tumor burden.

Today [**2161-11-1**], patient stable to be called out of ICU setting
to regular medical floor to be followed by the oncology team.

Pertinent Results:
Endoscopic Ultrasound ([**2161-10-7**]):
A 35 x 41 mm heterogeneous mass with irregular borders was
identified at 28 cm on the oposite site from the aorta in the
mediastinum. The mass could not be traversed with an EUS
endoscope. No adenopathy was noted. FNA x 3 with a linear
endoscope was performed--> cytology consistent with non-small
cell carcinoma.

EGD ([**2161-10-7**]):
A submucosal mass 31 to 28 cm which could be traversed with an
endoscope with resistance.

Chest x-ray([**2161-10-28**]):
Extensive consolidation in right middle and right lower lobes
and to a lesser degree in the right upper lobe and posterior
segment of left
lower lobe. These findings may be due to massive aspiration,
infectious
pneumonia, or pulmonary hemorrhage. A more chronic process such
as
bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma cannot be excluded. Follow up
radiographs and clinical correlation suggested.

CT([**2161-10-28**]):
1) Hyperenhancing focus superior to the esophageal mass which
abuts the
carina, right main stem bronchus and esophagus which could
reflect hemorrhage.
2) Large lower esophageal mass displacing the left atrium.
3) Mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy.
4) Extensive alveolar opacities most pronounced in the right
lower lobe which
could reflect aspiration or hemorrhage.
5) Unremarkable aortic bypass graft with no evidence of
aortoenteric fistula.

Transthoracic Echo [**2161-10-29**]: EF 60%. normal LV. trivial mr. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 33904**]l effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
72yo woman with newly diagnosed metastatic nonsmall cell cancer
(esophageal vs lung primary) presenting with hemoptysis, melana,
tachycardia.

1.  Hemoptysis:  The patient initially presented with hemoptysis
and the DDx included esophageal tumor invading trachea or
bronchi, lung cancer, pneumonia vs. aspiration from UGIB.  Her
CT scan on admission was concerning for a hemorrhagic lesion,
and CXR for an aspiration event.  Treatment options were limited
per thoracic surgery.  She was transfused 4 units PRBC to
maintain a Hct >30, and Hct stabilized on the second day of
admission.  The patient suffered a tranfusion reaction
consisting of tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen
saturation that resolved with benadryl and tylenol.  She was
pretreated for all subsequent transfusions.  She had one
treatment of XRT [**2161-10-29**]; chemotherapy was held.  She underwent
bronchoscopy on the second day of admission which showed
extrinsic compression of bronchi, blood in the RLL c/w
aspiration. Patient continued to cough up sputum with dried
blood, felt to be from aspiration. Transferred to the floor in
stable condition.

2.  Melena:  Patient presented with apparent UGIB by history,
but was guiaic negative on exam.  GI was consulted and initially
deferred endscopy unless emergent given risk of bleeding with
friability of gastroesophageal mucosa secondary to XRT and
limited therapeutic options.  The DDx included esophageal tumor,
mucositis secondary to XRT, PUD, esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
tear.  All services agreed that most likely etiology was tumor.
Hct remained stable after PRBC transfusion.  She was continued
on IV protonix.  Diet was advanced to clears on hospital day 2,
but she tolerated little in the way of a po diet given the tumor
burden on her esophagus.
 - continue to guaic stools.
 - will request repeat endoscopy from GI tomorrow to evaluate if
tumor has grown.

3.  Squamous Cell Cancer of Unknown Primary Source (lung vs
esophageal): The patient's palliative treatment regimen
consisted of XRT and weekly chemo on admission.  She received
one XRT treatment on [**2161-10-29**].  Chemotherapy has been held per
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
 - Will continue to address with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] when/if plan to
resume chemotherapy.
 - Will request Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] continues to discuss prognosis with
family.

4.  Coagulopathy, INR 1.5 on admit:  Coagulopathy was thought to
be nutrional given the patient's poor po int
