Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ catheter

History of Present Illness:
85 yr old male with hx of AAA s/p endovascular repair in [**11-29**]
presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with increasing WBC count (to 25.2),
fever to 102 and bulging R groin with clear fluid seeping. Pt is
a poor historian [**2-26**] dementia but denied chest pain, sob, n/v/d.
Three hours after arrival in the [**Name (NI) **], pt noted to be more
lethargic with labored breathing and SBP had dropped from the
100s to the 80s/40s. Pt was intubated for airway protection and
started on a dopamine drip. BP improved to 120s/50s. He was sent
for head CT which showed a lacunar infarct. CT chest/abd
negative for abscess, UA positive for infection and pt was
admitted to the SICU.
.
In the SICU, pt was started on vanc/levo/flagyl. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim was
done and showed an inappropriate response (10.6 --> 19.0) so pt
received three days of stress dose steroids. Cardiology was
consulted given the hx of pericardial effusion on prior CT. An
echo showed that the pericardial effusion was stable in size
without evidence of tamponade. Pt was extubated on HD#3 as his
mental status improved and he has been maintaining his sats on
50% face mask. The dopamine was weaned off on HD#4 and BP has
been stable in the 120s/60s. ID was consulted on [**1-22**] given
that pt was growing MRSA in his urine. Speech and swallow was
consulted after pt was seen coughing after sips of water which
he failed so an NGT remains in place.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
Abd CT [**1-19**]:
1. Interval development of simple-fluid containing collection
within the right inguinal region, and interval increase in size
of two left inguinal fluid collections. There is no evidence of
rim enhancement, surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, or
extravasation of contrast into these simple containing fluid
collections.
2. Stable appearance of aortic endovascular graft without
evidence of endoleak. Stable appearance of infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm.
3. Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
collapse/consolidation.
.
Head CT [**1-19**]:
No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Chronic microvascular

angiopathy. Left basal ganglia lacunar infarction.
.
Echo [**1-20**]:
- Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
- Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
- Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
- Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
- There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
- Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
- There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. No right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
.
RUE LENI [**1-23**]:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the imaged vessels
.
Micro:
Urine Cx [**1-19**]: MRSA, enterococcus
Urine Cx [**1-19**]: MRSA, enterococcus
Right Groin Swab: MRSA
Rectal Swab for VRE: positive
Blood cx: pending
Stool for c diff: negative


Brief Hospital Course:
85M with hx of Parkinson's disease, AAA s/p repair in [**11-29**]
admitted on [**1-19**] from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with fever and leukocytosis
and subsequently became hypotensive and unresponsive in ED with
intubation for airway protection likely [**2-26**] MRSA UTI
.
1. Sepsis: In the SICU, patient was started on
vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl. A cortisol stimulation test was
done and showed an inappropriate response (10.6 --> 19.0) so
patient received three days of stress dose steroids.  Urine grew
out MRSA and pt was continued on Vancomycin.  ID was consulted
and recommended completing a 10-day course.  The dopamine was
weaned off on HD#4 and BP remained stable in the 120s/60s.
.
2. Respiratory failure/Pneumonia: Patient was intubated in the
ED for labored breathing in the setting of sepsis.  He was
extubated on HD#3 as his mental status improved and he has been
maintaining his sats on 50% face mask.  Due to a persistent
elevated WBC and MRSA in urine, ID was consulted.  A possible
pneumonia was seen on CXR, likely ventilator-associated so
patient was continued on Levofloxacin/Flagyl for 10 day course.
.
3. Leukocytosis: WBC trending down. Likely elevated in setting
of pneumonia and urinary tract infection and also high dose
steroids. C diff was negative
.
4. Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine of
1.4-1.5 during last admission. Acute renal failure this
admission is likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis during
hypotension in ED. Creatinine trended down to baseline with
gentle hydration.
.
5. Volume overload: EF normal and with normal E/A ratio so no
clear evidence for heart failure. Patient is 9L over hospital
stay. Patient has been gently diurese after ICU stay and is
almost euvolemic on discharge.
.
5. AAA s/p repair: no evidence of infection of graft, vascular
was involved throughout hospital stay
.
6. Parkinsons: continue sinemet, mirapex
.
7. New lacunar infarct:Neurology consult was obtained while
patient was inpatient. It was probably due to small vessel
disease from long standing diabetes. It is not likely related to
his dysphagia. His swallowing problem was probably from
deconditioning and post intubation. His Parkinson disease was
also thought to be stable. Aspirin was started as stroke
prevention. Blood pressure should be controlled at around 130/80

8. HTN: continue Toprol
.
9. DM: Fingerstick well controlled on insulin sliding scale
.
10. Anemia: Baseline hct appears to be 30
.
11. FEN: On thickend nectar liquid and ground solid(aspirate on
thin liquid). Should have repeat speech and swallow in [**2-27**] weeks
to reasssess.
.
12. Prophylaxis: Sc heparin, PPI, bowel regimen
.
13. Access: right internal jugular, should pull this out after
finishing antibiotic. This should not be left longer than that
as it can act as a source of infection.
.
