88 y.o woman with metastatic [**First Name3 (LF) 499**] cancer to the liver, possible

breath at home. The patient was at home at her [**Hospital3 **]
when her aide noticed her to be in acute respiratory distress.
The aid called her son in law, who is a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] because
the hospice agency was unable to come to evaluate, he decided to
bring her to the hospital.
.
Of note, the patient had recently been admitted to the hospital
on [**4-7**] for tachycardia, cough, found to have a bandemia and was
treated for pneumonia. During that admission, after extensive
consultations with palliative care and given the patient's
underlying oncologic disease, she was discharged with PO
antibiotics and was placed in hospice care the day after.
According to his chart in OMR, the family has been actively
involved in the decision to place her in hospice as the patient
