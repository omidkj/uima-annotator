Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2248**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with history of CAD s/p MI in [**2117**], angina, history of
stents to LAD and LM ([**4-23**]), HTN, HL, PVD, AAA s/p repair, CEA,
CKD (Cr 2.5), severe pulmonary hypertension, HIT, history of PE,
and oxygen-dependent COPD who is transferred from [**Hospital1 4494**] with hypoxia. Patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**4-22**] - [**5-1**] for a planned coronay catheterization and underwent
stenting w/ DES of her left main (known distal 70% stenosis) and
LAD (mid 80% in-stent restenosis (ISR) and a distal 50%
stenosis). Patient experienced persistent angina and underwent
repeat catheterization to assess possible occlusion of her LCX
(known 30% and 60% lesions on initial cath), which showed patent
stents and stable LCX lesions and no further interventions were
done. Continued angina and DOE were attributed to combination of
COPD and small vessel disease. CXR two days prior to discharge
([**4-29**]) was notable for b/l pleural effusions and moderate to
severe pulmonary edema. She was discharged on lasix 20 mg PO
daily w/ the addition of amlodipine to her regimen to [**Hospital 1514**]
Health Care Center for cardiopulmonary rehab.
.
At rehab, patient noticed progressive SOB and episodes of angina
with movement- severe episode prior to admission on route to
bathroom prompting her to call nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] ambulance.
Denies fevers, chills, cough, nausea, or vomiting. Presented to
[**Hospital3 3765**] where initial vitals were T 98.4, BP 122/53, HR
91, RR 22 and O2 sat 73% on RA. Labs showed WBC 8.8 w/ 73.6%
neutrophils, hct 38.1, plts 142, creatinine 2.9 and BUN 35. BNP
442, Troponin was 0.04, CK 64. ABG showed pH 7.43 pCO2 39, pO2
44. EKG showed SR w/ occ PVCs and RBBB, q waves in lead III
unchanged from prior. CXR showed significant left pleural
effusion, mild effusion at right base, and fluid w/in fissure.
Patient was given duoneb with minimal improvement, lasix IV x1
(dose not documented in OSH paperwork), maintained on CPAP, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on a non-rebreather for further management.

.
In the CCU, patient reported she felt comfortable. Denied CP,
SOB, nausea, or vomiting. Reported a leg cramp, which she notes
she gets intermittently. Notes productive cough (unable to
expectorate) for past two to three weeks. No fevers or chills.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
hemoptysis, dysurea, black stools or red stools. S/he denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

STUDIES:
[**5-5**] EKG (OSH): Sinus rhythm at 84 bpm w/ PVCs. Q wave in III
and RBBB. TWI in II, III, AVF, V1-V3 c/w prior.
[**5-5**] EKG ([**Hospital1 18**]): Sinus rhythm at 80 bpm with RBBB and Q wave in
III. TWI in III, AVF, V1-V3 c/w baseline. (Sinus rhythm with
ventricular premature beats. Intra-atrial conduction delay.
Right bundle-branch block. Inferior and precordial lead ST-T
wave changes may be primary and are non-specific. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2149-4-29**]
there is probably no significant change.)

[**5-5**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**4-29**], there is
continued
hyperexpansion of the lungs with substantial, though probably
slightly
decreasing, left pleural effusion. Small right effusion is seen.
Moderate
cardiomegaly persists with some elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure. No
definite acute focal pneumonia.

[**5-5**] B/L LENIS: No evidence of DVT.

[**5-6**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal s
