Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
RIJ placement


History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with a past medical history of DM, CAD, CHF, CKD and
Parkinson's presents with 2 weeks of vaginal bleeding. At time
of initial assessment husband reported that patient was
experiencing intermittent episodes of vaginal bleeding vs
hematuria over the last 2 weeks, as well as headaches and
chills. In the ER patient was reported having 1 tablespoon per
day of vaginal bleeding, but was not wearing pads. Also reported
generalized weakness and intermittent chest pain/dyspnea over
the last 3 days, with occasional headaches. Denies recent cough,
diarrhea, and hemoptysis. Does report chronic urinary frequency
of about 10-15 times per day, which is unchanged from baseline.

In the ED patient was noted to be wheezing at the bases and was
guaiac positive. Vaginal exam was noteable for gross blood
without masses and a normal cervix. Patient was TTP in the RLQ,
but could not further classify this pain. CXR showed an enlarged
cardiac silhouete, but no obvious consolidation. EKG was noted
to be at baseline. Pelvic u/s was negative. CT abdomomen and
pelvis was unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes were negative. FS was
noted to be 33 with the patient relatively asymptomatic, and
patient was given an amp of D50 x1. FS improved to 65. Mental
status started to worsen as patient became progressive more
agitation. Patient received another amp of D50 but mental status
appeared to worsen. Head CT was ordered and patient was given
ativan 1 mg IV x1 for this procedure. She was also given Zofran
4 mg IV x1 and Morphine 4 mg IV x1. CT head was unremarkable.
Thereafter she was lethargic but arousable. She was started on a
D10 W drip at 125 cc/hr and transferred to the ICU. Patient was
transferred to the MICU, VS were 90, 13, 162/78, 100% RA.
In the ICU, patient remained lethargic and became disoriented.
On [**5-27**] mental status deteriation, deemed secondary to morphine
and ativan adminstration/component of hypoglycemia, continued to
deteriate and patient became hypercapneic and was intubated. On
[**5-28**] patient was started on CTX and azithromycin due to concern
for PNA, sputum positive for gram possitive cocci, culture grew
rare Asperigillos; Urine culture + for Garnderella and patient
started on Flagyl. On [**5-29**] patient self extubated and was
transitioned with bipap. saturting in the high 90s. Passed
speech and swallow eval. Mental status continued to improve and
patient was transferred to the floor. On the floor patient
feeling much better. Continues to report pelvic pain and vaginal
bleeding. Reports occassional chills, SOB and cough productive
of clear sputum. Denies chest pain.

CT Head W/O Contrast --
No acute process identified.
.
Pelvis, Non-Obstetric --
Thickened endometrial stripe (5mm) on transabdominal US only. No
gross
abnornmality of the myometrium is seen. Endovaginal US was not
performed at this time due to lack of a language translator for
consent. The decision for TV US will be made following a CT
examination.
.
CT Abdomen W/Contrast -- Preliminary Result+ Dictated ([**1-/8773**])
CT Pelvis W/Contrast -- Preliminary Result+ Dictated ([**1-/8773**])
Normal appendix. No bowel obstruction. Indetermin left adrenal
nodule, stable since [**2190**]. No acute CT findings to explain pain.


Transvaginal US ([**5-30**])
Endometrial stripe appears to be thickened up to 0.7 cm with a
small fluid
collection in the fundus. Endometrial stripe appears to be
irregular without evidence of flow within. Adnexa are not
identified. There is no evidence of free fluid within the
pelvis. There is no evidence of focal abnormality within the
myometrium.

CXR: PA and Lateral ([**5-31**])
Compared with [**2200-5-28**], the ET tube and NG tubes have been
removed. There is an abnormal appearance to the right upper
zone. Differential diagnosis
includes parenchymal opacity, unusual prominence of vessels, or
assymetric
pulmonary edema. There is a small right pleural effusion.
Compared with
[**2200-5-28**], the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Changes in
the right
upper zone and right base and atelectasis at the left base is
similar,
allowing for technique.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with a past medical history of DM, CAD, CHF, CKD and
Parkinson's presents with 2 weeks of vaginal bleeding, and noted
to have ED course complicated by hypoglycemia and altered mental
status.
.
#. Altered mental status: Unclear etiology but presumably
related to morphine and ativan received in the ER as well as
infectious process. [**Month (only) 116**] have been related to hypoglycemia, but
appears unlikely that patient would be asymptomatic at FS of 33,
but then become progressively more agitated as FS improved. CT
head unremarkable. Patient did not improved with narcan, and was
not given flumzenil trial. Patient was intubated for poor mental
status and hypercapnia, and once extubated on [**5-29**], mental
status rapidly improved to "baseline" according to the family.
According the family, patient has dementia at baseline, and is
not oriented to year secondary to illiteracy. RPR was negative.
TSH and B12 were normal. When called out to the medicine floor,
mental status remained stable and was consistent with baseline
per family members.
.
#. Hypoglycemia: Unclear precipitant as no dramatic changes to
her sulfonylurea or insulin regimen. Transiently required D10
drip in the ER, but was rapidly weaned
