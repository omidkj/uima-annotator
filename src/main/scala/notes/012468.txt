Chief Complaint:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80M with COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, and h/o TBM s/p
tracheal stent [**2144**] who presents with respiratory distress. Of
note he was recently admitted to the medical service [**Date range (1) 12721**]
with increased respiratory distress, felt at that time to be due
to mucous plugging. He received ceftriaxone and azithromycin
during that admission, which were stopped prior to discharge and
respiratory status was improved by discharge. Patient developed
increased cough [**5-27**] and started on levofloxacin as an
outpatient without significant improvement. He was initially
evaluated at an OSH where vitals were 98.8 88 115/47 24 95% on
4L. Given 40mg lasix - apparently without benefit. CBC there
with WBC 11.6, 19% bands per OSH records. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ER, vitals were 100.9 114 148/76 98% 3L -> 100% on BiPAP.
 Exam with rhonchi with supraclavicular retractions. CXR showing
mild pulmonary edema. Given vanco, ctx in ED, respiratory
attempted secretions but too thick. IP called - stent is in same
place, plan for scope in MICU. Started on BIPAP and admitted to
MICU for further care.
.
On evaluation in the ICU, pt reports SOB is improved. He recalls
breathing worsened day prior to admission. Denies any chest
discomfort, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, dysuria.

EKG SR @114, nl axis, RBBB +PVCs similar to prior poor baseline
.
RADIOLOGY:
CXR ([**5-28**]):
1. Mild CHF.
2. Tracheal stent appears to lie slightly to the left relative
to the
tracheal contour. A CT of the chest is suggested to exclude a
tracheal stent migration.
.
CXR ([**5-29**]):
Evolving airspace change, particularly in the right mid zone
suggestive of
pneumonia. Generalized peribronchial cuffing suggestive of
left heart decompensation.
.
CXR ([**5-31**]):
FINDINGS: New tube overlies the proximal trachea and may reflect
a
tracheostomy tube. Preexisting Y-stent within the trachea and
main bronchi
appear unchanged. Interval worsening of pulmonary edema as well
as slight
progression in degree of right lower lobe atelectasis with
associated
elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Probable adjacent small right
pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
.
CXR ([**6-1**]):
FINDINGS: Tracheostomy tube and Y-stent remain in place in the
airways.
Interval improvement and pulmonary edema which is nearly
resolved, as well as improving aeration at the right lung base
with some residual minor atelectasis remaining as well as a
persistent elevation of right hemidiaphragm. Minimal patchy
opacity at the left base also likely represents atelectasis,
accompanied by a small pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 80M w COPD (on home Bipap)), pulmonary
fibrosis, and tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent in [**2146**], PVDz
s/p LE stenting on Warfarin, Parkinson's dz, and recent
admissions for similar complaints, who was admitted with
increased respiratory distress, s/p MICU stay.
.
# DYSPNEA: Likely multifactorial from combination of HCAP
(fever, cough, infiltrate on CXR [**5-29**], leukocytosis), acute
exacerbation of COPD from infection (given wheezing, O2
requirement), possible recurrent mucous plugging given extensive
baseline pulmonary disease/bronchiectasis. Acute on chronic
systolic CHF exacerbation (LVEF 40% [**5-/2147**], mild pulm
