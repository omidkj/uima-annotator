Admission Date:  [**2189-9-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2189-9-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2128-11-14**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Cardiogenic shock.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
female status post emergent coronary artery bypass graft on
[**2189-6-18**] with left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to OM, saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery with postoperative
course complicated by pneumonia.  Of note, mitral
regurgitation noted in echocardiogram but no mitral valve
replacement at the time of surgery.  States USOH until today
when patient noted left shoulder pain and acute shortness of
breath.

Patient came to the Emergency Department with saturations in
the 80s on room air.  Patient was placed on nonrebreather,
then BiPAP, 100% with blood pressures 80-60 which change to
40-20.  A right subclavian was placed in the Emergency
Department and patient was placed on a dopamine drip.
Patient was also started on a Levophed drip.  Patient was
intubated in the Emergency Department.  Patient's
electrocardiogram with ST depressions in V1 through V4 with T
wave inversions.  Patient was taken to the catheterization
laboratory.  At catheterization, there was found a left iliac
artery which was found to be occluded, was stented.  Then,
all the coronary grafts were found to be occluded.  Blood
pressure, heart rates dropped to the 20s with a transvenous
pacer and an IABP placed.  Patient was maxed out on dopamine
and Levophed.  Epinephrine drip and dobutamine were started.
Patient's arterial blood gas at that time was 6.99, 5197 and
a bicarbonate drip was started.  Patient was transferred to
the Coronary Care Unit unresponsive.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft [**2189-5-24**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  History of congestive heart failure.  Ejection fraction
40%, 3+ mitral regurgitation.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 q.d.
2.  Lopressor 50 b.i.d.
3.  Lasix 40 q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Questionable drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ex tobacco user, no alcohol.  Lived alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
AVP was 90.  Blood pressure was 100/75.  IABP 1:1 with mean
of 91.  In general, patient was intubated, sedated, diffusely
edematous.  Neck:  Pupils were fixed and dilated with a
swollen neck.  Chest with diffuse wheezing and rales.
Cardiovascular:  3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex.
Abdomen:  Diffuse, distended, no bowel sounds.  Extremities:
3+ edema, cool modelled extremities, plus bilateral large
granular hematomas with a venous sheath in the right groin.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES:  Patient's hematocrit was 18,
compared to 38.3 at baseline. Patient's CK was 25 and
troponin was 0.01.  Patient's last arterial blood gas was
6.99, 5197.  Chest x-ray showed congestive heart failure.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

Shock:  Probably cardiogenic shock secondary to acute
ischemia plus or minus severe mitral regurgitation.  Patient
also with severe hematocrit drop.  Patient was started on
dopamine, Levophed, dobutamine and epinephrine drip.  Patient
also had an IABP placed, which was 1:1 and with a transvenous
pacemaker.  Patient was transfused three units in the
catheterization laboratory.  Patient, however, remained
unresponsive off all sedations with pupils fixed and dilated.
Patient likely had brain death.  Patient's family was
notified of the very poor prognosis and unlikeliness to
recover.  After the case was discussed with the family,
patient's family decided to change patient's status to
comfort measures only status.  Patient was then taken off all
pressors and made comfortable with pain medications.  Patient
was extubated after the family had seen the patient and the
family was in agreement.  Patient soon expired at 10:25 p.m.
on the day of admission with the chief cause of death being
cardiogenic shock.  Patient's family was notified and
patient's family denied wanting an autopsy.
