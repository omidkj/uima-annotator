PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
71 yo female with severe diastolic dysfunction, afib on
coumadin, CAD, severe PVD with chronic LE ulcer and infection
with MRSA who was recent admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] ([**2123-3-30**] - [**2123-4-6**])
for diastolic CHF and COPD excerbation where she was diuresed
with Lasix gtt, and also just completed 14 day course of
Vanc/Levo/Flagyl for her LE infection who was admitted for
hypotension.
.
Prior to this admission, she was eating dinner at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
and vomited at 6 pm.  At that time, she was noted to be
lethargic and somnolent without respiratory distress.  She had
received an extra dose of Lasix that morning since her weight
was up 3 lbs over the past 3 days.  She reports no SOB, CP,
dysuria, cough, only states feeling sleepy and "tired".  She
reports increased in her bliteral LE over the past few days.

In ED, she had a temp of 101.1, WBC 16, lactate 1.9, and
hypotensive in 70's/40's.  She got a stress dose hyrdocortisone
50 mg IV x1, Vancomycin 1 gm IV x1, Ceftazidime 2 gm IV x1,
Flagyl 500 mg IV x1, and 3 L NS bolus with BP response from
70's/40's to 90-100/50's.  MUST protocol was initiated and pt
was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis treatment.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she
got a right subclavian line, and was briefly on Dopamine gtt
from [**Date range (1) **], and her BP has been stable off Dopa since.  She
got about 2.5 L of IVF in the ICU.  She was started on
Vanco/Ceftaz/Flagyl for her presumed sepsis from LE
cellulitis/questionable osteo.

Pertinent Results:
Micro:
BCx: ([**4-23**])-NGTD, ([**4-22**])-NGTD x2
Sputum Cx: ([**4-23**])-Staph Aureus coag +
Swab ([**4-23**]): Heels, tibial wounds: MRSA

cefepime)
Cath tip: ([**4-23**])-Coag negative Staph (oxacillin resistant)
Urine Cx: ([**4-23**])-NGTD

Radiology:
-MRI Foot ([**4-26**]):
1. Right calcaneal intraosseous lesion, most consistent with a
bone infarct. Chronic osteomyelitis is less likely, but
continued followup is recommended.
2. Diffuse subcutaneous edema of both feet and visualized
portions of both calves, a nonspecific finding, but possibly
related to cellulitis

-CXR ([**4-25**]): +PICC placement, L linear atelectasis, small right
side pleural effusion

-Left foot film ([**4-23**]): diffuse dimineralization; no new
fracure, no local bony destruction, possible dislocation of the
second metatarsophalangeal joint.

-NIAS ([**4-23**]):significant SFA and tibial dz bilaterally


Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo F with severe diastolic dysfuntion, a-fib on coumadin,
CAD, pulmonary fibrosis, severe PVD with chronic LE ulcer who
presented with septic shock likely from LE ulcers secondarily
infected.
.
MICU course: subclavian line placed and briefly on Dopamine gtt
from [**Date range (1) **]. She was presumed to be in septic shock secondary
to L shifted elevated WBC.  Other etiology would be
over-diuresis and hypovolemia (but elev WBC does not fit this
etiology).  The source of sepsis was unclear but felt to be LE
ulcers, as blood cx, CXR and UA were not revealing.  She
received 2.5 L of IVF in the ICU.  She was continued on
Vanco/Ceftaz/Flagyl for her presumed sepsis from LE
cellulitis/questionable osteomyeltis. No Blood Cx or Urine Cx
grew an organism.
.
1)Foot ulcer/infection: Pt likely had re-infection of the LE
wound after completing a 14 day course of Vanc/Levo/Flagyl.  Pt
got a non-invasive art studies this hospitalization with
sigfnificant SFA and tibial dz.  [**Date range (1) **] and [**Date range (1) **] surgery
followed in house.  Recommendations were for local wound care,
with systemic antibiotics, and outpatient follow-up for
continued discussions of re-vascularization/angiogram.  Swabs of
L and R heel and L great toe and tibial wounds revealed MRSA and
Proteus species (sensitive to 3rd/4th gen cephalosporins, but
resistant to FQ, gent).  [**Date range (1) **] was unable to probe to bone on
their exam.  An x-ray of the L foot showed no evidence of
osteomyelitis.  An MRI was also obtained which showed possible
intraosseus bone infarct of L calcaneus but no clear evidence
for osteomyelitis.  A follow-up xray should be obtained after
patient finishes course of antibiotics.
-- patient will finish 2 week course of Vanc/Ceftaz/Flagyl, PICC
line placed.
-- Vanc trough sl elevated (25), changed to 750 mg q24.
-- all blood cx were NGTD.
.
2)Hemodynamics: Pt was briefly (< 36hrs) on pressors (dopamine)
for BP support in MICU.  She remained basically euvolemic on the
medical [**Hospital1 **] requiring no pressors and just her maintenance
diuresis.
-- In the past, she required Lasix gtt for diuresis as she is
very sensitive to lasix.
.
3)Cardiovascular:
Pump: Pt with severe diastolic dysfunction and very sensitve to
lasix bolus.  Goal was BP/HR control.
-- Patient did not require IV lasix in and was restarted on her
oupatient dose prior to discharge.  She was euvolemic on
physical exam.
-- Her lisinopril 5 mg po daily was also restarted prior to
discharge for optimum BP control.
-- Metoprolol was titrated up throughout her stay for better HR
control (see below)
.
Ischemia:
-- She was continued on BB, ASA, simvastatin.
.
Rhythm:
-- Afib throughout stay.
-- Her dose of metoprolol was titrated up for better HR control,
she was d/c'd on 37.5 mg tid with HR in 80's.
-- For anti-coag the patient was placed on warfarin 5 mg po qhs
(goal INR [**3-11**]), she should have INR checked in [**3-11**] days after
discharge.
-- amiodarone has been discontinued during the last admission
for concern of pulmonary toxicity.
.
5)Pulm: Pt h/o COPD/[**Date Range 105496**]/pulmonary fibrosis.  Some wheezing
noted in ICU but was treated successfully withn Albuterol and
Ipratropium nebs PRN
.
6)DM: The patient's glargine 14 units was stopped and she was
switched to NPH 14 units in AM as she had low sugars in AM and
high at night.  She was maintained on HISS prior to meals and at
bedtime.
.
7)Pain: The patient had escalating pain on medical [**Hospital1 **] and
