.
EKG: NSR, inferior Q waves, diffuse TWI
.
CXR ([**12-1**]): New bibasilar parenchymal opacities, which likely
represent developing pneumonia. Probable small right pleural
effusion.
.
CXR ([**12-3**]): In comparison with the study of [**12-1**], allowing for
differences in technique, there is little overall change.
Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with atelectasis, though
supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely excluded.
.
Renal U/S ([**12-2**]): No hydronephrosis. Stable appearing simple
renal cysts bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 62F with asthma and MMP p/w wheezing and SOB, with
CXR concerning for PNA and ARF.
.
# Asthma exacerbation: The patient presented in the ED with SOB
and did not respond adequately to nebulizers initially.  She was
admitted to the MICU for SOB and given IV methylprednisolone
125mg q8h, standing and prn nebs, and supplemental O2.  She
responded after a short stay and had markedly decreased
wheezing, and was then transferred to the medical floor.  She
was transitioned to po prednisone and discharged on a two week
prednisone taper and oral inhalers.
.
# PNA: Patient was found to have a LLL infiltrate, and though
she did not have clinical signs consistent with pneumonia, she
was treated with levofloxacin empirically and discharged on a
short course.
.
# CRF: Patient has CRI at baseline, likely secondary to both DM
and hypertensive nephropathy.  A renal U/S was obtained which
showed no hydronephrosis.  The patient was also in CHF and this
may have also contributed to her renal failure.  Renal was
consulted and felt that she would likely require dialysis within
the next few months.  An upper extremity venous mapping study
was also obtained at their request.  Medications were renally
dosed.
.
# CAD: Patient has a history of CAD and a low EF of
approximately 36% based on a recent stress MIBI.  Metoprolol was
initially held in the setting of an asthma exacerbation but
restarted prior to discharged.  She tolerated its re-initiation
well.  She was continued on plavix, aspirin, and a statin.
.
# Anemia: Patient has an anemia of chronic inflammation and was
also thought to be epo deficient.  She was started on tiw epo SC
injections per renal reccs.  Her iron supplements were d/c'd
because she is not iron deficient.
.
# DM:  Patient was maintained on an ISS and her glipizide was
held during hospitalization.
.
# EKG changes: The patient does have a h/o with inferior Q waves
noted on EKG. She had a slight elevation in troponin (in setting
of worsened renal function) and slight CK elevation (negative
MB) on admission.  She remained stable from a cardiac
perspective, however.
.
# HTN: As above with metoprolol.
.
# Schizoaffective d/o: Patient was continued on aripiprazole,
citalopram.  Her outpatient psychiatrist was also contact[**Name (NI) **] and
a f/u appt with him was scheduled.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient's statin was continued.
