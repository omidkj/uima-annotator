Imaging: CXR: bilateral fluffly infiltrates c/w pulmonary edema

EKG: unchanged from previous, no signs of ischemia


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and found to be in pulmonary edema.  He was sent
to the SICU.  He received 100mg IV lasix with good effect.  His
blood pressure was controlled with IV medications including
nitroglycerin Gtt.  His pulmonary status quickly improved and he
was transferred to the floor.  He was started on nifedipine for
his blood pressure control and this was titrated up to 90mg
daily for the ext release pill.  There was concern about renal
artery stenosis, and an ultrasound of the graft confirmed this.
He then had an angiogram to further evaluate this and it was
negative for renal artery stenosis.  We then decided to treat
him with optimal medical management.  It was decided to obtain a
renal biopsy to rule out rejection.  This demonstrated evidence
of interstitial nephritis which was likely secondary to his
bactrim.  We therefore stopped the bactrim.  His Cr trended down
over the next few days from a peak of 4.8 to 4.2 prior to
discharge.  He was tolerating a diet, ambulating, and making
good urine.  He will continue on the rest of his
immunosuppresives and prophylactics.  He was started on
pentamadine for PCP prophylaxis, and this will be continued on a
monthly basis.  His blood pressure will be further managed as an
outpatient and repeat labs will be done on monday [**2141-10-30**].
