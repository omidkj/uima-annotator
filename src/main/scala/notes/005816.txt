HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old man with a
history of ventricular tachycardia status post ICD
placement in [**2106**], aortic valve replacement and atrial
fibrillation as well as diabetes mellitus type 2, who
presents with probable cellulitis at the site of his ICD
placement.
It was recently discovered that the generator of the ICD was
end-of-life, so approximately 6 weeks prior to admission, it was
replaced.  The patient did well until about two days prior to
admission when he noticed an increased inflammation, redness
and tenderness at the site.  He denies fevers, chills, cough,
chest pain, shortness of breath, but does say that he has had

In the distant past, he had had two episodes of subacute
bacterial endocarditis and subsequently has been taking chronic
PCN-VK. The patient also states that his discomfort at
the time of admission is not similar to when he had subacute
bacterial endocarditis.  He states that ordinarily he is
active without chest pain, shortness of breath or
palpitations.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post ventricular tachycardia status post ICD
placement in [**2106**]; status post a generator replacement on
[**2109-7-19**].
2.  Status post two episodes of subacute bacterial
endocarditis in [**2099-4-12**] of a bicuspid aortic valve, on chronic
PCN- VK.
3.  Status post aortic valve replacement with ST. Jude's
valve in [**2100**].
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
6.  Anxiety.
7.  Prostate cancer status post brachy therapy.
8.  Left knee arthroscopy.
9.  Markedly decreased ejection fraction in [**5-/2107**] with mild
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg q. day.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg twice a day.
3.  Losartan 25 mg q. day.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg q. day.
5.  Glyburide 5 mg q. day.
6.  PCN-VK 500 mg four times a day.
7.  Ativan 2 mg three times a day.
8.  Coumadin 8 mg q.o.d., 6 mg q.o.d.
9.  Meclizine 25 mg three times a day.
10. Lipitor 10 mg q. day.

ALLERGIES:   Allergic to Ancef.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile at 97.4 F.; 140/72; 84; 20;
and 98% on room air.  In general, in no acute distress.
Appears comfortable but anxious.  HEENT:  Mucous membranes
were moist; no scleral icterus.  Neck supple without jugular
venous distention or carotid bruit.  Lungs clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  In atrial fibrillation
with metallic S2 at the right upper sternal border. No AI
Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities without edema, two plus dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibial bilaterally.  The chest has a mildly
indurated erythematous site at the site of the ICD pocket.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 8.7, hemoglobin 37.0,
platelets 227, PT 16.8, PTT 51.7 and INR of 2.0 on discharge.
Sodium 137, potassium 3.9, chloride 101, bicarbonate 28, BUN
18, creatinine 0.9.

Six blood cultures, one fungal culture and one urine culture:
All no growth.

Gentamicin peak on [**2109-9-3**], 5.1 and trough 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  For his coronary artery disease, the
Lopressor, Losartan and Lipitor were continued.  The patient
had no active coronary artery problems during this admission.

2.  CHF:  The patient, per an echocardiogram in [**2105**], had an
ejection fraction of 29%.  The Lopressor and digoxin were
continued.  The dig level was checked and revealed to be 1.0.
The patient had no evidence of congestive heart failure on
this admission.

3.  Electrophysiology:  The patient was continued on
Amiodarone 400 mg q. day and remained in atrial fibrillation,
awaiting future cardioversion.  He was primarily V-paced at 60
bpm.

4.  Infectious Disease:  The patient received an Infectious
Disease consultation on the day of admission who recommended
that Vancomycin and Gentamicin be started, the Vancomycin for
a possible Staphylococcus infection in the ICD site and the
Gentamicin to cover any Gram negative which might have seeded
his blood stream from the prostate instrumentation.  On
administration of the Vancomycin, the patient became acutely
dyspneic with decreased blood pressure as well as nausea and
underwent rapid recovery with administration of steroids,
epinephrine, Benadryl and oxygen.  The patient underwent an
emergent femoral line placement and was admitted to the
Cardiac Care Unit overnight for monitoring.

Also, during that day, the patient lost intravenous access,
and the femoral line would have to be pulled the following
day.  After this episode, the patient was changed to
Linezolid 600 mg q. 12 hours p.o. and Gentamicin q. eight
hours intravenously, 100 mg, via a PICC line.  This combination
was tolerated well by the patient and he was discharged on this.

5.  Hematologic:  The patient was covered with intravenous
heparin drip while his PTT ranged from 50 to 70.  There was never
any bleeding into the pocket and on [**9-2**], the patient began to
receive his Coumadin again to a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.0.  The
patient was allowed to be discharged with an INR of 2.0 and the
heparin was discontinued at that time.

6.  Access:  The patient had an issue on the 19th whereby he
lost peripheral access and a central line was not placed
secondary to concerns about the risks for infection.  Blood
draws were attempted multiple times by house staff, the IV
teams as well as the Electrophysiology Service fellow.  The
patient requested that he not be exposed to any more attempts
at blood draw until the PICC was placed.  The PICC was placed
the following day on [**9-2**] and remained clean and useful for
access.

7.  Endocrine:  The patient was maintained at blood sugars in
the low 100s to 170s on his Glyburide 5 mg q. day as well as
a coverage of insulin sliding scale.

The patient was discharged in good condition on [**2109-9-5**],
with the diagnosis of presumed cellulitis.  The erythema was much
improved on the date of discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q. h.s.
2.  Gentamicin 100 mg intravenous q. eight hours; total 2 wks.
3.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Linezolid 600 mg p.o. q. 12 hours; total 4 wks.
5.  Meclizine 25 mg p.o. three times a day.
6.  Atorvastatin 10 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  PCN-VK 500 mg p.o. four times a day.
8.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q. day.
9.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q. day.
10. Losartan 25 mg p.o. q. day.
11. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Ativan 2 mg p.o. q. day.

His creatinine was 0.9 and BUN 18 on the day of discharge and
INR was 2.0.

[**2109-9-19**], at 01:30 p.m.
2.  The patient is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] on
