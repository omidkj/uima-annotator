CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
69 year old man s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval ptx
STUDY: Single portable AP chest radiograph.

INDICATION: Status post mitral valve replacement, please
evaluate for pneumothorax
COMPARISON: [**2124-7-5**].

FINDINGS: Study is limited by tubing from breathing mask
overlying the right apex which is the region of interest. Subtle
lucency remains in this area, however, exact extent of right
apical pneumothorax is indeterminate. There is no shift in the
mediastinum to suggest a tension component. The lungs are
otherwise clear. There is a small left pleural effusion. Median
sternotomy wires remain intact.
IMPRESSION: Limited radiograph given overlying tubing in the
right apex. However, there is likely unchanged to slight
improvement of right apical pneumothorax and repeat radiograph
is recommended after overlying tubing has been removed.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Dilated RA.
A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into
the RV. Normal interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma
in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Eccentric MR jet. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be atrial fibrillation. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass
data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is hypokinesis
of the mid to apical segments of the septal and lateral walls).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
mitral valve prolapse of the anterior and posterior leaflets. An
posteriorly eccentric, directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation and a centrally directed jet is seen . The
mitral valve annulus is dilated measurng 4.5 cm in the
transcommisural view and 5.4cm in the anterior-posterior view.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including epinephrine and
phenylephrine and was in a sinus rhythm.
1. There is a mitral valve ring in place, gradient across the
mitral valve is1mmHg with a CO of 3.5L/min. The PHT 47ms, with a
MVA of 2.4cm2.
2. There is global left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an
estimated LVEF of 35 %.
3. Right ventricular systolic function is abnormal; the RV
appears moderatly dilated and moderately hypokinetic
post-bypass.
4. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation..
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
