History of Present Illness:
62 yo female, with severe (stage 4) COPD, who presented with
worsening dyspnea at rest for 2-3 days prior to admission (she
is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for COPD).  She was admitted to the
floor on [**12-5**] with shortness of breath, productive cough, and
low grade fever.  Prior to this, she had been on a slow steroid
taper for 1-2 months (tapered to 10mg 2 days prior to
admission).  One day prior to admission, she was seen in the ED
and given IV solumedrol, started on Z-pack, and discharged on 40
mg Prednisone.  She returned a day later with no improvement in
her symptoms (cough productive of yellow sputum, sob, wheezing,
labored breathing), and was admitted at this time for management
of COPD flare.  At this time, she was 83% RA (improved to 94% on
4L) with a peak flow of 100 L/minute.  She was given solumedrol,
continued on nebs/MDI/antibiotics.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  COPD flare secondary to UTI: At admission she had a
saturation of 83% on RA (improved to 94% on 4L) with a peak flow
of 100 L/minute.  She was given solumedrol, continued on
nebs/MDI/antibiotics.  She was stable on the floor for
approximately 48 hours.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on
[**12-9**] for hypercarbic respiratory failure (ABG on 2L 7.28/78/53)
and was maintained on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
and monitored overnight.  She did well, and was transferred back
to the floor the following day, satting adequately on 6L NC.
She remained on IV steroids at time of transfer back to the
floor.  She was relatively comfortable, able to speak short
sentences.  She was continued on IV steroids for two days due to
continued wheezing.  The day prior to discharge she was
transitioned to PO Prednisone as she was no longer having
wheezes.  She tolerated the PO prednisone and was felt ready for
discharge home on a slow steroid taper.  She was s/p a 5 day
course of azithromycin and it was felt there was no additional
need for antibiotics.  She was afebrile for the course of her
admission on the hospital floor.  She was continued on
nebulizers.  Her albuterol was titrated down secondary to
tachycardia.  She was continued on inhalers and theophylline.
She was discharged on inhalers, home nebulizers, her home
medications, and home O2.
2.  Tachycardia: She was tachycardic to the 130s it was felt to
be likely due to frequent albuterol with a possible component of
anxiety.  She was monitored on telemetry and the tachycardia was
sinus.  Her albuterol nebulizers were titrated down to decrease
her tachycardia.
3.  Osteoporosis - She was continued on fosamax, calcium
supplements/vit D.
4.  Cataracts - She used her own steroid drops while she was in
the hospital.
