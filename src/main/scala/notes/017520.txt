Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing robotic left
partial nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. The
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable
condition.  On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated
for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. However, the patient was
noted to have increasing post-operative hypoxia.
Intraoperatively, he received 6 L of IVFs and was noted to desat
to 80s on 4LNC post-operatively, prompting transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for interval managment.
.
The patient's exam and presentation were most consistent with
respiratory compromise that was multifactorial and secondary to
his known COPD, scoliosis, and splinting from surgery-associated
pain.  His oxygen saturation and breathing improved with
bronchodilator therapy and he was transferred back to the
surgical service on POD2.
.
On POD 3, the patient ambulated, was restarted on home
medications, basic metabolic panel and complete blood count were
checked, pain control was transitioned from PCA to oral
analgesics, diet was advanced as tolerated. On POD5, JP and
urethral catheter (foley) were removed without difficulty. The
patient passed a void trial with voided volumes greater that
post void residuals. The remainder of the hospital course was
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] in 3 weeks.
