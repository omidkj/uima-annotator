Intra-op echo [**2121-10-23**]
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Turbulence on color flow Doppler and an
increased velocity (`2 m/sec) by Doppler were demonstrated in
the pulmonary artery however a PDA was NOT visualized by TEE or
epi-aortic scanning.

POSTBYPASS
There is preserved biventricular systolic function. The study is
otherwise unchanged from prebypass. Elevated PA velocities
remain.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2121-10-23**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 3.  Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
He did return to the operating room within hours of arrival to
the CVICU for re-exploration for bleeding.  He was loaded with
Plavix 3 days preop.  Hemostasis was achieved and the patient
returned to [**Location 42137**].  Vancomycin was used for surgical antibiotic
prophylaxis, given his preoperative length of stay of greater
than 24 hours.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  His chest tubes were discontinued and he
did develop right sided pneumothorax.  Bedside tube thoracostomy
was performed, and the right lung re-expanded.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  He had a tiny
right sided pneumothorax on CXR, which was stable at the time of
discharge.  He also developed a brief burst of atrial
fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm with lopressor.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 4, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to home in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
