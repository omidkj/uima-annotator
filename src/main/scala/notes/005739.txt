Imaging:

CT torso ([**2189-4-23**]): 1. Multiple thoracic vertebral fractures,
including comminuted, displaced burst fracture of T10 vertebra
with narrowing of the spinal canal due to the retropulsed
fragment and listhesis at the T9-T10 level. Additional probable
epidural hematoma at this level. Findings were discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of image acquisition and interpretation
(12:20 p.m.).
2. Fractures of T7, T9, and T11; bilateral ribs, sternum and
left scapula.
3. Mediastinal and retroperitoneal hematoma and retroperitoneal
gas, without evidence of aortic injury. Findings are likely
related to the adjacent thoracic vertebral fracture and
associated vacuum effect.
4. Bilateral hemothorax. Tiny basilar left-sided pneumothorax.
5. No evidence of solid organ injury or pneumoperitoneum.

Chest/Abd CT: 1. Small to moderate sized bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis. 2. Fixation hardware seen
at the T7 through L1 levels with burst fracture at T10 again
noted. No evidence of adjacent fluid collections.

TTE ([**2189-4-28**]): 1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is a questionable, high
membranous ventricular septal defect (VSD).
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.
4. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Head CT [**2189-4-29**] : 1) Right occipital epidural hematoma with an
overlying non-displaced skull fracture, subdural hemorrhage
along the posterior falx cerebri, and hemorrhagic contusion at
the right frontal lobe remain stable in appearance since
[**2189-4-25**].
2) Small amount of residual hemorrhage at the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle.
3) Interval development of a 4-mm displacement of the septum
pellucidum to the right, with no overt CT features of cerebral
edema - probably a result of "negative mass effect" secondary to
the large right craniectomy.
4) Previously described hemorrhagic foci of diffuse axonal
injury at the posterior aspect of the brainstem now appear less
conspicuous.

CT Tspine [**2189-4-29**]: Burst fracture at the T10 vertebral body with
a small retropulsed fragment, compression fracture at the body
of T7, and paraspinal soft tissue swelling at T9-T11 levels
remain unchanged in appearance. There is now posterior metallic
fixating hardware spanning from T7-T12 levels inclusively. A
left pedicle screw is present at T9. Bilateral pedicle screws
are noted at T7, T8, and T12 levels. Laminectomy has been
performed at T10 level. The pedicle screws appear well-placed
within the confine of the pedicles and the vertebral bodies.

CTA ([**2189-5-5**]): There are multiple filling defects within the
right
major branches of the pulmonary arteries including the right
upper segment, and filling defects within the lower segments
consistent with pulmonary emboli. No filling defects are
identified on the left. There is a small left pleural effusion
with associated atelectasis. The heart and other great vessels
of the mediastinum are only remarkable for atherosclerotic
disease. NG tube is in the stomach. 2. Multiple fractures with
thoracic spine fixation rods.

CXR ([**2189-5-7**]): A feeding tube tip is in the stomach. The right
subclavian line tip is in distal superior vena cava. The left
lower lobe atelectasis is unchanged. There is no pleural
effusion or congestive heart failure. The recent surgery changes
are stable.

Abd u/s ([**2189-5-7**]): 1. No evidence of liver abscess.
2. Small fluid collections around that the bony implant in the
subcutaneous tissues in the right lower quadrant.

HCT ([**2189-5-7**]): Somewhat limited study due to motion.
Postoperative changes and right craniectomy, with prior
contusion in the right frontal lobe. Unchanged appearance of
small right epidural hematoma in the posterior fossa with skull
fracture. No new intracranial hemorrhage.

CXR ([**2189-5-10**]): NGT placement (removed just after exam):
+atelectasis, no PNA

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Small to moderate bilateral
pleural effusions with associated atelectasis are seen. No focal
consolidations are identified. Several small mediastinal lymph
nodes are seen, however, none appear to meet CT criteria for
pathological enlargement. The heart and great vessels appear
unremarkable.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder,
pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear
unremarkable. There is no evidence of free fluid or free air
within the abdomen.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum and sigmoid appear
unremarkable. Foley catheter is noted within the bladder. There
is a small amount of air within the bladder, likely secondary to
catheterization. Subcutaneous chains noted in the soft tissue
overlying the pelvis.
BONE WINDOWS: Fixation hardware is seen from the T7-L1 levels.
Displaced burst fracture of T10 vertebral body is again
identified. Cortical defect seen in the right posterior superior
iliac crests, possibly representing bone donor site. Evaluation
of the hardware is limited by streak artifact, however, no
adjacent fluid collections or lucency are identified.
Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
IMPRESSION:
1. Small to moderate sized bilateral pleural effusion
