Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
PICC line placement
Hemodialysis
Transfusion of one unit packed red blood cells


History of Present Illness:
A [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with past medical history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, recent
admission [**Date range (1) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal failure
with decision to initiate hemodialysis at that time and hospital
stay complicated by left lower lobe Moraxella pneumonia
presenting with altered mental status.  Per her daughter, the
patient was home this past week and accidentally took trazodone
50 mg two days prior to admission, which had been discontinued
due to confusion.  Her confusion/visual hallucinations improved
the day prior to admission.  She complained of increased
productive cough and oxygen requirement (previously intermittent
2L NC, now continuous) over the past two days, responding to an
increase in nebulizer treatments.  The patient was noted to be
lethargic this afternoon, responsive to sternal rub.  When
aroused, she was oriented x 3 and moving all extremities well,
however.  The patient was noted to be "cold."  She has not
complained of recent fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, erythema around line.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 96, HR 63, BP 77/55, RR 18 SaO2 98%
(oxygen not documented).  Per report, patient had poor
respiratory effort, became apneic, and was subsequently
intubated.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and left
lower lobe pneumonia.  Head CT negative for acute process.  A
right femoral line was placed for access.  She was given
etomidate and roccuronium for intubation, vancomycin 1 gm IV x
1, zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1, 1L NS.  The patient was started on
levophed for hypotension peri-intubation, off within half an
hour.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is responsive to tactile stimuli.

MICRO:
[**2131-12-24**] Sputum Culture:  MORAXELLA CATARRHALIS.    MODERATE
GROWTH.

Studies:
[**2131-12-28**] CT CHEST:
1. Simple bilateral pleural effusions are moderate on the left
and small on the right. No definite underlying consolidation is
seen.
2. Recommend three-month followup for right apex lesion with
internal
calcification, which may represent scarring, although underlying
neoplastic process cannot be excluded.
3. Moderate-to-severe coronary artery atherosclerosis is most
prominent in
the left anterior descending artery.
4. Small pericardial effusion causes no mass effect.
5. Splenic hypodensity is not well characterized and ultrasound
may be
obtained for evaluation if clinically indicated.
6. Moderate emphysema.

[**2131-12-23**] CXR: Bibasal effusions with a pneumonic consolidation
in the left lower lobe. Please ensure followup to clearance.

[**2131-12-23**] CT HEAD:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Left frontal encephalomalacia with probable slight further
involution.
3. Left maxillary sinus disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical history of COPD,
Wegener's granulomatosis with resulting chronic kidney disease,
recent admission [**Date range (3) 2374**] for acute on chronic renal
failure, started on hemodialysis w/hospital stay c/b left lower
lobe Moraxella pneumonia admitted with recurrant moraxella
pneumonia and sepsis.

1)Moraxella pneumonia: Most likely explanation for respiratory
failure/hypotension in ED requiring intubation.  She was
successfully extubated on [**12-25**] and maintaining O2 sats on O2
via NC without e/o respiratory distress.  Her sputum culture
from [**2131-12-24**] is again growing Moraxella, no other new
organisms.  CXR continues to show same LLL infiltrate concerning
for partially treated pneumonia.  Concerning for endobronchial
lesion with postobstructive pneumonia however chest CT did not
show any underlying structural cause for recurrance of
pneumonia.  She did have bilateral pleural effusions which
appeared simple and did not appear to be parapneumonic.  She was
initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn however this was
changed to ceftriaxone once culture data returned with
moraxella.  She improved daily from a repiratory standpoint and
was on minimal to no oxygen on discharge.  She was changed to
cefpodoxime on discharge to be given only on hemodialysis days,
after dialysis as this antibiotic is renally cleared.

2)Altered mental status: Likely delirium in the setting of
infection, sedating meds, ICU stay especially in setting of
advanced age.  In addition, daughter reports that she took
trazodone two days prior to admission, which has caused
confusion in the past.  She had a CT head on admission without
acute process.  Her mental status cleared during her hospital
stay and treatment of pneumonia.

3)Coagulopathy: Her INR was 2 on admission, however climbed to
peak of 5.3 likley due to poor nutrition and antibiotics.  Her
coumadin was stopped [**12-25**] and held throughout the remainder of
her admission.  She was restarted on 1mg coumdain on discharge
with INR checks with dialysis. Her INR was 2.9 on the day of
discharge.

4)Chronic renal failure: Secondary to ANCA vasculitis. Decision
made to initiate HD last admission.  She was dialysed for volume
overload in the hospital and was dishcarged with plan for
dialysis at FMC - West Suburban Dialysis Center.  She was
continued on epogen with dialysis, nephrocaps, calcitriol,
calcium.

5)Anemia: Baseline mid-20s as of most recent [**12-10**] admission;
prior to that was in the low 30s. No signs or symptoms of active
bl
