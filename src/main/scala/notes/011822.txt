Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 49M with COPD, OSA (on CPAP), poorly controlled
DM, who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with a CC of lethargy.  He is
here because his [**Name8 (MD) 269**] RN noted that he was lethargic and "nodding
in and out." As per the pt and his sister, he has had an ongoing
issue of lethargy and somnolence for the past 2 weeks. The pt's
sister notes low O2 levels, and the pt endorses SOB and cough
with production of white sputum. Of note, the pt also has a
recent h/o fall 2x in the last 2 weeks secondary to clumsiness
and numbness in the LEs. The pt states he has had HAs for the
past 2 months, and has also had some blurry vision. He also
endorses neuropathic pain in the B LEs. The pt currently
endorses [**2-26**] pain in the joints (hips, knees, and back). The pt
denies any dysuria.
.
He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2203-6-24**] for a CC of
leg swelling and blisters, SOB, and choking episodes when he
eats. On that admission, he was treated for COPD exacerbation
with steroids, antibiotics, and nebs. The patient's leg swelling
was attributed to venous stasis and his sedentary lifestyle. A
DVT was ruled out with LENI's, and a PE was r/o with a CTA.
.
In the ED, the patient's vitals were as follows: 98.9 100 155/76
13 95% on 35% O2 on bipap. A gas in the ED showed: 7.36/64/69.
Lactate was 3.1. He was continued on noninvasive ventilation,
and got duonebs. A cxr was done which showed no infiltrates. The
patient's last gas prior to transfer to the ICU was:
7.31/73/108. Lactate was then 2.1. The pt c/o joint pain.
Last vitals: 99.1 106 181/94 20 91
Access: 1x 18G
.
Upon transfer to the floor on [**2203-6-28**], pt has been diuresing
with lasix, and was negative 7L with 10mg IV lasix over 2 days.

Upon admission to the floor, pt is doing quite well.  No sob, no
cp, satting well on RA.  His sugars have been in the 200s-300s
in the MICU and was 129 on the floor.

...
CXR [**2203-6-26**]: Suboptimal radiograph due to patient body habitus.
Low lung
volumes. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis at the lung bases. There
is no focal lung consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. Hilar, mediastinal, and cardiac silhouette are
within normal limits. Mild
calcification at the aortic knob.
.
TTE [**2203-6-27**]:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral
and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function,
and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2202-9-14**], the findings are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the MICU on [**2203-6-26**] and transferred to the
floor on [**2203-6-28**].  He was sent home with services on [**2203-6-30**]

#) Respiratory Distress:  It was felt that his respiratory
distress was [**12-21**] to his obesity hypoventilation syndrome and
fluid overload. Given normal CXR and lack of fever of
leukocytosis, the MICU team felt that he was unlikely to have a
PNA. He was initially supported with O2 and BiPAP o/n (set at
20/16) to keep his sats in the upper 80s and lower 90s in the
MICU.  Additionally, he was diuresed with lasix 10mg IV x3
between the MICU and floor, and diuresed well over admission.
Once transferred to the floor, pt's daytime O2 requirement
decreased and he continued on BiPap at night.  By discharge he
was saturating in the mid-high 90s on room air. He was also
followed by sleep medicine and an outpatient sleep study was set
up for him.
.
#) Lethargy/Somnolence: likely a combination of hypercapnia from
COPD/OHS/OSA. and the regimen of narcotics and benzos the pt was
on.  His TSH was normal, and has not been
hypoglycemic/excessively hyperglycemic while here.   We
decreased his percocet from Q6H to Q8H in house, which patient
was not happy about and continued to have pain.  He did not have
any mental status changes after going to the floor.  We have
discharged him on his prior outpatient pain regimen (oxycontin
100mg TID, and percocet 5/325 prn q4h).  We feel that his pain
management is an issue that should be addressed at his PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 648**].
.
#) Diabetes Mellitus: Pt has difficult to control DM, on
metformin, glipizide, and levemir.  Pt had sugars upwards of
700s on the floor last admission.  His sugars were in the 200s
while in the MICU on this admission, and remained stable in the
high 100s-200s in the floor.  We restarted his home metformin at
1000mg [**Hospital1 **], and [**L
