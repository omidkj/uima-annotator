Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
None

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ, A-line, Intubation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted intubated from an OSH. The patient
required persistent ventilator support. His vent settings were
changed for ARDS treatment, specifically pressure control with
reduced tidal volumes (goal 450), reduced driving pressure (goal
14). The patient required high FiO2 (60%) to maintain his oxygen
pressure. He was continued on high dose steroids. The patient's
IV access from the outside hospital was removed and the patient
underwent right IJ line placement as well A-Line placement.
.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by a pneumothorax.
It is unknown if the pneumothorax was due to prior trauma (the
patient had a pneumothorax at the OSH prior to admission), a
complication from central line placement or volu/[**Doctor Last Name **] trauma
from mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent chest tube
placement with successful reduction of his pneumothorax. The
patient had a persistent air leak from the right sided chest
tube. The patient required large doses of sedation and continued
to have dyssynchrony from the vent. The patient failed a trial
of APRV. Ultimately the patient showed no improvements in his
respiratory status. Upon dicussion with the family it became
clear that the patient's wish was to never be ventilator
dependent for any protracted period of time (by the family's
account, the patient specifically stated a desire for no
mechanical ventilation beyond 2 days). In accordance with the
patient's stated wishes prior to intubation as well as the
family's wishes, the patient was extubated on [**2158-6-29**]. He
expired within 2 hours of extubation.
.
Of note, the patient had 1+ GNR on gram stain of his sputum and
out of concern for a possible ventilator-associate pneumonia he
was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Ultimately sputum
cultures grew only oropharyngeal flora. In addition, the patient
grew coag negative staph - a likely contaminent - in 1 out of 4
bottles of blood from his A-line.
