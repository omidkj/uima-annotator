Pertinent Results:
[**2117-12-27**] Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex, apical portions
of the inferior , septal and anterior walls. The mid portions of
the anterolateral, inferior septum and anterior septum are also
hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results on [**12-26**]/210 at 900am.
Post bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an
infusion of phenylephrine and milrinone. LVEF= 35%. RV function
