History of Present Illness:
This is an 81yo F PMHx ESRD not on HD (LUE fistula in place),
COPD, CHF (EF unknown), CAD on ASA and plavix, recent rehab
discharge who then presented to [**Hospital3 26615**] with lethargy,
coffee ground emesis and dark stools.  Per family report, 3wks
prior to admission, patient was admitted to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for
LUE fistula placement, and subsequently discharged to Country
Manor at [**Hospital 5028**] Rehab facility.  Pt was discharged from
rehab 1d prior to admission.  Since discharge, patient reported
feeling progressively "very weak".  On day of admission, she had
3-4 episodes of large coffee ground emesis, as well as multiple
tarry black stools.  As patient was becoming increasingly
lethargic, she her family called 911.
.
Per EMS report, patient was found hypotensive in the field to
60/40.  She was fluid resuscitated and stabilized with normal
saline, brought to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where her labs were significant
for WBC 5.8, Hct 17.9, plt 150, Cr 3.1. She was immediately
transfused with 2 units pRBCs, given a bolus of IV protonix, and
trasferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were 97.7 55 135/42 15 97%RA.
Patient was alert and oriented, comfortable, able to give
history.  Exam notable for nontender abdomen, rectal exam w
melena.  EKG demonstrated NSR at 53bpm w/o ST/Twave changes.
Labs were notable for Hct 26.3, plt 144, lactate 1.3, CXR with
prominent vascular markings, small L pleural effusion. NGL
demonstrated coffee grounds that did not clear w 500cc fluid.
Case discussed with GI, who recommended platelet transfusion
(not done given concern for fluid overload).  Patient was type
and crossed x2 units and admitted to MICU for further
management.  Vitals prior to transfer were 145/47 61 16 100%RA.
Access was 18g x2, 20g x1.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient comfortable, sleepy, without
complaint.  Vital signs were 97.8 60 128/34 16 98%RA.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2101-3-5**] 1:37 AM
IMPRESSION: Mild vascular congestion and small left pleural
effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
EGD. Saturday, [**2101-3-5**]
Old blood which was easily cleared without any evidence of
active or or former bleeding Fresh blood was seen in the
duodenal sweep which was cleared. A small area of active
bleeding was visualized, compatible with either a bleeding AVM
v. dieulafoy lesion (endoclip). Otherwise normal EGD to third
part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute GI bleed - En endoscopy performed by GI on [**2101-3-5**] which
showed a small area of active bleeding consistent with bleeding
AVM v. dieulafoy lesion. This was clipped. She was treated with
IV pantoprazole which was transitioned to oral upon discharge.

Plan going forward:
Continue ASA 325 as below
Hold Plavix as discussed with cardiologist and PCP
Continue pantoprazole

2. Acute blood loss anemia - Related to #1. Received a total of
3 units of pRBC and 1 bag of platelets. At the time of
discharge, hematocrit was 32.6

3. Acute renal failure - Cr was noted to be 3.1 on admission.
Unclear baseline. Likely due to volume depletion/anemia. Patient
Cr was trended while in MICU and improved to 2.1 before transfer
to floor in the setting of receiving blood. Upon discharge the
patient's Cr was 1.7.

4. CHF (unknown EF) / CAD / Hypertension - Patient's
cardiovascular status was monitored closely. She had one
troponin of 0.02 in the setting of a Cr of 3.1. Her CKMB was not
elevated. She had no chest pain or concerning EKG changes. The
likelihood of a significant coronary event were felt to be very
low. In the MICU the patient's lopressor, isosorbide
mononitrate, pravachol, niaspan, fenofibrate, ASA, plavix,
hydralazine, and isosorbide were initially held in setting of
large GI bleed. After she was stabilized from a hemodynamic
standpoint and could take oral medications she was restarted on
metoprolo
