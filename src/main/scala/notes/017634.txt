Brief Hospital Course:
41 y/o man with h/o alcoholic cirrhosis who presented after
being admitted to an outside hospital with SOB and fatigue.  Was
found to have a R pleural effusion and worsening of his LFTs. No
tap was performed [**3-7**] elevated INR.

He had a long hx of cirrhosis with worsening of his condition
over the past several months. He presented w/ encephalopathy and
severe jaundice with unclear cause of sudden decrease in liver
fxn.  Possible causes included infection, toxin, thrombosis of
veins.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. An US of the
liver w/ doppler revealed a cirrhotic liver without focal
lesions with nearly no flow within the main and left portal
veins, and no detectable flow within the right portal vein.
Massive varices within the abdomen with evidence of splenorenal
shunting. Massive splenomegaly. Small amount of perihepatic
ascites, which was not sufficient
to tap.  Nondistended gallbladder with gallbladder wall edema,
indicative of liver disease and right pleural effusion.

Labs were significant for + [**Last Name (un) 15412**] and IgG. He was followed by the
Hepatology service who initiated transplant workup. The
Transplant service was consulted on [**2137-10-27**] and a transplant
workup was completed. CT of the abdomen demonstrated a cirrhotic
liver with no mass lesion demonstrated. Patent but narrow
caliber portal vessels. Thin linear hypodensity within the main
portal vein likley  representing some nonocclusive thrombus.
Hepatic veins were patent. Features of portal hypertension
including splenomegaly, moderate amount of intra-abdominal
ascites and portosystemic collaterals were described.

He remained in the hospital for management of worsening liver
failure with hepatorenal syndrome. He became coagulopathic
requiring daily transfusions with platelets, FFP, cryo and PRBCs
per Hepatology recommendation to keep plt>20, inr<4, hct>25,
fibrin >150.  Encephalopathy wax and waned. This was managed
with lactulose and rifaximin. He was followed by social work,
psychiatry, nutrition and physical therapy. His MELD score
ranged in the 40s. He did not receive a liver transplant despite
being at the top of the list. He was transferrred to the SICU
with neurology consultation for worsening encephalopathy. He was
intubated.  A CT demonstrated a spontaneous subdural hematoma.
He was coagulopathic and due to his contraindication to
transplant, his family met with the team and decided to make him
CMO. He expired on [**2137-12-28**].
