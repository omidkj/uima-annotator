History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 F with a history of asthma, allergies, and
fibromyalgia who is admitted to the MICU for desensitization to
antibiotics for medical management of diverticulitis. Her
symptoms began a little over a week ago with "cramping"
abdominal pain "all over" the abdomen and several episodes of
loose stool (no blood). She had a general feeling of stomach
upset but no nausea/vomiting. Her husband had similar symptoms
initially so she assumed she had some sort of gastroenteritis.
However, his symptoms subsequently improved, while hers
intensified over the following days, until Sunday (two days
prior to admission) she had such pain after eating even a small
amount at her granddaughter's birthday party that she cried. On
Monday (yesterday), she went to see her PCP who referred her to
her gastroenterologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**], who has performed past
colonoscopies. She saw him at ~3:00 PM yesterday, and he ordered
bloodwork and CT abdomen, which revealed WBC elevated to 13 and
evidence of diverticulitis on CT. He called her this morning to
come into the ED. Because of her allergies to multiple
antibiotics, she was admitted to the medical ICU for
desensitization. Yesterday she was told to try BRAT diet, so she
ate two pieces of toast and some baby bananas yesterday, and a
part of a piece of toast today, but otherwise no PO intake.
.
Of note, she did have a prior episode of diverticulitis 20+
years ago. She states that she cannot remember the exact
presentation to determine whether this is similar or not. More
recently, she has had abdominal pains related to her
fibromyalgia, but she does not think she has had other
diverticulitis flares.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were T 98.4, HR 83, BP 152/63, RR
18, 100% on RA. She received total of 8 mg IV morphine for pain
control (initially [**9-17**]). Pelvic US was done to better evaluate
ovarian cyst seen on CT with recommendation for further
assessment with MR as outpatient. She received 1L IVF in ED. ID
consult team was verbally contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding antibiotic choice,
but no formal consult was initiated. Vitals prior to transfer to
the MICU were T 97.6, BP 124/66, HR 88, RR 16, 95% on RA.
.
With regard to her allergic history, she has reacted to
virtually every antibiotic she has had in the past. She has
reported history of reaction to penicillin, bactrim, quinolones
(cipro and levo), cephalosporins (ceclor). Reactions have
typically included pruritis beginning on face associated with
swelling (not immediately, but within a few hours of dosing) of
face and lips. She has not experienced throat swelling or
anaphylaxis.
.

CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2103-2-19**] 4:04 PM
IMPRESSION: 1. Findings consistent with acute sigmoid
diverticulosis. Noting wall thickening throughout the area, if
not recently performed, colonoscopy should be considered in
follow-up. 2. Large cystic left ovarian lesion, which is not
fully characterized by non-contrast CT. Further characterization
with pelvic ultrasound is recommended. 3. Dilatation and wall
thickening of the distal esophagus, probably inflammatory. The
presence of contrast in the distal esophagus is suggestive
either of associated dysmotility or possibly reflux. 4. Status
post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The presence of contrast
within the excluded portion of the stomach suggests a leak
across the staple line.

PELVIS LIMITED Study Date of [**2103-2-20**] 3:41 PM
PELVIS U.S., TRANSVAGINAL Study Date of [**2103-2-20**] 3:41 PM
IMPRESSION: An 8.8 x 9.4 x 6.4 cm left adnexal simple cyst,
further assessment with MR is recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
61 F with a history of multiple medication allergies and one
prior episode of diverticulitis who presents with abdominal pain
and CT evidence of non-complicated diverticulitis. Admitted to
medical ICU for desensitization to Augmentin for treatment.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#. Diverticulitis. Noted on CT scan as above. Has known history
of diverticulosis with one prior episode of diverticulitis
decades ago, conservatively managed. Patient appeared clinically
well, non-acute abdomen, tolerating pain. She was managed with
IVF, pain control (of note, felt flushed in response to
morphine; was offered dialudid as does not cause histamine
release, but declined). She was kept NPO overnight to minimize
risk of aspiration in the event that intubation was required
during desensitization protocol. She was transitioned to clears
and then BRAT diet on hospital day #2. She was desensit
