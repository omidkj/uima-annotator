ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2107-6-29**] 7:22 PM
IMPRESSION: Suggestion of pneumatosis in a massively fecally
loaded right colon with a dilated cecum at approximately 13.6 cm
as above. Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 51681**] the evaluation and if
indicated, CT scan recommended.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-6-30**] 5:24 PM
IMPRESSION: Increased lung markings are most likely secondary to
vascular crowding from low lung volumes, though interstital
edema cannot be excluded, especially in the setting of
cardiomegaly.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2107-6-30**] 3:57 PM
1. Unchanged appearance of massively fecal-loaded right colon
and dilated cecum.
2. The previously mentioned pneumatosis is not well visualized
on today's study. Continued follow up is recommended.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2107-7-1**]  10:12:08 AM
Sinus rhythm. Multifocal ventricular premature beats. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy. ST-T wave changes are probably related to left
ventricular
hypertrophy but cannot exclude ischemia. Compared to tracing #1
on [**2107-6-30**] the
ventricular premature beats are new and the ST segment elevation
and T wave
changes may be more significant in leads V2-V3. The ventricular
rate is slower.


Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2107-7-1**]
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% to 25% (nl >=55%)
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with severe
global
hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.

Adenocarcinoma.

SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: OMENTUM, ILEUM WITH APPENDIX, SUBTOTAL
COLECTOMY
[**2107-7-2**]
I. Omentum (A):
1. Fibroadipose tissue with focal hemorrhage.
2. No tumor.
II. Ileum, partial resection (B-H):
1. Segment of small intestine, with acute perforation.
2. Fibrous obliteration of appendix tip.
3. Two lymph nodes; no malignancy identified.
4. There is no tumor.
III. Ileocolectomy (I-V):
1. Adenocarcinoma of the distal colon, see synoptic report.
2. Dilation and congestion of the cecal area without hemorrhagic

infarction.
3. Ileal segment, within normal limits.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2107-7-11**] 6:36 PM
MODERATE ASCITES AND ANASARCA. RIM ANHANCING FLUID COLLECTION IS
NOTED AROUND THE ILEAL OSTEOMY. THIS AREA ALSO HAS GAS BUBBLES.
VERY CONCERNING FOR ABSCESS. THE SURGERY WAS 2WEEKS AGO,GAS IS
LESS LIKELY TO BE POSTSURGICAL. DW SURGICAL DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] RESIDENT
d/w radiology attending: unlikely that this is abscess

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. arrived in the ED for 35r time of month with stable VS as
described in HPI. Surgery was consulted and placed rectal tube,
NG tube, made NPO, began IVF and attemped cathartics and enemas
without success. The ileocecal valve was assesed as incompetent.
The patient was admitted to surgery. GI was consulted to perform
colonoscopy to evaluate for obstruction and to treat impaction.
Concurrently, the patient had evaluation by Echo and found to
have EF of 20-25%, and on EKG to have short runs of v-tach.
Cards was c/s regarding this and offered recommendations
throughout hospital stay. Colonoscopy on HD 2 revealed
obstructing mass at 25 cm in sigmoid and Bx was adenocarcimoma.
On HD 3 pt received subtotal colectomy, ileostomg and small
bowel resection to tx the obstruction. Post operatively pt did
well, fluid status and cardiac function was maximized with
medical tx, and patient will be sent home with close f/u to PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) 2086**], surgery and will receive home care for ostomy and
nursing issues. Other hospital course by systems is below:

GEN: Patient was pleasant and cooperative throughout hospital
stay.
PULM: the patient had good O2Sats throughout, remained on
Alb/ipratropium inhalers prn for asthma and pulm edema, though
never needed to use these. She was given o2 post operatively and
there were a few instanced where CXR was wet, 2nd to CHF,
resolving well with appropriate fluid balance.
CV: Pt had evaluation by cardiology for both CHF and EKG changes
with runs of V-tach. The primary team followed the following
recs: check [**Hospital1 **] lytes, aggressive repletion to maintain K=4,
Mg=2, restart lisinopril, titrate up as BP allows, decrease BB
prn for BP, HgbA1c, TSH, outpatient cards f/u ([**Hospital 1902**] clinic). She
will be sent home on new Rx regimen per cards, and have f/u with
[**Hospital 1902**] clinic.
ABD: Pt had surgery for obstruction intractable to medical
management as described above. Her ostomy post-op was high
output and required aggressive Rx management, but reduced over
hospital stay. She will receive outpt. ostomy f/u. CT abd
obtained 2nd to WBC, fluid collection below skin around ostomy,
no abscess and ostomy is clinically great. will f/u w/ [**Doctor First Name **]
clinic.
FEN: replaced lytes prn, will continue to follow on outpt basis.

Heme/ID. Pt remained afebrile throughout hospital course. WBC
was mildly elevated post op likely secondary to CHF and post-op.

Endo: pt had blood sugars mildly elevated post-op, will continue
to monitor w/ home nursing and f/u w/ PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4120**].
