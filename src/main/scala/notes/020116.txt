Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain w/syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-7-7**] Redo sternotomy with aortic valve replacement 27-mm
Biocor tissue heart valve

History of Present Illness:
65 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, critical AS, HTN, HLD presents to
the ED with syncope. The patient was walking up three flights of
stairs, felt dizzy, sat down and lost consciousness. The episode
was witnessed by his wife. She reports he was unconscious for
less than one minute. She reports he was "grey" but had a pulse.
She was concerned and started pressing on his chest. He awoke
with mild substernal chest pain. The patient has known critical
AS and is scheduled for elective AVR on Monday. The patient was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 3278**] in the beginning of [**Month (only) 116**] after a
similar episode. At that time, he had a TTE which diagnosed
aortic stenosis, and a cardiac catheterization which showed left
main 95%, LAD 100%, distal LCX 65%, ostial 70% OM3, RCA 100%
ostial, SVG-diag 100%, SVG- Lcx not documented, SVG-acute
marginal 90% discrete lesion, and SVG-RCA 60%, patent LIMA to
LAD
.
In the ED, the patient's EKG showed ST elevations in III and
aVF, depressions in I and aVL, TWI in V4-V6 consistent with
prior and new atrial fibrillation. The patient's labs were
significant for elevation of cardiac enzymes of troponin to
0.18, but no elevation of CK or MB. The patient was started on
heparin with a bolus. The patient also received a full strength
ASA .
Currently, he is asymptomatic.

[**2127-7-7**] Echo: Prebypass: Very poor image quality. Limited
imaging. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately

moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results on [**2127-7-7**] at 1230pm.
Post bypass: Patient is AV paced and receiving a infusion of
phenylephrine, epinephrine and milrinone. LVEF = 20%. Severe
hypokinesia of the anterior, anterospetal and septal walls. RV
function mildly depressed. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the
aortic position. Valve appears well seated and the leaflets move
well. Peak gradient across the aortic valve is 19 mm Hg. Poor
visualization of the aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 25597**] was admitted following
syncopal event with chest pain. Most recent echo showed severe
aortic stenosis and was already scheduled for elective valve
replacement on [**7-7**]. In ED there was new onset atrial
fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, rate controlled on
beta blockers. Heparin initiated prior to surgery. He was
appropriately medically managed and underwent pre-op work-up and
on [**7-7**] he was taken to the operating room where he underwent a
redo-sternotomy, aortic valve replacement. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. He required multiple inotropes and pressors
post-operatively and remained intubated until post-op day three.
In addition, patient was in complete heart block (initially
asystolic), continued to be V-paced post-op and was assessed for
permanent pacemaker by EP. Pacemaker was cancelled since
patient's rhythm converted to atrial fibrillation on post-op day
four. Eventually all inotropes and pressors were weaned and he
was suitable for transfer to telemetry floor on post-op day
seven. Coumadin and Heparin was started for his atrial
fibrillation. All tubes lines and drains were removed per
cardiac surgery protocol.
Once on the stepdown floor the patient worked with physical
