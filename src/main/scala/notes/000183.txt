Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  45%  >= 55%
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity:  1.0 m/sec  <= 2.0 m/sec
Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. Moderate
global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. RV
systolic function: mild to moderate global free wall
hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. The aortic
valve was not opening in the prebypass period in the setting of
tandem heart.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results before
cardiopulmonary byoass. The venous cannula for the tandem heart
seen at the IVC RA junction.
Impression: In the prebypass period, a large VSD (2cm x 1 cm)
seen in the basal to mid inferoseptal wall. The tandem heart is
functioning well as shown by the lack of aortic valve opening
with 4.2L/min flows.
Post bypass:
Patient is on 0.2 mcg/kg/min or milrinone.
LVEF is 45%. RV is mild global hypokinesis. Loading conditions
alters the dysfunction.
Normal three aortic cusps, no aortic stenosis with peak velocity
at 1m/sec. No AI. A 0.3cm x 1mm free floating homeogenous
structure was seen in the LVOT, (ventricular side of the aortic
valve, ? Ruptured chordae).
The VSD patch is seen on the LV side with no identifiable leaks.
The discontinuity between the inferior septum is still seen on
the RV side consistent with the surgical repair.
The mitral valve leaflets are normal, no papillary muscle
dysfunction or rutpure. Mild central MR>
The tricuspid leaflets are normal, with mild TR.
Minimal PI.
Intact thoracic aorta.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Final Report
Multifocal consolidations within the lungs, with only right apex
spearing
appears to be unchanged. The ET tube tip, left subclavian line,
feeding tube are unchanged. The right midline is unchanged.
Overall, no substantial change since the prior examination
obtained a day ago is demonstrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 732**] was transferred from an outside hospital presenting
with a myocardial infarction secondary to a large ventricular
septal defect.  A Tandem heart was placed on arrival. Closure of
the lesion was unsucessfully attempted with a ventricular septal
defect closure device as the lesion was larger than the device.
An oxygenator was added to the tandem device in the setting of
worsening oxygenation. During transition to oxygenation the
patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to 10-40mmHg. The
cardiology team tried to percutaneously close the VSD but was
unsuccesful.
On [**6-12**] she underwent open closure of her ventricular septal
defect.  Please see the operative note for details. In summary
she had:
1. Repair of postinfarct ventricular septal defect with a
pericardial onlay patch from the left ventricular side. Patch is
PeriGuard reference #[**Serial Number 88735**], lot #[**Telephone/Fax (5) 88736**].
2. Removal of patient from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
continuous circulatory support.
3. Open repair of right common femoral artery.
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in critical
but stable condition to the surgical intensive care unit on
multiple pressors and inotropes.
The patient was kept sedated to allow for diuresis in the
immediate p
