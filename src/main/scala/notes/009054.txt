History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12056**] is a 56 year old male who initially presented with
fevers and headaches. Outside evaluation was initially
unremarkable. His symptoms progressed and he began to experience
mental status changes.  He was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**].
Blood cultures grew out Group B Streptococcus and he was started
on Ampicillin. Despite medical therapy, he proceeded to
experience increasing shortness of breath and display signs of
congestive heart failure. He underwent several transthoracic
echocardiograms which were unrevealing. TEE was not performed at
that time secondary to orthopnea. Due to worsening hypoxia, he
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further medical evaluation and
treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12056**] was admitted to the MICU and underwent further
evaluation which included a transesophogeal echocardiogram. This
was notable for a large vegetation on the aortic valve
(non-coroanry cusp measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm). There was moderate
to severe ([**4-4**]+) aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
were structurally normal, mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral
regurgitation was seen. Overall left ventricular systolic
function was normal. Based on the above findings, cardiac
surgery was consulted and further evaluation was performed. He
was seen by the dental and infectious disease services prior to
surgical intervention. There was no evidence to acute dental
infection but extraction was recommended on tooth #18 to prevent
potential risk for bacteremia following his aortic valve
replacement. His preoperative course was otherwise unremarkable.

On [**8-6**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic valve replacement
utilizing a [**Street Address(2) 65560**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical heart valve. There
were no surgical complications and the patient was transferred
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, patient
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
difficulty. He maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day one. Warfarin anticoagulation was
initiated and dosed for a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0. A PICC
line was placed on postoperative day two for long term
antibiotics. In addition to intravenous Penicillin, he was
started on Cefepime for increasing cough and yellowish sputum
production. Chest x-ray at that time was concerning for an
increase in the atelectasis/consolidation in the left lower lobe
and continued opacity in the retrocardiac area. Subsequent chest
CT scan was remarkable for only improving pulmonary edema and
bilateral pleural effusions. He completed a 10 day course of
Cefepime and will remain on Penicillin for 6 weeks from the date
of surgery. His hospital course was also significant for a
[**Last Name (un) **] consult to assist in the managment of his diabetes
mellitus. Just prior to discharge, he underwent extraction of
tooth #18. The rest of his hospital course was uneventful and he
was cleared for discharge on postoperative day eight.
