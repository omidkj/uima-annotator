Imaging: CXR: cath tip in RV; hypoinflation; poor film quality;
right hilar fullness ?infiltrate, no effusions
_________________________________________
Echo [**2154-9-18**]
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
The rhythm
appears to be atrial fibrillation. Based on [**2146**] AHA
endocarditis prophylaxis
recommendations, the echo findings indicate a moderate risk
(prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and excellent systolic
function
(LVEF>70%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
excellent global
and normal regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Based on [**2146**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical
and
echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year old lady w/ vague history of CHF, h/o GI bleed, htn,
here w/ likely pneumonia, sepsis.
.
1. sepsis: upon admission, wbc 20, lactate elevated, likely
source was pneumonia, given aspiration event at dinner time and
RML infiltrate on xray in addition to h/o impressive hiatal
hernia.  Patient was started on a sepsis protocol in the ED and
was continued for the first day of ICU stay.  During day 2 BP's
have been stable and tachycardia improved.  She maintained NSR
with HRs between 100-120.  We maintained the patient on Levo and
Flagyl.  UA was negative, blood cx were still pending upon
discharge.
.
3. dyspnea/wheezing/chf: patient is reported as having a vague
hx of CHF.  Patient's BP responded to boluses of NS, and the
patient was making good urine.  O2 sats remained good.  Echo
done in house showed EF of 70% with 1-2+ MR and mild pulm artery
systolic HTN.  unsure of EF. Watch sats in setting of fluid
boluses and DNR/DNI status. For now, sats stable. Has allergy to
metoprolol and is not on chf regiment (ie ace inhibitor, etc).
Initially it was thought that wheezing and dy
