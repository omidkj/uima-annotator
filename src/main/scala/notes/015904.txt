History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with a history of aspiration PNA, COPD, CHF, A fib on
coumadin, CAD s/p CABG, who presented to OSH on [**11-27**]
complaining of shortness of breath.
.
Per OSH records, the patients wife had diagnosed [**Name (NI) 30475**] recently.
The patient completed a 10 day course of tamiflu. 48 hours after
stopping tamiflu, he developed shortness of breath, along with
fevers, rigors, and green colored sputum.
.
He presented to the ED on [**11-27**] at noon, at which time he was
hypertensive with SBP in 200s. EKG notable for 1mm ST
depressions in lateral leads. The patient was given nitro paste,
and started on a nitro gtt. He received 1 dose of Ceftriaxone,
Azithro, and Levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia seen
on CXR. He was transferred to OSH ICU.
.
In the ICU the patient received 1L NS, 1u PRBCs, and Combivent.
Shortly after finishing the transfusion he got acutely short of
breath, requiring BiPap. The patient was hypertensive again,
requiring increased dose of nitro gtt. He got lasix 20mg IV x1,
40mg IV x1, but only put out 15cc of urine to this. He desatted
to the high 70s, and was intubated for hypoxemia.
.
After intubation he had transient desats to the 80s, likely
secondary to improper sedation. He was started on a propofol gtt
and a versed gtt. Thereafter he was hypotensive and tachycardic,
and started on a Dopamine gtt, and Levophed gtt. A R subclavian
was placed after a 2nd attempt. CVP was 15 at that time.
.
WBC 10.6, HCT was initially 27.3, Cr initially 1.1, went up to
1.7.
The patient received one dose of Vancomycin, Flagyl, and
Tamiflu. He also got 120mg IV solumedrol.
.
Most recent set of vitals at time of sign out was Afebrile, HR
99, Systolic BP 100, 95% on FiO2 80%, Tv 6cc/kg, RR 16.

Radiology

[**2102-11-28**] Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated right ventricle with severe RV systolic
dysfunction. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2102-12-19**] Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No definite vegetations seen.
.
[**2102-11-28**] EKG Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Incomplete right bundle-branch block. Inferior and
lateral ST segment depression. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
[**2102-12-15**] CT chest abdomen pelvis
. Abnormally located short segment of jejunum demonstrating a
prominent
bowel wall. This finding can be asociated with internal hernia.
However, no secondary signs of obstruction or adjacent
mesenteric stranding are
identified. Clinical correlation is recommended.
2. Multifocal airspace opacities, which are somewhat more
confluent in the
right upper lobe, in addition to small bilateral pleural
effusions, right
greater than left. These findings are most consistent with
pulmonary edema.  However, superinfection, particularly in the
right upper lobe cannot entirely be excluded.

EEG [**12-20**]
This is an abnormal routine EEG secondary to persistent
generalized triphasic waves. During brief portions of the study
where
triphasics are not present, the background was diffusely slow
and
disorganized suggesting a moderate to severe encephalopathy.
There were
no epileptiform features on this study.

Renal U/s [**12-22**]
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Relatively echogenic renal
parenchyma, may be due to medical renal disease.
