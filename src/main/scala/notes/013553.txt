Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization without intervention


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 68M h/o CAD s/p CABG, DM2, CRI presented to OSH
[**2152-11-2**] with chest pain. Initially noted intermittent 'shooting'
pains in his chest on [**10-31**] that radiated throughout body. On
[**11-2**] at 10am, developed [**10-10**] substernal chest pressure while
defecating that radiated to the neck. Associated with
diaphoresis and nausea but no SOB. He took SL nitro x 3 without
improvement and called EMS.

At OSH, ECG revealed sub-mm ST elevations and TWIs in V5-[**Street Address(2) 69974**] depressions V1-V4. Cardiac enzymes were positive (CK 409, MB
17, MBI 4, TnT 2.4). Given aspirin 325mg, plavix 600mg load, IV
lopressor, and heparin gtt. He became pain free on nitro gtt and
morphine prn.  BNP 4300 with normal CXR. On [**11-3**] early AM, he
was found to be in AF with RVR 120's. No prior h/o AF or
palpitations per his report. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.

Received pre-cath hydration. Cath revealed totally occluded
native vessels, fresh thrombus in SVG->OM, and occluded stubs in
the SVG->diag and SVG->RCA; the SVG->PDA and LIMA->LAD were
patent. No intervention given >48hrs since event. Right heart
cath was not performed. While in holding area s/p cath, became
increasingly dyspnic. Noted to be in AF with HR 110's. Denies
palpitations. Also somnolent s/p fentanyl with observed apneic
episodes. Chest pain free.

On ROS, reports claudication for years. Currently can walk only
10 feet without pain, resolves with rest. No resting
claudication. Denies PND and ankle edema. Recent worsened
orthopnea (1->2 pillow). No abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, headache, fevers, or chills.

.
ECG ([**11-3**]): atrial fibrillation, 109 bpm, normal axis and
intervals, sub-mm STE and TWI V5-6, STD V1-V4
.
Relevant Imaging:
1)Cardiac cath ([**2152-11-3**]):  1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated LMCA without angiographically
significant disease. The LAD, LCX and RCA were all proximally
occluded, as previously known.
2. The LIMA to LAD graft was widely patent and the distal LAD
was
satisfactory. The SVG to PDA was patent. The SVG to R-PL and the
SVG to
OM were totally occluded stubs. The SVG to diagonal was freshly
occluded
with thrombus present. 3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
systemic arterial pressure of 98 mmHg systoic and 66 mmHg at
diastole.
4. Recommend medical therapy; SVG to diagonal not suitable for
PCI or
thrombolytics.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD and SVG to R-PDA. Occluded SVGs to OM,
diagonal
and R-PL.
.
2)ECHO([**11-3**]):1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated.  2. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed. Inferior and lateral hypokinesis to
akinesis is present.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. 4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 6. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 7. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion.
.
3)CXR ([**11-3**]):Mild cardiomegaly. Cannot exclude small pleural
effusion.
.
4)CXR ([**11-6**]): 1. Interval development of infiltrate in right
lower lobe worrisome for pneumonia. 2. Pulmonary vascular
engorgnent with bilateral pleural effusions in the setting of
cardiomegaly, likely representing CHF.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68M h/o CAD s/p CABG presents with STEMI, new-onset AF with
RVR, and dyspnea.
.
# CAD: The patient was taken to cardiac cath which revealed
fresh thrombus in SVG->OM graft and likely old totally occlusion
of SVG->RCA and SVG->diag grafts. The SVG->OM and LIMA->LAD
grafts were patent. No intervention was performed given that the
patient presented >48 hours from symptom onset and infarction
completed. TTE revealed new lateral wall hypokinesis and
diminished systolic function c/w recent infarct. He was given
aspirin, plavix, statin, beta-blocker; however plavix was
discontinued prior to discharge given no PCI. He will f/u with
his cardiologist.
.
# CHF: EF 35%. Initially volume overloaded but diuresed with
lasix and euvolemic at discharge; started on toprol XL and
lisinopril. 2gm Na diet.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: paroxysmal. AF with RVR at presentation,
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm and then back into AF.
Loaded with amiodarone (normal QTc, TFTs, and LFTs; he will need
outpatient PFTs) and cont on beta-blocker for rate control.
Heparin gtt started and bridged to coumadin with goal INR [**2-4**].
He was given [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitor at discharge.
.
# Chest/neck pain: Multiple episodes of sharp migratory stabbing
pains during admission. DDx included pericarditis,
musculoskeletal pain, or rate relate angina. atypical for
angina, no specific ECG changes, and cardiac enzymes cont to
trend down. He was given tylenol prn with good response.
.
# Anemia: Hct decreased likely due to blood loss during cath and
dilutional componenent from pre-cath fluids. Remained stable. No
groin hematoma/bleeding and RP bleed unlikely. Will need
outpatient Hct check by PCP.
.
# Dyspnea: likely [**2-3**] volume overload from pre-cath hydration
for IV contrast nephropathy prophylaxis. CXR revealed small left
effusion, RLL opacity. Low-grade fevers and mild elevation WBC;
started ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Discharged to complete
course of augmentin.
.
# Pericardial effusion: small
