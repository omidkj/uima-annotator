Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Beta-Blockers (Beta-Adrenergic Blocking Agts) / Terazosin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
88 M admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with CAP and atrial fibrillation
with RVR on [**2-16**]. He was treated with levaquin and then changed
to CTX/azithro/flagyl and subsequently transferred to ICU for
hypoxia thought to be due to acute heart failure. TTE showed
preserved systolic function but did show moderate RV dilation so
a CTA chest was done which was negative for PE. Remained hypoxic
and placed on BIPAP which fell on his head causing laceration,
has had 2 CTH which were unrevealing for ICH. Has been on
diltiazem gtt for rate control and VSS at time of transfer wre
90s on NRB and stable BP and HR.

Upon arrival to the ICU patient comfortable and in no acute
distress, speaking in full sentences with clear sensorium. No
complaints.

Patient then became difficult to mantain adequate oxygenation on
NRB and subsequently on BIPAP with saturations in the 90s,
patient became progressively delirious and intubation was
undertaken.

Labs on Discharge:

Micro:

Studies:
ECHO ([**2-20**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid- to
distal anterior and anteroseptal hypokinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Severe
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w LAD disease. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

CXR ([**2-21**]): Asymmetrically distributed pulmonary edema improved
substantially between [**2-19**] and [**2-20**] and heart size decreased.
Allowing for lower lung volumes, there has been no subsequent
change. Since 8:10 p.m. on [**2-20**] more confluent areas of
pulmonary abnormality in the axillary subsegments of the right
upper lobe and right lung base posteriorly, could be pneumonia
but could also be asymmetric edema and atelectasis, particularly
the latter. There is no appreciable pleural effusion. ET tube is
in standard placement. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. No
pneumothorax.

CXR ([**2-23**]):  In comparison with the study of [**2-22**], there is
continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure with
atelectasis at the left base medially.

Video swallow study ([**2-24**]): ****

Brief Hospital Course:
88 year old male with CAD s/p CABG, remote smoking history,
atrial fibrillation, [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with
hypoxia after being treated for a CAP
.
# Hypoxia: Initially intubated given difficulty with
oxygenation. TTE revealed regional akinesis and hypokinesis, as
well as LVEF 35%, possibly attributable to acute heart failure.
He was placed on furosemide gtt but was intermittently held for
hypotension. Was placed on empiric antibiotics for CAP. Was
evaluated by Speech & Swallow therapy, and was believed to be
aspirating as well has collecting significant pharyngeal
residue, to which he was insensate. This was potentially
secondary to irritation of his oropharynx from his brief
intubation. His hypoxia improved greatly, and it was felt that
his swallow would likely recover over time.  A dobhoff was
placed for temporary nutrition and med administration.  ****
.
# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: Placed on diltiazem gtt for rate
control. Amiodarone was initially held for concern for
amiodarone-induced pneumonitis, but this was eventually
restarted. Warfarin was restarted on [**2-21**]. Dilt was switched
over to PO and increased to 60qd with good rate control.  At
dishcarge his home dose of verapamil SR was restarted.
.
# CAD s/p CABG/CHF:  Added lisinopril to home regimen.****
.
# HTN: Well controlled on home regimen.

Discharge Instructions:

You were transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for better managment of your
low oxgyen levels which had required intubation at the outside
hospital.  It was determined that you had a complicated
pneumonia, which responded well to antibiotics.  It was
determined that you need tube feeds to temporarily protect your
wind pipe while your swallowing is not strong.

The following changes were made to your outpatient regimen:
Your warfarin was changed to 2mg per day.

Followup Instructions:
As needed with Rehab Facility MD
