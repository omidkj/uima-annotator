Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old
gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease, status
post myocardial infarction was transferred to the [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2193-12-15**] after
awakening early in the morning with shortness of breath,
chest congestion, shakiness, and nausea.  The medics were
called at that time by the patient's wife who brought him to
[**Name (NI) 1474**] Hospital.  He was treated there with IV Lasix and
sublingual nitroglycerin as well as beta blockers and aspirin
and placed on a heparin drip, a nitroglycerin drip, and he
was transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
further treatment.

Upon admission, the patient was afebrile.  He was in sinus
rhythm of 70s, blood pressure 180/60, and his 5 liter nasal
cannula oxygen saturation was 94-95%.  On his physical
examination, he did have jugular venous distention.  He also
had bibasilar crackles about half way up both lung fields.
His physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction in [**2191**].
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral
carotid endarterectomies in [**2188**].

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Zyprexa 5 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Isosorbide 30 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Allopurinol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Aricept 10 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was noted to have some memory
and cognition difficulties upon admission to the hospital and
unable to consent to procedures.

He underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2193-12-16**] and
this revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%,
left main coronary artery stenosis of 70-80%, as well as
three vessel coronary artery disease.

A Neurology consultation was also obtained on [**2193-12-16**] due to the patient's mental status.  It was the
Neurology Service recommendation to get an MRI as well as to
check some laboratory values.  Cardiac Surgery consultation
was obtained also on [**2193-12-16**] and it was felt that to
sort out the patient's mental status and neurologic status
prior to proceeding with coronary artery bypass surgery.

On [**2193-12-17**], the patient underwent carotid ultrasound
studies which showed no significant plaque in the right
internal carotid artery, however, the left was not visualized
and felt to be occluded.  He was noted to have patent
vertebral arteries, the right being with less blood flow than
the left.

Over the next couple of days, the patient did clear from a
mental status standpoint, however, was noted to have some ST
changes by EKG.  This was treated medically.  On [**2193-12-18**], the patient was seen by the Neurosurgery Service due to
his neurovasculature.  It was their recommendation to
schedule the patient for angiography the following day to
evaluate his carotid artery and cerebral blood flow.  On
[**2193-12-19**], the patient was also seen by the
Rheumatology Service due to a new complaint of right knee
pain.  The patient did have an aspiration of the knee joint
at that time and it was the rheumatologist's assessment that
this could be gout in his knee.

Cerebral angiography on [**2193-12-19**] revealed an occluded
left internal carotid of 70% stenosis bilaterally of the
vertebral arteries at that time.

The patient continued to be followed on the Medical Service.
He was placed on Plavix due to his cerebrovascular disease.
On [**2193-12-23**], the patient was taken to the
Neuroradiology Department to have stents placed in both the
right and left vertebral arteries.  This was done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 1132**].  The patient remained stable postprocedure and was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for neurological
checks and close monitoring.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
recovering from his vertebral artery stents awaiting coronary
artery bypass grafting.

On [**2193-12-27**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] who performed an off-pump coronary
artery bypass graft times three with a LIMA to the diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to the OM and saphenous vein graft to
the RPL.

Postoperatively, the patient was on nitroglycerin,
Neo-Synephrine, and Propofol drips.  He was transported from
the Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in
good condition.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was weaned from
mechanical ventilation and extubated and doing well.
However, despite receiving blood transfusion had remained
with low mixed venous oxygen saturations.  He was ultimately
started on milrinone IV drip for low cardiac output and low
mixed venous oxygen saturations.  He remained stable on
milrinone and Neo-Synephrine drips over the next few days in
the Intensive Care Unit.  He was placed on levofloxacin due
to copious pulmonary secretions.  He continued to be
transfused to maintain a hematocrit above 30% due to low
C02s.

On postoperative day number three, the patient underwent
video swallow evaluation due to questionable aspiration risk
and it was found that he was an aspiration risk with thin
liquids but able to tolerate thick liquids and solid foods
without a problem.  The patient had multiple episodes of
postoperative atrial fibrillation.

On postoperative day number four, the Electrophysiology
Service was consulted with the recommendation to continue the
Amiodarone that he had been on and perhaps to add digoxin as
well.  The Heart Failure Service was also consulted at that
time due to continued need for milrinone and low cardiac
output.  It was their recommendation to discontinue diuresis
as the patient was intravascularly dry and to give low-dose
daily digoxin.

The patient continued to progress slowly in the Intensive
Care Unit on milrinone, Amiodarone, and heparin drips.  On
postoperative day number six, the patient did receive some
fluid, had some more continued atrial fibrillation, and
ultimately converted out of that, being started on Lopressor
and weaning his milrinone down.  The patient continued to
stay in the Intensive Care Unit.  As oral Captopril was
initiated, milrinone was discontinued on postoperative day
number seven.  The patient's Swan-Ganz catheter was also
removed at that time and clinically the patient continued to
progress appropriately.  He remained hemodynamically stable
over the next few days and was ultimately transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor on [**2194-1-6**], postoperative day number ten.

He has progressed very slowly from a physical therapy
standpoint and it is the recommendation that the patient be
transferred from the acute care setting to a rehabilitation
facility to work on increasing mobility and endurance.  The
patient has remained hemodynamically stable, had some
troubles with hypertension and his Captopril has been
increased over the past few days.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable.  He has had no
further episodes of atrial fibrillation for the past few days
and ready to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility.
The patient's condition today, [**2194-1-10**], is as
follows:  Temperature 97.6, pulse 64, normal sinus rhythm,
respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 134/45, although he had
been as high as the 160s or 170s earlier this morning.  His
weight today is 67.6 kilograms.  Neurologically, the patient
is awake, alert, and oriented, moving all extremities well
but does have a significantly flat affect.  Pulmonary
examination revealed that the lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Coronary examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm with no murmur noted.  His abdomen
was benign.  His extremities were warm and well perfuse
without peripheral edema.  His sternal incision was clean,
dry, and intact.
