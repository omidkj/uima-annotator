Date of Birth:  [**2061-9-19**]        Sex:  F

Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
female, admitted to the cardiology service after a recent
accident and presented with signs and symptoms of [**Last Name (un) **]-Tsubo
cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction related to this.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypercholesterolemia,
diabetes mellitus, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
hypertension and iron deficiency anemia.

ALLERGIES:  She denied any known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Toprol
2.  Lipitor
3.  Univasc
4.  Warfarin
5.  Flecainide
6.  Metformin
7.  Glyburide

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She appeared comfortable in no
apparent distress. There were bilateral rales on chest
examination with a 9 cm jugular venous distension. The heart
was of a regular rate and rhythm. The abdomen was soft and
nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for an EKG showing atrial
fibrillation at 93 beats per minute and early repolarization
in V1 to V3 with T wave inversions in V3 through V6 and 1, 2
and F.

Her hemoglobin level was 11.6 and white count 13.7. The INR
was 2.7.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 68-year-old female, admitted to the
cardiology service with [**Last Name (un) **]-Tsubo cardiomyopathy and
myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She underwent cardiac catheterization. She
was noted to have a depressed ejection fraction. On [**2130-7-22**], she was noted to develop diffuse then focal right lower
quadrant tenderness with nausea. Workup revealed leukocytosis
and a CT scan of the abdomen revealed mesenteric vessel air
near the cecum. Repeat CT scan on [**2130-7-23**], revealed
pneumatosis of the cecum and proximal right colon. She was
also in atrial fibrillation and flutter, which had been
treated with amiodarone and heparin drip.

The patient was seen in consultation by general surgery and
was felt to have right colon and cecal ischemia, possibly a
necrosis, and was taken urgently for exploratory laparotomy.
There were findings of ischemic cecum and scattered areas of
ischemia throughout the transverse colon. She underwent
ileocecectomy with stapling of the ends as she was
hemodynamically unstable with an arrhythmia in the operating
room. Therefore, the abdomen was left open and closed with a
[**Location (un) 5701**] bag and she was taken to the intensive care unit for
further stabilization.

She was stabilized and then brought back to the operating
room on [**2130-7-24**], where the remainder of the colon at
this time appeared pristine and we were able to perform an
ileocolostomy. Please see the operative note for further
details of these procedures.

Postoperatively, she recovered well. She was eventually
weaned and extubated. She remained on anticoagulation for the
atrial fibrillation and flutter, as well as the amiodarone
and Lopressor. She continued to do well. She was diuresed.
She was begun on her diet and advanced well with that. She
was noted to be C-diff positive and was treated with Flagyl
for this. She was well enough on [**2130-8-3**], to be
discharged to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  [**Last Name (un) **]-Tsabu syndrome with myocardial infarction and
    cardiomyopathy.
2.  Ischemic colon requiring ileocolectomy.
3.  Atrial fibrillation and flutter.
4.  C-difficile diarrhea.
5.  Comorbidities of diabetes mellitus, paroxysmal atrial
    fibrillation, high blood pressure.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was asked to followup
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 week. She was also to followup with her
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week. She was to followup with
cardiology, who would monitor her heparin and Coumadin. She
was to continue taking Flagyl for the C-difficile colitis.
She was to supplement her diet with Boost or Ensure
supplement as she advanced further on her diet.
