Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm Magna Ease aortic
valve bioprosthesis, serial number [**Serial Number 87569**], model number 3300TFX
on [**2179-9-23**].
EGD
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
53 y/o M with history of hypertension, NIDDM, Hepatitis C, IVDU
presenting from [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with coag negative staph
aortic valve endocarditis.  Patient presented to his PCP's
office in [**Month (only) 216**] and PCP noted [**Name Initial (PRE) **] new AI murmur.  A TTE showed
moderate AI without vegetation and a question bicuspid aortic
valve.  Patient went back to his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**9-10**] c/o 25 pound weight
loss over several weeks, decreased appetite, fever/chills, night
sweats, and increasing fatigue.  These symptoms have been
present since spring/early summer; hwoever, have acutely
worsened over the past month.  Blood cultures were sent as an
outpatient, which grew coag negative staph in [**3-3**] bottles,
resistant to oxacillin and PCN.  He was subsequently admitted to
[**Hospital3 417**] on Monday [**9-13**], and upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**],
cultures were growing gram + cocci in clusters with
sensitivities pending; he is MRSA + in the nares.  He was
started on Vancomycin on [**9-13**].  TEE was done today at OSH
showing a large aortic vegetation with collapse of valve leaflet
into the LV, severe AR, mild LV dilation and a normal EF.
Patient was transferred here for further cardiac surgical
evaluation and management.


Past Medical History:
- Hepatitis C
- Left facial periorbital cellulitis [**4-/2179**], treated with

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal IVC
diameter (<2.1cm) with >55% decrease during respiration
(estimated RA pressure (0-5mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Probable aortic valve vegetation. No AS. Increased transaortic
velocity related to increased stroke volume due to AR. Severe
(4+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There
