Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
elective core-valve

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CoreValve implantation for replacement of stenotic aortic valve


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 90392**] is an 87 year old female with PMH severe AS and Hx
of afib, CHF EF 65%, pacemaker (SSS), moderate LVH, who is
admitted electively for CoreValve placement [**5-17**].
She recently was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) 958**] from [**Hospital 35462**] for evaluation of AVR vs valvuloplasty. She initially
presented to [**Hospital3 **] [**3-25**] with worsening dyspnea and
cough x 1 week. She was found to be in AF/RVR and acute CHF.
Diuresed and started on metoprolol for rate control which
improved her SOB. Her cough was thought secondary to CHF and she
was started on Tessilon perles for control. She also developed
[**Last Name (un) **] with diuresis and diuretics were held at discharge with f/u
labs.
Workup for AVR found no significant CAD, [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8, AV gradient
of 41mmHg across the valve which persisted with dobutamine
challenge. Her aorta was noted to be severely calcified
excluding her from open surgical repair of the aortic valve.
Valvuloplasty as deferred. She was discharged home with a plan
to discuss aortic valve replacement
with her cardiologist. Over the next few months she and her
family opted for percutaneous AV replacement. Her cough improved
with continued diuresis.
.
She currently complains of minimal shortness of breath at rest
and is able to ambulate around home slowly with mod to severe
DOE after ambulating [**10-27**] steps. She is limited to only
occasional trips outside of home and needs help wtih ADL's [**2-10**]
dementia. She is NYHA Class II-III. Sleeps with one pillow. Her
metoprolol was d/c'ed because of hypotension by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**] but
Losartan was continued per family. She is quite forgetful and
needs frequent cues and reminders of current events.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. She has bilat knee pain
attributed to OA. She was recently transitioned to Pradaxa
instead of coumadin to avoid blood draws. Her insurance does not
cover this and family is considering switching back. Pt went to
urologist as an [**Last Name (STitle) 3782**] for evaluation of renal mass who
recommended no furhter tests at this time, she will return in
about one month.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
.
.
Echocardiography [**5-17**]
Pre-TAVI:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results.

Post-TAVI:
The patient is on a phenylephrine infusion.
An aortic valve implant is seen, there is trave aortic
insufficiency.
The mitral regurgitation is unchanged.
.
.
Pre-discharge: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position. An
aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient
is normal for this prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
