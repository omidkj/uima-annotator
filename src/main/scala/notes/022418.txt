REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 40% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: *4.5 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 1.0 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. All
four pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Dynamic
interatrial septum.
Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. Small
secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderately
depressed LVEF.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid
anteroseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal - hypo; septal apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta.
Mildly dilated aortic arch. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Moderately dilated
descending aorta Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Mild (1+) AR.


MITRAL VALVE: No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. A left-to-right shunt across
the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is
present.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed.
With LVEF of 40%
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The
ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are
simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
moderately
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
Ascending aortic contour is suggestive of well placed graft .
Normal RV systolic function.
Overall LVEF 40%.
Mild AI, MR.
[**Name13 (STitle) **] PHYSICIAN:









Brief Hospital Course:
The patient went from the ED directly to the cath lab and the 2
grafts(LIMA->LAD, RIMA->RCA) were patent.  He had a thoracic
aneurysm without evidence of dissection and mild pulm. HTN.  He
continued having chest pain and had a CTA of chest which showed
a slight increase in size of aneurysm to 5.1 cm with a
dissection of the ascending aorta.  Cardiac surgery was
consulted and a TEE was performed which revealed no clear Type A
dissection but possible focal ulceration and moderate AI.

On [**12-25**] he underwent Redo sternotomy/Replacement of the
ascending and hemi arch aorta(28 mm Gelweave graft) by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. The cross clamp time was 63 mins., total bypass time
was 98 mins., and circ. arrest time was 13 mins.  He was
transferred to the CSRU on stable condition on Epi, Neo, and
Propofol in stable condition. He was extubated on POD#1 and was
transferred to the floor.  His chest tubes were removed and
later that night he developed severe subcutaneous emphysema.  He
was transferred back to the CSRU and had a right chest tube
placed.  This was not effective and was d/c'd.  The following
morning he had 14 gauge angiocaths placed in the ant. chest
bilaterally and this helped with the subcutaneous air.  He
continued to progress and was transferred back to the floor on
POD#4.  He continued to progress and was discharged to home on
POD# 5.
