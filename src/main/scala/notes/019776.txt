Studies:
[**2143-1-12**] AP CXR - IMPRESSION: Unchanged cardiomegaly.
Progressive airspace opacities right greater than left, which
may reflect atelectasis or infection. The patient will be
undergoing CT for further evaluation.
.
CT Head [**2143-1-14**]:
1. Multiple areas of hypodensity as described above compatible
with prior
infarcts. If there is continued clinical concern for acute
infarction, an MRI should be obtained.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2143-1-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology.
2. Enlarged main pulmonary artery. Please correlate clinically
for pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Cardiomegaly, small pericardial effusion.
4. Small hiatal hernia.
5. 1.4 cm right adrenal nodule, stable since [**2142-10-25**] though
of
indeterminate etiology. Consider MRI to further characterize.
.
[**2143-1-17**] AP CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous
radiograph, the transparency of the lung parenchyma at the right
lung base has increased, suggesting improved ventilation.
Unchanged is the moderate retrocardiac opacity and the moderate
cardiomegaly. No evidence of interval occurrence of new
parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.

.
[**2143-1-25**] RUQ US:
1. Unremarkable right upper quadrant ultrasound.
2. No cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
.
[**1-27**] CXR:
There is unchanged cardiomegaly. There is a tracheostomy with
the distal lead tip at the level of the clavicles. There is a
left retrocardiac opacity and left-sided pleural effusion. There
is also pulmonary edema, which has worsened since the previous
study.
.
[**1-28**] KUB:
GJ tube appears in the appropriate position.
.
[**1-30**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison to the study of [**1-27**], there is little
overall change.  Opacification at the left base behind the heart
persists with blunting of the costophrenic angle. Again, this is
consistent with atelectasis or consolidation with associated
pleural effusion.
The degree of pulmonary vascular prominence is less on the
previous study. Tracheostomy tube remains in place.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81709**] is a 50 year old male with PMHx significant for
atrial fibrillation, CAD, HTN, CHF, DM, obesity, and recent
pontine and cerebellar infarcts recently discharged after a
prolonged hospitalization complicated by fevers who presented
with fevers and tachycardia and was initially admitted to the
MICU.

# Fevers - The patient had almost daily fevers (typically in the
early evening) that were felt to likely have a central component
to them.  Initially, he was started on vancomycin and cefepime,
which were stopped after cultures were negative.  He was also
started on Flagyl, which was stopped after he was negative for
C.diff.  CT torso did not reveal any acute pathology.  Of note,
the patient was noted to have stenotrophomonas in his sputum
during his previous hospitalization.  He was treated with a
14-day course of bactrim, which ended on [**1-16**].  The patient
continued to have episodes of fevers (typically 101-103) with
temperatures that returned to 98-99 in between fevers with
negative cultures.  He was treated with cooling blankets and
around the clock tylenol.  He occassionally required IV fluid
boluses for dehydration/hypotension.

# Atrial Fibrillation - He was also noted to be in atrial
fibrillation with RVR on presentation and was admitted to the
MICU.  While in the MICU, his metoprolol was decreased to 12.5
mg TID secondary to hypotension.  On the floor, however, h
