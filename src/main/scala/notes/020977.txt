Brief Hospital Course:
# Fall from Wheelchair
Imaging:
CT-C-spine ([**2122-9-10**])
REASON FOR EXAM: Status post trauma.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial CT images of the cervical spine
as well as
coronal and sagittal reformatted images were submitted for
interpretation.

FINDINGS: There is a 0.6-cm inferiorly displaced fracture of the

anteroinferior portion of the C6 vertebral body without
dislocation or
subluxation. Fracture involves the anterior column and anterior
middle column
of the verterbal body. Mild diffuse vertebral body height loss
is likely
degenerative in nature. Diffuse narrowing of the cervical spinal
canal, as
well as severe degenerative changes with posterior osteophyte
formation,
places the patient at high risk of cord injury. Normal alignment
of the
cervical spine is maintained. There is mild swelling of the
prevertebral soft
tissues. Stylohyoid ligament calcification and areas of
fragmentation, more on
the right than left, likely chroni
