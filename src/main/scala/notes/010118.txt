Allergies:
Penicillins / Levofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 89 yo female smoker w/ pmhx of COPD with last FEV1 1.1
in [**2120**], CAD, CHF with EF 55%, PVD, HTN who is being transferred
from MICU after becoming hypoxic while on the floor. The patient
was originally admitted on [**2123-11-27**] for COPD flare-like PNA and
treated with nebs, prednisone, and azithromycin. She became
acutely hypoxic w/ sats down to 80's, resolved with NRB, and
complained of chest pain as well. The patient was ruled out for
an MI by EKG and cardiac enzymes, pain resolved w/ nitro. The
patient did not require intubation, was managed on BIPAP and
weaned down to nasal cannula. The patient does not use O2 at
home. The patient was also treated w/ IV steroids and
ceftriaxone for infiltrate on L base seen on repeat CXR. The
patient then developed a-fib with RVR, was rate controlled with
diltiazem and started on coumadin for anticoagulation. The
patient currently denies any shortness of breath or dyspnea, no
chest pain, no cough (per pt). The patient denies
lightheadedness or  palpitations. She has been feeling nauseous,
with only one small bowel movement since admission. The patient
denies any weakness, numbness, or vision changes.  Denies a
history of illness or weight loss prior to admission.  Typically
uses her nebulizers at home every four hours.

general: pleasant, comfortable, elderly, NAD, "I want to leave".
Able to speak full sentenses.

without lesions, dry/prominently red tongue, no supraclavicular
or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no carotid bruits
lungs: CTA b/l with poor air movement throughout
heart: RR, S1 and S2 wnl, [**1-10**] hsm at rusb (documented in prior
exams)
abdomen: non-distended, soft, +b/s, nt, no masses
extremities: no cyanosis, +clubbing, no peripheral edema
neuro: AAOx3. Cn II-XII intact. [**4-7**] in both R/L UE/LE. did not
assess gait. no Pronator Drift.

Pertinent Results:
Pertinent results:
PFTs: [**11-5**]
decreased DLCO, increased FEV1/FVC ratio (greater than 1),
however decreased from previous studies. Findings consistent
with airflow obstruction w/ gas trapping.
.
ECHO: [**10-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic stenosis. Mild
to moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild to
moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
.
Baseline creatinine: 1.0-1.2
.
Colonoscopy [**6-4**]
Polyp at 10 cm in the rectum (polypectomy)
The colon was coated with green stool and it was difficult to
distinguish whether there were other polyps or masses.
Biopsy result: adenoma

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 year old female with longstanding smoking history with
multiple medical problems, admitted for dyspnea/COPD
exacerbation likely due to pneumonia, transferred to MICU for
acute hypoxia possibly secondary to mucous plug, now stable on
O2 by nasal cannula but developed new onset atrial fibrillation,
which is rate-controlled.
.
1.  COPD exacerbation, likely secondary to infection, appears to
have RUL PNA and LLL PNA with effusion (multifocal).
- atrovent nebs to q6 with prn dosing
- albuterol nebs q4 prn -> watch HR with albuterol
- PNA - finished 14 day course of Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin
on [**2122-12-10**] -> should get f/u CXR in few weeks
- wean off nasal cannula as tolerated (patient did not use at
home)
- currently on prednisone taper: 40mg x 3days (last day [**2123-12-11**]),
then 20 mg x 4 days, then off
- consider repeat PFTs as outpatient, last set 2 years ago
- encourage continued smoking cessation
- f/u pending blood cultures, urine cultures
- leukocytosis likely secondary to steroids, continue to monitor
-> c.diff sent, should be followed up as well as blood and urine
cultures
.
2. Cardiovascular:
a. Coronary- h/o ischemia/CAD, s/p MI
-has been ruled out for MI by enzymes and EKG
-continue aspirin, statin, started on beta-blocker.  The beta
blocker may exacerbate her COPD, however, the BB provides a
mortality benefit s/p MI, patient tolerating 25mg [**Hospital1 **], and on
lisinopril 5 mg qd.  (cardiac remodeling benefit with the ACEI,
renoprotective)
b. Pump- h/o CHF, last echo in [**10-8**] w/ normal EF but signs of
diastolic dysfunction (decreased E:A ration, LVH, LAE)
- monitor Is/Os
- metoprolol 25 mg po bid, hold parameters
- lisinopril 5 mg qd
c. Rhythm- new onset atrial fibrillation, but currently in sinus
rhythm.
- continue rate control with diltiazem and metoprolol
- monitor on telemetry
- AC with warfarin, monitor INR for goal [**1-7**] - check [**Month/Day (3) **] daily
.
4. GI- constipation, patient with one large BM today
- patient on standing bowel regimen, use lactulose TID prn for
severe constipation.
- consider enema/disimpaction if patient has not moved bowels
- KUB done X2 without dilated loops or free air, nonimpressive
for bowel obstruction.
.
5. CRI- creatinine appears to be at/ near baseline (of 1.0-1.2).
continue to monitor
-start ACEI (as above under Cardiovascular)- Cr stable with ACEI
-follow I/O
.
6. Anemia:  DDX likely includes anemia of chronic disease,
anemia of CRI, elderly pt.  Could also have component of GI
bleed given chronic constipation requiring disimpaction.
-guiaic stools - negative
-anemia labs ordered, ferritin, TRF, Fe, folate and B12: anemia
labs suggestive of ACD
-h/o polyp in colon [**6-4**] on colonoscopy, bx results: adenoma
-will likely need f/u colonscopy as outpatient if guiaic
positive.
.
7. FEN- no IVF for now, monitor and replace lytes, cardiac diet
as tolerated
.
8. Proph- coumadin, PPI, bowel regimen
.
9. Dispo- to rehab
.
9. Code status-from notes, FULL CODE.
