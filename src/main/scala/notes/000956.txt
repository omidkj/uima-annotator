Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Atenolol / Metoprolol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-6-29**] Coronary bypass grafting x 5: Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery; reverse
saphenous vein single graft from aorta to first obtuse marginal
coronary; reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the
second obtuse marginal coronary artery; as well as reverse
saphenous vein double sequential graft from aorta to the
posterior descending coronary artery and posterior left
ventricular coronary artery

History of Present Illness:
59 year old male in [**2106-2-11**] underwent a coronary CT as
part of a research protocol which revealed a significant Left
Circumflex stenosis. Follow up stress testing did not reveal any
perfusion defects. On [**2106-2-16**] he underwent cardiac
catheterization where he was found to have an 80% OM2. The RCA
was patent and the LAD had a 50% stenosis in the proximal
portion.  An attempt to open the OM2 was made, although was
unsuccessful as the lesion was calcified.
The patient reports that about two months ago he developed new
onset angina. He describes mid and upper left sided chest
tightness associated with pain in the neck and left arm. This
only occurs with exertion, ie. Two flights of stairs. In
addition, he has noticed new dyspnea on exertion. These symptoms
typically resolve with rest or SL nitroglycerin. Recent stress
testing has revealed inferoseptal and posteroseptal ischemia. He
was referred for cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catherization
revealed multivessel coronary artery disease.

Pertinent Results:
[**2108-6-29**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal for the patient's body
size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm on phenylepherine
infusion. Preserved biventricular function, LVEF >55%. Mitral
regurgitation is now [**1-13**]+. Aortic contours are intact. Remaining
exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the
time of the exam.
[**7-2**] CXR:  In comparison with the study of [**6-29**], the various
monitoring and support devices have been removed. Specifically,
there is no evidence of pneumothorax. There has been an increase
in opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the
hemidiaphragm, consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion.
Less prominent atelectatic changes seen at the right base. The
upper lungs remain clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9624**] was a same day admit and brought to the operating
room on [**6-29**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
surgery. See operative report for further details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. In the first twenty four hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and extubated
without complications. He continued to progress but remained in
the intensive care unit on Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure
management. He was eventually weaned off and transferred to the
telemetry floor on post operative day two. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. Physical
therapy worked with him on strength and mobility. He continued
to progress well and was ready for discharge with VNA services
and the appropriate follow-up appointments on post operative day
four.
