CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea and chest discomfort.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53-year-old
female with Crohn's disease with increased dyspnea on
exertion and mild chest discomfort this morning.  The patient
was found to have large bilateral pulmonary emboli affecting
all segmental branches.

Approximately one year ago she was diagnosed with a right
calf thrombophlebitis by her gynecologist in the setting of
estrogen therapy.  The patient was switched off estrogen and
onto monotherapy with progesterone.  No further workup was
pursued at that time, and she was not anticoagulated.

Approximately eleven days ago the patient returned from a
2-hour flight from [**State **] and noted tenderness while walking
up the stairs at the airport.  She then noted left calf pain
over the next several days without swelling which seemed to
resolve over the weekend.

Then, this morning, she was in the shower when she noted
transient sharp pain in her left thigh lasting for minutes,
followed by the sudden onset of chest discomfort and feeling
winded while walking across the room.  Her chest pain lasted
two hours and was resolved by the time she had reached the
hospital.

She was directed to the Emergency Department by her primary
care physician and found to be in sinus tachycardia at 130 to
140 beats per minute.  The patient was hemodynamically
stable.  White blood cell count was 20.  A computerized axial
tomography and arteriogram showed large bilateral pulmonary
emboli.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems was negative for
fevers, chills, headaches, or changes in vision.  The patient
denied syncope, nausea, vomiting, cough, dysuria, or gout
aches.  The patient reports urinary frequency since this
morning.  Positive multiple crampy loose bowel movements (six
to eight per day times one day).

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Crohn's disease for 18 years; on chronic steroids.
 2.  Status post fistulectomy 12 years ago.
 3.  Thrombocytosis; deemed secondary to Crohn's disease.
Peak count is 1.2 times 10:6 per the patient.
 4.  Bilateral cataracts; status post surgery on the right.
 5.  Status post cervical conization in [**2110**] for dysplasia.
 6.  History of pleurisy in her 30s.
 7.  History of shingles on her right face 25 years ago.
 8.  History of right calf thrombophlebitis; on topical
estrogen.
 9.  History of iron deficiency anemia.
10.  History of a miscarriage.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Doxycycline 100 mg p.o. twice per day.
2.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Progesterone topically.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once per week.


ALLERGIES:  CIPROFLOXACIN and BIAXIN (give the patient
hives).  CODEINE (gives the patient nausea and vomiting).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Marketing in sales for a high-technical
investment company.  Very sedentary long daily commute.  The
patient is not married.  She lives with a roommate.  No
tobacco.  Three to four glasses of wine per week.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Paternal grandfather passed away of diabetes
at the age of 88.  Paternal grandmother passed away of
uterine cancer at the age of 48.  Mother's grandmother alive
with a stroke.  Father alive at 80, living with neuropathy.
Mother died at the age of 77 from idiopathic cirrhosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs with a temperature of 99.9, blood
pressure was 126/81, heart rate was 130s and regular,
respiratory rate was 16, and the patient's oxygen saturation
was 98% to 100% on 2.5 liters via nasal cannula.  In general,
a pleasant and well-appearing 53-year-old white female in no
apparent distress.  She appeared comfortable.  She was
speaking in full sentences.  Skin was warm and dry.  Sclerae
were anicteric.  No rashes.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the right pupil was surgical.
The left pupil was reactive.  Positive cataracts.  The
oropharynx was clear.  The neck was supple.  Jugular venous
pulsation about 8 cm.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Resonant to percussion.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed tachycardia, regular.  A 2/6 systolic
murmur at the base.  No heaves.  Abdominal examination
revealed bowel sounds were present.  The abdomen was soft and
nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal examination was
guaiac-negative (per the Emergency Department).  Extremities
were symmetric.  No edema.  No calf tenderness or cords.
Mild tenderness to palpation of the left calf and thigh.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII
were grossly intact.  Fully alert and oriented.  The patient
was appropriate.  Moved all extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 20.1, hematocrit was
29.5, and platelets were 174.  Prothrombin time was 13, INR
was 1.1, and partial thromboplastin time was 26.9.  Sodium
was 141, potassium was 4.4, chloride was 106, bicarbonate was
21, blood urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 1, and blood
glucose was 75.  Creatine kinase was 23.  Troponin was 1.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A computerized axial tomography
of the chest revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli affecting
all segmental branches.  No adenopathy.  No effusions.  A
small pericardial effusion.

A chest x-ray was negative.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a rate of
127.  Normal axis and normal intervals.  Early precordial
transition.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit.  She remained tachycardic but
hemodynamically stable.

She was started on a heparin bolus in the Emergency
Department and was continued on a heparin drip.  A bedside
echocardiogram was done which showed the left atrium was
normal in size.  Left ventricular wall thickness and systolic
function were normal with an ejection fraction of 55%.  The
right ventricular size and free wall motion were normal.  The
aortic valve leaflets appeared structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion.  No aortic regurgitation.  There was
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, but no
pericardial effusions.

The patient was kept overnight in the Intensive Care Unit and
did well.

For her Crohn's disease, she was continued on her home
regimen of doxycycline and prednisone.  The patient was
hydrated with intravenous fluids while in the Intensive Care
Unit.

The patient was moved out of the Intensive Care Unit on [**7-3**] to the Medicine Service/[**Hospital1 139**] Firm.  She was started on
Coumadin 5 mg on the evening of [**7-3**] and was ordered to
have 72 hours of bed rest.  It was decided not to give the
patient an inferior vena cava filter.

The patient was continued on a heparin drip until the
Coumadin was therapeutic.  Coumadin became therapeutic on day
five with an INR of 2.1.  The heparin drip was continued and
overlapped for 24 hours with Coumadin to reach a final INR of
2.5 prior to discharge.

The patient remained on bed rest for 72 hours.  After this,
she was ambulating with ease.  However, she was still
complaining of some mild chest discomfort.

On [**7-8**], prior to discharge, a second computerized axial
tomography was ordered to look at further showering of
pulmonary embolus; however, the results showed a lessening of
clot burden.  The patient was deemed stable for discharge and
was to continue her Coumadin at 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. and was to
follow up with her primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 931**] on
Tuesday, [**7-14**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient's discharge
medications included)
1.  Doxycycline 100 mg p.o. twice per day.
2.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Progesterone topically.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once per week.
5.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to have
blood work drawn to check her INR at her visit with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 931**] on Tuesday, [**7-14**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Large bilateral pulmonary emboli.
2.  Crohn's disease.
