STUDIES:
CXR [**2110-3-1**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Endotracheal tube in adequate position. Orogastric tube
terminates at the GE junction, and should be advanced for
optimal positioning.
2. Left IJ central line extends only to the region of the left
subclavian.
3. Cardiomegaly, with mild volume overload.
4. Dense left basilar opacity, with small to moderate effusion.
It is
unclear whether there is an underlying parenchymal
consolidation. Clinical correlation is advised.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT [**2110-3-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Findings suggest extensive sequelae of chronic small vessel
ischemic
disease; however, in this setting (and given the lack of prior
studies
available for comparison), a small acute infarct cannot be
excluded and MRI, if feasible, is recommended for further
evaluation if there is clinical concern.
3. Paranasal sinus chronic inflammatory disease, as above.
.
TTE [**2110-3-3**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25 %). with depressed free wall contractility.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is mild valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting
of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
81 yo M with multiple medical problems including CAD s/p CABG,
sCHF (EF 20-25%), Chronic AF on Coumadin, CHB s/p BiV ICD & PPM,
Stage IV CKI, and anemia, presenting with lethargy and
respiratory distress, intubated and on on pressors for
hypotension. Pt continued to decompensate, requiring add'l
pressors, and failed to diurese on medical management. Dialysis
was considered, but after discussion with family, pt was made
CMO. Pt was extubated, and expired shortly thereafter with
family at his side.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypoxic/Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: Most likely
multifactorial including hypercapnea secondary to lethargy given
elevated PCO2's on admission. Pt also with volume overload and
question of infilrate, resulting in hypoxia. CVP's were elevated
in 20's, suggesting volume overload. PE was considered, but pt
was supratherapeutic on Coumadin on admission, making this
unlikely. He was intubated from the outside hospital. Lasix gtt
was started for pulmonary edema. Broad spectrum antibiotics
Vanc/Cefepime were started for HAP. SvO2's were monitored and
remained in the 70's.
He was maintained on the ventilator with settings adjusted based
on ABG's. Pt was made CMO, and was extubated.
.
# Hypotension: Most likely [**2-26**] cardiogenic; differential
included hypovolemia, distributive, or cardiogenic. Pt appeared
volume overloaded rather than hypovolemic, and had no signs of
acute bleeding on admission. A distributive picture was
considered, though initially thought to be less likely given
that he was afebrile and only mild leukocytosis. LLL opacity
suggested possible PNA, and he was started on broad spectrum abx
as above, and pan-cultured. Pt appeared volume overloaded, and
had a known EF of 20-25% from [**2108**] at [**Location (un) 620**]. He had severely
elevated BNP to 22,000 and CXR suggestive of volume overload.
His CVP remained in the low 20's on monitoring. Lasix gtt was
started, but he failed to have good urine output. His SvO2's
remained in the high 70's. He was continued on levophed initally
for pressor support.
He developed a temperature to 100.3 on evening of hospital day
2. Given concern for sepsis, he was re-cultured, and required
higher doses of levophed and phenylephrine briefly. However, his
fever curve downtrended. A stat TTE demonstrated EF 25%, severe
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Given that his CVP's remained elevated, cardiogenic
shock was thought to be the more likely etiology. He was started
on milrinone drip for afterload reduction, and levophed was
weaned down with phenylephrine to maintain BP.
Despite maximum doses of lasix, he failed to put out adequate
urine output, and renal was consulted for dialysis. However, a
family discussion was held regarding goals of ca
