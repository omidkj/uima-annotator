Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4854**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bipap


History of Present Illness:
59 year old female with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, frequent
UTI on tetracycline immunosuppresion, ESRD s/p CRT in [**2149**], who
presents with acute onset of dyspnea.
.
The patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 4859**]/09 for
pyelonephritis and e. coli bacteremia.  She presented with
weakness and fever. She was on Zosyn and ciprofloxacin until
sensitivies returned and then switched to oral ciprofloxacin.
She was on tetracycline for UTI suppression by her ID MD, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 724**].  She was discharged with 2 week course of ciprofloxacin.
Also, Cr elevated and felt to be prerenal secondary to
bacteremia but also with some component of ATN, which resolved
with IVFs.  Diuretics slowly restarted upon discharge.
.
The patient went to her appointment with her NP this morning.
Today, her wt was noted to be up 28 lbs from [**2162-5-20**]. The plan
was to increase lasix from 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 120 mg qAM and 80 mg QPM
and to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] on [**6-11**].  After her
appointment, she went home, and around noon, while walking, she
felt acute onset of dyspnea.  She notes increased wt gain since
her recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-1**], but notes that she is
on increased doses of her lasix.  She also denies any medication
noncompliance.  Denies dietary indiscretions, but has been
eating only chicken soup which her daughters prepare for her (1
tsp salt in each batch).  She also drinks 2 glasses of cranberry
juice, cup of coffee, and cup of tea.  She also has been eating
many low salt saltine crackers and ginger ale per her daughter.
[**Name (NI) **] daughter visited her the night prior to discharge, and noted
that her mom wsa tired and weak but not SOB.  Today, though, the
patient called her daughter and complained of "gasping for air"
and then she was instructed to call 911.  The patient then
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  She states she has had subjective fevers
at night for the last 2 days with a cough.  Chest pain with
presentation to ED, but now resolved. No abdominal pain, N/V or
diarrhea.  She has been making good UOP at home.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T(not recorded) HR 96  BP 147/93  RR 44
O2 36% --> then 60% on NRB with good pleth per ED.  Labs were
drawn, significant for leukocytosis 13, Cr 2.3.  Blood culture x
2 and urine culture pending.  VBG 7.24/70/36/31.  UA negative.
EKG and portable CXR obtained.  PE c/w with fluid overload with
bilateral LE pitting edema.  Pt was confirmed DNR/DNI by patient
and daughter.  She was placed on bipap (settings FiO2 100%, PS
10, PEEP 5) with O2 sat 100%.
.
In the ED, she was started on NTG SL x 1 then NTG gtt for
elevated BP (SBP 170-213s) and lasix 80 mg IV x 1 was given
after foley placement.  Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1 and levofloxacin
750 mg IV x 1 given.  She was given 2 mg IV morphine x 1 for abd
pain and repeat 80 mg IV lasix given.  Per ED verbal signout,
she had made 500 cc of UOP.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chest pain, n/v, diarrhea, constipation, abd pain
currently.

Studies:
1. pCXR: Diffuse bilateral lung opacities likely represent
pneumonia
although an element of CHF is also possible.
.
2. Renal transplant u/s: Persistent elevated resistive indices
in the renal transplant, with interval development of forward
diastolic flow. No evidence of perinephric fluid collection or
hydronephrosis
.
TTE [**6-11**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-3-26**],
pulmonary hypertension is identified. Aortic regurgitation is no
longer seen.
.
[**6-11**] RUQ U/S
FINDINGS: No focal abnormality is seen within the liver and
there is no
biliary dilatation seen. The extrahepatic common duct measures
0.4 cm. The
gallbladder is normal with no stones identified and no signs of
cholecystitis. No gallbladder wall thickening is seen and there
is no pericholecystic fluid. A small right pleural effusion is
seen but there is no ascites in the right upper quadrant.
IMPRESSION:
1. No gallstones and no signs of cholecystitis.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
.
CXR [**6-14**]
CHEST RADIOGRAPHS, AP UPRIGHT AND LATERAL VIEWS: Heart size
remains mildly
enlarged and mural calcifications are again noted along the
aortic arch. Right lung base consolidation is improved, with
improved definition of the right hemidiaphragm. Likely bilateral
small pleural effusions persist, along with left retrocardiac
likely atelectasis. No new pneumothorax is seen. A right upper
extremity PICC tip is again seen terminating in the right
subclavian vein region.
IMPRESSION: Right lung base consolidation is slightly improved.
Small
likely bilateral pleural effusions persist.

Micro:
Blood cx [**6-8**]: negative
Urine cx [**6-8**]: negative
Respiratory viral cx [**6-8**]: negative



Brief Hospital Course:
1. Dyspnea: Clinical picture most consistent with CHF
exacerbation with flash pulmonary edema in setting of
hypertensive urgency.  Initially required nitro gtt and placed
on bipap in ED and admitted to the MICU for further management.
Also presented with low grade fever/infiltrates/sob and
therefore could not rule out pneumonia and she was treated with
vanc/zosyn for possible HAP given recent admission.  She was
diuresed aggressively in the ICU with Lasix 160 mg IV/500 mg IV
Diuril combination and was 2L negative on [**6
