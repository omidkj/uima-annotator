Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9152**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, UTI, increased tracheostomy secretions


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
G-tube revision (w/ interventional radiology)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 43 y/o woman with a h/o [**Doctor Last Name 73**] encephalitis s/p
L partial hemispherectomy in [**2085**], refractory seizures, R
hemiplegia, minimally verbal who presents from an OSH with
continued lethargy and supratherapeutic dilantin level in the
setting of UTI and increased secretions from her tracheostomy.
At baseline, pt has a language deficit, refractory epilepsy,
right spastic hemiplegia, and tracheobronchomalacia; she is
trach and G-tube dependent and lives in a group home.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2110-4-3**] with
increased lethargy and hypoxia (84% RA) in the setting of
increased secretions from her trach. Sputum cx from the OSH were
positive for E. Coli and Pseudomonas, UCx grew E. Coli, and
blood cx are neg to date. Pt was started on meropenem and
gentamycin on [**4-3**] at the OSH but developed pancytopenia, so her
abx were changed to levofloxacin on [**4-6**] for the E. Coli UTI
(Pseudomonas was felt to be a colonizer).  She was also
transfused with 2 units PRBCs.  On admission to the OSH, pt's
dilantin level was also elevated to 55, and trended down to 38
yesterday ([**2110-4-7**]).  She is followed at [**Hospital1 18**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] from
neurology and was transferred here for further care.

On arrival here, T 96.5, BP 109/71, 98% on TC. She opened eyes
to voice, but was lethargic and non-verbal, though her reported
baseline is A&O x 3. There was no evidence of focal pain.

EEG: [**2110-4-10**]
This is an abnormal modified telemetry, due to the presence
of continuously higher amplitude delta slowing seen over the
left
frontocentral region, with frequent high-amplitude sharp
discharges
seen over the [**Hospital1 **]-frontocentral regions, with a left sided
predominance.
This pattern is suggestive of a breach defect, with an
underlying
structural defect with high epileptogenic potential. In
addition, the
presence of occasional sharp discharges over the right posterior
frontal
region, phase reversing at F8, is suggestive of an independent
region
with epileptogenic potential. Finally, the presence of a
disorganized,
mixed [**4-11**] Hz theta and [**1-9**] Hz delta frequency, seen throughout
the
tracing is consistent with a moderate diffuse encephalopathy,
most
commonly caused by medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or
infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
43F with Rassmusen's encephalitis s/p L hemispherectomy,
refractory epilepsy, and trach and G-tube dependency at
baseline, who was admitted from an OSH with increased lethargy,
an E. Coli UTI, and Pseudomonas pneumonia.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ACTIVE PROBLEM:
# PNEUMONIA: OSH sputum cultures contained E. coli and
Pseudomonas. Patient was started on cefepime on arrival on
[**2110-4-8**]. Infection disease was consulted.  On the morning of
[**2110-4-10**] she was noticed to have a rash so cefepime was stopped
(patient has a history of pencillin allergy) and was put back on
meropenem per ID recommendations (at that time her blood counts
had recovered).  Due to hypotension necessitating MICU transfer,
CT chest was performed which was consistent with pneumonia.
Ultrasound was used to assess for pleural fluid to rule out
empyema, but there was no significant effusion that was felt
safe to tap.  Repeat sputum cultures here grew Pseudomonas and
MRSA.  Meropenem was eventually stopped due to the patient
having increased seizures and the propensity of this drug to
lower the seizures threshold.  She was placed on tobramycin and
vancomycin for a 10 day course. Levels were monitored and were
therapeutic. She completed the course of antibiotics.

# URINARY TRACT INFECTION: OSH urine culture was growing E.
coli.  Antibiotics were managed as above.

# HYPOTENSION: Pt had labile blood pressures early on during her
hospital stay. On admission, pt was hemodynamically stable with
systolic BPs in the 90s-100s. On the evening of [**2110-4-10**], pt
became hypotensive to the 70s and returned to baseline systolic
BPs in the 90s after 2L of normal saline. She continued to have
labile pressures over the course of the next few days, which
responded to NS boluses. Blood, urine and sputum cultures were
sent with no growth. The pt was continued on Meropenem for her
E.Coli UTI and Pseudomonas PNA, and broadened to daptomycin on
hospital day 3 for empiric coverage of VRE (h/o VRE) in the
setting of continued BP lability. She was transferred to the
MICU on hospital day 6 due to hypotension and requirement for
Q1H suctioning from her trach collar.  Her BP normalized and she
was transfered back to the medical floor the following day and
her BPs remained stable.  Tryptase level was sent to rule out
anaphylaxis.  There was no evidence of sepsis or worsening
infection.  BPs readings eventually seemed more consistent by
using a right leg BP cuff.  She may have also had some degree of
