Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, "fluttering" in chest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. DC cardioversion
2. endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o with hx. severe AS, NSTEMI, CHF with preserved EF, Atrial
fibrillation, presented to the ED complaining of SOB and
"fluttering" sensation in chest. Found to be in unstable atrial
fibrillation with RVR with rate in 160's and sbp in 60's. Was
given Etomidate for cardioversion sedation, cardioverted without
recovery of blood pressure. Was also hypoxic post cardioversion,
so was intubated. She was placed on dopamine for blood pressure
support and given fluids "wide open". Atrial fibrillation
recurred/continued, rate 90's with frequent PVC's. ECG
consistent with STEMI. After discussion with interventionalist -
no intervention planned given age and critical AS. Admitted to
the CCU for medical management under Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]/[**Doctor Last Name **]. En route
to CCU had paroxysm of HR to the 140s in AF with hypotension,
responded to 250 cc NS times one. On arrival, dopamine off.
.
Of note, on last admission pt. was documented to be "clear and
adamant" about being DNR/DNI.

Pertinent Results:
CXR on [**2183-3-24**]:
SUPINE AP CHEST:  An endotracheal tube is in place, with the tip
approximately 1.8 cm from the carina.  The heart is mildly
enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.  The aorta is
calcified.  There is perihilar haze and increased interstitial
markings consistent with congestive failure.  There is
retrocardiac opacity, which may represent an infiltrate or
atelectasis.  No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube tip is 1.8 cm from the carina.
Moderate
congestive failure.
.
CXR on [**2183-3-25**]:
PORTABLE CHEST:  Comparison to a day prior again demonstrates
diffuse
increased interstitial markings and patchy retrocardiac opacity
which may
demonstrate some mild improvement compared to a day prior given
the low lung volumes on today's study.  Patient has been
extubated and NG tube has been removed.  Small effusions may be
present bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Atrial Fibrillation: Patient presented to the emergency
department with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular
response, and was hypotensive to systolic in 60's.  She was
converted to sinus after cardioversion.  She was subsequently
loaded with amiodarone started on [**2183-3-24**]. She is to receive
200mg [**Hospital1 **] until [**4-6**], 200mg ONCE a day from [**4-6**],
and 100mg once a day from [**4-21**] onward for maintenance
therapy.  She should have a TSH and Liver enzymes checked in [**12-31**]
weeks after discharge, as TSH will be unreliable in the setting
of acute illness.  Continue aspirin for anticoagulation.  Will
hold off on further anticoagulation given age and risk of fall,
and also may not even require this long-term if she stays in
sinus rhythm.
.
# ST-elevations: Patient had initial ST-elevations on initial
presentation to the ED.  The case was discussed with
interventionalist on call and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and decision was made
for medical management. ECG done shortly after arrival and after
spontaneous conversion to NSR with rate in the 60's shows
resolution of ST and T changes, suggesting demand ischemia as
etiology more likely than acute STEMI. Patient had episode of
left-sided sharp chest pain on [**2183-3-25**] that was tender to
palpation on examination. Her cardiac biomarkers were markedly
elevated, although this is difficult to interpret in setting of
recent cardioversion.  Continue with aspirin, metoprolol.
.
# Respiratory failure/hypoxia: Initial episode of hypoxia may
have been secondary to CHF. Required intubation. Extubated on
[**3-24**] after discussion with son, and is DNR/DNI. Tolerated
extubation well.  Weaned off of oxygen successfully.  Will start
on low-dose diuretics given history of aortic stenosis.  Also
may have component of pneumonia.  Treating with cefpodoxime, to
complete course on [**2183-3-30**].
.
# Bacteriuria:  No pyuria, however, patient presented in rapid
atrial fibrillation and this could be early indication of
symptomatic infection.  Culture data negative.  Will treat with
cefpodoxime, as has history of TMP/SMX resistance and also risk
of QT prolongation with fluoroquinolones since also on
amiodarone load.  7-day course of cefpodoxime since also
treating empirically for pneumonia as above.
.
# Access: HCP states that pt. would not want Central line - NO
CENTRAL LINE
.
# Code: DNR/DNI: discussed with HCP. Explained to him that this
information was not available to the ED physicians on
presentation and therefore, she was cardioverted and intubated
as indicated at the time. He voiced understanding. He is
currently in [**State 108**]. Son informed that patient is tolerating
extubation well and is otherwise stable, ready to be transferred
out of the CCU.
