History of Present Illness:
Patient is intubated and is therefore unable to communicate
verbally.  History is based on medical records provided by [**Hospital1 **] and Dr.[**Name (NI) 74774**] exploratory
laparoscopy notes.  This 63 yo female had a laparoscopic
cholecystectomy on [**2111-9-14**] and was discharged home on the same
day symptomatic (symptoms not mentioned).  On the morning of
[**2111-9-16**], the patient began to experience severe abdominal pain,
which became worse and she was seen at [**Hospital3 **]/[**Hospital1 74775**] in [**Hospital1 1806**], MA where a CT scan showed an ileus with no
evidence of any other abnormality and a small amount of fluid in
the gallbladder fossa, consistent with the previous surgery.

She has a past medical history of vascular disease with a
carotid artery stenosis and coronary artery disease.  She had an
ERCP because of stones in the bile duct and had been referred
for a semi-urgent cholecystectomy and had undergone an
uneventful laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

The findings at surgery upon opening the patient's abdomen, the
small bowel in the superior mesenteric distribution was
considered "dusky", although
completely and not frankly gangrenous.  The operative site
appeared with no evidence of any bile leak and all staples in
place.  There was no free fluid in the peritoneal cavity.  It
was elected to close the patient, start the patient on heparin,
and refer her to vascular service.

The superior mesenteric artery has a non-dopplerable pulse, but
there is a palpable pulse in the splenic and the common hepatic
artery.  The aorta is considered markedly stenosed

Past Medical History:

CHEST (SINGLE VIEW); CHEST FLUORO WITHOUT RADIOLOGI

Reason: INSERTION HICKMAN LINE UNDER FLUORO

FINDINGS: Two fluoroscopic spot films are obtained in the OR
during placement of a central venous line. These limited films
reveal right subclavian and right internal jugular venous
catheters extending to the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax
is visualized.

[**2111-10-7**] 3:26 PM

BILAT UP EXT VEINS US

Reason: Please do a formal study of bilat. UE - look for DVT

UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler
ultrasound examinations of bilateral internal jugular,
subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic veins was
performed. There is an occlusive thrombus of the right cephalic,
which extends into the right subclavian although this vessel is
not occluded. The extension of the subclavian exhibits
echogenicity suggestive of organization. Remaining veins
demonstrate normal wall-to-wall color flow, compressibility, and
waveforms.

IMPRESSION: Occlusive thrombus in the right cephalic vein which
extends into the right subclavian vein without causing
occlusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**9-17**]: PT ADMITTED TAKEN STAT TO THE OR:

Selective celiac arteriogram, celiac stenting, abdominal and
pelvic arteriogram (CPT codes [**Numeric Identifier 7534**], [**Numeric Identifier 7535**], [**Numeric Identifier 25533**] and [**Numeric Identifier 24945**]).
Failed attempt to cross SMA occlusion.

[**9-17**]

Selective celiac arteriogram, celiac stenting, abdominal and
pelvic arteriogram (CPT codes [**Numeric Identifier 7534**], [**Numeric Identifier 7535**], [**Numeric Identifier 25533**] and [**Numeric Identifier 24945**]).
Failed attempt to cross SMA occlusion

Exploratory laparotomy.

There was no evidence of soilage of bowel contents in the
abdomen.

[**9-20**] - the patient was taken for a planned second look operation
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], She had been hemodynamically stable during the
interim period.

There were several areas of small bowel requiring resection

PROCEDURE:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Small bowel resection.
3. Small bowel anastomosis x2.
4. Ileocolic anastomosis.
5. [**Last Name (un) **] gastrostomy.
6. [**State 19827**] patch abdominal closure.

Transfered back to the CVICU - intubated / pt required
resusitation by meds and fluid


[**9-25**] - patient did begin spiking fevers, reexploration, washout
and closure were indicated.

Bilious ascites with some fecalized material was encountered.
Inspection revealed that the two small bowel anastomoses had
broken down with the beginning of leakage of intestinal
contents.

Vascular surgery was notified intraoperatively and did come into
the OR. All potentially viable lengths of small bowel were
preserved.

PROCEDURE:
1. Reopening of abdomen.
2. Resection of small bowel anastomoses x3.

[**9-28**] - pt spiked fevers again,

Upon entering the abdomen, there was a sulcus free within the
intestinal cavity from a perforation of 1 of the closed loops of
small bowel. Anadditional 18 cm of small bowel was identified
and found to be nonviable.

PROCEDURE:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Small bowel resection.
3. Tube jejunostomy.
4. Abdominal closure.

Since that time, the patient has been stable. [**Hospital 74776**]
transfered to the VICU, then the floor.

Pt required Pain consult to wean of PCA. PCA was removed and
pain control was maintained using a fentanyl patch with percocet
elixir for breakthrough.

The patient has had copious output from her Gtube and Jtube,
managed with a variety of colostomy-style appliances.

[**10-16**] -  She requires agressive fluid and electrolyte repletion,
It was decided to put a permanent line in

PROCEDURE:
Hickman catheter insertion.

Pt had multiple cx's taken during this hospital sty. Her AB were
broad coverage. Prior to discharge her Antibiotics were stopped.
 The morning after she spiked a temperature.  No obvious sources
of infection.  CT abdomen done which showed small collection in
the abdomen, decreased in size from previously.  However, no
ring enhancing with air.  Patient
