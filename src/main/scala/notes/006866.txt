Transferred from OSH for worsening PNA

History of Present Illness:
Pt is 56 yo m with progressive multiple sclerosis, neurogenic
bladder with h/o multiple UTI's, h/o upper GIB, who was admitted
to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital on [**2140-9-28**] with lethargy and
generalized weakness noted by VNA. He had been previously
admitted to [**Location (un) **] in [**Month (only) 359**] and d/c'd on [**9-8**] (diagnosis not
listed in d/c summary, although pt's wife reports 5 admissions
in the past 2 months for "sepsis" or "GI bleeding"). On the most
recent admission, he was noted to have a dirty UA and was
treated for UTI. He was initially treated with levoflox. Pt then
had a CXR which showed RLL PNA, with subsequent CXR showing
worsening R sided PNA, so he was changed to azithro and CTX.
Subsequent CXR's showed bibasilar pulm process. ID was
consulted, and Abx were changed to amp/gent, and then back to
levoflox. Pt intermittently required 100%NRB, but then was
weaned down to 50% ventimask. Pt currently has no complaints,
except being "thirsty". Currently denies N/V, F/C, diarrhea,
hematemesis, melena, hematochezia (although pt had black stools
in the past prior to GIB diagnosis). Pt was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of his PNA.

Pertinent Results:
CXR (prelim): R sided peri-hilar fullness and RLL infiltrate, L
sided infiltrate
.
CXR ([**9-28**], OSH): New bihilar infiltrates and more patchy
densities in the periphery of both lungs may represent
asymmetric pulm edema vs bilateral alveolar infiltrates.
.
CXR ([**10-1**], OSH): Again seen is the L sided air space process.
Much of the increased density has shifted from the lower to the
upper lung field. This may represent fluid in the pleural
fissures rather than a parenchymal process. Hoever, PNA cannot
be excluded. The pulmonary vascularity is congested as before,
indicating CHF. The cardiac silhouette is ill-defined, though
likely at least mildly enlarged. Grossly, no left-sided pleural
abnormality is seen.
.
EKG: sinus tach @ 100, nl axis, nl intervals, biphasic PW in
V1-V2, <1mm STD in V5

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2140-10-7**]):
      FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
      Reference Range:  Negative.

[**2140-10-7**]
CHEST, PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW: Comparison is made to
[**2140-10-5**]. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal and
hilar contours are unremarkable. The lungs are clear, with
interval resolution of previously noted opacities. There are no
pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Pleural thickening at the
apices is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Interval resolution of parenchymal opacities.

ECHO:
Conclusions:
1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is  normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.



Brief Hospital Course:
56 year old male with [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with UTI and
worsening multi-focal PNA likely [**12-24**] aspiration.
.
#) PNA: Swallow evaluation determined that the patient may be
aspirating and a FEES was done. The results are as  follws:
"Mr [**Known lastname 25925**] presents overall with a functional oral and pharyngeal
swallow mechanism. He does appear to be limited by his side
lying, semi-reclined position in the bed, as did appear to
contribute to premature spill over and penetration of thin
liquids. However, no aspiration occurred during the exam, and
strategies were effective at eliminating spill over of liquids
prematurely to the pharynx.

The pt did c/o sensation of swallowing excessive air when
drinking. I explained to the pt that since he drinks from a
straw, this would increase the amount of air he swallows with
each sip of liquid. However, we discussed that this is typical
for people who are dependent upon others for feeding, as a
'feeder' cannot judge how much liquid is 'too much' if they are
given sips via a cup. I did discuss that adaptive cups, with
lids
and handles, may allow him to self-feed and avoid the 'sucking'
action which is increasing his air intake.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Regular texture po diet with thin liquids.
2. Po meds may be given whole with liquids. If too difficult to
coordinate given bed positioning, pt may require po meds whole
with purees.
3. Basic aspiration precautions
