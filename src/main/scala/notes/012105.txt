None


History of Present Illness:
88 year-old Italian male with a history of CAD, s/p tissue AVR,
AF (not on coumadin due to GI bleed), CKD (baseline 1.3-1.7),
HTN, HL who presents with hypotension from Rehab. The patient
was recently admitted on [**10-28**] and discharged to rehab. He
was initally treated with levofloxacin for pnuemonia and
diuresed. His coursed was complicated by MSSA bacteremia which
he was treated with a 14 day course of nafcillin (finished
[**1-5**]). His ECHO was negative for evidence of endocarditis. He
also developed c. diff colitis and was treated with flagyl
(finished [**1-8**]). The patient was discharged to [**Hospital 582**] Rehab.

The patient had complaints of weakness over the last week and
increasing loose bowel movements. He also has had poor po intake
during this same period. He was diagnosed with recurrent c. diff
on [**2137-1-23**] and started on po vancomycin 250mg QID. He
additionally, was started on pneumonia treatment with
levofloxacin 500mg daily. Although the patient and family deny
fevers, chills, cough, sputum or SOB. Today while participating
in rehab he became hypoxic to 87% RA and BP was noted to be
87/42. He was sent [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further mangement.

In the ED, 96.9 96/57 130 20 98% 2L. The patient's CXR showed a
possible left basilar opacity. He was covered with IV
Vancomycin. The patient had a WBC 8.6 and lacate of 1.2. The
patient was hypotensive to the 70's in the ED and improved with
1L IVF. His labs were also signficant for a Cr 2.4 and K 6.3
that decreased to 5.9 on repeat. He did not have ECG changes and
was given 30g of kayexalate. VS on transfer were 86 85/50 25
100% 2L.

On arrival the patient reported feeling hungry and without pain.
He denied F/C/N/V/D/abdominal pain. He also denied cough,
sputum, SOB.

Radiology:
XR CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2137-1-29**] 2:09 PM
FINDINGS: Again is seen cardiomegaly. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. Compared to prior study, an improved
left base opacity may represent atelectasis, although an
underlying infectious process cannot be excluded. Mild vascular
congestion is also seen. Severe degenerative changes are seen at
the left shoulder. Midline sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve
are unchanged. IMPRESSION: Improved left basilar opacity may
represent atelectasis, although underlying infection cannot be
ruled out; mild vascular congestion.

CT CHEST [**2-1**]. IMPRESSION: 1. Persistent left lower lobe
atelectasis, probably has more to do with persistent [**Month/Year (2) 1192**]
left pleural effusion than airway obstruction. Left
hemidiaphragm function would require evaluation before excluding
phrenic nerve palsy. 2. Fixed deformity of the upper trachea due
to a large tortuous innominate artery (common origin of head and
neck arteries) and an enlarged thyroid gland, is probably not
clinically significant. No good evidence for
tracheobronchomalacia. 3. Coronary atherosclerosis,
predominantly right coronary and left circumflex. 4. Mild air
trapping, probably due to small airways obstruction. 5. Severe
global cardiomegaly and pulmonary hypertension, unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
88yoM w/ a h/o chronic diastolic CHF, chronic debilitation and
spends most of the time in bed or chair, presented to the
hospital with dehydration, acute kidney injury, aspiration and
diarrhea.  He was initially treated with IV fluids, found to
have C diff and started on PO vancomycin, found to have
lactobacillus bacteremia being treated with unasyn.  In addition
he became volume overloaded as a result of the rehydration and
he was diuresed for several days.  The most active issue
currently is his hypervolemia which is much improved but still
requires some diuresis.  He was switched to oral torsemide 40mg
po daily (he came in on 60mg po daily but was hypovolemic with
this
