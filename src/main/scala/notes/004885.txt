Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Stridor

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheal dilatation and stent placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 yo woman with DM, HTN and with myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) 2902**] and tracheal stenosis with recent admissions for both who
presents with stridor. Her recent medical history is notable for
an admission from [**3-6**] to [**3-19**] due to myasthenia crisis
requiring intubation and treatment with plasma exchange and her
most recent admission from [**3-28**] to [**4-5**] when she presented with
shortness of breath and stridor and was found to have
significant tracheal stenosis. She was
taken for tracheal ballooning with significant improvement in
symptoms. She was seen by thoracic surgery and interventional
pulmonary teams who recommend tracheal reconstruction surgery
once she is weaned down to a lower dose of prednisone. She was
discharged on a prednisone taper with warning to return with any
symptom recurrence as there was a risk of increased MG symptoms
on steroids.
.
Since discharge, she has had persistent shortness of breath
associated with stridor which was usually self resolving.
However,m she awoke this morning feeling acutely worse and
unable to "get any air in". Denies recent viral symptoms, denies
recent fever/chills, denies n/v/d, denies chest pain.
.
She was initially taken to [**Hospital1 1562**] ED where she was given
bronchodilators and transferred here.
.
Initial vitals were 98.2 82 134/57 20 100% RA. Triggered on
arrival for stridor. Received additional nebs with improvement
in symptoms. Respiratory evaluated patient and determed that nif
-80, VC 1L. She was noted to be bonchospastic with expiration.
did IP has seen patient and thoracis aware. She has also been
seen by neurology and the consult team discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1206**], her outpatient neurologist. They felt that this
presentation was consistent with tracheal stenosis and not
consistent with worsening MG. They recommended continuing
current meds and holding off on IVIG. They will follow.


Past Medical History:
- MG - diagnosed about 3 years ago with body weakness, diplopia,
dysarthria, has only been on Mestinon 60 mg QID
- DM
- HTN
- HLD


Social History:
Lives at home with a husband but she indicated that
their relationship was strained. She is a long term smoker,
smoked 1PPD for 50
years, has cut down to 1/4 pack over last few years.  No etoh,
no
drugs


Family History:
No family history of MG or other neurological
diseases.  Some DM in the family.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: BP: 148/65 P: 81 R: 18 O2: 99 2L
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: significant stridor, louder with inspiration than
expiration, unable to expectorate with cough, MMM
Lungs: upper airway sounds heard throughout. no crackles
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

Pertinent Results:
CT trachea [**4-1**]:
focal stenosis of the trachea at the level of the thoracic
inlet, stretching approximately 7 mm in the craniocaudad
dimension consistent with focal stenosis likely related to the
previously present endotracheal tube. This stenosis is
relatively fixed, with a cross-sectional area at that level
during inspiration of 52 mm2, narrowing only minimally 230 mm2
during expiration. This area is in distinction to the normal
caliber of the trachea, approximately 1 cm distal to the area of
stenosis of 277 mm2. The distal trachea and left-sided airways
are patent. The lungs reveal biapical scar as well as paraseptal
emphysema.
IMPRESSION:
1. Focal, fixed stenosis of the trachea at the level of the
thoracic inlet as characterized above.
2. Secretions in the right main stem bronchus as well as in the
right lower lobe bronchus, with resultant air trapping in the
right lower lobe.
3. Coronary arterial calcification.

Bronch [**4-1**]
Complex tracheal stenosis consistent with post intubation
stenosis. The area measured 3 cm from the criciod and 7.8 cm
from the carina, the lesion itself was 1.8 cm long. The initial
tracheal diameter was 4 cm and was dilated with a balloon, first
8,9,10cm then 10, 11, 12 cm balloon was used. The rigid barrel
was then passed through the stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Stridor: The patient's respiratory symptoms/stridor was
thought likely secondary to known tracheal stenosis. IP was
consulted at presentation with plan to take to OR on [**4-24**] PM
for intervention, possible stent. The patient oxygenating well.
bicarb 34 which is where it was on her last admission for
stridor and improved after dilation to 27 suggesting that she
has some limitation in ventilation.
.
The patient was taken to the OR by IP service and had a balloon
dilation as well as tracheal stent placed. The patient tolerated
the procedure well. Had decreased stridor as well as improved
breathing. She stated that overall her breathing had returned to
baseline. This morning after normal labs and normal oxygen
saturations was discharged with follow up to [**Hospital **] clinic in 4
weeks per IP recommendations.'
.
# Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: no evidence of current worsening. The
neurology team was made aware of the patient's admission. They
did not make any new recommendations other than continuing
current medication regimen for MG. The patient was discharged on
all her original medication and with follow up with neurology as
previously arranged.
