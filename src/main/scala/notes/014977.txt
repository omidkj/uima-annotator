Allergies:
Percocet / Codeine / Morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, diaphoresis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
S/P colectomy, cholecystectomy and hernia repair at [**Hospital3 **] on [**2196-11-3**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7871**] was her surgeon.


History of Present Illness:
At outside hospital, an 83 y.o. with no prior cardiac history,
except for DOE, which may have been pulmonary in nature,
underwent elective laparoscopy for a colon mass on [**2196-11-3**] at
NEBH. The patient also had lysis of adhesions, right colectomy,
and cholecystectomy, along with abdominal hernia repair with
fascia release and mesh placement. She was initially sent to
ICU, and then called out to telemetry floor. On [**11-8**] afternoon,
she complained of difficulty in breathing and diaphoresis. She
also states that she had some tightness in her chest. The
patient had EKG changes with T wave depressions and ST
depressions and was then sent back to ICU. Her first troponin at
3pm yesterday cam back at 0.84. She also had some transient
hypotension last eve down to 80/40, which responded to 250 mL
bolus NS x 2, 11pm trop 0.68, 5am today down to 0.47. She again
had some transient systolic bp down to 80's and received an
additional 250 NS this am. They have been holding her lopressor.
She continues with significant T wave depressions, but no
further shortness of breath or diaphoresis. Lung sounds are
diminished with occasional audible wheezes, slight white sputum,
few crackles this am which cleared with cough, cxr negative.
Large abdominal dressing and 2 JP drains along with abdominal
binder, mepitel dressing to right chest, perhaps secondary to
open sore of unclear etiology.
.
Following her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization. She was then transferred to the CCU floor. She
currently denies any shortness of breath, diaphoresis, chest
pain or discomfort.

Echocardiogram [**11-11**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection
fraction 30 percent) secondary to hypokinesis of the
midventricular segments and akinesis of the apex. The basal
segments are hyperdynamic. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CARDIAC CATH:  [**2196-11-9**]
Left ventriculography: 1+ mitral regurgitation, LVEF=40%,
extensive area of anteroapical and inferoapical akinesis
LMCA:
LAD: 30% mid
LCx: no significant disease
RCA: 40% mid
Most consistent with Takotsubo syndrome.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARIES: Cardiac catheterization did not show significant
coronary artery disease. Venogram during catheterization showed
characteristic apical ballooning, consistent with Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy. EF 40%. 30% occlusion of LAD mid and 40% of RCA
mid. The patient was originally treated with a low-dose beta
blocker. Given the possibility of coronary vasospasm, however,
the patient was switched to verapamil therapy. The patient was
also started on low-dose ACE inhibitor therapy (lisinopril 5 mg
PO daily), given her ejection fraction. Because of presence of
some coronary disease, the patient was started on aspirin (81mg
PO daily).
.
# PUMP: Found to have likely Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with
LVEF=40%, areas of hypokinesis.  Started on verapamil,
lisinopril, ASA therapies. Patient was generally euvolemic by
exam during her hospitalization.
.
# ASTHMA/COPD: The patient consistently had expiratory wheezing
on exam. The patient was provided nebulizer treatments with
ipratropium and albuterol. The patient was encouraged to follow
up with PCP outpatient regarding daily inhaler treatment, as she
was thought to have poorly controlled COPD that would benefit
from therapy.
.
# DEPRESSION:  Continued Lexapro home dose.
.
# ABDOMINAL WOUND CARE:  s/p colectomy, cholecystectomy, lysis
adhesion, hernia repair. Surgery was consulted--they think the
patient can have her staples removed 7-10 days after her
operation (Day 10=[**2196-11-13**]). We are trying to get patient an
appointment with Surgery as outpatient to have staples removed
and also to examine JP drains for removal. The patient's right
JP drain still produced more than 30 mL per day on discharge;
the left JP drain did not.
