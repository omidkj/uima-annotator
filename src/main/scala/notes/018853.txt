Confusion, hypoxia, fever

History of Present Illness:
78 y/o male with Parkinson's, HTN, chronic lower back pain
secondary to spinal stenosis presents with one week of
obstipation, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, two days of increasing
confusion.  According to the family, five days prior to
admission he began to be nauseated and vomited and over the next
few days was noted to be extremely constipated (non-compliant
with bowel regimen [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **] RN).  He ate little and continued to
vomit occasionally.  Three nights prior to admission he became
confused and this progressively worsened and he became weaker.
Two night prior to admission he was found to have a new oxygen
requirement and this increased over the next day, and he became
febrile.
In the ED, he was febrile to 102, hypotensive, tachypneic, and
confused and was intubated as his respiratory status continued
to decline.  He was loaded with 6L IVF and was transiently on a
norepinephrine drip.  Additionally in the ED he was noted to be
hyperkalemic with K+6.0 and peaked T-waves on ECG that resolved
with insulin +D50 and calcium gluconate  Surgery was consulted
for possible small bowel obstruction.  Evaluation revealed
severe fecal impaction, but no SBO. He was started empirically
on Vanco/Levofloxacin/Flagyl.

Rads:
KUB [**7-6**]: IMPRESSION:
1)  No definite evidence of obstruction.
2)  Calcified renal cyst.
3)  The upper abdomen including the hemidiaphragms were not
imaged.  There is no free air seen in the portion of the abdomen
imaged.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2178-7-6**]: IMPRESSION:
1)  Dilated stool filled colon, particularly the rectosigmoid.
There is also apparent rectal wall thickening.  The findings are
consistent with a fecal impaction.
2)  Dense consolidation in both lower lobes which contain high
attenuation
material, suspicious for aspiration.
3)  Extremely limited assessment of the abdomen due to
respiratory motion and beam hardening artifact from the
patient's arms.
4)  Peripherally calcified cystic structure in the upper pole of
the right
kidney with Hounsfield units not consistent with a simple cyst.
This is
inadequately assessed without IV contrast.  Further evaluation
with MRI could be considered.  Two additional likely cysts in
the lower pole of the right kidney.
5) 7 mm non-obstructing right renal stone and tiny 1 mm
non-obstructing left renal stone.
.
Renal U/S:  IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis on this limited exam.
.
CXR [**2178-7-12**] COMMENTS:  Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest
is reviewed and compared with the previous study of [**2178-7-8**].
There is continued mild congestive heart failure with
cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusion.  There is
continued opacity in both lower lobes indicating aspiration
pneumonia.  The patient has been extubated.  The right jugular
IV catheter remains in place.  The nasogastric tube terminates
in the gastric antrum.  No pneumothorax is identified.




Brief Hospital Course:
78yo man with h/o CAD, HTN, Parkinson's Dz, chronic back pain
presented in sepsis, diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and severe
fecal impaction.  During his hospitalization the following
issues were addressed:
1.  Sepsis:  Sepsis was thought to be due to MRSA pneumonia vs
aspiration event in setting of partial small bowel obstruction
brought on by fecal impaction.  He was treated with aggressive
iv fluids and required levophed initially to support blood
pressure.  He was intubated for airway protection, and a right
subclavian central line was placed.  Surgery service continued
to follow during the first few days of hospitalization but did
not feel he was obstructed causing his sepsis.  He was treated
with Vancomycin for MRSA PNA ([**2178-7-13**] = day [**6-18**]).  He also
completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin/metronidazole for
suspected GI source.  Extubation was delayed due to copious
secretions; he was successfully extubated on [**2178-7-10**].
Additionally the patient failed the cortisol stimulation test
and was treated with hydrocortisone.  This was discontinued on
day 5 as the patient was persistantly hypertensive at that time.

2.  MRSA pneumonia:  sputum grew MRSA.  He was treated with
vancomycin and remained afebrile.  Blood cultures were
nondiagnostic.  He will complete this antibiotic course [**2178-7-20**].
 Vancomycin was dosed according to level given his concurrent
renal failure.  A trough shoudl be checked daily with goal
trough 15-20.
3.  ARF:  He presented with an acute renal failure on chronic
renal insufficiency. This was felt to be due to prerenal
etiology given his recent episodes of emesis and fever prior to
presentation.  All nephrotoxic medications were held, and
creatine improved to near baseline with good urine output by the
time of discharge.
4.  HTN:  following extubation, the patient continued to be
hypertensive, requiring a nitroglycerin gtt for control.  Oral
medications were titrated, and the gtt discontinued prior to
discharge.  Goal SBP 140-150 was achieved on amlodipine 10mg
daily, Imdur 60mg daily, Metoprolol XL 50mg daily, and
Lisinopril 20mg daily.  Lisinopril was restarted after
creatinine improved to baseline levels.  Additionally,
hypertension improved with control of the patient's chronic
pain.
5.  Hyperglycemia:  patient was hyperglycemic in setting of
sepsis and with concurrent steroid use.  He was treated with an
insulin gtt for tight glucose control.  This was discontinued,
and he was placed on sliding scale prior to discharge.  He was
not requiring supplemental insulin at the time of discharge.
6. Fecal impaction:  The patient was severely impacted on
admission.  He required repeated soap suds enemas and manual
disimpaction.  He was discharged on a standing bowel regimen of
colace and senna consistent with his outpatient regimen.  Th
