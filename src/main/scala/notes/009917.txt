Service:  [**Company 191**]

ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Epidural abscess.
4.  Paraplegia.
5.  Urinary tract infection.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old female
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
prolonged hospitalization in [**2128-2-21**] at [**Hospital6 **] with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation with respiratory failure requiring intubation.
She also became methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
bacteremic and was treated with vancomycin for ten days, sent
to rehabilitation, and then went home.

She presented back to [**Hospital1 69**] in
[**2128-4-22**] with increased back pain, lower extremity
neuropathy bilaterally, and was diagnosed with
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.  She
also had T6-T7 vertebral osteomyelitis and an epidural
abscess which was initially treated with vancomycin and
gentamicin for 14 days.  She then underwent surgical
debridement on [**2128-5-27**] and was cultured and found to be
consistent with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
osteomyelitis.  She remained with paraplegia postoperatively
and was also diagnosed with mitral valve endocarditis, but
surgery was declined for the endocarditis at that time.

The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2128-5-31**] for a prolonged course of intravenous
vancomycin, and she remained in rehabilitation until [**6-3**]
when the patient noted fevers to 101 to 102, and a cough
initially periodically with yellow sputum, and noted
shortness of breath at rest.  She denied any chest pain or
headaches.  The abdomen was negative.  No nausea or vomiting.
 Occasional diarrhea.  No melena or blood with stools.  She
has had a Foley in place since leaving the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**5-31**].

At [**Hospital3 **], a chest x-ray with possible
right lower lobe infiltrate was seen.  A sputum culture was
sent which was positive for hemophilus influenza per report.

The patient was initially seen at [**Hospital6 1130**] Emergency Department and then transferred here to
[**Hospital1 69**] after being given 2
liters of normal saline, started on a nonrebreather, and
started on dopamine.  She had a left subclavian peripherally
inserted central catheter line placed at [**Hospital6 2121**] and received one dose of 1 g of cefepime
intravenously and was started on Levophed to increase her
blood pressure.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**].

At the [**Hospital6 1129**] Intensive Care Unit,
the patient was weaned off Levophed and maintained systolic
blood pressures in the 110s.  A chest x-ray showed a right
lower lobe infiltrate, and lower extremity examination was
negative for deep venous thrombosis.  A chest computed
tomography was consistent with a right lower lobe
consolidation.

She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 188**].  Here, she was alert and oriented with the above
history.  She denied any shortness of breath or chest pain
and felt much better.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on arrival revealed temperature was 98.6, heart rate was 103
to 108, blood pressure was 90 to 108 systolic over 39 to 70
diastolic, respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was
96% on 2.5 liters by nasal cannula.  In general, she was a
50-year-old female in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat examination revealed her pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear.
Mucous membranes were moist.  Her neck examination revealed
jugular venous pulsation was about 9 mm of water.  A left
subclavian peripherally inserted central catheter line was in
place which was clean, dry, and intact.  Chest examination
revealed decreased breath sounds at the right border,
positive egophony at the right lower lobe, and no wheezing.
Cardiovascular examination revealed distant heart sounds.  No
murmurs.   Normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds.  Soft
and nontender, slightly obese.  Extremity examination
revealed no edema.  The right peripherally inserted central
catheter line was clean, dry, and intact.  A midline scar at
the upper back which was clean, dry, and intact.  A positive
sacral decubitus ulcer (grade 2) with surrounding erythema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed white blood cell count was 13.9,
hematocrit was 26.2, and platelets were 300.  Sodium was 134,
potassium was 4.6, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 33, blood
urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 0.8, and blood glucose
was 106.  Prothrombin time was 13.2 and partial
thromboplastin time was 38.8.  ALT was 18, AST was 15,
alkaline phosphatase was 103, and total bilirubin was 0.2.
Albumin was 1.6.  LDH was 248.  Microbiology revealed sputum
culture with predominant gram-negative rods with mixed
gram-positive and gram-negative; and Clostridium difficile
was negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Left subclavian line was in
place.  Right lower lobe infiltrate.  Negative deep venous
thrombosis on lower extremity examination.

A chest computed tomography with bilateral pleural effusions,
right lower lobe consolidation.  Air bronchogram was negative
for pericardial effusion, gallstones, with no thickening or
fluid.  Extensive destruction of vertebrae at the T6 level
and a right and left paraspinal mass; right 2.6 X 9 X 7.5 and
left 2.2  X 2.8  X 7.

A head computed tomography was negative for any acute
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The patient was admitted to
the [**Hospital1 69**] Intensive Care Unit.

1.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  For her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, she was treated with
nebulizers and puffers with a goal of trying to decrease her
oxygen requirement for her nosocomial pneumonia and
hemophilus influenza.  She was treated with levofloxacin for
14 days.

2.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  For her hypertension, she was
treated with fluids after weaned off pressors.

3.  EPIDURAL ABSCESS ISSUES:  For her epidural abscess and
recent endocarditis (which had been stable), Neurosurgery was
following and agreed with the medical treatment.  No surgery
expected at this time or during this admission.  Will
continue vancomycin.

4.  PARAPLEGIA ISSUES:  For her paraplegia, supportive care
trying to prevent decubiti ulcers.  Physical Therapy was
following and assisting the patient with movement in the bed.

5.  IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA ISSUES:  For iron deficiency
anemia, she was receiving iron three times per day.

6.  NUTRITION ISSUES:  She was on a regular full diet.

7.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  For prophylaxis while in the
hospital, she received subcutaneous heparin without any
reaction.  Previously had been noted to have a possible
allergy which was eventually thought to be heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia; however, here during this hospitalization,
had maintained stable platelet counts with subcutaneous
heparin.  The patient has also been on beta blocker for
prophylaxis during this admission trying to prevent decubiti
by Physical Therapy.
