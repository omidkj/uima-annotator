DISCHARGE LABS:

IMAGING:
CTA HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2192-11-26**]:
1. Large left chronic subdural hematoma, heterogeneous in
attenuation but
containing acute blood products, measuring 3.3 cm in maximum
depth. There is
resultant rightward subfalcine herniation and shift of midline
structures to
the right, by 1.5 cm at the level of foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] and 1 cm
at the septal
level.

2. CTA demonstrates a soft plaque at the right proximal ICA
without evidence
of flow-limiting imaging stenosis. CTA head demonstrates no
focus of active
bleeding ("spot sign"), dural AVF, AVM or aneurysm larger than
2mm.

3. Stable appearance of likely right-sided Zenker's diverticulum
in the
superior mediastinum, at the thoraic inlet.

4. Multilevel cervical spondylosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10816**] was admitted to the neurosurgery service to the
ICU. He was started on Keppra due to question of subclincal
seizures given his transient right arm weakness. His INR was
reversed, surgery was delayed while the subdural became more
chronic in nature. A speech and swallow was completed and was
approved for a regular diet. He underwent a left sided
craniotomy on [**2192-11-30**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Post-operative course
was uneventful. Patient was written for transfer to the SDU from
the ICU on [**12-1**] but remained in the ICU due to no beds in the
SDU. On [**11-1**] the patient was transfered to the floor without a
stepdown bed given his stable examination and neurologic status.
On [**11-1**] his Foley catheter was discontinued and his oxygen was
weaned. The patient was cleared for home with physical therapy
on [**12-5**] and he was discharged stable without issue.
