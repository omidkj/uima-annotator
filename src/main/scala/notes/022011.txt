Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
somewhat unresponsive".

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none at this facility


History of Present Illness:
53 yo LH woman with diagnosis of paroxysmal orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome (POTS), hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
seizure disorder in youth, evaluated in
the past by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1206**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) 3315**], and [**Doctor Last Name 8760**] for these
complaints.

She presented to the OSH about 5 days ago with c/o nausea and
vomiting. This was subacute in onset and she had 4-5 episodes of
voniting that day. She went To ED for evaluation where she was
given antiemetics with some relief. Her BP was found to be high
as 200s-220s systolic , which required IV meds like labatelol 20
mg times 2 . with some control upto 160s systolic. She was noted
to have some EKG changes (ST/T inversions), with prompted
admission and work up.

She was admitted to step down with close watch over BP. she had
labile BP, difficult to control , which required ACEI as well as
BB. At one point she was hypotensive and was noted to be
"somewhat unresponsive". She required fluid bolus and was taken
to the ICU for further care. She was closely monitered and had
EKG which showed ST/T depressions and changes prompting a
cardiology consult. Per report to ICU team and to RN, it seems
that she was on IV heparin but I could not locate that
documented
in the DC paperwork. She was managed with possible diagnosis of
"NSTEMI". She was seen by cardiology who did CATH/ECHO ON [**2191-8-2**]
which showed Ef 60, LAD 25 percent stenosis and left basal
hypokinesia. She was started on plavix as she is allergic to
aspirin. She was on lovenox (appears to be once a day dose).
this
needs to be confirmed in am with OSH physician who took care of
her. She has a right groin hematoma at the site of cath
insertion
but that has been described as stable.

She was seen by ID for high WBC count upto 30k. Per patient she
may have had low grade fevers but not documented in the chart.
No
cough, UTI symptoms, diarrhea. She was pancultured and urine
grew
strep agalacte sp, treated with linezolid for 3 days, after WBC
count has been coming down and she was afebrile. She underwent
abdomen CT which did not show any acute abn and stool for cl
diff
was negative.

She was seen by neurology for "diffuse weakness" since admit to
ICU. patient, at baseline can stand and walks with support for
few steps but has significant postural hypotension, hence tries
to avoid standing up and uses wheelchair, hence she is not sure
of new onet focal weakness but felt generally weak. Neurology
recs- "EMG" which could not be done at OSH. She was noted to
have
HA for 3-4 days, occipital dull diffuse which got little worse
since 1-2 days. MRI brain was done [**8-4**] which showed  right ext
capsule bleed. MRI C spine did not show any cord abn. Because
OSH
did not have neurosurg back up and as pt had recieved care at
[**Hospital1 18**] , she was accepted as direct admit to ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred from [**Hospital 46964**] [**Hospital 12018**] Medical Center on
[**8-4**] for further management of an intracerebral hemorrhage.

At the OSH:
Patient had been initally found to have an increase in your
white blood cells (29.4). Her blood cultures were negative but
her urine culture grew streptococus agalactiae (75,000 cfu). She
was therefore treated with linezolid for 2 days. She had no
fevers since then.

Throughout her admission, she was been experiencing a labile
blood
pressure. At times it was as high as 220/130's and associated
with diffuse ST depressions but no chest pain. She was treated
with IV labetalol and then transferred to the step down unit.
She was diagnosed with hypertensive urgency and was treated with
labetalol and your midodrine was held. Her blood pressure
remained labile during her hospitalization and she was treated
with BB and ACEI. She also had an episode of hypotension
associated with somnolence and was treated with IVF and
Trendelenburg after which she were transferred to the ICU.

She was then then found to have a troponin leak with a max
troponin of 0.95 (cardiac enzyme). She had some ECG changes and
underwent a cardiac catheterization and the EF was measured at
60% and your vessels were remarkable for mid LAD stenosis of 25%
as well as basal anterior wall and LV akinetic. She was
therefore started on
Plavix and Lovenox. After the cath she developed a hematoma at
the cath site.

After the cath she reported feeling fatigued and weak and
recalls
having had a headache. She therefore underwent an MRI of the
brain which revealed a right capsular intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
with minimal edema and no mass effect. Her Plavix and Lovenox
were therefore held and she was transferred to [**Doctor First Name **] [**Hospital 20098**]
[**Hospital **] Hospital.
