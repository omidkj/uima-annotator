Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with COPD, Afib, prostate cancer, thoracic aortic
aneurysm, s/p hip partial replacement, presented on [**2166-9-9**] with
altered mental status, tachycardia, hypoxemia, LLE edema, and
left hip/knee pain.  Imaging studies revealed pneumonia, large
thoracic aortic aneurysm, and multiple blastic bone lesions.
The patient initially required non-invasive respiratory support
but his respiratory status improved, and he has been off of
respiratory support since last night [**2166-9-10**].

healt care acquired pneumonia/respiratory distress:  The patient
presented with desaturation and increased work of breathing, for
which he was started on BIPAP in the ED.
The patient continued to require non-invasive ventilatory
support (CPAP with pressure support) until the evening of
[**2166-9-10**], after which time, oxygenation was maintained with a face
tent mask.  Chest radiography was consistent with pneumonia,
which was treated as healthcare associated pneumonia, given the
patient's residence in a nursing home.  The patient was treated
with Zosyn, vancomycin, and azithromycin.  At the time of
transfer out of the MICU, the plan was to continue azithromycin
for a 5-day course, which will be complete in the early morning
of [**2166-9-14**], and to continue Zosyn and vancomycin for a 10-day
course, which will be complete on [**2166-9-17**].  Legionella urinary
antigen was negative.  At the time of transfer out of the MICU,
blood cultures x 2 were pending and were found to be negative.

Altered mental status: Per nursing home, patient A&Ox3 without
dementia at baseline.  Mental status has fluctuated from hour to
hour and tends to be better in the afternoon.  At his best, the
patient was able to respond to simple commands and answer simple
questions.  The patient's mental status changes were felt to be
due todelirium in the setting of acute infection.  However, CVA
was considered in the differential diagnosis.  The patient  had
a negative head CT.  Neurology was consulted and felt that the
patient's exam was non-focal and not consistent with CVA. The
patients electrolytes remained stable during the duration of his
hospital course.  A repeat head CT showed no interval change.

Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  On presentation, the patient was
tachycardic to 128.  In the ED, he received diltiazem 10 mg IV x
2 and bolused with 2L NS, with improvement of the tachycardia.
In the MICU, the tachycardia recurred and
responded only transiently to diltiazam boluses.  The patient
was started on a diltiazem drip, on which he remained until the
early morning of [**2166-9-11**].  At that time, digoxin was initiated to
provide rate control while enhancing blood pressure, cardiac
output, and renal perfusion.  Rate control and BP were good on
digoxin.  The patient is not on anticoagulation.  The MICU team
contact[**Name (NI) **] the patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], who did not believe that
anticoagulation was in the patient's interest given his fall
risk.  At the time of transfer out of the MICU, the plan was to
continue digoxin for rate control, monitoring the patient's ECG
and checking a digoxin level in the a.m. of [**2166-9-13**]. The
patient's digoxin level remained therapeutic and he his EKG was
unchanged.

COPD ?????? Baseline COPD likely contributed to intiail poor
respiratory status.  Started on 60 mg q8 solumedrol bolus.
Tapered methylprednisolone to 20 mg IV and then transitioned to
PO, where he was tapered off.

Blastic bone lesions ?????? Likely metastasis given history of
prostate cancer and PSA 279.9.  Consulted PCP regarding
management of patient??????s prostate cancer, likely would not want
medical interventions. AFter discussion with guardian, the
conclusion was to not pursue aggressive intervention, including
escalating the patients status to an ICU.  She will consider a
Do not hospitalize order during the upcoming days after
discussion with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as referral to hospice.  She
preferred the patient be transported back to his nursing
facility where he was comfortable, rather than spend additional
time in the hospital.

Externally rotated hip.  LLE shortened and externally rotated.
No evidence of fracture of dislocation on CT.  External rotation
likely chronic per ortho.  MRI of spine ordered to rule out
metastatic lesion. MRI positive for lesions in the thoracic and
cervical spine, no lesions in lumbar spine or evidence of
stenosis.

LLE edema ?????? No clot.  DDx includes venous insufficiency, CHF
(although worse on left).

Elevated CK ?????? [**Month (only) 116**] be due to traumatic muscle injury in the
setting of a fall.  Continuing to trend down.

Schizoaffective disorder
Home meds were held while NPO, then restarted
