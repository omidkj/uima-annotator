Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Giant paraesophageal hernia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Last Name (un) **]-Nissen Gastroplasty


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with significant shortness of
breath and dysphagia who on CT scan was noted to have a giant
paraesophageal hernia with the entire stomach, as well as the
entire transverse colon herniated above the diaphragm. She was
brought to the OR today for repair.

anemia.



Social History:
Former smoker, lives alone

Family History:

Physical Exam:
General: 74 year-old female in no apparent distress
HEENT: normocephalic., mucus membranes moist
Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy
Card: regular, rate & rhythm, normal S1,S2, no murmur/gallop or
rub
Resp: decreased breath sounds otherwise clear bilaterally
GI: bowel sounds positive, abdomen soft non-tender/non-distended
Extr: warm 3+ edema
Incision: abdomen clean, dry, intact with steri-strips
Neuro: non-focal

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2127-12-21**]

CHEST (PA & LAT)
FINDINGS: There is moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left, that are similar in size compared to the
study from five days ago. The feeding tube tip is in the
stomach. Residual contrast is seen in the colon. There is volume
loss in both lower lungs and an underlying infectious infiltrate
cannot be totally excluded. There is right subclavian line tip
in the SVC/RA junction.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2127-12-19**]

VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOWING EVALUATION: An oral
and pharyngeal swallowing evaluation was performed in
conjunction with the speech and pathology department. Under
continuous video fluoroscopy, barium of various consistencies
was administered orally to the patient.

ORAL PHASE: There is moderate-to-severe impairment of bolus
formation. Mild impairment in terms of bolus control was also
noted. There is mild-to- moderate impairment of AP tongue
movement.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Palatal elevation, laryngeal elevation,
laryngeal valve closure, and epiglottic deflection were within
normal limits. No significant residue was noted in the
valleculae or piriform sinuses. A 13-mm barium tablet
administered to the patient was noted to be retained within the
valleculae but cleared with liquids. The tablet was noted to
clear into the stomach subsequently.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: A small amount of penetration was noted
with mixed- consistency barium. There was no aspiration.

IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate oral-pharyngeal dysphagia. For
further details, please refer to the speech and pathology report
from the same day.

OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION
PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
Swallow initiation was timely. Palatal elevation, laryngeal
elevation, laryngeal valve closure and epiglottic deflection
were
all wfl. Pharyngeal transit was timely with adequate pharyngeal
constriction. No residue was seen in the valleculae or pyriform
sinuses, but the pill became stuck in the valleculae and only
cleared with bites of puree. Pharyngoesophageal sphincter
opening
appeared wfl at the height of the swallow.
ESOPHAGEAL SCREEN:
A pan down of the esophagus was completed after the barium
tablet, but noted the pill was slow moving (in part likely [**12-20**]
NG
tube). Per the radiologist, it did clear past the Nissen.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
The pt had one episode of penetration with the mixed
consistency,
but cleared it at the height of the swallow. No aspiration was
seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
pt admitted for repair of diaphragmatic hernia. Case was
initiated laproscopically then converted to laparotomy d/t
hypercarbia. [**Name (NI) **] pt developed PTX and bilat chest tubes
were inserted and maintained on sxn. Pt remained intubated and
admitted to the ICU on low dose neo and fluid resuscitated for
low u/o.
POD#1 right chest tube w/ no air leak and left to sxn w/ air
leak.
POD#2 vent weaned and pt extubated. Tube feed started.
right chest tube d/c'd.
[**12-9**] CT torso: Decrease in oral contrast extravasation adjacent
to lower R paraesophageal region, small amount continues to
extravasate. Mild increase in moderate B/L pleural effusions.
Left sided dependent atelectasis/consolidation. Multiple sub 5
mm pulmonary nodules of the lung apices are unchanged. New
short-term development of the remainder of nodules suggest their
inflammatory origin.
