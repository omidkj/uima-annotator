undegone placement of tunneled HD catheter (R IJ) and also had
AV fistula placed ([**2113-1-26**]).

ED course notable for initiation of vancomycin, levofloxacin and
flagyl, and placement of femoral line.  She was found to have a
high grade MRSA bacteremia, with 7/8 bottles positive from

vancomycin, with hemodynamic stabilization.  Line changed over a
wire, though catheter tip from original line then grew out MRSA.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 73 yo F with CAD, CHF, ESRD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, spinal
stenosis who p/w high grade MRSA bacteremia after recent
placement of HD line.

(1) MRSA bacteremia - Initial source for infection was likely
the Tunneled HD catheter. The catheter was removed, and a
temporary line was placed over a wire at the same site
initially.  However, as her blood cultures failed to clear, the
temporar HD line was removed [**2113-2-7**], and a new L-sided
temporary HD line was placed.  Nonetheless, her blood cultures
remained positive, despite apparently therapeutic levels of
vancomycin, with worsening leukocytosis, and gentamycin was
added for synnergy.  TTE and TEE did not reveal evidence of
endocarditis, though Chest CT suggested probable MRSA pneumonia.
 Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed [**2-10**] and negative for
infection. US of the R sided arm and neck veins was negative for
clot as a source of infection. Blood cultures remained positive
until [**2-12**]. On [**2-15**] she was started on daptomycin iv 6 mg/kg q
48 hours and on [**2-16**] the temporary dialysis catheter was changed
over a wire and the tip cultured with no growth.  CT of the
entire spine with contrast and of the torso was also performed
with the following results:

CT RESULTS [**2-16**]:
* CHEST AND ABDOMEN *
1. No discrete abscesses or abnormal fluid collections are seen
aside from right-sided pleural effusion and associated
atelectasis.
2. Markedly distended gallbladder, with gallstones. This can be
seen in the setting of prolonged fasting, although if there are
symptoms referrable to this region, right upper quadrant
ultrasound could be performed.
3. Marked coronary artery calcifications.
4. Equivocal soft tissue filling defect adjacent to the left IJ
central venous catheter, which could represent adherent thrombus
at the tip. Note that CT is neither sensitive nor specific for
detection of adherent thrombus.
5. Two or three areas of focal consolidation in subpleural
locations within the right upper lobe as described above.
* SPINE *
CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE: Evaluation of the soft tissue windows
demonstrates no evidence of abnormal fluid collection or bony
destruction. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy present. There
is a 7 mm low density right thyroid nodul, which can be
evaluated by ultrasound if clinically indicated. Also,
right-sided pleural effusion is seen, indeterminately evaluated
on this examination.
Evaluation of the coronally and sagittally reformatted images
demonstrates appropriate alignment of the cervical spine,
without significant abnormal soft tissue swelling. Degenerative
narrowing of the disc spaces at C6-7, C7-T1, are seen without
significant facet changes at these levels. Note is made of
marked vascular
