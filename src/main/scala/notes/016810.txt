ERCP:
Impression: Normal ampulla.
Successful biliary cannulation
A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main duct with the
CBD measuring 14 mm.
The intrahepatic ducts were also dilated.
A single 12 mm round stone was seen at the middle third of the
common bile duct.
No filling of the cystic duct.
Successful sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. The
sphincterotomy was performed to facilitate stone extraction and
permit drainage.
Purulent bile was seen exiting the bile duct after the
sphincterotomy was performed.
The stone was extracted successfully using a 11.5mm biliary
balloon catheter.
Multiple additional sweeps did not reveal any further debris.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Recommendations: NPO overnight and assess for pain in the am. If
no pain, advance diet as tolerated.
Watch for bleeding, perforation, and pancreatitis.
Plans for CCY as per surgical consult.
Return to the ICU for ongoing care, IVF, antibiotics.

Liver and gallblader US:
FINDINGS: Transabdominal son[**Name (NI) 493**] images demonstrate
gallbladder sludge
and stones, with a minimally thickened gallbladder wall
measuring 4 mm. There
is no pericholecystic fluid. The patient did demonstrate a
positive
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign. There is intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation, but no focal liver lesions are seen. The liver is
normal in echogenicity.  The main portal vein is patent with
proper direction of flow. The common bile duct is enlarged
measuring 13 mm. Sludge and echogenic debris is seen within the
common bile duct as far as it can be visualized centrally. The
pancreatic duct is normal in caliber. The pancreatic head
appears normal, but the periampullary lesion is not well seen.
IMPRESSION: Choledocholithiasis, with CBD enlargement and
intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. Additionally, stones and sludge are
seen within
the gallbladder with minimal gallbladder wall thickening and
positive
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign, which might represent early
cholecystitis;
correlation with clinical data recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with hx of dementia, HTN, COPD, presenting from OSH with
cholangitis and early cholelcystitis.
.
# Ascending Cholangitis
Patient was admitted with RUQ abdominal pain, leukocytosis up to
24,000, HCT 33.5, PLTs 138, AST 114, ALT 102, TB 3.7, AP 171,
Alb 3.7. She underwent ERCP and drainage placement. A 12 mm
gallstone was removed from common bile duct, which was dilated
up to 14 mm. Surgery was consulted, who felt she was not a
candidate for cholecystectomy at this time and suggested cooling
her off with 10-14 days of abiotics and follow up with them in 1
month in the utpatient setting. She was started on Vanc/Zosyn
(Day 1 [**2182-6-2**]) and blood cultures were drawn. Fluid from the
bile duct is growing GNRs (do not have speciation yet). She was
afebrile and doing well. Plan is to follow up drainage and once
it slows and if she is doing well remove catheter. Furthermore,
she is still NPO and plan is to re-start diet tomorrow. We
stopped Vancomycin today given negative fever and blood cultures
and suspect only GNRs.
.
# Delirium - Most likely exacerbation of her dementia in the
setting of acute infection. She required IV haldol x2 on [**6-2**]
and has been off restraints and doing much better for 24 hours
now. She is much more coherent and almost at her baseline after
family was around her today. She is having good urine output,
but has not moved her bowels in the last 24 hours yet. She will
need antibiotics for her infection. Lytes are within normal
range.
.
# Leukocytosis - Initially WBC of 24 and improved after draining
pus and removing gallstone. Today WBC 13 today. She is afebrile
with stable VS.
.
# Acute Renal Failure - She came with creatinine of 1.5 with
