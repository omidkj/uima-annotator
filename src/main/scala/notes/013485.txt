degenerative arthritis who was admitted following a total left
knee replacement on [**2164-6-18**] at [**Hospital3 **] complicated by
acute exacerbation of his COPD requiring intubation, acute on
chronic diastolic dysfunction. He initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**2164-7-17**] with evidence of wound infection from the operative
site, who is now s/p I&D and left knee liner exchange ([**2164-7-18**])
