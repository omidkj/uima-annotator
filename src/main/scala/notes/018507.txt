History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 63 year-old
physician with hypertension who presented to the ED today for
chest pain. He is relatively active at baseline and runs on the
treadmill three times weekly without difficulty. About 2 weeks
ago, he had an episode of mild exertional chest pain while
running in the cold which resolved with rest. There was no
recurrence. However, this morning at 5:30am he developed
midsternal chest pain initially [**3-2**] increasing to [**7-30**]
radiating down both arms (not to neck or back), and accompanied
by nausea. He initially attributed this to GERD and took
antacids without improvement. His wife then called EMS. EMS gave
him ASA 325mg and nitro SL x 3 with decrease in pain to [**3-2**]. He
remained hemodynamically stable.
.
On ED arrival, VS were 98 155/89 61 18 99%3L. EKG reviewed STEMI
anterolateral ST elevations with reciprocal changes inferiorly.
Code STEMI was called. He was loaded with Plavix and started on
a heparin gtt. He was then taken emergently to the cath lab,
reportedly pain-free. He was found to have a long, 80% mid-LAD
lesion as well as a 70% hazy OM1. TIMI 3 flow in all vessels and
patient pain-free but the significant anterior ST elevations
persisted on ECG so DES were placed to both his mid-LAD and OM1.
Patient started on integrillin. Post-procedure EKG shows
improved but persistent anterolateral ST elevations. He is
transferred to the CCU for monitoring. Nitro gtt is being
weaned.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for minimal sensation of
chest pressure, about [**1-31**]. No dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Micro: MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2113-1-10**]):    No MRSA isolated.
.
Imaging:
PCXR: IMPRESSION: Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of the distal half of the
anterior and distal septal and apex. The apex is not aneurysmal
and the remaining segments contract well (LVEF >50%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Mild
pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2106-7-9**], there is now mild hypokinesis of the
distal anterior, septal, and apical segments with LVEF 50%.
There is now mild pulmonary artery hypertension.

Cardiac Cath:
[**1-8**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
two vessel disease.  The LMCA was normal.  The LAD had an 80%
mid vessel
stenosis.  The LCx had a hazy 70% stenosis in the first obtuse
marginal
branch. The RCA was without significant disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed normal left sided filling

pressures with central aortic pressure of 122/74 with a mean of
95 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of mid LAD with 2.5x28mm Promus
drug
eluting stent postdilated proximally to 2.75mm.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of OM1 with 3.0x23mm Promus drug
eluting
stent postdilated with 3.0mm balloon.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Anterior STEMI
3. Successful PCI of LAD with DES.
4. Successful PCI of OM1 with DES.
.
[**1-10**]:
1. Limited selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed no angiographically apparent obstructive
coronary artery
disease. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease. The
LAD had
a patent stent with a 30% mid-stent irregularity with a 60%
lesion at
the origin of the jailed diagonal with no
