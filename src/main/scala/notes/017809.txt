History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 46371**] is a [**Age over 90 **] M with a
history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG in [**2124**], CHF with EF
of %, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation who
presents with 4 hours of substernal chest pain. He awoke in the
morning feeling well, and worked on his car (changed a bulb,
which involved laying under the car). Afterward he was returning
to his house and he climbed up 10 steps when he had sudden onset
of substernal chest pain. It was [**11-11**] severity, constant.  He
took SL nitroglycerin x 4 or 5 doses with no significant relief.
He also took Tylenol and Maalox without improvement. He began to
feel diaphoretic and uncomfortable, so called his family, who
called EMS to bring him to ED.
.
Of note, he has generally been feeling well for the past few
months. He feels his CHF has been under good control, with
minimal edema, orthopnea or PND. However, he does report
increasingly frequent exertional angina (typically with carrying
groceries or walking longer distances) over the past few weeks
for which he has taken SLNG a few times per week.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were T 97, HR 104, BP 84/50, RR
16, O2 100% 2L NC. An EKG was performed and showed LBBB which
met Sgarbossa criteria for evolving myocardial infarction. He
was given full-dose aspirin and plavix-loaded and taken to the
cardiac cath lab. There, cath revealed complete stenosis of his
RCA graft (felt likely to be old, as wire could not be passed)
and 99% proximal stenosis of his LAD graft. A drug-eluting stent
was placed in this location with subsequent good flow noted.
Given hypotension to SBP in 80s during the procedure, a balloon
pump was placed.
.
On arrival to the floor, he reports feeling significantly better
than earlier in the day and is chest-pain free. He is on 2L O2
by NC but denies SOB at rest. Cannot urinate from the supine
position, but otherwise no complaints at this time.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. No dysuria. No
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]yoM with CAD s/p CABG and prior PCI who presented with
chest pain and EKG changes consistent with inferior wall [**Age over 90 **].
.
# Inferior Wall [**Name (NI) **] - Pt presented with chest pain and EKG
changes consistent with inferior wall MI with peak CKMB of 41
and troponin of 1.03. Pt underwent urgent cardiac
catheterization for revascularization. In the cath lab, initial
angiography revealed an occluded SVG-RCA. Attempts were made to
cross the occlusion with multiple wires. At this point, the
patient's blood pressures dropped, so an IABP was inserted via
the right femoral artery. They then accessed the left femoral
artery, and repeat angiography of the SVG-LAD revealed a 95%
stenosis at its ostium. They treated this lesion with PTCA and
one drug-eluting stent. Final angiography revealed no residual
stenosis, no evidence of dissection and TIMI 3 flow. Patient was
transferred to the CCU for close monitoring. He was stable
enough to be transferred to the floor. Post-procedure Echo
showed EF of 30%, which was similar to his previous baseline. He
was discharged home on an appropriate post-MI regimen including
plavix, aspirin, atorvastatin, and lisinopril. Patient was
trialed on a low-dose beta-blocker but he became quite
bradycardic so it had to be discontinued.
.
# Hypotension - Patient became hypotensive during the procedure
requiring placement of IABP. On arrival to the CCU, pt's
pressures were quite stable, so pt was successfully weaned off
the IABP on [**8-7**]. Pt's blood pressures remained in the low 100s
until the time of discharge, which is likely his baseline as he
was mentating appropriately and clinically quite stable.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES
.
# Congestive Heart Failure: Repeat Echo on this admission showed
essentially no change in pt's EF post-[**Month/Day (4) **] - it remained
depressed at 25-30%. Pt remained euvolemic throughout his stay,
complaining only
