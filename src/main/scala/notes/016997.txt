Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 50 y/o female with h/o LGIBs in the past now
presenting with BRBPR, found to also have a LLL PNA, in the
setting of a hypercoaguble state with history of multiple PEs
and SVC syndrome requiring continuing anticoagulation.  Went to
MICU due to elevated lactate.  Transferred to floor, got flex
sig, clipped bleeding vessel, stable on floor even on heparin
gtt, no other intevention needed, sent home on lovenox bridge to
coumadin.
.
#. BRBPR - The patient presented with 500mL [**Known lastname **] blood
hematochezia and was admitted to the MICU for obervation, and
received a unit of pRBC.  Emergent scope wasn't indicated per
GI, and pt was transferred to floor without incident for a scope
on [**2-1**].  The patient's hct remained stable here, requiring no
further transfusions, and she had no further bouts of BRPBR
during the hospitalization, even when on a heparin drip and even
after a bowel prep.  Flex sig was done, clip was placed, see
their note for full detail.  Bleeding is usually at the
anastamotic site.  Pt was monitored the night of her scope, no
complaints, then transitioned from heparin to lovenox and we
restarted her coumadin.
.
#. LLL PNA:  Patient with elevated lactate, chest pain, and LLL
pneumonia on CXR.  She was started on levofloxacin.  Blood and
urine cultures were sent, which revelaed nothing that would
change management.  Her abx were continued as an outpt to
complete a 5 day course.
.
#. Hypercoaguability:  Patient has a history of recurrent PEs
and remains on coumadin.  This medication was initially held in
setting of GI bleed.  Upon callout to floor, team started
heparin gtt which was continued throught the bowel prep and flex
sig without any recurrent bleed.  The day after the flex sig we
administered 80mgSQ lovenox to begin a bridge to warfarin as we
re-started her previous outpatient dose.  Pt had a history of
SVC syndrome, and while her on the heparin drip she had these
convex localized areas of edema in the supraclavicular recesses
bilaterally.  We serially measured her neck, and found it to be
constant and unchanged over the stay at 43c
