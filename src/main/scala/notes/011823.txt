.
[**2-20**] ekg: Normal sinus rhythm. Within normal limits. Moderate
artifact makes measuring the P-R interval difficult but it seems
to be slightly prolonged. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2143-1-22**] no diagnostic interval change.
.
[**2-20**] CT abd:
1. Diverticulosis. No evidence of diverticulitis.
2. Ill-defined hypoattenuating lesion within segment IV B of the
liver is
unchanged dating back to [**2136**].
3. Degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine, with grade I
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, unchanged.
4. Unchanged renal cysts.
.
[**2-20**] CXR: AP and lateral views of the chest are obtained. Lungs
are clear
bilaterally demonstrating no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly normal. Osseous
structures are intact. No free air is seen below the diaphragm.
.
[**2-21**] CXR: Picc line terminating in mid SVC. No PTX.
.
[**2-21**] CT head: No acute intracranial process, including no
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or acute large vascular territory
infarction.
.
[**2-21**] foot xray: No bony destruction to suggest osteomyelitis.
.
[**2-22**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic left ventricular global and regional systolic
function. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Very small circumferential pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 year old man with past medical history significant for
?SIADH, COPD, BPH s/p TURP ([**1-29**]) with indwelling foley catheter,
ulcerative colitis, non-hodgkins lymphoma, presenting with
severe hyponatremia.
.
#. Hyponatremia: Etiology consistent with SIADH.  Chest x-ray,
head CT, TSH, cortisol all within normal limits.  Treated with
IV fluid hydration, hypertonic saline, now on salt tabs and
fluid restriction with improvement in sodium from 108 to 133.
The patient's fluoxetine was discontinued. CT chest revealed
unchanged prior 2 4mm lung nodules of RUL, an unchanged prior
3mm nodule or right major fissure. No evidence of lung mass.
.
#. Possible urinary tract infection:  Urine culture on [**2-20**] with
> 100K e coli, culture from [**2-22**] with only 4000 GNR, culture
from [**2-23**] pending.  Was initially treated with cipro on
admission, then changed to ceftriaxone on [**2-23**] when
sensitivities of cx from [**2-20**] returned with e coli resistant to
cipro.  Plan to finish 7 day course of ceftriaxone/cefpodoxime
through [**3-1**].
.
#. Diabetic foot ulcer on left heel, infected:  Podiatry
consulted, swab with MRSA, wound was debrided and treated with
vancomycin for 7 days per podiatry recs.. No osteo on plain
film.
-Patient to f/u with podiatry in 1 week.
.
#. Transient Atrial fibrillation:  Transient overnight [**2-23**] -
treated with IV lopressor and PO lopressor x 1, with spontaneous
conversion to normal sinus rhythm.  No further noted recurrent
events.
.
#. Altered mental status/delusions:  Patient is very
appropriate, but had delusions of seeing firemen in his room in
ICU.  Treated with haldol as needed.  Etiology likely
multifactorial from acute illness, ICU course, severe sleep
deprivation, hyponatremia etc.  The patient's delirium
substantially improved throughout his admission.
.
#. Leukocytosis: Patient with elevated WBC on admission to 21.9,
although appeared hemoconcentrated on admission.
.
#. BPH: s/p TURP, on tamsulosin.  Foley removed.  If patient
fails without foley, can replace or straight cath.
.
#. Depression: holding fluoxetine for now.
.
#.Hypertension: Restarted lisinopril.
.
#. COPD: Continue albuterol prn
.
#. Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale, aspirin
.
#. Peripheral Neuropathy: Continue neurontin
.
#. Osteoarthritis: continue lidocaine patch and percocet.
