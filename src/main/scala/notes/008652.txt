Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and anxiety

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with diabetes and COPD, on home oxygen,
admitted to [**Hospital3 1443**] [**2113-7-18**] with increased shortness
of breath, thought to be a COPD exacerbation. He was started on
IV steroids and required occasional BiPAP. Pt has had multiple
admissions to the ER over the last week and has signed himself
out AMA; per pt, he was intubated 3 weeks ago for 24 hours for
difficulty breathing. He is electric-chair bound [**1-27**] chronic
SOB. He reports a baseline 5L 02 requirement at home.
.
At OSH, troponin negativex2 (24 hours apart), but MB elevated.
ECHO at OSH showed a newly discovered EF of 20%, LV hypokinesis.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and
evaluation of possible ischemic cardiomyopathy. The pt has no
known cardiac history, no h/o HTN, unknown cholesterol status,
family members died when pt was a child ([**1-27**] TB).
.
Pt underwent cardiac catheterization [**2113-7-21**] which showed
mild-moderate 2-vessel CAD, no interventions were done. Was
doing fine this evening when he developed anxiety and labored
breathing. ABG done was 7.32/57/379. Prior ABG was 7.39/57/122.
He sounded wheezy and was requesting Bipap ventillation which he
has had in the past. The MICU team evaluated him on the floor
and determined that he was appropriate for transfer to the unit.

.
Pt denies any new chest pain, palpitations, n/v, does report
diaphoresis (constant), SOB is chronic w/ no acute worsening. He
denies any recent fevers or chills, no cough, no leg edema,
denies any current pain. He has persistently decreased appetite,
no diarrhea. Pt endorses daily anxiety attacks requiring him to
stop his car if he is driving, reports a chest tightness and
impending doom with attacks, reports no anxiety currently.

Cardiac Catherization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated moderate two vessel coronary artery disease. The
proximal RCA had a 40-50% eccentric area of stenosis. The
proximal LCx
had diffuse 50% stenosis. The mid LAD had a calcified diffuse
30%
stenosis. The LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease. Of
note,
there was diffuse PVD of the aorta, iliac, and femoral arterial
system.
2. Limited resting hemodyanmic measurement revealed a normal
systemic
arterial pressure at 116/68 mm Hg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel mild to moderate coronary artery disease.
2. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Respiratory distress: Probably a combination of CHF, anxiety
and COPD. Pt sounded initially had few wheezes on exam and
responded well to nebs. Diuresed 1L neg with lasix; since
patient signed out AMA, sent with Rx for lasix 40mg po. Placed
on Bipap overnight for labored breathing; pt reportedly has Rx
for home CPAP for OSA. Elevated BNP c/w CHF exacerbation, but
cannot rule out COPD flare, so pulse steroids and prednisone
taper
.
#. CAD: Pt has no known cardiac history but low EF indicates
cardiomyopathy. S/p cardiac cath [**2113-7-21**] which showed proximal
RCA 40-50% stenosis, LCx 50% stenosis, LAD diffuse disease with
30% stenosis--no interventions were performed. EKG shows sinus
tachycardia with ?ST-depression in infero/lateral leads. Sent
SPEP, iron, for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy work-up.
.
# COPD: home O2 5L, electric chair-bound, h/o intubation, BiPAP
at home as needed. Pt was started on IV steroids x3 days, sent
home with prednisone taper.
- BiPAP overnight
- Advair, Spiriva, Albuterol PRN
.
#. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy: pt does not have evidence of
ischemia, however given severity of lung disease, this may
explain heart failure which has only now been diagnosed via
ECHO.
- monitor VS
- Diuresied as above.
.
#. Sinus tachycardia: pt reports long history of tachycardia
thought listed in OSH records of 98, currently 130s. Pt is not
symptomatic. He does have history of anxiety with daily anxiety
attacks. Unfortunately, needed nebs now which may exacerbate
this.
.
#. Anxiety: very anxious on arrival to MICU, improved with home
BZD regimen.
.
#. FEN: hypervolemic, monitor lytes, repleted as needed,
cardiac/low sodium diet
.
#. Access: peripheral
.
#. PPx: pantoprazole, hep subq, colace/senna
.
#. Code: FULL

Patient signed out against medical advice on [**7-22**], before stable
diuretic dose was acheived and with several cardiomyopathy labs
pending.
