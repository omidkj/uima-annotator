Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 598**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-3-5**] Exploratory Laparotomy, Lysis of Adhesions, resection
of small bowel with anastomosis x 1.

[**2162-3-18**] PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
68M with a history of recurrent SBOs requiring multiple
rounds of enterolysis presented to [**Hospital3 **]recently
admitted on [**Month (only) 1096**] with acute cholecystitis. Due to his
multiple co morbidities he underwent percutaneous
cholecystostomy
tube on [**2161-10-20**]. Patient developed hypotension and oxygen
desaturation with septic shock. As the cholecystotomy tube was
no
longer draining, patient went to the OR and underwent an open
subtotal cholecystectomy [**2161-10-22**]. On [**2161-10-29**] he underwent an
[**Date Range **] with sphincterotomy and stenting of the cystic duct
secondary to a leak at the cystic duct stump.

Patient presented today to [**Date Range **] for stent removal, but was noted
to have worsening abdominal distension over several days, with
no BMs x 3-4 days, and several episodes of N/V, so was sent to
the ED. Patient complains of 2 weeks of mild abdominal pain,
worsening during the past week in the upper abdomen mostly on
the
LUQ, associated with worsening constipation (last BM 3 days ago
after mag citrate). Had been passing flatus until yesterday, but
none noted today.

IMAGING:
[**3-4**] CT Abd/pelvis: Sequelae of multiple small bowel surgeries,
w/early or partial SBO. Distal migration of CBD stent into
duodenum.

[**2162-3-14**] CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No extraluminal contrast to suggest large anastomotic leak.
Intraperitoneal gas and fluid with stranding of the small bowel
mesentery is likely post-surgical. A mid abdominal incision
remains open and packed.
2. Similar appearance of fluid collection in the left anterior
abdomen, which
is better appreciated on the contrast-enhanced study of earlier
today.

[**2162-3-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive occlusive deep vein thrombosis extending from the
left common
femoral vein to the left popliteal vein.
2. No right-sided DVT.

[**2162-3-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Enterocutaneous fistula from the mid jejunum through to the
anterior
abdominal wall with contrast also pooling within a likely
intra-abdominal
fluid collection.
2. Area of caliber change with multiple not as fully distendable
bowel loops in the right lower quadrant beyond a persistent
discrete, although no angulated, point of distinct caliber
change; this confirms the impression that there may be mild
partial obstruction due to an adhesion beyond the point of
fistulization.





Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service and taken to
the operating room on [**3-5**] for exploratory laparotomy with
extensive lysis of adhesions (> 8 hours) and
small-bowel resection x1 with primary anastomosis.
Intraoperatively he developed atrial fibrillation at surgical
hour 8 and received amiodarone load. He was transferred to SICU
post-op intubated and vented for hemodynamic monitoring and
further management. He was weaned and extubated on [**3-7**]
successfully. He remained hemodynamically stable and was
transferred to the regular surgical floor for ongoing care.

Once transferred to the floor he progressed slowly. He was given
a diet and began working with Physical and Occupational therapy.
On [**3-14**] he was noted with enterocutaneous fistula requiring that
a wound VAC be placed over the wound. The drainage output from
this was initially high; a NG tube was placed as well also
initially with high output. The decision was made to place a
PICC and initiate TPN.

On [**3-18**] he was noted with left calf swelling and tenderness. He
underwent a ultrasound which revealed extensive occlusive deep
vein thrombosis extending from the left common femoral vein to
the left popliteal vein bu no right-sided DVT. A Heparin drip
was started and his PTT was followed closely.

His NG was clamped on [**3-22**] for 6 hours with no residual and no
increase in his fistula output. The NG was removed and there has
not been any increase in the fistula drainage since its removal.

On [**3-22**] Coumadin was started with the Heparin drip being
continued as a bridge. He received 5 days of Coumadin, doses
being increased every 2 days. His INR did not increase. It was
felt that he was most likely not absorbing the Coumadin and the
decision was made to stop the Heparin drip and initiate
therapeutic Lovenox - he is currently receiving 80 mg every 12
hours. As the fistula heals restarting Coumadin should be
revisited as he will require long term anticoagulation therapy.

He has remained NPO allowing for fistula healing and will
continue on the TPN in the meantime. He will need to follow up
at least every 2 weeks in the Acute Care Clinic for wound and
fistula evaluation.

He has been recommended for acute rehab after hospital discharge
for ongoing care.
