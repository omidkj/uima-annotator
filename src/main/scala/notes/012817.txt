Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for treatment of Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial Line Placement
Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
This is a 33 yo F with a history of tetralogy of Fallot s/p
repair at 6 months of age, h/o RVOT aneurysm repair in [**2182**] and
syncopal episode with inducible nonsustained VT resulting in ICD
insertion in [**2187-1-14**], who is transferred from an OSH with
multilobar pneumonia, intubated for hypoxemic respiratory
failure, and hypotension.
.
Patient presented to OSH on [**2193-12-22**] complaining of SOB and
fever. Apparently 2 days prior to OSH admission, she complained
of mild, non productive cough, non bloody emesis, and fever of
103. She developed increasing SOB at rest, with L sided
pleuritic chest pain. No chills or muscle aches. She initially
had some diarrhea, that resolved prior to admission.
.
On admission to OSH, Tm 103.3, systolic BPs 80-90s.  WBC was 5.3
with 22% bands.  ABG was 7.41/36/62 on 5L nc. She was
subsequently started on BiPap FiO2 of 100%. She was found to
have a LLL infiltrate seen on chest X-ray.  Echo was performed,
showing some RV dilation.  She was transferred to the ICU at
OSH.  Chest CT at that time showed LLL consolidation of RLL, and
RUL.  She was treated with Ertapenem and Moxifloxacin for
multilobar pneumonia. Vancomycin was added.
.
Of note daughter had [**Name (NI) 30475**] 2 weeks prior.
.
Currently,  patient is intubated and sedated.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain.

IMAGING:
.
[**2193-12-25**] Portable CXR: Endotracheal tube terminates about 5.5 cm
above the carina, right internal jugular catheter terminates in
the lower superior vena cava, nasogastric tube terminates in the
proximal stomach, and an ICD lead terminates in the right
ventricle. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged. Bilateral
asymmetrically distributed perihilar alveolar opacities are
present, worse on the left than the right. These findings are
likely due to pulmonary edema, and less likely due to multifocal
aspiration and infection. A component of atelectasis is also
present in the left base as well as a small left pleural
effusion.
.
[**2193-12-26**] TTE: Tetralogy of Fallot s/p surgical repair. Dilated
right ventricle with mild global systolic dysfunction. Normal
left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Severe pulmonic regurgitation.
.
[**2193-12-29**] RUE Doppler: 1. Acute DVT in one of two brachial veins.
2. No additional site of DVT, although the right internal
jugular vein could not be interrogated.
.
[**2193-12-30**] LUE Doppler: Nonocclusive DVT in one of the two
brachial veins.
.
[**2193-12-30**] BLE Doppler: No evidence of lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 37063**] is a 33 year-old woman with a history of tetrology of
Fallot s/p repair, hx RVOT aneurysm s/p repair [**2182**], hx
inducible VT (s/p syncopal episode) with subsequent ICD
placement. She was admitted to an OSH [**2193-12-22**] with multilobar
pneumonia. She was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure,
given antibiotics, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Flu assay was
negative several times at their facility and was negative here
as well, but daughter noted to have had flu a week before.
.
Respiratory Distress / Intubation: At [**Hospital1 18**] ICU she was noted to
have very high PEEP requirement of 20 with and FiO2 requirement
as high as 90. At one point, it seemed that ECMO might be
necessary. CT showed consolidation of nearly entire L lung with
clear air bronchograms. Her echocardiogram showed normal LV
function with a normal EF and RVH with a dilated RV and mild RV
hypokinesis. There were no signs of volume overload or RV
failure and no shunt visualized on bubble study.  She treated
with broad spectrum antibiotics (levofloxacin, cefepime, and
vancomycin) as well as a course of empiric Tamiflu. BAL cultures
were not revealing and gram stain showed no organisms. She
improved clinically, and O2 and PEEP were slowly weaned. She
developed R-sided effusion that was tapped [**1-1**] removing 800 cc
of exudative fluid, but showing no organisms. She was extubated
uneventfully the morning of [**1-6**]. She had been afebrile for
days, prior to transfer to the floor.  Post extubation, there
was concern for diffuse weakness (non-focal) whi
