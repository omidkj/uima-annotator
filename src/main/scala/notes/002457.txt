Chief Complaint:
Peritonitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 47 YOM with history of ESRD on PD,
H/O endocarditis s/p St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1291**] and MVR here at [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**8-/2156**] transferred from OSH for peritonitis refractory to
systemic antibiotics.
.
Patient was initially admitted to [**Location (un) 16843**] Hoispital with
Upper GI bleed secondary to esophageal ulcer that required no
intervention. His [**Location (un) **] was held and following observation
and stability of his HCT his heparin gtt was restarted. Unclear
when he was exactly diagnosed with peritonitis bc be have no
formal documentation of infected fluid but likely around 1.24.
He was started on systemic Per his transfer summary cultures
grew out klebsiella that is sensitive to amikacin, ampicillin
and sulbactam, cefoxiti, ciprofloxacin, uimipenam and bactrim
but resistent to tobramycin, gentimycin, ceftriaxone, cefepime
and cephazolin and ampicillin. His antibiotic course to date is
unclear as there are references to vancomycin, gentamycin,
tygacil and levofloxacin. Most recently he was on levofloxacin
and tygacil and recently switched to ertapenam.
.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is drowsy but arousable with heparin
gtt running and one PIV. Poor peripheral stick. ABG attempted
for labs. Right femoral line placed under ultrasound guidance.

[**2157-3-6**] CT Abdomen
FINDINGS:

LUNG BASES: There are bilateral pleural effusions left larger
than right.
Adjacent linear opacities are seen in the lung bases
representing atelectasis. Patient is status post sternotomy and
mitral valve repair.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Within segment V/VI of the liver there is a
small focal hypoattenuation which is too small to characterize
but probably represents a simple hepatic cyst. There are no
other focal hepatic lesions. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
biliary ductal dilatation. Gallbladder is collapsed.  The
spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands appear within normal limits.
The patient is status post bilateral renal resections.

Evaluation of bowel demonstrates regions of diffuse thickening
of the small bowel (2, 53) and colon (2,46) . There is
enhancement of the peritoneal layers consistent with the
provided history of peritonitis. There are regions of free
intraperitoneal gas (2, 30). There is an additional region of
extraluminal gas seen in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
(2, 34). The etiology is not entirely elucidated and could be
related to residual gas which was also seen on the previous
study. There is no evidence of extravasated oral contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
to suggest an enteric perforation. The peritoneal dialysis
catheter has been removed.

There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Atherosclerotic
vascular calcification of the abdominal aorta is noted. The
abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.

Since previous study the right femoral line has been replaced
and a new
tunneled dialysis catheter has been placed with its tip
terminating in the
right atrium. Note is also made of another left femoral IV line
the tip of
which terminates in the right atrium.

Findings within the skeleton most consistent with renal
osteodystrophy.

There is generalized anasarca.

IMPRESSION:
1. Continued pneumoperitoneum, which could relate to the prior
presence and subsequent removal of the peritoneal dialysis
catheter. No evidence of oral contrast extravasation to suggest
an enteric perforation. Enhancing peritoneal layers consistent
with provided history of peritonitis.

2. Thickening of [**Known lastname **] of the small bowel and colon suggestive of
ileocolitis, possibly secondary.

3. Interval removal of peritoneal dialysis catheter and
placement of right
femoral vein access tunnelled catheter and left femoral access
PICC line, the tips of which terminate in the right atrium.

4. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 47 YOM with ESRD on PD, [**Month/Day/Year 1291**] AND MCR [**3-3**] to
endocarditis, difficult vascular access trasnmitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
MICU for mangement of ESBL klebsiella peritonitis.
.
# ESBL Klebsiella and GNR peritonitis: Patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughout his MICU course. Culture data
from the OSH shows Klebsiella oxytoca resistant to ceftaz and
ampicillin. Patient was started on IV meropenem and vancomycin
in addition to intraperitoneal vancomycin and meropenem.
Transplant surgery removed the PD catheter on HD#2 ([**2157-3-2**])
and patient was intubated for the procedure though quickly
extubated on return. Fluid from the PD catheter grew
enterobacter cloacae complex senstive to meropenem.  Per ID,
vancomycin was discontinued and meropenmen was continued IV.
Patient felt subjectively improved after removal of PD catheter
on [**2157-3-2**] and he was maintained on dilaudid for pain control.

A right femoral tunneled HD catheter was placed on [**2157-3-2**].
The line clotted during the initial attempted run of HD on [**3-3**].
On [**3-4**] the line was replaced on [**3-4**]. On [**3-5**], the patient spike a
fever to 101 and vancomycin was restarted.  Blood cultures were
obtained, and after 3 days of no growth and the patient
remain
