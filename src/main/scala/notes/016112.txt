HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 41 year-old African-American
female with a history of HIV, dilated cardiomyopathy who
presented to the Emergency Room complaining of left lower
extremity pain.  The patient states that she was unable to
walk today.  She has had left leg particularly in the foot
and shin for about three weeks and had noticed some weakness,
initially unable to walk around her room and developed left
foot pain that resolved with rest.  She did notice some
increased swelling and redness in this area.

On the day of admission the patient noted that the pain
occurred at rest and noted increased pain that was constant
although was worse with pressure and walking.

she does note some chest pain approximately two days prior to
admission that occurred while she was lying supine.  She also
denies any fevers at home, occasional intermittent shortness
of breath, no cough, no exertional chest pain, positive
dyspnea on exertion approximately one block, two pillow
orthopnea, occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  Patient
also denies any dysuria, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, light headedness or dizziness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.4, pulse 120, blood
pressure 110.68, respiratory rate 20, pulse oximetry 97% n
room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat normocephalic,
atraumatic, moist mucous membranes. Pupils equal, round,
reactive to light.  Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, jugular
venous pressure elevated approximately 7 cm.  Pulmonary: no
wheezes, left basilar crackles.  Cardiac:  normal S1, S2, no

evidence of osteomyelitis, pes planus.
Chest x-ray:  cardiomegaly, right subclavian line in place,
no effusions.
Electrocardiogram:  Occasional paroxysmal ventricular

ventricular hypertrophy with left atrial enlargement, T wave
inversion 1, 2, V4 through V6, ST depression in 1 and AVL, V4
through V6.  No ST segment elevation or Q wave.  His
electrocardiogram was thought to be similar to prior
electrocardiogram of [**Month (only) 956**] [**Numeric Identifier 13971**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) HIV:  through sexual transmission
diagnosed in [**2176-1-6**]. Patient was recently restarted
on [**Doctor Last Name **] therapy in [**2185-2-5**] with Adobutadin,
limbividine, avacar, Navaripine.  At that time she had a CD4
count of 334 and a viral load of 12.3 x 103.  However,
patient subsequently self discontinued her [**Doctor Last Name **] therapy about
[**Doctor Last Name **] weeks prior to admission.
2) Multiple pneumococcal pneumonia infections in the past.
3) Thrush.
4) Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia in [**2182-1-5**].
5) Asthma.
6) Anemia.
7) [**Doctor First Name **] in [**2183**].  Subsequent negative sputum cultures.
8) Positive PPD in [**2184-2-6**] treated with ethambutol for
three months.
9) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy for fibroids and
hemorrhagic.
10) Hepatitis C, undetectable viral load in [**2184-2-6**].
11( Herpes.
12) Congestive heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy,
with ejection fraction of less than 20 percent by
transthoracic echocardiogram in [**2184-8-5**], 1 to 2+
mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid regurgitation, mild to
moderate pulmonary hypertension, moderately dilated left
atrium, right ventricle dilation, right ventricular systolic
function decreased.
13) Mediastinal lymphadenopathy with negative subcarinal
node.
14) Positive [**Doctor First Name **].
15) Cardiac catheterization in [**2184-8-5**] revealed pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 28, no coronary artery disease.
16) History of cocaine abuse.
17) Status post transient ischemic attack in [**2184-8-5**] that
lasted for approximately 30 minutes with an MRA that was
negative.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives with her daughter and
granddaughter.  She has used cocaine in the past but claims
that her last use was about on week prior to presentation
(this was disproved by urine toxicology screen).  Social
alcohol use.  Smokes one pack a day for the past ten year.
No pets.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a mother with breast cancer.

ALLERGIES:  Retrovir.

MEDICATIONS:  Was on [**Doctor Last Name **] from [**2185-2-5**] until end of
[**Month (only) 958**] at which time patient stopped secondary to side
effects.  She also states that may have been on Zestril 20 mg
p.o. q day.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1) Vascular:  The patient with left lower
extremity pain and only Dopplerable left lower extremity
pulses at the time of admission, seemingly ischemic in
nature, initially with movement, now at rest.  Patient was
initially admitted to the vascular service.  However,
subsequent to her positive troponin she was transferred to
the Medicine Service.  She was planned for angiogram of her
leg but given her positive troponin vascular service was
recommending cardiac consultation for potential cardiac
clearance prior to angiogram.  Patient was started on heparin
drip.  Patient was subsequently taken to angiogram at which
time she was found to have an occluded left common iliac
artery, external iliac artery but a reconstituted common
femoral artery.  She also had a small filling defect in the
proximal superficial femoral artery and focal occlusions of
the proximal posterior tibialis and peroneal arteries.
Patient also had focal occlusion of the distal posterior
tibialis with reconstitution of these to plantar branches.
Patient was subsequently started on intra-articular TPA for
thrombolysis.  Subsequently [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
further complicated by left MCA stroke thought to be embolic
or thrombotic in nature and therefore further treatment with
TPA was held

Subsequently patient was taken back to the interventional
radiology suite and was treated with multiple stents
throughout her left lower extremity arterial system.  Patient
was continued on heparin drip subsequent to this procedure.
Subsequent to stenting patient had good angiographic results
and eventually patient with Dopplerable posterior tibialis
and dorsalis pedis in left lower extremity with good range of
motion and no residual pain.

Patient was followed by the Vascular Service during her
hospital course.

2) Neurologic:  Patient on the night of admission presented
with aphasia and right sided weakness.  Per neurologist
patient was found to be sleepy but arousable with limited
comprehension, preferential left gaze with dense hemiplegia
of affected face and arm and leg on the right side.  Patient
had CT of head without contrast that showed infarct in the
left lenticular nucleus with surrounding cytotoxic edema
involving the anterior limb of the left internal capsule.
Patient was subsequently transferred to the Neurology Service
and was placed on in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit.  She was
continued on heparin drip and initially TPA was held.
Patient throughout the remainder of her hospital course had
gradual improvement in her right lower extremity with ability
to wiggle toe and slightly lift her right lower extremity off
the bed unassisted.  Her right upper extremity remained
w
