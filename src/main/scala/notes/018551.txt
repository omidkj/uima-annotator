Brief Hospital Course:
#Asthma exacerbation:
It was felt that the patient's symptoms of chest tightness,
wheeze, and difficulty breathing were consistent with an
exacerbation of her asthma.  Initial evaluation in the emergency
department included a negative D-dimer, chest X-ray which was
clear, and blood gas which revealed normal oxygenation.  The
history obtained did not identify a clear precipitant to the
flare.  However, given the patient's repeated evaluations for
this asthma flare in the past week, it was felt that admission
for IV steroids, MDI teaching, and optimization of outpatient
regimen was warranted.  Her acute management involved albuterol
nebs q2h and IV solumedrol 80 mg q8h which was transitioned to
po prednisone 120 mg on the first hospital day.
Fluticasone/salmeterol had been recently added the previous week
to the patient's regimen; this was continued in house.  Peak
flows rapidly improved on this therapy.
The patient was educated about the proper use of MDI, and she
was arranged for outpatient pulmonology and PCP followup to
further optimize her outpatient regimen.
The patient was discharged on a slow prednisone [**Month/Day/Year 15123**].  She was
then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in respiratory distress with
audible wheezing, agitation, and peak flows of 150s
(baseline~300s).  She failed 5 nebulizer treatments on the floor
and was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Upon admission to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was in
visible respiratory distress, not able to speak in complete
sentences, just able to whisper.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was started on IV solumedrol 60 q 8 and
q2 standing nebs.  She was also started on Advair and Singulair.
 She markedly improved with this treatment, able to speak
adequately, w/o SOB, with peak flows reaching into 320s.  The
next morning, she was saturating 96% on room air, with only few
diffuse exp wheezes remaining.  On day 2 of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was
given a dose of IV solumedrol and started on Prednisone 60 PO
qd.  She was called out to the floor.
.
On the floor, the patient tolerated Q4 hour nebs and denied
shortness of breath at rest.  She did complain of new onset
vertigo, felt to be labyrnthitis.  She was started on meclizine
and was able to ambulate and tolerate PO.  The patient also
complained of dysuria and a urine culture grew out P.mirablis.
She was given a 3 day course of bactrum.  Since the patient had
neither a PCP nor [**Name Initial (PRE) **] pulmonologist, she was arranged to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital 191**] clinic and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Pulmonology clinic as an
outpatient.  She is to return to clinic this week for check-up
and obtain PFTs before her appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She
was administered Pneumovax before discharge.  She was sent home
on a 10 day prednisone [**Last Name (LF) 15123**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] asthma action plan, a peak flow
meter, and advair prescriptions.
