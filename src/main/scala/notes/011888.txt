HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient was admitted to the MICU
for hypercarbic respiratory distress.  The patient is a
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure with diastolic
dysfunction, recent [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
admit for [**11-10**] to [**2110-11-13**] for dyspnea and increased
lethargy with hypercarbia requiring MICU admit.  Arterial
blood gases was 7.28, 77, 51, during which she was diuresed
aggressively and had prednisone treated for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare.  She was discharged to
d'[**Hospital1 **] and returned home on [**12-5**].  Per daughter, patient
was at baseline on [**12-5**] and [**12-6**].  Day prior to admission,
[**12-7**], patient's daughter noted that patient was becoming
increasingly lethargic and tremulous similar to prior
episodes of hypercarbia.  Reports no fevers, chills, chest
pain or shortness of breath.  No cough, sputum, shortness of
breath, change in chronic paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or two
pillow orthopnea, diet or medication discretion.  Upper
respiratory infection symptoms, urinary tract infection
symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,
increasing peripheral edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal.
3.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
4.  [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Obstructive sleep apnea.
7.  Right breast carcinoma, status post XRT.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  180 year pack history of tobacco, quit
several years ago.  She lives with her daughter.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.1??????, heart rate 75,
blood pressure 151/60, 93% on BI-PAP, respiratory rate of 30.
Overweight woman in moderate respiratory distress on BI-PAP.
Sclerae anicteric, moist oral mucosa.  Neck thick, supple,
jugular venous pulse obscured by BI-PAP mask.  LUNGS:
Decreased breath sounds throughout, worse at base, bibasilar
crackles, no wheezes.  CV:  Regular, distant heart sounds,
normal S1-S2.  II/VI holosystolic murmur at left lower
sternal border.  No rubs or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  EXTREMITIES:  Pretibial edema 1+
bilaterally, no calf tenderness.  NEUROLOGICAL:  Cranial
nerves II through XII intact.  Tremulous.  Positive
asterixis, moves all four extremities.  Tremulousness
improves after BI-PAP.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 5.8, hematocrit
38.3, platelets 144, diff of 64 neutrophils, 25 lymphs.
Creatinine is 0.7, CK is 49, troponin less than .01.  ABG is
7.19, 111, 36, question of venous gas.  Chest x-ray:
Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus rhythm at 75, normal axis, LVH by
voltage criteria and AVL no significant change from [**2110-11-10**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU for
her hypercarbia and respiratory distress, likely
multifactorial.  Patient was diuresed with Lasix, nebs and
Solu-Medrol for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation.  Patient was also treated with
Levofloxacin since question of pneumonia on her chest x-ray.
The patient wished not to use the BI-PAP and not to be
intubated in the event of respiratory failure.  She continued
to refuse the BI-PAP throughout her hospitalization and
requires increased oxygen use at night and nebulizers at
home.  The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2110-12-9**]
at her baseline.  She did well.  She continued to diurese
gently.  At baseline patient has poorly decompensated
congestive heart failure with poor compliance although she
claims to be compliant.  On [**5-30**] the patient had sleep study
which showed severe apnea and desaturation but refused BI-PAP
phase and has adamantly refused since then.  She sleeps bolt
upright at home, also long smoking history with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, on home 02.  She complains of
excessive daytime sleepiness, weight gain, fatigue and voice
hoarseness.  The patient was diuresed and supplemented with
KCl to decrease metabolic alkalosis and improve ventilatory
response.  She was continued on chronic 02 with goal 02 sats
from 90-92% and continued recommendations for nocturnal
BI-PAP to help with obstructive sleep apnea
and improve ventilation, pulmonary hypertension.  However,
patient has continued to refuse.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable, on satting 92% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  Patient refusing BI-PAP, wants to be "Do Not
Resuscitate" but not DNI.  Discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
and patient's daughter who is her health care proxy.
