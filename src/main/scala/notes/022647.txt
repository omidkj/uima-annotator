Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, s/p L CEA, CRI, CHF, and GERD
who presents with dyspnea and cough.  History obtained by chart
and patient's wife as patient intubated and unable to give.  He
was initially seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**7-14**] with flu-like symptoms
which his wife reports started 2 days prior.  At that time he
complained of cough, occ. productive of green/yellow phlegm,
sore throat, headache, body pains and aches, and fatigue. Also
reported fever up to 101.8.  He also felt a little bit more
short of breath than usual.  He had a + sick contact a week
prior who had cough and fevers.  At that visit a CXR and flu
swab were done and were negative.  Per his wife he continued to
feel more poorly at home, with worsened cough, now more
productive of thick phlegm.  Yesterday he [**Last Name (un) 4996**] feeling more SOB
and was weak, needing assistance to go to the bathroom.  He
declined evaluation in the ED. His wife reports that he was more
confused as well.  She states that he did not have any CP,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  He has continued to
have low grade fevers to 99.
.
In the emergency department, initial vitals: T 98.1  BP 114/50
HR 81  RR 22 88% RA, 95% 4L.  CXR initially read by ED as PNA
and was given levo and later ceftriaxone, however radiology read
it as pulm. edema.  Also given combivent nebs.  BP dropped from
110 ->70s and he was given 2L of IVF.  Initial ABG 7.35/38/88.
BP began to trend down again and CVL was placed.  He was unable
to lay flat and therefore a femoral line was placed.  He became
more tachypneic, diaphoretic and was placed on bipap without
much improvement.  CE returned elevated at CK 704, MB 82 (MBI
11.6) and trop. 1.6.  EKGs with non-specific changes.  Cards was
sons[**Name (NI) **] and felt was c/w NSTEMI in setting of
infection/sepsis.  325mg ASA given.  He continued to have more
work of breathing was intubated after discussion with patient
about his wishes.  After intubation ABG 7.09/63/220 with rising
lactate 3.3-> 5.2.

CXR [**7-17**]
PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Multiple midline sternotomy
wires are
unchanged in appearance. Compared with the chest radiograph
three days ago, there is loss of cardiac silhouette definition
bilaterally, with apparent baseline cardiomegaly. There are
multiple focal patchy airspace and increased interstitial
opacities bilaterally, compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
However, asymmetric pulmonary edema is also possible. The hilar
contours are less well defined compared to prior, secondary to
the underlying patchy opacities. There is no pneumothorax or no
appreciable pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Multiple new patchy airspace and intersitial
opacities
bilaterally. This may represent multifocal pneumonia, or
possibly CHF.
Clinical correlation and follow-up recommended.

Renal ultrasound [**7-17**]
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Moderate distention of gallbladder, cholelithiasis and mild
gallbladder
wall edema, findings are concerning for acute cholecystitis,
correlate
clinically.
.
TTE [**7-18**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the
basal inferior and inferolateral walls, distal septum, anterior,
and lateral walls.. There is a small apical left ventricular
aneurysm with dyskinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at
least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-12-9**],
regional left ventricular systolic function is now depressed
(regional)

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pneumonia
Mr. [**Known lastname 19075**] presented with worsening shortness of breath, fevers,
and cough and was found to have bilateral infiltrates consistent
with pneumonia. He was treated initially with ceftriaxone and
levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. His sputum
subsequently grew out gram negative rods, likely H. influenzae
based on his positive blood culture results. A viral respiratory
panel was antigen negative, with cultures pending as of
discharge.

2) Myocardial infarction
Cardiac enzymes were elevated on presentation. He was evaluated
by cardiology and thought to have experienced a NSTEMI. His
CK-MB peaked at 267 and trended down subsequently. An
echocardiogram was performed and was remarkable for a newly
depressed EF of 35% and near akinesis of the basal inferior and
inferolateral walls, distal septum, anterior, and lateral walls.
He was started on a IV heparin drip. Hypotension precluded use
of a beta blocker, but he was adminstered aspirin and a statin.

3) Ventricular tachycardia
He developed sustained ventricular tachycardia early in the AM
