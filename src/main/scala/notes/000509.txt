History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 33474**] is a 71 year old man with history of severe COPD (on

2L NC at home), diastolic CHF, atrial flutter s/p AVJ ablation
presenting with fevers and respiratory distress. The patient was
last admitted [**Date range (1) 25250**] for SOB and treated for a COPD
exacerbation with nebs, clindamycin for 7 days (given concern
for prolonged QT wanted to avoid quinolones) and prednisone 60mg
prednisone with taper to 30mg daily. The patient was also
recently treated at S. [**Hospital **] Hospital for C. diff with a 10 day
course of flagyl and he finished last week. He reports he did
have some more diarrhea after stopping the flagyl and most
recently had loose stools yesterday.
.
The patient reports that he has been having progressive cough
for the past 3 days. There was increased sputum production
(greenish/white), but not a significant amount. He remained
afebrile, but took his temperature early this AM and it was 102F
with accompanying chills. He also reports that his cough was
worsening. This AM he reported worsening SOB and dyspnea that
prompted him to go to ED. He reports that prior to that his
breathing was at his baseline. The patient is on chronic
prednisone of 30mg daily.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:103.8 P 133 BP 125/69 R 30 O2 98%.
Pt was severely SOB, increased work of breathing and wheezy on
exam. ABG was 7.18/79/62/31, with a lactate of 4. He was placed
on BiPAP and reportly WOB and respiratory status improved. The
patient had been on BiPAP for 1.5 hrs at the time of signout and
per report appeared more comfortable with improved WOB and able
to speak in short, full sentences. Repeat ABG was 7.34/57/79/32.
His WBC on admission was 17.7, CEx1 neg and BNP: 380 (prior
398). Patient CXR did not show infiltrate, effusions or edema.
Pt was given albuterol/ipratropium nebs and levo 750mg IV, Vanco
1gm and flagyl 500mg (unclear per [**Name (NI) **] signout coverage for h/o C.
diff, but no complaints of diarrhea or risk of aspiration). He
was also given 125mg methylpred. The patient was given 1L of
IVF. Repeat lactate was 2.1. Blood and urine cultures were sent.
The patient was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
On the floor, the patient had increased WOB after being off the
BiPAP for transport. He reports cough, SOB and fever. He denied
any current abdominal pain or diarrhea. Pt was hypotensive with
SBP 85-90 and tachy to 110's. He was give 500cc IVF and
tachycardia improved.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies
headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied
chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Cultures:

Stool ([**7-19**]): C diff positive

Imaging:

CXR ([**7-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Echo ([**7-19**]): The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-5-12**],
findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 71 year old man with severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who presented with acute exacerbation and
hypercarbia. A low D dimer ruled out a PE as a cause of the
exacerbation. He was initiated on Albuterol and Ipratropium, IV
methyl prednisone 60 mg q6 hr, Levaquin to cover atypical
bacteria, and BiPap for respiratory support. He tolerated the
BiPap well and was quickly transitioned to nasal cannula, only
requiring BiPap at night. He then improved with less wheezing
and weaned back to his home oxygen requirement. His IV steroids
were tapered, and he was discharged on a slow taper of
prednisone starting at 60 mg daily. He is on chronic home
prednisone PO and atovaquone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**]. His Levaquin
was switched to doxycycline on [**7-20**] because Levaquin interacted
with his Dofetilide to prolong the QT interval.  He will
complete a 7 d
