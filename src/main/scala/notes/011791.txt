History of Present Illness:
50 y/o w/ congenital hydrocephalus and [**Last Name (un) 62109**] syndrome with
multiple VP shunt placements/revisions, who was transferred from
an OSH where he presented with unresponsiveness, hypoxemia and
hypernatremia. On the day of admission, his caregivers at [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 731**] noted him to be lethargic and thus called EMS. During
transport in the ambulance, he has 3 focal seizures. OSH ED
vitals were 98.7F rectal, HR 72, RR 10, BP 89/49, 89% on oxygen
(unknown amount). CXR was completed which did not show acute
intrathoracic process. CT head showed severe hydrocephalus with
shunt in place, no change compared to prior CT from 1/[**2161**]. ABG
on NRB was 7.33/50/82/95%. Labs notable for WBC 6.6 w/ 89% PMN,
HCT 36.2, Na 149 (baseline 135-140), BUN 41, Cr 1.2 (baseline
0.8). Sputum culture showed GPC and GPR. UA suggestive for UTI.
He received Zosyn. ECG without ischemic changes. Dilantin level
was elevated at 27.5, phenobarbital was therapeutic 28.9. BNP
and LFTs normal. Patient is DNR.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was unresponsive and not withdrawing
to pain. He was breathing spontaneously on a NRB which was
tapered to a 50% face mask. Neurology was consulted. He was
started on vancomycin and meropenum given report of GPC/GPR in
sputum and ESBL in urine.

Imaging:
.
Cardiac Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2161-11-18**] CXR: Widespread pulmonary opacification is most
readily explained by pulmonary edema, but particularly since
there is at least small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion,
there is no way to exclude pneumonia, particularly in the right
upper lobe. If the clinical situation is uncertain, CT scanning
might be helpful in clarification. Heart is moderately enlarged.
Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC. A segment of tubing
projected over the right lower hemithorax could be a remnant of
a previous shunt, but is really
indeterminate. The left-sided cerebral shunt traverses the neck,
chest and upper abdomen. No pneumothorax.
.
Negative Urine, Sputum, and Blood cultures.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o w/ congenital hydrocephalus and [**Last Name (un) **] syndrome with
multiple VP shunt placements/revisions, who was transferred from
an OSH where he presented with unresponsiveness, hypoxemia and
hypernatremia.
.
# Unresponsiveness:  Likely multifactorial and per transfer
notes, appears to be recurrent.  We suspect this episode of
unresponsiveness could be due to seizure activity which may have
been precipitated by hypernatremia and/or hypothermia.
Alternatively, indolent infection (UTI/recent ESBL or PNA
considering GPC/GPR in sputum both likely considering culture
data from transfer notes).  The diffuse opacity on CXR is
concerning for possible consolidation.  His hydrocephalus is
unlikely to be playing a role in his current acute mental status
decompensation considering ventricles stable in size and shunt
inplace/intact.  The patient was continued on phenobarbital, and
the phenytoin was initially held since the patient was
supratherapeutic.  Phenytoin was restarted at a lower dose of
100 [**Hospital1 **].  Per OSH record, sputum culture grew MRSA and urine
culture grew ESBL.  Blood, urine, and sputum cultures and urine
legionella here were all negative to date on transfer to the
floor.  Empiric antibotics were started since admission with
vancomycin and meopenem- which covered OSH ESBL and MRSA growth;
this course was completed on the day of discharge.  For
hyponatremia, patient was started on D5W and slowly corrected to
within a normal range.  After 2 days in the MICU the patient
returned to his normal baseline mental status and was transfered
to the floor.
.
# Bilateral opacities lung: Differential included pulmonary
edema from fluid resuscitation or multifocal pneumonia per CXR.
Sputum cultures at OSH grew MRSA.  Chest x-ray shows worsening
pulmonary edema.  Vancomycin and Meropenem were given for a
total of a 10d course. A Legionella was negative.  Blood and
sputum culture were negative.  Agressive pulmonary toilet was
performed. The patient was diuresed with 20 mg IV lasix as
necessary with continued monitoring of electrolytes. At the time
of discharge the patient was on 2L NC of oxygen and the lung
exam was stable. He should continue with PO or IV diuresis and
pulmonary PT at rehab until he has returned to dry weight.
.
# UTI: OSH reports indicate ESBL, had recently been started on
ertapenem [**11-12**].  Urine from the OSH grew >100,000 colonies of
ESBL E.coli susceptible to gentamicin, ertapenem,
nitrofurantoin; resistant to levofloxacin, ceftriaxone,
cefazolin.  Meropenem was continued for a total of 10 days
