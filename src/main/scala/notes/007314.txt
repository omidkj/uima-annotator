Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
Tracheal stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2183-2-5**] Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, balloon
dilatation x2.
[**2183-2-7**] Cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction,

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 y/o male who is transferred from OSH for
treatment of tracheal stenosis revealed on CT scan.  The patient
was originally admitted to the OSH in [**2182-9-27**] with
obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  During that admission, he had
a tracheostomy secondary to ventilator dependence.  He was
discharged to rehab where he was weaned off the vent and was
eventually decannulated and discharged to home shortly prior to
[**2183-1-20**].  Over the previous week, he has had increasing
shortness of breath and has been complaining of saliva getting
stuck in his upper airway.  He represented to the OSH where he
was started on steroids with improvement of his symptoms.  The
patient has had cough productive of clear sputum.  The patient
otherwise denies fever, chills, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, or
hemoptysis.

         WARNING! This isolate is an extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase
         (ESBL) producer and should be considered resistant to
all
         penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. Consider
Infectious
         Disease consultation for serious infections caused by
         ESBL-producing species.
      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing available on
request.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and had an airway CT which showed
high-grade focal tracheal stenosis at level of the
cervicothoracic junction, corresponding to a site of prior
tracheostomy tube insertion. Coronal narrowing to 6 mm at end
inspiration, with component of airway malacia at end expiration,
with further narrowing to 3 mm.  The patient was continued on
steroids because it had helped with his respiratory distress.
The patient also had an echocardiogram which was negative for
patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect and showed
preserved left ventricular systolic function.

The patient went to the OR [**2183-2-5**] for a rigid bronchoscopy and
balloon dilatation, however the stenosis was unable to be
dilated.  The patient went to the OR [**2183-2-7**] for trachel
reconstruction which he tolerated well.  The patient was kept
sedated and intubated to allow the tracheal reconstruction to
heal.  Broad spectrum antibiotics were started for empiric
therapy.  A dobhoff tube was placed for tube feeds.  Lovenox was
started because the patient was considered high risk for DVT.
The patient also developed brief runs of atrial fibrillation
which was well rate controlled with beta blockers.  The patient
had bilateral patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray, grew E. coli
and Serratia from his sputum cultures, and received a
bronchoscopy for therapeutic aspiration on [**2183-2-12**] and [**2183-2-14**].


The patient was able to be extubated on [**2183-2-14**].  The patient
self d/c'd his dobhoff tube and was started on TPN.
Fortunately, he was able to pass his swallow evaluation and his
diet was gradually advanced.  The patient was transferred to the
floor on [**2183-2-18**].  Physical therapy was consulted to assist the
patient with his ambulation.  At discharge, the patient was able
to tolerate a regular diet and his pain was well controlled.  He
will continue with a steroid taper.  From a respiratory
standpoint, the patient had good oxygen saturations with
supplemental oxygen via 4 liters nasal canula.
