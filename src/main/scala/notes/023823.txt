Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, rapid atrial fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82M hx severe dementia, DM, CHF, PVD
(stent x2, most recent [**5-/2101**]), reported recent NSTEMI on [**2-10**]
with trop 0.24 in setting of demand (no records of this), recent
PNA dx at rehab on [**Last Name (un) 2830**], who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after
being noted by staff to be short of breath today with sats of
60% on RA.  He was evaluated and found to have new atrial
fibrillation and evidence of CHF, he was monitored on tele at
the rehab and was noted to go into atrial fibrillation at @245pm
[**2102-2-23**].  He was transferred here for evaluation.  He is unable
to provide history due to his severe dementia.
.
In the ED, he was placed on Bipap initially in spite of 100% on
4LNC and diuresed with 40 IV lasix.  He was rated controlled
with IV and PO metoprolol, with rates in the 100s.  He had
multiple episodes of hypoglycemia s/p 2 amps of D50.  His EKG
showed afib with nonspecific ST-T wave changes, trop was 0.24.
He was placed on a heparin gtt in the setting of possible
ischemia and anticoagulation for afib.

MICRO:
Urine culture [**2102-2-23**] grew out yeast.

ECG [**2104-2-24**]: AF with a rapid rate, extensive non-specific ST and
T
changes, cannot rule out ischemia
.
ECG [**2102-2-24**]
Sinus rhythm. Precordial ST-T wav abnormalities. Since the
previous tracing
sinus rhythm is now present. ST-T wave abnormalities may be less
prominent but
persistent.
.
OSH Echo [**2102-2-22**]:
Findings:
1. Technically difficult and limited study.
2. Normal LV size and systolic function.  EF 60%.  There is LVH.
3. Moderate LA enlargement
4. Moderate to severe MR.
5. No AS/AI
6. Right atrial enlargement.
7. Mild RV enlargement. There is relative right ventricular
hypokinesis.
8. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.  Pulmonary artery
pressure equals 70mmHg plus the CVP indicating severe pulmonary
hypertension.
9. No pericardial effusion.
.
TTE [**8-23**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic valve is not well seen. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with unusually small left ventricular
cavity and hyperdynamic systolic function. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. Most valves were not well-visualized due to poor
image quality and tachycardia. Recommend repeat study when heart
rate slower.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-7-6**],
image quality is poor. Resting heart rate is faster. LV cavity
size is now smaller and function is hyperdynamic. Estimated
pulmonary artery pressures are lower, which may be due to
technical differences rather than true change in pulmonary
artery pressure. Valve regurgitation cannot be compared given
limitations in current study.
.
TTE [**2102-2-24**]
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mild (non-obstructive) focal
hypertrophy of the basal septum. Normal LV cavity size. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Mildy dilated aortic root. Focal calcifications in aortic
root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Myxomatous
mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP. Moderate mitral annular
calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Moderate to severe
(3+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Moderate
[2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for
PDA
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal
hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
