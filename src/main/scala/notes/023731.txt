Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68 y.o.m. with T4 paraplegia, CAD, CHF, sacral decubitus ulcers,
UTIs, PE w/p IVC filter on anticoagulation who presents.

Presents from [**Hospital **] rehab with 5 days intermittent SSCP on
right side, abdominal discomfort, decreased appetite, nausea,
?emesis.  Also with shortness of breath over last couple of days
and increasing cough over last couple of weeks.  Abdominal pain
is chronic and has been present for years.  No fevers, chills.
EMS stated SBPs were 70s, responded to NS bolus.

.

In the ED vitals were 98, 92, 91/63, 28, 100% 2L.  BP decreased
to a low of 89/64, blood cultures and lactate drawn and given
vanc IV 1gm and zosyn IV 1 gm and 1LNS.  Guaiac negative.
Impression was for abdominal source [**3-13**] to sacral decub -> CT
Abd/Pelvis showed large infra sacral decub fluid collection with
possible abscess formation and associated rectal thickening.

.

Of note, that patient has had multiple admissions in the past,
the most recent from [**Date range (1) 45260**] for hypotension requiring
pressors.  Etiology unclear but felt to be either line vs. UTI
vs. sacral decub.  He was treated with meropenem, vancomycin,
flagyl, and ciprofloxacin, PICC removed, foley changed. Plastic
surgery evaluated sacral decubs and did not feel they were the
source of his sepsis.  Influenza negative.  Plan was to receive
two week course of meropenem and vancomycin given no clear
source of infection (completed [**5-27**]).   Discharge summary states
that pt should have serial blood and urine cultures, as well as
wound evaluation by plastic surgery, prior to initiating further
antibiotics as repeted episodes of hypotension with no culture
data to guide antibiotic therapy.  Prior discharge was after
admission for code stroke [**4-21**]--[**4-27**] which at the end, it was
thought to be a seizure episode. Prior to that, admitted
[**2106-4-6**]- [**2106-4-15**] for fever and hypotension treated for UTI and
wound infection with Vanc/Zosyn completed on [**4-21**].

Past Medical History:
1. Inflammatory disease of the spinal cord of uncertain

etiology.  MRA [**10-16**] negative for vascular malformation.  Initial


CSF analysis showed elevated protein (82) without oligoclonal

bands.  NMO blood titer negative, RPR negative, Lyme serology
negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, Ro and La negative, ACE level normal,
neuromyelitis IgG negative, ESR 70, CRP 66.8.  Ultimately
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids (two
weeks of Solu-Medrol followed by a prednisone taper), and 5 days
of mannitol without improvement.  He is followed by neurology
for a dense paraplegia (T4) with neuropathic pain, restrictive
shoulder arthropathy, and a neurogenic bladder requiring a
chronic indwelling foley.

2. Chronic sacral decubitus ulcer, previously treated with a VAC
Dressing

3. Multiple UTI (including Pseudomonas)

4. Pulmonary embolus [**11-15**] s/p IVC filter placement

5. Asthma

6. Two-vessel coronary artery disease s/p CABG 4-5 years ago

7. Systolic CHF (EF 25-30% on [**2-15**] TTE)

8. Repaired liver laceration

9. Chronic back pain

10. Vitiligo

11. Feeding tube

12. Depression

13. MRSA from sacral swab and sputum

14. Prior transient episodes of leg paralysis

15. Right frontal lobe brain lesion biopsied [**11-15**] and c/w

gliosis; resolved on repeat imaging

16. Abnormal visual evoked potentials


Social History:

countries) in the [**2068**].  He is retired from a job in the
maritime industry.  Divorced 24 years ago.  Three children.

Pertinent Results:
IMPRESSION:
1. Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in the right lower lobe concerning for
infectious process. Given the presence of copious secretions in
the airways aspiration should also be considered.
2. Large infra-sacral decubitus ulcer with possible abscess
formation. Associated rectal thickening could be representing
reactive changes or infectious involvement.
3. Left renal cyst.
4. IVC filter.
5. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
68-year-old man with severe shock (source most likely decub, but
UTI and PICC line also in DDx) on a background history of T4
paraplegia (?myelitis) complicated by decubiti, neurogenic
bladder, PEs and UTIs.
.

# Hypotension

History autonomic dysfunction with component likely urosepsis
with acinetobacter sensitive to tobramycin, patient completed 7
day course. Patient also was treated with a course of vancomycin
and cefepime to treat suspected underlying pneumonic process
given tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities at right lower lobe on CTA chest.
MRI to evaluate for osteo prior to discharge to assess for
change in osteo was unrevealing. Cortstym test was appropriate.
PICC line was kept in place. Foley changed on admission. Patient
was off pressors with stable blood pressure, he was alert and
oriented and UOP was appropriate at the time of discharge.
.

# Decubitus ulcers

Evaluated by both plastic and general surgery who did not think
wound was actively infected. Stage IV documented sacral decubiti
ulcers which underwent debridement per surgery. MRI did not show
any evidence of new infection and did not warrant further
treatment with antibiotics.
.

# PE s/p IVC filter

Hold warfarin today; goal INR 2 ?????? 3.  Monitor closely.  If he
does not continue his rapid improvement, convert to heparin and
hold warfarin. Multiple abx on board likely affecting level.
.

# CAD/CHF (systolic, chronic)
No evidence of volume overload.  Hold antihypertensives;
continue aspirin.
His troponin is elevated, but appears to be chronically so (for
unclear reasons) ?????? does not appear to be ACS/unstable plaque.
Ruled out for ACS with 3 negative enzymes
