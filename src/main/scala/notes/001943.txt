PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs with temperature of 97.0
F.; pulse is 58; respiratory rate 18; blood pressure 186/55;
O2 saturation equals 98% on two liters nasal cannula.  In
general, alert, cooperative white male in no acute distress.
HEENT: Pupils equally and round.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Neck:  Range of motion within normal limits.
Carotids palpable; no bruits.  Chest:  Heart is regular rate
and rhythm without murmur.  Lungs clear bilaterally.  Abdomen
soft, nontender.  Extremities with right sheath in place in
right groin.  Feet warm.  Sensation and motor function intact
bilaterally.  Pulse examination:  Femoral pulses palpable
bilaterally.  Popliteal pulses nonpalpable bilaterally.
Right dorsalis pedis has a Doppler signal.  Right posterior
tibial and left pedal pulses have no Doppler signals.

ADMISSION LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 13.1,
hematocrit 39.7, platelets 201,000.  Creatinine 3.8, PT 12.8,
INR 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
following an arteriogram done by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The
left internal iliac artery and the left femoral to dorsalis
pedis bypass graft were occluded.  Thrombolysis with TPA was
started.

Post procedure, the patient's popliteal artery and bypass
graft became palpable.  There was a monophasic Doppler signal
of the left dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses.

About 24 hours later, the patient left his pedal Doppler
signals on the left.  He was maintained on heparin at 5000
units per hour as well as the TPA.  The patient denied any
rest pain.

The following day, [**2125-4-18**], the arteriogram was repeated
to assess the distal embolization.  A #4 French sheath was
placed in the bypass graft on the left and lysis of the
dorsalis pedis artery with a 1 mg bolus of TPA was initiated.
Post procedure, the patient's left foot was warmer with
increased capillary refill but the patient still had some
foot pain.

Vein mapping of arms and legs was done.  Right cephalic vein
was measured.  Left saphenous and basilic veins had been
harvested.  Lesser saphenous veins were not visualized.

The patient was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells
for a hematocrit of 27.0.  Hematocrit at time of dictation is
29.0.

Anti-coagulation with Coumadin was started.  The patient was
maintained on Lovenox until the patient became therapeutic.
At the time of dictation, the patient's INR was 4.0 after
several days of 5 mg of Coumadin.  His dose of Coumadin will
be adjusted to maintain an INR of approximately 2.5.

On [**2125-4-22**], petechiae were seen on the patient's left
foot.  Physical Therapy assessed the patient and felt that in
another day he would be safe to be discharged home.  The
patient was able to walk the hospital corridor fairly
comfortably with some pain but much less than on admission.

The Renal Service followed the patient and managed his
peritoneal dialysis.

At the time of dictation, the patient has a palpable left
graft pulse and a Doppler signal at the left dorsalis pedis.
He will be instructed when to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
the office at the time of discharge.  He will have INR
checked twice per week with results called in to Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office and Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly.

1.  Coumadin, dose to be determined at discharge.
2.  Digoxin 0.0625 mg p.o. q. day.
