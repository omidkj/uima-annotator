Studies:
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2190-9-7**] 9:29 PM
1. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of obstruction
or definite free air.
2. Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and bilateral hips.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-9-7**] 9:29 PM
IMPRESSION: Within normal limits.
.
EGD Report [**2190-9-8**]
No source of bleeding seen through mid-jejunum.
.
Small Bowel Enteroscopy Report [**2190-9-9**]
Blood in the stomach; Diverticulum in the second part of the
duodenum; Blood in the duodenum; Blood in the jejunum; Otherwise
normal small bowel enteroscopy to proximal jejunum.  No specific
site of bleeding found, though.
.
GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2190-9-9**]
Activity is seen in the stomach and in the epigastric / left
upper quadrant region. The epigastric / left upper quadrant
activity most likely
represents transit of activity from the stomach through the
proximal small
bowel. The pattern of uptake in the stomach suggests the
possibility of free pertechnetate, but gastric bleeding is also
a possibility. No other site of bleeding is identified.
.
Small Bowel Enteroscopy Report [**2190-9-10**]
Angioectasia in the medial aspect of the junction between the
duodenal bulb and the 2nd part of the duodenum (thermal therapy
applied); Diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum; Small
hiatal hernia; Blood in the stomach; Otherwise normal small
bowel enteroscopy to at least 2 ft beyond the ligment of Triez
probably in the distal jejunum


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is an 86 yo m w/ HOCM, CAD, and h/o UGIB,
including PUD, AVMs, colon cancer who presents with melena.
.
In ED, he was initially hemodynamically stable with Hct of 39.
His SBP subsequenlty dropped from 130 to 90, accompanied by
diaphoresis. His BP responded to 250cc NS bolus. He was noted to
have several episodes of black stool in ED which were guaic
positive. Cardiac enzymes were negative and there were no ECG
changes.  His BP dropped another time, again responsive to IVF.
In the ED he received a total of 3L IVF and was administered
Protonix IV. He was admitted to the ICU given his active GI
bleed and hypotensive episdoes.
.
##GIB-
In the ICU he received a total of 8 [**Location **], he ruled out by
cardiac enzymes x 3.  He underwent one EGD and two
enteroscopies, and one bleeding study.  On the second
enteroscopy on [**2190-9-10**] an angioectatic lesion was identified and
cauterized.  The GI bleeding study showed possible site in
region of ligament of Trietz, but none was identified on
enteroscopy. He was transferred to the floor on HD #6.  He was
discharged to home with a stable Hct x 72 hours, tolerating POs,
and decreased melena; in addition to the prevacid and carafate
he was taking at home, he was started on protonix daily.
.
##HOCM- it is possible this may have contributed to initial
hypotension in ED, as hypotension was rapidly fluid responsive.
He was hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay.
.
##HTN: anti-hypertensives and diuretics were initially held
during his ICU stay, then gradually restarted on the medical
floor.
.
##CAD: He was ruled out for MI with negative enzymes.
