Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncope vs pulseless arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83yo man with h/o lung ca s/p lobectomy, CABG ([**2168**]), DM type 2,
who presented after a pulseless arrest at [**Hospital1 778**]. He relates
that he was walking to leave the Red Sox game and the next thing
he remembers is being held done. His grandson lowered him to the
ground; he did not fall. He was pulselss for a maximum of 3
minutes. AED was applied to the patient but said no shock (did
not have rhythm). CPR was initiated and continued for 2 mintues.
Glucose was given as he is on a hypoglycemic for DM; he has sz
hx, but no sz for 30yr). After recovering from the ? pulseless
arrest with CPR, the patient vomited. He reports struggling as
staff were trying to resuscitate him. Prior to his LOC, he
denies any chest pain, palpitations, nausea, vomiting,
lightheadness, fever, chills, or vertigo. He did report some
gastrocnemius pain at baseline when he exercises more than 10
minutes and has a known diagnosis of PVOD with h/o one stent.
Upon presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient felt well, with
HR 60 SBP 120. His lactate 4.3. Heparin was initiated.
.
At baseline, the patient works out 3 times a week on various
cardio machines (treadmill, eliptical) as part of a cardiac
rehabilitation program which he began shortly after his CABG in
[**2168**]. He denies any dyspnea on exertion but notes that he has
started a new medication, ranexa, within the last month for
dyspnea. He denies orthopnea, sleeps on a stable amount of
pillows, denies PND or peripheral edema. He denies any symptoms
presyncope or recent episodes of syncope. He relates that prior
to his CABG in [**2168**], his MI associated symptoms were in fact
chest pain, shoulder pain, and arm pain, dissimilar to his
presentation currently.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING


Pertinent Results:


CXR:

The heart remains enlarged. There is no evidence of failure. The
costophrenic angles are sharp. Comparison with the prior chest
x-ray of [**5-9**] shows resolution of the interstitial edema
present at that time.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/near
akinesis of the basal and mid-inferolateral wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
 Syncope:  While the etiology of the patient's syncope was
uncertain, the most likely etiology appeared to be bradycardia.
His EKG showed LAFB and RBB which is not new per primary
cardiologist.  DUring telemetry monitoring he was noted to have
sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, and episodes of junctional
rhythms.  He was found to have an elevated digoxin level (3.1)
which was felt to have contributed to his syncopal epiosde.  He
was monitored on telmetry in the CCU and his HR improved and was
no longer significantly bradycardic as the digoxin level came
down. He had no other events on telemetry during his stay.
Nodal blocking agents were held.  EF was mildly reduced (better
than prior testing per his cardiologist).  The pt did not wish
to pursue invasive diagnostic testing (such as EP study) given
the likely diagnosis of bradycardia induced syncope.  Since the
bradycardia improved with discontinuation of the digoxin,
permanent pacemaker was not required.

.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Pt was not felt to have any evidence of
ischemia. His cardiac enzymes were flat and he never had any
ischemic changes on EKG. He was started on aspirin 81mg and
continued on his home plavix and statin.  Nodal blocking agents
were held.
.
# Pump:ECHo showed EF 45-50%; Pt was continued on his home
lasix.  Pts ace inhibitor was initially held secondary to ARF
but restarted prior to discharge.
.
#ARF-Pts baseline Cr 1.2; was 1.8 on admission but improved to
1.4 on day #2; it was ultimately fel to be related to
dehydration or bradycardia causing poor renal perfusion.   Once
his HR improved his renal function returned to baseline.
