Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest and Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
52M transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital3 **] where he presented
hypontensive to the 80's with back and chest pain.  Given his
history of a known type B aortic dissection, there was concern
for conversion to type A.  In their ED he had a non-con CT chest
they were concerned about being converted to a type A dissection
and transferred him to the [**Hospital1 **].  Prior to arrival a femoral CVL
was placed and he was given 1L NS with improvement of his
pressures to the 130's.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 **] he was tachycardic to the 120's with BPs in
the 140's with non-invasive, but once an A-line was placed they
were found to be elevated in the to as high as the 200's.
Cardiothoracic surgery was called to the bedside and asked for a
nitro-drip to be titrated to an SBP goal of 100.  Per report an
A-line pulsus was 15.  CT angigogram had to be repeated in our
ED because OSH studies were non-con.  Once type A dissection was
ruled out, and tamponade became a concern esmolol and
nitro-drips were d/c'd.  Cards was called and performed a
bedside Echo which revealed some RV diastolic collapse.  The
decision was made to bring the patient to the CCU in
anticipation of a aortogram and possible pericardiocentesis in
the cath lab.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] were called in from
home.
.
The patient was noted to have waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.
Initial concern was for CO2 retention because the patient
desaturates to 80's when falling asleep.  An ABG was checked and
revealed, a pH of 7.25 with a pCO2 of 48.

Of note the patient's WBC was elevated to 31.6.  HCT up from 40
-> 50.  Urine sent, got vanc/zosyn.
.
He is s/p discharge [**7-29**] after a bout of idiopathic
pancreatitis.  This writer spoke with the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 1131**] room
radiologist who stated that CT abdomen here revealed no s+s of
pancreatitis and lipase was 65.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECHO ([**2138**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
hyperdynamic systolic function (EF>75%). There is a mild resting
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction but no valvular [**Male First Name (un) **].
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is
likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

Based on [**2130**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic
data.

ECHO ([**2144-9-6**]):  Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function is probably
grossly preserved/normal but views are suboptimal. Cannot
exclude segmental wall motion abnormalities. The right
ventricular cavity appears small. Right ventricular free wall
systolic motion appears normal. Valvular regurgitation was not
adequately assesed except focused views obtained of the aortic
valve; focused views revealed no significant aortic
regurgitation. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There is right atrial and right ventricular
compression/collapse consistent with tamponade. Echodense
material present along the visceral surface of the pericardial
space consistent with possible fat, thrombus/fibrin or other
mass.

IMPRESSION: Probably normal LV function. No significant aortic
regurgitation. RA and RV diastolic collapse consistent with
tamponade physiology. Small to moderate pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**2144-9-6**]):  Again is seen a left pacer unit with the leads
projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle. The heart
size is enlarged. The
mediastinal contours appear widened, similar to slightly
increased from prior study. The lung volumes are low,
accentuating subtle perihilar opacities.  There is no large
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

CTA TORSO ([**2144-9-6**]):
1. As compared to the [**2144-7-26**] CT examination, there has
been interval marked proximal progression vs new thrombosed
thoracic aortic dissection, with the proximal margin at the
takeoff of the left subclavian artery, and extending
hemicircumferentially distally to the level of the diaphragm.
There is a possible stable ulceration or pseudoaneurysm at this
proximal portion.  There is also a moderate-sized
hemopericardium.

2. Unchanged chronic aneurysmal dissection of the
infradiaphragmatic/
suprarenal abdominal aorta, with the lumen predominantly
occupied by a large mural thrombus.

3. Stable bilobed infrarenal aortic aneurysm.

4. Markedly thickened left ventricular walls raises the
possibilty a
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5. Reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins suggest right sided
card
