dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypertension, diastolic CHF,
DM, and CKD who was hospitalized two weeks ago with flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of hypertension. Apparently, she
did well for a week after hospitalization and then over the past
week has developed worsening shortness of breath and weakness.
She vomited once yesterday but had no associated nausea. Today,
she presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath and
was notably dyspeneic with vitals of T 98.2, HR 85, BP 201/64,
RR 22, O2 Sat 99% on 4L NC (86% on RA). CXR revealed volume
overload and basilar density c/w more likely atelectasis less
likely PNA. She received nitro paste and nitro SL before being
put on a nitroglycerine drip. She received 60 mg IV furosemide,
180 mg Nifedipine CR, 200 mg labetalol, and was tried on CPAP
but had difficulty tolerating it. She also received IV
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for the question of pneumonia on
CXR. Of note she denied chest pain, fevers, or chills.
On arrival to the ICU the patient was notably dyspneic and
unable to speak in complete sentences. Audible gurgling.
Crackles at bases to auscultation.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unobtainable due to distress.

visible above the clavicle with patient at nearly 90 degrees
suggesting JVD
RESP: Loud crackles over both lung fields, pt unable to speak in
complete sentences
CV: RRR, S1 and S2 grossly normal (though difficult exam due to
loud breath sounds)
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, no organomegaly or masses
EXT: no C/C/E; 1+ DP and PT pulses bilaterally
SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice/no splinters

Imaging:
CXR: [**2199-10-3**]
Moderate congestive heart failure, worse in the interval. Small
bilateral pleural effusions. Opacities in both lung bases likely
represent atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded.

CXR: [**2199-10-4**]
Subtotal interval resolution of pulmonary edema and interval
improvement of right fissural pleural fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with stage V CKD, Diastolic CHF, and diabetes
mellitus type II presenting with pulmonary edema and worsening
renal function.

1. Diastolic CHF/ Pulmonary Edema: Presented with frank
pulmonary edema in the context of hypertension and perhaps
slight volume overload. Most likely inciting factor was
hypertensive urgency given high pressures at presentation but
daughters reports she has similar pressures in the morning at
home and hasn't necessarily flashed in these circumstances.
Initially required CPAP to decrease work of breathing and NTG
drip for control of hypertension.  Transitioned to oral
medications of nifedipine, labetalol, isosorbide at home doses.
Although given large doses of lasix- 60mg and then 120mg, put
out minimal urine, suggesting that chronic kidney disease may be
progressing to oliguric ESRD.  Respiratory status improved and
repeat chest x-ray showed almost complete resolution of
pulmonary edema.  Weaned successfully to 3LNC prior to transfer
to floor.

2. HTN: Hypertensive with SBP in 200s at presentation and likely
this increased afterload contributed to decreased forward flow
and her flash pulmonary edema.  As above, patient was initially
placed on a nifedipine drip with administration of home
medications of nifedipine, labetolol and isosorbide.  BP
normalized with SBP in 120s.

3. CKD: Presented with Cr of 6.1, which was worse than baseline
stage V CKD and significant electrolyte abnormalities including
nonanion gap acidosis, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. No
etiology for decompensation discovered with no urinary
eosinophils, FeNa of 1.4 and FeUrea of 39.  Urine output
remained minimal despite lasix 120mg IV.  Pt has refused HD in
past.

4. DM: Not on meds and glucose currently normal.  Check glucose
daily

5. Glaucoma: Continue drops

6. Recurrent breast cancer: Continue home anastrazole

FEN: Regular, low K diet
Access: PIV
PPx: SC heparin, no indication for GI

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 106526**],
  You were admitted to the hospital for acute shortness of
breath.  This was due to sudden onset of pulmonary edema
(accumulation of fluid in your lungs) from high blood pressure.
You were treated with oxygen and taken to the intesnive care
unit.  You were given anti-hypertensives (medications to bring
your blood pressure down).  You we
