Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness
Fast heart rate

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 31125**] is a 84F with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p
cardioversion x3 (last in [**2134**]), diastolic heart failure (EF
>55% via echo in [**2134**]) admitted to the CCU for management of
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.
.
The patient noted a gradual onset of elevation in HR over the
last 1-2 weeks when checking her daily BP and HR. Her typical
HRs were in the 60s. In the last week, her HRs increased to the
80s and her rhythm was also noted to be irregular from the
monitor read. The morning of [**2138-6-7**] her HR was found to be in
the 110s-120s which prompted presentation to the ED. During
episodes of elevated rates, she reported feelings of dizziness,
lightheadedness as well chest tightness localized to under the
left arm.
.
Her lasix dose was increased from 20mg to 40mg daily for the
last 3 days after reporting elevated BPs to cardiologists
office.
.
She denied any associated nausea, vomiting and shortness of
breath, localising symptoms or infection, subjective fevers,
chills, abdominal pain, cough and diarrhoea.
.
On presentation to the ED, the patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation and triggered for HRs in the 140s. She received
10mg IV dilt. She complained of dizziness and was found to be
hypotensive with SBPs in the 80s. She received 1L of IVF and
started on dilt ggt at a rate of 5mg/hr. EKG was consistent with
rapid atrial fibrillation with mild ST depressions in the
lateral leads. The first set of biomarkers were negative. She
received ASA 325mg. Prior to transfer, her vital signs were as
follows - HR: 129 in atrial fibrillation BP: 103/54 RR: 16
O2sat: 99% on 2L.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was without complaint. The
lightheadness, dizziness and chest discomfort had largely
resolved.
.
On review of systems, she denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denied recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for chest discomfort; but
she denied paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2138-6-9**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2138-6-7**] 2:16 PM)
The lungs are low in volume but clear. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette, hilar contours, and pleural surfaces are normal. The
aorta is unfolded with atherosclerotic calcification. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is present. A circular opacity over the
left upper lobe is likely external.
.
IMPRESSION:
No acute intrathoracic process.
.
ECHO Portable TTE (Focused views) ([**2134-7-27**] 2:56:24 PM)
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-7-14**],
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures are now higher.
There are no obvi
