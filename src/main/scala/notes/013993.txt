Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
mechanical fall
v-fib arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker generator change [**2166-9-8**]

History of Present Illness:
59 yo F with h/o severe NICM EF 15-20%, severe MR, c CAD s/p
iatrogenic MI '[**39**] from LAD dissection, CABG '[**41**] SVG to LAD, mild
2v-d in '[**63**], biV/ICD in [**6-/2162**], paroxysmal A-fib. Multiple
previous admissions for CHF. Recently, admitted for SOB
[**Date range (1) 14629**], for heart failure, recieved lasix, dobutamine, dig,
once more stable with improved volume status and hemodynamics,
the pt was transferred to [**Hospital **] rehab still on dobutamine. She
was able to return home 10 days ago. At home, the pt requires a
lot of help with adls. She has significant lower extremitity
deconditioning.
 On [**9-4**], the pt presented to OSH after mechanical fall at home.
The pt describes that shw was walking with her walker and tried
to walk backwards, which led her to lose her balance and trip
and fall and hit her head. No LOC. The pt notes some increased
LE weakness over the past 2 days.
   The pt was taken to OSH and Dig level was found to be 6. She
got 4 vials of digibind at OSH. CPR was required.
   In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], the pt noted ICD firing. The cardiology
note [**2166-8-7**] mentions episodes of firing. The pt denies that she
has felt any shocks at home over the past 10 days since she left
the rehab facility.

1. Advanced CHF with a LVEF of 15 to 20% secondary to ischemic
cardiomyopathy, on home dobutamine.  Uncertain if she wants
cardiac transplantation.

defect
7. Hypothyroidism secondary to amiodarone toxicity
8. History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation- Pt is
anticoagulated on coumadin and her INR from [**4-28**] was 3.8.
9. S/P cholecystectomy
[**70**]. S/P TIA x3 with slurred speech- This was transient and is
currently resolved.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F with h/o severe NICM EF 15-20%, severe MR, CAD s/p MI,
mild 2v-d in '[**63**], biV/ICD in 7/[**2161**]. Pt now presents with dig
toxicity and ICD shocks.
.
1. rhythym:
The pt was admitted to the Cardiac Intensive care unit, given
the history of v-fib arrest with loss of pulse and
unresponsiveness in the ambulance to the hospital.
The electrophysiology team was called to evaluate the
pacemaker/ICD and found that the device was functioning
according to its programmed parameters, sensing fast Vfib/Vtach.
 However, the ICD was unable to detect slow VT, which the pt was
experiencing in the setting of digoxin toxicity. The device was
reprogrammed to sense lower rates of VT. On [**9-8**], the pt was
taken to the EP lab for generator change since the battery was
low. This operation proceeded without complications. The
unstable rhythm occured in the setting of digoxin toxicity in
acute renal failure. Digoxin was stopped, with the plan to not
restart given the history of prior episodes of dig toxicity. The
pt was noted to have a hematoma around the device, on the day
prior to discharge. This was evaluated by the EP team, found to
be stable. Should be followed up at rehab.
.
2. CHF:
Primarily secondary to valvular dz with 4+ MR, CAD s/p MI and
CABG (SVG--> LAD), Pt was euvolemic most of the hospital stay.
After the EP lab operation, the pt was found to be volume
overloaded and diuresed with lasix over the following several
days, returned to [**Location 52753**]. Pt did not appear to tolerate ACE
or [**Last Name (un) **] well with  creatinine [**Last Name (LF) 34001**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] plan is to continue
Imdur/hydral. Pt will be continued on aldactone, Imdur/Hydral,
lasix 120 PO Bid.
.
3. CAD:
No active ischemia during the hospitalization. Pt has chronic CP
symtoms, likely not anginal. Pt had LAD dissection 20 y ago,
CABG SVG to LAD, last cath [**2163**] shows occ SVG, but otherwise
mild 2V disease. Pt will be continued on ASA, statin
.
3. Chronic back pain:
The pt's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] recommended high doses of pain
medicines, given the patient's poor overal prognosis with severe
CHF. The plan was to help provide as much comfort for the
patient as possible. The patient agreed with this plan. Pt was
started on a regimen of fentanyl patch, morphine IR, and valium.
.
4. Weakness/deconditioning: Pt will get further conditioning at
rehab.
.
5. ARF: Resolved. cr bumped to 1.6 from baseline cr. 0.7
secondary to pre-renal state.
.
5. Paroxysm a-fib: Pt was in paced rhythm during
hospitalization. The a-fib was not an acute issue. Continue
amio, was loaded with 200 [**Hospital1 **] for 2 weeks, then started 200
daily. Continue coumadin 3 mg HS, being discharged on lovenox
bridge.
.
6. hypothyroid: on levoxyl
.
7. diarrhea: resolved
