CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Reperfusion injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old
female with a history of left sided hemiparesis and right
middle cerebral artery subacute stroke.  She underwent right
carotid endarterectomy on [**2153-12-28**].  Postoperative course was
unremarkable.  She was discharged in stable condition to
home.  The patient returned to the emergency room with
increased left hemiparesis and seizure.  CT scan at an
outside hospital was done and results are unknown.  The
patient was given Ativan for her seizure disorder with
resolution of symptoms and her left sided hemiparesis is
improving.  She is now admitted for further evaluation and
treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Crohn disease.  Psoriasis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Partial colectomy.  Right carotid
endarterectomy.  Stenting of the right middle cerebral
artery.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Zoloft 50 mg q.d., baclofen,
aspirin, Percocet.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was in no acute distress
with left hemiparesis.  Vital signs were 90/64, 80, 20, 96
percent O2 sat on facial mask.  On neurologic exam cranial
nerves III-XII were intact.  The left upper extremity had
hemiparesis with strength 1/5.  The left lower extremity
hemiparesis strength was [**11-26**].  On chest exam lungs were clear
to auscultation, but diminished breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam was regular rate and
rhythm, no murmur, gallop or rub.  Abdominal exam was
unremarkable.  Extremity pulse exam showed palpable radial,
femoral pulses bilaterally 2+.  Popliteals were absent
bilaterally.  DP and PT were palpable 2+.  On the right side
she had normal strength and sensory upper and lower.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the emergency
room.  She underwent MRI of the head.  MRI demonstrated right
frontal lobe subacute infarct with suspicion of superimposed
acute infarct in the superior posterior right frontal lobe.
MRA demonstrated cervical vascular continued flow signal
throughout the carotid and vertebral arteries with
significant hemodynamic stenosis.  MRA showed the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] was limited, but demonstrated flow in the major
proximal branches of circulation.  CT demonstrated low
attenuation in right frontal lobe extending posteriorly into
the large head zone corresponding with the patient's recent
MR study.  CT of the chest was obtained to rule out pulmonary
embolism and there was no evidence of embolism.  There was a
pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate within the dependent
posterior portion of both lungs.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for continued
monitoring and care.  Admission hematocrit was 34.5, white
count 14.4.  INR was 1.1.  ABG on 100 percent was 7.31, 39,
62, -6.  Lactate was 1.7.  The stroke team followed the
patient.  The patient was continued on Dilantin.  She
received an extra dose of Dilantin after monitoring her
initial Dilantin level.  An EEG was obtained which was normal
in the awake and drowsy states.  There were no focal or
epileptiform features seen.  She was started on Zithromax for
possible atypical pneumonia.

On hospital day two there were no new events.  The patient
was transferred to the VICU for continued monitoring and
care.  The patient was begun on folate and multivitamin
tablets for elevated homocystine level.  On hospital day
three the patient was d-lined and transferred to the regular
nursing floor.  The patient was assessed by O.T. and they
felt that she didn't have any needs O.T.-wise.  Physical
therapy saw the patient and recommended continued
rehabilitation and acute rehab.

The remaining hospital course was unremarkable.  The patient
was discharged to rehab in stable condition.
