Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-12-30**] - CABGx4 (Left internal mammary->left anterior
descending artery, vein->ramus, Vein->first obtuse marginal
artery, vein->second obtuse marginal artery).
[**2127-12-26**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 42 year old male with a history of
hyperlipidemia and a family history of early CAD who presents
from an outside hospital with a history of SSCP and ETT showing
an anteroapical and inferior-lateral wall deficits.  He reports
that on [**12-10**] he was walking to the corner of his street (about
3 blocks) when he felt like "someone hit my chest with a sledge
hammer."  He felt [**8-25**] burning/pulling SSCP that radiated down
his left arm and up his neck causing his neck to feel "on fire."
 His left arm also felt numb.  He reports feeling SOB, dizzy,
lightheaded, and diaphoretic.  He denies nausea/vomiting.
Because of these symptoms, the patient returned home and rested,
and his chest pain lasted for several hours and then decreased
to 0/10.  The patient reports that since the summer he has had
decreased exercise tolerance and increased fatigue with
exertion.  He can normally walk 15-20 miles each day.  He says
that all his life he has had angina which he describes as both a
burning sensation and tightness in his chest that usually
ressolves with palpation.  His most recent angina was 4 weeks
prior to this episode, and he usually has this once every 2
months.  He reports he has this once every 2 months.  He reports
eating a poor diet with many fried foods.  He did not take an
ASA for the 7 days PTA.
.
On [**12-15**], the patient presented to his PCP with complaints of
nasal congestion and subjective fever, and he also mentioned
this episode of chest pain.  He was prescribed a Z-pack for
sinusitis.  An EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V6.  Since this
was a change from his previous EKGs, he was referred for a
thallium stress test.  The stress test was done on [**12-24**], which
showed a fixed anterior apical wall infarct, a reversible
inferior lateral wall defect, akinesis of the apex, and EF of
30%.  He was notified of these results, seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**12-25**],
and referred to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital.
.
He was admitted on [**12-25**] to [**Hospital3 1443**]. CEs: Trop T 0.09
-> 0.10 -> 0.08, CK 77 -> 75 -> 73, CKMB 3 -> 2. proBNP 1585.
Chol 282, TG 191, HDL 29, LDL 215.  TTE showed EF 30%. He was
started on ASA 325 daily, Plavix 600 mg PO x1, Plavix 75 PO
daily, Lopressor 25 mg PO bid, and Zocor 80 mg PO daily.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was given Plavix 600 mg x1, ASA 325 mg x1,
Lopressor 25 mg x1, Zocor 80 mg x1. Cardiac catheterization
showed
.
He reports his last chest pain was on [**12-10**].
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.  He does
report recent fever in relation to his URI.  He reports that he
gets the taste of iron in his mouth on occasion.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain and orthopnea. He does report increased dyspnea and fatigue
on exertion since the summer.  He reports occasional ankle
edema, occasional PND (wakes up feeling like he is "choking"),
occasional palpitations, and the feeling of
dizziness/lightheadedness when going from sitting to standing.

Social History:
Social history is significant for current tobacco use.  He has

hand smoke, as other members of his family smoke in the house.

drinks alcohol. No history of other drug use.  He is disabled

.
EKG [**2127-12-25**] at OSH: Sinus rhythm at a rate of 65. Q waves in
V3-V6, ST segment elevations in V2-V3, T wave inversions in
V2-V6.
.
EKG ([**12-26**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 69. Q waves in leads V2-V6
with deep biphasic T waves in leads V2-V6 suggest anterior wall
myocardial infarction, probably acute or subacute. Low QRS
voltage in the limb leads.
.
ETT performed on [**2127-12-24**] demonstrated (OSH): 42 year old male
exercised on standard [**Doctor First Name **] protocol with Myoview for 4 minutes
and 30 seconds. Maximum heart rate achieved was 152 or 85%
predicted maximum. Maximum systolic blood pressure was 120/70.
The baseline EKG reveals normla sinus rhythm with nondiagnostic
inferior Q waves and probable age indeterminate anterior
mycardial infarct pattern. With exercise: the patient noted
fatigue and mild lightheadedness. There was a mild nondiagnostic
ST segment elevation superimposed upon the baselin changes in
the septal precordial leads. Pre and post exercise Myoview
cardiac SPECT imaging was obtained and reviewed.
CONCLUSION:
1. Nondiagnostic stress test for ischemia based on EKG criteria.
2. Review of the post stress and rest myocardiac SPECT images
demonstarte a large in size, sever in degree fixed anterior
apical wall infarct. There is a large in size, severe in degree
reversible inferior lateral wall defect. There is akinesis of
the apex. EF equals 30%.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2127-12-26**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system

revealed severe two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had mild non flow limiting disease.  The LAD was totally
occluded after a small first diagonal.  The mid and distal LAD
as well as D2 filled via left to left and right to left
collaterals.  The Ramus had a 70%
proximal stenosis.  The LCx was totally occluded proximally.
The RCA
was a dominant vessel with a 30% stenosis in the mid segment.
2.  Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 34%
and
severe anterior/apical hypokinesis.  There was apical akinesis.
There
was no mitral regurgitation.
