Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and peripheral edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66000**] is an 84 year old male with PMH of CAD and
biventricular congestive heart failure who presented to his PCP
with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chief complaint of increasing edema and fatigue. The
patient was admitted to [**Location (un) **] and found to have a HR up to
120; he received IV lopressor with a drop in his blood pressure.
Echocardiogram demonstrated EF 10% (down from prior 20-25%) as
well as a thickened septum thought to be consistent with
amyloid. He was placed on renally-dosed dopamine and BP meds
were held. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] evaluated the patient on [**7-7**] and on
interrogation of his AICD found him to be in atrial tachycardia
at a rate 130. He was placed on IV heparin for atrial
fibrillation. Dopamine was continued but as his blood pressures
improved, he was started back on a beta blocker and aldactone.
The decision was made for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
treatment.

At the time of transfer, the patient was still on dopamine at a
rate of 7.5. He stated that his breathing is "not too good," but
only woke up briefly to relate this. He denied chest pain.

ROS: Endorses urinary frequency. Not able to obtain other ROS
due to mental status.

EKG demonstrated an atrial rate of ~ 100, ventricular rate 70.
At times appeared V paced but not consistently. No ST/T wave
changes.

Cardiac studies:
Cardiac cath [**3-/2125**]:
Right dominant system. Two vessel CAD - 60% lesion in distal
portion of the RPDA. LCx 90% distal stenosis. Elevated right and
left pressures (RVEDP = 24 mm Hg; PCWP mean = 32 mm Hg). Severe
pulmonary HTN.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
.
Echo: EF 25-30%.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal with severe global hypokinesis and inferior wall
akinesis. Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with

trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Prominent symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with global and regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel
CAD or other diffuse process. Right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. Dilated aortic root.


Social History:
The patient lives in [**Hospital3 **] with his daughter and
son-in-law who are essentially his 24 hour/day caregivers.
Retired. [**Name2 (NI) **] previously smoked but quit several years ago. He
does not drink alcohol.

Family History:
Not obtainable from patient.

IMAGING:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**7-7**] at [**Location (un) **] demonstrated (by
report):  LV not dilated; moderate biatrial enlargement. Marked
septal thickening (2.2). LV walls considerably more thickened
compared to [**2125-3-7**]. Elevated CVP 20 mmHg. Elevated PA
systolic pressure (50 mmHg). EF ~ 10%. RV is dilated. Septal
flattening consistent with volume overload. No significant
valvular disease. Does have restrictive mitral inflow pattern.

TTE performed on [**7-8**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The
right atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is >20 mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to
akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls and severe
hypokinesis of the inferior septum and lateral wall. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No right atrial or
right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. The mitral inflow
is consistent with a restrictive filling pattern, a marker of
severe diastolic and/or systolic dysfunction. Compared with the
findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-3-26**],
the left ventricular ejection fraction is further depressed;
right ventricular contractile function is now severely
depressed.

R upper extremity ultrasound performed on [**7-7**] at [**Location (un) **] was
negative for DVT

R upper extremity ultrasound on [**7-11**] demonstrated: No evidence of
DVT in the right upper extremity.

KUB on [**7-7**] at [**Location (un) **]: large amount of stool, mildly dilated
small bowel loops which are nonspecific and probably due to
ileus

CXR (from [**Location (un) **], [**7-7**]): limited study with possible tiny
pleural effusions or pleural thickening
CXR [**7-8**] demonstrated: The heart is enlarged. Considerable
tortuosity of the aorta is present. The position of the multiple
pacemaker leads is unchanged since the prior chest x-
