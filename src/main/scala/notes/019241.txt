ADMISSION LABS ON [**2188-7-18**]:  White blood cells 11.3, hemoglobin
12.4, hematocrit 38.4, platelets 436,000.  PT 13.1, PTT 33.6,
INR is 1.2.  Sodium is 139.  Potassium is 5.1.  BUN is 26,
creatinine 1.7.  Glucose is 101.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray on [**2188-7-18**] shows no acute pulmonary
disease.  Status post previous coronary artery bypass graft.
Multiple gallstones seen.  Electrocardiogram on [**2188-7-18**] shows
a sinus rhythm with a rate of 61.  Borderline
electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2188-7-22**] following an uneventful right axillo to right common
femoral artery with a jump graft to the anterior tibial
artery, and heel debridement of both heels.  At the end of
surgery, the patient had a warm right foot with a dopplerable
dorsalis pedis pulse and a dopplerable graft pulse.

On [**2188-7-24**], the patient underwent uneventful left common
femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft with PTFE.  At the
end of surgery, he had a warm left foot with a palpable
dorsalis pedis pulse.  The patient's foot cultures grew
pseudomonas of two types and several strains of gram negative
rods, as well as diphtheroids.  Postoperatively, the patient
was covered with Kefzol and ciprofloxacin.

Anticoagulation with Coumadin was started for his bypass
graft.  The patient was kept on intravenous heparin until his
INR reached 2.0 after receiving 2.5 mg of Coumadin.
Subsequent INR on [**2188-7-27**] was noted to be 9.9.  The patient
was treated with 2 units of fresh frozen plasma the same day
and the following day required vitamin K as well as 2 more
units of fresh frozen plasma.  INR came down to 1.8.
Diuresis with intravenous Lasix was continued.  Coumadin dose
was decreased to 1 mg po qd.  Imminent discharge to
rehabilitation facility was planned.

On [**2188-7-30**], the patient complained of shortness of breath,
was tachypneic and tachycardic.  Chest x-ray showed pulmonary
edema.  The patient required intubation and was transferred
to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Cardiac isoenzymes were
negative, but troponin was positive at 38.

The patient was extubated on [**2188-8-1**].  He underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed all three saphenous vein grafts
were occluded.  His left internal mammary artery to LAD was
patent and supplied the entire cardiac circulation via
collaterals.

The patient developed some temperature spikes and was
cultured.  A catheter tip showed greater than 15 yeast
colonies.  The patient was started on a seven day course of
oral Diflucan.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were
negative.  A sputum culture could not be obtained.  The
patient was transferred to the vascular intermediate care
unit.

On [**2188-8-9**], the patient was transferred to floor status.  His
appetite was still somewhat poor.  His NPH insulin was held.
He was covered with a regular insulin sliding scale.
Physical therapy evaluated the patient for full weight
bearing ambulation.

At the time of dictation, the patient's right chest,
bilateral groin and bilateral lower anterior leg incisions
were clean, dry and intact.  The patient had palpable
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  The posterior tibial
pulses were dopplerable.  The patient's surgical staples will
all be removed prior to transfer to rehabilitation.  The
patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in the [**Location (un) 5028**]
office in approximately one month.

The patient should continue to have normal saline wet to dry
dressings to his Achilles ulcers [**Hospital1 **].  He should continue on
ciprofloxacin until he is reevaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].
