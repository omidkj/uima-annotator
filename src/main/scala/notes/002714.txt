Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2160-7-10**]: Aortic valve replacement with 19 mm tissue and
Coronary Artery bypass graft x 1 (RSVG->RCA)


History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with known aortic valve disease which has
been followed by serial echocardiograms. Her most recent
echocardiogram showed severe aortic stenosis, moderate aortic
insufficiency and mild mitral regurgitation. She
is quite symptomatic with severe dyspnea on exertion. She has
also had an two admissions for heart failure in the past few
months and for the past two months she has been at rehab. Given
the severity of her disease, she has been referred for tissue
AVR/CABG.

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram [**2160-7-10**]
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.6cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The posterior leaflet is calcified and immobilized.
Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. There is a bioprosthesis in the
aortic position. It appears well seated. The ;leaflets can not
be definitively seen. There is trace valvualr and trace
paravalvular aortic regurgitation seen. At a cardiac output of
4.5 liters/minute, the maximum gradient through the valve was 35
mmHg with a mean of 17 mmHg at an effective area of 1.4 cm2. The
mitral regurgitation is improved and is now mild. The tricuspid
regurgitation is also improved, now mild. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2160-7-10**] where
the patient underwent Aortic valve replacement ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17167**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**])
and coronary artery bypass graft (SVG-distal RCA).   Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  She extubated POD1. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  The patient was transferred
to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.

Respiratory: Aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and ambulation
her oxygenation improved. Inhalers were continued.

Cardiac: hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm.  SBP 130-140's
low-dose Lisinopril was started.  Statin restarted.

GI: history of constipation. Her previous laxatives were
resumed.

Renal; gently diuresed toward her preop weight- contiues to
require diuresis.  Baseline CRE 1.7-2.0.  Electrolytes were
repleted as needed.

Endocrine: Insulin sliding scale to maintain BS < 150.
Colchicine was restarted for her history of gout.

Skin: She was followed by the wound care service for a
longstanding stage 4 pressure ulcer following pilonidal cyst
measuring 2 x1 cm with minimal depth. Some undermining. Peri
wound tissue is macerated with copious serous drainage.  They
recommended pressure ulcer guidelines and dressing changes.

Neuro: Antidepressant was restarted.  Valium held secondary to
lethargy. once mental status returned to baseline her Oxycodone
for standing back pain was resumed and toelrated well.  Nicotine
patch applied.

Disposition: She was followed by physical therapy.  She was
returned to [**Hospital 392**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92342**]
on POD# 5.
