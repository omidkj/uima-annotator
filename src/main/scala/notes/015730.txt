Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**8-9**] with IABP placement

History of Present Illness:
88 y/o Male w/ PMH of CAD status post CABG and MI in the past,
DM2, hypertension, diabetes, afib, chronic kidney disease,
status post nephrectomy recently admitted to [**Location (un) 620**] for CHF,
has known severe AS (EF 25-35%) presents with gradual worsening
DOE over the last month. There has been no acute change but
patient states no longer can lay flight at night which is a
change in the last two weeks. Denies cough. Afebrile. No Chest
pain. States quality of life has significantly diminished,
unable to do many activities that he used to. Cardiology at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) **] spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and decided to admit to heart
failure service for evaluation of possible CORE valve. During
his last admission, it was recommended that he undergo
consideration ?AVR or CORE valve. Of note, at [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**], he
was given diuretics and improved. But given his worsening
symptoms, he would like evaluation for aforementioned
procedures. He has had trop bump to 0.234 which is similar to
prior. Down to 0.2 at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2118-8-5**]. OF NOTE, on [**2118-7-23**] (s/p
fall w/ rib fractures), he elevated his Trops to 0.66 at [**Hospital1 18**]
[**Location (un) 620**] as well as CKMB to 9.70 and thus may have had an NSTEMI
on [**2118-7-23**] with down trending Troponins thus on Discharge they
were 0.234 however CKMB [**7-21**] 4>10>6>6 on [**7-21**]/18/19/30
which may have indicated a small reinfarction. However, this is
unclear from [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) 620**] documentation.
.
Of note patient states he is DNR/DNI, but has no documentation
at this time. Transfered from [**Location (un) 620**] with hx of chronic chf,
and aortic stenosis. Worsening sob, no fevers. Had chf flare
yesterday given lasix and sent back to nsgn home. Trop 0.234
similiar to prior. Pale sob with talking. Pt states he is dnr
but no paperwork to reflect that.
Labs at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] (performed at 1430):
CBC: WBC 7.3, hgb 9.7, plt 415
Trop: 0.234
BNP: [**Numeric Identifier **]
Radiology at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **]: CXR (in our pacs system)- CHF
CLINICAL HISTORY: Shortness of breath. Comparison is made with
prior studies [**8-4**] and [**7-23**]. Right upper lobe opacity
is unchanged consistent with pneumonia. Moderate to large right
and moderate left pleural effusions with associated atelectasis
are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of
the patient. Mild cardiomegaly and tortuous aorta are stable.
The lungs are hyperinflated consistent with COPD. Sternal wires
are aligned. Patient is status-post CABG.
IMPRESSION: RIGHT UPPER LOBE PNEUMONIA. BILATERAL PLEURAL
EFFUSIONS WITH ADJACENT ATELECTASIS. COPD.
AT [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] ED:
EKG here: sinus arrhythmia at 73, LAD, RBBB, QTc 474
On exam: comfortable on 2L NC with RR 20, 94% sat. crackles at
the bases R>L. RRR w/2/6 systolic ejection murmur at RUSB. no
elevation in JVD. no LE edema. rest of exam benign.

ECHO (TTE) [**2118-8-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with
akinesis of the distal [**12-7**] of the left ventricle and hypokinesis
in the remaining segments. There is some regional variation,
with preservation in function of the basal lateral and basal
anteroseptal walls. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be
excluded. The remaining left ventricular segments are
hypokinetic. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Severe aortic stenosis (based on [**Location (un) 109**]; low gradient) is present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Low-gradient aortic
stenosis with calculated aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2 but mean
gradient of 14 mm Hg; low gradient may be due to severe left
ventricular contractile dysfunction. Depressed cardiac index.
Mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-9-14**],
calculated aortic valve area is lower. Left ventricular systolic
function is less vigorous. The severity of mitral regurgitation
has increased.

CATH [**2118-8-9**]:
The resting hemodynamics showed a CO = 2.7 L/min; mean gradient
18.6 mmHg; HR 77; stroke volume 35 cc; SVI = 21.8 cc; [**Location (un) 109**] 0.62
cm2.
After 10 minutes of dobutamine, 20 mcg/kg/min, the CO 3.5 L/min;
mean gradient 22.3 mmHg; HR 79; stroke volume 43.6 cc; SVI =
27.1 cc; [**Location (un) 109**] 0.73 cm2.

Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA:    80% calcified
LAD:       100% calcified ostial occlusion
LCX:       100% OMB1 and OMB2.  Small branches without perfusion
RCA:       40% in the mid RCA.  There was diffuse disease in the
PDA and posterolateral branches up to 40-50% stenoses
SVG-OMB:   Occluded by prior examination
LIMA-LAD:     Patent LIMA to the LAD with diffuse disease of the
mid and distal LAD and diagonal branches
.
Interventional details
After dobutamine 20 mcg/kg/min, the patient developed profound
hypotension to 70-80s systolic that was treated with dopamine 10
mg/kg/min and neosynephrine 1-2 mcg/min.  This resulted in a
systolic BP of approximately 90-100 mmHg.
An IABP was placed from the right femoral artery without
complications and resulted in an augmentation of the BP to 130
systolic.
Coronary arteriography was performed from the left femoral
artery
.
Assessment & Recommendations
1.	Three Vessel coronary artery disease
2.	Patent LIMA to the LAD; Occluded SVG to the OMB
3.	Severe aortic stenosis with borderline contractile reserve
4.	Hypotension after dobut
