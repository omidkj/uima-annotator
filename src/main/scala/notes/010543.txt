Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and cellulitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
HPI-53 yo male with a hx of DMII, HTN, Pos ppd with calcified
lung nodules, laryngeal CA s/p total laryengectomy and XRT with
recurrence now presenting with productive cough and SOB and
bilateral arm cellulitis.  He has initially completed initial
XRT in [**11-13**] with recurrence of laryngeal CA in [**2-14**] requiring
total laryngectomy on [**2159-3-13**] followed by XRT which he is
currently undergoing 5 weeks of with 10 treamentments left and
last treatment 1 week PTA. Since his last treatment he has
reported worsening DOE as well as productive cough. He also
reported dysphagia often regurgitating food.  He also noted
increasing pain, erythema nd swelling of bilateral hands, with
no known trauma or injury that he is aware of.
*
In the ED he was hypoxic to and trach was placed in his stoma
and he was started on PS ventilation. He was given nebs and was
started on levo/flagyl along with morphine for throat pain.
*
Durimg his MICU course, the patient remained ventilated via
tracheostomy, treated with vanc/levo/flagyl for pna and
anticoagulated and beta-blocked for NSTEMI in setting of
tachycardia during presentation.  In this setting pt developed
hemoptysis which was evaluated by ENT and was attributed to
anticoagulation and friable mucose after recent trach placement
and with hx of treatment for laryngeal ca.  Eventually had
urgent flexible bronch and trach by pulmonary with no fistula,
active bleeding, only friable mucosa.  He had no further
bleeding and CT head/neck confirmed that there was no
tracheo-inominate artery fistula present. He has been extubated
since [**6-3**] without complication.  He had been on pca while his
oxycontin for his chornic throat pain was being held which has
been slowly weaned off.  On admission he was also noted to have
bilateral arm cellulitis for which he is being continued on vanc
and followed by plastics.  Flagyl was also d/c'd as not felt to
be an aspiration pna.  He was also evaluated by Speech/Swallow
who reccommended pureed foods and liquids as he does have
changes in is esophagus secondary to his radiation therapy.
*
Currently he feels better, breathing is good, although he still
coughs and brings up sputum via his trach stoma.  He still has
pain of his wrists, but notes that the erythema is improving
with treatment as his flexibility and movement are improving as
well.

CT CHEST/NECK: 1) No tracheoinnominate fistula. 2) Bilateral,
multifocal airspace opacities. This correlates with findings on
recent chest radiographs.
*
ECHO:  1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Anterior, distal septal, apical, distal lateral and distal
inferior hypokinesis is present.  2. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.  4. There is a trivial pericardial
effusion.
*
Cardiac CATH:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Septic physiology
*
RUE Ultrasound: 1.3 cm superficial amorphous soft tissue density
overlying the right antecubital fossa, which given its acute
onset and apparent bruising from direct visualization, is most
likely consistent with an organizing hematoma. This lesion is
distinct from the underlying venous structures, and there is no
evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo male with a hx of DM, HTN, laryngeal CA s/p XRT with
recurrence now presenting with productive cough and SOB,
cellulitis bilateral hands and NSTEMI.

1) PNA - initially ventilated for 1 day for likely CAP, but
covered broadly with levo, vanc and flagyl, but as less risk and
concern for aspiration flagyl was discharged.  As sputum
polymicrobial, but with MSSA, vanc was changed to oxacillin.  He
continued to clinically improve and did not require further
ventilation except while laying flat for cardiac cath, was
temporarily re-trached and ventilated for a few hours.  He did
have some hemoptysis which was attributed to friable mucosa as
the rest of the work up was negative and continued supportive
suctioning and trach stoma care.  He did not have any further
hemoptysis although unlikely off anticoagulation and with
negative work up for fistula. By day of discharge he was sating
94% on RA and up to 97%on 35% O2 via tracheal mask.

2)Cellulitis: unclear source of cellulitis of bilateral hands,
with no history of trauma or injury, but was covered with vanc
innitially and with no growth on blood cultures and only MSSA on
sputum culture he was transitioned to oxacillin on which his
erythema improved dramatically.  Plastics drained an area on
skin with no growth on cultures.  Plain films of hand were
negative except for soft tissue swelling as expected. He will
have to complete 2weeks of IV antibiotics, which will be
complete on [**6-15**] as long as erythema has improved.  He should
continue to elevate hands and ROM exercises.

3)CHF: new diagnosis of heart failure after NSTEMI likley on
setting of sepsis and with elevated right heart pressures on
cardiac cath and EF down to 35% with almost global hypokinesis.
He was started on beta-blockers, ace inhibitor, with some mild
diuresis with lasix periodically, but as is very volume
overloaded he will require continued diuresis at rehab.

4)NSTEMI: in setting of demand from possible sepsis and
infection.  He came in with mildly elevated troponins, but flat
CKs, and significant evolving anterior EKG changes.  He was
initially started on heparin for ACS, but started bleeding as
above, that resolved off anticoagulation.  Cardiology followed
along and eventually reccommended cardiac catheterization which
showed clean coronaries and no blockages.  He was continued on
asprin, statin and beta-blocker.

5)Pain control: patient has had chronic pain from laryngeal ca
which is followed by pain clinic, previously on oxycontin and
prn dilaudid and was managed with PCA while in MICU.  Then
changed to methadone which can be dissolved or in liquid form as
he has had difficulty swallowing and bridges with dilaudid PCA
and then transitione
