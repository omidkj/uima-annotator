to the 80s. His ECG showed question of anterior ST elevations of
1mm. Trop-T 0.058 then <0.03. He was given lovenox and aspirin.
Cards consult called and considered for cath, but then
determined that his ECG elevations were consistent with prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M with HTN and CAD, found down at Salvation Army in
[**Hospital1 1559**], admitted with hypotension and bradycardia.

# Hypotension:  Lactate of 2.9 at OSH, resolved to 0.9 on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. Blood pressure also resolved to the 110s.
Received 6L of IV fluid in the ED at St Vincents, with blood
pressure of 111/48 prior to transfer. Most likely due to
hypovolemia from poor PO intake and alcohol abuse exacerbated by
slow rate.  Patient was asymptomatic while in the ICU with
pressures in the 130s/80s at time of transfer to the floor. His
amlodipine, clonidine, and atenolol were discontinued given pt
with low-normal BP. Cardiology was also consulted who did not
favor use of nodal agents or clonidine with cocaine use.
.
# Orthostatic Hypotension:  Prior to discharge patient noted to
have orthostatic hypotension that persisted somewhat despite
hydration.  Possibly due to clonidine taken during overdose or
bioaccumulated.  This improved at time of discharge. Pt was
evaluated by physical therapy who provided pt with a walker. In
addition, nodal agents/clonidine discontinued. Pt instructed on
how to arise with orthostatic hypotension. Pt encouraged to stay
hydrated.
.
# Bradycardia: Unclear etiology. Reportedly occurred before
about 2 weeks ago with a similar stay in the hospital.
Differential includes conduction disease/ sick sinus syndrome,
medication abuse, drug abuse, vagal response. Cardiology
evaluated patient and felt most likely toxic effect due to
substances in the context of resting low heart rate.  All
anti-hypertensives were held on presentation and cardiology
recommended continuing to hold atenolol and clonidine.  They
felt despite history of CAD given resting slow rate benefit of
this [**Doctor Last Name 360**] questionable and danger if actively using cocaine was
not insignificant.  Pt is not a candidate for PPM at this time.
By the time of transfer to floor patient's rate was in high 50's
and never dropped lower again.  Patient should follow with
cardiologist for history of CAD and bradycardia.  Pt was
encouraged to speak to his PCP regarding cardiology referral.

# Rhabdomyolysis: Pt had an elevated CK at presentation likely
due to having been down and mild rhabdo.  He never had renal
failure.  Resolved by time of discharge. PT instructed he may
resume statin on [**2-25**].

# Alcohol Abuse/Cocaine abuse: Last drink at 8am day of
admission. Patient was on CIWA initially but never had any signs
of withdrawal.  Pt was evaluated by social work during admission
to provide pt with resources for addiction. Pt expressed that he
was not suicidal and was motivated to stop drinking ETOH and
using drugs.

# CAD: Patient with EKG changes at presentation to OSH and
intermittently complaining of chest pressure but troponin flat
and review showed these were chronic changes.  He was continued
on his aspirin.  Statin held given elevated CK but should
restart in one week. BB stopped given low HR and BP and danger
of use with active cocaine.
.
Transitional:
-Patient will need f/u with PCP to discuss establishing
cardiology follow up. Unable to make follow up appointment given
the office was closed today.
-HCTZ, atenolol, clonidine all were stopped
-statin was held, ok to resume [**2-25**]
