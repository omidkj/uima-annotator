History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67877**] is a 63 y/o woman who has not seen a physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 30
years, who reports that she quit smoking 2 months ago and since
has had DOE (40 pack year history).  She went to see her PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 36037**], on [**2183-4-21**].  She was found to be tachycardic to
140s, blood tests showing Ddimer of 2.2 and sent to ED at
[**Hospital3 1443**] Hospital for concern over possible PE.  An EKG
from the office was not provided (unclear if sinus tachy).  She
states that since she quit smoking she noted intermittent DOE,
but not progressively worsening, rather staying the same over
the past 2 months.  No chest pain, palpitations, arm pain, or
jaw pain.  No nausea, diaphoresis.  She reports that some days
she can climb a flight of stairs without difficulty and other
days, she becomes winded at the top of the stairs.  No PND or
orthopnea.  No peripheral edema or weight gain.  No
dizziness/lightheadedness.  No cough.
Rest of ROS is negative.
.
In the ED at LMH, her BP was 168/81 with P: 105, satting 97% RA.
 EKG at OSH showed sinus tachy at 102 bpm, LAE, no ST-T changes.
 Chest CT was negative for PE.  Non-specific mediatstinal and
hilar nodes for which follow-up is recommended, and
emphysematous changes noted.  No pulm nodules, infiltrates,
masses, or effusion.  Troponin 0.01 BNP 4942, nl CBC, chem 10.
CXR [**4-22**] showed cardiomegaly with clr lungs.  All 3 sets of CE
were neg for MI.  Echo showing mild septal and mild inferior
wall HK with EF of 45-50%.  She had a probable bicuspid aortic
valve with a calculated aortic valve area of 0.8cm.  Peak
gradient was in the range of 40 with a mean of 26.  Mild AR.
2=3+ mod to moderately severe mitral regurg.  Creainine at OSH
was 1.2.  WBC was 10.8.  Hct 39.4. INR 1.2. Ddimer: 2.2.
.
Pre cath- was given ASA 325, Atenolol 25mg po, Plavix 75mg X 1,
Captopril 12.5mg X 1, lasix 20mg po, digoxin 0.125mg and valium
5mg.
She feels fine.  No complaints pre-cath.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
OSH ECHO [**2183-4-22**]
Mild septal and mild inferior wall HK, EF 45-50%.  Probable
bicuspid aortic valve with calculated aortic valve area of
0.8cm, peak 40, mean 26.  Assoc mild aortic insufficiency.  [**1-3**]+
mod to mod severe mitral regurgitation.
.
CT thorax with contrast [**2183-4-22**]
Obstructive changes on the lung.  Numerous lymph nodes.  Small
nodule on the right lung adjacent to the pleura, most likely
inflammatory.  Numerous hilar lymph nodes  that are present in
the peri-aortic and right paratracheal, precarinal and
subcarinal area.  There was a 50mm diameter node in the azygos
region.
.
Adenosine Myoview stress test revealed no evidence of proximal
ischemia.  Global left ventricular HK.  EF was 46%.

Also consider pulm lymph node biopsy (nonspecific adenopathy on
CT scan at LMH).

[**2183-4-29**] ECHO
PRE-CPB: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
A small
secundum atrial septal defect is present. There is mild
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. No left ventricular aneurysm is seen. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal except for inferior
hypokineis.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed at 40%.. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic root. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve is functionally bicuspid with fusion of the LCC and RCC.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation
is seen with a central jet. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. There is an enlarged mitral
annulus of 3.4-3.5 cm. There is no systolic anterior motion of
the mitral
valve leaflets. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen with
elevation of the systolic blood pressure to 150 systolic using
phenylephrine. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-CPB: On inotropic support (dobutamine, norepinephrine)
there is
preservation of the LV systolic function. LVEF now 40%. The RV
systolic
function is hyperdynamic on inotropic support. There is a
well-seated tissue valve in the aortic position with trivial
regurgitation, no paravalvular leak and trivial aortic valve
gradient. The ascending aorta is intact. There is no [**Male First Name (un) **]. There
is a well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position with
1+ MR, which is improved from pre-CPB. There is mild TR, trivial
PI. A small ASD remains.
