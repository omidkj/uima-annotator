Admission Date:  [**2200-1-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2200-1-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2137-3-18**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old male who
presented to outside hospital after shoveling snow a few day
prior to admission when he developed intermittent chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and lightheadedness.

He described the pain as [**9-5**].  It was initially constant
but then subsided and became intermittent on the day of
admission.  He was driving and became very lightheaded.  He
then went to [**Hospital3 3583**] and was found to have a systolic
blood pressure of 69.  He was also found to be in atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate in the 130s.  He also was
noted to have 2-mm to 3-mm ST elevations in leads V2 to V6
and large Q waves.

His pressure responded to intravenous hydration.  He was also
started on a low-dose esmolol drip for rate control, also on
heparin and Aggrastat.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for catheterization which revealed a totally occluded
proximal to medial left anterior descending artery with no
collaterals.  The left main was free of disease.  The right
coronary artery was with medial 50% stenosis and normal
diastolic ventricular function.

When the patient was initially hypotensive when arriving to
the laboratory.  The esmolol drip was discontinued.  His
blood pressure remained in the low 100s systolically, but
later he required dopamine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  No medications on admission.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history significant for father who
died of a myocardial infarction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history is positive for tobacco of
one pack per day for 50 years.  Positive for alcohol of
approximately a few beers per week.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General physical
examination revealed the patient was pleasant, in no apparent
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles were intact.  Mucous membranes were dry.
Heart examination revealed irregularly irregular,
tachycardic.  The lungs were clear.  The abdomen was benign.
Extremity examination revealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Hematocrit was
38.6 and platelets were 190.  Potassium was 4.1.  Creatinine
was 1.9.  Creatine kinase was 917, MB was 33, and MB index
was 3.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 62-year-old gentleman with
anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, now with atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate.

He was initiated on aspirin, Plavix, and started on statin;
at which time his liver function tests were sent to monitor
baseline.  He was also initiated on a beta blocker.  An ACE
inhibitor was held while he was hypotensive.  He was
continued on Aggrastat for 18 hours.  He was kept
intra-aortic balloon pump to maintain his blood pressure and
to optimize perfusion.  He was also on a dopamine drip which
was maintained for a goal mean arterial pressure of greater
than 65.  He was also monitored for strict ins-and-outs and
daily weights.

Since the patient was found in atrial fibrillation (it was
unclear of the onset), he was continued on heparin and
Coumadin once the intra-aortic balloon pump was pulled before
cardioversion.  A beta blocker was used for rate control.

The patient was full code.

The intra-aortic balloon pump was pulled on [**1-18**]
without difficulties.

The patient had a bedside echocardiogram on [**1-19**] with
a preliminary report of left ventricular ejection fraction of
approximately 30% with global hypokinesis with more severe
hypokinesis anteriorly.  There was no pericardial effusion
noted.

The patient was scheduled for a transesophageal
echocardiogram on [**1-20**] in order to evaluate for clot
prior to direct current cardioversion for the atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate.  By this point,
the patient was off dopamine and been initiated on a low-dose
ACE inhibitor.

The transesophageal echocardiogram did not demonstrate any
clot.  The patient was started on Coumadin, and the heparin
was continued.  The patient received cardioversion on
[**1-21**] with 200 joules with conversion to a sinus
rhythm.  The patient was loaded on amiodarone; given 800 mg
p.o. b.i.d. times one week followed by 200 mg p.o. q.d. for
atrial fibrillation.  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix,
beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor.

He was then scheduled for risk stratification examination.
The patient also received a Physical Therapy consultation.
The patient had a signal average electrocardiogram as the
first part of his risk stratification which was borderline
positive.  At this point, the patient was stable, and called
out to the floor, and maintained on telemetry.

While on the floor, his course was complicated by an episode
of dyspnea with respiratory rates in the upper 20s to 30s.  A
chest x-ray demonstrated a right lower lobe infiltrate.  The
patient was initiated on Levaquin and Flagyl p.o. for
presumptive aspiration pneumonia therapy.  The patient
responded well and was continued on Levaquin and Flagyl.

In addition, due to some evidence of congestive heart failure
based on the ejection fraction of approximately 25% to 30%,
the patient was diuresed with Lasix 20 mg intravenously times
one with a good response.  He was also given Atrovent
nebulizers q.6h. for the dyspnea and wheeze.

The patient continued to be cared for in house while awaiting
for a therapeutic INR of between 2 to 3 for atrial
fibrillation as well as monitoring oxygen saturations.  The
patient did not require oxygen on admission and was not to go
home with oxygen.

The patient's INR became therapeutic on [**1-25**].  In
addition, his ambulatory oxygen saturations on room air
remained greater than 95% to 96%.  The patient was ambulating
without difficulty and was cleared by Physical Therapy for
discharge.  The patient was discharged to home.
