Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-4-27**] 1. Aortic valve replacement 23 mm Biocor Epic tissue
valve. 2. Tricuspid valve repair with a 30 mm [**Company 1543**] Contour

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38828**] is an 81 year old man with past medical history of
hepatitis C Virus genotype 2 with stage II liver fibrosis
(biopsy [**2177**]) secondary to a blood transfusion in [**2158**]. He
received blood transfusion after partial gastrectomy which was
secondary to a benign gastric tumor. He has never been on
treatment for his liver disease. In addition, he also has
history of aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension
and gout.  He is not on anticoagulation for his atrial
fibrillation. Over the past one year, he has developed
progressive shortness of breath that is now limiting his
activity climbing one flight of stairs and walking to his car.
He does not complain of chest pain or lightheadedness. He does
have significant lower extremity edema which he started
developing few months ago. He is NYHA Class II for his symptoms.
On Echocardiogram from [**2185-4-6**] Peak gradient across the aortic
valve was 54 mmHg and the mean gradient was 39 mmHg. The
calculated aortic valve area was 0.6 cm2. The RV Systolic
pressure was 49 The LVEF was approximately 60%. There was
moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension
and [**Hospital1 **]-atrial enlargement. He under went cath today which showed
not signifcant CAD but had a wedge pressure if 30. Cardiac
surgery was consulted for consideration for AVR.

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2187-4-27**]: PRE-BYPASS: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
is present in the left atrial appendage. A definite thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. The thrombus is not mobile
and appears laminated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 35-40
%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. The right pulmonary artery is dilated. There
is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
of the results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Left ventricular function is improved (LVEF = 45%).
Right ventricular function is unchanged. There is a well-seated
bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is a mean gradient of 9 mmHg at a
cardiac output of 4.9 L/min. There is a tricuspid annuloplasty
ring in place. No tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Mitral
regurgitation is unchanged. The left atrial appendage thrombus
appears unchanged. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.
.
Head CT [**2187-4-29**]: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. Correlate clinically to decide on the need for further
workup.
.
Head MRA [**2187-4-30**]: 1. Area of slow diffusion in the posterior
aspect of the pons, just anterior to the fourth ventricle, with
corresponding increased T2 FLAIR signal representing a small
subacute infarction. A punctate acute infarct is also located in
the left paramedial vermis. 2. Unremarkable MRA examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38828**] was a same day admit and was brought directly to the
operating room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement
and tricuspid valve repair. Please see operative note for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVCIU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24
hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one beta-blockers and diuretics
were started and he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. On post-op day two he appeared to have new onset facial
droop and complained of blurred vision. Neurology was consulted
and he underwent a head CT. The CT showed no acute intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect. On the next day he underwent a head
MRA which showed a small subacute infarct. Heparin and Coumadin
were started. He remained stable and was transferred to the
step-down floor on post-op day four.  He was seen by opthamology
for post-operative lateral gaze and dipolpia.  Eye drops were
recommended.  He was told that if the symptoms persist he could
patch either eye and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was seen in
consultation by the physical therapy service.  By post-operative
day six he was ready for discharge to rehab at [**Hospital6 **]
in [**Location (un) 246**].  Follow-up appointments were advised.
