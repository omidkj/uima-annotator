History of Present Illness:
HPI:  65yoF with h/o severe COPD, schizophrenia, HTN presents to
the ED with < one day of increasing respiratory distress.
History is limited to ED report as patient is intubated. HCP
notes that pt was somnolent on morning of admission - falling
asleep in her food during breakfast. Pt said that she "does not
feel quite right" but could not elaborate. She has had multiple
admissions previously for COPD flares, most recently in late
[**Month (only) **].  Per OMR, it does not appear that she has ever required
intubation, but has required ICU transfer for BiPap on multiple
admissions to which she has responded well in the past.
.
In the ED, initial vitals revealed HR 86, BP 103/50, RR 18,
O2sat 99% NRB (per triage note was documented as 60% on RA).
ABG on arrival was 7.27/95/143.  She was trialed on BiPap given
her good response on previous admissions, but repeat ABG was
7.29/91/79.  Thus, she was intubated for hypercarbic, hypoxemic
respiratory failure.  She received 125mg IV solumedrol during
her ED course.  She was also noted to be transiently hypotensive
to the 80s systolic.  She received 2L IV NS and her BP improved
to 100s systolic where it remained stable prior to transfer to
the ICU.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure:  Hypoxemic, Hypercarbic.  Given extensive
history of COPD and multiple admissions for this, appears most
consistent with COPD flare.  Hypoxia likely [**2-15**] to bronchospasm
and hypercarbia worsened with respiratory tiring and
hypoventilation.  CXR did not reveal infiltrates to suggest
pneumonia (and therefore shunting) to explain hypoxia.  Nor did
it show pulmonary edema, effusions.  Reportedly no history of
CP, but PE could less likely account for initial hypoxia, with
perhaps worsening hypercarbia secondary to tiring.  CHF was
thought to be unlikely given BNP values, neg. CXR findings, neg.
cardiac enzymes, and evidence of mild fluid overload on exam.
- Required intubation with volume cycled mechanical ventilation.
- On hospital day 2 pt was awake and alert, and was able to
communicate to the team despite intubation. AC was weaned to PS
and then extubated, which was well-tolerated
- Treatment was continued for COPD flare as below
.
# COPD:  Severe disease with FEV1 0.29 most recently evaluated
on [**2199-7-29**].  At home, requires 3L O2 via NC chronically with
BiPap at night.  Although pCO2 fluctuates, appears most
consistently 50-60 and has chronically elevated bicarb
suggestive of metabolic compensation for chronic CO2 retention.
Upon arrival to the ED, however, pCO2 was noted to be even more
markedly elevated to 90s and did not respond to noninvasive
measures including Bipap.  She was noted also to be hypoxic on
presentation, most likely in the setting of severe
bronchospasm/constriction.  Oxygenation appears to have
responded well to NRB in ED.  Had a mildly elevated WBC count to
11.1 with 82% neutrophils, no bands.  No infiltrate on CXR to
suggest underlying pneumonia.  Afebrile.  Flare may be secondary
to underlying bronchitis, most likely viral; she has received
abx previously in the setting of flare, but given lack of
history prior to ED presentation, afebrile and without
significantly elevated WBC count, Abx were initially held
- IV solumedrol 100mg q12h was changed to prednisone 60mg qd
when pt was taking po after extubation
- pt was started on albuterol and ipratropium (switched to
tiotropium)
- Taper of prednisone prescribed.
.
# ID/ bacteremia: [**8-11**] blood cultures grew GPC in clusters,
along with 7/30 sputum showing 4+ GPC in pairs/ chains/
clusters. given these results in the setting of a low grade
temperature (100.9) while on high dose corticosteriods and
leukocytosis > 11, the pt was empirically started on vancomycin
(got three days), with sensitivities pending.
- cx. were coag negative staph in 3 of 4 bottles; vanco was
stopped as this was felt to be a contaminated blood specimen.
Was afebrile off of antibiotics for 48 hours.  Antibiotics were
therefore not continued at the time of discharge; also sputum
culture only grew sparse amount of oropharyngeal flora.
.
# OSA: Bipap was continued nightly - o/p pulmonary follow up
arranged at discharge, may need re-titration of bipap.
.
# Borderline ST depression V1-V3: Ruled out for MI by enzymes.
.
# Hyperglycemia:  FS in the 200s on transfer to the ICU and w/o
known history of impaired glucose tolerance/insulin resistance
so likely [**2-15**] to steroid administration.
- covered with SSI while on steroids, but did not require this
near end of hospitalization.
.
# Hypertension:  Outpatient medications titrated back,
hydralazine dose increased.  BP controlled on discharge.
.
# Psych:  H/o depression and schizophrenia.  Continued
outpatient medications on which she is stabilized.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Continued outpatient dose of statin.
