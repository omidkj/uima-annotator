Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 47-year-old gentleman on MTX, Rituxan, and IVIG who
presents with acute on subacute anemia discovered on routine
labs.

# ANEMIA, multifactorial:  Unclear etiology, but likely the
result of marrow-toxic drugs patient has been receiving for
dermatomyositis (methotrexate, bactrim, omeprazole, and rituxan)
in the setting of baseline anemia, versus iron deficiency anemia
and occult GI bleed.  Rituxan can definitely cause a pure
anemia; unclear if the other medications cause pure anemias or
mixed cytopenias.  Hemolysis labs were normal, ruling out a
destructive etiology of anemia.  Finally, patient could be
losing blood, but again, no clear source.  He does have
gastritis and an external hemmorhoid, but unlikely to cause such
a large drop in hct.  Patient was initially transfused 5 units
of PRBCs with appropriate bump in hct.  GI was consulted who
recommended EGD/colonoscopy, though not urgently as Hct
stablilized.  Bactrim, MTX, and rituxan were discontinued.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 1968**] was started on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole and 2 large bore IVs were
placed.  Heme/onc was consulted.  Bone marrow bx was performed
on [**6-25**] showing red cell precursors and low iron.  He was
started on iron supplementation.  He will follow up with Heme
for further care.
- additionally, an EGD/colonoscopy was scheduled for [**7-1**]
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2161**].  He will continue his PPI as well.
.
# Dermatomyositis: Chronic condition (symptoms started in [**10-6**];
Flair in [**2-7**] started on high dose steroid, given two doses of
rituxan, and continued on MTX), no evidence of acute flair at
this time.  Patient is on steroids and MTX sc every week.  In
the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was continued on steroids.  His MTX and
bactrim were held, and he was put on atovaquone for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  Rheumatology was consulted.  They recommended
tapering his methyprednisolone to 8mg daily alternating with 4mg
daily.  He will follow up closely with them.
.
Community acquired pneumonia: Cough with positive chest xray.
Was given Levofloxacin 750mg daily for 5 days.
.
# Gastritis/H. Pylori:  Patient completed 1 week of triple
therapy for his H.Pylori.  His discontinued the medications
because he thought they made him feel "dizzy."  Can consider
retreating in the future once anemia stable.
