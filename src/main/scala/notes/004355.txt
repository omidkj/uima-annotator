Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  On [**2181-10-26**] Mr. [**Known lastname 36153**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
in the evening with chest pressure across lower chest
radiating to his back with a fast, irregular heartbeat.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital via EMS.  There he was
found to be in atrial fibrillation and was converted to sinus
rhythm with Lopressor and Digoxin.  His EKG showed ST
depression in leads 2, 3 and AVF and was subsequently ruled
in for an MI by enzymes with peak CK at 260 with 39 MBs, peak
troponin at 8.5.  Echocardiogram at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital showed
inferior posterior akinesis with an ejection fraction of 40%.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization and further work-up.

COPD/asthma, cataracts, status post bilateral hernia repair,
chronic renal insufficiency, history of tobacco abuse,
history of etoh use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a thin 77-year-old gentleman
in no apparent distress.  Lungs clear.  Heart, S1 and S2
regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, 2+
pulses bilaterally.  Extremities without edema.  Carotids

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11, hematocrit 38,
platelet count 241,000, sodium 141, potassium 4.8, BUN 37,
creatinine 1.3, PT 11.8, INR 1.0.  EKG as stated above.
Cardiac catheterization performed at [**Hospital1 190**] showed an ejection fraction of 40%, 80% LAD
lesion, 50% diagonal lesion, 100% OM lesion and 100% RCA
lesion.  The patient referred to cardiac surgery for further
evaluation.  On [**10-30**] the patient was taken to the operating
room by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10102**] for a CABG times three, LIMA to LAD, SVG
to OM and SVG to diagonal.  The patient was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit on Levophed and Dobutamine.  In the
operating room the patient was noted to have severe bullous
lung disease and bilateral pleural tubes were placed which
noted to have significant air leaks after the chest was
closed.  In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was noted to
have excessive chest tube output with significant episodes of
hypotension.  The patient was returned to the operating room
on the evening of [**10-30**] for re-exploration for bleeding.  The
patient continued to require inotropic support with
Dobutamine and Neo-Synephrine upon return to the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient was weaned from his inotropics by
postoperative day #1.  Multiple attempts at weaning patient
from the ventilator failed and on postoperative day #2 a
pulmonary consult was obtained due to the patient's
significant history of COPD.  On postoperative day #3 the
patient was transferred to the SICU service to assess for
further ventilator weaning as patient was unable to be weaned
from mechanical ventilation.  Postoperative day #4 the
patient developed an elevated temperature to 101.  The
patient was pancultured, antibiotics were started, Vancomycin
and Ceftazidime.  Later that day patient was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation and was quickly
reintubated for respiratory distress.  At that time it was
noted that patient still had vigorous air leak from his chest
tubes.  The patient transiently required Neo-Synephrine to
maintain blood pressure after reintubation.  On postoperative
day #5 the patient developed new onset atrial fibrillation,
was started on IV Amiodarone.  The patient again developed
elevated temperature to 101.  Sputum culture from [**11-2**] showed
E. coli and Moraxella.  Antibiotic coverage was changed from
Vancomycin, Ceftazidime to Levaquin.  The patient was again
extubated on postoperative day #6 and subsequently developed
respiratory failure.  It was attempted to place patient on
bilateral positive airway pressure ventilation which quickly
failed and patient was reintubated for respiratory failure.
At that time it was noted that patient had an elevated white
blood cell count of 20.  Sputum culture showed gram positive
cocci, coag positive, Vancomycin was restarted.  On
postoperative day #8 the patient acutely developed
hypotension, systolic blood pressures in the 50's,
subsequently resolved with fluid bolus.  EKG at that time was
negative for any ischemic changes.  CPK and troponin was
drawn and those were negative.  The patient required
Neo-Synephrine to maintain blood pressure.  A right upper
quadrant ultrasound was performed on [**11-7**] due to abdominal
pain, elevated white blood cell count, periods of hypotension
This showed stones and sludge in the gallbladder, no evidence
of acute cholecystitis.  On the morning of postoperative day
#9 the patient again acutely developed hypotension, systolic
blood pressure in the 50's, the patient was noted to be in
rate controlled atrial fibrillation, no clear etiology for
the hypotension was identified.  Attempted cardioversion
times three at 300 joules which was successful.  The patient
was able to be atrially paced via his epicardial wires.  The
patient was reloaded with IV Amiodarone.  The patient still
had bilateral pleural chest tubes in place with occasional
air leaks.  Hypotension subsequently resolved with
Neo-Synephrine and IV fluid infusion.  The patient was noted
to be having periods of agitation and was started on prn
Haldol and Ativan with the addition of Clonidine to control
agitation.  Postoperative day #10 the patient continued to
require Neo-Synephrine to maintain blood pressure as well as
continued to have periods of atrial fibrillation and periods
of sinus rhythm.  The patient was noted to have multiple
loose bowel movements and a culture for Clostridium difficile
was sent which was subsequently negative.  On [**11-10**] patient
developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
and hypotension.  The patient was cardioverted to sinus
rhythm with 200 joules.  The patient was bolused again with
IV Amiodarone and a cardiology consult was called.
Cardiology felt the periods of atrial fibrillation were due
to patient's multiple medical problems and recommended
continuing the IV Amiodarone and thought that as patient's
condition improved, the atrial fibrillation would
subsequently resolve.  On postoperative day #12 the patient
was noted to have continued hallucinations.  The patient was
continued to be medicated with Haldol and Ativan as needed.
The patient was again noted to have a rising white blood cell
count to 18 and his left pleural chest tube was removed as
the tube had not had an air leak for several days.  On
postoperative day #13 all narcotics and Haldol were
discontinued due to the hallucinations.  Vancomycin was
discontinued at the request of the infectious disease
department as no positive sputum culture had been obtained.
The patient continued on Levaquin for the previous positive
sputum culture of E. coli and Moraxella.  On postoperative
day #14 the patient self extubated.  The patient immediately
had a tenuous respiratory status which slowly improved with
vigorous pulmonary toilet and Vancomycin was again restarted
for culture that showed gram positive cocci in sputum.  The
patient remained in Intensive Care Unit for pulmonary toilet.
On postoperative day #16 the right pleural chest tube was
removed, the patient was started on Diamox due to a metabolic
alkalosis.  The patient was also noted to have signs and
symptoms of aspiration and felt that it was unsafe to give
patient enteral feeds.  The patient was started on TPN for
nutrition.  On postoperative day #17 the patient was noted to
have a left effusion on his chest x-ray.  The patient
underwent thoracentesis in the SICU.  1300 cc of dark
serosanguineous fluid was removed.  The patien
