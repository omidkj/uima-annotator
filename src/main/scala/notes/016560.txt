RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Mildly dilated descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Severely thickened/deformed
aortic valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Severe AS
with a valve area of 0.9The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild MR .There is no pericardial effusion.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   58 year old man s/p AVR/CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal



Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY: AVR, CABG, chest tube removed, evaluate for
pneumothorax.

CHEST, AP:

All the tubes have now been removed. The film is somewhat
over-penetrated,
particularly for the apex and though no pneumothorax is
identified, this is
not entirely excluded. Bibasilar atelectasis, worse in the left
side is
present.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax is seen, but films are somewhat
over-penetrated.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2-1**] Mr.[**Known lastname **], with known aortic stenosis, presented for
preop cardiac catheterization and admission for aortic valve
surgery. Cath revealed a 70% LAD lesion.[**2-2**] He was taken to
the operating room and underwent aortic valve replacement with a
#21mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve and coronary artery bypass
grafting with the left internal mammary artery grafted to the
left anterior descending artery. Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) **]
operative report for further details. He was intubated,
requiring Neosynephrine and propofol for sedation and blood
pressure optimization. He was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition. He required Precedex to allow for vent weaning and
was extubated shortly thereafter without difficulty. All lines
and drains were removed in a timely fashion. POD#1 Mr.[**Known lastname **]
was transferred to the step down unit for further telemetry
monitoring. He was started on Coumadin for anticoagulation for
the mechanical valve.Beta-blocker, statin,and aspirin were all
initiated. He continued to do well. POD#3 Heparin was started to
bridge the subtherapeutic INR. INR goal 2.5-3.5 per mechanical
valve protocol. He continued to progress and it was felt he was
ready for discharge to home on POD#5. It was arranged with his
PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Name (NI) 2935**] office to follow his INR/Coumadin dosing. He
was advised of all follow up appointments.
