Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
61 y.o. Male with h.o. CAD s/p 5v CABG, CHF s/p AICD, systolic
and diastolic dysfunction, hypothyroidism, A. fib p/w dyspnea.

Pt states that yesterday evening he noted sudden onset of
shortness of breath. He denies any fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, chest pain, melena, hemetemesis, hematochezia,
diarrhea, constipation.

In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's initial VS were noted to be T96.2, HR 68, BP
118/84, RR 24, Sat 96%. His initial EKG was concerning for
possible V tach however on further review it was noted to be A.
fib with aberrancy, pt was given 5mg IV Lopressor which resulted
in decrease of HR from 130s to the low 100s, SBP down to the mid
90s. Pt underwent CXR which showed fluid overload and he was
thus given Furosemide 40mg x 1. He was also given Vancomycin 1gm
IV x 1 due to concern for possible PNA. His labs were notable
for lactate of 13.7, mild leukocytosis of 12.3. ALT/AST were
noted to be 133/243, Alk Phos 257 with a TB of 5.1. His glc was
noted to be 42 with an anion gap acidosis. His INR was noted to
be 3.4, Digoxin level 0.3, BNP 6682. He received a RUQ U/S which
showed edematous gallbladder wall but no cholecystitis, pt also
had cholelithiasis. He also had a right IJ placed and underwent
a CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast to eval for source of high
lactate. CT scna was negative for bowel wall thickening,
pneumotosis but did showed ground glass opacities in the lung.
Prior to the CT scan he was given Levofloxacin and Zosyn given
his acutely ill appearance and elevated lactate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**2159-8-24**] for acute onset dyspnea.

Patient is a 61 yom with h.o. of severe systolic and diastolic
function s/p AICD, CAD s/p 5v CABG, hypothyroidism, A. fib p/w
acute onset dyspnea, elevated lactate, transaminitis and fluid
overloaded on exam.

##. Elevated Lactate: Pt noted to have an elevated lactate of
13.7 on admission. Unclear as to the exact etiology of the
Lactate level. Initial workup included osmolar gap (1), serum
tox (negative), co-oximetry (negative), and cyanide (pending).
Level was followed an rapidly trended down to 3.4 with fluids
and diuresis. Infection was considered however in the setting of
a mild leukocytosis and lack of fever and unconvincing history,
this seemed less likely. Patient was pan cultured and a CXR was
performed demonstrating substantial fluid overload. It was later
felt that the lactate resulted from hypoperfusion stemming from
prolonged SVT with abberancy. Lactate level was 1.7 on the day
of discharge.

##. Dyspnea/CHF exacerbation: Pt presented to ED with complaint
of SOB of sudden onset with no chest pain. On physical
examination pt noted to have JVP, elevated elevated BNP and CXR
which suggest fluid overload. CHF exacerbation was immediately
suspected, flash pulmonary edema during episode of AF with RVR.
Cardiac enzymes were cylced and were negative and dyspnea
quickly resolved with diuresis. He responded well to IV lasix
(negative > 3 liters on [**2159-8-26**]), and given the concern for
further excess fluid, he was instructed to take 60 mg PO daily
for two days after returning home instead of his usual 40 mg.
