Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 39 yo F with asthma, tobacco abuse, B SPO for ectopics who
p/w SOB and cough. States has been having cold sx's "all winter"
off and on, including fevers, chills, productive cough,
myalgias, and malaise. She awoke on the day of admission with
increased SOB relieved with inhalers. Because of the dyspnea,
she came into ED. States she was not able to get air into her
lungs. She specifically notes increased asthma symptoms since
the weather has become more cold over the past few weeks (she
works outside as a postal worker) and has begun using her MDI's
several times a day compared with one every few days to weeks in
the past. She has never been intubated for asthma, nor has she
been admitted to the hospital for asthma symptoms.  Her
infrequent need for inhalers and her ocasional symptoms
classified her as in the past having mild-intermittent asthma.
She reports no recent travel. Sick contacts include her son who
had "a pneumonia" one week prior to the patient's presentation.
In the ED, the pt was initially hypoxic at 89%, improving to 95%
with nebulizers but she became tachycardic to 110's with
albuterol and required multiple nebs with her peak flow 275 at
best. When a lactate level drawn was 7.1, the patient met
criteria for "code sepsis."  She was thereafter volume
resuscitated with 3L NS and admitted to the medical ICU.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2129-2-28**] 2:27 PM
HISTORY: 39 year old woman with fevers, coughm asthma
exacerbation
FINDINGS: The heart size and mediastinal contours are within
normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature appears unremarkable.
No focal pulmonary parenchymal consolidation is identified. No
pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. The surrounding osseous
structures appear unremarkable. The area of interest on the
previous AP portable chest x ray within the right upper lung
field is normal in the absence of overlying oxygen tubing.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2129-3-2**] 9:13 PM
HISTORY: Asthma, cough and fever with diminished right lower
zone breath sounds.
FINDINGS: Heart size is normal. There is slight flattening of
the diaphragms. The lungs are clear. The pulmonary vasculature
and mediastinum are unremarkable and there are no pleural
effusions.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for pneumonia or other significant
abnormality and no change since prior study of [**2129-2-28**].


Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo F with h/o mild-intermittent asthma and tob abuse (1 pack
per week) who presented after a months of upper respiratory
symptoms with productive cough, myalgias, fever, dyspnea, and
elevated lactate meeting sepsis protocol. She had significant
reactive airways disease which was partially relieed with
nebulizers.  Sick contacts include her son, who per the
patient's report had a recent "pnemonia." She also had a Hct of
41.9 at admission suggesting volume depletion. She was given 3 L
of NS and treated empirically without a known source (ddx
included bronchitis or CAP, viral or bacterial in origin).
Because she received solumedrol for asthma symptoms, a cortisol
stimulation test could not be reliably performed to test for
adrenal insufficiency.  She was later transitioned to
prednisone.  Her lactate decreased over time and most recently
was 0.7.  Her hematocrit decreased appropriately with NS volume
expansion to 33.9.  Her WBC peaked at 12.0 with 90% PMN's but no
bands and has since resolved to 8.9.  To date, all culture data,
including influenza DFA, viral and bacterial cultures are
negative.
.
1. Sepsis: source likely viral (? influenza) vs. bronchitis
(either viral or bacterial)
-On levofloxacin for 10-day course starting [**2128-2-29**], ending
[**2128-3-9**] to cover for CAP.
-Ruled out for influenza
-Sputum cx negative
-Blood cx's all negative.
-LFT's normal.
-No indication for cortisol stimulation since received/ing
solumedrol/prednisone.
-MAPs>65 maintained easily and the patient was transitioned
within 24 hours to the medical [**Hospital1 **] from the medical ICU.
.
2. Asthma: peak flows increased over 2-3 days from 250 to as
high as 330. The patient continued to have good oxygen
saturation levels.  A CXR pending on [**2129-3-2**] acquired for
decreased breath sounds at right base was completely normal.
-The patient was discharged on standing MDIs and prn nebulizers;
she was given a prescription for the acquisition of a nebulizer
machine.
-Levofloxacin was continued empirically for treatment of a
possible culture-negative CAP causing reactive airways disease
in an asthmatic patient.
-Prednisone was continued after discharge for a 2-week taper; it
may need to be extended if she has distress during the taper.
-An insulin sliding scale was dosed while an inpatient on
steroids but beause the patient easily maintained finger stick
blood glucose levels <165 and the patient was discharged on a
steroid taper, she was not discharged on insulin.
.
3. FEN: The patient was maintained on a po regular diet while an
inpatient.
.
4. Ppx: SC heparin, bowel regimen, PPI given while on high dose
steroids.
.
5. Dispo: The patient was discharged to home once her asthma
symptoms stabilized.
.
6. Full Code.
.
7. Follow-up: The patient will require follow-up for 1)
assessment of her respiratory function during the prednisone
taper, 2) for initiation of a chronic asthma regimen, and 3) for
possible tobacco cessation to limit this asthma trigger,
especially considering her desire not to stop working outdoors.
