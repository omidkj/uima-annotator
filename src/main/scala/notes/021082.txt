[**4-4**]
--ECHO:The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic function. Severe aortic stenosis. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation.
--CT chest:Small bilateral pleural effusion. Complete
obstruction of the left lower lobe
bronchus, could be due to foreign body, tumor or mucoid
impaction with almost
complete collapse of the left lower lobe. Minimal septal
thickening and
multifocal ground-glass opacity, could be due to mild
interstitial edema.
Minimal emphysema. Scattered lymph nodes. Severe aortic valvular

calcification and mitral annulus calcification. Moderate
coronary artery
calcification.


Brief Hospital Course:
# NSTEMI: Pt presented with CP to OSH which resolved with SL
NTG. Also had enzyme leak and ekg changes. She was continued ASA
325, Lipitor 80, BB and heparin drip. She underwent cardiac cath
which showed three vessel coronary artery disease.  As she was
found to have severe AS, and would require AVR in the future,
the plan was to perform CABG at that time.  The patient wanted
to be dishcarged prior to surgery, thus scheduled to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient this week.  She was discharged
on high dose aspirin and statin as well as a beta blocker.  An
ACE-I was not started given the patient's severe aortic
stenosis.

# Severe Aortic Stenosis:   Previously the patient's documented
valve area was 1 cm2, however on TTE here showed worsening AS
with a valve area of 0.8cm2.  She was managed medically and will
have AVr in the next few weeks.

# Resp failure: Likely from pulmonary edema. She was diuresed
carefull given AS and preload dependence. She was continued on
pressure support while awaiting cath. After cath she was
extubated without difficulty. She remained without an o2
requirement prior to discharge.

# PNA: CXR showed possibility of post-obstructive PNA. She
underwent chest CT which showed similar findings. A bronchoscopy
was done which showed no mass. BAL washings were pending at time
of discharge and will be followed up by her pcp.

# Fever: fever to 100.4. UA was positive and patient was started
on Cipro and then switched to zosyn when Ct was read as positive
for PNA. She was discharged on augmentin.

# UTI: Patient was initially treated with Cipro however switched
to Zosyn for PNA coverage as above. Augmentin was continued on
discharge.

# HTN: continued metoprolol and amlodipine as patient had
tolerated them at home.

# Depression: celexa
