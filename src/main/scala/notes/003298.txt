Allergies:
Amoxicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2074**]
Chief Complaint:
worsening SOB and chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
78 M with PMH HTN, hypercholesterolemia, Parkinson's Disease,
CRF (baseline Cr 1.2-1.5), presents with worsening SOB, chest
pressure, N/V, sweating. Pt denied fever, chills or cough.  He
notes PND and orthopnea.  Recieved Lasix 80IV, and NTG at HebReb
with some relief. No cough, no sputum, no F/C. +PND, +orthopnea,
worsening SOB since discharged from [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Pt was recently discharged 1 wk ago for sepsis secondary to MRSA
aspiration pneumonia (requiring pressors, intubation), stress
dose steroids (adrenal insufficiency).  Hospital course
complicated by hypertensive episodes and acute renal failure.
He was treated with and discharged on Vanco/Levo/Flagyl.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be tachypneic, tachycardic, BP
199/113. Pt was started on NTG drip, given Lasix 80 IV x1, which
improved his SOB. Pt's chest pressure improved on NTG, and he
had good urine output. EKG showed rate 116, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] elevations
in V2-V3 (J point elevation), troponin 2.09.

Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with his wife.  A former International
Relations professor.  independent in most ADLs.  Smoked
previously, but quit 45 years ago,  had 5 years of 1ppd.

Family History:
son and daughter have renal cysts

Physical Exam:
Vitals:  BP: 160/104 P: 98 RR: 24 Oxygen sat: 96% on RA FS 172
Gen: NAD in bed, not acutely SOB
HEENT: JVD to 10 cm, no LAD
Lungs: Rales in bases bilaterally
Heart: [**1-11**] apical SEM, no r/g
Abd: Distended, +BS, obese, soft, diffusely mildly tender, 3+
hip/sacral edema, scars.  Guiaic negative.
Neuro: [**3-10**] motor LUE, [**4-9**] motor RUE, [**2-7**] motor LEs, 3+ lower
extremity edema


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**7-16**]:
1. Moderate congestive failure.
2. Unchanged parenchymal opacities bilaterally within the lower
lobes. These were previously described as aspiration pneumonia.

3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
Echo [**7-10**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed however views are
technically suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal
septal/anterior, apical and basal inferior hypokinesis
(estimated ejection fraction ?35-40%. No definite apical
thrombus seen but cannot exclude. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
report of the prior study (tape unavailable for review) of
[**2177-1-16**], left ventricular systolic function is now significant
impaired and mitral regurgitation is now more prominent.
.
Stress MIBI [**7-10**]:
Moderate fixed inferior wall perfusion defect.  Transient
ischemic dilatation of the left ventricle.  Moderate global
hypokinesis with LV EF of 38%.
.
Cardiac catheterization [**7-10**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA was very short
versus dual
ostia. The LAD was calcified and diffusely diseased. There was a
50%
proximal stenosis and then a 70% stenosis after the takeoff of
the D1.
The distal LAD had moderate diffuse disease. The D1 had moderate
diffuse
disease proximally. The LCx had a 60% ostial stenosis and then a
serial
70% stenosis in the proximal segment. There was moderate diffuse
disease
in the distal LCx. The OM1 had an 80% stenosis at its origin.
The L-PL
had mild diffuse disease. The RCA was totally occluded which
appeared
chronic. There were moderate left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics from right heart catheterization
demonstrated
mildly elevated right and left heart filling pressures
(RVEDP=13mmHg,
mean PCWP=17mmHg). There was moderate pulmonary and systemic
arterial
hypertension (PA=47/17mmHg, Ao=170/67mmHg). The calculated
cardiac
output by the Fick method was 6.4 L/min with a cardiac index of
2.8.
Moderate hypoxemia was noted with an arterial oxygen saturation
of 88%
on 2L O2 by nasal cannula.
3. A cardiothoracic surgery evaluation is recommended. However,
given
that this patient may not be an ideal surgical candidate given
his
comorbidities, a persantine MIBI may be consider. This would
allow
identification of a major area at risk for ischemic which then
can
potentially be intervened upon via PCI.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78 M with PMH of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, Parkinson's ds,
CRF (with baseline Cr 1.2-1.5), discharged 1 wk ago for MRSA
aspiration pna (requiring pressors, intubation), d/ced on
Vanco/Levo/Flagyl, presented on [**2178-7-16**] with worsening SOB,
chest pressure, N/V, sweating, found to have NSTEMI.
.
1. NSTEMI: Though it was a NSTEMI, his echo shows a large area
of hypokinesis which is new. He was pain free after admission
and his CK trended downward. His cath was initially deferred
secondary to worsened CRI.  During this time, he was maintained
on ASA/BB/heparin/statin.  He was originally started on a nitro
drip but this was d/c in favor of hydralazine and isordil during
this time period.  His ace-i was held secondary to his worsening
renal function but restarted once his kidney function
normalized.  As his creatinine improved he was taken to cath
where he was seen to have 3VD.  He was evaluated by cardiac
surgery who felt that he was too high risk to intervene on.  He
had a stress MIBI showing global hypokinesis with transient
ischemic dilitation suggesting that a focused PCI would not be
effective.  It was decided to medically manage the patient.
.
2. SOB: On admission he was volume-overloaded by exam and CXR
and was unable to lie flat for any period of time.  This was
also complicated by an infectious picture.  He was originally
maintained on a nitroglycerin drip that was titrated off over
his admission and replaced by hydralazine and isordil.  Because
of his previous admission for PNA, vancomycin/flagyl/ceftazidime
were continued for a 10d course.  His CXR gradually improved and
he began autodiuresing.  He was able lie flat and his O2
requirement was weaned.  His hydralazine and isordil were
switched to an ace-i prior to d/c.
.
3. Anemia: On admission, the pt had a baseline HCT of 27-33 and
iron studies c/w an anemia of chronic disease.  Secondary to his
ischemia, he was transfused x3 units over three days to maintain
his HCT over 30.  He remained guaiac negative throughout his
admission and was maintained on GI prophylaxis.
.
4. Tachyarrhythmia: He had an episode of afib on the day after
admission that was self limited and never recurred.  He was
maintained on bblocker for rate control throughout his admission
and had no further episodes.
.
5. Hypertension:  His hypertension was initially managed with
metoprolol which was titrated up to 75tid but further titration
was limited by HR.  He was initially also maintained isordil and
hydralazine but these were switched to lisinopril as his
creatinine normalized.  His lisinopril was titrated up to 40qd
on the day of discharge as his SBP was still in the 160s.  He
will need continued outpatient management of his blood pressure
meds and will need to have his BP checked at his rehab facility.
.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: He was maintained on a statin
throughout his admission.
.
7. Lower back pain: He received his outpatient oxycodone doses
while hospitalized.
.
8. Parkinson's Disease: He was maintained on carbidopa/levadopa
at home doses.
.
9. GERD: He was fed a cardiac diet and kept on
