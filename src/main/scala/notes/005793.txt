PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient is afebrile,
blood pressure 127/79, pulse 97, respiratory rate 24, oxygen
saturation 99% on five liters.  In general, the patient is an
ill appearing male using accessory muscles for respiration.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  Pulmonary - Decreased breath
sounds at the left one third up; otherwise clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, bowel sounds positive.  Extremities - 2 to 3+
pitting edema bilaterally.  Dorsalis pedis 2+ bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 32.4 on admission.  CK 453,
troponin I of 15.6, CK MB 90, creatinine 1.9 which is at his
baseline chronic renal insufficiency.  Albumin 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac - The patient underwent catheterization on
[**2199-1-8**].  The patient had elevated filling pressures with a
mean [**Doctor Last Name **] of 225 mmHg and left ventricular ejection fraction
of 40% on left ventriculogram with global hypokinesis.  The
left main coronary artery was 10% and left anterior
descending was 60% proximal, 50% distal tubular, left
circumflex showed proximal 40% and mid 60% and occluded OM1,
patent OM2, which was crossed with Cypher stent, 0% in-stent
occlusion, proximal 30 to 40% disease left untreated, right
coronary artery mild disease.

Postcatheterization, the patient did well from a cardiac
standpoint.  He was continued on his Aspirin, Plavix, beta
blocker and statin.  The patient was felt to be in heart
failure postcatheterization given his elevated filling
pressures and he was diuresed.  The patient had no further
cardiac issues during the rest of his hospital admission.

2.  Gastrointestinal bleed - On [**2199-1-13**], the patient had
bright red blood per rectum and a stat hematocrit showed a
drop in his hematocrit from 32.0 to 24.0.  The patient's
systolic blood pressure was stable at 130.  The patient had
no associated symptoms.  Nasogastric lavage was attempted
twice, but the patient refused.  The patient was transfused
on unit and then taken for a tagged red blood cell scan.  The
tagged red blood cell scan showed a small bleed at the
hepatic flexure.  Gastroenterology was consulted.  The
patient was continued on q4hour hematocrit checks, given
platelets and the patient then had an upper scope on
[**2199-1-14**], which showed normal esophagus and normal stomach
and normal duodenum.  A colonoscopy showed on [**2199-1-16**], an
ulcerated heaped up tissue versus neoplasm versus
inflammatory mass with overlying clot.  The lesion had an
active pumping vessel visualized and this was injected with
8cc of Epinephrine.  This stopped, but then another visible
vessel spurted red blood was then seen.  The area was then
injected with another 8cc of Epinephrine.  No biopsy was done
at this time.  The patient at this time had been transferred
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit due to his active
gastrointestinal bleeding.  The patient prior to colonoscopy
had attempted to go to angiogram for embolization of the
bleeding site seen on the tagged red blood cell scan but they
were unable to embolize.  The patient's hematocrit then was
stable times 36 hours.  The patient's bleed initially had
been in the setting of being on Heparin as well as Aspirin
and Plavix postcatheterization.  All these were stopped while
the patient was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His last
transfusion was on [**2199-1-16**], and his bowel movement after
that was brown.  The patient was transferred out to the floor
to the Medicine service where the patient was monitored
closely with q.day hematocrit checks.  Gastroenterology
continued to follow the patient and on [**2199-1-21**], rescoped the
patient for biopsy.  All that was seen was friability,
congestion and erythema in the proximal ascending colon in
the area of the previous bleed.  The cecum and the splenic
flexure and all of this was consistent with segmental
colitis.  A biopsy was taken of the area.  The patient had
continued on his Plavix during his stay on the floor but his
Aspirin had been held during this entire time.  The patient's
hematocrit dropped from 31.9 to 28.5 postcolonoscopy
overnight.  The patient had brown stools with occasional
flecks of blood.  The patient was transfused one unit on
[**2199-1-22**], to keep his hematocrit above 30.0 given his
coronary artery disease.

3.  Renal - The patient had chronic renal insufficiency
secondary to diabetes mellitus.  His creatinine became quite
elevated postcatheterization thought to be secondary to dye
load.  The patient did receive Mucomyst.  With continued
monitoring over the course of his admission, his creatinine
came down to his baseline of 1.4.

4.  Diabetes mellitus - The patient had elevated blood sugar
during admission.  He was continued on his Lantus as well as
regular sliding scale insulin without significant
complication.  On discharge, the patient's hematocrit was
stable postbiopsy and this will be followed up as an
outpatient.  He has had no chest pain and no shortness of
breath.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to the
[**Location 54284**] where he is an inmate.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Plavix 75 mg one p.o. once daily.
2.  Atorvastatin 10 mg one p.o. once daily.
3.  Protonix 40 mg one p.o. once daily.
4.  Glargine insulin 17 units subcutaneous once daily.
5.  Sliding scale insulin.
6.  Toprol XL 200 mg once daily.
7.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. once daily.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow-up with
gastroenterology service on [**2199-1-30**], for follow-up of the
patient's biopsy.  The patient should follow-up with the
infirmary doctor to follow his blood sugar, his renal
function and his hematocrit.
