Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Adhesive Tape

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1042**]
Chief Complaint:
leukocytosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Radiation therapy
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
64 M with MMP including CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, metastatic poorly
differentiated CA, likely NSLCA. He is s/p multiple recent
admissions, most recently from [**3-7**] - [**2198-3-22**] for respiratory
failure requiring intubation, thought due to volume overload
from a missed HD session.
.
He was d/c'ed to rehab on [**3-22**]. Per the patient, he has been
improving at rehab, gaining strength. He has had continued cough
occasiionally productive of a rusty-colored sputum associated
with some dyspnea on exertion, though he is not able to quantify
the amount of exertion required. He denies rest dyspnea, and
denies orthopnea or PND. Aside from the rust-colored sputum, he
denies any frank hemoptysis. He has not had any chest pain, n/v,
f/c/s.
.
He was at [**Location (un) **] hemodialysis where he was noted to have a Hb of
7.1, and sent in to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaluation.
.
In ED, he denied any symptoms including CP, SOB, LH, or fatigue.
A laboratory evaluation revealed a Hb of 7.9 and Hct 27.0 (Hct
prior to discharge appears 26-28, though last Hct 35.4 but no
evidence of transfusion). Labs also remarkable for WBC of 22
with a poly predominance. CXR showed a new left basilar opacity,
thought to represent atelectasis vs infection. He was ordered
for 2U pRBCs, vanco, levoflox, and cefepime.
.
Currently, his only complaint is his chronic neck pain, which is
less well controlled this morning because he may have missed a
dose of his pain medication.


Past Medical History:
#. Onc HX: [**12-11**] pre-renal transplant CT scan chest noted
enlarged RML nodule, w/ subcentimeter FDG avid scattered lymph
nodes. Developed neck pain and found to have C2 pathological
fracture, [**11-22**] cytology demonstrated poorly differentiated
carcinoma. Likely non-small cell lung carcinoma, with RML mass
and metastasis to the cervical and sacral spine. The only
manifestation of his disease currently is cervical neck pain,
s/p pathologic fracture and posterior cervical arthrodesis C1-C3
and palliative XRT.

65 year old man with high white count
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pna
INDICATION: 65-year-old male with high white count. Please
evaluate for pneumonia.

FINDINGS: Single portable upright chest radiograph is reviewed
and compared to [**2198-3-15**], and to CTA of the chest from [**2198-1-21**].
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. Multifocal areas of
opacity scattered throughout both lungs are largely similar to
previous exam, and consistent with metastatic lung cancer.
Dominant right hilar mass is similar in appearance. There is new
streaky opacity at the left lung base, with associated volume
loss, which may represent atelectasis, although underlying
infectious process cannot be excluded. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax. Radiopaque density projecting over the
upper thoracic spine is unchanged in appearance, maybe related
to prior vertebroplasty.

IMPRESSION:
1. New left basilar streaky airspace opacity and volume loss,
may represent atelectasis, although this is concerning for
underlying infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Unchanged appearance of multifocal opacities consistent with
metastatic lung cancer, and dominant right hilar mass.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old man with bony metastases known to C,L,S spine, now
with decreased rectal tone and urinary retention
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for cauda equina syndrome, extent of bony mets with
gadolinium
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: esrd, will advise renal, pt
to get dialysis post-procedure

INDICATION: 65-year-old with diffusely metastatic adenocarcinoma
and now with decreased rectal tone and urinary incontinence.
Evaluate for cauda equina syndrome.

COMPARISON: MRI of the lumbar spine, [**2197-11-15**].

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, T2, and STIR as well as axial T1 and T2
images through the sacrum were obtained.

FINDINGS: There has been interval development of extensive tumor
infiltration of the sacrum since the prior exam of [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2196**]. Previously, the patient had a capacious thecal sac
extending into the sacrum. Now there is extensive tumor
infiltration throughout the sacrum, which obliterate
