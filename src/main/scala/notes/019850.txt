Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR guided doboff placement X 2


History of Present Illness:
70 yo female with a past history of DM, CHF, PVD, CAD s/p CABG
who p/w abd pain on [**4-27**] to [**Location (un) 1459**]. She presented to [**Hospital1 18**] as
a transfer for further management of acute pancreatitis. On
presentation at the OSH patient was found to have an elevated
lipase 14,510 and amylase 4290 with a CT abdomen consistent with
pancreatitis. She does not have a history of abominal pain on
pancreatitis. Ultrasound confirmed the presence of gallstones
and there was some mild CBD dilitation. She was managed
supportively with pain medication, IVFs and TPN. Fluid
resusication was complicated by thirdspacing and new pleural
effusions on CXR. On [**4-30**], patient developed bradycardia, so she
received epi/atropine/calcium with compressions, and was
intubated and transferred to the ICU. EKG showed transient
lateral STDs which improved without intervention, and enzymes
remained flat. The following day she was started on vanco/clinda
and later cipro for presumed aspiration pneumonia. CXR showed
volume overloaded, so she was diuresed and extubated on [**5-2**].
She was transitioned to bipap. Amylase, lipase and LFTs
normalized on [**5-3**]. A repeat CT scan was performed on [**5-3**] to
evaluate for pseudocyst given rising WBC and fevers to 102.2,
but this was negative. patient had some anemia with a nadir hct
of 24.9 and received 2 u PRBC. Patient also developed [**Last Name (un) **] while
in the hospital, but this improved to 1.2 prior to transfer,
which was felt to be secondary to ATN per renal consultation. In
addition to renal, surgery, GI and critical care were involved
with the patient's care.
.
On transfer, patient is sedated but responds to verbal stimuli.
She is denying abdominal pain.

IMAGING:
RUQ US: Tiny [**Doctor Last Name 5691**]-like stones seen within the gallbladder and
there
also is a layer of sludge. There are no signs of cholecystitis.
No biliary
dilatation. Small right pleural effusion.
.
CT Torso: 1. Acute pancreatitis, with extensive inflammation and
free fluid tracking through mesentery and into thorax. Findings
concerning for necrosis of the pancreatic neck and proximal
body.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Pulmonary hypertension.
4. Age-indeterminate L3 compression deformity.
.
NCHCT: 1. Diffuse cerebral atrophy, without acute intracranial
process.
2. Under-pneumatized mastoids, with fluid opacification. Please
correlate
clinically for evidence of mastoiditis.
.
Video Swallow:
FINDINGS:

Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and esophagus
without evidence of
obstruction. There was no gross aspiration. Multiple episodes of
penetration
were noted with thin and thick consistency barium. For details,
please refer
to speech and swallow division note in OMR.

IMPRESSION:

No evidence of aspiration. Multiple episodes of penetration with
thin and
thick consistency barium.
.
MRCP:
FINDINGS: Extensive high signal intensity is present within the
pancreas
consistent with acute inflammation. The pancreas also has
reduced signal
intensity on T1-weighted imaging. There is a focal area of
non-enhancement
within the neck of the pancreas with an adjacent intrapancreatic
fluid
collection. These findings are suggestive of necrosis. The
remainder of the
pancreas enhances normally post-contrast. The pancreatic duct is
nondilated.

A number of fluid collections are noted in the lesser sac, the
largest
measuring 5.4 x 3.6 cm. A further 4.5 x 3.5 cm collection is
present adjacent
to the head of the pancreas, this collection extends cranially
to the level of
the caudate lobe of the liver. A fluid collection is also noted
tracking over
the right lobe of liver.

There is layering of fluid in the neck of the gallbladder likely
a composite
of small stones and sludge. No
