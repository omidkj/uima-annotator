CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from [**Hospital3 **]-[**Location (un) 32487**] in [**Location 32488**]for bronchial stenting

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 54-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus
Type 2, idiopathic cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis, chronic
pancreatitis, and tracheomalacia, who presents from an
outside hospital, [**Location (un) 32487**]-[**Hospital3 **] in [**State 531**] City, for
bronchial stenting.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has been hospitalized in
[**2158-8-6**] for pneumonia.  She was hospitalized for a
week, continued to have progressive dyspnea after this
hospitalization.  Three weeks prior to coming to [**Hospital1 346**], she developed increasing shortness
of breath, cough with productive sputum, low-grade
temperature, and was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **]-[**Location (un) 32487**] for
treatment of complicated bronchitis.  This admission occurred
on [**2158-9-6**].  Her hospital course in [**State 531**] was
complicated by continued episodes of dyspnea, at first
attributed to mucous plugging, but later bronchoscopy
revealing granulation tissue overgrowth around her previous
stents, resulting in an obstruction.  She was treated with
multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and, at the time
of transfer to [**Hospital1 69**] on the
[**9-26**], she was on clindamycin.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] in hopes of clearing
granulation tissue and restenting.

Upon presentation, the patient denied any overt chest pain.
She does report some shortness of breath.  She reports
three-pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She
currently denies any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or
constipation.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is oxygen-dependent at home.  She
uses 2 liters approximately 90% of the time.  She has
shortness of breath at rest, and dyspnea on exertion.  She
can currently walk ten feet before needing to stop secondary
to dyspnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation, temperature 98.9,
heart rate 72, blood pressure 107/65, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 97% on 1 liter.  In general, a pleasant,
middle-aged woman in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat:  Sclerae without icterus, extraocular
movements intact, pupils equal, round and reactive to light.
Neck:  Supple, no carotid bruits.  Heart:  Distant sounds,
obscured by harsh breath sounds.  She does have a midline
surgical scar, which is well healed.  Lungs with diffuse
bilateral rhonchi and upper airway breath sounds.  Abdomen:
Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, with active bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Warm, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, no
edema in the extremities:  Neurologic:  She is alert and
oriented x 3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the
Interventional Pulmonology team, including Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is well known to Dr.[**Name (NI) 14680**] service, as she has
had previous tracheal stents placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] several
years prior.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has multiple bronchoscopies.  On
[**9-27**] she had a diagnostic bronchoscopy that showed a Y
stent in place.  Polyps of tissue were seen just beyond the
distal ends of the stent in the main stem bronchus, leading
to 80 to 90% narrowing of the lumens of the bronchus.  On
[**9-28**], she had another bronchoscopy.  On this
bronchoscopy, a Y stent was again present.  The granulation
tissue was again noted at the distal ends of the stent.
Multiple attempts were made to remove the Y stent, initially
unsuccessful due to adherence.  Eventually [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**] bougie
was used to separate the stent from the tracheal wall, and
the stent was eventually removed.  Mitomycin-C was applied to
the granulation tissue.

Following her bronchoscopy, on the 24th, she was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit service secondary to intubation
following the bronchoscopy.  The bronchoscopy led to a
significant amount of airway edema, necessitating intubation.
She was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
service for further management of her ventilatory status.

On further rigid bronchoscopy on [**9-29**], a YAG laser
was used to destruct the granulation tissue in the right main
stem bronchus.  A Polyflex stent #10 x 20 mm was placed in
the right main stem bronchus, soon to be replaced by a larger
Polyflex stent, size 12 x 30 mm.  A 12 x 30 mm Polyflex stent
was also placed in the left main stem bronchus, covering the
granulation tissue.  A Dumon stent, size 14 x 20 mm, was
placed in the right main stem bronchus.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted
to have transient hypoxia, which was quickly relieved during
that bronchoscopy.

A subsequent bronchoscopy on [**9-30**] revealed thick
copious secretions.  Stents were present in excellent
position.  A bronchoscopy on the [**10-3**] again
revealed copious secretions, and stents in place.  A
bronchoscopy on the [**10-4**] showed stents still in
place.  A new Dumon stent, size 16 x 40 mm, was placed in the
trachea, terminating above the main carina.  This
bronchoscopy was again a rigid bronchoscopy, done in the
operating room.

On [**10-5**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was able to be weaned from the
ventilator, and was subsequently extubated.  On [**10-7**],
her respiratory status was subsequently resolved, and she was
subsequently transferred to the Medical floor on supplemental
oxygen.  On [**10-11**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have some
shortness of breath and was unable to clear her own
secretions.  At this point, she was transferred back to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of her secretions.
Subsequently she required intubation for failure to clear the
secretions, and pending respiratory distress.  This was
carried out with rapid-sequence intubation pre-oxygenation
with 100% oxygen, etomidate 20 mg intravenously,
succinylcholine 120 mg intravenously, and was carried out
without any complications.

On the [**10-11**], she had another bronchoscopy, noted
copious white viscous secretions, only partially cleared with
lavage.  A 5 x 5 mm solid granular tissue was also suctioned
and sent to Pathology.  On the [**10-12**], another
bronchoscopy revealed that the right main stem stent had
near-complete obstruction of her right upper lobe.  The stent
was pulled back to 3 mm, and the orifice was only 20%
obstructed.  Again noted copious secretions.

On [**10-13**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken back to the operating room
for another bronchoscopy.  This bronchoscopy again revealed
copious bilateral secretions, primarily emanating from the
right upper lobe.  The right main stem stent was removed.
Subsequently a 14 x 20 mm Dumon stent was placed, with good
right upper lobe patency.

At the time of dictation, Ms. [**Known lastname **] remains intubated.  She
is currently on ventilatory settings of pressure support with
oxygen saturation of 100% on an FIO2 of 40%, pressure support
set at 15, PEEP of 5.  The Interventional Pulmonology team
notes that Ms. [**Known lastname **] likely needs CPAP following extubation.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has remained cardiovascularly
stable.  Throughout her hospital stay, she has had several
episodes of hypertension.  Her atenolol dose of 50 mg per day
was changed to 75 mg twice a day during her hospitalization.
Heart rate and blood pressure have both remained stable.  She
has had constant blood pressure monitoring with an arterial
line while in the Intensive Care Unit.

3.  Infectious Disease:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has had multiple sputum
and bronchial cultures and Gram stains performed during the
course of her hospital stay.  Her sputum has grown out
gram-positive cocci, consisting of a staphylococcus aureus
species, and a beta streptococcus.  These species have not
been further delineated with specificities to date.  She has
been placed on antibiotic therapy, including Levaq
