History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 3234**] is a 66 year old female who underwent CABG x 4 on
[**2104-7-24**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She did receive a tracheal stent
pre-operatively for tracheobronchomalacia.  She was extubated on
POD 4.  Post-op course was complicated by rapid atrial
fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and lopressor.
She did convert to sinus rhythm prior to discharge.
Additionally, she developed persistent fevers and leukocytosis.
She was placed on Vancomycin and Bactrim for UTI and MRSA in the
sputum.  She was discharged to rehab on POD 10 on Levaquin.  The
patient returned to clinic on [**8-6**] and was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
sternal drainage.  She was found to have a sternal click at this
time.  Drainage was minimal and she returned to rehab with
betadine swabs and strict sternal precautions.  Following
discussion this morning between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the rehab physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 35173**], the patient will be readmitted with plan to debride
the sternum in the am.

AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 67 year old woman s/p sternal
debridement
Final Report: SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST
REASON FOR EXAM: Status post sternal debridement.
Comparison is made with prior study [**8-21**].
There are low lung volumes. Mild cardiomegaly and widened
mediastinum are
unchanged. Aside from a stable linear atelectasis in the left
base, the lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. Dobbhoff tube is coiled in the stomach. Right PICC
line is in place.

Date: [**2104-8-25**]  SWALLOWING FOLLOW UP:
INTERIM HISTORY:
This 67 y/o female admitted [**2104-8-12**] for sternal debridement, to
OR [**8-13**] and [**8-16**] for debridement and flap placement, extubated
[**8-20**]. Seen by our department on [**8-21**] recommended NPO.  [**8-22**] pt
cautiously advanced to small volumes of pureed solids and nectar
thick liquids, but due to fatigue/lethargy, recommended to keep
Dobbhoff as primary nutrition, hydration, and medication.  On
thick liquids.  On [**8-24**] Dobbhoff pulled, as it was kinked.  We
were asked by RN staff this morning to reassess prior to d/c to
rehab.  However, pt initially was noted by RN to have fatigue,
coughing, and nausea, so she was inappropriate for eval.
Returned later this morning and pt feeling better.
S: "YUCK! Why does it taste like that?"
O: Pt seated upright in bed, offered items from her breakfast
tray including pureed toast, pureed eggs, and cream of wheat.
Also offered thin liquids by cup/straw, ice, and [**Location (un) **] cracker.

Oral phase remarkable for prolonged but functional mastication
of
cracker.  Laryngeal elevation adequate and timely to palpation.
No throat clearing, coughing, choking, or vocal quality changes.

Pt's O2 sats stable at 93-95% throughout eval with humidified
air
near but not on face via shovel mask.
A: SUMMARY
Pt presents without s/sx of aspiration.  Fatigue appears
improved
from our previous evaluation, though may continue to be a
limiting factor to PO intake, per discussion with RN staff.
Recommend diet upgrade to soft solids and thin liquids with PO
meds whole as tolerated with thin liquids.  This is pt's
baseline
diet.  She'll require supervision/assistance with meals to
maintain standard aspiration precautions.  Recommend f/u by
Nutrition either here or in LTAC setting to provide oral vs.
non-oral supplementation based on volume of PO intake.  Intake
is
expected to be better with new diet than it was on the
puree/nectar diet which was unappetizing.
P: RECOMMENDATIONS
1. PO diet: soft solids, thin liquids
2. PO meds whole with thin liquids
3. TID oral care
4. Assist with meals to maintain standard aspiration
precautions,
encourage volume of intake.
5. Nutrition f/u here or in LTAC setting to continue to provide
oral vs. non-oral supplements as needed based on volume of PO
intake.
6. Please reconsult/page if we can be of further assistance.
