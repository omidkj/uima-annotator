History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77 yo woman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2166**] with 2 of 3 grafts

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 77 yo woman with CAD s/p CABG in [**2166**] with 2 of 3 grafts
restenosed who presented to an OSH with chest pain.  She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], requiring intubation, atropine,
dopamine, and IVF's en route. In the ED, she was given IVFs,
Dopamine, heparin, and lasix.  Her hypotension was thought to be
secondary to decreased CO prior to her interventional cath. An
ABG  revealed 7.16/69/323.  An echo done in the ED revealed no
evidence of tamponade with global hypokinesis of her LV. ECG
revealed LBBB and was uninterpretable.  She was taken to the
cath lab.

1. CAD. Pt had a trop of 0.2 prior to cath with CKs of 191,163,
and 186. Her cath revealed: LAD: 30% prox, 90% distal, 60% 1st
sm diag, LCx: 90% OM1 at origin, 90% OM1 mid, RCA: 50% prox, 50%
mid, 80% distal, 99% PDA, SVG: OM w/ 90% long restenosis in
Cypher Stents, vein to postlat, RCA: patent w/ patent stent
prox. Angioplasty of her OM graft was performed with a 4.0
balloon. Initial hemodymanics in the MICU: PA 35/16, PCWP 16, CO
4.5, CI 2.6, SVR 852, SvO2 66%.  The patient was started on
Integrelin for 18 hours, ASA, plavix, lipitor, and Metoprolol
titrated to 50 [**Hospital1 **] post procedure.  The following day she was
noted to have a new femoral bruit over her right groin at the
cath site. An U/S of the area was neg for an AV fistula or
pseudoaneurysm. The patient was scheduled to have brachytherapy
prior to discharge however the procedure was postponed to a
later date if indicated at that time.  The pt will follow-up
with her outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

2. Respiratory Failure thought to be secondary to CHF.
Aspiration PNA was considered, however felt to be unlikely given
lack of infiltrates on CXR and improvement of symptoms w/o Abx.
Pt was successfully extubated after aggressive diuresis with
lasix.

3. CHF. The pt improved clinically with diuresis (net neg 1.3 L)
and angioplasty.  Her swan pressures were WNL prior to removal.
She continued to diurese with lasix. She was initially started
on captopril 25 tid, then changed to lisinopril 40 prior to
discharge. She was not restarted on Isosobide Dinitrate
secondary to her relatively low [**Name (NI) **]. She should be resarted as
an outpatient if indicated to help control preload.

5. Bandemia. [**Hospital **] hospital day #2 and she remained afebrile.
 The pt's hypotebsion appeared to be due to depressed cardiac
output and not septic shock.  Bld and Urine Cx's were negative
and her CXR was w/o infiltrates.

6. ARF. (Baseline creat 0.9 - 1.2.)  Cr increased to 1.6 w/
diuresis, most likely secondary to prerenal.  Creat decreased to
1.4 prior to discharge.

7. Amemia. Pt required 2 Units of PRBS for a hct of 25.8.
Etiology most likely secondary to procedure and oozing of blood
from her right internal jugular line. Her post transfusion hct
was 31.6. Her hct remained stable over the rest of her hospital
stay and therefore, we did not feel it was indicated to check a
CT of her Right groin for a retroperitoneal bleed. Pt reports a
h/o chronic amenia of unkown origin requiring iron
supplemenation, which was continued during her hospital stay.
