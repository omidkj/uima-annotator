HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 70 year old white female
has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and smoking and has had one week of
upper abdominal epigastric pain.  She woke on the a.m. of
admission acutely dyspneic and called an ambulance and was
transferred to [**Hospital6 3872**].  An
electrocardiogram revealed new Q waves across the precordium
with ST elevations.  She was placed on BiPAP for respiratory
distress and received Lasix, Nitroglycerin drip, Integrilin,
Heparin, Aspirin and a beta blocker.  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization and was transferred to the catheterization
laboratory.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Glucotrol XL 1000 mg p.o. once daily.
2. Glucophage 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
3. Lipitor 40 mg p.o. once daily.
4. Avapro.
5. Aspirin.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Noninsulin dependent diabetes
mellitus.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Hypertension.

History of atrial fibrillation fifteen years ago and was
cardioverted.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She smoked two packs a day for many years
and quit three years ago.  She does not drink alcohol.  She
lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Nonfocal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she is an
elderly white female in no apparent distress.  Heart rate is
92, respiratory rate 14, blood pressure 106/65.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat examination is normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Extraocular movements are intact.  The
oropharynx is benign.  The neck was supple with full range of
motion.  No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids are two
plus and equal bilaterally without bruits.  The lungs are
clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular
examination is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 with
no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, with positive bowel sounds, no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were without cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.  Pulses were two plus and equal
bilaterally throughout.  Neurologic examination was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was taken immediately to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory where cardiac catheterization
revealed left ventricle  one plus mitral regurgitation and an
ejection fraction of 25 percent with a hyperdynamic base and
an extensive area of anterior and inferoapical dyskinesis.
The left main had an 80 percent stenosis, left anterior
descending coronary artery had a 90 percent stenosis, 70
percent midstenosis, and 99 percent midstenosis.  The left
circumflex had a 40 percent midstenosis.  Right coronary
artery had an 80 percent midstenosis, 70 percent midstenosis
and she had an intraaortic balloon placed at the time.  On
[**2128-5-18**], she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times
three with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending coronary artery, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal and right coronary artery, cross time was 58
minutes, total bypass time 72 minutes.  She was transferred
to the CSRU on Epinephrine, Neo-Synephrine and Propofol.  She
had a stable postoperative night and was extubated on
postoperative day number one.  She remained on her
Epinephrine and that was weaned off on postoperative day
number one.  She then went into atrial fibrillation on
postoperative day number one and was started on Amiodarone
and was given Lopressor.  She blocked down and was seen by
electrophysiology who recommended the Amiodarone and wanted
to evaluate her for an ICD.  She was changed to oral
Amiodarone on postoperative day number two.  She had her
chest tubes discontinued on postoperative day number three.
She required aggressive respiratory therapy.  She was
improving and she was anticoagulated with Heparin as she was
going in and out of atrial fibrillation.  On [**2128-5-23**], she
went to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where she was
inducible but it could have been because the Amiodarone was
in the proarrhythmic phase or because they did aggressive
induction, but at that point, they decided to wait on ICD and
she will return to the Electrophysiology Laboratory in four
weeks for question of placement of an ICD.  She was started
on Coumadin and she was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number seven.  She continued to progress
and was discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative day
number nine in stable condition.

Her laboratories on discharge were white blood cell count
9.5, hematocrit 33.1, platelet count 231,000.  Sodium 142,
potassium 4.2, chloride 107, CO2 25, blood urea nitrogen 20,
creatinine 1.3, blood sugar 182 with an INR of 2.3

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Potassium 20 mEq p.o. twice a day times ten days.
2. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
4. Tylenol p.r.n.
5. Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n. pain.

10.      Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. twice a day for one week and
   then 400 mg p.o. once daily for a week and then 200 mg
   p.o. once daily.
11.      Flovent two puffs twice a day.
12.      Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice a day for ten days.
13.      Coumadin as directed for an INR goal of 2.0 to 2.5.
