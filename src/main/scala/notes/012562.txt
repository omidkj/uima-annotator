HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 40563**] is a 69-year-old
female with diabetes who initially presented to [**Hospital6 4874**] with shortness of breath, cough, diarrhea
and vomiting.  She was also hypotensive with a systolic blood
pressure of 70.  She was started on a dopamine drip at the
outside hospital.  She was noted to have a pandemia with 8.8
white blood cells, 65% neutrophils, 19% bands and a chest
x-ray with a right upper lobe infiltrate.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.

At time of arrival here, she was on a dopamine drip and with
saturations in the low 90s on six liters 02 by nasal cannula.
Her hypotension was presumed due to sepsis.  She remained on
pressors, initially dopamine and then Neo-Synephrine until
hospital day number four.  [**5-4**] blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **] subsequently grew streptococcus pneumonia.

She was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, continued on pressors and started on levofloxacin and
vancomycin.  Her antibiotic regimen was later changed to
ampicillin when sensitivities returned on her blood cultures.
On hospital day number three, she was intubated for
respiratory distress.  Her preintubation arterial blood gas
was 7.34/43/73 and a chest x-ray showed interstitial edema
and increasing bilateral effusions in addition to her
pneumonia.

A diagnostic thoracentesis was performed which showed an
uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion.  She was extubated two
days later.  She did have a subsequent episode of dyspnea and
desaturation later that day and her chest x-ray showed
congestive heart failure.  Her symptoms and saturations
improved significantly with Lasix diuresis. She was
subsequently transferred to a Medicine Floor for further
management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.5.  Blood pressure
120/60.  Heart rate 90.  Respiratory rate 28.  94% on five
liters nasal cannula.  In general, appearing fatigued in no
respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Oropharynx clear.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy,
thyromegaly or masses.  Lungs:  Scant crackles bilaterally,
[**3-5**] of the way up, right greater than left.  Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no
hepatosplenomegaly, no masses, normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema, 1+ distal pulses.  Neurological:
Grossly nonfocal, 5/5 strength bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 12.7, hematocrit 31,
platelets 344,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 5, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 13, creatinine .3, glucose 98.  Arterial
blood gas 7.42/45/73.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Pulmonary:  Patient admitted with pneumococcal pneumonia
from outside hospital.  He was intubated during hospital stay
for respiratory distress due to fluid overload and congestive
heart failure.  Please see history of present illness for
details of Medical Intensive Care Unit course.  Patient
improved with Lasix diuresis.  Her oxygen requirement
improved, however, she will be discharged on two liters nasal
cannula.  She was initially treated with levofloxacin and
vancomycin for pneumonia.  Her antibiotic regimen was changed
to ampicillin and then dicloxacillin subsequently.

2.  Infectious Disease:  Patient with pneumococcal pneumonia
as stated above.  Patient presented with hypotension,
presumed due to septic shock.  Please see history of present
illness for details of Medical Intensive Care Unit course.
She was on pressors during the initial part of her
hospitalization with subsequent improvement in her
hemodynamic status.

3.  Cardiac:  Patient presented with no known cardiac
history, however, was intubated for pulmonary edema.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal ejection
fraction.  She had good results with Lasix diuresis.  Her ACE
inhibitor was initially held on admission due to hypotension
and was subsequently restarted when she was called out to the
floor.

4.  Hematology:  Patient with chronic anemia.  Iron studies
were consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with VNA and home
oxygen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Pneumonia.
