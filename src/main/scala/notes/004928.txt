Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
L sided numbness and collapse

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MRI/MRA
CTA


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 88yo R-handed man with asthma who is
transferred from Worcerster (ST. Vincents) after he received iv
tPA for a stroke, due to lack of availability of ICU bed
available in  [**Hospital1 1559**].

He was fine this am when he woke up. While making breakfast at
8.45 am, he all of a sudden noted numbness throughout his L-leg
and L-arm. His face felt fine. He slumped to the floor. He did
not have tingling, and denies weakness. He felt lightheaded at
the time. This has since resolved. He was able to get to the
phone with some effort to call 911, and was brought to OSH.

NIHSS at OSH was 12 (2 for facial, 3 for L arm, 4 for L leg, 1
for atxia, senosry and dysarthria each). FS was 110, BP 144/91.
CT head was normal apart from small amount of atrophy. Iv tPA
was
given at 11.27 (5.8mg as bolus then 52 mg in remaining hour). He
was then transferred here and remained stable throughout
transport.

He has not been able to move his L-leg and arm and he continues
to have a L-facial droop. His Language has been fine. Sensation
on the L-side (arm and leg) is impaired as well.

ROS:
denies any fever, chills, weight loss, visual changes, hearing
changes, headache, neckpain, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia,
bowel-bladder dysfunction, chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, or bright red blood per
rectum.

ECG
Baseline artifact.Sinus rhythm. Complete right bundle-branch
block with
right axis deviation. Possible underlying inferior Q wave
myocardial
infarction. Probable left atrial abnormality. Non-specific ST-T
wave changes could be due to ischemia, etc. with biphasic T
waves in lead V3. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2194-3-2**] no
diagnostic change.

[**2194-2-28**]
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, mass,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures.There is
loss of grey-white differentiation in right posterior frontal
lobe indicative od early infarct.
Areas of hypoattenuation are seen within the periventricular and
subcortical white matter reflecting chronic microvascular
disease. Mucosal thickening is seen within the left maxillary
and ethmoid sinuses. The remainder of the paranasal sinuses
remain normally aerated. No osseous abnormalities are detected.
Calcific density is seen within the left frontal region
posterior to the orbit, likely a chronic finding.
IMPRESSION: Early infarct right posterior frontal lobe at the
convexity. No intra- or extra- axial hemorrhage.

CTA
1. Evolving right parietal lobe infarction. Attenuation of
branches of the superior right middle cerebral artery supplying
this region. No significant stenosis or aneurysm involving the
major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**].
2. Atherosclerotic disease involving the common carotid
bifurcations bilaterally without evidence of hemodynamically
significant stenosis. 5-mm intraluminal thrombus identified
within the right internal carotid artery just distal to the
bifurcation.
3. Medialization of the right vocal cord with enlargement of the
piriform sinus suggestive of right vocal cord paresis. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
4. Degenerative changes within the cervical spine with
anterolisthesis of C3 on C4 and C4 on C5.

[**2194-3-4**]
CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures. Again noted, an area of hypoattenuation
within the high right parietal lobe consistent with evolving
infarction involving the right middle cerebral and anterior
cerebral arteries. Motion artifact degrades the quality of
study. Again noted, large fat containing cystic structure within
the occipital scalp likely represents a sebaceous cyst.
Visualization of the paranasal sinuses demonstrate mild mucosal
thickening involving the left maxillary sinus.
IMPRESSION: Evolving right parietal lobe infarction. No evidence
of intracranial hemorrhage. No evidence of new strokes.

[**2194-2-28**] L wrist plain films:
IMPRESSION: Severe diffuse osteopenia limits sensitivity for
detecting acute fracture. Deformity of the distal radius and
proximal carpal rows is likely secondary to changes from chronic
osteoarthritis, however an acute on chronic injury is not
entirely excluded.

[**2194-3-3**]
CXR Probable LLL pneumonia

Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid

inferolateral/inferior akinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is  mildly depressed. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular  filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There  is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve  leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
