Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4963**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental Status Changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- intubation
- central line placement
- a-line placement

History of Present Illness:
64 year old women with history of mental retardation, MRSA
pneumonia, bipolar disorder and CHF presenting with a five day
history weakness, tremors and altered mental status. She feels
her symptoms began three weeks ago when she was started on
metformin and glipizide for DM control. She was taken off these
medications three days prior to admission. She describes tremors
and a fear of falling which have left her bed bound for the last
five days. She feels generally weak and has been having diarrhea
and polyuria. Her po intake has also decreased over the last
week. Per her and her caregivers, she has been increasingly
confused and agitated as well. Her PCP recommended coming to the
ED for evaluation.
.
In the ED, vitals were 98.1, BP 101/57, HR 74, R 18, 96% RA. FS
was 118. Labs demonstrated Lithium level 2.2, hyperkalemia,
hyponatremia and acute renal failure. She was given kayexelate,
insulin and glucose for her hyperkalemia with slight improvement
to 6.0. She had a transient hypotensive episode to SBP 89/33 and
received a 500 cc bolus and 8 mg IV Decadron for presumed
adrenal insufficiency. She responded and did not require any
further BP support. She received levofloxacin, flagyl and
vancomycin given leukocytosis and relative hypotension and was
transferred to the MICU for furhter monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64F h/o bipolar on lithium, MR, CHF, DM2, admitted with
ARF, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, elevated lithium level, now
attempting to wean off vent.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt with chronic respiratory
acidosis likely [**1-20**] OSA/pulmonary HTN, asthma. In setting of ARF
[**1-20**] diarrhea, poor PO, likely triggered inability to eliminate
H+ and related worsening uncompensated respiratory acidosis.
Goal pCO2 = 65, as pt is likely obligate rapid shallow breather
at baseline given obesity. Attempt wean to PS 8/PEEP 8, with
diuresis to improve respiratory mechanics.
- First few days of ICU admission pt. was maintained on home
regimen of CPAP while sleeping and nasal cannula / room air
while awake
- [**Hospital **] hospital day 4 pt. with increasing somnolence and
increased positive fluid balance as renal function worsened and
thus increased biPAP requirement -> pCO2 continued to climb and
pt. intubated. Pt. underwent slow wean over the next 2 weeks ->
coupled with return of renal function, subsequent diuresis, and
treatment of MSSA pneumonia -> pt. completed 14 day course of
Vancomycin as she has pcn allergy
- [**9-19**] extubated in am and doing well -> tolerating CPAP
overnight and NC during the day.
Pt reports being complaint at home with her nebulizer, CPAP as
well as O2 nasal canula. During the day she uses her O2 by NC
most of the time.
.
# Acute renal failure: Cr 1.3, with baseline 0.8-1.0.
- Cr elevated on admission and 18-24 hours later pt. stopped
making urine.  Renal was consulted and initially pt did not
respond to lasix.  During this time pt. given some fluids and
kidneys slowly recovered on their own.  Pt. had Cr. back to
normal level and we started lasix -> now Cr stable at 1.3, pt.
making adequate amounts of urine and processing meds
appropriately
-Initially held further diuresis as overall fluid balance per
physical exam seemed to be even. Diuresis started with 20 mg
lasix PO on medical floor again as pt's renal function o
baseline. Pt need weekly check of her renal function as long as
Lithium treatment continues.
.
# Intermittent low - grade temps: vancomycin as above [**1-20**] sputum
MSSA. Completed full 5 day azithromycin course. pt. had central
venous line placed which was removed once 14 day course of vanco
was complete. She remained afebrile after above.
.
# Bipolar d/o: Titrated lithium per ARF, now at lithium 150mg
QHS, with quetiapine 100mg PO TID, quetiapine 350mg PO HS.
Lithium level was elevated on arrival - 2.0 and psych / renal
advised that HD was not needed for lithium. We held lithium
until level was <1.0 with return of renal function. Restarted
lithium and following daily levels. Pt. will need to follow-up
with primary psychiatrist for further medication alterations. Pt
needs 2-3 times weekly Lithium levels check until stabilized on
this regiment for 3-4 weeks,.
.
# CHF: continued with lasix 20 mg daily as above
.
# DM2: Continued on humalog insulin SS q6h.  Pt. with history of
reaction to oral hypoglycemics. Pt refused taking oral
antidiabetic but is now agreeing to take glipizide 2.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Will need follow-up with PCP and further dose adjustment.
Uncertain about capacity to learn how to use insulin.
.
# Asthma: Continued on home regimen of albuterol and
ipratropium.
.
# Decubitus ulcer -> on air mattress for much of her icu stay.
sacral decub dressed daily - stage I.
.
# FEN: [**Doctor First Name **] diet
