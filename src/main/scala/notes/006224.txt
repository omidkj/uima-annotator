Brief Hospital Course:
On the day of presentation Mrs. [**Known lastname 88362**] was taken emergently to
the operating room for left above knee guillotine amputation,
left flank incision and debridement.  Postoperatively she was
admitted to the CVICU in unstable condition with a substantial
pressor requirement. Her abdomen was debrided, infectious
disease, nephrology and acute care surgery consults were
obtained. She was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics and
wound cultures grew out group A strep. She had repeated
debridements of both her abdomen and LLE wounds but failed to
improve. Her acidosis and pressor requirement persistent and she
was placed on renal replacement therapy with mild improvement.
On hospital day 4 a discussion was held with the family given
her worsening condition and dismal prognosis. They decided that
in this circumstance the patient would have wished to be CMO.
Pressor support was withdrawn and she expired soon thereafter.
