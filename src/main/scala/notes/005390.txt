Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p unwitnessed fall at home on
[**2200-4-22**]. In the ER he was evalauted and admitted to the ICU
after beign foudn to have a L SDH, R SAH, and Bialteraly IPH's
left > right.  On [**4-23**] there was a family meeting to discuss
hisprognosis which was grim.  no more Head CT's were planned to
be done per family wishes and secodnary to prognosis.  On [**4-24**]
he was transferred to the floor.  At that time he had no eye
openeing, his pupils weer sluggish and he had no corneal
reflexes.  his RUE minimally localized which was a change in
exam as he had been spontaneously moving it prior.  His LUE was
0/5 throughout, his RLE was triple flexion, and his LLE
minimally responded to stimulation.  On [**4-25**] his blood sugars
were up to 330 and a sliding scale was initiated.  The family at
this time also communicated that they would not want him to get
tube feedings or TPN.  Social work met with the family and
recommneded palliative care see the pt.  Pallaitive care
recommended hospice vs nursing home.  The family initially
seemed open to the idea of hospice but on [**4-26**] when the
representative from [**Hospital **] arrived they did not wish to
meet with them.  Also on [**4-26**] another meeting was held between
socail work and neurosurgery with the family to reiterate the
grim prognosis and attempt to better devise a plan of care as we
moved forward.  they relayed they wanted to wait for family to
arrive to maker any final decisions and would keep him DNR/DNI
and make decisions of care as they arose.  On [**4-27**] his sodium
was elevated to 153 and discussion as to the required
itnervention, nasogastric tube placement with free water and
tube feed administration, was discussed and the family decided
that they were not interested in this therapy.  On the mornign
fo [**4-28**] the family decided to make him comfort measures only and
palliative care was contact[**Name (NI) **] to meet with the family.  After
discussion of plan of care to aid in keeping him comfortbale the
emasures were initiated. very shortly there after he was turned
on his side to aid in positioning and a moderate amount of
secretions came out of his mouth.  he shortly there after passed
away quietly with his family at the bedside.
