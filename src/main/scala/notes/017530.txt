Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2128-3-24**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Valve)

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66956**] is a 56 yo man who presents as a transfer after
sustaining a cardiac arrest during an exercise tolerance test.
He reports that at the start of the ETT, he began to get dizzy.
This was followed by chest pain and then LOC. Per report, the pt
was hypotensive and bradycardic, then had an asystolic arrest.
He fell onto the treadmill. CPR was initiated, and the pt had
rapid ROSC (3-5 minutes). By the time of EMS arrival, he was
awake and alert. Upon arrival to the OSH, he was in atrial
fibrillation with RVR. He received a total of 20 mg of IV
metoprolol and converted to sinus rhythm. He underwent pan-CT
scan, which did not demonstrate any significant injuries. He was
transiently on a heparin drip.  An echocardiogram reportedly
demonstrated [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8 cm2 with a peak gradient of 62 mm Hg
and a mean gradient of 41 mmHg. He reports worsening exercise
tolerance and progressive exertional angina over the past few
months. He had a nose bleed after his arrest today, but has
otherwise not had any bleeding events.

[**2128-3-22**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography of this left dominant system revealed 1
vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was short and had no
angiographically apparent coronary disease. The LAD had a 90%
stenosis proximal to the prior Cypher stents. The remainder of
the LAD was without angiographically significant disease. The
LCX was patent but there was a 30-40% stenosis at the origin of
OM1. The RCA was small and without significant disease. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right-sided
filling pressures and moderately elevated left-sided filling
pressures. The RA mean was 21 mm Hg, RVEDP 21 mm Hg, PASP 47 mm
Hg with a mean of 33 mm Hg, and a PCWP of 21 mm Hg. The cardiac
output was 5.0 and index 2.3 l/min/m2. 3. Left ventriculography
was deferred. 4. The aortic valve was not crossed as it was
known to be critically stenosed.

[**2128-3-22**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Less than 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid
arteries.

[**2128-3-23**] Chest CT Scan:
1. Thoracic aorta normal in caliber throughout, without evidence
of aneurysm. Aortic diameter measurements are listed above. 2.
Multiple noncalcified sub 5 mm pulmonary nodules are seen
throughout the lungs. Recommend follow up in one year. 3. Subtle
bronchial irregularities, compatible with chronic airway
disease. 4. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Normal
cardiac size. Calcified aortic valves. Stent in proximal LAD.

Conclusions
A patent foramen ovale is present. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate
([**12-19**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
pericardial effusion.

PRELIMINARY REPORT Not reviewed/approved by the Attending
Anesthesia Physician.

POSTBYPASS
Patient is on a phenylephrine infusion. A well seated, well
functioning mechanical valve seen in the aortic position. No
perivalvular leaks. Max grad is 50 mmHg with a mean gradient of
36 mmHg. LV looks underfilled. LV EF is similar at 60%. Aortic
contour is smooth after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66956**] was admitted to the medical ICU. Cardiac
biomarkers were initially elevated but improved over several
days. He remained stable on medical therapy. On [**3-20**], he
underwent cardiac catheterization whgich revealed AS and LAD
disease.Referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and underwent surgery on [**3-24**].
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on titrated
propofol and phenylephrine drips. Extubated the following
morning. Went back into A fib and was treated with amiodarone.
Chest tubes removed on POD #2.Transferred to floor on POD #4 to
begin increasing his activity level. Coumadin anticoagulation
started for intermittent A fib. EP consulted and amiodarone
discontinued with further titration of beta blockade. Cleared
for discharge to home on POD #9. Target INR 2.0-2.5. Coumadin to
be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29070**].
