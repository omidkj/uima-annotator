HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old female
with multiple medical problems including atrial fibrillation
on Coumadin, anemia, who presented to the Emergency
Department on [**11-5**] with a two day history of bright red
blood per rectum.  The patient stated that she had several
episodes of blood per rectum in the past but all had resolved
spontaneously.  She also complained of abdominal pain but
denied having any nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness or
syncope.  She also reported increasing fatigue in recent
weeks.  The patient rejected NG lavage and was transferred to
the floor and placed on Telemetry.

Shortly after arrival to the floor, the patient had two
episodes of dark grossly melanotic stool, each approximately
150 cc in volume.  The patient subsequently decompensated
after her second bowel movement with a blood pressure drop
down to 82/46 and an increasing heart rate to 110 beats per
minute as well as increasing respiratory rates and
decreasing oxygen saturation down to 80%.  The patient also
complained of chest pain and diaphoresis.

The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen by nasal
cannula yet continued to desaturate and was immediately
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  In the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient started to vomit bright red
blood and continued to desaturate on a non-rebreather.  The
patient was successfully intubated to protect her airway.
