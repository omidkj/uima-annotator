Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
DVT/PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
status post mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis
status post IVC filter placement
intracardiac echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
67 yo male with past medical history significant for LLE DVT
trasnferred for recently found pulmonary embolism and right
ventricle intracardiac thrombus.
.
On [**12-28**] pt had minor shoulder surgery, was not immobile, did not
take plane trip or long car ride, but developed LLE swelling and
pain and was diagnosed with DVT of femoral and popliteal vein on
[**1-21**].  Pt began taking coumadin and lovenox.  Over next few
days, pt developed mild shortness of breath and darting chest
pains.  Seen by PCP where he was found to be tachycardic and
mildly dyspneic so sent to ED.  In ED, CTA revealed several
small left pulmonary embolus and echo showed small free floating
intracardiac thrombus without signs of right heart strain.
Troponins were negative.  ECG unremarkable.  CBC and BMP were
WNL.  Pt trasnferred for possible IVC placement and RV
embolectomy
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt denies CP, SOB, pleurisy,
lightheadedness, dizziness, cough, previous history of PE.
Notes that he has been active with good appetitie and no recent
weight loss.  Had colonscopy few years ago which was normal.
Had PSA few months ago which was 2.4 and pt with known BPH.  Pt
denies history of easy bruising or bleeding.  Notes his last DVT
occurred after surgery, pna, and 13 hour plane ride.  Does have
fhx significant for clotting as mom had post surgical PE.  No hx
of stroke, recent bleeding.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
75%). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2185-1-29**]
FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates diffuse increase in
echogenicity, consistent with fatty infiltration. However, other
forms of liver disease are not excluded. No focal liver lesions
or biliary dilatation is seen. The common bile duct is normal
measuring 3 mm. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy. The right and left kidneys measure 12.0 and
13.5 cm,
respectively. No hydronephrosis, stones, or renal masses are
seen. The
spleen is mildly enlarged measuring 16.1 cm. The pancreas and
midline
structures are obscured by overlying bowel gas.

COLOR DOPPLER AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS: The main, anterior right,
posterior
right and left portal vein demonstrate normal directional flow
and waveforms.  The right, middle and left hepatic veins
demonstrate normal directional flow and waveforms. The main
hepatic artery is patent.

Doppler evaluation of the main and segmental renal arteries of
the upper, mid, and lower poles of both kidneys were performed.
There is normal arterial waveform with sharp systolic upstroke
and mildly decreased diastolic flow.  The resistive indices are
within the normal range.

IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration. However,
other forms of liver disease including advanced liver disease or
cirrhosis is not excluded.
2. Mild splenomegaly.
3. Patent hepatic vasculature.
4. Normal sized kidneys, without evidence of hydronephrosis or
renal artery stenosis.

[**2185-1-28**]
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and
Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral,
popliteal, and calf veins were obtained. There is occlusive
thrombus originating at the junction of the left common femoral
vein and greater saphenous vein extending inferiorly to involve
the entire left superficial femoral and left popliteal veins.
Some flow is seen within the left calf, though the posterior
tibial and peroneal veins were not discretely identified. There
is normal flow, compressibility and augmentation of all the
right-sided veins.

IMPRESSION:
1. Occlusive thrombus extending from the left common femoral
vein to the
popliteal vein. Some flow is seen within the left calf veins,
though they
were incompletely evaluated.
2. Patent venous vasculature in the right lower extremity.
