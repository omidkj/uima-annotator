Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed. MRSA bacteremia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), [**2132-4-24**]
-PICC line, [**2132-5-2**]


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 76318**] is a 74 year old woman with past medical
history significant for rheumatoid arthritis (on chronic
prednisone), asthma, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, presenting
from rehab facilty after being found to have altered mental
status and bright red blood per rectum.

Per transfer notes, patient was intially taken to [**Hospital 1474**]
hospital where she was evaluated for abdominal pain. Vitals on
arrival 94/52, 83, 14, 98 F. Given her altered mental status, CT
head was performed with preliminary read raising the question of
a basal ganglia hemorrhage.  Labs there revealed AST 103 / ALT
112, Ap 451, T bili 3.0 and D bili 2.1. Patient was transferred
for further management of suspected intracraneal hemorrhage.

In our ED, 98.2, 110/63, 85, 22 100% 4L NC. Patient underwent
repeat head CT which did not reveal any acute intracraneal
process. Patient was also noted to have two bowel movements with
bright red blood. Labs repeated and given OSH elevation in liver
enzymes and congestive pattern, CT abdomen was performed.
Surgery, GI and ERCP services were [**Name (NI) 653**], and decision was
made to admit patient to ICU for further management.
	
At this time, patient denies any pain or discomfort. She is not
accompanied by family and she reports feeling slightly confused.
She is unable to relate why she was brought to the hospital and

reports some difficulty breathing. Also reports single episode
of vomiting earlier in the week with gastric contents and clear
liquid. She denied any light headedness or palipiations.

[**2132-4-24**]:
EGD: esophageal candidiasis

[**2132-4-28**]:
CT ABD/PELV:
1. Small amount of new perihepatic free fluid.
2. No evidence of obstruction.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis
and/or consolidation of the adjacent lung.
4. Calcified rounded lesion within the uterus, c/w calcified
fibroid.
5. Bilateral renal hypodensities, too small to characterize, may
reflect renal cysts.

[**2132-4-28**]:
ECHO: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Diastolic function could not
be assessed. There is an abnormal systolic flow contour at rest,
but no left ventricular outflow obstruction. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic LV systolic dysfunction with an
abnormal systolic flow contour without LVOT gradient. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
