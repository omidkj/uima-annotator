History of Present Illness:
70 yo woman with h/o CAD, CABG, last DES [**1-17**], IDDM, CKD, CHF
on lasix here from [**Hospital3 4107**] with R sided PNA, NSTEMI. She
reports chest pain, typical for her angina but resistent to SLNG
(5-6 tabs) over the last 5 days (longer duration than normal).
She also c/o dizziness/lightheadedness, nausea/vomitting
(bilious, NB) for the past 2 days, with diarrhea yesterday
(watery, non-bloody, no mucous, but black at baseline given
iron), with no abdominal pain. She notes fever to 102 at home
yesterday. She denies ill contacts, travel, exotic foods. She
does not normally have diarrhea but sometimes can get n/v with
her chest pain. She describes the chest pain as sharp, rated
[**8-22**] yesterday, currently very dull. She notes being seen at [**Hospital1 2177**]
and [**Hospital **] hosp over the past 5 days and told she had
musculoskeletal chest pain. She denied cough to me but did
endorse a feeling of wheezing. She has home oxygen only for
anginal relief and O2 sat monitoring (baseline 95-96% on RA) but
noted decreased O2 sat yesterday to 70's on RA. She was seen at
[**Hospital1 **] [**6-17**], T 101.2 HR 96 RR 18 BP 124/96 Sat 95% NRB, CK 171,
Trop 1.67, WBC 16.3, (N 88, L 5). She was found on CXR with
'right lung white out' and NSTEMI. She was given levofloxacin
500mg iv, compazine iv, 0.5mg ativan, zofran, 1 gm tylenol,
aspirin 325mg, 1" nitro paste.
.
She was then transferred here. VS on arrival T 101, HR 92 BP
158/85, RR 18 Sat 85% on RA. She was given 2.5mg iv metoprolol,
1L NS, 4 gm mag. Her ECG was similar to [**Hospital1 **], but trop
continued to rise. She was started on heparin gtt. Stool guaiac
negative here.
.
ROS: wt stable, no increased swelling, no HA, chronic
(unchanged) photphobia, no neck stiffness, no congestion, denies
cough to me, no orhtopnea, denies palpitation, sore throat,
dysuria, hematuria, rash, + myalgias and chronic joint pain.

Pertinent Results:
PERTINENT LABS:

STUDIES:
CXR [**6-18**]: 1. Focal opacity at right lung base concerning for
pneumonia. 2. Likely mild pulmonary edema. 3. Probable small
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
TTE [**6-18**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the mid- and distal segments of the anterior
wall, and severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal [**2-14**] of the
left ventricle, c/w LAD disease. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30-35%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three moderately thickened aortic
valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
.
BILATERAL LENIS [**6-18**]: No deep vein thrombosis identified in
either leg.
.
CXR [**6-20**]: Significant interval improvement in bilateral perihilar
opacities is consistent with resolution of pulmonary edema.
Still present bibasilar consolidations might represent
atelectasis and/or infectious process as well as there is no
significant change in bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CT TORSO [**6-20**]: 1. Cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural
effusions and mild pulmonary edema. Mild bibasilar atelectasis
vs aspiration.
2. Extensive coronary artery calcification.
3. Normal positioning of lines and tubes.
4. Nonobstructing renal calculus measuring 3 mm in the lower
pole of the right kidney.
5. Extensive mesenteric vascular calcifications and renal
arterial
calcifications.
6. Scoliosis with degenerative changes.
7. Two small pulmonary nodules measuring less than 4mm. One year
follow-up chest CT or comparison with prior outside studies is
recommended.
.
TTE with bubble study [**6-21**]: No obvious intracardiac shunt
detected.
.
CXR [**6-22**]: Combination of bibasilar atelectasis and small right
pleural effusion are unchanged over the past two days. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable though larger today than yesterday
accompanied by increase in caliber of the central pulmonary
arteries and azygos vein, all of which may be due to interval
extubation rather than cardiac decompensation. Left PIC line
ends in the mid-SVC. No pneumothorax.
