Pertinent Results:
[**2106-3-11**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to XX cm from the incisors. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
POST CPB: 1. Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolci function with
background inotropic support. 2. Bioprosthetic valve in aortic
position, Well seated and stable with good leaflet excursion. No
AI and minimal grqadient across the prosthesis. 3. Trace MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 69961**]d tricuspid regurgitation
.
[**2106-3-10**] CT Scan: Severe calcification of the aortic valve.
Moderate hiatal hernia. Evidence of prior granulomatous
infection. Renal cyst. Mild emphysema.
[**2106-3-15**] CXR:

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: A left-sided pacemaker
generator pack
projects leads into the right atrium and ventricle. The patient
is status
post median sternotomy. Again seen is severe left lower lobe
atelectasis,
slightly worse since [**2106-3-13**]. An adjacent small left
pleural
effusion is also increased in size. The remaining lungs appear
well aerated.
There has been interval removal of a right IJ central venous
catheter. There
is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Slightly worsened left lower lobe collapse. Slightly
increased
small left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7173**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-3-10**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve and coronary artery disease.
Heparin was started as he had been off his Coumadin for five
days in anticipation of surgery. A CT scan was performed which
showed severe calcification of the aortic valve a moderate
hiatal hernia, evidence of prior granulomatous infection, a
renal cyst and mild emphysema. On [**2106-3-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 7173**] was taken
to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting LIMA to LAD and an aortic valve replacement using a
23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic Porcine valve. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. EP service consulted on
patient for PPM interrogation. On post-op day one he was started
on beta-blockers and diuretics and was diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. Later on this day he was transferred to the floor
for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. Coumadin was started for his atrial
fibrillation and titrated for goal INR of [**2-18**].5. Renal function
bumped slightly to 1.4 and lasix was changed to pre-op dose of
po lasix from IV with good results. Electrolytes repleted as
needed. His CXR showed LLL collapse and he required CPT and
pulmonary toileting with good effect. He continued to make good
progress while working with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. On post-op day #5 he was discharged to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1683**]
Health Care with the appropriate medications and follow-up
appointments.
