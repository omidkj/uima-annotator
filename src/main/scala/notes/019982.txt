PERTINENT STUDIES:
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2203-9-19**] 8:54 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis to explain the
patient's pain.
2. Stable cardiomegaly.
3. Right renal cyst, stable
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2203-9-19**] 8:53 AM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Please note, MRI is
more sensitive in the detection of intracranial mass lesion.
.
EEG Study Date of [**2203-9-20**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to mild to moderate background
slowing and
disorganization maximal posteriorly with bitemporal at times
theta slowing without clear laterality. No definitive spikes or
other discharging features were seen.
.
L-SPINE (AP & LAT) Study Date of [**2203-9-21**] 2:03 PM
FINDINGS: There is a large bridging osteophyte about the left
aspect of the L2-3 level which obscures the disc space on the
lateral view. There is no definite acute compression fracture.
Question of a spondylytic defect at the L5 level posteriorly is
unchanged from prior. The aorta is densely calcified, but not
aneurysmally enlarged. There are mild degenerative changes of
the hips bilaterally. Note is made of cholecystectomy clips.
Mild irregularity of the right SI joint, likely from
degenerative changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 71 year-old woman with h/o CNS lymphoma,
atrial fibrillation, HTN, presenting with altered mental status,
low-grade fever, hypotension, acute renal failure.
.
# Hypotension: This resolved over the first 24 hours of MICU
course.  Most likely this was secondary to hypovolemia from poor
PO intake.  The patient had been on acetazolamide as an
outpatient per othalmology recommendation, and was NPO for a
procedure the day of admission. Septic shock was considered and
patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics on arrival to
MICU.  These were discontinued on [**9-21**] given negative cultures
and no other evidence of infection.  Random cortisol was
reassuring at 40.  Pulmonary embolus was considered unlikely
less likely given stable vital signs, minimal hypoxia, early
response, no axis change in ECG.  Cardiogenic shock with
ischemia was considered unlikely given stable cardiac enzymes.
The patient's diet was advanced on [**9-21**] as mental status had
returned to baseline.  Anti-hypertensives were initially held,
but amlodipine was restarted prior to discharge.  Her blood
pressure should be measured on discharge and lisinopril can be
restarted if needed.
.
# Change in mental status: Patient had waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status but was minimally alert on arrival, only able to answer
??????no?????? to every question.  Over 48 hours, this improved.  Etiology
was thought to be toxic/metabolic in the setting of multiple
psychoactive drugs, acute renal failure, and baseline po
