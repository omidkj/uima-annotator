male with a history of hypertension who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] last month with shortness of
breath and chest discomfort.  Studies revealed congestive
heart failure and new onset atrial fibrillation.  Over a
1-week hospitalization, he was diuresed and started on daily
Lasix.  He was also cardioverted and started on Coumadin and
amiodarone.  Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
60%, trace aortic insufficiency, and severe 4+ mitral
regurgitation.  He was discharged home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor which showed a heart rate in the 60s.  His beta
blocker was discontinued.  Last week, the patient had one
episode of angina for which he took sublingual nitroglycerin
with relief.  He saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in her office on the day
prior to presentation and was scheduled for cardiac
catheterization.

The cardiac catheterization demonstrated 40% left main
disease with stenosis extending into the left circumflex to a
greater than 85% narrowing, and into the left anterior
descending artery with 70% stenosis.  The right posterior
descending artery had a 90% lesion.  Filling pressures were
within normal limits.  Mitral regurgitation on
catheterization was noted to be mild.  The patient was
admitted to the C-MED Service and cardiothoracic surgery was
consulted.

room air.  Neck revealed no bruits.  No jugular venous

posterior tibialis were 2+ bilaterally.  No pedal edema.  The
feet were warm bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on [**2166-3-7**].

scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft on [**2166-3-10**].

On [**2166-3-10**], the patient underwent a 3-vessel coronary

and pacing wires were removed.  The patient's Lopressor was
increased to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.   Also, on postoperative day
two, the patient was seen by Physical Therapy who thought
that he was at a level III.  Due to his need to ascend three
flights of [**Year (4 digits) 5927**] to live in his apartment, it was suggested
that the patient go to a rehabilitation facility for
recuperation.

The patient was seen again by Physical Therapy on [**2166-3-13**], and at this time he did a level IV; however, he was
still unable to climb [**Last Name (LF) 5927**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the plan was for him to
