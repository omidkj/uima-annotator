Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Transesophageal echocardiogram ([**2155-5-29**])
2. Thoracentesis ([**2155-5-29**])
3. Midline IV ([**2155-5-28**])


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4643**] is a 71 year-old female with a history of CAD/CHF,
recent MVR, among others, presenting with shortness of breath.

Recent hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 94068**]) with the following, brief
course: Initially with respiratory failure (O2 sat in mid 70's
with SBP in 200's; emergently intubated). This was felt to be
multi-factorial (CHF, flash pulmonary edema, pneumonia);
completed 10 days of levofloxacin. Extubated on [**4-22**] without
event. Also had troponin leak in setting of CHF and renal
failure but remained chest pain free during hospitalization. She
underwent cardiac catheterization on [**4-24**] without intervention.


Given severe mitral degenerative disease with MS and MR, felt to
be
contributing to recurrent bouts of CHF requiring
hospitalization, underwent MVR on [**2155-5-5**]. Pre-operatively,
underwent tooth extraction ([**2155-4-28**]) per oral surgery
recommendation. Post-operatively, was volume overloaded
requiring reintubation once and mask ventilation the second
time. Experienced complete heart block after receiving
lopressor; after this did not resolve, a permanent pacemaker was
placed on [**2155-5-13**].

Was discharged on [**2155-5-26**] to rehab.

Awoke this morning and felt short of breath. This did not wake
her out of sleep and did not come on suddenly. She notified
staff and was given 100mg lasix PO at 7am. Also dose with
amiodarone 400mg (known medication) and her home dose of NPH (18
units). Was found to be 85% on 2.5L NC (after started at 97% on
room air) and was therefore sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.

Vitals in the ED showed, T 103.6 (rectal), HR 95, 137/86 -->
182/79, RR 34, 100% on NRS.
.
A PIV could not be placed, so given nitropaste, captopril 6.35mg
SL. Placed on CPAP with 5 PEEP (off at 9:45am). A femoral line
was placed and 80mg IV lasix was given (9am). Nitro gtt started.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn and vancomycin, 1gram and
ceftazidime 1gram were given. Urine output of 225mg in the ED.

Currently, the patient is feeling well. Her SOB is much
improved. Other than the mild SOB, she had no complaints. She
denies chest pain or pressure, palpatations, subjective fever or
any other issues.

Of note, the patient reports having arrived at [**Location (un) **]
yesterday late in the day and she does not belive that she
received her PM doses of medications. There is no recording of
her having gotten her PM dose of glipizide, lasix, metolazone.

EKG ([**2155-5-20**]):
Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Left bundle-branch block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2155-5-16**] ventricular ectopy
is absent and the rate has slowed. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim change.
EKG ([**2155-5-27**]):
Sinus rhythm (92 bpm). LBBB and left axis. Long PR (246ms). No
clear diagnostic ST-T changes.

2D ECHO ([**2155-5-21**]):
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Septal motion is dysnchronous, but the remaining
segments appear to contract well. EF ~40%. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No aortic valve stenosis is seen. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present with normal gradient and mobile leaflets.
No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
2D ECHO ([**2155-5-28**])
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
