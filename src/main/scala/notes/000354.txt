Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Location (un) 1279**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
ECMO

History of Present Illness:
74yo F referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for chest tightness and dyspnea for the
past month. It occurs both at rest and with exertion, related to
stress. She reports associated dizziness. She has episodes [**3-28**]
times per week. They last for a few minutes and resolve when she
lies down and relaxes.

During cardiac catheterization, she clotted off her left
circumflex artery and left anterior descending artery. Patient
became hypotensive requiring atropine and dopamine. Code was
called. Patient required 7 defibrillations.An IABP was placed. A
temporary RV pacing wire was placed. The patient was intubated.

Cardiopulmonary support (ECMO)was initiated via CPS perfusion
catheters placed in the RFA and RFV (the IABP and RV pacing wire
were removed). Access obtained in the LFA and LFV. Emergent
bedside echo showed no evidence of tamponade.She was
successfully resuscitated using CPS with emergent deployment of
drug eluting stents in LAD and LCx(Kissing stenting of the LMCA
into the LAD and LCX ).Patient had resumption of pulsatile
central aortic pressure after stenting of the LAD and LCx. An
IABP was placed.PA cath c/w ischemic MR.

She has massive blood loss during the procedure and has recieved
5U PRBC and 1u platelet prior to transfer to CCU. Echo post cath
showed small pericardial effusion, mild aymmetric LVH, nl LV
size, mildly depressed LVEF

Patient did well in cath lab and ECMO weaned off. Given the ACT
of >900, it was determined to be safer to have the ECMO
catheters removed in OR. Patient went to the OR and vascular
surgery removed the ECMO catheters

Pertinent Results:
-echo [**2127-3-24**]
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. LV appears underfilled.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mild to moderately
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior and inferoseptal akinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed with apical akinesis.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5.The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
7. There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle
consistent with a catheter.



PROCEDURE DATE: [**2127-3-24**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
chest pain
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Acute embolic occlusion of the LCx artery during cardiac
catherization complicated by cardiac arrest requiring initiation
of
cardiopulmonary support.
2. Kissing stenting of the LMCA into the LAD and LCX.
COMMENTS:
1. Initial resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left
sided
filling pressures.
2. Left ventriculography revealed normal systolic function.
3. In preparation for selective coronary angiography, the JL4
was
advanced into the ascending aorta. This was done without
difficulty and
the catheter was cleared and flushed per routine, with contrast
clearing
in the ascending aorta (well outside the sinuses of Valsalva).
The
first puff in the LMCA suggested occlusion of the LCx. The first
cineangiogram showed mild LMCA plaquing with abrupt cutoff and
total
occlusion of the LCx. There was mild diffuse plaqing in the LAD.
4. The patient became progressively bradycardic and hypotensive
(SBP <
40mmHg) and a code was called. Atropine, dopamine and
epinephrine were
given. Chest compressions were started. The patient developed
recurrent VT and VF and the patient was defibrillated at 360J
approximately 7 times. An IABP was placed. A temporary RV pacing
wire
was placed. The patient was intubated.
5. CT surgery was emergently consulted. Cardiopulmonary support
(ECMO)
was initiated via CPS perfusion catheters placed in the RFA and
RFV (the
IABP and RV pacing wire were removed). Access obtained in the
LFA and
LFV. Emergent bedside echo showed no evidence of tamponade.
6. Limited angiography of the RCA showed minimal CAD.
7. Successful kissing stenting of the LAD/LCX back to the ostium
of
the LMCA was performed with a 3.0 x 33 mm Cypher DES (LAD) and
LCX 2.5 x
28 mm Cypher DES (LCX).
8. Patient had resumption of pulsatile central aortic pressure
after
stenting of the LAD and LCx. An IABP was placed.
9. HCt from ABG 20%. Transfusion with emergency release blood
products
was begun.
10. PA catheterization was performed via the LFV. It showed a
marked
increase in filling pressures (RA mean 23mmHg, PCWP mean 40 with
tall
v-waves and rounded dicrotic notch on PA pressure tracing.
Findings
consistent with iscehmic mitral regurgitation.
11. Repeat emergent echo showed a small pericardial space,
posterobasal
hypokinesis and a hyperdynamic anterior wall with moderate
mitral
regurgitation.
12. Hand injection of the LFA showed no obvious major
extravasation.
13. Vascular surgery consulted (together with CT surgery)
regarding
weaning of CPS and removal of CPS catheter

CT abdomen and pelvis [**2127-3-25**]:

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are bilateral pleural
effusions and
bibasilar collapse/consolidation. An NG tube is noted coiled
within the
stomach. The inflated portion of the intraaortic balloon pump
terminates just
above the aortic bifurcation. Note is made of a non-calcified
gallstone.
There is biliary excretion of previously administered contrast.
The liver is
unremarkable on this noncontrast study. The adrenal glands,
pancreas,
kidneys, spleen, and intraabdominal loops of bowel are
unchanged. There is
high attenuation fluid in the anterior and posterior pararenal
spaces
consistent with hemorrhage. There is perihepatic ascites. No
pathologically
enlarged lymph nodes are identified.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is diffuse stranding
in the
subcutaneous tissues in the left groin with obliteration of the
normal fat
planes with asymmetry with expansion of the anterior thigh
musculature
consistent with a hematoma. There is low-density free pelvic
fluid. A Foley
catheter is noted in the bladder. There is sigmoid
diverticulosis, without
evidence of diverticulitis.

Bone windows reveal no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci. There
are
degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:

1) Left groin hematoma.
2) Retroperitoneal hemorrhage as described above.
3) Apparent low position of intraaortic balloon pump terminating
with its
inflated portion just above the aortic bifurcation.

Echo [**2127-3-28**]:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. No left ventricular aneurysm
is seen. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
modertately depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include basal and mid inferior hypokinesis with
basal and mid inferolateral and lateral akinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic
