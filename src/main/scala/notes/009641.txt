HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 year old
gentleman with a history of supraventricular tachycardia,
hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia who was transferred from
[**Hospital 1263**] Hospital to [**Hospital6 256**]
[**2132-11-20**] for failure to wean from ventilator and
persistent fevers.  Please see [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital discharge
summary for further details of his initial presentation and
hospital course there.

In brief, he presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital [**2132-11-8**]
complaining of shortness of breath for two days following a
recent upper respiratory tract infection two weeks prior to
admission.  On admission he was tachypneic to the 40s,
hypoxic to 93% on 100% nonrebreather, tachycardiac to 180 and
hypotensive.  Labs were notable for a white blood count of 5
with 49% neutrophils and 40% bands.  Chest x-ray revealed
left lower lobe and possibly right lower lobe infiltrates.
Blood cultures grew out six out of six bottles with
Streptococcus pneumoniae.  He was begun empirically on Unasyn
and the Azithromycin which was subsequently switched to
Vancomycin when an organism was identified.  On [**11-11**],
he was switched to Penicillin when the organism was found to
be pansensitive.  Despite therapy, he continued to spike
fevers to 101 to 102 on a daily basis despite subsequent
cultures being negative.  He had an exhaustive workup for
alternative etiology of his persistent fevers including right
upper quadrant ultrasound which was negative for
cholecystitis, lower extremity noninvasives which were
negative for deep vein thrombosis, chest computerized
tomography scan which was negative for empyema.  An
echocardiogram was negative for endocarditis.  He did have a
head computerized axial tomography scan which revealed
sinusitis.  Gram stain and cultures of sputum and nasal swabs
revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so Levofloxacin was added
to his regimen.  On [**11-19**], per Infectious Disease
consult recommendation, Penicillin and Levofloxacin were
discontinued and he was switched to Ceftazidime and
Gentamicin to treat his pneumococcal pneumonia and
Pseudomonas sinusitis.  On the day of transfer, he was also
started on empirically on Flagyl and p.o. Vancomycin for
oppression of Clostridium difficile, however, Clostridium
difficile toxin subsequently returned negative.  Despite all
of these treatments, he continued to spike fevers on a daily
basis.

His hospital course at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] was also notable for
respiratory failure.  He was intubated on admission for
hypoxic respiratory failure which was felt to be due to his
pneumonia, presumably from pneumococcus, although this
organism was never cultured from his sputum, only from his
blood.  It is not clear whether he was attempted to be weaned
from the ventilator, but he required persistent sedation, due
to tachypnea to the 50s and desaturation whenever attempts at
weaning sedation were made.

His tachycardia and hypotension on admission was felt likely
due to sepsis.  His hemodynamics stabilized with fluids,
Dopamine, and antibiotics by hospital day #3 and he was able
to be weaned off of Dopamine at that time.  He ruled out for
a myocardial infarction and echocardiogram [**11-17**]
revealed ejection fraction of 75% with mild left ventricular
hypokinesis.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] [**2132-11-20**] for persistent fevers and inability
to wean from the ventilator.

2.  Hypothyroidism, status post thyroidectomy in [**2120**]

admission Haldol was noted to cause seizures.

1.  Ceftazidime 1 gm intravenously q. 8 hours (day #2)
2.  Gentamicin 160 mg intravenously q. 12 hours (day #2)
3.  Vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q. 6 hours, (day #1)
4.  Flagyl 500 mg intravenously q. 6 hours (day #1)
5.  Albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 to 6 puffs q.i.d. prn
6.  Tylenol prn
7.  Propofol drip (3 mcg/kg)
8.  Ativan drip (3 mg/hr)
9.  Pepcid 20 mg q.d.
10. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
11. Haldol prn agitation
12. Total parenteral nutrition

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] works as a history professor at a
nearby community college.  He smokes two packs per day.  He
drinks occasional alcohol.  He has a wife and two children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has diabetes mellitus and coronary
artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission he was intubated and
sedated.  Temperature is 101.4, heartrate 78, blood pressure
128/50, respiratory rate 20 to 30.  Ventilatory settings were
pressure support 20, positive end-expiratory pressure 5, FIO2
40%, pulling title volumes of 850 cc.  Pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Neck was supple.  There was no
jugulovenous distension or lymphadenopathy.  Heart had a
regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Lungs had decreased breathsounds at the
left base with bronchial breathsounds in the left lower lobe.
Abdomen had normoactive bowel sounds, was obese and soft.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities showed no
edema, clubbing or cyanosis.  On neurological examination he
was sedated without spontaneous movements.

LABORATORY DATA:  (On transfer)  White blood cell count was
8.9, hematocrit 27.5, platelets 415, sodium 142, potassium
3.7, chloride 109, bicarbonate 24, BUN 27, creatinine 0.8,
glucose 166, calcium 8, magnesium 2.1, phosphate 3.6.
Arterial blood gases showed pH 7.46, pCO2 31, pO2 128.
Culture data and imaging studies as in history of present
illness and hospital course.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (By system)  1.  Infectious disease - On
transfer his antibiotics were switched to Levofloxacin 500 mg
intravenously q.d. and Ceftazidime 1 gm intravenously q. 8
hours.  It was issued adequately that two organisms had been
cultured to date - 1.  Streptococcus pneumoniae which had
been cultured from his blood at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] and was presumed for
sepsis pneumonia and sepsis; 2.  Pseudomonas which had been
cultured from endotracheal secretions at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] and was felt
to be a cause of sinusitis.  Despite this coverage, he
remained persistently febrile to 101 to 102 on a daily basis.
The Infectious Disease Service was consulted, and an
exhaustive workup was continued to determine the source of
these fevers.  He underwent a chest computerized tomography
scan to evaluate for possible empyema, which revealed
resolving left lower lobe infiltrate and only small
uncomplicated pleural effusion, not enough fluid to tap
safely.  Sinus computerized tomography scan was repeated here
which did reveal sinusitis and Otorhinolaryngology was
consulted.  They were not too impressed with the sinusitis as
the cause of his fevers.  An abdominal computerized
tomography scan was negative for any intra-abdominal source.
The lumbar puncture was negative.  Head magnetic resonance
imaging scan was negative for intracranial source other than
the known sinusitis.  Transthoracic and transesophageal
echocardiograms were negative for endocarditis.  All of his
lines were switched on more than one occasion.  He was
repeatedly pancultured and all cultures were negative at this
hospital, with the exception of one culture from an arterial
line which subsequently grew out Staphylococcus
epidermidis-the arterial line was discontinued and Vancomycin
was begun on [**2132-11-26**].  Sputum cultures from [**11-26**] also grew out Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
and this in the setting of increasing respiratory secretion
became an indication for continuing Vancomycin for
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
tracheobronchitis.  Furthermore, when he developed worsening
purulent nasal secretions on [**11-27**] and head imaging
revealed worsening sinusitis, Otorhinolaryngology was
reconsulted and performed maxillary sinus biopsy.  The gram
stain was negative, but the culture subsequently gr
