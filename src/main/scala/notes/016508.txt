echo [**3-29**]:
Conclusions:  ef 15-20%
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. There is
severe global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly to moderately thickened. Cannot exclude mild aortic
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

thickening.

CATH:


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF and had Echo here with
LVEF of 15-20%. The patient was diuresed in the Unit, but once
on floor had dyspnea on [**3-31**] and given symptoms and CXR was
thought to have flashed. He improved slightly with diuretics,
morphine and nebs, but was not tolerating diuresis based on
hypotension.  His verapamil was stopped to allow more room for
diuresis and he was aggressively diuresed while trying to
balance his low blood pressure.  He was followed closely by the
CHF service, and he did well with diuresis, aldactone, ace, bb
and digoxin.  Given his severe heart failure he should be
reavaluted in [**4-16**] months with maintained euvolemia to see if he
needs an ICD.
.
2. Transaminitis: During the patient's course he developed very
elevated LFT's.  His work-up revealed a normal RUQ US, negative
hepatitis panel and as he improved with aggressive diuresis,
this was thought to be related to CHF hepatopathy.  With
diuresis, his LFT's continued to normalize.
.
3. CAD - Given the patient's severe hypokinesis on ECHO a
concern for CAD was raised and he had a cath that was completely
normal.
.
4. COPD/pneumonia - In the unit it was thought the patient had a
COPD exacerbation so he was treated with steroids that were
slowly tapered.  He had a sputum sample showing staph aureus and
given his tenous respiratory state he was treated initially with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin and later, based on sensitivities
was treated with levaquin.  He did well with the above and
inhalers.
.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation and required a diltiazem drip on admission for rate
control, he was then on verapamil and well controlled. Given the
need for diuresis and hypotension, the patient was switched from
verapamil to a low dose beta-blocker.  He improved and was
thought to initially be in rapid afib because of his pulmonary
status.  He was kept on heparin and coumadin, but during his
course he had elevated INR.  His coumadin was held and with
vitamin K it improved.  After cardiac cath his coumadin was
restarted and should continue to be closely followed as an
outpatient.
.
6. Acute renal failure- The patient has a baseline creatinine of
1.1 and this increased to 2 during his course.  This was
attributed to poor forward cardiac flow as with diuresis his
creatinine normalized. Additionally, the patient was restarted
on his flomax which helped his urine output significantly.
.
7. Right Lower Extremity swelling: The patient's right leg was
more swollen than the left.  The patient was ruled out for DVT
with a negative LE US. A vascular surgery consult was obtained
who felt that the patient has significant arterial insufficiency
which explains the asymmetry of his edema. The swelling improved
with diuresis and the patient should follow up with his vascular
surgeon in [**2-12**] months from discharge to discuss re-intervention.
.
8. Possibly pulmonary malignancy: On Chest CT the patient was
noted to have two right lung lesions concerning for malignancy,
particularly one at the right base with adjacent pleural
thickening.  The patient was notified and this should be further
followed as an outpatient and may need a more extensive work-up.
