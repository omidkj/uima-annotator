Admission Date:  [**2110-7-9**]     Discharge Date:  [**2110-7-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2057-7-18**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHOR

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Mitral valve repair.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 52 year old
Mandarin speaking gentleman with a history of severe mitral
regurgitation.  For the past several years, the patient has
continued to have significant exercise intolerance which has
limited his ability to work.  He reports severe dyspnea on
exertion.

The patient had a recent admission earlier in the month and
he was discharged on [**2110-7-3**], after undergoing cardiac
catheterization.  This was significant for demonstrating no
flow-limited disease in the coronaries but several fistulae
from the left anterior descending to the PA.  Several of
these were coil embolized during this admission.  He
tolerated this well, was sent home, and now returns for his
mitral valve repair.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral valve regurgitation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Nitroglycerin sublingual p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient is currently on Disability and
lives at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was born in [**Country 651**].  He
denies any ETOH or tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient is in no acute distress.
Temperature is 98.3 F.; pulse is 76; blood pressure 113/52;
breathing 18; 98% on room air.  HEENT:  The patient is
missing many teeth.  Oropharynx is clear.  There is no
cervical lymphadenopathy.  Supple neck.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  His
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft
and nontender.  The patient has no cyanosis, clubbing or
edema in extremities.

LABORATORY:  On admission include a white blood cell count of
5.6, hematocrit of 32.5, platelets of 202.  Sodium of 140,
potassium of 3.5, BUN of 4, creatinine of 0.6, glucose of
137.

Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate or pneumothorax.

Cardiac catheterization demonstrates no significant disease
in the coronary arteries.  Two branches of an left anterior
descending to PA fistula which was successfully coiled.
There is a persistent flow through an inferior branch of the
left anterior descending to PA fistula and a persistent
branch of the circumflex to PA branch fistula which
anatomically were not suitable for coil embolization.
Ejection fraction was 60%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On the day of admission, the patient went
to the Operating Room and underwent a minimally invasive
mitral valve repair.  He tolerated this procedure well.  The
patient was brought to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit
in stable condition on minimal pressor support.  He was
successfully weaned off this support.  The patient was fully
weaned from ventilatory support secondary to a persistent
acidemia.  This was treated with sodium bicarbonate and a
Swan-Ganz was placed to provide close hemodynamic monitoring.
The patient was found to have stable hemodynamics with
appropriate mixed venous saturations in the 70% range.  The
patient was corrected to a normal pH of 7.41 by the first
postoperative night and remained stable.

He was then weaned off of ventilatory support and was
successfully extubated.  The patient did have a slight bit of
confusion early in post-extubation course which cleared.
This was also compounded by a language barrier since the
patient cannot speak English.

In addition, the patient's early postoperative course had a
tremendous urine output.  It was equally up to 700 cc. an
hour and a renal consultation was obtained.  He underwent a
head CT scan to rule out intracranial pathology leading to
diabetes insipidus.  This was negative.  The patient's serum
and urine electrolytes indicated that this diuresis was
appropriate.  The patient's urine output has decreased and
his BUN and creatinine remained normal.

The patient's Foley was discontinued.  He had developed some
hematuria which has resolved.  The patient has remained
stable and is now ready for discharge to home with follow-up
in approximately four weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Mitral regurgitation status post minimally invasive
mitral valve repair.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 75 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Percocet one to two p.o. q. four hours p.r.n.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.
