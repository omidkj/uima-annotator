Date of Birth:  [**2047-9-10**]             Sex:   F

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Morphine / Penicillins / Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Progressive shortness of breath, lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2124-7-3**] Two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting utilizing
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending and
spahenous vein graft to obtuse marginal. Mitral valve
replacement with 25 millimeter mosaic porcine bioprosthesis
[**2124-7-21**] Percutaneous tracheostomy with flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is an obese 76 female with known coronary artery disease
and mixed mitral regurgitation/stenosis. She has multiple
cardiac risk factors and has been previously hospitalized at
outside hospitals with congestive heart failure. Her most recent
admission was [**6-23**] at [**Hospital1 **] for increasing lower
extremity edema and progressive shortness of breath with dyspnea
on exertion. Her hospital course was complicated by a decline in
renal function which was attributed to over diuresis. On
transfer to the [**Hospital1 18**], her creatinine has improved. At time on
transfer, she denied chest pain and shortness of breath, but
continues to admit to dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea and PND.
Her pedal edema has improved.

An outside echocardiogram [**2124-5-24**] reportedly showed 3+ mitral
regurgitation with mitral stenosis. Her LVEF was estimated at
50%. Outside cardiac catheterization in [**2124-5-24**] reportedly
showed left main and LAD disease. Of note, no official reports
available at time of dictation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and remained relatively stable on
medical therapy. Due to an elevated creatinine of 2.5, her
surgery was postponed for several days. As her renal function
improved, she was cleared to proceed with cardiac surgery. Her
preoperative creatinine was 2.0. Her urine culture was
unremarkable.

On [**7-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed two vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting(left internal mammary to left anterior
descending and saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal) and a
mitral valve replacement utilzing a 25 millimeter mosaic porcine
bioprosthesis. Her intraoperative course was relatively
uneventful - she did require multiple units of packed red blood
cells for anemia. A postoperative transesophageal echocardiogram
revealed ejection fraction of 50% and no mitral regurgitation,
with only trace aortic insufficiency and trace tricuspid
regurgitation. Following the operation, she was brought to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring.

Her postoperative course will now be broken down by systems:

CARDIAC: Initially required atrial pacing for bradycardia and
first degree AV block. Eventually started on intravenous
Amiodarone for episodes of paroxsymal atrial fibrillation.
Intermittently required intravenous Hydralazine for
hypertension. She was slowly transitioned to PO Amiodarone. K
and Mg levels were monitored closely and repleted per protocol.
Over several weeks, her native heart rate improved. She remained
mostly in a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block but
continued to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation.
Experienced a hypotensive event on [**7-15**]. A TEE at that time
revealed only a small pericardial effusion with no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

PULMONARY: Initially failed extubation trial on postoperative
day two. Re-extubated on postoperative day four but required
frequent nebulizer therapies and agressive pulmonary toilet to
maintain adequate oxygenation. She remained mostly acidotic by
serial ABG's. She was agressively diuresed. Over several weeks,
her pulmonary status appearing to be somewhat improving.
Unfortunately, she required re-intubation on [**7-15**]. She was
requiring volume for oliguria at that time. Chest x-ray was
notable for significant pulmonary edema. With additional
diuresis, she was re-extubated on [**7-18**]. Serial ABG's
revealed progressive acidosis - pCO2 ranged between 50 - 70. She
displayed poor tidal volumes. It was decided to proceed with
percutaneous tracheostomy on [**7-21**]. She continues to do well
off the vent for periods of up to six hours at a time, but
tires, and becomes acidotic requiring vent support.

RENAL: Initially required Laisx drip and intravenous fluids for
low urine output. Her creatinine mostly ranged between 1.6 -
2.3.

GASTROINTESTINAL: No GI problems, speech & [**Name2 (NI) **] eval [**7-24**].
Pt. is safe to eat ground food with no modification of liquids,
as long as she is completely upright, off the ventilator, with
[**Last Name (un) 63444**] Muir valve in place.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE: Pseudomonas in sputum, with copious
secretions which are improving.  She is on Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin, and Flagyl for a total course of 2 weeks from
placement of her tracheostomy.

NEURO: Initially lethargic but mental status slowly improved
throughout her hospital course. She remained neurologically
intact. No neurological complications were noted.

HEME: Platelet count dropped as low as 67K on postoperative day
three. HIT assays remained negative and by discharge, her
platelet count normalized. Intermittently transfused with
additional packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit near
30%. She was noted to have right upper extremity swelling for
which an ultrasound was obtained on [**7-20**]. This was notable
for a focal 1 cm area of non occlusive mural based thrombus in
the lower right internal jugular vein which may be subacute. The
right upper limb veins were otherwise patent.

NUTRITION: [**Month (only) **] study on [**7-10**] was notable for soft signs
of aspiration. She was therefore placed on aspiration
precautions and a pureed diet. A video [**Month (only) **] examination on
[**7-13**] revealed moderate oral and mild pharyngeal dysphagia
with a functional [**Month (only) **] for thin liquids and ground
consistency solids. While she did not aspirate thin liquids
during the study, it is important to note that she is at risk
for trace aspiration of thin liquid, especially if not sitting
fully upright. She should not be given any mixed consistencies
(i.e. cereal with milk, chicken noodle soup). Please see above
(under GI) for [**Month (only) **] eval of [**7-24**].

Pt. has remained stable over the past few days, and is now ready
to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility to work on vent
weaning.  She has tolerated trach mask for long periods, but
after 6-8 hours often tires, and becomes acidotic, requiring
vent support.
