colitis who presented with poor PO intake, BRBPR, and altered
mental status. He became hypotensive and tachycardic during his
admission day and had worsening mental status. The etiology of
his condition was unclear, in the ddx was urosepsis, c. diff
colitis, GI source (he presented with BRBPR). HE was given fluid
support and started on empiric antibiotics. vasopressors were
not used in accordance with his families wishes. Due to his
deteriorating condition, a family meeting was held, after
discussion with his family members (including his HCP) about
options and possible outcomes, a decision was made to focus on
comfort, his status was changed to DNR/DNI. At this time the
fluid support was held, antibiotics were stopped. Supportive
care was initiated. The patient was given pain medication for
relief of pain and respiritory distress as needed. The patient
expired peacefully with his family in the room. The family was
