Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Clindamycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever at dialysis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis.

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with a history of Alzheimer's
dementia, Hypertension, ESRD on HD (M/W/F), history of
aspiration pneumonia found to have temperature of 101 at
hemodialysis this morning.  He underwent a revision of left
forearm AV fistula on [**2104-4-26**] for two aneurysmal areas with skin
ulceration but recently evaluated by transplant surgery and
thought to be fine to use.  The patient last underwent HD on
Friday (3 days prior to admission), which was unremarkable, but
felt chills after.  Over the weekend he was afebrile, no cough,
SOB, no increased sputum production (question whether had an
aspiration event).  He is AOx0 at baseline and per the daughter
mental status is at baseline.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 101 HR 86 126/65 20 97% on 3L (no
O2 at home). Exam with decreased breath sounds bilaterally.  WBC
of 14.2. CXR initially concerning for possible right apical
pneumothorax. Thoracic surgery was consulted recommending repeat
CXR to evaluate for PTX stability.  Final CXR read as no
pneumothorax (skin fold presents mimic) but with small bilateral
pleural effusions and moderate pulmonary edema without definite
consolidation.  He received one dose of clindamycin, vancomycin,
and ceftazadine.  Patient developed rash to clindamycin so given
solumedrol, tylenol. Benadryl held given h/o benadryl allergy.
.
He was given 30PR of kayexcelate for potassium of 6.2. Signout
was being given to medicine floor team but in worsening
respiratory distress requiring BiPAP and hypertensive (180/50)
requiring nitro gtt so transferred to MICU.
.
In the MICU [**5-4**] blood cultures from ED grew GPCs in clusters. He
was continued on Vancomycin and Cefepime. Thoracic surgery
signed off given no evidence of pneumothroax. Patient received
HD on [**5-19**] with 2L removed.   Vitals on transfer to the floor
were HR 72 BP 101/42 94% on 3L.
.
Currently, he appears in no acute distress, lying in bed.
Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, fevers, chills,
or any other concerning signs or symptoms.  Patient is alert to
person, but not to place or event.

CXR [**2104-5-19**]:
INDICATION: A [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with fever. Evaluate for
pneumonia.

COMPARISON: CT chest of [**2104-1-12**] and chest radiographs of
[**2104-1-11**].

CHEST, AP AND LATERAL VIEWS: Compared to the prior studies,
there is
decreased right-sided pleural effusion and persistent small left
pleural
effusion. Allowing for low lung volumes, the heart size is
enlarged. There
is diffuse interstitial opacity consistent with pulmonary edema.
Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and atherosclerotic
calcification of the aortic arch is noted, but the mediastinal
silhouette is otherwise unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen
although a skin fold presents a mimic in the upper right
hemothorax. Bones are diffusely demineralized. There is
dextroconvex scoliosis of the thoracic spine with degenerative
change, as before.

IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, but decreased on the right compared to the prior study.
Findings compatible with moderate to severe pulmonary edema. No
definite focal consolidation. Repeat radiograpy after diuresis
is recommended to assess for underlying infection.

TTE [**2104-5-20**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal and overall systolic function is normal (LVEF
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade. The
effusion appears circumferential.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved regional and global systolic function.
Small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No valvular vegetations
identified.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2102-10-3**], the pericardial and pleural effusions are new. The
severity of pulmonary hypertension has increased.

[**2104-5-20**] SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Shortness of breath.
There has been worsening of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema,
small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral atelectasis.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette otherwise unchanged.
