History of Present Illness:
86 year old female with multiple medical problems including past
PEA arrest, pneumonia requiring intubation and trach and PEG,
dCHF, a-fib who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after unresponsive
event. At 11:30 she was awake and interactive. 30 minutes later,
she appeared "blue" to staff, was unresponsive, and had a faint
to no pulse. Ten chest compressions were performed and she
became arousable, and BP was 145/80. During the code, her Paci
Muir valve was removed and she was bagged, though they did not
inflate the cuff. In the ambulance, she had a desaturation to
80%, though the cuff was never inflated. She was suctioned and
her sats improved to 100%.
.
In the ED: initial vitals were 94/54, 75, 20, 100% bagged. Her
cuff was inflated, and she was placed on CMV with TV of 420,
PEEP 5, RR20, FiO2 100%. She was given 1L NS, 1gm vancomycin,
and 400mg IV cipro.
CXR and CT head done, EKG showed NSR at 76, RAD, 1st degree AV
block, TWI in II and aVL. Transfer vitals: 97.6, BP 125/56, HR
69, RR 20, 429, 100% on CMV, 50% FiO2.
.
On the floor, she is making mouth movements. Nodding her head,
and responding to commands. She is mildly sluggish. Denies any
feeling of SOB.
.
Review of systems:
unatainable.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2113-9-7**]:
FINDINGS: The tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned.
Left mid lung
and right basilar scarring and/or atelectasis is noted. There
are no
consolidations concerning for pneumonia. The heart size is
normal.
Calcification is seen of the aorta. The mediastinal contours are
normal.
There are no pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Left mid lung and right basilar scarring and/or atelectasis.
No other
acute pulmonary or cardiac process.
.
Head CT [**2113-9-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
Study limited due to artifacts- in particular in the posterior
fossa and F. magnum.
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Correlate
clinically to decide on further workup.
2. Age-related cerebral atrophy. Prominence of the ventricles
out of
proportion to sulcal enlargement raises the possibility of
superimposed normal pressure hydrocephalus/central volume loss.
Clinical correlation is
recommended.



Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old female with multiple medical problems including past
PEA arrest, pneumonia requiring intubation and trach and EPG,
dCHF, a-fib who  presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab after unresponsive
event.
.
# Uresponsive event: Likely PEA given her history, though there
is no strip from the event to analyze. She had spontaneous
return of circulation after a short period of resuscitation. She
had low O2 sat at the time and responded to suctioning. Likely
precipitating factor was hypoxia.  Of note, per report from
patient's family, she had red cap placed on her trach during the
day of the even and had done relatively well, but had some mild
discomfort/distress.  That night was the first night she slept
with the red cap on therefore it is highly propable that her
respiratory event was related.  Other causes that were
entertained were infectious and profound hypotension secondary
to urosepsis, as she did have an initially elevated WBC of 15.
However, her CXR showed no evidence of pnaumonia and she
appeared clinically well without increased respiratory
secretions or fever.  She was weaned from the ventilator to
trach mask the morning she was admitted and continued to have O2
saturations in the high to mid 90s on FiO2 40%.  Her vitals
remained stable otherwise.  Given the patient has had multiple
presentations to the ED, it is probably premature to consider
decannulating her at this time.  We would recommend that if she
is going to have her trach capped, she should have her trach
tube downsized to allow air to move around the tube as this may
have contributed to her hypoxic event.
.
# Sepsis: The patient was hypotensive initially, though this may
have been in the setting of starting her on mechanical
ventilation with PEEP and underlying dehydration reported by
family. She was give IV fluids and maintained her pressures
without pressors.  Her UA indicated urinary tract infection.
Given her history of UTIs and multiple antibiotic allergies, she
was started on vancomycin/meropenem.  She should complete a 10
day course to end on [**9-17**].  In addition, a sputum gram stain
showed multiple organisms (GNR, Gm pos rods, GPCs) but the
cultures are pending.  This was thought to be respiratory
contamination and not from a pneumonia as the patient was
quickly weaned from her vent and did not have increased
secretions.  However, should she have a pneumonia, this would be
covered by broad antibiotics with vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**].  She was going to
have a PICC line placed, however the PICC team was unable to do
this in a timely manner so it was det
