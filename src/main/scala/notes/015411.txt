Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Capoten

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
52 year old morbidly obese male with h/o DM2, HTN, A.fib, CHF,
?cocaine induced MI presents to ED with increasing sob and
worsening leg edema x 2-3wks.  He reports he has been taking all
of his medications as prescribed and denies increased salt or
free water intake.  He does report that his lasix was recently
changed to "generic" and he says that he has not been putting
out substantial amounts of urine to the generic lasix despite
increasing his dose from 80mg [**Hospital1 **] to 160mg [**Hospital1 **] (pt. self
uptitrated his dose).  Prior the change to generic, he reports
significant UOP response to his dose of 80mg [**Hospital1 **] lasix.  He
denies CP, no palpitations, no cough, no fevers/chills.  He
denies cocaine use x2 years despite + urine tox screen for
cocaine in the ED (endorses 1x recent use to ICU fellow).  He
reports his legs have become more swollen x2-3wks w/ right
posterior thigh pain intermittently, and he has had increasing
dyspnea so that he had difficulty walking even few steps.  His
dyspnea is present even at rest.  He has O2 at home and
previously used it intermittently when he "feels SOB" and
reports he has been using it daily over this recent time period
(3.5L).  He was seen in his PCP's office yesterday and was
referred to the ED.  He, however, refused transfer to the ED at
that time and decided to present to the ED this morning when his
symptoms had not improved.
.
In the ED, initial vitals revealed RA O2sat of 82% w/ RR in the
40s, BP was 173/96 and HR 78, T 98.9.  A CXR was performed which
showed cardiomegaly without evidence of pneumonia.  BNP,
however, was found to be elevated to 1240.  Urine tox was
positive for cocaine and CEs were found to be negative x1.
Given his progressively worsening LE edema (R>L), RLE LENI was
negative for DVT.  D-dimer was found to be elevated to 729
although INR therapeutic at 2.2.  A CTA chest was performed, but
he was unable to tolerate lying flat and his INR was therapeutic
so the study was cancelled.  He received 325mg PO ASA, 80mg IV
lasix and then 40mg subsequently (to which he put out 1900cc by
time of transfer), was started on NTG gtt and was placed on
Bipap.
.
ROS:  Denies HA, changes in vision, changes in weight.  No F/C.
No cough.  Denies orthopnea prior to past 2-3wks and reports is
able to walk up stairs [**1-16**] at a time at baseline.  He is on 3.5L
home O2 "when he feels SOB" and CPAP at night (unsure of
settings).  Prior to the past 2-3wks he further denies
significant swelling in his legs.  No dysuria/hematuria.  No
melena/hematochezia.


Past Medical History:
History of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in [**2129**].
[**2133-7-22**], echocardiogram showed bilateral atrial dilation,
severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection
fraction of greater than 55%, trace mitral regurgitation,
diastolic dysfunction.  On [**1-6**], a Persantine MIBI showing
a moderate reversible perfusion
defect in the anterior and inferolateral walls with an ejection
fraction of 23%.  On [**2134-1-20**], there was a
catheterization that showed normal coronaries and global
hypokinesis. [**6-/2138**] PMIBI showed mild reversible inferior wall
perfusion defect in the presence of considerable soft tissue
attenuation, although the calculated left ventricular ejection
fraction is  46%, visual observation suggests that the ejection
fraction is normal.
#  Congestive heart failure, systolic (most recent EF from [**2137**]
PMIBI of 46%), diastolic w/ severe LVH
#  Severe pulmonary HTN noted on [**2133**] c. cath
#  Gout.
#  Morbid obesity, OSA, uses BiPAP at night
#  Atrial fibrillation, chronically anticoagulated w/ coumadin.
#  Hypertension.
#  Hypercholesterolemia.
#  Sleep apnea on CPAP, baseline oxygen requirements of [**1-16**]
liters.
#  Degenerative joint disease.
#  S/P right ankle fracture in [**2121**], status post open reduction,
internal fixation.


Social History:
+cocaine in past, but currently denies use x several years
despite positive urine tox for cocaine on this admission.
Drinks EtOH glass of wine w/ dinner.  No tobacco ever.  Denies
other illicits.  Not currently working, previously owned a
grocery store.  Is married, lives at home w/ wife and 2 [**Name2 (NI) 1685**]
children (1 child lives on own).

Pertinent Results:
[**6-/2138**] PMIBI showed mild reversible inferior wall perfusion
defect in the presence of considerable soft tissue attenuation,
although the calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is
46%, visual observation suggests that the ejection fraction is
normal.
.
[**2140-7-21**] CXR:  There is cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the
thoracic
aorta, mostly unchanged from prior study.  There is minimal
upper zone redistribution without evidence for overt failure. No
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Soft tissues and osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  Cardiomegaly with
aortic tortuosity, stable from [**2133**].
.
[**2140-7-21**] Right LENI:  No evidence of right lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis.
.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2140-7-21**]  7:02:58 AM

Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular response.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2135-6-30**] there is marked diminution in
voltage. Delayed
precordial R wave progression as previously recorded. Diffuse
ST-T wave
changes. Clinical correlation of the voltage change is
suggested.

CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: Persistent cardiomegaly although right
atrial and SVC contours are decreased in today's study.
Plate-like left base atelectasis. Decreased vascular congestion.
There is no pneumothorax, and no large pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Slightly improved CHF as evidenced by decreased
vascular congestion and decreased size of right atrium and SVC
contours.
