Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-12**] Cardiac catherization
[**2164-4-18**] Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with a left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and reverse
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and the obtuse
marginal artery

History of Present Illness:
65 year old female with known CAD s/p DES to Lcx on [**9-19**] on ASA
and Plavix, h/o PE on coumadin with subtherapeutic INR, and
pulmonary fibrosis in the setting of radiation to treat hodgkins
disease.  She has been c/o doe for the last week and a half.
.
Claims to have SOB at baseline from pulmonary fibrosis.  For
last month, patient has noticed worsening SOB with exertion.
Could only walk a few steps before becoming acutely SOB.  Also,
had episodes of SOB at rest, sitting up in bed, or laying in
bed.  Complete rest with little exertion helped resolved
sympotms.  Denied pain during this time.  Five nights prior to
presenation, patient awoke in the middle of the night with
severe crushing chest pain like "an elephant sitting on her
chest".  Did not take an asprin, did not call 911, did not alert
husband.  [**Name (NI) 1194**] resolved in 20-30 minutes.  Followed up at
doctor's office per husband's wishes.
.
The patient presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] office today c/o above
symptoms.  Endorsed 2-3lb weight gain, PND. Vitals in Dr. [**Name (NI) 108233**] office were 110/60  90  16 RR 100% RA  at rest.  With
activity, vitals changed to HR of 110 RR: 30 90-92% on RA
visibly dyspneic after 2 laps.  In office EKG after ambulation
showed new ST depressions in lateral leads.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were  96.4 89 123/43 16 100%.  A
hemolyzed specimen was sent.  She was started on heparin gtt and
admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].   EKG showed ST depressions in II, III, and
aVF V5 V6.  Seen by Cards who agreed with heparin drip.

Pertinent Results:
[**2164-4-12**] Cardiac Catherization: 1.  Selective coronary angiography
of this right dominant system three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA was found ot have no flow limiting stenosis.
The LAD had an ostial 80% narrowing.  The Lcx had a 90%
mid-stent restenosis.  The RCA had an ostial 60-70% lesion. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 21 mmHg and a mean PCWP of
20mmHg.  There was moderatl severe pulmonary hypertension, with
a PASP of 55mmHg. Moderate systemic hypertension was noted, wth
a cental aortic pressure of 166/67 mmHg.

Final Report
INDICATION: Coronary artery bypass grafting, permanent
pacemaker, assess for
right pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: Radiographs dating back to [**2164-4-11**] and most recently
[**2164-4-30**].

FINDINGS: Persistent right middle, right lower, and left lower
lobe
atelectasis are unchanged. A moderately large left pleural
effusion is
stable. The right pneumothorax is moderate in size, relatively
unchanged
since [**2164-4-30**], a right hydropneumothorax, best seen on the
lateral projection
on yesterday's radiograph appears loculated and persists on the
current study. The tip of the right upper extremity peripherally
inserted central venous catheter is projected over the expected
location of the lower superior vena cava. The permanent
pacemaker wires terminate over the right atrium and ventricle.
The nasogastric tube and median sternotomy wires are unchanged
in satisfactory position.Extensive subcutaneous emphysema has
slightly decreased in severity.

IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent right middle and lower lobe and left lower lobe
collapse.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion.
3. Right-sided loculated hydropneumothorax, stable since
[**2164-4-30**].
Cardiac echo: [**2164-4-23**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with septal akinesis to dyskinesis (the
apex is not well seen). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.






Brief Hospital Course:
The pt. was admitted and underwent cardiac cath [**2164-4-12**] and had
80% LAD, 90% LCX with mid stent restenosis, and an ostial 60-70%
RCA lesion.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted for cardiac surgery.  Preop
carotid studies showed a 50-99% right carotid stenosis and a
stable 40-50% stenosis on the left.  She was seen by vascular
surgery who did not recommend intervention.  She continued
having chest pain with EKG changes at rest and was waiting for a
plavix washout.  On [**2164-4-18**] she underwent CABGx3(LIMA->LAD,
SVG->OM, dRCA).  She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CV
