Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematuria
Reason for ICU Admission: Hypotension, requiring pressor


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 656**] is an 81 yo M with a history CAD s/p CABG, HTN,
chronic renal failure (b/l crt 1.4-1.6), s/p elective hip
replacement in [**2144-8-26**], which was complicated by
cardiogenic shock, VRE bacteremia & PEA arrest, discharged on
[**2144-9-11**] to rehab, who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital
for evaluation and management of fevers (102.6) & hypotension
(reportedly 90/palp). Pt was initially brought to MWH b/c of
bloody foley output noted after sustaining foley trauma (pt
accidentally tugged on foley while toileting on day of
presentation). However, while getting evaluated for the
hematuria, he spiked a fever to 102.6 and was noted to have a
UTI, for which he got CTX. Decision was made to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**], where he has gotten much of his care, for further eval.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 98.9, 73, 82/46, 27, 96% on 2L. His MS was
clear. He appeared dyspneic. UA was +. CXR w/o clear
consolidation and not significantly changed from prior. He was
given Ceftaz/flagyl for UTI. He got 4L IVF & was still
hypotensive. R IJ was placed b/c of hypotension in setting of
presumed sepsis. CVP reportedly 22. Levophed started for
persitent hypotension in setting of nml/elevated CVP. Pt
admitted to MICU for further care.
.
ROS: Pt notes no fever, chills, nausea, vomitting, constipation,
diarrhea, melena, BRBPR, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness or
lightheadedness change in vision, numbness, tingling, weakness.
He does note recent bladder spasms & dysuria over last week. No
flank pain. He has also had significant b/l LE swelling since
hip repair. He has baseline SOB. Gets SOB after ~30yards, which
is reportedly stable.

[**2144-9-23**] CXR:  AP chest compared to [**9-9**] through 19:
Mild pulmonary edema minimally improved since [**9-22**] despite
increase in volume of moderate right pleural effusion. Aeration
at the left lung base has improved, probable small left pleural
effusion persists. Heterogeneity in the widespread infiltrative
pulmonary abnormality suggests some residual multifocal
pneumonia, particularly in the suprahilar right lung. Heart size
top normal, unchanged. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line
passes to the upper right atrium but the tip is obscured. No
pneumothorax.

[**9-22**] RUQ U/S
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver echotexture is
normal. No focal
lesions are seen. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilation. The
gallbladder has been removed. The common duct is not dilated.
Bilateral
pleural effusions are seen, though no ascites fluid is seen on
four quadrant
assessment.

LIVER DOPPLER: The main, right anterior, right posterior and
left portal
veins are patent with the appropriate direction of flow. The
right middle and
left hepatic veins are patent, with appropriate waveforms. The
main hepatic
artery demonstrates a normal waveform as well. The inferior vena
cava is
patent with normal waveform.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions. No ascites fluid detected.
2. Patent hepatic vasculature.

[**2144-9-21**] Chest/abd/pelvis CT
1. Areas of patchy consolidation in bilateral lungs, consistent
with
multifocal pneumonia. Associated bilateral pleural effusions.
2. No evidence of abscess or colitis, however, study is limited
secondary to lack of intravenous contrast.
3. Central venous catheter with tip in the superior vena cava.
4. No obvious abscess in the right hip region, however, region
unable to be adequately assessed secondary to artifact from
right hip replacement.

[**2144-9-21**] Echo
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-9-1**],
the findings are similar.

EKG
Sinus rhythm with first degree A-V delay
Left atrial abnormality Delayed R wave progression with late
precordial QRS transition - is nonspecific ST-T wave
abnormalities - cannot exclude in part ischemia - clinical
correlation is suggested Since previous tracing of [**2144-9-9**], rate
