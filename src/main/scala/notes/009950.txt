HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS

This patient is a 80 year old female with a history of CHF
and COPD who complains of severe ABD PAIN radiating ot her
back. Patient reports constipation for the past 5 days,
blood in stool, and left leg numbness. Patient comes from
[**Hospital3 **], where a CT scan ruled out AAA but shows
evidence for ischemic colitis. The patient was hypotensive
at the outside hospital and was started on neo. She was not
given antibiotics. Her last bowel movement was about an hour
ago which consisted of diarrhea.

[**2125-2-22**] Pathology: Tissue: Colon:
Ileum and colon, exploratory laparotomy:
1.  Ischemic colitis with diffuse mucosal damage and focal
submucosal edema and transmural acute inflammation; distal end
demonstrates mucosal ischemia only.
2.  Proximal ileal resection margin, within normal limits.
3.  Five adenomata, measuring from 0.3 to 1.1 cm in greatest
dimension; no high grade dysplasia or carcinoma seen.
4.  Regional lymph nodes, within normal limits.
5.  Medial calcification and atherosclerosis of arteries of
mesocolon

[**2125-2-23**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2125-2-23**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. The pacemaker leads
terminate in right atrium and right ventricle. Cardiomegaly is
unchanged. There is
interval improvement of pulmonary edema, currently minimal.
There is no
substantial pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax. Right
internal
jugular line tip is at the level of mid low SVC.
Linear opacities projecting over the pacemaker are new and most
likely
represents overlying findings , and unlikely to represent
discontinued
pacemaker leads but repeated radiograph to clarify this point is
recommended.

[**2125-2-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
Comparison is made to prior study from the chest radiograph from

[**2125-2-23**]. There is a right-sided pacemaker distally tips in
the right atrium and right ventricle, appropriately sited. There
is a right IJ central venous line whose tip is in the distal
SVC. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are appropriately
sited. There is persistent cardiomegaly. There has been interval
worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity. No significant
pulmonary edema is seen. There are no pneumothoraces.

[**2125-2-25**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. Left axis
deviation. First
degree A-V block. Intraventricular conduction defect with
atypical left
bundle-branch block. Probable old anterolateral myocardial
infarction.
No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2125-2-25**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION:
1. The patient is markedly rotated on the current examination.
The
endotracheal tube has its tip 4.4 cm above the carina. A
nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
tip not identified. A right
internal jugular central line is unchanged in position with its
tip in the
proximal to mid SVC.
2. There is worsening bilateral airspace process, likely
pulmonary edema with increasing consolidation at the left base
likely reflecting compressive atelectasis in the setting of a
pleural effusion. A smaller right effusion is also likely
evident. A right-sided dual-lead pacer remains in place with its
leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium
and right ventricle respectively. No pneumothorax appreciated.
Heart remains enlarged.

[**2125-2-28**] PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: A right dual-lead
pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
atrium and right ventricle. A nasogastric tube is noted with tip
not clearly visualized in the field of view. A right IJ catheter
appears kinked as before; however, the tip projects over the
upper SVC in unchanged position from the prior examination.
Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is no pneumothorax. Mild
pulmonary
edema is unchanged from the prior examination. Stable left lower
lobe opacity may represent pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis; however, infectious process such as pneumonia
cannot be completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.
Minimal opacification at the right lung base may also represent
atelectasis versus aspiration pneumonitis or pneumonia

[**2125-3-2**] CHEST(PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2-28**]:
Mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis have both
improved since [**2-28**]. Transvenous right atrial and right
ventricular pacer leads follow their expected courses. Pleural
effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax


Brief Hospital Course:
The pt initially presented to an OSH with acute onset abdominal
pain which began suddenly earlier that morning that was
associated with non-bloody diarrhea. At the OSH she was
hypotensive to the 70's so was bolused with crystalloid fluids
and started on pressors.  A CT scan at the time showed diffuse
non-specific colitis and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

On arrival in the Ed she was noted to be hypotensive to the 90s
with escalating doses of Neo-Synephrine.  Troponin' were
negative, and patient's abdominal exam was consistent with
peritonitis with mental status changes. After a discussion with
the family and patient she consented to an exploratory
laparotomy. She was given Vancomycin, Cipro and Flagyl
preoperatively.

Please see operative note for further details. at laparotomy
patient was noted to have ischemic splenic flexure through
sigmoid colon.  Her Right colon  was dilated and thin with a
cecal bascule,  A subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy was
performed.
A Jp drain was left above her [**Doctor Last Name 3379**].

Post operatively she was transferred to the ICU, intubated on
dual pressors. A Right femoral a-line placed. A TTE was
performed and her pacer was interrogated. Cardiac enzymes were
cycled without evidence for myocardial injury. By POD 1 she was
off pressors with stable vital signs.  She was started o
