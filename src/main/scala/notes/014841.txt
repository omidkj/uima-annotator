Chief Complaint:
ischemic L foot

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-2-9**] diagnostic angiogram of left lower extremity via right
femoral access
[**2112-2-10**] left AKpop-Pt [**Name (NI) **] with reversed GSV


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 70yo M recently admitted at [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital for LLE
cellulitis and MRSA bacteremia.  Was discharged to rehab on [**1-31**]
but readmitted [**2-1**] for hypoglycemia (66) and weakness.  Today
his
L foot was noted to be cooler than the R, and an "arterial
ultrasound" showed a "distal clot" (notes aren't more specific
and the actual report isn't currently available).  Accordingly,
he is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and management of
ischemic L foot

ART EXT (REST ONLY) Study Date of [**2112-2-4**] 11:10 AM
FINDINGS: Segmental limb pressures are 255 throughout on the
right, likely
falsely elevated due to calcific atherosclerotic plaque
formation causing non- compressibility of the vessels. On the
left side, values are 255 for the thigh and calf and 247 at the
level of the posterior tibial artery.

Doppler waveforms show triphasic waveforms of the
femoropopliteal areas on the right as well as the posterior
tibial artery on the right side. The waveform is monophasic at
the level of the dorsalis pedis artery. On the left, the On the
left, the femoropopliteal waveforms are normally triphasic and
the posterior tibial artery waveform is monophasic. There are
similar findings seen with pulse volume recordings with
amplitude loss and waveform widening at the level of the ankle
and metatarsal bilaterally. ABIs on the left is 2.47. It is to
be noted that the left waveform at the level of the left
dorsalis pedis artery could not be obtained suspicious for its
occlusion.

Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic function appears
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to dyskinesis of the basal inferior posterior wall,
and akinesis of the interventricular septum. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
