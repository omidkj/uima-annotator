amount of blood but was negative for infection.  Sodium 142,
potassium 3.9, chloride 111, bicarbonate 24, blood urea
nitrogen 14, creatinine 0.6 with a blood sugar of 107, anion
gap 11.  ALT 14, AST 17, alkaline phosphatase 39, total
bilirubin 0.3, cholesterol 213 in [**Month (only) 359**].  Hemoglobin A1C
was 4.1 percent.  [**Month (only) 359**] laboratories also revealed
triglyceride 99, HDL 61, cholesterol/HD 3.5, calculated LDL

Preoperative chest x-ray was unremarkable with no acute
cardiopulmonary disease.  Please refer to the final report
dated [**2101-9-30**].

Cardiac catheterization performed on [**2101-9-30**], showed
ejection fraction of 56 percent, aortic and mitral valves
were normal.  There were no wall motion abnormalities.  The
coronaries were normal.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
for closure of her patent foramen ovale.  The patient was
admitted same day admission to the hospital [**2101-10-10**], and
Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] performed a minimally invasive patent foramen
ovale closure.  The patient was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on a Propofol drip at 20
mg/kg/minute in stable condition.  The patient was extubated
later that day and on postoperative day number one,
postoperative laboratories were as follows:  White blood cell
count 11.2, hematocrit 24.2, platelet count 197,000.  Sodium
142, potassium 2.8, chloride 113, bicarbonate 23, blood urea
nitrogen 13, creatinine 0.4, with a blood sugar of 105.  The
patient was briefly on an insulin drip and also received
Zofran for vomiting.  She was hemodynamically stable with a
blood pressure of 92/43 and a heart rate of 63 and sinus
rhythm, oxygen saturation 99 percent on two liters nasal
cannula.  Her chest tubes were removed on postoperative day
number one and the patient was transferred out to the floor
to begin ambulating with the nurses and physical therapy and
start her rehabilitation.  She was evaluated by physical
therapy at that time.  On postoperative day number two, the
patient had a little bit of dizziness with ambulation but
this resolved.  Lopressor beta blockade was begun as well as
Lasix diuresis and Plavix was restarted.  Her breath sounds
were diminished at the bases.  Her heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  She was hemodynamically stable saturating 97 percent
in room air with a blood pressure of 115/61 in sinus rhythm
in the 60s.  Her dressings were clean, dry and intact.
Central venous line was removed.  Her pacing wires remained
in place.  Her magnesium was repleted.  Her hematocrit
remained approximately 23.  Iron was started.  The patient
received one unit of packed red blood cells that evening for
her anemia.  Her pain was managed with Percocet.  After one
unit of packed red blood cells, on postoperative day number
three, her hematocrit only rose to 23.0.  She was alert and
oriented but she received a second unit for being slightly
lethargic and  little bit weak and appeared to be slightly
symptomatic from her anemia.  Per neurology, the patient will
continue her Plavix indefinitely.  On postoperative day
number three, the patient had a voided a total of 900 cc but
complained of still having the urge to void.  A bladder scan
showed approximately 999 cc residual.  The patient was
catheterized for 1100 cc and Foley remained in place for her
urinary retention.  On postoperative day number four, she was
feeling much better after her second unit of cells.  Her
electrolytes were repleted.  A urology consultation was
obtained.  Her pacing wires were discontinued.  She was
encouraged to ambulate with plans to hopefully discharge her
over the weekend and pull the Foley at midnight and allow the
patient to have another voiding trial.  Foley was pulled at
11:00 a.m. on the following day.  The patient was doing well
on postoperative day number five with a little bit of urinary
retention.  She was started on Flomax per urology
consultation and was beginning to get some function back as
she continued to void in sufficient amounts.  She was again
encouraged to ambulate.  Her creatinine was stable at 0.6 and
her hematocrit rose to 30.1.  Her urine culture was negative.
The patient was instructed to follow-up with urology.  Her
incisions were clean, dry and intact.  On the evening prior
to discharge, she was voiding with good amounts approximately
one liter without any difficulty and was taking Motrin and
Tylenol for her incisional pain.  The patient was discharged
to home in stable condition on [**2101-10-16**].
