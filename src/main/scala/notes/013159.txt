Admission Date:  [**2200-11-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2200-12-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2129-6-27**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
male whose past medical history is significant for relapsing
polychondritis and bilateral bronchial collapse with a
history of recurrent pneumonias, status post bronchial stent
placement on [**2200-8-8**] complicated by left main
pulmonary artery embolism and persistent pseudomonal
pneumonias.

The patient receives a majority of his care at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 622**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Medical Center in [**State **] State with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54215**].  The
patient was transferred to the Interventional Pulmonology
team's care at [**Hospital1 69**] for stent
removal.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Relapsing polychondritis diagnosed in [**2178**]; chronically
on steroids - diagnosed by an auricular biopsy.
 2.  Pulmonary embolism in [**2200-8-27**]; status post
inferior vena cava filter in [**2200-9-27**] - on chronic
anticoagulation.
 3.  Recurrent pseudomonal pneumonia; chronically on
antibiotics.
 4.  Clostridium difficile colitis diagnosed in [**2200-9-27**]; managed on by mouth vancomycin.
 5.  Herpes simplex of gluteal region; managed on aciclovir.
 6.  History of supraventricular tachycardia versus
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; managed with anticoagulation.
 7.  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia; noted to be stable (per
patient); a mantle cell lymphoma with recent transformation.
 8.  Depression.
 9.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
10.  Chronic [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure requirement
due to airway obstruction.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at the time of
admission were unclear.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  As stated, the patient's primary care
physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 54215**] in [**Location (un) 18317**] (telephone
number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 54216**]).  The patient has a 30-pack-year smoking
history.  Minimal alcohol history.  He lives in [**Location 18317**] with
his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In general, he was
alert and oriented times three.  Vital signs were stable.
The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
was significant for saddle nose deformity and boxer ears.
Moist mucous membranes.  No jugular venous distention.  No
crepitus in the neck.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
distant heart sounds.  Regular first heart sounds and second
heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs had
stridor, end-expiratory wheezes, and bronchial breath sounds
throughout.  The abdomen had normal active bowel sounds.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  No
costovertebral angle tenderness.  Extremities revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Normal perfusion.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 29.2 (with a differential of 41% neutrophils
and 56% lymphocytes), his hematocrit was 31.1, and his
platelets were 462.  Electrolytes were within the normal
range.  Bicarbonate was noted to be 36.  Calcium, magnesium,
and phosphate were within the normal range.

IMPRESSION:  The impression was that this was a 71-year-old
male with a history of bronchomalacia secondary to relapsing
polychondritis with postobstructive recurrent pseudomonal
pneumonia, status post two left main stem stents placed in
[**2200-6-27**] in [**State **] State.

The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in [**Location (un) 18317**] at
that time where he was found to have another pseudomonal
pneumonia.  He was treated with Zosyn.  His shortness of
breath continued and fevers continued at that time.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] to have stent removed on [**2200-11-11**].

A rigid bronchoscopy was performed on [**2200-11-13**] and
the proximal stent was removed with minimal hemoptysis
afterward.  Distal stent was noted at that time to be
partially obstructing the left lower lobe.  The patient was
continued at that time on piperacillin, tazobactam, and
azithromycin for double pseudomonal coverage for pneumonia.
The patient was continued on vancomycin by mouth for
Clostridium difficile colitis.

The patient underwent a repeat bronchoscopy on [**11-18**].
The residual stent could not be removed secondary to a left
pneumothorax that developed inter-procedure, requiring a
left-sided chest tube to alleviate bradycardia and
hypotension.  The patient was intubated electively and placed
on ventilator overnight post procedure, extubated on [**11-19**].

Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted regarding removal of the
remainder of the stent, but the patient was deemed to be a
poor surgical candidate.  The patient was noted to develop
pleural effusions bilaterally.  Underwent a thoracentesis on
[**2200-11-20**] which was thought to be secondary to
parapneumonic effusions; although, the left ventricular
hypertrophy was greater than 1000.

A chest x-ray on [**11-22**] revealed a pneumomediastinum,
and the patient had increased subcutaneous air in his neck,
back, and arms; all presumed to be complications of the chest
tube.

On [**11-23**], the patient had decreasing oxygen
saturations, and an increased respiratory rate, and labored
breathing.  A chest x-ray at that time revealed no worsening
of the pneumothorax, and the hypoxia was presumed to be due
to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  [**Hospital1 **]-level positive
airway pressure at that time was held to avoid worsening
positive pressure and worsening subcutaneous air.  The
patient was closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.  An
Angiocath was placed in lieu of the chest tube with
concomitant improvement in the subcutaneous air.  The chest
tube was placed to water seal and subsequently discontinued
by the Interventional Pulmonology Service.

On [**11-25**], the patient underwent another bronchoscopy
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and distal stent was able to be removed with
laser excision and bronchodilation.  Sputum was sent from the
bronchoscopy for diagnosis and speciation of pseudomonal
pneumonia.  The patient was intubated again post procedure
and was extubated without complications within 24 hours.

He was transferred to the floor for further management with
his breathing much improved and chronic productive yellow
sputum and cough.  The patient was encouraged to have chest
physical therapy as well as incentive spirometry.  He was
given nebulizers and mucolytics.  Ambulated with Physical
Therapy until he regained his strength and saturations
remained stable on room air.  Over this course, the patient's
bowel movements decreased.  Vancomycin was discontinued.  The
patient's zoster rash improved, and the aciclovir was
discontinued.  The patient improved daily until the day of
discharge.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  BRONCHIAL STENT AND LEFT LOWER LOBE OBSTRUCTION:
Resolved with stent removal.

 2.  TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX:  Resolved with chest tube
placement and then discontinuance.

 3.  PSEUDOMONAL PNEUMONIA:  Resolved when cultures of
bronchoscopy did not grow out Pseudomonas.  It was assumed
that the patient was colonized as he was afebrile off of all
antibiotics and breathing well.

 4.  CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE COLITIS:  Clostridium difficile
colitis resolved.  The patient had completed greater than a
4-week course of vancomycin by mouth.  He was having one
bowel movement per day at the time of discharge with no
cramping and no fevers.

 5.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/ HISTORY OF PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND
INFERIOR VENA CAVA FILTER:  The patient was continued on
Lovenox until 48 hours after his INR was greater than 2 on
Coumadin.

 6.  TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA:  The patient was continued on
prednisone 20 mg once per day; to be weaned down to 10 mg
daily at his baseline dose by his primary care physician over
the next few weeks.  The patient was maintained on Protonix
while on prednisone.  He was given alendronate weekly,
calcium, and vitamin D.  He was given Mucomyst as needed,
albuterol and
