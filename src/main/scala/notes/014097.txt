Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure/Pneumonia: Ms. [**Known lastname 46197**] required
intubation secondary to hypoxic respiratory failure during her
first evening in the ICU.  This was attributed to her underlying
CAP in the setting of severe baseline COPD. She was treated for
CAP with ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vancomycin for 7 days,
and was then briefly extubated on HD 6 after tolerating
appropriate weaning.   Despite this, she required reintubation
after several hours for continued hypoxia.  A chest x-ray after
extubation revealed a modest degree of pulmonary edema.  It was
postulated that her continued respiratory failure was caused by
a worsening pneumonia as well as flash pulmonary edema
immediately following extubation. At this point, she was
restarted on vancomycin and zosyn for presumed VAP and was
continued on bronchodilators and steroids for COPD management.
She was again weaned from the ventilator on HD 15 after finshing
14 full days of antibiotics.  Prior to the second extubation, in
an attempt to avoid flash pulmonary edema, Ms. [**Known lastname 46197**] was actively
diuresed and her blood pressure was aggressively controlled with
a nitrogylycerin drip. Despite these measures, she still failed
extubation secondary to hypoxia and increased work or breathing
with some evidence of mild pulmonary edema.  Given these
circumstances, her family was consulted about the possiblity of
tracheostomy for vent weaning. THey agreed to this and the
patient received a tracheostomy (and PEG) on [**2196-9-21**]. Procedure
went well without complications.  PEG was working well and
patient was receiving tube feed at goal (Promote with fiber) at
55 cc/hr.  Attempted speech and swallow eval prior to discharge,
however, pt did not tolerate PMV during admission. It is being
sent with her to the rehab facility for appropriate weaning from
trach.
.
2. Hypertension: Despite patient's presentation with bacterial
pneumonia, she remained chronically hypertensive throught this
hospitalization.  Her blood pressure was also extremely labile
and difficult to control, especially in the setting of
respiratory distress and agitation. Multiple regimens were
implemented in various combinations including increased
beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, hydralazine and
occasional nitroprusside or nitroglycerin gtts.  Though she is
maintained with an ACE inhibitor at home, it was not initially
used in her management as she had increased creatinine. On
discharge, she was maintained on metoprolol 125 mg [**Hospital1 **] as well
as lisinopril 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
3. Acute-on-chronic RF: Acute component of renal failure
attributed to hypovolemia and later, to ATN, as supported by a
calculated FENa of >1%. She was aggressively rehydrated
initially, and eventually had increased spontaneous diuresis and
creatinine returned to baseline (on discharge, 1.4).  Pt also
noted to have sterile pyuria during hospitalization with bloody
urine; foley was replaced and pt was treated 3 day course of
ciprofloxacin for presumed UTI. Urinary issues resolved.
.
4. Hyperglycemia/DM: Was intermittently controlled in the ICU
with insulin gtt and insulin sliding scale. Patient was
discharged on insulin sliding scale.
.
5. ESRD s/p transplant: Essentially stable during this
admission. Followed closely by the renal transplant team for
titration of tacrolimus, cellcept, prednisone, espeically in the
setting of receiving intermittent doses of stress-dose steroids
for the COPD component of her respiratory disease.  Discharged
on Cellcept [**Pager number **] mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 5 mg daily and tacrolimus 4
mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
6. Anemia: Essentially at baseline during this admission, though
pt was started on ProCrit 3000 units 3 times per week for
maintenance of baseline hematocrit.
