Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5438**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain
Reason for transfer to MICU: ?sepsis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79 yo woman w/ h/o known CAD s/p RCA stent [**2103**] and [**2105**], severe
MR, A fib, tachy/brady s/p PM, h/o GIB, and chronic urinary
retention s/p recent cystectomy with ileal loop who presents as
transfer from OSH ED after being evaluated there for c/o CP.
While at rehab following recent surgery, patient has had
constant pain in abdomen since her surgery, as well as nausea
over the last several days. She then noted onset of intermittent
SSCP yesterday, ~[**5-21**]. This continued most of the day, but
improved w/ percocet administered by her rehab. Patient then
reports waking up this AM with 10/10 chest pain. CP described as
"heaviness," similar to prior MI. This was associated with
radiation of pain to her stomach, and legs. Also associated with
nausea, but denies associated SOB. CP continued, so she was
taken to the OSH ED.
.
On arrival to OSH ED, BP 120/51, HR 125. EKG revealed sinus tach
with lateral ST depressions. Given Zofran 4mg x1, ASA 162mg x1,
and Morphine 4mg IV x1 initially. Started on heparin gtt. CP not
controlled, so patient given Nitro drip, then Lopressor 5mg IV
x1. Per ED records, she is also noted to have a WBC count of
22.1 w/ 9% bands. Afebrile per records at OSH ED w/ temp 96.8.
+UA per ED records, however, patient has urostomy bag. Given
ceftriaxone 1mg IV x1 at OSH. Given concern for ACS, patient
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] cardiology service for further management.
On transfer, ED records indicate "disposition vital signs" with
a blood pressure of 87/42.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6, patient normotensive w/ BP 104/54, HR 96.
Patient denies chest pain, but c/o [**4-20**] abdominal pain. Of note,
she reports having abdominal pain every day since her surgery on
[**2113-2-16**]. Reports subjective fevers, and nausea x several days.
Denies dysuria or diarrhea, stating "I have a bag." Unsure if
increased output from ostomy bags."
.
While on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 her blood pressure dropped into the 80's. Given
the overall picture of hypothermia, elevated white count, low
BP, and tachycardia, MICU was called to assess the patient.
.
On interview patient says she has not felt truly well since
having her surgery on [**2-16**]. She says she's had unremitting
abdominal since that time, which has gotten acutely worse over
the past 2-3 days. The worsening pain has been accompanied by
nausea and a desire to vomit but says she hasn't been able to
bring anything up. She says she's lost about 30 pounds in teh
past 2-3 years.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient arrived in the MICU.  She was mentating beautifully
despite BP in the 80-90's, with two peripheral IV's, 1 of which
was running the heparin gtt for her ACS and the other running
the remaining IVF which had been ordered for her on the floor.
Initially she seemed to be responding to the IVF, with her
pressures up into the high 80's-90's.  While getting the ICU
consent, she refused several things on the consent form
including A-lines, LP, etc.  There was a fairly involved
discussion about central lines because there was a high
liklihood that she might need one, and she did agree to one if
necessary.  Her pressures/MAPS did not improve and the RN's
couldn't get any further PIV's.  Her mentation remained
excellent but there was some concern as her BP wasn't
stabilizing, and we also needed more access for IV antibiotics.
The RN's also discovered that her ostomy appeared very strange
when they removed her ostomy appliance - it didn't look like a
normal round, ostomy - it appeared sunken, more like a natural
fistula than a surgically created ostomy.

Her abdominal exam was somewhat tender to palpation but no
rebound or guarding.
The MICU attending was called and there were multiple failed
attempts at placing a central line. The patient's BP dwindled
after the fluid was completed and did not respond to another
bolus, staying in the low eighties and then dropping further to
the seventies.  Patient was started on periheral dopamine to
support her blood pressure.  Her mental status began to
deteriorate and We (Attending, primary RN, other RNs, and
resident) stopped and discussed the overall situation.  We had
failed to get any central access and the patient was requiring a
supratherapeutic dose of peripheral dopamine to maintain any
kind of BP/MAP.   Her stat labs had come back and were overall
worse with notable ARF.  We discussed whether there was any
utility in calling a surgery consult.  During the initial
interview, the patient had made it clear that she did not want
any aggressive interventions and was very specific about not
wanting any further surgeries.  Given her HD instability, active
ACS, her ARF, and previously stated wishes, the attending spoke
to the patient, who was sleepy but mentating to some degree,
explaining that she was extremely ill, and that we were going to
stop all invasive aggressive procedures and
