IMAGING:
CXR ([**1-8**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

CT Head ([**1-8**]): IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage. No change from [**5-10**], [**2180**].
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The maxillary sinuses are
incompletely imaged, and no fluid is detected in the included
portions of them. However, there is an apparent inferior and
medial left orbital blow out fracture, of uncertain chronicity.
Elements of it appear new since the study of [**2180-5-10**], but the
absence of ethmoidal or maxillary hemorrhage argues against an
acute fracture.

Bilateral LENIs ([**1-10**]): IMPRESSION: Essentially occlusive
thrombus throughout bilateral common femoral, superficial
femoral, and popliteal veins as well as greater saphenous vein.

Abdomen Film ([**1-10**]): IMPRESSION: Filter in lower IVC.

CT Head ([**1-11**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive new intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left
posterior
parietal cortex since [**2181-1-8**], extending into the subdural
space along with the falx and tentorium cerebri. No
intraventricular extension or midline shift. No evidence of
herniation.
2. Unchanged old right thalamic lacunar infarct.

CXR ([**1-11**]): The new intended right subclavian line turns abruptly
lateral at the upper margin of the right clavicle. The position
of the tip is not consistent with a central intravenous
location. It could be in a small vein, or a pleural space. In
the absence of pulmonary hematoma it is unlikely to be in the
lung, though the new right pneumothorax projecting over the
pleural sulcus and a small right pleural effusion suggest that
the lung may have been engaged during the line placement. ET
tube in standard placement, nasogastric tube ends in the distal
stomach. Left lung grossly clear. Leftward mediastinal shift
probably a function of new right pneumothorax and pleural
effusion.

TTE ([**1-12**]): The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is not well
seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are not well seen.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to poor echo
windows/intubation. No cardiac source of embolism seen. Left
ventricular function is probably normal, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle has
normal size and function. No pathologic valvular abnormality
seen.

Carotid Series ([**1-12**]): IMPRESSION: Minimal focal scattered
calcific plaque, no associated ICA or CCA stenosis however.

EEG ([**1-13**]): IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG telemetry captured
no pushbutton activations or electrographic seizures. No
interictal epileptiform discharges were seen. The background did
reach a normal alpha frequency during wakefulness, although
through most of the day's recording slower background activity
was suggestive of e
