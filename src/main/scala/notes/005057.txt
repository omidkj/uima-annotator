He has presented in [**7-24**] and [**9-23**] for BRBPR, attributed to
friability and edema of mucosa of sigmoid colon and descending
colon, compatible with colitis. Patient was hemodynamically
stable with Hct around 30s throughout [**9-23**] admission. Stool cx
were negative, C diff was negative, and colon biopsies showed
active colitis. Colonoscopy showed severe diverticulosis which
appeared to be nonbleeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 M with previous BRBRP [**7-24**] and [**9-23**] attributed to colitis,
severe diverticulosis, Cdiff colitis, EGD with no bleeding
source [**9-23**], recent MICU discharge for ESBL Klebsiella
urosepsis [**2123-12-18**], bilateral urolithiasis with R ureteral stent
and L perc nephrostomy tube, CHF, here with BRBPR x 1 day.
.
# BRBPR/LGIB:
Colonoscopy revealed diverticulosis with clots in diverticuli,
but no evidence of active bleed.  He received a total of 4 U
prbcs and his hct has stabilized.  He has had no addtional
episodes of BRBPR since colonoscopy but continues to have guaic
positive stools.  Furthermore, he has remained hemodynamically
stable.  In terms of previous GI evaluation, he does have a
history of gastritis and was started on a PPI. He was admitted
on an H2 blocker and most recent EGD did not reveal any evidence
of gastritis.  Both PPIs and H2 blockers can potentiate
thrombocytopenia, and although not thought to be the cause of
his thrombocytopenia (given he has been on both prior to
developing low platelets), we will currently keep him off PPI
and H2 blocker and start him on sucralfate.
.
# UTI: On admission, UA showed numerous WBC and RBCs, but no
organisms.  He has known urolithiasis and has recent
hospitalization for Klebsiella urosepsis.  He was started on
meropenem in the ICU and received 3 days for ? adequate
treatment previously.  His culture subsequently grew
enterococcus, resistant to ampicillin but sensitive to
vancomycin.  Plan to treat with a total of 7 days vancomycin
with follow-up urinalysis and urine culture off antibiotics.  He
has follow-up scheduled with urology on [**1-27**].
.
# h/o C. diff: Previously treated for full 2 week course of
flagyl.  Reports no additional diarrhea except in the setting of
his GI bleed.  C. diff negative x 1 this admission and no
further diarrhea. C diff B pending.
.
# CAD: s/p MI.  Holding aspirin in setting of GIB.  He reamined
HD stable so his beta blocker was reinstituted.  Would consider
restarting ASA in one month.
.
# CHF: Diastolic dysfunction. EF 60%. No evidence of CHF on
exam.
.
# Anemia: Previous studies c/w Fe deficiency likely from chronic
GIB.  Iron normal on this admission, low TIBC, normal ferritin
and transferrin.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Recent platelet baseline low 100s, but prior
to [**2123-11-19**] appears to have had normal platelet count.  Unclear
etiology as he does not appear to have been started on any new
medications.  Suspect BM suppression due to prior episode of
sepsis.  DIC panel without significant abnormalities this
admission and platelets remain stable.  Holding off on
PPI/Famotidine as above.
.
# CRI: Most recent creatinine has range 1.5-1.7.  He is
currently below this baseline at 1.3.
.
# COPD: No wheezing on exam.  Bibasilar crackles but CXR without
infiltrate.  Continued on tiotropium.
.
# Liver cysts: Incidental finding on abdominal CT.  Will need
outpatient workup.
.
# History of CVA [**2117**] with R sided weakness:  Aggrenox and ASA
have been held in the setting of his GI bleed.  This will need
to further evaluated in the setting of recurrent GI bleeds.
