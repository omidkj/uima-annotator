Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiogenic shock s/p STEMI and VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Intubation
Intracardiac Defibrillator implantation
Cardiac catheterization with placement of three bare metal
stents
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27063**] is 65 year-old man who does not regularly seek
medical care a history of myocardial infarction and pulseless
arrest five days prior to admission who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
early this AM for urgent CABG.  Mr. [**Known lastname 27063**] was in his usual
state of health until [**Known lastname 766**], [**11-13**].  On [**11-13**], after pt had
been complaining of 3d chest pain, he had witnessed cardiac
arrest.  His female companion, a retired nurse, initiated CPR
and performed until arrival of EMS 8-10min later.  Found to be
in agonal respirations, monitor showed VF, and pt was shocked
twice --> en route to hospital, noted asystole --> epi and
atropine --> A-fib --> amiodarone bolus --> ER, where intubated
(sats 84%), in cardiogenic shock with SBPs in 90s, then in VF
again, shocked once --> EKG revealed STEMI --> took to cath lab,
where stented BMSx3 to LAD.  Once opened LAD, went into VFib,
shocked 360J x1 and given amiodarone bolus 450mg.  Went to CCU
with intra-aortic balloon pump, and began cooling protocol.  CXR
at that time showed multifocal lobar PNA (presumed aspiration
PNA), and was started on Ceftriaxone and Unasyn.
.
On [**11-15**], pt was noted to have Torsades vs polymorphic VT, given
K and Mg, and shocked with 200J.  He was extubated [**11-17**].
Following extubation his family reports that his mental status
gradually improved to baseline on Thursday evening.  Early this
AM, c/o 10/10 chest pain.  EKG with ST elevatations in V1-4 -->
heparin, plavix, morphine, SL nitro x3, taken to cath lab, where
BMS placed to proximal LAD.  Then dissected mid LAD, which
required stenting of the dissected area.  It was presumed that
the culprit lesions were the proximal and mid LAD in-stent
thromboses.
.
Neurology was consulted after admission given concern for anoxic
brain injury.  They had been following, and daughter expressed
concern re: some difficulties with time perception (he thought
that hours were passing when only minutes had passed) on morning
of transfer.  RNs also noted him to be less conversant, mumbling
and unable to focus on their questions.
.
Note, pt also had episode of bloody secretions from OG tube at
OSH
.
Transferred to CCU for management of cardiogenic shock.
