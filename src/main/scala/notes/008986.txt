History of Present Illness:
(HPI obtained from [**Location (un) 1131**] notes from OSH as pt not able to give
history) 77yo F w/ a PMH of HTN, dementia, CRI, and recent
pacemaker placement who presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] with SOB and cough.
She was sent to rehab several days PTA after a week-long
hospitalization during which she had her pacemaker placed. She
had cough and SOB x few days prior to presentation. Per admit
note, she denied pleuritic pain, CP, palpitations, LE edema, or
hemoptysis. She did note a cough, but it was unclear if it was
productive or not. ROS was otherwise negative. Temperature on
admit was 97.9, BP 100/60, HR 90, RR 25, sats 100% on RA (?).
Initial exam was notable for moderate respiratory distress with
scattered wheezes and crackles at BLL. Initial CXR showed a
multilobar pneumonia. ABG was 7.29/44/53 with bicarb of 21. BNP
was 18,541. She was admitted to the ICU and treated with
rocephin (CTX), vanco, and azithromycin for pneumonia; lasix for
CHF; and solumedrol and nebulizers for COPD. Pulmonary was
consulted for help in management of her complicated respiratory
status. She had intermittent difficulty w/ SOB, with O2
requirements rising up to 6L nc. Labs and cultures were
initially unrevealing. She had an ECHO performed on [**2163-8-22**]
which showed global LV hypokinesis with an EF 30% and akinesis
of anterior wall, septum, and apex of LV. Estimated PCWP was 18.
There was also evidence of pulmonary artery hypertension. This
was felt to prove that CHF was part of her symptomatology, but
it was unclear why she had suffered such a problem with her
systolic function.
.
During her admission, her labs stayed relatively stable (other
than a slowly rising creatinine). She had two episodes of
stridor that resolved with solumedrol, racemic epinephrine, and
duonebs. ENT evaluated her looking for the etiology to her
stridor. She underwent a fiberoptic bronchscopy which showed
minimal blood in piriform sinuses, an excellent airway w/o
obstruction, and dry secretions in hypopharynx. It was felt that
the patient likely had secretions leading to a transient
obstruction and it was suggested that the patient have
aggressive humidification via face mask. On [**8-24**], because of the
lack of improvement in her symptoms, the patient was changed
from CTX to ceftazidime to cover pseudomonas. Cardiology was
consulted and recommended consideration of PE as a cause of her
hypoxia. Given her ARF, a CTA was not done but bilateral LENIs
were performed and were negative.
.
She was noted to go into respiratory distress on [**8-24**] w/
paradoxical breathing. ABG at that time was 7.34/34/61/18.
Concern was for PE so heparin gtt was started empirically. She
was soon after intubated due to her increased work of breathing
on [**8-24**]. She then had a R IJ placemed, during which the pt
developed a 10% apical PTX on the right. Serial CXR showed no
progression of the PTX over the remainder of her hospital stay.
Goal of ventilation was to keep her PEEP low and to increase the
FiO2. Surgery was consulted and felt that there was no need for
a chest tube given her clinical stability. On [**8-25**], the
patient's AM labs showed an INR >10 (with elev PTT) while on
heparin. She then had FFP infused to reverse her anticoagulation
(in addition to IM vitamin K). Heparin and coumadin were d/c.
There was an attempted diuresis of 500cc negative but her Cr
continued to rise. Her amiodarone was discontinued over concern
of it contributing to her pulmonary dysfunction.  On [**8-26**], her
BP were elevated (SBPs in 170s) so a nitro gtt was added for
preload reduction. Pulmonary had been considering a bronch for
diagnostic purposes. The patient then began having bloody
secretions in her ETT which was felt to be due to her
coagulopathy and hemoptysis. Given ongoing complexity of her
multiple medical issues, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation and care.
.
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 7749**] had a recent hospital admission from [**8-11**] -
[**8-19**] for LH, dizziness -> found to have AV block, underwent dual
chamber pacemaker placement. There was also a concern for
pneumonia on admission CXR and she was treated with
vancomycin/zosyn for 7days (last dose on [**8-19**]).


Past Medical History:
# Asthma
# HTN
# Dementia
# CRI
# Paroxysmal afib - on amiodarone, coumadin (? off recently due
to PM)
- tachy-brady syndrome w/ 2:1 AV block

Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no history of alcohol abuse, drinks wine
occasionally.

ECHO [**2163-8-12**] (from previous hospitalization):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
70-80%). There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. There was no change in the left ventricular outflow
tract gradient with Valsalva maneuver. A mid-cavitary gradient
is identified. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically suggested, the
absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude
endocarditis.
.
IMAGING: (at [**Location (un) 620**])
[**2163-8-22**] CXR: There are new patchy opacities noted within the
right upper, right lower, left upper and left retrocardiac
region. There is new perihilar fullness associated with
indistinct bronchopulmonary vasculature likely reflects
underlying edema. The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable.
There are calcifications of the aorta present.  There is a new
ICD device in place with intact leads terminating within the
expected r
