Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopy
Banding of esophageal varices
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
53yoM with HepC but no known cirrhosis/varices, h/o EtOH who
presented initially to [**Hospital **] Hospital from [**Location (un) 89090**]correctional facility with abdominal pain and hematemesis
(bucket full). There, he was noted to have stable vitals signs
but guaic positive from below; Hct was 29.8, INR 2. He then had
a large bout of hematemesis and was given 2u PRBC's, 2u FFP,
intubated with Fent/Versed/Vecuronium, started on Octreotide gtt
and given 40 mg IV PPI (vs PPI gtt?) and 4mg IV Morphine x1.
In the ED, initial vitals: p105  142/77  15  100%. Never
hypotense in the ED.

Labs significant for: Hct 32.5, Plts 97, INR 1.9, fibrinogen
normal 231, free Ca 0.86, Lactate 2.6, Tbili 5.6, AST/ALT
140/51, and renal function 29/0.8. ABG 7.55 / 38 / 303 / 34 on
AC 100% PEEP 5, TV 500.

In the ED he was given 1L NS, 1g IV CTX, continued PPI
gtt/Octreotide gtt/Versed gtt/Fentanyl gtt. He had NGT placed
but was coiled in esophagus and so NGT was replaced and coffee
grounds were lavaged. No current bright red blood return. Stat
RUQ u/s was done which showed fatty cirrhotic liver, patent
portal and hepatic vasculature with appropriate flow directions,
extensive parahepatic varices, trace ascites, splenomegaly, and
2 right sided kidneys.

On exam here, he appeared to have sequelae of liver disease with
jaundice, distended abdomen, hepatomegaly; noted to have blood
in his NGT.

Endoscopy [**2108-7-8**]:
Impression: Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and
gastroesophageal junction (ligation)
Erythema, congestion and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach
compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
[**2108-7-7**] FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: An endotracheal tube
terminates 4.5 cm above the carina. Orogastric tube is coiled
within the esophagus. The heart size is normal. The hilar and
mediastinal contours are within normal limits. A left basilar
density may reflect an early consolidation. There is no
pneumothorax or pleural effusion
.
[**7-7**]    ABDOMEN U.S.
1. Coarsened, echogenic liver, compatible with cirrhosis. Trace
ascites.
Extensive parahepatic varices and splenomegaly signifying portal

hypertension. Patent portal and hepatic venous and hepatic
arterial flow, with appropriate flow directions.
2. Enlarged slightly heterogeneous pancreas. Correlate to
pancreatic enzymes to exclude pancreatitis.
3. Incidental finding of two right-sided kidneys.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary reason for hospitalization:
53yoM with HepC and newly diagnosed cirrhosis on RUQ u/s
without  known varices who presents with hematemesis, hepatitis,
coagulopathy.

Active Issues:
1.Hematemesis -- On admission pt was vomiting bright red blood,
c/f large volume blood loss.  He was transfused 3 units RBCs and
received FFP.  He was intubated to protect his airway and had an
endoscopy which revealed grade II-III varices.  The varices were
banded and the bleeding subsided.  He was treated with an
octreotide drip, IV PPI, and IV ceftriaxone for SBP prophylaxis.
 His Hct improved over the course of his admission, and he had
no further episodes of hematemesis. He completed five days
treatment courses with octreotide and ceftriaxone.  He continued
to have melena but this also resolved during his admission.  He
will need repeat endoscopy in [**2-16**] weeks and follow up with GI
specialist as outpatient (see scheduled appointments). He was
also started on Pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **] on discharge, as well as
sulcrafate to be continued for a total of 10 days.
.
2. Left upper lobe collapse, LLL pneumonitis: Seen incidentally
on CXR, likely [**2-15**] aspiration of blood vs GI contents in the
setting of hematemesis vs intubation.  His repeat CXR showed
interval re-inflation of the LUL but persistent small area of
opacification of the LLL.  He remained afebrile, breathing
comfortably and oxygenating well on room air, so clinical
suspicion for pneumonia was low.  Sputum cultures did not grow
organisms.
.
3. Cirrhosis -- likely [**2-15**] ETOH abuse given history and AST:ALT
ratio > 2.  He has several signs of chronic liver disease on
exam, including spider angiomata, palmar erythema, and palpable
liver edge below costal margin.  He was started on lactulose
TID, titrated to 3 BMs/day.  He should continue to follow up
with his GI specialist as an outpatient.
.
4. H/o ETOH: Pt stated that he had not consumed ETOH since
incarceration, which was 4 days PTA.  He was initially started
on CIWA scale to monitor for s/sx ETOH withdrawal, but after 2
days this was discontinued.
.
5. DVT prophylaxis: He was encouraged to wear pneumoboots to
prevent DVT as SC heparin was contraindicated in the setting of
acute bleed.
.
6. Diet -- His diet was gradually advanced as tolerated, and on
the day of discharge he was doing well with normal diet.
.
Chronic issues:
Asthma -- he remained stable on his home dose inhalers.
.
Hypertension -- no known home meds (although takes nadolol for
varices), BP remained well controlled throughout stay.
.
Transition:
He will need repeat endoscopy in [**2-16**] weeks for re-eval of
varices, as well as outpatient follow up with GI for his varices
and liver disease (see scheduled appointments).  He should
refrain from ETOH consumption, and minimize use of tylenol due
to his liver disease (no more than 2g/24 hours).  On discharge
he was afebrile and breathing comfortably, however if he
develops fever, SOB, or cough productive of green-yellow sputum
he should get repeat CXR due to his risk of pna f
