year-old gentleman with coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, ischemic cardiomyopathy,
diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation status post VVI in
the past.  The patient was initially admitted to the Surgical
Service for right lower quadrant pain, however, treated
conservatively with resolution.  The patient was now
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on [**2192-3-29**] for pacemaker
change to a biventricular pacer.

PROBLEM LIST:
1. [**Name2 (NI) 4957**]y:  The patient underwent biventricular
   pacer placement on [**2192-3-30**] after his INR was less than
   1.8.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The
   patient was treated with prophylactic antibiotics for skin
   flora with five doses of clindamycin given the patient's
   penicillin allergy for a total five-day course.  The
   patient did well with a new biventricular pacemaker and
   was discharged home with plans to follow up with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **].

   in the past.  The patient was without symptoms in the

   his pacemaker changed to a biventricular pacemaker.  The
   patient continued on lisinopril and digoxin.  The patient
   was clinically without signs of overload throughout his
   hospital stay.

1. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient's Coumadin was restarted
