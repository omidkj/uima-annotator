CXR [**9-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Endotracheal tube approximately 7 cm superior to the carina.
2. Multifocal pneumonia concerning for aspiration.
.
CT head [**9-22**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Hypodense region within the right posterior temporal lobe
with associated ex vacuo dilatation of the right occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
of the lateral ventricle, findings consistent with chronic
infarction.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CT head [**9-25**]
IMPRESSION:
1) Interval development of large left MCA distribution
infarction, with probable clot in the hyperdense proximal MCA.
There is no evidence of a hemorrhagic component.
2) Stable encephalomalacia in the right posterior temporal lobe.
.
CT head [**9-27**]
IMPRESSION: Evolving left MCA distribution infarction, with
slightly more edema and mass effect compared to the prior day's
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
/P: 83M with h/o CAD, HTN, DM found unresponsive and
hypoglycemic, now with multifocal pna concerning for aspiration,
large left MCA stroke
.
Pt was found down in the field with hypoglycemia and respitaory
failure.  He was intubated in the field and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care.  There he was found to be in septic shock due
to multi-focal PNA.  He had end organ damage to kidneys, heart,
lungs.  He was treated with levo, flagyl, vanco.  He was
maintained on mechanical ventilation and on pressors.  On
antibiotics he slowly improved from a respiratory standpoint.
His sedation and ventilation were weaned. After extubating the
patient he was found to be unresponsive to verbal/painful
stimuli.  He was also noted to have a new right sided facial
droop and he was not moving his right side.  CT head then
demonstrated a massive evolving left sided MCA infarct.  Neuro
stroke service was consulted.  Follow up CT showed progression
of the infarct as well as old right sided infarcts.  Neuro felt
his prognosis was extremely poor given the extent of his
infarct. Family meeting was held and the patient was made
DNR/DNI/CMO.  He was then transferred to the floor from the
MICU.  He was maintained on morphine, ativan, scopolamine,
tylenol for comfort.   Palliative care was consulted and it was
initially decided to transfer the patient to hospice.  However,
on the AM of anticipated transfer, it was noted that the patient
was having significant periods of apnea, though he exhibited no
signs of distress.  Transfer was placed on hold, and the patient
died later that afternoon.
