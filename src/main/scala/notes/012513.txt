History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] is a 71 year old man with severe COPD, oxygen
dependant complicated by polycythemia, who was in his usual
state of health when he ran out of oxygen at a Red Sox game. His
son in law went to car to retrieve another gas tank and
meanwhile the patient was with out O2 for approximately 15 min.
His son called for help and EMS arrived with their own O2. At
that time, Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] was not mentating well, placed on
stretcher and then went into respiratory arrest. The patient
went limp and they started bagging patient. He was then noted to
be in v fib arrest as well. He was given IV EPI with one shock
and placed back in rhythm. He was given lopressor for the
resulting sinus tachycardia. Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] was brought to this
facility for further care.

Chest CTA: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Dependent

emphysematous changes.

Of note, his CT head was negative.


Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiovascular: Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**]' v fib arrest was attributed to his
his prolonged hypoxia while without his O2. Upon admission the
patient received asa 500 mg PR, solumedrol 125 mg x1, levaquin,
lopressor, calcium carbonate, and propofol. He was admitted to
CCU for acute coronary syndrome and started on aspirin,
atorvastin, metoprolol and captopril. His EKG showed diffuse ST
segment depression that could either be consistent with global
hypoperfusion secondary to his arrest or to left main disease.
His cardiac enzymes were positive secondary to demand and to his
low blood pressure. Once past the acute event, his EKG
normalized. His echocardiogram was negative for tamponade and
showed an EF of >55%. His cholesterol panel was at goal with an
LDL of 63, so the statin was discontinued. Per outside records,
he had a stress echo in [**2116**] which showed no evidence of
ischemia or diliation. This indicates that he is unlikely to
have left main disease. He was optimized medically with aspirin
and beta blockade, which he [**Year (4 digits) 8337**] well despite his severe
COPD. The metoprolol was considered necessary in spite of the
relative contraindication as it is protective against
arrhythmias.

Pulmonary: In the CCU, Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] was intially hypercapnic and
acidotic. The hypercapnea resolved but he remained hypoxic,
likely from his pneumonia. He was sedated and intubated for
respiratory failure. His CTA was negative for a pulmonary
embolism. He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl for
aspiration pneumonia. He had  high white cell count (12) at
admission that increased once he was placed on steroid. His
leukocytosis may have been due to a combination of his
pneumonia, and the steroids. On hospital day 2, he was weaned
from the ventilator and given lasix for hypoxia. He was
extubated on hospital day 3 and placed back on O2 via nasal
cannula. He [**Known lastname 8337**] this well except for a few asymptomatic
desaturations to the 70s. His levofloxacin was discontinued
after one dose because of the potential for it to cause QT
prolongation. He was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for
his presumed aspiration pneumonia. His therapy was optimized
with a steroid taper and albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer
treatments.

FEN: Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8337**] his feeds as soon as he was extubated.
He was placed on a cardiac diet.

Musculoskeletal: Mr. [**Known lastname 58184**] is deconditioned and spends a good
deal of his time in bed per patient. Physical therapy and
occupational therapy were consulted and recommended pulmonary
rehab.

He was discharged in fair condition to a pulmonary
rehabilitation facility in [**Location (un) 3844**] in fair condition.
