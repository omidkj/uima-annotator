Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall with right hip pain and fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open reduction internal fixation right valgus impacted femoral
neck fracture with 7.3 mm screws x3.


History of Present Illness:
73 year old woman with past medical history of IDDM, seizure
disorder and breast cancer who lives alone presenting with
right-sided hip, leg and low back pain after slipping off her
toilet this morning. Patient does not remember any other details
at this time. There were no witnesses, and it is not clear how
long she was down for.
.
In the ED, the intitial VS t 96.6 hr 109 bp 138/83 rr 15 and
pain was [**9-19**]. Physical exam showed pain with active and
passive R hip rotation. She was given 1g tylenol, 2mg IV
morphine and 2L NS. Evaluated by ortho. Imaging showed
subcapital femoral neck fx. Guaiac negative, cr 1.8 from b/l of
1.3. K+ 5.8->5.6, EKG notable for new T wave inversions in
V1-V4. A CT abdomen and pelvis showed urinary retention and a
foley catheter was placed. Perceived to have a somewhat altered
mental status although unclear baseline.


Past Medical History:
Seizure disorder (developed [**1-13**] DKA in [**2095**])
breast CA s/p mastectomy with prosthetic reconstruction ([**2107**])
IDDM
RA
HTN
glaucoma
bilat TKRs
.
Of note, neuropsych evaluation in [**2125**] commented that "her
marked attentional impairments raises concerns around her
safety, medication compliance, and other areas of functional
vulnerability."


Social History:
Social History: Lives alone. Ambulatory at baseline.
- Tobacco: none
- Alcohol: none

RADIOLOGY:
R Hip Films: [**2128-2-13**]
FINDINGS: There is a nondisplaced, slightly impacted right
subcapital hip
fracture. No other fractures are identified. Mild degenerative
changes
involving the SI joints and lumbar spine are noted. There is a
normal bowel
gas pattern.
IMPRESSION: Right subcapital hip fracture as described above.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**2128-2-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Right subcapital hip fracture.
2. Fibroid uterus.
3. Distended bladder with mild left pelvic fullness.
4. Bilateral adrenal gland thickening, left greater than right.
.
CT HEAD [**2128-2-13**]
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CT C-SPINE [**2128-2-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above.
3. Lung apices suggestive of edema, inflammatory, or small
airways disease, vs infectious process.
4. 6mm peripherally calcified right thyroid nodule for which
further
evaluation with ultrasound.
.
EKG [**2128-2-13**]
Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. There is a late
transition with Q waves and ST-T wave changes in the anterior
leads consistent with probable prior anterior myocardial
infarction. There are tiny R waves in the inferior leads
consistent with possible prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing ST segment changes are new.
.
CXR [**2128-2-13**]
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
R HIP FILMS [**2128-2-16**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-13**], views from the
operating suite show placement of three metallic screws across
the previously described fracture of the femur.
.
[**2128-2-16**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global
hypokinesis. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small
left ventricular cavity size with preserved systolic function.
.
[**2038-2-16**] CAROTID ULTRASOUNDS
IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal
carotid
arteries bilaterally.
.
[**2128-2-17**] CXR
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-16**], there has been a
substantial decrease in the bilateral opacification, which had
been more prominent on the left and could have represented
either asymmetric pulmonary edema or diffuse aspiration. Some
residual areas of opacification are seen at the right base
laterally and at the left base. These most likely represent
residual aspiration or possible atelectasis.
.
[**2128-2-18**] EKG
Normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the right precordial leads
consistent with anterior wall myocardial infarction. Q waves in
the inferior leads consistent with inferior myocardial
infarction. Compared to tracing #2 there is no change.


Brief Hospital Course:
73F PMHx of DM, seizure disorder and breast cancer, found down
on her floor with R hip fx s/p fall, admitted to the ICU with
hip fx, ARF, NSTEMI, and hypoxia. Hospital course by problem:

# Elevated Cardiac Enzymes and EKG Changes: Had elevated
troponins in the setting of [**Last Name (un) **] and new TWI both in the setting
of anemia. [**Hospital **] medical regimen included ASA 81mg, statin
80mg daily, and beta blocker. ACE-I was held given recent acute
on chronic renal failure and preserved EF as seen on echo (see
below).
.
# Right Hip Fracture s/p Fall.  Pt was evaluated by orthopedics
who planned for
minimally invasive pinning procedure pending medical clearance,
which was provided by daughter, [**Name (NI) 1785**], as pt was delirious.
Went to OR on [**2128-2-16**], no complications intra-op, but did go back
ot the ICU for o
