Brief Hospital Course:
54 yo F with h/o of severe asthma, CAD, HTN admitted for
monitoring after right total knee replacement.
.
# Repiratory distress/asthma: Ms. [**Known lastname 6633**] was intubated in the
OR and was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to be weaned off the ventilator
slowly overnight. She was able to be extubated the following
morning.  She was continued on albuterol given her history of
asthma. She received narcotics for pain control and was noted to
be in respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation several hours
after extubation. She was given narcan 0.4mg X2 and was started
on narcan gtt with good effect. She was briefly placed on bipap
during this episode and quickly weaned to room air with good O2
sats. She had a chest X-ray which was concerning for RLL PNA vs.
atelectasis. At the time, since she had a temp of 101, she was
started on levofloxacin for presumed PNA (7 day course). She was
also given an incentive spirometer to prevent atelectasis.  She
was breathing comfortably on room air w/ good O2 sat in the days
before discharge.
.
# CAD/Chest pain: Post extubation, Ms. [**Known lastname 6633**] had an episode of
chest pain. She was given SLNTG X 3, fentanyl 50 mcg X2, ASA and
was started on nitro gtt. The pain resolved after ~30 mins.
There were no EKG changes; however, given her history of CAD and
the fact that she had been off aspirin/plavix for 7 days pre-op,
there was significant concern for ACS. Cardiology was consulted
and recommended checking 3 sets of enzymes and restarting
ASA/plavix. She had another episode of chest pain, was given
ativan and was started on nitro gtt again briefly.  She was
changed to imdur and the nitro gtt was then discontinued.  Her
cardiac enzymes came back negative. She had another episode of
chest pain after her transfer to the floor. This was described
as being the same pain as she'd had previously.  EKG was
unchanged, and enzymes were negative.  Given that she had 90%
occlusion in the LAD s/p stent, she received a dobutamine stress
test which was negative (although low quality study).  She had
no further episodes, and her cardiologist was made aware of
these events.  She was continued on her cardiac meds prior to
discharge.
.
# Anemia: Unclear etiology. In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Ms. [**Known lastname 6633**] had an episode
of emesis after receiving narcan. The emesis was brown, so she
[**Known lastname 1834**] an NG lavage which was clear. She received 1u PRBC in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with appropriate response in hematocrit.  On the floor,
her Hct continued to trend down and reached 23.7. She was
transfused 2u PRBC with an appropriate response. Her Hct
remained stable for the remainder of her hospital course.
.
# TKR: [**Hospital Unit Name **] surgery continued to follow the patient and
make recommendations for her wound care and rehab. Her knee was
placed in a continuous motion device and she was seen by
physical therapy who began working with the patient on POD#3.
She continued to improve, and she was given a knee immobilizer
to be worn for at least 6 hours a day.  She will also continue
to receive lovenox for 2 weeks and have follow up with ortho in
1 month.
.
# Pain: She had an epidural catheter initially. Given that she
hypoventilated on narcotics, she was given standing percocet and
tylenol with prn oxycodone once the cathether was removed. She
was monitored carefully for sedation given the episode of
oversedation that occurred in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Her pain was
well-controlled on this regimen.
.
# FEN: Advanced to regular, cardiac, heart healthy diet. Lytes
were checked daily and were repleted prn.
.
# Access: PIV
.
# Prophylaxis: She was given SC lovenox, bowel regimen, PPI.
.
# Code: Full
