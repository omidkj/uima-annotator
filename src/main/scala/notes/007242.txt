Service:  ACOVE MEDICINE

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
man with a long history of intermittent lower GI bleed
believed secondary to diverticulosis and hemorrhoids (as seen
on colonoscopy in [**2177-4-2**]) who had been having some
rectal bleeding.  His hematocrit dropped to 27.  He then
received 2 units of packed red blood cells at his
rehabilitation facility on the day of admission.  At this
time, he was noted to become more dyspneic.  The patient was
given Lasix, however, did not respond.  He was, therefore,
sent to the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, an initial ABG was 7.23/80/49.
There was a trial of noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation but the patient did not improve.  Therefore, he
was intubated.  A chest x-ray taken at this time showed
congestive heart failure with a right lower lobe effusion.
The patient was suctioned and this revealed thick pus.  In
the Emergency Department, the patient was given ceftriaxone 1
gram and azithromycin 1 gram.  He was also given 15 mg of
Kayexalate for a potassium of 5.5 in the setting of acute
renal failure with a BUN of 55 and creatinine of 2.3 up from
a baseline of 1.2.  A subclavian line was placed in the
Emergency Department.

After intubation, the patient's blood pressure dropped
briefly to a systolic of 70s.  It increased with 100 cc bolus
of normal saline.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for
further management.  The patient also received 120 mg of
Lasix IV in the Emergency Department.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.
However, Percocet and codeine cause delirium and confusion.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was working part-time as an
accountant up until his hip fracture in [**2177-12-3**].  He
has a 70 pack year history of smoking and quit in [**2141**].  The
patient rarely drinks alcohol.  He is married.  His health
care proxy is his son in-law, [**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8732**], phone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 8733**].  He currently was at rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 5595**] and
his family is looking into long-term care options as his
mobility is severely limited since his hip fracture.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for myocardial infarction.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
95.2, blood pressure 133/45, heart rate 50, respiratory rate
22, saturating 60% on room air.  The patient was then
intubated and had a blood pressure of 111/49, heart rate 55,
respiratory rate 12, saturating 100% on AC 500 times 12 with
a PEEP of 5.  General:  The patient was sedated and
intubated.  He responded only to pain.  HEENT:  The pupils
were 2 mm and reactive bilaterally.  The head was
normocephalic, atraumatic.  JVD 10 cm at 30 degrees.  The
tympanic membranes were normal.  There was no lymphadenopathy
in the head or neck.  Pulmonary:  Coarse bronchial breath
sounds and rhonchi scattered bilaterally.  Heart:  The heart
rate was bradycardiac.  The rate was regular.  There was a
summation gallop.  There were no murmurs.  Abdomen: Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Bowel sounds were present.  There
was ecchymoses bilaterally in the lower quadrants likely from
Lovenox.  Extremities:  There was 2+ pitting edema.  There
was no clubbing or cyanosis.  The dorsalis pedis pulses were
2+ bilaterally.  The patient had a sacral decubitus ulcer.
The right hip surgical scar was well healed.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 15.9, hematocrit 40.0,
platelets 218,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 5.5, chloride 98,
bicarbonate 30, BUN 55, creatinine 2.3, glucose 108.  PT
13.1, INR 1.1, PTT 32.4.

The urinalysis showed a small amount of blood, 30 protein,
negative glucose, negative ketones, negative leukocyte
esterase, negative nitrates.  The pH was 5.0.  There were [**2-4**]
red blood cells, 0 white blood cells, and occasional
bacteria.

An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 50 beats per minute.
There was left axis deviation.  There was a possible old MI
with Q in V1.  There was T wave flattening in III and aVF.
There was a prolonged QT interval of 500.  There were U waves
in the precordium.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy opacities with a right
pleural effusion with the diagnosis of congestive heart
failure versus multifocal pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially
intubated and transferred to the ICU.  His respiratory
failure was felt to be multifactorial.  However, pneumonia
seemed most likely.  The patient was also noted to have
impaired pulmonary function at baseline secondary to COPD.
The patient was initially started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone
and azithromycin for treatment of pneumonia.  Sputum culture
eventually grew out MRSA.  The patient's effusion was not
amenable to tap.  It was evaluated by ultrasound and felt to
be nontappable.  Therefore, the patient did not have a
thoracentesis.

The patient was maintained on intubation and ventilation.  He
was also maintained on inhalers for his COPD.  The patient
was extubated on [**2178-2-27**] and did well from a pulmonary
point of view.  He was called out to the floor on [**2178-2-28**].

That evening, the patient was given his evening medications
and was noted to aspirate.  The patient desatted to the 60s
on a nonrebreather mask.  He became unresponsive.  The
patient was then intubated for likely aspiration and
transferred back to the ICU.  The patient was maintained on
his antibiotics.  He did well in the ICU from a pulmonary
point of view and was then extubated on [**2178-3-3**].

He was transferred to the floor on [**2178-3-4**].  The
patient's mental status was noted to be quite changed after
his second extubation.  He failed a swallow study and was
kept n.p.o.  He seemed to be doing well from a pulmonary
point of view.  However, the patient, after much discussion
with his family, was made DNR/DNI.  He was then found
deceased in the early morning of [**2178-3-7**].  It is
thought that he may have passed away from a pulmonary event.

2.  RENAL:  The patient was noted to be in acute renal
failure on admission.  This was felt to be secondary to
overdiuresis.  The patient was given IV normal saline and his
renal function
