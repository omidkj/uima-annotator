Admission Date:  [**2123-6-8**]       Discharge Date:  [**2123-6-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2091-2-13**]       Sex:  M

Service:   Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 42954**] is a 32-year-old
gentleman with a longstanding history of mitral valve
disease.  He has had new onset atrial fibrillation.  An
echocardiogram in [**2122-11-25**] revealed dilated left
atrium with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, a
rheumatic-appearing mitral valve, with moderate mitral
stenosis, and moderate mitral regurgitation, and some
pulmonary hypertension.  The patient presented for mitral
valve repair by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2123-5-17**] which revealed normal coronary arteries, and a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 48%, and a pulmonary artery
pressure of 38/20.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history is significant
for)
1.  Mitral valve valvuloplasty in [**2092**].
2.  The patient also has a history of meningitis in the past
complicated by seizures and prolonged unresponsiveness.
3.  The patient his human immunodeficiency virus positive.
4.  Preoperative atrial fibrillation.
5.  Mitral stenosis.
6.  Mitral regurgitation.
7.  The patient also had a questionable neurologic event
which was evidenced by left ear deafness with visual
disturbances lasting very briefly (approximately five minutes
in length).  The patient's primary care physician felt it to
be a questionable transient ischemic attack versus an embolic
event, and he was started on Coumadin at that time.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications upon admission to the
hospital included)
1.  Coumadin 10 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Kaletra 150 mg p.o. twice per day.
3.  Epivir 150 mg p.o. twice per day.
4.  Viread 300 mg p.o. once per day.
5.  Bactrim one tablet p.o. once per day.
6.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. once per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
upon admission to the hospital was unremarkable.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory
values upon admission to the hospital were all within normal
limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was directly
admitted to the operating room on [**2123-6-8**] where he
underwent a mitral valve replacement using a 31-mm [**Company 1543**]
mosaic porcine valve as well as a maze procedure.

Postoperatively, the patient was in good condition and was
atrially paced at a rate of 90 per minute on an intravenous
propofol drip.  He was transported from the operating room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit off all intravenous
drips in good condition.

Later that day, the patient was noted to be in a normal sinus
rhythm.  His atrial pacing was discontinued, and he remained
in a normal sinus rhythm.  The patient was weaned from
mechanical ventilation and extubated on the night of surgery.

On postoperative day one, his chest tubes were discontinued.
The patient was transferred from the Cardiothoracic Recovery
Unit to the telemetry floor and begun ambulation and cardiac
rehabilitation.

On postoperative day two, the patient remained in a normal
sinus rhythm with a rate in the 90s.  His blood pressure was
in the 130s/70s and in no apparent distress.  The patient was
begun on oral Lopressor.

On postoperative day three, the patient had a temperature to
101 degrees Fahrenheit and remained in a normal sinus rhythm
in the 80s with a blood pressure of 110/69.  The patient had
a few crackles bilaterally (left greater than right) and was
encouraged to use incentive spirometry and increase physical
therapy and ambulation.  The patient's antiretroviral
preoperative medications had been resumed at that time.

On postoperative day five ([**2123-6-13**]) and Infectious
Disease Service consultation was obtained.  The patient
remained with intermittent fevers and was placed on
vancomycin and ceftazidime intravenously prophylactically
with the most likely source being pulmonary in origin;
although, we were unable to obtain a sputum sample for
culture.  The patient did have a left lower lobe opacity on
chest x-ray.  Cultures of blood and urine were sent and
subsequently returned as negative.  The patient's sternal
incision has remained clean and dry with a very small scabbed
over area in the center of it.  There has been no drainage.
His sternum has been stable, and there was no erythema on any
aspect of the incision.

The patient remained on vancomycin and ceftazidime
intravenously through today ([**2123-6-15**]).  The patient
underwent an echocardiogram on [**6-14**] which was unremarkable
and did not show any signs of endocarditis.  The patient has
not had subsequent positive blood cultures postoperatively.

The patient's last fever was 100; which was at 4 p.m. on [**6-14**].  He has remained afebrile since then.  Since the patient
had remained afebrile for 24 hours, it was felt appropriate
that he may be discharged home today (on postoperative day
seven).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Physical examination on
discharge was as follows; temperature was 98.6 degrees
Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 121/74, heart rate was 76 in a
normal sinus rhythm, respiratory rate was 18, and oxygen
saturation was 93% on room air.  The patient's lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally with the exception of a few
crackles in his left base.  His incision, as previously
described, was clean with no drainage and no erythema.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to home.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to be discharged to home on levofloxacin
with instructions to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] office for any
temperature above 100.5 or any signs of infection.
2.  The patient was to follow up with his primary care
physician (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) in one to two weeks.
3.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
in four weeks for a postoperative check.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice per day.
 2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once per day.
 3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once per day (times seven days).
 4.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. twice per day (times

1.  Mitral stenosis.
2.  Mitral regurgitation.
3.  Status post mitral valve repair; maze procedure.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.
