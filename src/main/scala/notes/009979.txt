Past Medical History:
Onc Hx: Adenocarcinoma of Unknown origin (? GI/Cervical).  The
patient initially had presented in [**2188-12-9**] with vaginal
bleeding her vagina.  Her cervix was biopsied at Women and
[**Hospital 60658**] Hospital that showed malignancy involving her cervix and
was treated with external beam radiation therapy and
brachytherapy.  Her vaginal bleeding resolved, but in [**Month (only) 956**]
[**2189**] CT and PET scans showed multiple pulmonary nodules which
were biopsied and suggested metastatic carcinoma of likely
gastrointestinal tract origin and in [**2189-8-8**] she was found to
have residual disease involving her cervix.  The patient then
was seen at the [**Hospital6 8865**] where she was seen
by both the gastrointestinal oncology team as well as the
gynecological oncology team.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and gynecological
oncology mentioned to the patient that she was not a candidate
for surgical resection of her disease because of the wide spread
metastases on her CT of the chest.  The treatment of her
metastatic malignancy of likely gastrointestinal origin began
fall of [**2189**] and consisted of FOLFOX with Avastin to begin,
followed by FOLFIRI with Avastin. In [**2190-3-11**], her
treatment with FOLFIRI plus Avastin had to be held because she
underwent toe amputations related to her diabetes mellitus.
Tumor markers inc. CA [**82**] and CEA were rising, suggesting
refractoriness to FOLFIRI, and she was switched to FOLFOX in in
[**2190-4-8**], to which she responded favorably.  In [**2190-7-9**], the
patient noted recurrence of her bleeding vaginally, and the
patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of gynecology oncology who felt
that there was no possible benefit that could be obtained from
local therapy or surgical options regard to her pelvic
involvement.  In [**2190-10-9**], she started dialysis
treatments; the etiology of her ESRD is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **]
chemotherapy has been held the last few months due to multiple
admissions for pneumonia/COPD exacerbation.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-12-7**]
IMPRESSION: Diffuse patchy parenchymal opacifcation with
effusions without prior for comparison. Diagnostic
considerations are extensive but include edema, multifocal
pneumonia, sarcoid, and ARDS.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old female with multiple medical problems including DM2,
COPD, recent MRSA and pseudomonas pneumonia, and metastatic
adenocarcinoma of unclear primary (cervical v. GI), who
presented with increased dyspnea, attributed to COPD
exacerbation and pneumonia.
.
1.  SOB:  Pt was initially admitted to the ICU.  She does have
multiple contributing factors including COPD, MRSA pneumonia,
HD-dependence, and presence of metastases in lung.  ICU team
also felt there was a significant component of anxiety as the
dyspnea responded well to ativan and morphine.  Also, her ABGs
were not significantly abnormal, and she satted well on NC but
insisted on having a face mask.  It was not felt that she had a
PE as LENIs were negative and there was no sig. RV strain on
ECHO.  Induced sputum was neg. for PCP but grew MRSA.  She was
treated with vancomycin and meropenem for 14 days for pneumonia.
 She was also treated with nebulizers and solumedrol and HD as
needed for volume-overload.
.
2.  ESRD:  Pt continued dialysis, calcium carbonate, lanthanum,
and nephrocaps per Dialysis Team.
.
3.  Adenocarcinoma:  Given pt's poor functional status,
chemotherapy was held.  Pt did report sig. pelvic pain.
Radiation oncology was consulted and did not feel that the
patient was a candidate for radiation therapy.  Her pain was
controlled with Fentanyl patch and dilaudid PCA.
.
4.  HTN: Labetalol was restarted in the ICU for SBP in
150-180's, and her BP responded well.
.
5.  DM II:  Pt was placed on a ISS while in house.
.
Pt began to have worsening functional and mental status, and
after discussion with her family, her goals of care were shifted
to comfort.  She died on [**2190-12-21**].
