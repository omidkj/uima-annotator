HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Transplant
Surgery Service for pancreas and kidney transplant.  The
patient underwent the procedure on hospital day number two,
postoperative day number one.  The patient was continued on
1:1 replacement and continued on the immunosuppressive
Solu-Medrol, MMF, ATG.  The patient continued to have a good
urine output without any difficulties.  The patient had a NG
tube placed, kept n.p.o.  The patient's laboratories revealed
that her creatinine was down to 1.0.

On postoperative day number two, the patient complained of
soreness in the throat with having the NG tube.  The patient
remained afebrile with stable vital signs and her blood
sugars were between 103 and 112 and under excellent control.
The patient continued to make good urine.  The patient's
immunosuppressives included ATG, Solu-Medrol.  The patient
was continued on a heparin drip.  The patient's IV fluids
were switched to 0.5 cc per 1 cc output replacement.  The
patient was continued on n.p.o. with NG tube placed.

On postoperative day number three, the patient had a Guaiac
positive diarrhea.  The patient continued to be afebrile with
stable vital signs.  The patient was kept n.p.o. with a NG
tube in place.  The patient's heparin drip was stopped and IV
fluids changed to 150 cc per hour.

The patient had a crit drop to 27 from 39.  The patient was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring for acute GI
bleeding.  The patient also received 2 units of packed red
blood cells, 2 units of FFP, and 1 unit of cryo.  The patient
was stabilized in the ICU.

On postoperative day number four, the patient did well in the
ICU setting and was stable with a hematocrit of 29.  The
patient's pain was well controlled with morphine PCA and good
stable creatinine.  On postoperative day number five, the
patient continued to do well in the ICU setting.  The
patient's creatinine was 0.3.  The patient's hematocrit was
stabilized at 32.3.  The NG tube was removed and the patient
was transferred to the floor.

On postoperative day number six, the patient had a bowel
movement without any blood.  The patient remained afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient continued to do well
and was Hep-Locked and advanced to a regular diet.

On postoperative day number seven, the patient complained of
having a hard time sleeping.  The patient remained afebrile
with stable vital signs.  On examination, the patient had
some serous fluid draining from the wound without any signs
of dehiscence.  The patient was put on Dulcolax and placed on
magnesia to help with her bowel movements.  Also, she was put
on some Ambien p.r.n. to help with sleep.

On postoperative day number eight, the patient continued to
have good urine output.  We obtained a CT of the abdomen to
assess the wound edge and it confirmed that there were no
signs of dehiscence.  The patient had an ultrasound-guided
paracentesis of the fluid which improved her symptoms
dramatically and decreased the amount of serous fluid
production from the abdomen.

On postoperative day number nine, the patient complained of a
sore throat and remained afebrile with stable vital signs
with good blood sugar control.  We put the patient on Cepacol
for a sore throat.  The patient was started on some IV fluids
for low blood pressure.

On postoperative day number ten, we obtained a consult from
ENT to evaluate a sore throat.  They stated that the sore
throat was due to the presence of some irritation due to the
presence of NG tube.  There was no need for treatment and
would improve in approximately a week.

On postoperative day number 11, the patient remained afebrile
with stable vital signs except for perhaps a low blood
pressure without any symptoms.  The patient had no serous
fluid draining from the abdomen.  The patient was doing well.
The patient was put on Augmentin for 14 days to rule out any
causes for wound infection.  The patient's CBI was removed
and was discharged home.
