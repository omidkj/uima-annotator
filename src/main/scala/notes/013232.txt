appear to be in pain
HEENT: Pupils: PERRL      EOMs-intact
Neck: Very kyphotic, but no tenderness to palpation.

Upon discharge:
Exam unchanged


Pertinent Results:
MRI [**12-22**]:
The study is partially limited by motion artifacts. Allowing
these
limitations, the previously described right cerebellar mass is
again
visualized. The mass now measures 29 x 21 mm compared to 18 x 23
mm prior,
representing interval increase in size. In pre-contrast axial T1
images,
there is a hyperintense center with hypointense surrounding.
There is evidence of interval reduction of surrounding edema,
likely resolving edema from the [**2107-10-27**] biopsy. Again seen is
enhancement in the cerebellar sulci, representing leptomeningeal
seeding from the tumor.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right cerebellar mass, with appeareance of a malignant
hemorrhagic tumor, consistent with the known biopsy finding.
Interval increase in size. Decreased surrounding parenchymal
edema.
2. Persistent evidence of leptomeningeal seeding to the right
cerebellar
sulci.

Result of video swallow evaluation [**12-27**]:
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The safest recommendation is for the pt to remain NPO, as no
consistencies are without aspiration.
2. However, if the pt and his HCP wish to allow him to eat
against these recommendations given that the goals of care are
now hospice related, I would suggest a diet of honey thick
liquids and pureed solids, as these will result in the least
amount of aspiration.
3. Meds crushed with puree only until discussion with pt and HCP
regarding goals.
4. Q4 oral care.

On [**12-29**]:
K 3.2

On [**12-30**]:
K 4.0


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was adirect admit from an OSH for increased size of
his cerebellar mass. He was in the ICU until a stepdown bed
became available for him. The patient was neurologically stable
for his stay here. He was evaluated by medicine for complete
heart block. The EP team did not recommend a pacemaker due to
his prognosis. They also requested that he did not be given any
beta blockers, given his heart block. The medical team did not
recommend any follow-up with them after discharge.

Mr. [**Known lastname 61509**] was transferred to a regular floor since he was
neurologically stable and since there were no interventions for
his heart block. It was determined that he would not undergo any
neurosurgery during this hospitalization. Palliative care was
consulted who recommended longterm care placement for comfort
care. PT and OT evaluated him and agreed with the plan.
Speech/swallow did a video swallow evaluation and recommended a
modified diet for comfort.

On [**12-29**] he was ready for discharge however his potassium was
low. Due to pharmacy delays he did not receive his potassium
repletion until the afternoon and this was too late for him to
be transferred. Therefore on [**12-30**] in the morning he was
discharged.
