Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
AICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion with sedation


History of Present Illness:
He presented to [**Hospital6 17032**] [**7-13**] with nausea,
vomitting, chills and stable VTach on ECG. He became
hypotensive, was loaded and put on a drip of amiodorone for
TVach, and was admitted to the ICU. 1/4 bottles were positive
for E. coli. CXR showed an early right base infiltrate. ICD was
interrogated, programmed to a lower pacing rate of 75bpm, and
the VT detection was increased to cycle lengths of 420msec.
BBlocker was stopped that admission per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**]. He was
d/c home [**2167-7-16**] on levofloxacin 500mg daily with an expected 14
day total course, and Lasix 40mg daily for 1 week. He returned
to the NVMC ED late that evening due to 9 episodes of ACID
firing. On his arrival with EMS he had witnessed VTach and
appropriate AICD shock. He was afebrile, HR 117, RR 22, BP
157/80, and sat 94%; labs were unremarkable. Patient states that
there was no "warning" and felt well before ACID firing. He was
amiodorone loaded, started on a drip, and transefered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. AICD fired 3 times in the ED, but there
were not further episodes as of 7am [**7-16**]. ECG showed AFib with HR
in the 120s.

CXR [**2167-7-17**] No pneumonia or CHF. Appearance of right upper lung
vague
nodule. Recommend repeating the study with standard PA and
lateral view when the patient can tolerate.
CXR [**2167-7-19**] In comparison with study of [**7-17**], there is little
change. Again
there is the vague suggestion of a right upper lung nodule that
could well
represent progressive scarring. Further evaluation would require
CT scanning.
.
Blood Cx [**7-13**] at NVMC: [**1-19**] bottle (+) for E coli; sensative to
TMP/SMX, Amox/clavulonate, amp/sulbactam, cipro and levo;
resistant to amp, cetriaxone, cefzolin, and cefuroxime


Brief Hospital Course:
89yo M with AICD placed s/p VFib arrest, CAD s/p CABG, and AFib
recently d/c from OSH after being treated for E. coli bacteremia
who presented after multiple AICD firings.

#AICD firings: Subsided after initiation of amiodorone drip. Pt
switched to home dose of po amiodorone after drip completed. 3
sets of cardiac enzymes have been unremarkable and there were no
new ECG changes. It was suspected that episodes of AFib were
triggering VTach and thus the AICD shocks were appropriate. He
had perviously been cardioverted to NSR. He is on longstanding
anticoagulation and is therapeutic on coumadin, so cardioversion
in the setting of sedation was considered safe. Pt was
successfully cardioverted day 2 of admission. Patient will be
d/c home with f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].
.
# E. coli bateremia: Switched from Levaquin to Unasyn to avoid
risk of QT prolongation. Right lung process noted on CXR is
unlikely to be a source of a gram (-) bacteremia. Urine was
negative. Intrabdominal process was suspected at OSH, but no
abdominal imaging done. ID recommended changing to abx to better
cover ESBL. Called micro lab at OSH and E. coli was sensative to
ertapenam. Patient felt well throughout admission. PICC was
placed for a 2 week course of IV abx at home. Home VNA will be
arranged.
.
# amiodorone - Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had multiple IV doses of amio as
well as his home po dose over the past few days. Normal TSH.
Patient will be d/c on his prior home dose of amiodorone.
.
# CAD: S/p CABG. No c/o chest pain or SOB. No increase incardiac
enzymes as noted above. Continue home statin and ASA.
.
# CRF: Cr was at baseline of low 1s throughout admission
.
# lung nodule: First incidentaly found on CXR at OSH. Was stable
on lung films x2 during admission here. Pt should have CT scan
as an outpatient for further evaluation.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname **],

You were transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU because your debrillator
(ICD) shocked you numerous times.  We cardiovertered you because
we believe that this will prevent the heart rhythms which caused
the shocks.

We have not changed any of your heart medications. You should
continue to take them as prescribed.

We obtained records pertaining to your blood infection and
changed your antibiotics. Please start taking ertapenem and
please discontinue levofloxacin.  Please make an appointment
with Dr. _____ for further evaluation of the source of this
infection.


Followup Instructions:
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1918
