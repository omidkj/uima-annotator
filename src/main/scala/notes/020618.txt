minimal dyspnea with moderate activity. Given the severity of

Pertinent Results:
[**2173-1-20**] Carotid Ultrasound: There is less than 40% stenosis
within the left internal carotid artery. There is no evidence of
significant stenosis in the right internal carotid artery. Both
vertebral arteries presented antegrade flow.
.
[**2173-1-20**] Cardiac Catheterization: Right dominant. No
angiographically-apparent coronary artery disease.
.
[**2173-1-21**] Intraop TEE:
Pre Bypass:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale
is present. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall contractility. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Isolated
P2 flail.
Post Bypass:
The patient is s/p Mitral valve repair with a 28 [**Doctor Last Name **]
annuloplasty band. The cardiac index is 3.1. The band is well
seated with no peri or paravalvular leaks seen. The mean
gradient across the valve is 5 mmHg. The EF is preserved at
>55%. Aorta is intact post deccannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent further preoperative
evaluation. Cardiac catheterization showed clean coronary
arteries while carotid ultrasound revealed less than 40%
stenosis within the left internal carotid artery. Workup was
otherwise unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. The
following day, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed mitral valve repair along
with closure of PFO - for surgical details, please see operative
note. Given inpatient stay was less than 24 hours, Cefazolin was
given for perioperative antibiotic coverage. Following surgery,
he was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. He was started on betablocker, lasix, statin and ASA
therapy. He experienced post-operative afib and was treated w/
IV amio with conversion to SR. Amio was d/c'd. CT and pacing
wires were removed. He was transferred to the stepdown unit for
ongoing post operative care. Had subsequent recurring but self
limited bouts of afib and his betablocker was increased. He was
started on coumadin therapy. Post-operative pain was well
controlled with tylenol and occasional percocet. He was
evaluated by physical therpay for strength and conditioning and
was cleared for discharge to home on POD#4.
