Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary catheterization - stents x 2 to graft to OM2 and LAD.


History of Present Illness:
72 yo M h/o 3VD s/p CABG in [**2171**] (cath in [**2181**] with chronically
occluded SVG to OM1), HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, DM (diet
controlled), and CRI presents as tx from [**Hospital3 1443**] for
CP. The CP began Mon morning ([**10-30**]) while the pt was in bed. He
describes one week of angina with increasing frequency that
responded to nitro 1-2 tabs SL. The angina was generally
associated with exertion, though some episodes occurred while
the patient was in bed. He called EMT's on Monday because the
pain did not respond to nitro SL x 3. At [**Hospital3 1443**] he
was found to have EKG with ST depression in inferior and
anterior leads and a trop I of 0.47 (0.04 ULN). He had an
episode of CP at OSH that resolved with SL nitro x 1. He was
tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**] for coronary cath on [**10-31**]. On the morning of
[**10-31**] he went to cath and was stented in his graft to OM2 and
his LAD distal to the LIMA touch down with good restoration of
flow. (SVG to OM1 remained occluded.) EKG changes were resolving
but not gone. After catheterization, when the sheath was pulled,
the pt had a vagal episode that did not resolve with atropine
promptly. He was started on dopa for pressure and was taken back
to the cath lab as he developed substernal CP in the face of EKG
changes re-emerging. In the cath lab he was noted to have patent
stents. No further intervention was done.
.
The patient had a Creat of 2.0 from OSH - he received 180cc
contrast in first cath and 30cc in second cath.

EKG: [**10-31**] - pre-cath:
Sinus bradycardia. Inferolateral T wave inversions with ST
segment depression consistent with an acute ischemic process.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2183-5-4**] no definite change.

Cardiac Cath #1:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
three vessel native CAD, a patent LIMA, a chronically occluded
SVG to
OM1 and a stenotic SVG to OM2.  The LMCA had diffuse mild
disease. The
LAD had a subtotal ostial occlusion and was totally occluded
after the
first septal branch.  The distal vessel filled by a patent LIMA
but
there was an 80% native LAD lesion after the touchdown of the
LIMA.
There was a very distal 80% apical lesion.  The Lcx had severe
diffuse
disease throughout its length and in its branches.  It was
occluded
after the OM2.  The distal vessel filled via left to left and
right to
left collaterals. The SVG to Om1 was known to be occluded. The
SVG to
OM2 had a distal 90% lesion within the SVG. The native LAD and
this SVG
were stented (see below).
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed normal central aortic blood
pressures.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD.
3. Occluded SVG to OM1
4. 90% stenosis of SVG to OM2.
.
.
Cardiac cath #2:
Stents Patent
.
.
EKG [**11-1**] - post-cath:
Sinus bradycardia. First degree atrio-ventricular conduction
delay.
P-R interval 0.24. Lateral T wave inversion with ST segment
depression.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2186-10-31**] repolarization
abnormalities are
somewhat less prominent.

.
.
Echocardiogram (Post-Cath):
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global biventricular systolic function..
Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Cardiac: 72 yo M with known CAD, s/p NSTEMI/ +troponin.
Admitted for cath from OSH.  During cath, had 2 vessel
intervention (LAD and graft to OM2).  Afterward, during sheath
pull, developed severe and symptomatic hypotension and chest
pain.  Pt was taken for re-look procedure. The stents were found
to be patent.  Overnight had dopamine weaned and BP remained low
normal.  The patient was initially very confused but gradually
became more oriented overnight.  HCT was stable. The next day,
metoprolol was started at low dose for cardioprotection and the
pat tolerated this well.  The patient was known to have
extensive 3VD, so was followed with daily ekg that showed
resolution of small ischemic area.  Echo showed a preserved EF,
small focal WMA, and no effusion.  CE's trended down (CK) while
troponins increased.  The patient diuresed well after the volume
load in the cath lab and was euvolemic at discharge.  The
patient has a history in his chart of A flutter and had an
episode of narrow complex tachycardia at this hospitalization
that probably represented AT.  This never recurred.  The patient
was treated for diastolic heart failure with intermittent
diuresis diet control, wt and BP monitoring.
.
# Hypotension: The pt was hypotensive after catheterization and
was on dopamine for pressor for 12 hours.  Thereafter pressures
were low stable.  Metoprolol was started at a low dose and
titrated up as BP tolerated.  The patient was changed back to
atenolol on discharge
