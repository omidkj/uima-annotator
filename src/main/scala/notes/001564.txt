     RADIOLOGY  Final Report

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2200-8-3**] 11:59

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Anoxic injury of brain?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with post CPR stroke
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Anoxic injury of brain?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: Status post CPR stroke. Evaluate for anoxic injury to
the brain.

Routine MRI of the brain without gadolinium was performed.

There are no comparison studies.

FINDINGS:

There is abnormal signal throughout the supra- and
infratentorial brain specifically, in the frontal and parietal
cortex, bilateral thalami and caudate nucleus and in the
cerebellum. The deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and cortical abnormalities likely
represent sequela of hypoxic ischemic injury. The cerebellar
diffusion abnormalities could represent watershed or embolic
ischemia. Abnormal signal is also seen in the right putamen.

There are also probable scattered small vessel ischemic sequela
in the subcortical white matter.

Intracranial flow voids appear to be maintained.

Bilateral mastoid opacification is seen. There is fluid pooling
in the nasopharynx and the nasal cavities, which may be related
to intubation.

IMPRESSION:

Findings likely relating to hypoxic ischemic injury and
watershed ischemia.

DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 12563**]
Approved: SUN [**2200-8-3**] 6:01 PM







Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2200-8-1**] to CSRU intubated and unresponsive with a poor
neurological status. Renal and neuro consults done as prognosis
was poor on triple pressor support. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed the
prognosis with the family and CVVHD was started initially for
continued support. On [**8-2**], he showed signs of anoxic brain
injury with possible ischemia. Cardioverted on the morning of
[**8-3**] for rapid AFib. MRI of the head on [**8-3**] showed diffuse
areas of infarct. He remained hypotensive despite pressor
therapy, and a family discussion was held with neurology and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Family decided to make the pt. DNR and he expired at
14:17 on [**8-3**].
