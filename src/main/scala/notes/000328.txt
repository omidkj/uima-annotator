Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p cath for NSTEMI, Vfib arrest, GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
central line placement
CVVH
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 64yo woman with DM, HTN, ESRD on [**Hospital 58910**] transferred to the CCU
service from the MICU s/p cardiac catheterization. The patient
was in her home the day prior to admission cooking when she felt
like she was going to pass out and then lost consciousness. EMS
came and found her to have a v-fib arrest. They defibrillated 7
times in the field and brought her to [**Hospital 63273**] Hospital
[**Telephone/Fax (2) 63274**]). Here she was shocked three more times.
She was found to be hyperkalemic with an EKG showing widened QRS
and peaked T waves. At the OSH, she was treated with insulin,
glucose, and bicarb for hyperkalemia (6.5) and was started on an
amiodarone drip.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] hemodynamically stable and
intubated. Here, she was found to have a K of 7, and was treated
with bicarb, Ca, insulin and glucose. She was dialyzed yesterday
night with improvement in her K to 4.4 and resolution of her EKG
changes. She was started on levophed for hypotension and was
noted to have an elevated WBC with a left shift. She was also
noted to have an elevation in cardiac enzymes (CK 1440->1348, MB
27-23, MBI 1.9-1.7, Trop 0.39) and new [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] cardiology was
consulted.
.
Cardiology recommended that she go for an urgent cardiac
catheterization. At cath, she was noted to have 3+ MR< LVEF of
40%, and severe inferior hypokinesis. She had a 90% mid-LAD
lesion, a 70% LCx lesion at the ramus, and a 100% proximal RCA
lesion. She had two stents placed to the mid-LAD, but during the
procedure she vomited coffee-ground emesis and the
catheterization was terminated. She had an OGT placed but she
chewed it and it was removed. She was admitted to the CCU
service.
.
Notably, she has a history of GIB in the past per her husband.
[**Name (NI) **] does not know any details, but said that this occurred while
she was on heparin and prevented her from getting a renal tx at
the time. She apparently did not need hospitalization for this
and the etiology was never discovered, per the husband.

Past Medical History:
h/o GIB in the past, as above
DM not on insulin since [**5-19**] infection
ESRD secondary to PCKD, with HD qMWF
s/p renal transplant several years ago
HTN, not medically treated since [**5-19**] infection
h/o line infection [**5-19**]

Pertinent Results:
**SELECTED STUDIES**

SPINE MRI:
IMPRESSION: Endplate irregularity and enhancement at T7-8 level
is suggestive of discitis. However, in the absence of soft
tissue changes or abscess, the findings are not specific. Dual
energy gallium/bone scan would be helpful for further
evaluation. Other changes as above.

MRI HEAD ([**10-6**]):
IMPRESSION: 1. Limited study consisting only of DWI and FLAIR
sequences. The signal abnormality involving both medial temporal
lobes, insula bilaterally, and cingulate gyri appears to have
progressed, and demonstrates abnormal signal on
diffusion-weighted imaging.
2. New high signal intensity in the CSF overlying the right
parietal lobe, incompletely assessed. A focal area of
non-herpetic meningitis cannot be excluded.

CXR: ([**10-7**]):
A single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates an
endotracheal tube with its tip at the clavicular heads. A
left-sided central venous catheter is present with its tip in
the IVC. No right-sided central venous catheter is evident. No
pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube is present with its tip in the
stomach. Right hilar contour is unchanged from previous study of
[**2137-10-4**]. Retrocardiac opacity and mild pulmonary edema remain
unchanged.

CAROTID US ([**10-7**]):
IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid
stenosis.

UE US ([**10-7**]): 1) No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or
collection.

Abd/pelvic CT ([**10-7**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for abscess.
2. Right kidney complex hyperdense lesion likely consistent with
renal cell carcinoma and less likely a complex hemorrhagic cyst.
3. Mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation.
4. Right lung nodule.
5. Splenic infarct.

ECHO ([**10-8**]):
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. No obvious evidence of endocarditis seen.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**2137-9-25**],
there has been no significant change.

EEG ([**10-8**]):
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to overall slowing suggestive of a
diffuse
moderate encephalopathy with superimposed bursts and runs of
sharp and
slow, spike and slow discharges suggesting marked increase to
irritability overall.

Brief Hospital Course:
* Hypotension - The hypotension could have been from infection,
cardiogenic shock, or medications; there were no signs of
hemorrhage/volume depletion or neurogenic compromise. The
patient remained persistantly hypotensive on levophed during her
2 week stay in the MICU, with the addition of vasopressin and
continued hypotension. She received antibiotics and antivrials
to treat possible infections; her MRI was suggestive of HSV
encephalitis although CSF cultures were negative, and only one
set of sputum cultures ([**9-28**]) were positive, with no positive
blood cultures. An abdominal CT showed no source of infection,
there was no pneumonia seen on chest x-rays and no sign of
thrombophlebitis on US. Her LFTs showed no suggestion of hepatic
or biliary infection. ECHOs showed good cardiac function, making
cardiogenic shock unlikely. After two weeks of no improvement in
her overall status, family discussions about goals of care and
code status were initiated. From the first conversation, her
family (husband and children) were adamant that she would not
have wanted continued mechanical support and probably would not
have wanted admission in the first place. She was made DNR/DNI
and, after continued discussions, CMO with withdrawal of pressor
support and antibiotics. After a time of extreme hypotension
(SBPs 20s) and bradycardia, and after further discussion with
her family, the ventilator was turned off and she passed away.
Her family declined an autopsy and the ME declined the case.
.
* Mental Status changes: After her first extubation in the CCU
the patient was noted to have an asymmetric neuro exam, with
concern for CVA but head CT negative. An MRI was suggestive of
temporal lobe enhancement suggesting HSV encephalitis and the
patient was maintained on acyclovir. An LP yielded no organisms
in culture. EEG showed severe encephalopathy without seizure.
After her reintubation in the CCU prior to transfer to the MICU,
the patient never regained a normal mental status.
.
* NSTEMI - On arrival in the MICU, the patient was s/p cath,
able to get stents in LAD before termination. Pt only on Reopro,
which was stopped, ASA and plavix. No heparin. ASA and plavix
were continued.
