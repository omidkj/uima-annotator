Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyperbilirubinemia, cirrhosis, ARF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
66 yo F with h/o HTN and gastritis transferred from [**Hospital 1263**]
Hospital for hepatology evaluation and possible ERCP. Pt
initially presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital in late [**Month (only) 958**] secondary
to increased jaundice, decreased appetite, and emesis. Her
bilirubin was found to be elevated but was d/c'd with OP
followup when as it started to trend down. She was readmitted on
[**2116-4-28**] with c/o increased jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia to 34.
Workup was significant for +antismooth muscle antibody 1:160 and
+[**Doctor First Name **] 1:160. MRCP did not show evidence of biliary ductal
dilation. Viral hepatitis workup was negative. Liver biopsy was
performed [**2116-4-30**] was nonspecific showing cirrhosis with
cholestasis. She was started on prednisone 60 mg QD on [**5-1**] for
presumed autoimmune hepatitis. That day, creatinine rose from
1.5 to 2.8 to 7.9 on [**5-4**]. Pt was noted to be anuric with low
BPs to the 80s. She ws thought to be hypovolemic and started on
IVF but d/c'd secondary to ?CHF/SOB. She was transferred to the
ICU on [**5-2**] for closer monitoring and started on HD by renal
through a right femoral catheter placed on [**5-3**]. It was thought
that her acute rise in creatinine was c/w ATN secondary to IV
contrast from a CT scan and hyperbilirubinemia. She was dialyzed
2 out of the past 3 days by renal. She was kept on lactulose
that was started a few days PTA. Anzemet was used for nausea.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her
cirrhosis and renal failure.
.
Per reports, she was in her USOH until [**3-30**] when she began to
feel tired, had decreased appetite, and jaundice. She had a
bilirubin on [**4-17**] which was 10.8. CT abdomen as an OP showed a
normal sized, lobulated liver suggestive of cirrhosis. There was
no focal abnormalities or biliary dilation. There was marked
hypertrophy of the caudate lobe but no pancreatic masses. There
was mild ascites and splenomegaly suggestive of mild portal
hypertension. There was mild GB wall thickening without signs of
gallstones. She had no c/o of F or abd pain. The patient was
electively admitted 4 days later with a bilirubin of 34.4.
.
In the patient's history, she has had a moderate elevation in
her liver enzymes in [**2100**] and had a liver biopsy at the [**Hospital1 10551**]. It showed mild steatosis, patchy portal inflammation
without significant piecemeal necrosis or fibrosis. She does
report 2 units of PRBCs 34 y ago with the birth of her daughter.
She reports drinking 3 ounces of wine twice per week. She has
never been a heavy drinker in the past. She is a retired nurse
and has had [**1-27**] needle sticks during her career. In [**2101**] she was
told that she had a fatty liver and LFTs were being monitored.
She takes 500mg-1gm/month for knee pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo F with PMH significant for HTN and UGIB in the past
transferred from OSH with cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinemia, and ARF
felt to be due to contrast from abdominal ct and
hyperbilirubinemia. She was treated with hemodialysis via a
right femoral catheter placed on [**5-3**] at OSH. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for ercp. Unclear etiology of cirrhosis. DDX
included autoimmune hepatitis, biliary cirrhosis, NASH and PSC.
Labs from OSH significant for +[**Doctor First Name **] and Anti smooth muscle
antibodies concerning for an autoimmune etiology. Liver biopsy
was nonspecific. Pt was initially started on prednisone 60 mg.
Other etiologies included viral hepatitis, acetaminophen, ETOH,
NASH, hemachromatosis. A liver duplex revealed a cirrhotic liver
with thrombosis or extremely slow flow within the portal vein. A
moderate amount of ascites,splenomegaly and a right renal cyst.
Hepatology was consulted. Upon review of her case, a liver
transplant consult was initiated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66602**] and a workup was
begun
