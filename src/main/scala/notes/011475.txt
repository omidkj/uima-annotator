Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11839**]
Chief Complaint:
Cord compression, esophageal cancer.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2150-12-11**]: Neurosurgery of the spine with T5, T6 and T7 bilateral
laminectomy, Anterior decompression with removal of disk
material and
soft tissue, Posterior instrumented fusion T4, T5, T6, T7 and T8
using pedicle screws, rods and cross-link (EBI spine array),
with Autologous graft and Allograft.
[**2150-12-17**]: IVC filter placement.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old male with PMH significant for squamous
cell esophageal cancer diagnosed in [**2149**], s/p 3 cycles of
cisplatin and 5FU and XRT, history of radiation pneumonitis,
history of SVT s/p ablation, who is transferred from [**Hospital **]
Hospital due to concern for cord compression and urgent
neurosurgical evaluation.
.
Patient was admitted to OSH on [**2150-12-7**] due to acute abdominal
pain and found to have a partial bowel obstruction. He improved
with conservative therapy. However, on the morning of [**2150-12-9**],
patient found to have inability to move his legs or feet. CT
scan was performed at 7:30PM on [**2150-12-9**] demonstrating severe
compression of the T6 vertebral body, resulting in a kyphotic
angulation of the spine, with significant retropulsion of bone
fragments into the spinal canal at this level, which reduces the
diameter of the spinal canal by approximately 50%.
.
Prior to his transfer, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of neurosurgery was consulted,
who believed that the chance for a neurologic recovery was very
low given the period between onset of symptoms and transfer for
evaluation. His prior workup is notable for history of
persistent tachycardia with heart rates in the 150s, with two
prior CTAs (one on [**2150-11-24**] and one on [**2150-12-4**]) both of which
were negative for PE.
.
Patient was directly admitted to the floor, but triggered upon
arrival due to HR in the 150s, which initially was sinus
tachycardia, but which quickly escalated to 210s with stable
blood pressures and oxygen saturations, with telemetry findings
consistent with SVT. Broke with 5mg IV lopressor X 1. Patient
was asymptomatic through his tachycardia.
.
On the floor, patient reports that he is anxious. He is able to
wiggle his toes but cannot move his thighs and his sensation is
gone from the mid thighs downward.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain.

mediastinum; s/p 3 cycles of cisplatin and 5FU and XRT then two
more cycles of chemo
- history of radiation pneumonitis

- compression of spinal cord level T6 secondary to fracture of
his T6 vertebral body

- s/p right nephrectomy
- cholelithiasis

Social History:
Married, lives with wife and son.

Family History:
No history of esophageal or renal cancer.

Physical Exam:
ADMISSION EXAM:
Vitals: T: 97.8, BP: 141/107, P: 153, R: 22, O2 sat: 97%RA.
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Decreased breath sounds in the bases, no wheezes or
rales.
CV: Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema
Neuro: A+O X 3. CN 2-12 intact. Decreased rectal tone. No spinal
anesthesia. Decreased sensation starting at the mid thighs
progressing down to the feet. Unable to lift thighs bilaterally.
Unable to dorsiflex/plantarflex foot. Able to move toes
bilaterally. Absent patellar reflexes bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
OSH CT abdomen/pelvis [**2150-12-6**]: Findings raise concern for a mid
small bowel early or partial obstruction, exact site uncertain.
No specific signs of closed loop obstruction are identified. No
fre air. Distal esophageal changes, consistent with previous
clinical diagnosis of esophageal carcinoma. Post right
nephrectomy. Gallstones. Pleural effusions.
.
OSH CT head [**2150-12-7**]: There is a 1cm enhancing mass at the
grey-white matter junction of the posterior left frontal lobe,
with some associated edema but no significant mass effect. Given
history, likely metastasis.
.
OSH CT thoracic spine [**2150-12-9**]: severe compression of the T6
vertebral body, resulting in a kyphotic angulation of the spine
at this level. There is significant retropulsion of bone
fragments into the spinal canal at this level which reduces the
diameter of the spinal canal by approximately 50%. Although soft
tissue resolution in the spinal canal is limited, suspect that
soft tissue material is suspicious for tumor extending from the
compressed vertebra into the spinal canal. Moderate sized
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
OSH CT lumbar spine [**2150-12-9**]: Moderate compression of L2, L4,
L5, appearance of osteoporotic compression fractures. Moderate
acquired spinal stenosis at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels.
.
[**2150-12-10**] T & L spine MRI: IMPRESSION:
1. T6: Severe compression fracture, with areas of increased
signal intensity on the STIR sequence, likely related to edema.
Retropulsion of the posterior aspect of the vertebral body into
the spinal canal resulting in severe spinal canal stenosis and
moderate degree of compression on the spinal cord at this level.
Pre- and paravertebral and epidural component noted. Pathologic
compression fracture likely, with involvement by tumor. However,
assessment can be better performed with post-contrast images.
2. L2: Moderate degree of loss of height of the L2 with areas of
marrow
edema. Pathologic compression fracture cannot be completely
excluded.
Possible prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Post-contrast images
can be
helpful to assess for tumor at this level. Correlation with bone
sca/PET can be considered to assess for neoplastic
etiology.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes, multifactorial in the lumbar
spine with moderate-to-severe canal stenosis at L4-5 level,
crowding of the roots of the cauda equina. Edema in the cord in
the thoracic spine from T4-T8 levels.  Increased signal
intensity in the posterior spinous soft tissues in the mid
thoracic spine, question trauma/dependent edema. To correlate
clinically. Bilateral pleural effusions, left more than right.
Please see other details in the CT chest report.
.
[**2150-12-10**] Chest CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. 2. Moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, increased from the comparison
study. 3. Collapse of the T6 vertebral body with resultant
severe narrowing of the central spinal canal. 4. Thickening of
esophagus and para-esophageal lymphadenopathy concordant with
history of esophageal cancer.
.
[**2150-12-11**] Brain MRI: IMPRESSION:
1. Mass with intrinsic susceptibility artifact within the left
insular
subcortical white matter with adjacent edema. This could
represent an aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, as an M2 branch extends
into it. However, a hemorrhagic metastasis (especially given
history of renal cell carcinoma) is also possible, as is a small
parenchymal hgematoma. Comparison with prior images,
particularly the CTA from [**Hospital1 2025**] referred to in Dr.[**Name (NI) 87744**] note,
would be helpful. 2. Moderate to severe intracranial
atherosclerosis.
.
[**2150-12-11**] C Spine MRI IMPRESSION:
No evidence of cervical metastases on this examination on this
limited, incompete examinatio
