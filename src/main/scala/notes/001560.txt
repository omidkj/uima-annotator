Images:
[**2165-8-9**] CXR: Mild interstitial edema and cardiomegaly.
[**2165-8-9**] CT HEAD: No acute intracranial process.
[**2165-8-10**] LLE DOPPLER:No left lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.
[**2165-8-12**] CALF MRI:1. No signs of muscle edema or myonecrosis in
the left calf.2. Subcutaneous soft tissue edema of the left calf
may reflect third spacing of fluid and edematous changes or
cellulitis in the proper clinical setting. 3. Probable small
bone infarcts involving the posterolateral distal tibia and
lateral aspect of the talus correlated with [**2165-8-9**] left
ankle radiographs 4. Mild thickening of the Achilles tendon at
attachment site with associated enthesopathy at the posterior
calcaneus.
[**2165-8-15**] CTA CHEST: No evidence of PE. Moderate cardiomegaly with
moderate coronary calcifications. Small hiatal hernia. No
evidence of aortic pathology.
[**2165-8-16**] MRI HEAD NON CON:1. No evidence of acute infarct,
intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesion. 2. Changes of chronic
small vessel ischemic disease. 3. Generalized cerebral atrophy.
4. Focus of old hemorrhage in right frontal lobe which is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo F with PMH schizoaffective disorder, CAD, HTN, DM,
restrictive lung disease, discoid lupus, and h/o CVA, who p/w 3d
h/o audio and visual hallucinations, leg pain, and SOB with
altered mental status.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

#Alered Mental Status/Hallucinations: Given pt's history of
schizoaffective disorder and vascular dementia, initial
presentation was thought to be related to delirium vs.
progressive dementia or primary psychiatric condition. Initial
work-up for infectious and neurologic causes of delirium were
unrevealing. Urine analysis was unremarkable, chest xray showed
no infiltrate, blood cultures showed no growth. A head CT was
negative for an acute intracranial process. A head MRI was also
obtained to further evaluate for neurologic causes,and showed
only chronic changes and no new areas of ischemia.  An EEG was
obtained and was negative for epileptifor
