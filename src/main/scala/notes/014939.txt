History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year-old woman with a history of diastolic
CHF who was initially admitted with dizziness and shortness of
breath.  Patient states that she was in her normal state of
health until early yesterday morning when she woke up to use the
bathroom.  She felt like she was "teetering on water" when
sitting on the side of her bed and putting her socks on.  She
tried to walk to the bathroom but needed to sit down in a chair
so she would not fall. She called her lifeline and they
responded and transported her to the ED.  The patient was + for
nausea.  She denied CP and SOB.
.
She does admit to orthopnea (sleeps on two pillows) but not PND.
 +LE edema.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T: 98.4, BP 158/63, P 56, R 18,
O2 97% on 4 L (89% on RA), and she was nauseated. Her ECG showed
STE in V1 and ST depressions in V4-V6.  She was given ASA and
Zofran and was started on a nitro gtt and heparin gtt. She had a
CXR which demonstrated instersitial edema and had a BNP of 1000.
She was then admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3, where she was felt to be fluid
overloaded and she was with furosemide 20mg PO x 1 and had
2725ml of urine output.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, vomiting, diarrhea,
palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, urinary
frequency, urgency, dysuria, focal weakness, vision changes,
headache, rash or skin changes. Patient endorses constipation,
which is unchanged from prior.

Past Medical History:
-Head injury s/p fall ([**2121**]), was in coma, cerebral hemorrhage
and temporary shunt/R frontal craniotomy at that time, seizure
disorder since - usual seizures are "few minutes of L face
tightening" with immediate return to baseline; occur 1-2x/yr
-CLBP related to lumbar stenosis and degenerative disease,
associated polyradiculopathy by MRI [**4-17**]
-"Possible cervical stenosis" per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12528**]/neurology [**9-17**]

Echo from [**2138-8-26**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF ~35-40 %) with inferolateral hypokinesis; views
are technically suboptimal for assessment of regional wall
motion. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Echo repeated post pacemaker from [**2138-8-29**]: showed no pericardial
effusion
.
CXR [**2138-8-26**]:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged mild interstitial prominence, most
consistent with
fluid overload.
.
CXR [**2138-8-29**]:
IMPRESSION: Left-sided dual lead pacer with leads in
satisfactory position. Severe scoliosis with leftward deviation
of the mediastinum. No pneumothorax.
.
ECG on [**8-26**]:
Sinus bradycardia with Left bundle branch block
.
ECG on [**8-28**]:
Sinus bradycardia with sinus arrest and pauses of approximately
1.5 to 2.0 seconds. Left bundle-branch block and diffuse T wave
inversions
and repolarization abnormalities persist. Compared with prior
tracing of [**2138-8-27**] multiple abnormalities persist. However,
sinus pauses are new.
.
ECG on [**8-30**]:
Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction delay of the left
bundle-branch block type. Since the previous tracing of [**2138-8-29**]
the rhythm is now sinus and ST-T wave abnormalities are more
marked.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old female with h/o CHF who initially presented with
presyncope and was found to be volume overloaded.  Transferred
to the CCU for bradycardia with multiple asymptomatic long
pauses on telemetry while sleeping, now s/p pacemaker placement,
now s/p severe drug reaction.
.
# Bradycardia:
The pt was transferred to the CCU for sinus bradycardia of
30s-40s with junctional escape beats.  Pt has had multiple
episodes of bradycardia associated with decreased blood
pressure.  Her HR decreased to 20s with SBP of 80s while
sleeping but would icrease to HR 50s and BP 120s when awakened.
She did not experience any symptoms during her episodes, though
it is possible that her bradycardia contributed to the
presyncopal episode for which she originally presented. On the
night prior to pacemaker placement the patient had several
prolonged pauses of 9 seconds associated with transiently
diminished blood pressure.  The patient was sleeping comfortably
during these pauses. The patient was monitored on telemetry and
did not experience any complication
