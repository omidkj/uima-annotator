History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo Cantonese-speaking man w/hx of stage IV NSCLC
dx [**12-29**] who presented to the ED with acute onset SOB yesterday
with exertion.  He was found to have right mainste PE with
extension into apical RUL, RML, and RLL segemnt.  A head CT was
performed which showed stable brain mets.  He was started on
heparin.  On the OMED service, he was transitioned to lovenox.
On admission, his HR was 110s-120s in sinus.
.
Patient triggered on the floor for tachycardia to 150s at 9 PM
on the evening of his admission with a stable blood pressure.
He also had an increasing oxgyen requiring ment from 91% on RA
on admission to 92% on 4LNC and ultimately to a NRB.  His HR
remained stable between 92 - 146/69-103.  He given 1L NS and his
respiratory status worsened.  He was tachypneic to the 30s and
unable to speak in full sentences.  He denies chest pain, chest
pressure, fevers, chills, cough.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History (per medical record):
- presented [**2179-12-21**] with SOB and was found to have stage IV
lung cancer with mets to the spine, sternum, ribs and basal
ganglia, with pathologic fractures of T2 and T5 and malignant
effusion on teh left. The primary lesion is in the left lung
apex with invasion into the anterior chest wall.
- thoracentesis [**2179-12-22**] showed adenocarcinoma with CK7 and TTF-1
positive, consistent with NSCLC. Bronchial biopsy [**2179-12-23**]
confirmed this diagnosis. EGFR testing reported L858R mutation
in exon 21 on [**1-20**] by [**Company 2475**].

CXR.  [**2180-1-28**].
interval development of pulmonary edema with increased left
pleural effusion.

Lower extremity ultrasound [**2180-1-28**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities.

CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung
diffusely,
particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and
mid lung
zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of
alveolar and
interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion
that appears
similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
substantially
since the prior study and there is no PTX.
IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia,
CHF or ARDS should be considered.

CXR [**2180-2-1**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], the monitoring
and support
devices remain in place. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
opacifications have
somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones. These are
superimposed
upon known pulmonary metastases.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC admitted with large
right mainstem bronchus PE complicated by new onset atrial
fibrillation with RVR and respiratory distress.

1.  Respiratory Distress/ARDS.  Patient is known to have large
PE and was anticoagulated with lovenox.  On arrival to the ICU,
patient was in A. fib with RVR to 150s. CXR demonstrated
pulmonary edema likely secondary to fluids and rapid ventricular
rate.  ABG demonstrated respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia with
PAO2 of 93 on NRB. Additionally, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted on chest CT
to have worsening interstitial disease secondary to malignancy
progression. He was initially diuresed with lasix, rate
controlled with diltiazem and treated with BiPAP, his status
worsened and he required intubation. Subsequent CXRs were
consistent with ARDS.  Ventilator setting were titrated to
ARDSnet protocol low tidal volume ventilation.  He had
significant dyssynchrony, and was subsequently paralyzed.  His
hypoxia and acidemia gradually improved.

2. Tachycardia.  The patient initially in atrial fibrillation
with RVR and was started on a diltiazem drip with resolution of
his RVR.  It was thought that his new onset atrial fibrillation
was likely secondary to respiratory distress from known
pulmonary processes. He was switched to po digoxin and converted
to sinus rhythm.  As his respiratory status deteriorated, he
intermittently converted back to atrial fibrillation with rates
in the 150s.  This improved once he was mechanically ventilated

3.  Pulmonary Embolism.  Patient presented with large right
pulmonary artery PE. He was started on anticoagulation with
enoxaparin.  Bilateral LE ultrasounds were performed, to see if
patient warranted consideration of IVC filter placement, but
were negative for DVT. An TTE was done on [**2180-1-28*
