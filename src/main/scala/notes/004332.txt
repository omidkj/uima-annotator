PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VS: 98.2 150/75 87 22 93/3l
GEN: NAD, awake, alert
HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, sclera anicteric, conjunctivae clear, OP
moist and without lesion
NECK: Supple, no JVD
CV: Reg rate, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g.
CHEST: b/l wheezes and rhonchi.
ABD: Soft, NT, ND, no HSM
EXT: No c/c/e
SKIN: maculopapular rash on back


Pertinent Results:
CXR: IMPRESSION: Study limited due to low inspiration. Bibasilar
likely
atelectasis although underlying aspiration or pneumonia cannot
be excluded. There may be a small left pleural effusion.

Head CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage seen. Appearance
of the brain is unchanged from [**2199-6-18**]. Opacification of
visualized right maxillary sinus unchanged.

Abdominal U/S: GRAYSCALE IMAGING: The liver demonstrates a
heterogeneous echotexture without focal mass lesion detected on
this limited evaluation of the hepatic parenchyma. No intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation with the common duct
measuring 3 mm. The gallbladder appears unremarkable, without
wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid/intraluminal stone.
There is splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 17.6 cm. No
intra-abdominal ascites. DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color and pulsed
pulse-wave Doppler images were obtained. The main portal vein is
patent with normal hepatopetal flow with a velocity of 22
cm/sec. The TIPS shunt is patent with wall-to-wall flow.
Velocities of 27, 90 and 94 cm/sec. The splenic vein and SMV are
patent. IVC demonstrates patency with triphasic waveforms.
IMPRESSION: Normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall flow. No
ascites identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure:  The patient developed respiratory
failure during seziure activity and recent HCAP.  He was
intubated for airway protection and sent to the MICU.  He was
able to be extubated days later without difficulty.  The patient
was treated with lasix for diuresis.  Sputum cultures were
positive for klebsiella, proteus, sensitive to meropenem, zosyn
and tobra however most likely contaminent not infection, and the
patient was not started on antibiotics as the patient had
received vanc/ceftriaxone/flagyl eariler in his hospital course.
 He was evaluated by pulmonary who felt his tachypnea was likely
due to fluid overload. He was diuresed and his respiratory
status later stabilized. No further bronchoscopy was recommended
as it was unlikely that he laryngeal/tracheal stenosis given his
clinical improvement with diuresis.
.
#Seizure disorder:  The patient has a known seizure disorder and
hx of NCSE.  He again had continuous seizure activity documented
by continous EEG monitoring.  His home regimen of keppra,
zonegran and topamax was increased and ativan, dilantin were
added to the regimen. He required dilantin loading on two
occassions. His seizures were eventually well controlled and the
ativan was weaned off without seizure recurrence under EEG
monitoring. His mental status started to improve signficantly
and at discharge, he was answering questions briskly, able to
state the place but did not know the date, and was eager to
leave the hospital.
.
# Cirrhosis: Secondary to NASH.  During his hospital stay his
LFTs/bili and coags remained stable.  He underwent an abdominal
U/S of liver w/ normal TIPS evaluation with wall-to-wall flow.
No ascites identified.  He was continued on lactulose and
rifaxamin.
.
#. Stage IV sacral decub:  No evidence of osteomyelitis per
X-ray.  Wound care consulted and recommended daily packing.
.
#DM: The patient was temporarily taken off home lantus as had
episodes of hypoglycemia.  He was restarted on his home dose of
lantus without problem.
.
#Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine
.
# Hypernatremia:  The patient became transiently hypernatremic
during his MICU course.  Free water boluses were increased
through his tube feeds.  The hypernatremia resolved.
.
# CAD: stress MIBI in [**3-25**] w/ Fixed, medium sized, severe
perfusion defect involving the PDA territory.  Increased left
ventricular cavity size. Inferior hypokinesis with preserved
systolic function.  No recent h/o chest pain.  Most recent echo
with improved EF.
.
# Pancytopenia:  Chronic issue, likely BM suppression or
secondary to seizure medications.  Trended, remained stable.
.
#FEN:  tube feeds, repleted electrolytes prn, free H20 boluses
through tube feeds.
#PPX: PPI, lactulose, pneumoboots (no heparin sq given low
platelets), aspiration precautions, contact [**Name (NI) 70584**]
