Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 24642**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for surgical management. He continued to have chest pain
post-cath despite receiving Nitroglycerin and Morphine. Because
of this and due to the severity of his coronary disease he was
brought emergently to the operating room. He underwent a
coronary artery bypass x 5 and a ASD closure. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. During initial post-op
days he required a blood transfusion secondary to having a low
HCT and being hypotensive. He remained on Neo-Synephrine until
post-op day three when beta blockers and diuretics were started.
He was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day
three his chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the
telemetry floor. On post-op day four his epicardial pacing wires
were removed. During his post-op course he worked with PT for
strength and mobility. He continued to improve clinically and
was discharged home on post-op five with the appropriate meds
and follow-up appointments.
