ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory arrest

This is a 55-year-old male with a past medical history of
transverse myelitis, asthma who presented to the Emergency
Department for evaluation of muscle spasms and cough.  The
patient was in the usual state of health until the night
prior to admission after he, per his brother's report, had an
episode of choking and aspiration at the dinner table.  The
next morning, the morning of admission, the patient had cough
and increased muscle spasms, including his lower extremities
and chest, as well as increased difficulty breathing.  This
prompted the patient's family to take him to the Emergency
Department, where he was found to have extra two fentanyl
patches.  Per his wife's report, the patient is taking two
100 mg fentanyl patches, however on the morning of admission,
he forgot to remove two and so he had four patches at the
time of admission to the Emergency Department.

The patient was evaluated by Emergency Department personnel
and it was felt that he was oversedated from narcotics and
therefore the patient was given Narcan which lead to
increased agitation and difficulty to control the patient in
the department.  In order to sedate him, he was given Ativan
and morphine.  Lopressor was given as well, however his blood
pressure continued to fall.  The patient became non
responsive and was intubated and transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

Chest x-ray on admission was consistent with right lower lobe
pneumonia and Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] was started on clindamycin and
ceftriaxone for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  In the unit,
the patient continued to improve and was extubated on [**6-10**] and transferred to the floor on [**6-12**].  His asthma
was treated with nebulizers, albuterol and Atrovent.  He was
receiving Neurontin, Baclofen for transverse myelitis.  His
blood pressures were within normal range.  On [**6-13**], the
patient's sputum cultures came back positive for pseudomonas
and his antibiotics were changed from ceftriaxone to Zosyn.
On [**6-14**], the patient developed difficulty breathing.  At
midnight, he was saturating 93% on 100% nonrebreather mask
with respiratory rate of 40.  He became visibly tachypneic,
anxious.  His arterial blood gas was obtained and was
significant for PCO2 38, PO2 56, pH 7.50 and the patient was
transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he was not intubated, but
was started on CPAP which adequately maintained oxygen
saturations above 92%.  His treatment for pseudomonas
pneumonia was double coverage with ceftazidime in addition to
Zosyn.  The patient continued to improve and was transferred
back to the floor on [**6-18**].  On the floor, he was seen by
psychiatry and his pain medication regimen was reevaluated.
Valium was taken off the regimen.  Instead, risperidone was
added and then gradually tapered down to 2 mg po q hs.

Pulmonary wise, Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] continued to improve on Zosyn and
ceftazidime, however on [**6-20**] he developed a rash which
was thought to be secondary to antibiotics.  His Zosyn was
stopped and he was started on Tobramycin.  He received
physical therapy and chest therapy, as well as nebulizer
therapy during his stay in the unit and on the floor.

His neurological and pain symptoms seemed to be well
controlled with risperidone, Paxil, diazepam and Demerol for
breakthrough pain.  He also received Baclofen for neurogenic
bladder and gabapentin for pain.

Hematologically, Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**]' hematocrit decreased down to
26.6.  The patient was offered a blood transfusion, however
Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] decided not to consent.  His hematocrit remained
low, but stable and went up to 33.1 prior to the discharge.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1683**] received daily doses of Coumadin because of the
history of deep venous thrombosis.  His INR upon transfer to
the floor was 5.20 and remained at this value for the next
few days.  He received 2.5 mg of vitamin K on [**6-20**] and
his INR went up to 1.1.  His Coumadin dose was increased to
5.0 prior to discharge.  He was also given subcutaneous
heparin 5000 units q 12 hours for adequate deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis.

Gastrointestinal - the patient continued on his bowel
regimen.  He received disimpactions as needed.  He had bowel
movements every one to two days.

to go home with services on the following medications:
