Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zocor / [**Year (4 digits) **] / Crestor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Bronchoscopy
2. Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
 69F PMH severe COPD (2L NC home O2, FEV1/FVC 55%, FEV1 30%
predicted, also restrictive defect with TLC 72% of predicted),
tracheobronchomalacia s/p stent placement [**2190-8-6**], initially
admitted to the IP service [**2190-9-3**] for acute shortness of
breath and increased cough thought secondary to mucus plugging.
Of note, the patient underwent bronchoscopy [**2190-8-13**] for mucus
plugging and recently finished a prednisone taper [**2190-8-23**] for
COPD exacerbation.  The patient underwent bronchoscopy [**2190-9-3**]
that showed that the stent itself appeared to be patent with
minimal secretions.  Granulation tissue was seen at the distal
end of the stent in both the right and the left main stem
bronchi.  The patient underwent stent removal [**2190-9-6**],
complicated by respiratory distress and hypercarbic respiratory
failure with pCO2 as high as 111.  The patient was intubated and
transferred to the SICU.  The patient was started on
levofloxacin 750 IV QD and methylprednisolone 80 mg IV Q8H
[**2190-9-7**] for empiric treatment of pneumonia and COPD flare.  The
patient was also diuresed with lasix presumably for volume
overload.  The patient was extubated [**2190-9-9**].  Patient required
BiPap until the morning of transfer.  At the time of transfer,
the patient was breathing comfortably on 6L NC.  Denies
shortness of breath, chest pain.
.
The patient's blood pressure was uncontrolled at times requiring
labetolol gtt, but the patient was on an oral regimen on
transfer

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-9-10**]
The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal
of the NG tube.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
Previously demonstrated patchy opacities did not change
significantly in the meantime interval.  [**Month (only) 116**] be atelectasis but
infection cannot be ruled out. Close followup is recommended to
exclude the possibility of developing pneumonia.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-9-7**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Decreased right lower lobe patchy opacities likely
reflecting resolving atelectasis and/or pneumonitis.
2.  OGT tip terminating within the gastric fundus with side port
likely at or above the GE junction.  [**Month (only) 116**] benefit from mild
advancement.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2190-9-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Endotracheal tube in satisfactory position.
2.  Bibasilar streaky opacities likely reflects underlying
atelectasis, difficult to exclude pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
IN THE MICU:
Assessment/Plan: 69F PMH severe COPD (FEV1/FVC 55%, FEV1
30%predicted, also restrictive defect with TLC 72% of
predicted), tracheobronchomalacia with recent stent removal
transferred from SICU for managment of presumptive COPD flare.
.
# Respiratory Distress.  Patient has history of severe COPD with
frequent exacerbations and this likely represents a COPD flare.
Patient has no history of CHF and does not appear fluid
overloaded.  Unlikely pulmonary embolus given prophylaxis.
Patient on 2L NC at baseline.
- Continue advair, tiotropium, standing albuterol, tessalon
perles, codeine PRN;
- Continue levofloxacin for presumptive pneumonia for 7-day
course started [**2190-9-7**] (course finished on [**2190-9-14**]); changed to
500 mg PO
- Slow steroid taper, taper methylprednisolone to prednisone 60
mg [**Last Name (LF) 244**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] decrease to 50 tomorrow and taper over 10-14d
- Consider TTE as outpatient to evaluate cardiac function
-BiPap machine attempted at night. not tolerated thought pt did
well on NC
-OOBed to chair
- wean NC from 6 to 2L as tolerated with goal sat low 90s (home
02 requirement 2Lpm)
.
#Agitation - currently resolved though pt jittery, likely froms
steroids
-Possibly from steroids, has had problems in past
-Discussed briefly with Son, functions well at baseline
-PRN haldol, small doses (.5mg w/ good result overnight)
-Will follow
.
# Leukocytosis.  Likely due to steroids versus pneumonia given
increased cough prior to admission.  The patient has remained
afebrile.  No other localizing signs or symptoms.
- Continue levofloxacin for CAP
- Blood cultures pending
-follow Diff
-UA negative for infection, cx + for coag _ staph, likely
contaminat. will hold on tx unless pt develops sx
.
# Hypernatremia.  Appears hypovolemic; patient given lasix
earlier in course.  Approximately 3.5L free water deficit.
Gentle IVF with 1/2 NS, Na improved this AM, now 144
-Will follow Na
.
# Acid-base status.  pH normal; likely respiratory acidosis of
COPD with metabolic alkalosis from volume depletion.
- Treatment as above
.
# Anemia.  Normocytic, stable from this admission, although
baseline appears mid-30s.  [**Month (only) 116**] be due to hypothyroidism.
- Guaiac all stools
- Iron studies, folate, B12
- TSH
.
# Hypertension.  Has required labetolol gtt during admission but
now improved control. on diltiazem 60 mg QID
- Consider amlodipine if hypertensive (patient allergic to
[**Last Name (LF) 26302**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] have bronchspasm with beta-blocker)
.
# Diabetes.  home metformin restarted.  Continue FSG and ISS.
.
# Hypothyroidism.  No active issues.  Continue current regimen.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia.  Continue current regimen.
