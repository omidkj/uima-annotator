Allergies:
Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5295**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, stents x 2 (left main, LAD)


History of Present Illness:
81yo M with DM, HTN, CAD with recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5979**] for CP and SOB.  At the time of this visit, he ruled out
by enzymes but was found on diagnostic cardiac catheterization
to have a 90% LAD; there was no therapeutic intervention at that
time.  He was subsequently referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11255**] who had
considered an outpatient intervention; however, Mr. [**Known lastname 68181**] had
instead opted to undergo an elective cardiac catheterization in
[**State 108**], where he could convalesce with his daughter.  In
preparation for the trip to [**State 108**], the patient awoke from
sleep on at 01:30 on [**2187-7-29**] with chest pain and shortness of
breath, which resolved with SL nitro x1.  He subsequently went
to [**Hospital3 **] where his first Trop-I was 0.27 and d-dimer
was negative (Cr 1.4).  Given his known cardiac disease he was
started on a hep gtt, integrillin gtt, and an NG patch was
administered.  In addition, the pt was given solumedrol and
ceftriaxone/azithromycin for presumed COPD/PNA.  Due to his
known LAD lesion, he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was afebrile with HR of 74, SBP of 97, but
was requiring NRB to maintain SaO2 in the mid 90s.  the pt had
one episode of chest pain which resolved with SL NTG x3.  He
reported SOB and DOE in associated with his CP but denied any
palpitations, PND, orthopnea, edema, presyncope or syncope.  He
was started on heparin gtt and integrillin gtt and admitted to
CCU.

.
CXR [**2187-7-29**]: "Heterogeneous opacification in the lower lungs,
right substantially greater than left could be due to pneumonia.
 Heart size is top normal.  Vascular deficiency in the upper
lungs suggests emphysema and rib deformities in the left chest
suggest previous thoracotomy."
.
ECG [**2187-7-29**]: NSR at 90, left axis, left anterior fascicular
block, TWI in L, occasional PVC.

[**2187-7-30**] TTE:
Conclusions:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.  There is regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include distal LV and apical hypokinesis.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD.

[**2187-7-31**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1. The proximal LMCA lesion was predilated with a 2.5 X 12mm
Maverick
balloon, stented with a 3.0 X 08mm Cypher stent and post dilated
with a
3.5 X 12mm Maverick and a 3.0 X 15mm NC Ranger balloon with
lesion
reduction from 80 to 10%.
2. The mid LAD lesion was predilated with a 3.0 X 20mm Maverick
balloon,
stented with a 3.0 X 28mm Cypher stent and post dilated with a
3.0 X
15mm NC Ranger balloon with lesion reduction from 99 % to 0%.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical LMCA lesion successfully treated with stenting (Drug

eluting)
2. Successful stenting of the LAD (Drug eluting)
.
CXR [**2187-8-3**] "Improvement of multifocal pneumonia. Stable
post-surgical changes and emphysema."


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 81yo M with known 90% LAD lesion, DM, and COPD p/w chest
pain and shortness of breath in setting of new PNA.
.
1.  CV:
A.  Coronaries: The pt presented with known h/o CAD.  He had
recently undergone a diagnostic catheterization which detected
90% LAD lesion.  Given the clinical presentation with symptoms
of chest pressure, SOB, and persistently elevated cardiac
enzymes, he underwent catherization with stent placement in two
vessels on [**2187-7-31**].  During his post-catheterization
convalescence integrilin and heparin drips were discontinued.
He was started on chronic anti-platelet therapy with ASA 325 mg
and Plavix 75mg.  In the peri-MI setting, his outpatient regimen
of Zocor 40 mg qday was changed to Lipitor 80 mg qday.  His
beta-blocker and ACEI were titrated to doses of Atenolol 75 mg
qday and Lisinopril 5 mg qday to achieve goals of heart rate<80
and BP <130/80.  In the peri-MI setting his outpatient
Felodipine was discontinued for improved mortality.
.
B.  Pump: Post-catherization TTE revealed diminshed EF of 45%
with distal LV and apical AK, nml valves.  In the setting of
heart failure, he was diuresed with furosemide 20mg PO daily and
was discharged home on this dose.
.
C.  Rhythm: The pt was maintained throughout his hospitalization
in NSR with consistent findings on exam and telemetry.
.
2.  PNA: The pt was found on admission to have heterogenous
opacifications in the lung bases, suggestive of an infiltrate.
This radiographic finding was further substantiated by his
elevated WBC and oxygen requirement.  Upon admission, he
received 3 days of ceftriaxone and azithromycin and then was
switched to levofloxacin 500 mg on day 4 of antibiotic therapy.
Mr. [**Known lastname 68181**] was discharged with RX for 7 additional days of
antibiotic therapy to complete 14-day course.  However, even
with radiographic improvement of the pneumonia, he continued to
require supplemental oxygen, both at rest and with activity,
likely secondary to underlying lung disease and a picture of
chronic hypoxia.  He had a persistent cough throughout
hospitalization and in the 48 hours prior to discharge had one
episode of coughing up a moderate amount of blood clots, and the
subsequently noted blood-tinged sputum.  No changes were noted
on chest x-ray at this time, and this was considered to be most
likely secondary to his acute cough and trauma to the
oropharynx. He remained hemodynamically stable, and was advised
to return to the ER in the case of gross hemoptysis or to
follow-up with his PCP in the case of persisting blood in his
sputum.
.
3.  COPD: No PFTs were available to us documenting the severity
of his likely chronic lung disease.  Given his h/o TB, s/p left
thoracotomy, and h/o tobacco abuse, he was treated as if a COPD
exacerbation were part of his clinical picture.  He was started
as an in-patient on a Prednisone taper and jet nebulizer
treatments with only mild improvement in his respiratory status.
 He was noted by PT to desat to 83-88% with ambulation on room
air, and he was recomm
