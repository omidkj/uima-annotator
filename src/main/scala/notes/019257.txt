History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 54 year old male with PMH of type II diabetes on
insulin(previous presentation for hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar
state), hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diastolic
congestive heart failure presenting with hyperglycemia in the
setting of not taking his insulin for 4 days.  Patient states
that he normally take 16 units insulin in the evening, but
forgot the last few days. He glucometer broke and he got a new
one that he did not know how to use. He says that over the last
few days he has felt weak with poor po intake. Also on day prior
to admission experienced abdominal pain and then n/v on morning
of presentation. Patient denies fevers, cough, chest pain.  He
does report some nausea. He denies dysuria but does report
urinary frequency and thirst. EMS initial blood sugar report was
>600.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.0 83 165/76 16 100%.
Glucose was noted to be >1000.  Patient was noted to be drowsy,
but arousable to voice.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.   His abdomen was tender diffusely.  Potassium was
4.4 with a creatinine of 5.9.  Anion gap was noted to be 20.
Chest X-ray was performed and showed no acute process.
Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection, and no ketones.  VBG
was performed and showed 7.35/48/58/28 with a lactate of 1.7.
Insulin 10 units IV were given and patient was started on an

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient is a 54yo male with
PMH of T2DM, CHF, and CKD5 who presents with hyperglycemic,
hyperosmolar state. He was admitted to the ICU on an insulin gtt
and had correction of blood sugar with resolution of elevated
anion gap overnight. He was transferred to the general medical
floor.
.
# Non-ketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state: Patient reports
not having taken his insulin in the past 4 days. He experienced
general malaise, abdominal pain, n/v and presented with blood
sugar in the low 1000's. On admission, he was placed on an
insulin drip and had blood sugars reduced to 100's overnight
following admission. He receieved IVF resuscitation and D5 as
FSBS fell. Lantus was overlapped with the drip and the drip was
discontinued. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 387**] consult was obtained and recommended that
his out pt insulin regimen be uptitrated to Glargine 30U at
night and an insulin sliding scale with humalog. His dinner time
sliding scale was made more aggressive due to his persistent
elevated glucose levels after dinner.
.
# Altered mental status: Patient's mental status on admission
was reported to be drousy but arousable, however upon reaching
the floor mental status was much improved. This is likely
explained by the non-ketotic hyperglycemic, hyperosmolar state,
but also would consider toxic metabolic encephalopathy from
infection given leukocytosis. His hyperglycemia was corrected
and mental status remained normal.

# Troponin elevation: Patient presented with ECG with TWI and
troponin to 0.04 in the setting of CKD-5. Previous labs have
shown troponin in the range of 0.03. Three sets of troponins
were obtained and each was 0.04. The pt was asymptomatic and
this was determined to not be ACS.
.
# Leukocytosis: Unclear etiology. Stress response vs. underlying
infection. CXR clear and rest of infectious workup including UA,
Blood and urine cultures were negative. The pt was afebrile
during this hospitalization. His WBC trended down without
treatment.
.
#T2DM: Patient has been non-adherent to insulin for four days
prior to admission. He has had [**Last Name (un) **] consult on previous
similar presentation. Will treat the hyperglycemia as above with
additional education and aid of the [**Hospital **] clinic.
.
#Acute on CKD5: CKD [**3-14**] DM and HTN. Patient has a bump in his
creatinine to 5.9 from last known baseline of around 5.0.
Pre-renal etiology is most likely considering his kidney
function improved with IVF administration. He was followed by
renal during this hospitalization who did not recommend any
changes to his current regimen. He had no acute indication for
dialysis.
.
#Hypertension:
- continued amlodipine
- continued metoprolol 200mg daily
- continued Lisinopril 20mg daily
.
#Chronic Diastolic CHF: The pt was not volume overloaded on exam
even after volume resuscitation due to hyperglycemia. We
continued his ACEi and Beta Blocker but initially held
diurectics as pt was severely dehydrated due to h
