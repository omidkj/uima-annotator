Admission Date:  [**2170-7-16**]     Discharge Date: [**2170-8-2**]


Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mental status change and bilateral upper
extremity swelling.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented on
[**7-16**] at [**Hospital6 2910**] with 24 hours
of worsening mental status changes and bilateral upper
extremity swelling.  Patient has a past medical history of
being a nursing home resident, dementia with behavioral
disturbance/depressed features, recent admission to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital with urosepsis of unknown etiology requiring
intubation, and discharged on [**2170-9-11**], diabetes
mellitus, coronary artery disease status post MI, CHF, COPD,
status post pacemaker placement, which required replacement
for low battery in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.

At the outside hospital, a chest CT with contrast was
performed, which showed obstruction of the superior vena cava
at the level of the origin of the SVC.  A head CT was also
done which was negative with no acute hemorrhage, an old left
frontal infarct, and thalamic calcifications and cortical
atrophy.

It was uncertain what the etiology of obstruction was and
ultimately the patient was started on Heparin drip and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation and possible intervention.  At the time of
the arrival of the patient to the Emergency Room, the patient
was slightly febrile at 101.4.  Had a blood pressure of
124/84.  Pulse of 105.  Breathing at 30 and sating 94% on
room air.  Vascular Surgery evaluated the patient and
recommended a venogram and a possible SVC stent at that time.
Patient was admitted for further workup.

ALLERGIES:  The patient reportedly had an allergy to
shellfish and IVP dye, however, at the outside hospital the
patient received contrast with a CT scan without any problems
as well as an inpatient.  Although of note, the IV dye used
was nonionic ............

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoker, unknown
alcohol use, and his surviving relatives is an elderly
sister, who knows him poorly.

PHYSICAL EXAM AT TIME OF ADMISSION:  Generally, patient in
some distress, was intermittently screaming at baseline.
Patient's vital signs were a temperature of 99.7, pulse of
105, blood pressure 130/86, respiratory rate 24, and
saturation 97% on 2 liters.

PERTINENT PHYSICAL FINDINGS:  The patient had great
significant periorbital edema or facial swelling.  The
patient did have 3+ bilateral pitting upper extremity edema
without lower extremity edema and had 2+ DP and PT pulses.
The patient's heart rate was tachycardic, but regular with a
normal S1, S2 with no murmurs.  Lungs:  Patient was making
poor effort with bibasilar crackles.  Chest had numerous
dilated and tortuous superficial veins that were apparent.
The abdomen was benign.

LABORATORY STUDIES BEFORE THE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED:  At the
outside hospital, the patient had a CBC which had a white
count of 3.7, hematocrit 32.6, and platelets of 214.
Coagulation showed a PT of 13.8, PTT of 33.4, and an INR of
1.2 previous to starting Heparin.  Chem-7 was significant for
a potassium of 3.5, creatinine of 0.9, and bicarb of 33.
LFTs were significant for an ALT of 31, AST of 27, alkaline
phosphatase of 606, and total bilirubin of 1.64, direct
bilirubin of 1.1, and an albumin of 2.8.  Patient's CK and
troponin-I were both negative.

Additional laboratory studies on arrival in the Emergency
Room showed a lactate of 1.8.  A differential on his white
count with 83% polys.  A urinalysis showed a large amount of
blood with trace leukocyte esterase, 150 ketones, but was
otherwise negative.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 107 with left
axis deviation and new poor R-wave progression in leads V2
through V5 with T waves consistent with normal EKG.  The
calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were 9.7, 2.0, and 3.3
respectively.  Uric acid and iron studies were normal.
Cholesterol study was normal.  TSH was 1.5.  A LP was
performed due to the patient's mental status change which had
175 reds, 1 white cell with a differential of 73% polys, 27%
lymphocytes, total protein was 22, and glucose was 125, Gram
stain was negative, and subsequent LP culture never grew out
any organisms.

Chest x-ray at the time of admission showed no effusion or
infiltrate, but did have a tortuous aorta.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  This is up to date to the
evening of [**8-2**].  Future dictation is to be
addended.

1. SVC syndrome:  Patient had notable SVC syndrome on chest
CT at outside hospital and the chest CT was repeated while
the patient was in-house on [**7-18**], which was
performed with contrast and showed occlusion of the SVC
without obvious evidence of clot or external compression, and
also of note, on the chest, the lungs were clear and the
abdomen had no significant pathology.

On the evening of [**7-19**], the patient was taken for a
SVC graft and attempted wire transversal of the occlusion
with theoretical stent placement.  However, the SVC was found
to be totally occluded above the level of the azygos and
subsequently wires cannot be passed either above or below.
The occlusion cannot be opened.  At that time, the
recommendation was made for sharp recanalization potentially
some time in the future.  However, at that time the patient's
guardianship status arrived, and it was not until the
patient's guardian was appointed and a discussion was
arranged between patient's guardian and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] of
Interventional Radiology.  We were able to reconsider the
sharp Recanalization.

On [**7-24**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] visited the patient and found the
patient to be somewhat hesitant to have the procedure done,
although his mental status was not completely clear.
Consequently, we arranged for a family meeting on [**7-26**] with the guardian and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**].  At this time, it was
decided with the patient's seeming approval, the procedure
should go ahead on [**7-31**] with sharp recanalization.

However, over the following several days the patient became
increasingly clear of mental function and on about [**7-29**], patient's expressed to the attending, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
that he did not want to have the procedure done.

Consequently, on the 15th, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**] and legal guardian were
[**Name (NI) 653**], and it was felt that the procedure should not be
performed.  Specifically, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] talked with the
guardian, and decided that procedure would be of no
significant benefit to the patient at this time, and could be
deferred until future.  Specific argument was that a cerebral
blood flow study was performed which showed no significant
venous stasis, and thus, it was unclear whether or not the
patient's mental function would improve after the procedure,
and the patie
