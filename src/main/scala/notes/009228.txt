ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aortic stenosis.
2.  Coronary artery disease.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aortic stenosis.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Death.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
gentleman who was found to have critical aortic stenosis as
well as coronary artery disease.  He presented for aortic
valve repair as well as coronary artery bypass grafting.

The patient had complained of dyspnea on exertion over the
past several months eventually progressing to shortness of
breath after only 20 feet to 30 feet of ambulation.  The
patient had an echocardiogram demonstrating an aortic valve
area of 0.7 cm2 with an ejection fraction of 55%.  Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated 1-vessel coronary artery
disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  History of abdominal aortic aneurysm; status post
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
5.  Permanent cardiac pacemaker.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (Medications at home included)
1.  Glyburide 5 mg by mouth in the morning and 2.5 mg by
mouth in the evening.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Diovan/hydrochlorothiazide 160/1.5 mg by mouth in the
morning.
4.  Coumadin 2 mg by mouth once per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General physical
examination on admission revealed the patient was in no acute
distress.  A thin white male.  The chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a systolic ejection
murmur.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
No masses or organomegaly.  The extremities were warm and
well perfused with trace peripheral edema.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**12-18**], the
patient was brought to the operating room and had an aortic
valve replacement done with #23 [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tissue
valve.  He concomitantly had a coronary artery bypass graft
with a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal artery.
For details of the operation, please see the previously
dictated Operative Report.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recover Unit on a Neo-Synephrine drip
for blood pressure control.  The patient was transfused
appropriately.  The patient was extubated on postoperative
day one.

Over the next few days, the patient exercised increasing
respiratory distress despite diuresis with Lasix.  The
patient was reintubated on the morning on postoperative day
three.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which
showed unchanged aortic valve function from preoperatively.
A chest x-ray and computed tomography scan seemed to
demonstrate an acute respiratory distress syndrome picture.

The patient was sedated and paralyzed and on a prolonged
ventilatory wean.  The patient also began to have multiple
arrhythmia issues beginning on postoperative day five.  He
was treated with beta blockade as well as an amiodarone drip.
The patient also did begin to develop some element of renal
failure.

Over the next two weeks, the patient slowly weaned from the
ventilator as well as maintained on multiple different
pressors for blood pressure and arrhythmia.

Ultimately, the patient was extubated on [**2140-1-4**].  He
was reintubated on [**2140-1-7**] for respiratory distress.
A repeat computed tomography scan on [**2140-1-8**]
demonstrated acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as
bilateral pneumonia.  A sputum culture confirmed
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  A
tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy were performed at
the bedside on [**2140-1-12**].  A transesophageal
echocardiogram on [**2140-1-13**] demonstrated a large fluid
collection by the right atrium by the right atrium.

On [**2140-1-14**] the patient was taken back to the
operating room for re-exploration.  A mini right anterior
thoracotomy was performed, and the pericardial window and
drain of pericardial effusion were performed.  For details of
this operation, please see the previously dictated Operative
Report.  This was performed by thoracic surgeon Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**].

On [**2140-1-15**] continuous venovenous hemofiltration was
begun by the Nephrology Service for the patient's ongoing and
worsening renal failure.  The patient continued to have
multiple arrhythmias over the next several days.   The
patient was noted to have a worsening metabolic acidosis with
a high lactate level.  The patient's liver enzymes bumped and
was thought to be secondary to cardiogenic shock and
hypoperfusion of the liver.

The patient had worsened hemodynamics.  A bronchoscopy with
bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on [**2140-1-23**].
This demonstrated yeast of three different types.  The
patient was placed on fluconazole as well as empiric
antibiotics.

Over the next two weeks, the patient's hemodynamics worsened.
On [**2140-1-31**], the patient was two blood cultures
positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis.  The patient's
macrobacterial coverage broadened to include AmBisome.

On [**2140-2-3**], the patient had a bronchoscopy performed
with two different bronchoalveolar lavages.  These were
positive for yeast as well as methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Also on this date, the patient grew
out [**3-2**] blood culture bottles for methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient had worsening sepsis with
increasing metabolic acidosis over the next few days.  He was
on multiple pressors for hemodynamic support.  He also
continued to have multiple hemodynamically significant
arrhythmias which required electrical cardioversion.

On [**2140-2-6**], after a long discussion between the
family and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] (the attending physician)
the patient was made do not resuscitate/do not intubate
status and pressors were withdrawn.  The patient expired
within 10 minutes after support was withdrawn.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
 1.  Aortic stenosis.

 6.  Renal failure.
 7.  Liver failure.
 8.  Fungemia.
 9.  Bacteremia.
10.  Sepsis.
11.  Asystole.
