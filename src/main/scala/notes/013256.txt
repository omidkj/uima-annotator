Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
hip fracture s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left hip hemiarthroplasty


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 406**] is a 82M with a history of atrial fibrillation
on coumadin, EtOH Cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension,
TIAs and s/p TKA of LLE, septic arthritis s/p washout [**2-29**],
discharged to rehab on [**2196-3-18**], presents back to the hospital s/p
fall with new left hip fracture.
.
Per patient, he received sleeping pill last night for insomnia
(rehab facility confirmed trazadone 25mg), felt groggy this
morning, got up to go to the bureau, slipped and fell landing on
his side.  He experienced severe pain in his groin and was
unable to get up from the floor.  Rehab staff found him on the
floor.  He was responsive, and there was no evidence of seizure,
no notable weakness, and no urinary or fecal incontinence.
Patient denies hitting his head, and there was no evidence of
trauma. He denies chest pain, palpitations, dizziness,
lightheadedness. Patient was taken to the hospital.
.
Of note, patient was noted to syncopize while working with
physical therapy the day prior to presentation.  He was noted to
be conversant while eating lunch.  Immediately thereafter, he
was walking with PT and just feel over and became unresponsive.
A Code Blue was called, but prior to resuscitation, staff hit
him hard on the chest, and patient "woke up," asking why he was
being hit.  Per nursing home staff, patient endorsed a prior
episode similar to this at home several months ago, but patient
was unable to confirm this today.
.
Patient is at rehab recovering from left knee washout, culture
grew staph lugdunensis, and he was on vancomycin, as nafcillin
was implicated in AIN.  He is followed in OPAT and his abx
should finish [**2196-4-12**].  Last dose of vancomycin was on [**3-29**], when
he received 750mg q2d.  AT rehab, nurses noted that he was
recovering well, regaining range of motion in his knee and
regaining strength, able to walk around the floor.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.5 119 145/110 22 98%.  EKG
showed  a. fib at 99, NA, TWI laterally.  Lab work revealed INR
6.4, Cr 1.7 (baseline), Hct 35 (higher than baseline at recent
discharge).  Head CT was negative for bleed.  Patient was given
morphine 5mg x2 for pain.  Hip films showed nondisplaced
impaction fracture of the left femoral neck.  Patient was seen
by ortho team, who recommended surgical fixation after medical
stabilization.  Patient was transferred to the medical floor.
Vitals prior to transfer were: 96.8 ax HR: 99-107 a. fib. RR: 11
O2: 100 BP: 165/98 Pain: 0/10.
.
On the floor, VS: 97.2  149/97  112  20  98(RA).  Patient was
very somnolent, but was arousable and can answer questions,
although responses were slow and patient endorses significant
gaps in his memory.  Daughter states that this is his usual
state when he receives pain medication.  He denies pain or
discomfort.

Imaging:
TTE [**2195-11-25**]:
The left atrial volume is severely increased. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. Doppler parameters are
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction. Mild mitral
regurgitation, likely due to leaflet tethering. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Biatrial enlargement.

Cardiac Cath [**2195-10-15**]:
1) Selective angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated
non-obstructive coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was normal.
The LAD had minor lumen irregularities in the mid and distal
portions of the vessel; the proximal diagonal branch had 40-50%
stenosis.  The LCx had minor irregularities.  The RCA had 30-40%
stenosis at the distal posterolateral segment artery.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate-to-severe
systemic
arterial hypertension, with a central aortic pressure of 161/97
mmHg.

pMIBI [**2195-9-2**] ([**Hospital1 **]):  No evidence of infarct or ischemia;
normal wall motion; calculated EF 53%; TID 0.97.

CT Head [**2196-3-30**]:
IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial process. Age-related involutional changes.
