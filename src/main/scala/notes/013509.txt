Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 14218**] was admitted on [**2187-10-11**].  She underwent a CABG x
3 with LIMA to the LAD, SVG to the RCA, and SVG to the OM and a
mitral valve replacemnet with a 25mm C-E porcine valve.  Total
cardio-puolmonary bypass time was 150 minutes and her total
cross-clamp time was 118 minutes.  She was transferred to the
CSRU A-paced at a rate of 88 with a MAP of 70 and a CVP of 13.
She was on milrinone, epinephrine, levophed, and propofol drips.
She had some trouble weaning from the ventilator immediately
postoperatively.  She was followed closely by the respiratory
therapy team and was extubated without incident on
post-operative day two.
Her hemodynamics were labile in her postoperative course
requiring continuous pacing (for a couple [**Last Name (un) 32460**] only) and IV drip
medications including nitroglycerine, neosynephrine, nipride,
and levophed to keep systolic blood pressure stable.  Her
underlying rhythm was a SR with first degree AV-block.  By
post-operative day three she was sustained on PO blood pressure
medications with a nitroglycerine drip.  Her heart rhythm
continued as a first degree block with multiple bursts of atrial
fibrillation continuing until post-operative day 12 -- these
bursts were rate controlled with IV lopressor.  She was put on
coumadin for these continued bursts of atrial fibrillation.
On postoperative six she had an acute desaturation thought to be
related to a possible aspiration event.  She was treated with
nebulized albuterol and NT suctioning. CXR at this time showed a
right lower lobe opacity.  A nutrition consult was obtained
because of the thoughts of possible aspiration and they
recommended regular diet/regular consistency as patient had no
signs/symptoms of aspiration.  Zosyn was started empiracally.
White blood cell count was elevated with a max of 29.3 on [**10-22**].
Sputum culture from [**10-23**] grew sensitive Staph aureus.  An
infectious disease consult was obtained on [**10-22**] with initial
recs for continued Zosyn with flagyl.  A workup of the possible
sources of infection was undertaken with final diagnosis being
probable aspiration pneumonia with possible early C. diff
infection.  Final recommendations on [**10-25**] were for continuation
of flagyl with addition of levoquin for a total of 14 days.
White blood cell count on [**10-26**] was 12.7 and trending downwards.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 14218**] also experienced a significant degree of
post-operative confusion and anxiety for which the neurology
service was consulted on post-operative day two.  Her initial
head CT was negative for any acute infarct and reason for
confusion was thought to be sedative medications.  With
discontinuation of these culpret medications, the initial
confusion cleared and she is now (at time of discharge) alert
and oriented.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 14218**] was transferred to the inpatinet floor on POD 7.
The physical therpy team initially evaluated Mrs. [**Known lastname 14218**] on
[**2187-10-13**] in the intensive care unit and followed her throughout
her hospital stay.  On [**10-26**] they found her to have improved
mobility though she did not meet all of their goals and they
recommended continued physical therapy.
