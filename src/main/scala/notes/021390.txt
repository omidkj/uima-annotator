Allergies:
Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with POBA(PCA without stenting) of
Prox/mid LAD


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 62 year old man with history of CAD status post
MI in 99 with LAD disease and stenting who presented with chest
pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after found to have anterior
ST elevation. Patient is a poor historian and history is
obtained from records.

He first noted chest pain this afternoon at around 1400. He has
a history of seizure disorder and initially thought he was
having a seizure but later developed chest pain promting him to
the [**Hospital3 3383**] ED.

He describes the pain as left sided chest pain, [**10-24**] in
severity, radiating to arm. This was associated with nausea and
vomiting. He denies any lightheadedness, palpitations or SOB. He
also discoses involuntary muscle movements in left upper
extermity prior to chest pain. He could not describe whether
this was typical of his seizure disorder.

He was found to have anterior ST elevations with reportedly
elevated CE and was given aspirin, clopidrogel, heparin ggt and
eptifibatide. He was taken to cath lab where he was found to
have diffuse LAD disease. This was ballooned and the patient is
transfered to the CCU post procedure. He currently still has
chest pain that is [**5-24**] in severity.

Of note he has had a history of similar chest pain throughout
the years since his MI in 99. In 03 he had a nuclear stress test
that is reported as negative for ischemic changes. In [**9-23**] he
had a TTE with preserved EF and no WMA.

On review of systems, s/he denies any dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope, prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.


Past Medical History:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
with
severe stenosis in his apical LAD as well as occluded obtuse
marginal. S/P LAD stent in 99.
2.  History of seizure disorder, on medications.  Last seizure
was four weeks back.
3.  History of psoriasis.
4.  History of glaucoma.
5.  History of chronic sinusitis.
6.  History of nephrotic syndrome with baseline [**Date Range **] 1.0.



Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] lives alone and gets occasional help from his nieces
and nephews. [**Name (NI) **] used to smoke pipe for about 50 years, but quit
two years back.  He quit alcohol about 11 years back. There is
no history of illicit drug use.  He is retired for about eight
years and worked for [**Company 2676**] for 34 years prior to that.


Family History:
Significant for end-stage renal disease in father and mother.
History of hypertension, diabetes and coronary artery disease in
father.  History of seizure disorder in mother. Father had some
cancer and Mr [**Known lastname 1557**] is unsure of the type of cancer.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a
distal
40-50% lesion.  The LAD had a proximal stent that was patent,
and was
totally occluded in the mid vessel.  The LCx had diffuse
disease.  The
OM1 was 80-90% stenosed.  The RCA was a large vessel with mild,
diffuse
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided
filling
pressure with RVEDP 13mmHg.  There was Mild pulmonary arterial
systolic
hypertension with PASP of 41mmHg.  The cardiac index was
preserved at
2.8 l/min/m2.  There was moderate stetemic arterial systoli cand

diastolic hypertension with SBP of 190mmHg and DBP 115mmHg.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systemic arterial hypertension.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptal and anterior
akinesis and apical akinesis. No apical thrombus identified.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a very small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2139-7-24**],
left ventricular systolic function is now moderately impaired
with regional wall motion abnormality consistent with anterior
myocardial infarction. There is a very small pericardial
effusion in the current study.

This study was compared to the pr
