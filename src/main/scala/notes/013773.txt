History of Present Illness:

hemiparesis and speech difficulties, referred for carotid
angiography and possible revascularization. He [**Month/Day (2) 1834**]
successful stenting but then had acute alteration in mental
status with severe agitation. He was disoriented and could not
be calmed after numerous attempts by staff and family. Patient
was hypertensive w/ SBP 200s, sats stable. He was placed on NTG
drip, became normotensive, but still remained very agitated.
There was a concern for head bleed given altered mental status
and elevated BP. However, pt was not cooperative for a head CT
and needed to be sedated and intubated. A central line was
placed to provide pressor for regulation of BP as pt was on
fentanyl, versed drips. Pt was paralyzed w/ atracuronium and
sent for head CT which was normal.

Imaging Studies:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-8-24**] 8:36 PM
No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage is identified. There is no
mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. Again seen
are lacunar infarcts in the right basal ganglia as well as a
region of hypodensity in the white matter in the right Insula,
unchanged. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white differentiation appears well preserved.
.
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate mucosal thickening of ethmoid
air cells and the left maxillary sinus. No soft tissue
abnormalities are seen.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. If concern for acute ischemia of the brain persists,
diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-8-24**] 6:57 PM
Compared with [**2152-11-27**], an ET tube has been placed. The tip lies
in satisfactory position approximately 5.8 cm above the carina.
The patient is status post MVR with sternotomy wires. There is
mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly, with unfolding and calcification
of the aorta. There is mild pulmonary vascular plethora,
suggesting very mild CHF. No gross effusion. Left costophrenic
angle excluded from the film.
.
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-8-25**] 4:10 PM
There are small areas of hyperintense signal seen in the right
cerebral hemisphere involving the right posterior temporal,
right occipital and right posterior frontal regions without
corresponding abnormalities on FLAIR images and suggestive of
small acute infarcts. There is no mass effect or midline shift
seen. Minimal changes of small vessel disease are seen in the
periventricular white matter. Mucosal thickening is seen in both
maxillary sinuses and fluid is seen in the nasopharynx, which
could be secondary to intubation. A small focus of
susceptibility seen in the right posterior temporal region
indicative of microhemorrhage which could be due to previous
ischemia or could be due to amyloid angiopathy.

IMPRESSION: Small foci of high signal on the diffusion images in
the right temporal, occipital and posterior frontal regions
suggestive of small acute infarcts. Minimal changes of small
vessel disease.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-8-25**] 2:12 PM
Tip of the ETT appears a bit higher than prior at 7.1 cm above
the carina. This could be advanced at least 3 cm. There is a
left CVL seen with the tip in the SVC and no PTX. The NGT
remains in place. There is no PTX and the lungs remain clear.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-8-25**] 12:00 AM
NG tube is present, extending into the stomach, with the tip
curled in the stomach. The tip of the endotracheal tube remains
5.5 cm above the carina. Sternotomy sutures are present as well
as mitral valve annulus, as seen previously.
.
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are probably within normal
limits allowing for the technique. There are no focal pulmonary
opacities, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax.
.
IMPRESSION: NG tube extends into the stomach, with the tip
curled in the stomach.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-8-26**] 7:03 AM
Lines and tubes remain in place, although, I cannot clearly
identify the distal aspect of the NGT. There is no new
consolidation and some blunting ofthe left CP angle is
unchanged. Pulmonary vascular markings are within normal limits
and the heart size is mildly enlarged. There is no pneumothorax.
.
IMPRESSION:
No significant interval change versus prior. No radiographic
explanation for the patient's fever.

Brief Hospital Course:
74yo russian speaking male with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, s/p L carotid
stent and now s/p right carotid stent complicated by acute
mental status changes. MRI required intubation, sedation,
phenylephrine for BP support, revealed three small microinfarcts
likely unrelated to encephalopathic picture.
.
NEURO
# Mental status changes
Patient was transferred to the cardiac care unit for hemodynamic
monitoring after having a right internal carotid artery stent.
Patient was noted to have acute alteration in mental status
immediately after teh procedure with agitation, combativeness,
disorientation, and confusion. Patient was not cooperative and
was shouting profane words in Russian, while pulling at lines
and foley. According to family, patient's mental status was
normal before the procedure, without symptoms of psychosis or
dementia. Patient was also hypertensive with SBP in 200s. There
was obvious concern for an embolic stroke secondary to carotid
stenting or hemorrhagic event due to high BP. He required
sedation and intubation for urgent head CT and MRI scan to
evaluate for CVA.
.
Head CT was negative for bleed or infarcts. MRI of head showed
small foci of high signal on the diffusion images in the right
temporal, occipital and posterior frontal regions suggestive of
small acute infarcts. Given very small foci of bright signal on
DWI, likely diagnosis was toxic/metabolic/infectious causes of
confusional state or dye contrast-induced encephalopathy. MRI
abnormalities were likely caused by small emboli from carotid
manipulation but they are insufficient to explain
encephalopathic state.
.
Patient was extubated after brain imaging and wa
