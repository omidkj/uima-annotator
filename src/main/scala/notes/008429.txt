excision of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament.
2. Anterior cervical deformity correction.
3. Interbody reconstruction.

5. Plate instrumentation, C5-C6-C7.
6. Cervical laminectomy C6-C7, T1.
7. Posterior cervical arthrodesis C4-T1.
8. Cervical instrumentation C4-T1.
9. Arthrodesis augmentation with autograft, allograft and
demineralized bone matrix.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1829**] is a 82 year old male who had a slip and fall
of approximately 10 feet from a balcony.  He was ambulatory at
the scene.  He presented to the ED here at [**Hospital1 18**].  CT scan
revealed unstable C spine fracture.  He was intubated secondary
to agitation.

==================
   RADIOLOGY
==================

CT scan C spine [**2162-3-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fracture of the C6 as described involving the right pedicle
(extending to the inferior facet) and left lamina. Anterior
widening at the C6-7 disc space and mild widening of left C6-7
facet also noted. Prevertebral hematoma at C6 with likely
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

2.  Lucency in the right posterior C1 ring may represent a
chronic injury.
Likely old avulsion fracture at T2 pedicle on the left.

3. Ossification of both anterior and posterior longitudinal
ligaments with
compromise of the central spinal canal. Degenerative disease is
further
described above.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ([**2162-3-3**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute injuries in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.
2. Three discrete pleural fluid collections in the right
hemithorax, likely pseudotumors.
3. Small hypodense lesion in the pancreatic body is of unclear
etiology, may represent pseudicyst or cystic tumor. Further
evaluation with MRI may be performed on a non- emergent basis.
4. Bilateral renal cysts.
5. Foley catheter balloon inflated within the prostatic urethra.
Recommend emergent repositioning.

CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL ([**2162-3-3**])
1. Bilateral nasal bone fractures.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma with preseptal soft tissue
swelling. Question foreign body anterior to the left globe.
Recommend clinical correlation. Small amount of extraconal
hematoma in the superior aspect of the left orbit.
3. Linear lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Correlate
with CT C- spine performed concurrently.

HEAD CT ([**2162-3-3**])
1. No acute intracranial hemprrhage.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma.
3. Nasal bone fractures. Recommend correlation with report from
facial bone CT scan.
4. Lucency in the right posterior ring of C1. Please refer to
dedeicated CT C-spine for further detail.
5. Left cerebellar encephalomalacia, likely due to old
infarction.

CHEST [**2162-3-10**]
The Dobbhoff tube passes below the diaphragm with its tip most
likely terminating in the stomach. The bilateral pacemakers are
demonstrated with one lead terminating in right atrium and three
leads terminating in right ventricle. The patient is in mild
pulmonary edema with no change in the loculated pleural fluid
within the major fissure.

CT HEAD [**2162-3-11**]
1. A tiny amount of intraventricular hemorrhage layers along the
occipital horns of the ventricles bilaterally. Recommend followp
imaging.
2. Left frontal scalp hematoma has decreased in size.
3. Unchanged left cerebellar encephalomalacia.
4. Nasal bone fractures are better evaluated on dedicated
maxillofacial CT.

RIGHT SHOULDER X-RAY ([**2162-3-11**])
Mild glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis.
Nonspecific ossification projecting over the upper margin of the
scapular body and adjacent to the lesser tuberosity. Diagnostic
considerations include the sequela of chronic calcific bursitis,
intraarticular bodies, and/or calcific tendinitis of the
subscapularis tendon.
Increased opacity projecting over the right hemithorax and minor
fissure, better delineated on recent chest radiographs and chest
CT

RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND ([**2162-3-13**])
1. Deep venous thrombosis in the right axillary vein, extending
proximally into the right subclavian vein, and distally to
involve the brachial veins, portion of the basilic vein, and the
right cephalic vein.
2. Likely 2.0 cm left axillary lymph node, with unusual
son[**Name (NI) 493**] features somewhat suspicious for malignancy.
Followup ultrasound is recommended in 4 weeks, and FNA/biopsy
may be considered at that time if no interval improvement.

[**2162-3-14**]
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There are small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, on the right with a loculated
appearance. There is associated compressive atelectasis. The
visualized portion of the heart suggests mild cardiomegaly.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is a 9-mm
hypoattenuating, well-defined lesion in the left lobe of the
liver (2:12) too small to accurately characterize but
statistically most likely representing a cyst. There are
bilateral, partially exophytic renal cysts. The spleen is normal
in size. There is a 5-mm hypoattenuating focus in the pancreatic
body, most likely representing focal fat. The gallbladder and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. An NG tube terminates in the
stomach. There is no ascites. The large and small bowel loops
appear unremarkable without wall thickening or pneumatosis. Oral
contrast material has passed into the ascending colon without
evidence of obstruction. There is no ascites and no free air.
There is a small pocket of air in the left rectus muscle,
tracking over a distance of approximately 10 cm.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The pelvic small and large bowel
loops, collapsed bladder containing Foley catheter and seminal
vesicles appear unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged,
measuring 5.9 cm in transverse diameter. The rectum contains a
moderate amount of dried stool. There is no free air or free
fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is
DISH of the entire visualized thoracolumbar spine. There also
are degenerative changes about the hip joints with large
acetabular osteophytes.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral pl
