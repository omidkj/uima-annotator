Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lobe liver mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-7-10**] Exploratory laparotomy, common bile duct lymph node
biopsy x2, intraoperative ultrasound, wedge liver biopsy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was recently hospitalized
at [**Hospital1 18**] from [**6-24**] through [**2201-7-3**], for evaluation of
jaundice.  He was found to have an intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma with apparent involvement down to the level
of the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts with
possible extrinsic
compression or extension into the bile ducts.  The cytology from
his ERCP was positive for malignant cells.  CA19-9 was markedly
elevated at 35,188.  A triphasic CT scan demonstrated a 7 mm
lung nodule in the right upper lobe and
ground-glass nodules left lower lobe that will require interval
follow-up but do not appear to represent metastatic disease at
this time.  His abdominal CT demonstrated a 5.8 x 5.9 x 5.2 cm
mass in segment 7 and segment 6 of the liver.
It is closely adjacent to the surgical clips from his prior
cholecystectomy and closely abuts the IVC where there is no
definite distinct border.  The right portal vein, both anterior
and posterior segments are occluded.  He does have intrahepatic
biliary dilatation on both the right and the left.  He underwent
preoperative placement of bilateral transhepatic catheter for
decompression of the bile duct and to facilitate surgical
resection should that be necessary. He is now brought to the
operating room for right hepatic lobectomy, possible common bile
duct excision and possible Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy.  He
has provided informed consent.

.
DIAGNOSIS:
  I.  Common duct lymph node, excision (A-B):
Fragments of lymph node with no carcinoma seen (0/1).
.
 II.  Distal common duct lymph node, excision (C-D):
Metastatic adenocarcinoma involving one lymph node ([**2-8**]).
.
III.  Liver mass, targeted excisional biopsy (E):
Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated in this sample.
.
.
[**2201-7-15**] CTA Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the main
pulmonary arteries with possible associated  right heart strain.

2.  Centrilobular emphysema.
3.  External and internal biliary drains are partially seen in
the upper
abdomen.
.
[**2201-7-15**] Cardiac Echo:
IMPRESSION: poor technical quality study. Left ventricular
function is probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular dilatation (not
quantified due to suboptimal image quality). No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] presented on [**2201-7-10**] for planned surgical intervention
for his locally advanced cholangiocarcinoma.  After appropriate
preparation and informed consent was obtained, he underwent
exploratory laparotomy, CBD lymph node biopsies, intraoperative
ultrasound, and wedge liver biopsy, which he tolerated well.
After a brief stay in the PACU, Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] was admitted to the
hepatobiliary surgical service for post-operative monitoring and
recovery.
.
On POD1, he was advanced to sips, and was out of bed to the
chair on the hepatobiliary pathway.  His home losartan was
restarted.
.
On POD2, clear liquids were started, which he tolerated well,
his IV fluids were heplocked and he was transitioned to oral
pain medication.  His foley catheter was removed at midnight and
he voided without difficulty.  He was ambulating with PT and
family.
.
On [**7-13**], the PTBD drain (placed to gravity drainage intra-op) was
capped, and he was advanced to a regular diet, which he
tolerated well.  His home medications were resumed and he
continued to ambulate independently.
.
On [**7-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] continued to tolerated a regular diet,
ambulate, and report good pain control with oral medication.
Discharge planning was underway for [**7-15**], however, overnight on
[**5-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] developed new shortness of breath and oxygen
requirement.  He was found to be tachycardic to the 110s.  CXR
revealed evidence of large scale pulmonary edema, and an urgent
CTA of the chest revealed large bilateral pulmonary emboli.  A
heparin drip was initiated, and Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] was initially stable
on 2L NC.
.
On [**7-15**] AM, new ectopy and persistent tachycardia were concerning
for right heart strain, and Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] was transferred to the
surgical ICU for close monitoring.  Echocardiography revealed
mild RV dilation without valvular dysfunction, and his heparin
drip was continued.  An arterial line was placed to facilitate
timely PTT monitoring and hemodynamic.  He remained otherwise
hemodynamically stable, tolerating a regular diet, and oral
medications.
.
On [**7-16**], he was ambulating, maintaining good oxygen saturation on
room air.
.
On [**7-17**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] was transitioned to lovenox and the heparin
drip weaned to off.  He was transferred to the surgical floor
for additional monitoring and discharge planning.  Lovenox
prescription was called in to his home pharmacy.
.
On [**7-18**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating
independently (cleared by PT), reporting good pain control on
oral medication, and maintaining good oxygen saturation on room
air without shortness of breath.  He and his family received
lovenox teaching and demonstrated their ability to provide his
treatment at home.  He was deemed stable for discharge on [**Hospital1 **]
lovenox with close follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the hepatobiliary
surgical clinic.  His PTBD drains x2 were capped and intact.
VNA service was arranged for drain care.  Prescriptions for pain
medication and a bowel regimen were provided.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] will
continue his Cipro for cholangitis prophylaxis.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1557**] and
his family understood these instructions and agreed with the
plan, and he was discharged to home with his family in good
condition on [**2201-7-18**].
.
Discharge plans were communicated with the transplant surgery
clinic coordinators via email on [**2201-7-18**].
