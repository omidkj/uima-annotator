.
CXR ([**2163-2-16**]) Markedly limited examination.  The study is
degraded by respiratory motion and body habitus.  No gross
consolidation is noted; however, there is a subtle increased
density within both lung bases, particularly in the retrocardiac
left lower lobe.  The mediastinum is grossly stable.  Lung
volumes are markedly diminished likely accentuating the cardiac
silhouette size, although there is a left ventricular
predominance noted.  There is slightly asymmetrical left apical
pleural thickening noted.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The bones
are diffusely osteopenic with degenerative changes throughout
the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:  Markedly limited study.  Suggestion of bibasilar
opacities,
likely atelectasis; however, early developing pneumonias cannot
be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 y/o female admitted with sepsis, believed from pulmonary
source, initially admitted to MICU and called out after rapid
improvement.
.
#. Septic shock: This was thought most likely to be due to
pneumonia. The pt never had clear infiltrate on CXR, however she
did have an impressive bandemia at the time of admission and
subsequently had an elevated WBC count. The pt grew S. Pneumo
and staph non-aureus from her sputum and staph non-aureus from
one blood culture bottle. She was briefly on levophed in the
MICU although blood pressures quickly improved with treatment.
.
#. Pneumonia: The pt was initiated on broad spectrum emperic
coverage (levofloxacin, vanocymicin and Zosyn) for presumed PNA.
When her culture results returned, she was continued on
levofloxacin and vancomycin only.
.
#. Acute renal failure: The pt's Cr was 1.5 at the time of
admission. This was thought to be due to a prerenal state in the
setting of poor PO intake and sepsis. Her Cr improved with IV
hydration and with the normalization of her overall clinical
status. It was 0.9 at the time of discharge.
.
#. AF: During her hospital course, the pt was noted to be in AF
much of the time with poor rate control. Based on a review of
old records, it appeared that she was not anticoagulated because
her AF burden was thought to be very low. As this did not appear
to be the case during her stay, anticoagulation was initiated
and the pt's beta blocker was titrated up to achieve better rate
control. Prior to discharge, the pt's INR was elevated to as
high as 7; she was given vitamin K and her INR was 1.4 on the
day of discharge. She had been receieving 5 mg daily; a dose of
2 mg a day, with frequent INR checks, is advised, particularly
as antibiotics are discontinued.
.
#. CAD: The pt's home ASA was continued. Plavix was stopped as
the pt is more than one year post-stent and she was started on
anticoagulation.
.
#. DM type II: The pt was maintained on an insulin sliding
scale. Her sugars were well-controlled.
.
#. Seizure disorder: Home Dilantin was continued.
.
# COPD: The pt's home albuterol and ipratropium were continued.
.
#: Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine was continued.
.
#: Hypercholesterolemia: Home statin was continued.
