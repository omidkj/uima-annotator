History of Present Illness:
 53 yo F with a questionable history of prior post-surgical PE,
COPD and bullous emphysemia admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2190-9-18**] with a septic bursitis of the right knee, transferred
with acute onset hypoxia, hypotension, and tachycardia.
.
One day after attending a town fair (approximately 3-4 days
prior to admission) the patient noted right knee swelling and
discomfort. The patient attributed her symptoms to walking and
standing at the fair and took ibuprofen. Her pain and swelling
worsened. Over the following 2 days the patient developed
associated fevers, chills. She noted malaise and general
fatigue. She also endorsed a severe headache and loose stool
with associated bowel incontinence. With this constellation of
symptoms, the patient presented on [**2190-9-17**] to the [**Hospital 11373**] ED at 2345. She was noted to have a leukocytosis (14)
with bandemia (6) and to be in acute renal failure (Cr 2.1). The
patient underwent drainage of her right knee bursitis revealing
many gram positive cocci in clusters. She also had a negative
head CT and negative LP.
.
The patient was admitted to the medicine floor where she was
started on Kefzol 1g IV q6h out of concern for a septic
bursitis. Overnight with IV hydration, the patient's renal
failure resolved. On the medical floor within 24 hours of the
time of transfer, the patient developed abrupt onset of
hypoxemia, tachycardia and hypotension (with a ?chest pain?).
She was transferred to the [**Location (un) **] ICU. In the ICU, she was
noted to be in new-onset A. Fib with a troponin leak (0.14). She
received a total digoxin 0.75 mg. There was high concern for a
PE. The patient was felt too unstable to travel for a CTA and
she was started empirically on heparin gtt. Thrombolysis was
considered though her recent LP was felt to be a
contraindication. She received 3500cc NS over the last 24 hours.
She was noted to have respiratory distress following this
administration and she was given small dose of furosemide for
possible volume overload. She required a neosynephrine drip to
maintain blood pressure. A Swan-ganz catheter was placed. Her
pre-transfer CO 4.93, Index 3.01, PA 38/20, RA 11, PCWP 17, SVR
8.6, PVR 1.46. Prior to transfer she received 1amp calcium
gluconate for SVR 6.
.
ROS: Prior to admission, no chest pain, shortness of breath,
abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia, hematuria, dysuria,
hematemesis, hemoptysis, productive cough, sick contacts.

Imaging:
Chest CT [**9-19**]:
1. No central pulmonary embolism, however, it is not possible to
exclude a subsegmental pulmonary embolism due to extensive
interstitial lung change, pleural effusions, and atelectasis at
lung bases.
2. Extensive emphysematous changes along with interstitial and
subpleural pulmonary fibrosis, the appearances may represent
NSIP along with superimposed cardiac failure.
3. Scattered enlarged mediastinal and subcentimeter bilateral
axillary lymph nodes.
.
TTE [**9-20**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal (abnormal septal motion).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 35632**] [**9-27**]:
1. Marked prepatellar bursitis. Equivocal overlying soft tissue
defect along the anterolateral knee is seen and correlation with
physical exam is requested.
2. Moderate joint effusion.
.
CTA [**10-1**]:
1. No visualized pulmonary embolus.
2. Interval worsening of multilobar pneumonia, likely explaining
increased hypoxia.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions.
4. No change in extensive emphysema with fibrosis and bilateral
upper lobe destruction.
.
TTE [**10-1**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-9-20**],
left ventricular systolic function is improved (septal motion is
now normal) and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is higher.
.
CXR [**10-6**]: The endotracheal tube, upper mediastinal drain, left
subclavian catheter, and nasogastric tube are stable in
satisfactory position. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits. There has been slight improvemen
