History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 yo female with cryptogenic cirrhosis and esophageal
varices, diastolic CHF requiring multiple hospitalizations in
the past for exacerbation, who had presented to the [**Hospital **]
hospital on [**3-16**] (?[**3-15**]) with ARF and hypotension. [**2-20**] wks prior
to admission pt was complaining of worsening fatigue and
insominia, PCP was concerned for recurrent CHF exacerbation and
hence increased lasix x2 over a course of 2 weeks. Given ongoing
symptoms of malaise and fatigue pt presented to OSH, where she
was found to be ind ARF and hypotensive. Her hospital [**Last Name (un) 10128**] was
marked by ICU stay and work up for infection and cardiogenic
shock, which was negative. Her renal function did not recover
and patient was started on HD the day prior to transfer. On the
day of transfer patient started vomiting BRB during dialysis,
requiring a total of 5 RBc and 1 unit of plt, EGD revieled 3
cords, of which one was successfully banded. Pt transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further managment
.
On the floor, pt arrived sedated on propofol, and octreotide
drip, with right HD cath IJ, on vent. 30 cc of BRB in
oropharynx.

ECG [**2125-3-21**]
Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation with controlled rate is
suggested. Low voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2124-5-25**] the rhythm has changed and the voltage is now lower.

.
EGD report OSH: single colum cord one band placed, grade II
varices
EKG: sinus rythm, no signs of ischemia
.
CXR [**2125-3-22**]
Widespread severe pulmonary opacification could be all edema,
but the
heterogeneous quality in the left lung suggests pneumonia and a
3-cm wide
nodular opacity projecting superior to the left hilus could be a
lung mass.  Moderate right and smaller left pleural effusion
have increased since [**5-29**].  Heart is normal size. Leftward
shift of the lower mediastinum indicates some volume loss in the
left lower lobe. ET tube and nasogastric tube are in standard
placements and a right jugular line ends at the junction of the
brachiocephalic veins.
.
Renal U/S [**2125-3-22**]
1. No hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or solid renal mass.
2. Renal parenchymal changes consistent with medical renal
disease.
3. Bilateral renal cysts.
4. Ascites and right pleural effusion
5. Splenomegaly.
.
CXR [**2125-3-22**]
IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary edema. Unchanged pulmonary
opacities. CT is recommended if left suprahilar opacity persists
after resolution of acute chest pathology.
.
CXR [**2125-3-24**]
IMPRESSION: Tubes and catheters in expected position. Increased
moderate right and small left pleural effusion with increase in
basilar opacity, could be aspiration or pneumonia. Minimal
interstitial edema.
.
CXR [**2125-3-26**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-25**], the left subclavian
catheter
has been pulled back to the mid portion of the SVC. Persistent
moderate,
partially loculated right pleural effusion. Left retrocardiac
opacification persists, most likely related to a combination of
atelectasis and effusion, though superimposed pneumonia cannot
be excluded.
.
ECHO [**2125-3-24**]
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function and elevated
cardiac index. Elevated ventricular filling pressures. At least
moderate pulmonary hypertension. Moderately dilated right
ventricle with borderline normal function. Trivial aortic and
mild mitral regurgitation.
.
EGD [**2125-3-24**]
#Varices at the lower third of the esophagus and
gastroesophageal junction
#Congestion, petechiae and mosaic appearance in the whole
stomach compatible with portal hypertensive gastropathy
#Normal mucosa in the duodenum
#Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
Right Upper Extremity Ultrasound [**2125-3-25**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.




Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo female with cryptogenic cirrhosis and esophageal varices,
diastolic CHF requiring multiple hospitalizations in the past
for exacerbation, who had presented to the [**Hospital **] hospital
[**2125-3-16**] with acute renal failure, hypotension, and
gastrointestinal bleeding.
.
# Variceal bleed: Outside hospital EGD showed one esophageal
varix that was banded. The patient received five units PRBCs and
one unit platelets prior to transfer from outside hospital. On
