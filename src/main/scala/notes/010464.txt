fractures, admitted [**Date range (1) 51787**] during which time had ex lap,
trach and peg admitted s/p PE arrest. Per his wife, he was
feeling dyspnicon the day of admission, + b/l swelling. She
notes that on leaving [**Hospital1 **] that he had increased upper

medication administration. He was placed on a monitor and found
to be bradycardic to 40's, BP was 100/50. Pt was given 1mg IV
Atropine X 1 with HR response to 135.  During this episode, he
was noted to have vomited and vomitous was suctioned from his
trach. Sent to ED.
.
In ED, the patient was arousable but drowsy. CXR was read as
normal. CTA neg for PE. No EKG changes. The patient received
levo/flagyl for aspiration PNA.

.
[**2144-12-17**] Head CT: no acute intracranial process
.
[**2144-12-17**]: Chest Xray: Bilateral diffuse alveolar opacities,
which could represent pulmonary edema, aspiration, or diffuse
infectious process.  Satisfactory positioning of tracheostomy
tube.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**2144-12-17**] CTA Chest/Abd/Pelvis: no PE, bilateral basilar
consolidation suggestive of atelectasis, pneumonia, or
aspiration.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion but no pleural
effusion.  Interval removal of gastric band; however,
gastrostomy tube is still present within the stomach.  Mild
anasarca.  Multiple mediastinal and hilar nodes which could be
reactive, but would recommend follow up imaging evaluation for
resolution.  Left anterior intraabdominal nodule, not seen on
prior study and may represent a lymph node. Follow up
examination is recommended to evaluate for interval change.
.
[**2144-12-18**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 1. Minimal amount of free fluid in the
perihepatic space and deep pelvis, new when compared to prior
exam. No evidence of retroperitoneal bleed. 2. Otherwise, no
significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with loss of conscious
and bradycardia.  He was thought to have possibly had a mucous
plug in the setting of pneumonia and CHF with edema.  It is
unclear if he was pulseless, however a pulse could not be felt
and chest compressions were started.  When hooked up to the
monitor, he was in sinus rhythm at a rate of 40.  He was given
atropine and HR improved.  In the ED, a CTA of the chest showed
no PE and CT of the abd/pelvis showed no intra-abdominal
pathology.  On arrival to the MICU, he was given Vanc/Zosyn for
possible pneumonia.  The Zosyn was stopped the following day and
the Vancomycin continued for MRSA in the sputum, later felt to
be a contaminate or colonization given his improvement.  His CXR
showed pulmonary edema and he was given Lasix for diuresis.
Telemetry showed no arrhythmias.  ECG showed no ischemic changes
and cardiac enzymes were negative.  He was diuresed and
improved.  Echo showed normal systolic function but severe
diastolic dysfunction.  It was felt that he did not have a
pneumonia and that his sputum was likely colonization and the
vancomycin was stopped.  He improved with diuresis and he likely
had pulmonary edema contributing to his respiratory status.  He
was weaned from the ventilator over 4 days and tolerated a trach
mask for several days before discharge.  His Metoprolol was
initially held due to his bradycardia but this was restarted
prior to discharge as his heart rate tolerated it.  He was
restarted on a lower dose of Metoprolol of 25mg PO BID due to
bradycardia on admission.  This can be titrated up as tolerated
to his home dose of 50mg PO BID.  He was restarted on 25 mg
Cozar on [**2144-12-23**] for blood pressure control. His aspirin,
imdur, amlodipine and hydralazine were continued for blood
pressure control and coronary artery disease.  He was continued
on his Lantus and insulin sliding scale for diabetes management.

.
He was anemic upon admission which was not new.  His hematocrit
trended down to 19 on [**2144-12-18**] and he was transfuse
