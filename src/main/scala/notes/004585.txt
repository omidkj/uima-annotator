Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement

History of Present Illness:
76 yo woman with end stage COPD s/p trach in [**2-3**] and on/off
vent since, transferred here for fever and increased lethargy.
She was recently discharged from hospital to [**Hospital 38**] Rehab on
[**2-19**] after being weaned off vent. However, her mental status had
remained very poor (barely responsive) for the past few week.
She had to go back on vent a week ago due to worsening resp
status. She has various bacteria growing out of her sputum,
urine and blood. She has documented serratia and pseudomonas in
sputum, serratia and coag negative staph in blood, and VRE and
[**Female First Name (un) **] in urine. She has been treated with Amikacin and
levofloxacin for the serratia infection and vancomycin for coag
negative staph. However, she continued to deteriorate with the
treatment and her family requested her to be transferred to
hospital for evaluation. She came to [**Hospital1 18**] as [**Hospital **] Hosp didn't
have an ICU bed.

Past Medical History:
1. End-Stage COPD
2. Tracheostomy, intermittently vent dependent
3. Dementia
4. Type II Diabetes
5. Coronary Artery Disease
6. Congestive Heart Failure
7. Chronic Renal Failure
8. Atrial Fibrillation

Social History:
Has been at vent rehab over last year with intermittent
hospitalizations.

Family History:
non contributory

Physical Exam:
VS. T96.2 82 146/47 PS10/5 350 18 0.5
GENERAL: Minimally responsive,
NECK: Right IJ
CARDIOVASCULAR: S1, S2, [**Last Name (un) **], II/VI LUSB
LUNGS: Soft, coarse sounds bilaterally
ABDOMEN: Soft, NT, ND, obese, no rebound or guarding
EXTREMITIES: [**3-4**]+ UE and LE edema
NEURO: Awake, moving all four extremities, but not following
commands, unable to cooperate with exam.


Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2184-3-10**] 4:32 AM
1) No acute intracranial abnormality visualized.
2) Global brain atrophy, prominent in degree.
3) Mild chronic small vessel ischemic infarcts.

CT TORSO W/CONTRAST  [**2184-3-16**] 9:21 PM
1. Diffuse soft tissue edema/anasarca.
2. No focal fluid collections suggestive of abscess.
3. Bilateral loculated pleural effusions.
4. Gallstone without evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Fat stranding surrounding the rectum, which seems
disproportionate to the degree of edema, may represent
inflammatory etiology, although evaluation of the pelvis is
limited by metallic hardware within the hips.

ECHO Study Date of [**2184-3-10**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. A focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2184-3-20**]):
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an

      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
