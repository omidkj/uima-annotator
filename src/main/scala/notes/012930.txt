Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
63 y/oF with h/o of COPD with multiple admissions and
intubations (last [**5-6**]) most recently admitted on [**7-6**] who
presents to the ED with severe resp distres of 24-48h. No
fever/CP/vomiting. Home o2, nebs didn't improve symptoms. Of
note, she has difficulty paying for her medications, and has
been without the serevent recently, as well as the clopidogrel
since her discharge from rehab on [**2206-7-22**]. She has been having
some cough more last week, less so most recently.
Her symptoms include chest tightness, which is not entirely
typical with her straight COPD admissions according to her. Her
chest tightness in the ICU improved with nebulizer treatment,
and she denies any frank chest pain, jaw pain, or pleuritic
pain.
In the ED, she was treated with 3 combivent nebs, steroids,
azithromycin. Sats have been okay, mainly tachypnea and
tachycardia which were symptoms. Lungs were diffusely wheezy and
she was initially limited in her speech, though this improved
with the above treatment. Her labwork was notable for a trop of
0.03, but CK of 55 and ECG without acute changes.

Pertinent Results:
CBC on admission notable for WBC of 16.3 that fluctuated down to
12 and up to 19.3 on discharge, thought possibly due to steroids
in absence of other infectious signs and fever.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The
pulmonary arteries are normally opacified without filling
defect. The heart size is normal. The coronary arteries and
thoracic aorta are densely calcified. There is no pleural or
pericardial effusion. Upper lobe predominant centrilobular
emphysema is severe. Patchy opacity in the dependent portions of
the lower lobes is suggestive of atelectasis. There is no
concerning parenchymal opacity. The central lymph nodes are not
enlarged.

The bones show no lesion worrisome for osseous metastasis.
Multiple small
bilateral chronic rib fractures and severe kyphotic angulation
of the thoracic spine with compression deformity of the T5, T6,
T7, T8, and T9 vertebral  bodies are unchanged. Limited
evaluation of subdiaphragmatic structures show 2.6cm cyst
arising from the upper pole of the left kidney and dense aortic
atherosclerotic calcifications.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. Severe emphysema.


Brief Hospital Course:
COPD Exacerbation:
Ms. [**Known lastname 17327**] was treated in the emergency room with nebs, IV
steroids, and started on azithromycin. She was admitted to the
medical ICU for consideration of bipap support with a full code
status. She did not require mechanical ventilation or bipap, and
had improvement over the next 24 hours. She was switched to oral
steroids starting at prednisone 60mg, with plan for taper over
approximately 3 weeks to a baseline of 10mg of prednisone
continuously. She was started on advair, and continued on her
monteleukast, albuterol and ipratropium. She had a CTA which
ruled out comorbid PE, and showed bronchiectasis and stigmata of
chronic aspiration.

At discharge she remained quite wheezy, but with good air
movement and an overall improvement from when she was admitted.
She will continue to need supportive care for her COPD at rehab.


Given her chronic steroids for COPD exacerbation, we suggested
that she discuss PCP prophylaxis with her outpatient pulmonary
physician, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**]. We recommended vitamin D and calcium
supplementation.

Coronary Artery Disease:
She did have the complaint of chest tightness on admission,
though this was due to her COPD rather than coronary disease
given absence of ischemic ECG changes and rule-out with two
spaced sets of cardiac biomarkres. Given her history of drug
eluting stent in [**2201**], she was restarted on her clopidogrel.
However, she remained off of aspirin given prior decisions, and
history of perforated ulcer.

Chronic Pain:
The patient was restarted on a fentanyl patch and percocet for
her chronic back pain. She was also continued on nortryptyline.
