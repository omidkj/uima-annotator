Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F, HTN, DM2, breast ca., hypercholesterolemia and history of
LGIB (diverticuli and internal hemmorhoids) presenting with

(spotting 1-2 times a day). Last night, passed increased amount
of blood with stool that took a bit longer than normal to stop,
In the morning she had some BRBPR without stool so she decided
to come. She has had some gassy abdominal pain and chronic
baseline rectal pain from rectal prolapse, but been otherwise
asymptomatic. She denies lightheadedness, palpitations, chest
pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, melena, diarrhea,
constipation.

so. she denies any weakness, and ambulates, but she states that
at times the pain migrates to her left knee and limits her
mobility.
.
In ED, she received one L NS and had a hct of 34, which is down
3 points from her latest in [**2139-10-25**], though her chronic
baseline over the last two years seems to bump between 32 and
37.

[**Numeric Identifier 7536**] EMBO NON NEURO  [**2140-2-4**] 3:14 AM

Reason: Mesenteric angiogram with possible atheroembolization
Contrast: VISAPAQUE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with h/o hemmorrhoids, diverticulosis with
lower GI bleed, tagged scan shows bleeding at distal left colon
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Mesenteric angiogram with possible atheroembolization
INDICATION: Patient with history of hemorrhoids and
diverticulosis with lower GI hemorrhage. Tagged red blood cell
scan shows bleeding at the distal left colon. Please perform
arteriogram and possible embolization.

RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed the
procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**], the attending radiologist, was present
and supervising throughout.

PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained. A
preprocedure timeout was performed. The patient was placed
supine on the angiography table, and the right groin was prepped
and draped in sterile fashion. 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was used for
local anesthesia. By palpation, a 19-gauge Seldinger needle was
advanced into the right common femoral artery directly over the
femoral head. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire was advanced into the abdominal
aorta and the puncture needle was exchanged for a 5-French
sheath. A 4-French Sos Omni selective catheter was utilized to
access the orifice of the superior mesenteric artery. A superior
mesenteric arteriogram was performed demonstrating the SMA and
its branches to be widely patent without evidence of
extravasation. Attempts to cannulate the orifice of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] with
the Sos selective catheter were unsuccessful. Thus, the Omni
selective catheter was exchanged for an Omniflush catheter, and
an aortogram was performed. The aortogram demonstrated patent
bilateral renal arteries, an accessory renal artery on the left,
the inferior mesenteric artery and lumbar arteries. Using this
arteriogram as a guide, the orifice of the inferior mesenteric
artery was then cannulated with a 5-French Mickaelson catheter.
The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] arteriogram was performed in frontal and oblique
projections, demonstrating a focus of active arterial
extravasation at the junction of the descending and sigmoid
colon. A Tracker microcatheter was advanced into the inferior
mesenteric artery, selctively into a distal branch of the left
colic artery. Contrast injection at this locale confirmed
extravasation from this branch. Based on the diagnostic
findings, it was decided that the patient would benefit from and
was a good candidate for embolization. Two 1 cm x 2 mm coils
were deployed at this level. Subsequent superselective
arteriogram from the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] demonstrated occlusion of the arterial
branch responsible for the bleeding. The catheters were removed
and the angiographic sheath was pulled. Manual compression was
applied to the right groin until complete hemostasis was
achieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there
were no immediate complications.

Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
Versed and fentanyl throughout the total intraservice time of 2
hours, during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were
continuously monitored. A total both of 25 mcg of fentanyl and
0.5 mg of Versed were administered. Approximately 180 cc of
Visipaque contrast was administered throughout the procedure.

IMPRESSION:
1. Superselective arteriogram from the [**Female First Name (un) 899**] demonstrated a focus
of active arterial extravasation near the junction of the
descending and sigmoid colon.

2. Coil embolization of a left colic [**Last Name (un) **] of the [**Female First Name (un) 899**], with a
good angiographic result.


Brief Hospital Course:
# GI Bleed
On the floor she was initially hemodynamically stable with
stable hematocrits.  She had a colonoscopy which showed
diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, descending colon,
transverse colon and ascending colon and blood distal to the
distal transverse colon. [**2-3**] EGD showed gastritis, duodenal
ulceration and a clot in the fundus.  She then returned to the
floor and several hours later started having cupfuls of BRBPR.
She remained hemodynamically stable. She had a central
