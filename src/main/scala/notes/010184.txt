Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Embolization of Bronchial Artery by Interventional Radiology
Endoscopic Gastrodeuodenoscopy by GI

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77 year old with PMH relevant for esophageal CA
s/p metal stent, who was in his usual state of health until he
was in church on day of admission when he felt the onset of
severe abdominal pain and dizzyness. He went home and had
hematemesis x 3. Of note, the patient has CAD and Afib and is
anticoagulated with an INR of 3.7 upon arrival. At triage, he
was found to have BP 122/69 and HR 73. He then continued to have
more emesis, amounting to about 2-5 liters of bright red blood.
He soon aspirated blood and was given etomidate and succinyl
choline for intubation as he could no longer protect his airway.
In the ED, proplex, 7 liters NS, 3 units FFP, 10 mg vitamin K
subQ, and 80 mg protonix with an additional drip were
adminstered. He was also given 3 units O+ blood while his own
was being crossmatched. A bear hugger was applied and he was
sent to the MICU for closer monitoring. Of note, upon arrival in
the ED, his HCT was 35.8 and after the first 3 units PRBCS it
was 26.8.
In the MICU, an EGD revealed a large clot and no active
bleeding. However, the mucosa was friable for 2 cm above the
stent and had tumor infiltrating the stent. He received another
3 units of PRBCs (for a total of 6), bringing his HCT to 30.

EKG: intermittent pacing spikes with V rate 78, normal axis, Q
waves V1-V3 (old) - unchanged
.
CXR: Endotracheal tube 5.8 cm from the carina, in appropriate
position. A nasogastric tube is seen with tip positioned in the
mid esophagus, just superior to the proximal aspect of a
metallic esophageal stent. Esophageal stent appears to extend
from the mid thoracic esophagus just above the gastroesophageal
junction. The heart is stable in size. The lungs are clear,
without evidence of effusions or focal consolidations. An ICD
device with biventricular pacing leads remains in place.
.
[**2160-12-23**] IR Embolization Procedure
IMPRESSION: No apparent extravasation from the left gastric
artery territory and no extension of the left gastric artery
into the high esophagus. Celiac artery stenosis with
collateralization through a hypertrophic gastroduodenal artery,
predominantly into the liver. No active extravasation.

Blush within the area of the esophagus at the upper level of the
stent compatible with granulation tissue or tumor. Also, blush
at the level of the right hilum which likely related to a lymph
node. Embolization of this territory via the peripheral right
bronchial artery with 100-300 micron and 500-700 micron
Embospheres to the level of stasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year old male with UGIB secondary to esophageal CA, who
expired after excessive hemmorhage.
.
1. UGIB: Bleeding secondary to esophageal CA whcih eroded into
esophageal. Stable on admission after reversal of coagulopathy
with Factor IX, vitamin K, and FFP. He had an EGD which showed
no active bleeding, but began bleeding actively on day 2 into
day 3 and had EGD which showed active bleeding from upper
esophagus. Taken urgently by IR for embolization procedure and
had bronchial artery embolized. Stable for day three but then
later in the day began to hemmorhage.
.
2. Esophageal CA: Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**]. Has T2 N0 lesion of
upper esophagus s/p stenting in [**11-22**]. There was a question of
possible radiation/chemo in the future. Also, he was scheduled
to have surgical intervention by thoracics in [**Month (only) **].
.
3. Respiratory: He was intubated for airway protection after
vomiting large amounts of blood and because he was thought to
have aspirated. Initially kept intubated for procedures, and
began to hemmorhage before he was weaned.
.
4. CAD: Admitted with home meds of plavix, atorvastatin,
enalapril, atenolol, lasix. He did not have any chest pain
during his stay.
.
5. Rhythm: He had a history of A fib abd was on coumadin for it.
He was also on digoxin and atenolol. We held these meds given
bleeding and hypotension. He had a pacemaker which we placed a
magnet over once he was made CMO.
.
6. Cardiomyopathy: He was euvolemic to dry on admission with EF
40% on ECHO in [**2158**].
.
His wife [**Name (NI) 233**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 63285**]) made him CMO after extensive
hemmorhage in the setting of advanced esophageal cancer.
