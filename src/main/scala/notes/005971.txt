Admission Date:  [**2112-10-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2112-11-4**]


Service:  THORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease and mitral
regurgitation requiring a coronary artery bypass graft and
mitral valve replacement in [**2110**] who had a complicated
recovery since the surgery with pneumonia and a history of
intubation and tracheostomy.  The patient was complaining of
progressive dyspnea since his recovery from the cardiac
surgery and was evaluated with a CAT scan in [**2111-7-13**] and
was found to have high tracheal stenosis at the level of the
thoracic inlet with the lumen approximately 7 mm in diameter.
However, the patient was hesitant in seeking help and finally
consulted Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of Interventional Pulmonology and
presents for a flexible bronchoscopy on the day of admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG and MVR in
[**2110**].
2.  History of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
3.  History of left atrial clot for which the patient has
been taking Coumadin.
4.  History of posterior circulation CVA.
5.  Obstructive sleep apnea requiring CPAP.
6.  History of hip fracture, status post surgical repair.
7.  History of fall with recent subdural hemorrhage which is
stable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for tobacco smoking.  He quit at
the age of 30.  Social alcohol consumption.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 5.4,
hematocrit 37.8, platelets 166,000.  PT/PTT 15.8/29.3, INR
1.7.  Chemistries revealed a sodium of 141, potassium 4.3,
chloride 105, C02 26, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9 with a glucose
of 115, calcium 9.3, magnesium 1.9, phosphate 3.3.

Pulmonary function testing done on [**2112-8-5**] with
moderate to restrictive impairment with decreased FVC and
FEV1 and normal FEV1/FVC.

Transthoracic echocardiogram done on [**2112-10-7**]
showed left atrium mildly dilated with an abnormal shadowing
echodensity in the posterior portion consistent with a clot,
moderate to severely reduced global left ventricular systolic
function with an ejection fraction of 20-25% consistent with
his history of MI, coronary artery disease, status post CABG.

Chest CT done on [**2112-10-5**] showed a small subdural hemorrhage
along the right tentorium, cerebellum, without mass affect,
small right frontal and parietal infarcted areas were noted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  The patient
was afebrile with a temperature of 96.7, heart rate 78, blood
pressure 120/64, respiratory rate 20, saturating at 96% on
room air.  General:  The patient was alert and oriented times
three, in no apparent distress.  The patient stridorous but
speaking.  HEENT:  Pupils were equally round and reactive to
light and accommodation with extraocular movements intact.
The oropharynx was clear without any lesions.  Neck:  Supple,
nontender, no bruits noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally with transmitted upper airway noise.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly/irregular heart rate, no audible
murmurs.  Abdomen:  Bowel sounds soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly appreciated.
Extremities:  No edema with good palpable dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII grossly
intact with intact motor and sensory systems in the
extremities grossly.  The rectal examination was Guaiac
negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy with Interventional Pulmonology and was found to
have severe obstruction at the proximal trachea and was
admitted for further observation and management.  Because of
his subtherapeutic anticoagulation, the patient was started
on a heparin drip with a goal to titrate up to PTT of 60-80.

Neurology consult was obtained.  A review of the head CT was
done.  There were no absolute contraindications to
anticoagulation from their point of view.  Cardiology consult
was also called for preoperative evaluation and it was felt
that there was no evidence of ongoing ischemia or severe
decompensation of heart failure at this time.  The patient
still has moderate to high risk of perioperative cardiac
event.  The patient was started on a beta blocker
preoperatively.

Because of the severe tracheal stenosis and danger of airway
obstruction, the patient was admitted to the MICU for
observation prior to surgery.  The patient was evaluated by
the Thoracic Surgery Service and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] as consulted by
Interventional Pulmonology and for possible surgical
intervention.  At the time, Mr. [**Known lastname 50980**] and his family said
that they did not want a tracheostomy nor did they want a T
tube and stated that he would prefer to die than to have
those procedures.  Therefore, the patient was recommended a
tracheal resection and reconstruction or a bronchoscopic
procedure.

After the risks of the surgery was fully explained and all
questions were answered and informed consent was obtained,
the patient was taken to the OR on [**2112-10-31**] for a
possible tracheal resection and reconstruction.  However,
this procedure was aborted due to the inability to establish
with any degree of certainty that the anastomosis would be
due without any undue tension.  The patient went ahead with
the alternative plan for a bronchoscopic approach and
underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with dilatation and stent of
the proximal tracheal stenosis on [**2112-10-31**] by
Interventional Pulmonology.

Postoperatively, the patient did relatively well.  On
postoperative day number one, the patient was complaining of
difficulty swallowing.  Given his prior history of CVA and
dysphagia, Speech and Swallow consult was called.  The
initial evaluation was that the patient did not demonstrate
any overt signs or symptoms of aspiration.  The patient went
ahead with a video swallow study.  On video swallow study,
the patient demonstrated aspiration with nectar-thick liquids
and thin liquids and the patient was initially placed on
n.p.o. status.

However, after an extensive discussion with the
Interventional Pulmonology Team and with the patient, it was
clear that this was not an acute process given his history of
CVA and his history of dysphagia and given the fact that the
patient was only a few days out from surgery that these
findings may be transiently related to postoperative
recovery.

With the patient's insistence on starting on a pureed diet
which he had been taking prior to admission and with full
understanding of risks of aspiration and pneumonia as
explained by the staff to the patient, the patient was
cautiously started on a pureed diet.  The patient tolerated a
pureed diet without signs or symptoms of aspiration.  The
patient was also started on Coumadin per his schedule and
continued on IV heparin and because his INR was not
therapeutic the patient was converted over to Lovenox
anticoagulation therapy at 70 mg subcutaneously q. 12 hours
for full anticoagulant effect while he continued his
anticoagulation with p.o. Coumadin at rehabilitation.  At
discharge, the patient's INR was 1.9.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to rehabilitation.
