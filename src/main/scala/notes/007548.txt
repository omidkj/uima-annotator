History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 25yo man with bipolar and polysubstance abuse who is a
bryerwood for heroin detox (on methadone).  He reports he was
using 50bags iv heroin daily, denied using anything else(but see
below).  Mother reports he started scratching himself after
girlfriend broke up with him.  Parents took him to ER.

.
He recalls feeling suicidal and going to [**Hospital1 **] but doesn't
know
how he got here or recall his hospitalization there. Per
[**Hospital1 **] nurse he was admitted 5 days ago for detox from
benzos and heroin and was becoming increasingly manic and
agitated. Last night he had a confrontation with another patient
and received stat IM meds after making a weapon with a tonic
bottle wrapped in a sock. Detox regiment was Valium and
methadone tapers. Total
methadone received 80mg. Yesterday received valium 5x3, Lithium
300bid, Lamictal 200bid, Stelazine 3mg in am/1mg pm, Vistaril
25am/50hs, Ativan 2x2 for agitation, stat IM
Ativan2/Zyprexa10/Benadryl50.  This morning pt. was confused,
didn't know where he was, ataxic.
.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Initial VS were 98, hr 118,
111/61, 16RR, 99%.  He punched a security guard.  In the ED he
had a negative head CT.  He received olanzipine 10mg IM x3, and
haldol 5mg/ativan 2mg. He had a psych consult who felt that he
medically not stable to evaluate but did sign a section 12.  He
had a toxicology consult.  They felt that he was "classically"
anticholenergic.  For now recommending to avoid anticholinergics
given anticholinergic toxidrome and agitatin and to use benzos
preferentially.  He received 2mg IV x3 in the ED.
?Physiostigmine?  Because of somnolence and 4 pt restraints he
was admitted to the ICU.
