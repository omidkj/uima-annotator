Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 48 F w/ massive metastatic breast CA obliterating the left
lung, causing a pulmonary effusion, which had become infected
and caused the patient to have increasing dyspnea.
.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 14893**] arrived at an OSH with dyspnea on [**8-6**] and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], as all of her care ans been here. In the
ED, chest CT showed mediastinal shift due to pts rapidly growing
L lung mass and effusion. Effusion was tapped - 300mL was taken
off. She also was shown to have a high white count and lactate
of 4.1. She was started on vanc and cefepime.
.
In the MICU, interventional pulmonology performed a second
thoracentesis, this time taking 1600cc's off. A pleurex device
was placed to allow for further drainage. As the effusion grew
GPCs, vanc and cefepine were d/c'd in favor of Unasyn. The
patient became dyspnic and wheezy after the thoracentesis and
was started on albuterol and atrovent, as well as Advair. On the
morning of [**8-8**], the pt had a procedure to unclot the pleurex
with tPa. She became dyspnic after the procedure as well as
tachycardic to the 130s. Her albuterol was initially held, then
changed to Xopenex. IP came and withdrew the fluid they had
infused, leading to improved sx's. The patient becomes
hypotensive after fluid drainage, the malignant pleural effusion
is rapidly accumulating and leads to decreased intravascular
volume. The plurax catheter is being drained Q6H to gravity
foley bag with one way valve. There is suspiciton of
post-obstructive PNA that is being treated with a `seven day
course of unasyn b/c of GPCs on pleural fluid gram stain.
Patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBC on 7.15. Echo showed
minimal pericard effusion and PHTN. Responsive to fluid. Being
transferred to Ct surgery in stable condition.

The pt stayed overnight on the floor in stable condition and was
discharged to hospice on [**8-10**].
