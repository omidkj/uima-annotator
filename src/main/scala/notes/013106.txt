Imaging:
CXR - As compared to the previous examination, there is no
relevant change.
Moderate hyperinflation with sparse apical parenchymal
structure, suggestive
of pulmonary emphysema. Subpleural scar in the right upper lobe
that projects
over the posterior aspect of the sixth rib. There is no evidence
of newly
occurred focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax, no
pleural effusion.
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
.
CT sinuses -
The paranasal sinuses are essentially clear. No fluid levels are
seen. The
ostiomeatal units are patent. The nasal septum is intact.
Bilateral cataract
surgeries are noted.
IMPRESSION: No evidence for sinusitis.
.
KUB -
FINDINGS: There is massive fecal loading predominantly on the
left side of
the colon. The visualized bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
There is no
intraperitoneal free air noted. The visualized osseous and soft
tissue
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Massive left-sided fecal loading. No obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o F with COPD, HTN, hx of lung cancer and bipolar disease
with 2 days of SOB and significantly elevated BPs was admitted
to the floor for management of blood pressure.  Was found to be
in afib with RVR and responded with 6 second pause when
administered beta blocker.  Tachy brady arrhythmia diagnosed and
all nodal agents were stopped.  Pt continued to have high BPs
and it was difficult to manage due to the limitation of agents
we could use.  Pt BP seemed to correlate well with anxiety.  Pt
also had face and belly pain that were likely due to a deviated
septum and constipation respectively.
.
#  Hypertensive urgency - Pt presented with SBPs in 200s, which
remained elevated despite nitro and hydralazine in the ED.  BPs
eventually decreased after treatment in the ED.  Upon
presentation to the floor, took off the nitro pastes because
SBPs was in the 140s.  Restarted verapamil tonight.  Had one
more dose of verapamil this morning.  During the day had
bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia into the low 40s while she was
sleeping.  EKG had U waves, likely from nodal disease unable to
tolerate the CCB.  Was transfered to CCU for tachy-brady
arrhythmia-see below.  High BPs brought down with hydralazine
and nitro paste, ativan and morphine.  Currently on losartan,
clonidine patch and imdur - increased imdur from 60 to 90 mg
several days ago.  Seems controlled when patient is calm,
continues to also spikes early in the morning before AM labs.
.
# Arrythmia - transferred to CCU after an episode of afib with
rvr and then a 6 second pause after a 5 mg dose of metoprolol.
Pt has tachy-brady syndrome.  Cards and EP were consulted, pt
decided against PPM.  No nodal agents.  Transferred a second
time for afib with RVR, stabablized in CCU and now back on
floor.  No nodal agents.  Will readdress pacemaker as
outpatient.
.
# Psych - hx of bipolar disease.  Consulted -they recommend
increasing seroquel to 125 mg qHS for increased agitation as
well as 25 mg seroquel PRN, no more ativan, although patient
responds well to ativan and was used when PRN seroquel did not
help relax her. They think she is decisional and not manic, no
other changes.
.
# SOB - has resolved since presentation.  History of COPD.  SOB
likely here related to hypertension rather than COPD
exaccerbation, considering symptom improvement when BP went
down.  Also complains of shortness of breath, "can't breath,"
because she is allergic to air conditioning.  She has facial
pain and nose pain and wears a mask to avoid the air
conditioning.  ENT was consulted to evalute pain and symptoms to
make sure we were not possibly missing a polyp/malignancy.  She
has a deviated septum but no other lesions.  CT of sinuses were
negative for sinusitis.
.
#  Abd pain /Constipation - resolved by passing gas.  Had recent
CT scan in [**Month (only) **] for [**Month (only) 1676**] distention and was negative for
pertinent pathology.  Used aggressive bowel regimen.  KUB showed
big ball of stool in R colon, bowel regiment relieved pain
occassionally.  In talking to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1676**] pain ha
