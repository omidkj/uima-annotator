Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis

interventional bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
70 yo F with SCLC, DMII/HTN/Hyperlipidemia, afib on coumadin,
ESRD 2' previous cisplatin therapy, p/w with SOB. She started
having SOB on exertion gradually over past week. She came to get
her Neulasta today and was found to be SOB and so referred to ED
for evaluation. Of note, she also had some chest discomfort with
SOB during HD today.
She has a has large pleural effusion which was planned to be
tapped as outpt yesterday but was deferred [**2-18**] high INR. She
denies any fever/chills, cough, palpitations. She occassionaly
has some phlegm. She uses O2 at home at 2L for COPD (baseline O2
sat 90-95) and this has been stable for her.
.
ED:
- CXR showed effusion/mass
- CTA Chest: no PE, mod R pleural effusion, narrowing of SVC by
mass
- IP was made aware who recommended admission for tapping by
them

.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Small amount of pericardial
fluid is again seen. Otherwise, pericardium is unremarkable.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Again demonstrated is a right upper lobe mass and associated
consolidation, encasing the right mainstem bronchus, right main
pulmonary artery and right-sided pulmonary veins. There is an
associated moderate- sized pleural effusion, with fluid tracking
medially and into the fissure on occasion. The overall findings
are largely unchanged from [**2141-5-5**]. Mild centrilobular
emphysema is present. The left lung is grossly clear without
pleural effusion. The SVC appears to be mildly narrowed, with
prominent collaterals, similar in appearance to prior study.
Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal a rounded hypodensity
within the mid pole of the left kidney, incompletely
characterized.
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a stable compression fracture of
the upper thoracic spine. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions are identified. There is generalized edema within the
subcutaneous tissues, compatible with anasarca. There is a
slightly sclerotic right third rib, similar in appearance to
recent PET-CT.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
2. Stable right hilar and upper lobe consolidation/mass.
Moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right, unchanged. Tiny
amount of pericardial fluid. Mildly narrowed SVC, with prominent
collaterals.
.
U/S: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the left upper
extremity.
.
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: A tunneled dual chamber large bore
dialysis catheter enters the right internal jugular vein and
terminates in the right atrium. Immediately superior to the
confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein in the right
brachiocephalic vein is a segment of marked narrowing/stenosis
of the right brachiocephalic vein at which point there is no
contrast about the catheter and redirection of contrast via
multiple chest wall collaterals including collateralization of
surface hepatic vessels via intramammary veins onsistent with
hemodynamically significant alternation of normal venous flow.
Narrowing of the right subclavian vein at the thoracic outlet is
likely not as contributory. Although there is a significant
conglomerate of tumor, hilar adenopathy, and consolidated lung
that extends from the right hilum into the right apex
obliterating the right upper, markedly compressing the right
middle, and narrowing the right lower lobe bronchi (all of which
unchanged in the short interval), the SVC distends normally and
the stenosis described seems confined to the distal right
brachiocephalic vein. The heart and great vessels of the
mediastinum are otherwise unchanged.   The small right effusion
is changed in distribution but not in size and there is no
pericardial effusion. The left lung is clear aside from trace
atelectasis. No suspicious lesions are identified in the spine.

IMPRESSION: Suspected stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein
immediately superior to the left brachiocephalic confluence, due
to the indwelling catheter, less likely tumor compression as the
SVC itself distends normally. Appearance of the right upper lobe
mass, adenopathy, and consolidation is unchanged.
.
IR guided venogram:
1) venograms demonstrated patent bilateral internal jugular and
brachiocephalic veins.
2) Small filling defects in the superior vena cava (catheter-
related
clot/fibrin sheath). No evidence of SVC stenosis.
3) Successful exchange for a new tunneled 23- cm cuff- to- tip
14 French
double- lumen dialysis catheter, with the tip positioned in the
right atrium. The line is ready for use.
.
CXR [**7-4**]: There is no change in the known right upper lobe
consolidation and atelectasis. No change compared to the prior
studies. There is interval increase in the right pleural
effusion, current to moderate. The left lung is unremarkable
within the limitation of the chest radiograph. The double-lumen
catheter inserted through right subclavian approach terminates
in mid distal SVC. There is no pneumothorax.
.
PORTABLE SUPINE ABDOMEN, ONE VIEW: Retained contrast is seen
throughout the entire colon, which appears unremarkable. There
are no dilated loops of bowel. There is no supine evidence for
free intraperitoneal air or
pneumatosis.
