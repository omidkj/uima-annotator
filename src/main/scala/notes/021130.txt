Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of AF on coumadin, systolic
HF, diverticulosis, and internal hemorrhoids who presents with
complaints of LGIB.
.
# BRBPR: In the ER patient received 10 mg of vitamin K for an
INR of 2.6. Due to concern of acute bleed patient was admitted
to ICU, but transferred to the general medicine floor when found
to be hemodynamically stable. Sigmoidoscopy demonstrated a
significant amount of old blood, but no acute bleed. Source felt
to be extensive diverticular disease. On admission patient's HCT
dropped 5 points (from 34.7 -> 29.8), however remained stable at
28-30 throughout the remainder of admission and upon discharge.
Patient required no blood transfusions and was hemodynamically
stable throughout her hospital course. On discharge she
continued to have dark, loose, guaiac positive stool which was
felt to be old blood (HCT and hemodynamics stable). Patient is
on coumadin for A Fib and ASA + dipyridamole for TIA - all three
were held throughout admission.
- Continue to hold coumadin, ASA, dipyridamole for 1 week
following discharge. Re-start following 1 week, but patient
needs to follow-up with pcp, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17143**], regarding continuation
of all three anti-coagulents.
- Check HCT twice a week
.
# Atrial fibrillation: status post AVJ ablation w/ PPM. On
coumadin as an outpatient. INR was reversed on admission due to
concern of acute bleed (see above).
- Continue to hold coumadin 1 week following discharge. Re-start
following 1 week, but patient needs to follow-up with pcp, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 17143**], regarding continuation of all three anti-coagulents.
.
# Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient currently euvolemic on exam.
B-blocker and diuretics held briefly in setting of acute bleed.
Metoprolol 100 mg TID and diuretics re-started prior to
discharge.
.
# Hx of CVA: Dipyradiole and ASA as outpatient suggest history
of TIA or small vessel disease.
- Continue to hold ASA, dipyridamole for 1 week following
discharge. Re-start following 1 week, but patient needs to
follow-up with pcp, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 17143**], regarding continuation of all
three anti-coagulatents.
.
# FEN: Tolerating regular diet prior to discharge.
