Service:  TRAUMA SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 27-year-old male,
status post gunshot wound to the head.  Reportedly no loss of
consciousness at the scene.  Taken to an outside hospital
hemodynamically stable.  While he was in the ED, he was
increasingly agitated, so was intubated for his own safety.
At the outside hospital, head CT showed an occipital cortex
trajectory of the bullet from left-to-right with swelling
along the tract.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] via LifeFlight
hemodynamically stable throughout the flight.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

VITALS SIGNS:  GCS - patient was intubated, sedated and
paralyzed on presentation, temperature 97.2, blood pressure
128/72, pulse 79, respirations 16, O2 sat 100%.  Pupils were
2 mm and sluggish to react equally on both sides. There was
an entry wound on the left occipital area of the skull
approximately 5 mm with surrounding edema, and an exit wound
on the right occipital area.  Neck - trachea was midline with
no crepitus.  Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen soft, nontender.  Rectal
exam - normal tone, guaiac negative, no gross blood.
Extremities - no deformities or injuries seen.  Back without
any wounds or stepoffs.  Neuro - unable to assess at the
time.

LABS:  The patient had an initial white count of 19.7,
initial hematocrit 38.8 down from 43.7.  His coags were
normal.  A blood gas was done - pH 7.35, CO2 42, O2 300,
bicarb 24, base deficit -2.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray was negative.  Pelvis was negative
for fracture.  A spine CT was done showing no fracture.  A
head CT was done which showed disrupture of the occipital
lobe bilaterally with a bullet tract going
through-and-through the occiput, and multiple bone fragments
in the cortex bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was kept intubated and on
propofol until hospital day #2, at which time the sedation
was decreased, and the patient was able to be extubated at
that time.  Neurosurgery completed their evaluation, and
determined that no other intervention was necessary except
for primary closure of the wounds bilaterally.  It was also
determined at that time, when the patient's sedation was
removed, that he was completely blind.  Per the neurosurgery
evaluation this was consistent with cortical blindness from
the occipital injury due to the bullet wound.  Neurosurgery
continued to follow the patient throughout his hospital stay.

The patient's neurologic status did improve over the course
of the hospital stay to the point at which he was alert and
oriented, however slightly sedated even without medication.
His mental status was felt to be primarily due to a
culmination of the direct injury to the brain, as well as the
coping with the initial injury and will be followed over
time, has improved throughout the course of the hospital
stay, and will be assessed on follow-up evaluations, as well
as with head CTs.

The patient was also kept on oxacillin for prophylactic
treatment of any infections that might result from a bullet
wound directly through the brain matter.  The patient did
initially have some signs of possible infection with the
white count over 20, and some fevers on hospital day #1 and
#2.  However, this was felt to be primarily due to the acute
traumatic event.  The patient did defervesce with no further
fevers after hospital day #3.  For the remainder of the
hospital course, he was afebrile with a white count trending
down.  There were no other signs of infection, and as the
patient's mental status improved, it was felt that it was
unlikely to be related to any possibility of emerging
encephalitis, or other infection.  The patient was, however,
kept on dicloxacillin for two weeks after discharge.

The patient also received a consult by neurorehabilitation.
After seeing the patient, they concluded that the patient
would benefit from registry with the [**State 350**] Commission
for the Blind and would need a blind rehab program.  They
recommended a short inpatient stay for safety, mobility and
assistive devices that may be beneficial for him.  The
patient will also receive outpatient follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] from neurorehabilitation.

Ophthalmology was consulted for blindness.  They did confirm
cortical blindness and helped complete the paperwork which
will allow the patient to be set-up with the [**State 350**]
Commission for the Blind.

Occupational Therapy also was consulted on this patient for
the purposes of increasing his ability to function with the
new cortical blindness.  They continued therapy throughout
the hospital stay and eventually recommended home
occupational therapy versus 24-hour monitoring, and follow-up
for vision retraining.

The final consult that was obtained was by ENT which was
obtained because the patient was complaining of right and
left-sided ear pressure and pain.  This was a new complaint
that came-up on hospital day #4.  The patient denied having
any hearing loss, but noted the pressure bilaterally and the
pain was greater on the right than the left.  Following the
ENT evaluation, they managed to clear-out some of the debris
from the left ear and recommended Floxin drops to the left
ear, as well as water precautions to the ears bilaterally.
In addition, they recommended a hearing test as an
outpatient, as well as potential for OMFS to evaluate the
temporomandibular joint which could contribute to the ear
pain by causing referred otalgia.  In the end, it was felt
that there was no trauma near the temporomandibular joint,
and that the patient when he receives follow-up with ENT can
have this further evaluated, and that it was unnecessary to
repeat or to perform films of the temporomandibular joint or
obtain OMFS evaluation while an inpatient.  We will consider
this in follow-up appointments to determine whether or not
the patient needs further studies done of the face and the
temporomandibular joint, or an OMFS follow-up.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Gunshot wound through the occipital lobe of the brain.
2. Cortical blindness.
3. Asthma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Acetaminophen 325 mg 1-2 tablets po q 4-6 h as needed.
2. Ciprofloxacin drops 10 drops to the left ear [**Hospital1 **].
3. Hydromorphone 2 mg po q 4-6 h prn pain.
4. Dicloxacillin 500 mg po qid x 14 days.
5. Metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
6. Phenytoin 100 mg po q 8 h.

FOLLOW-UP:
1. Trauma Clinic in 2 weeks.
2. Neurosurgery to have sutures removed in 7 days.
3. Neurosurgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in 2 weeks with the CAT scan
prior to follow-up.
4. ENT for audiology and further evaluation.
5. Referral to [**State 350**] Commission for the Blind which
will be contacting the patient to provide for likely
inpatient rehabilitation.
