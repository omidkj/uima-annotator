History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 85524**] is a 27 yo male with PMH of bipolar disorder,
narcotics addiction on methadone, remote motorcycle accident
with resulting seizure disorder on dilantin until 6 months ago,
who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on one week ago in respiratory
failure.  He initially had a sore throat but then developed
productive cough, DOE, which was followed by fever and then
respiratory distress.
.
In the ED there, they felt he was septic and he was intubated.
He had large bilateral consolidations and sputum grew group A
strep and strep pneumoniae.  A CT chest without contrast on [**6-15**]
showed confluent consolidation with associated air bronchogram
involving both lower lobes and there is also involvement of the
middle lobe with patchyinfiltrate in the upper lobes, pleural
fluid on the right and left.  He was on norepinephrine for BP
support which was weaned on the days following admission as he
received aggressive IV hydration.  He received a dose of IVIG
because of his history of splenectomy and was placed on
quadruple antibiotics with levoquin, clindamycin, ceftriaxone,
and vanc until the speciation and sensitivities returned, at
which time he was placed on ceftriaxone for a planned 14 day
course.  Legionella urinary antigen also returned negative so
his levofloxacin was stopped.  An HIV test was reportedly
negative.  HCV was positive.  He required large doses of
fentanyl and versed to remain comfortable on the vent and
remained on his home methadone.  On Thursday, he was extubated.
He has been afebrile since [**6-21**] and his O2 sat has been in the
mid 90s on [**7-7**] liters.
.
His MS was noted to be off and he had a reported seizure on
Saturday described as his eyes rolling back into his head with a
short episode of LOC.  He was started on dilantin 100mg TID.
Since then, his physician describes episodes where his eyes will
roll back in his head and he will have tremors, but he will come
out of it if he is spoken to.  A CT head was normal over the
weekend.  For that reason, he is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  He
is currently on 10L O2, but there has not been much effort to
wean his O2.
.
His WBC prior to transfer was 23 with 51 neutrophils, 10 bands,
15 lymphs, HCT 35.5.
.
.
On the floor, he is tachycardic, alert but only intermittently
following commands.  He can not give a history because he is not
talking.

[**2139-6-26**] PA&Lat CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Right PICC in satisfactory position with tip in mid SVC.
2. Left lower lobe opacification and small left effusion most
compatible with
pneumonia.

[**2139-6-22**] ECG: Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Diffuse T
wave changes that are non-specific. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

[**2139-6-23**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton
activations; however, it captured several events suggestive of
ongoing seizure activity bifrontally with a left predominance
which became much less frequent in the second half of the
recording. There were several sharp waves seen in the left
temporal area suggestive of increased irritability in this
region. The background activity improved substantially over the
time of the recording suggestive of a resolving mild to moderate
encephalopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 85524**] is a 27 yo male with PMH of seizure disorder [**3-3**]
head trauma, narcotic addiction, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 6591**] for further management of seizures and altered mental
status following a group A strep/strep pneumo pna requiring
intubation.
.
# respiratory failure: respiratory failure in the setting of
group A strep and strep pneumo pna.  He was extubated on [**6-18**]
still required 10L O2 by NC on transfer, though little previous
attempt was made to wean.  Severe strep pneumo pna is uncommon
in healthy 27 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] underlying immunocompromise may be
considered, but he also grew group A strep which can cause a
severe pna in young immunocompetent individuals.  He was HIV
negative during his OSH stay. Continued ceftriaxone during his
micu stay, and fever curve decreased. His O2 was progressively
weaned down as his mental status improved, but he did require
occasional aggressive chest PT to mobilize secretions.  He was
weaned to room air and was able to ambulate without supplemental
oxygen. He completed a 2 week course of IV ceftriaxone after a
PICC was placed.  The PICC was removed prior to discharge.
.
# MS changes/seizure: Reported seizure at OSH 2 days prior to
transfer, was started on dilantin.  He has a history of a
seizure disorder [**3-3**] head trauma from motocycle accident. He
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with markedly dilated pupils, decreased
interraction and intermittent command following, hyperreflexia
with LE clonus, very concerning for acute withdrawal state, with
possible intermittent seizures. He had been getting large doses
of versed and fentanyl while intubated at OSH (up to
40mg/400mcg/hr!, and his home methadone has been reduced
recently. Neuro and psychiatry were consulted and agreed with
withdrawal picture. His methadone dose was doubled, and he was
put on standing ativan and clonidine. He was also loaded with
dilantin (low levels here) and monitored on EEGs, which were
reported are markedly encephalopathic with possible intermittent
seizures. Over his MICU course h
