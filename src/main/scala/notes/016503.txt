IMAGING:
--------------------
MRI HEAD [**4-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneously enhancing multiloculated dural-based
extra-axial right
frontotemporal mass with mass effect on the right lateral
ventricle, slight
right uncal herniation, marked surrounding vasogenic edema, and
leftward shift of the normally midline structures. Differential
diagnosis includes an atypical meningioma, or
hemangiopericytoma.
2. No acute infarction or hemorrhage. No additional enhancing
lesions are
identified.

CTA HEAD [**4-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right frontotemporal heterogeneously enhancing
extra-axial
dural-based mass with mass effect, surrounding vasogenic edema,
and
approximately 1.5 cm shift of the normally midline structures.
The
differential diagnosis includes an atypical meningioma, or
hemangiopericytoma.
2. No acute territorial infarction or hemorrhage.Vascular
displacement by
mass.

CT HEAD [**4-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval mild increase in effacement of cerebral sulci
bilaterally and
decreased differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter, likely
representing a
component of cerebral edema. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
2. Stable amount of blood and mass effect at the surgical site.
3. Severely increased subcutaneous edema in the left frontal
scalp extending to the periorbital area.

IMPRESSION:
Status post right frontotemporal craniotomy and removal of large
right
extraaxial mass with a postoperative small amount of extraaxial
and
intraparenchymal bleed and 1.6 cm of midline shift towards the
left.

MRI Head [**4-16**]:
1. Infarction of the right frontal lobe adjacent to the surgical
cavity.
2. Possible residual tumor enhancement, most pronounced at the
right temporal lobe.
3. Post-surgical changes after craniotomy with a fluid-filled
surgical
cavity, as well as blood products surrounding the surgical
cavity and small left subdural pneumocephalus.
4. Compared to the CT earlier from the day, unchanged, about 1.5
cm shift of normally midline structures to the left with
subfalcine herniation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the NSURG service after transfer from OSH
for definitive care for newly identified brain mass. On
admission, he was sent for MRI of the head, and CTA of the head
for further evaluation and surgical planning. Due to the size of
the lesion; it was decided to take him to the OR on [**4-14**] to
resect the mass and obtain diagnosis to guide treatment.
Pre-operatively, due to his extensive cardiac history, a
cardiology consult was obtained. They recommended the addition
of a beta blocker(which was done), and did not recommend
continuing the plavix post-operatively as his stending procedure
was completed greater than one year prior. They did however,
recommend restarting aspirin as soon as it was safe for us to do
so. Post-operativley, he was returned to the SICU for q1h
neurochecks and diligent system monitoring. After an uneventful
night of monitoring, he was OOB with Physical therapy. His Blood
pressure was kept under strict control under 140mmHg.

On post op day 3 he had an improving neurological exam, and was
transferred out of the unit to the step down floor. The patient
was evaluated by physical therapy and he was deemed an
appropriate candidate for rehab. He was discharged to a rehab
facility on [**2151-4-19**].
