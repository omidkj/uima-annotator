Brief Hospital Course:
63 y/o female presented with fevers, cough, bandemia, fluid
responsive hypotension, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia.  Pt
was initially admitted to the MICU for management of
hypotension.  review of OSH records shws that pt has had
persistent fevers of unknown origin for 8 months, and diffuse
lymphadenopathy.
.
1. Castleman's syndrome: See below.  Diagnosis by lymph node
biopsy.  HIV ab negative
Heme/onc in discussion with patient deferred inpatient treatment
given rapid clinical improvement.  Has follow up with heme/onc
for decision on treatement
.
2. Fever with Bandemia/Aspiration Pneumonia: Bandemia resolved
after first hospital day.  Blood cultures NGTD.  Sputum culture
NGTD, with AFB negative x3.  Urine culture NGTD.  Initially
treated empirically for PNA with Levo/Tamiflu.  Influenza A and
B negative so tamiflu d/ced.  Pt subsequently developed
increasing fevers with RUL opacity after intubation for inguinal
LN biopsy.  Abx changed to vanc and zosyn and patient
defervesced.  ID has recommended an extensive workup with serum
assays, some of which are still pending at discharge.  Repeat
CXR did not show clear evidence of infiltrate.  Serum EBV showed
IgG positive and titer of 400.
Treated with 7 days of vanc/zosyn for aspiration pneumonia,
defervesced, clinically much improved by discharge.  Toxo, EBV,
CMV all IGG positive, IGM negative.
-
3. Pancytopenia: Posible etiologies include lymphoma with marrow
suppression, infection with marrow suppression and ITP.  Pt had
LN biopsy and BMBx to further evaluate.  Heme/onc and ID are
follwed throughout.  Pt required multiple plt transfusions due
to continued oozing from central line site and BMBx site.
Because of the need for multiple plt transfusions, she had HLA
typing.  Results showed: A34, A68, B35, B58, CW4, and CW7.  A68
is highly reactive with A2 and in future plt transfusions A2
Donor plts should be avoided.  No schistocytes on peripheral
smear and Hemolysis labs negative.  Stool for occult blood
negative.  Anemia likely secondary to marrow supression.  Also
had continuous oozing form central line site, significant
hematuria, and significant blood loss from BMBx site. Transfused
two units for crit of 20 on [**1-1**].  Appropriate bump to 28.
All cell lines stabilized for rest of hospitalization, trouble
with platelet clumping throughout.  Hematology reviewed smeasrs
multiple times.  [**Month (only) 116**] be related to Castleman's or have been from
critical illness/infection.  Platelets 180,000 by discharge.
.
4 Lymphadenopathy: Pt has CT thorax with diffuse LAD with broad
infectious DDx vs. possibility of lymphoma.  Lymph node biopsy
came back positive for Multicentric Castleman's disease. HIV ab
negative, vl pending at time of discahrge.  WIll follow up with
heme/onc.
.
#. Hypotension: Fluid responsive and resolved since first day of
admission.  Most likely etiology is decreased PO intake with an
element of sepsis.
.
#. Hyponatremia: resolved with NS, likely hypovolemic
hyponatremia.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation
during bone marrow biopsy.  Was slightly difficult to wean her
off the ventilator due to hypoxia.  After extubation, patient
was quickly weaned off oxygen and had high O2 sats on room air.
She did have a persistent cough and sore throat.

also continued on PPI for GERD and albuterol for asthma history.

Discharge Instructions:
Take all mediations as prescribed.  We have made no changes to
your medications.

Follow up as below.  You have been diagnosed with a serious
