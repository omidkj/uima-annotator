LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC DATA:  The patient's labs on
[**2162-9-14**] were as follows, white blood cell count of 11.9,
hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit 41.1, platelets 206, sodium 140,
potassium 3.9, chloride 107, bicarbonate 26, BUN 17,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 116, AST was 65, ALT 33, total
bilirubin 0.2, alkaline phosphatase 79, LDH 226, CPK 863, CK-
MB 85, and troponin T 2.38.  His PT was 13.3, PTT 33.7, and
INR 1.1.  His UA was negative.  Chest x-ray on [**2162-9-15**]
showed heart normal in size with tortuous aorta.  No vascular
congestion, consolidations, or effusions, probable segmental
atelectasis in one or both lungs.  The patient's EKG on
[**2162-9-14**] was as follows, heart rate of 60 and in normal sinus
rhythm, prior inferior myocardial infarction compared to the
previous tracing.  Repeat prior inferior myocardial
infarction, ST-segment elevation on leads II, III, aVF, and
V4 to V6, T waves in the upper leads, which may represent
pseudonormalization.  Echocardiogram on [**2162-9-14**], mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal inferior septum, distal septum, and
main inferior lateral walls.  The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened but not stenotic.  There is no aortic
regurgitation.  The mitral valve appears structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse.  Ascending aorta measures
3.7 cm.  Left ventricular ejection fraction is 40 percent.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2162-9-14**] revealed left main
disease and 3-vessel coronary artery disease along with acute
inferior myocardial infarction.  The left main coronary
artery had a 60 to 70 percent distal lesion.  Left circumflex
was a large vessel with an eccentric 90 percent stenosis
before a large OM1 and OM2.  Right coronary artery had a 100
percent thrombotic occlusion.  There are 5 prior patent
stents with diffuse 50% instant restenosis.  Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **].
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] consulted this patient on [**2162-9-14**] after the
echocardiogram and catheterization.  The patient preferred to
come back for surgery after a week or 2, and he was
discharged from the hospital.  On [**2162-9-15**], the patient was
still in the hospital, and he changed his mind and decided to
have the surgery done.  The patient was preop'd for surgery
on [**2162-9-16**].  On [**2162-9-16**], the patient was brought in to the
operating room, he received coronary artery bypass graft
times 3.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, heart rate of 62, normal
sinus rhythm, respiratory rate of 16, BP of 137/82, and
weight of 82 kg.  His conjunctivae were nonicteric.
Extraocular movements were intact.  Pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light.  Jugular veins were nondistended.
Neck was supple.  No thyromegaly.  No lymphadenopathy.  His
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart had
regular rate and rhythm with S1 and S2.  No murmurs.  His
abdomen was positive for bowel sounds, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No
focal deficits.  Carotids were 2 plus with no bruits
bilaterally.  Extremities were nonedematous with DP pulses of
1 plus and PT pulses of 2 plus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2162-9-16**], the patient went to operating
room for procedure of coronary artery bypass graft times 3,
left internal mammary artery to LAD, saphenous vein graft to
OM, and saphenous vein graft to PDA.  Cardiopulmonary bypass
time was 88 minutes and cross-clamp time was 46 minutes.  The
patient was transferred to cardiac ICU in stable condition
with a heart rate of 87 per minute, atrial paced.  He was on
nitroglycerin 1 mcg per kg per minute, propofol being
titrated, aprotinin 25 cc per hour.

Postoperative day 1, the patient was hemodynamically stable
with a heart rate of 91, normal sinus, blood pressure of
110/63.  He was on metoprolol at 12.5 mg and on antibiotic
vancomycin.  His physical exam was unremarkable.  He was also
on Lasix and his Swan was discontinued.  The patient was
weaned from mechanical ventilation on [**2162-9-17**] and overnight,

hematocrit 30.6, and platelets 225.  His glucose was 119,
potassium 3.2, and BUN and creatinine were 11 and 0.7.  The
patient was discharged to Far 2 from the cardiac surgery ICU.

On postoperative day 4, the patient was transferred to Far 2.
He was hemodynamically stable.  Pulse rate of 96, BP of
