History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 108328**] is an 82 year old female with MDS, Crohn's disease,
CAD s/p NSTEMI, CRI, h/o DVT with saddle embolus on weekly
lovenox due to h/o GIBs, h/o breast cancer, on home O2 who
presents with dyspnea, AMS. Of note, patient was discharged 6
days ago with left upper extremity DVT from PICC and subsequent
port placement.
.
In ED, patient presented solmnolent with marked tachypnea from
ambulance. ABG 7.21/80/76 given baseline pCO2 60 patient was
started on BiPAP. CXR with effusions, but unclear if any
consolidation. Mildly positive UA, minimal urine output. Patient
was started on Vanc/Zosyn and given methylpred 125mg
empirically. Patient with troponin at baseline. K noted to be
7.0: 60 gm kayexelate enema (with no significant bowel
movement), amp D50, 10 unit insulin iv, albuterol/ipratropium
nebs, and 1 gm calcium gluconate. EKG no peaked Ts, QRS 130
which is baseline and no other concerning ST/T changes. Patient
repeat K pending. Renal aware of K+ but given EKG felt no need
for urgent HD. Given recent left upper extremity DVT, patient
got 60 mg lovenox in ED as has not gotten today. Unable to get
PE CTA given renal failure. Minimal improvement on BiPAP in
terms of mental status. Current vitals: temp afebrile by rectal,
BP 140/40s, HR 50s, O2sat 97% on bipap 8/5, 2LNC.
.
Event prior to transfer: SBP 70s suddenly, and SBP improved 100s
off BiPAP, still sinus brady. Patient slightly more awake now
off BiPAP, getting 500 ml bolus. ABG just prior 7.27/68/74.
.
Upon arrival to MICU, patient somnulent off BiPAP. Patient
placed back on BiPAP and want unable to answer questions.
Daughter provided the following history. Daughter reports since
discharge from hospital patient has been weak, not interested in
eating, and intermittently very somnulent. Daughter reports her
mother is [**Name2 (NI) 18248**] and then not confused. [**Name2 (NI) 108329**] describes 2
episodes of confusion this week in the setting of document
hypoxia to 70s, that resolved upon increasing oxygen. Daughter
reports mother [**Name (NI) **] hot w/o fever by thermometer, and w/o chills.
Over the week the daughter has noted she issues with oxygenation
and has changed her O2 between 1.5 to 3LNC. Usually her mother
is only on O2 at night, but has been on it continuously since
just prior to last hospitalization. Daughter has been giving her
Bactrim and vitamins to help. She also gave her mother [**Doctor Last Name **]
yesterday, because she wanted her to retain water and was
concerned she was becoming dehydrated. Daughter reports
increased UOP earlier in the week followed by minimal urine
output today. Early on day of admission patient called out to
daughter and reports not seeing well and wanting to get out of
bed. Per daughter, these are symptoms of hypercarbia in her
mother. Daughter also report mother has had non-productive
cough, but without coughing after eating. Per daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **]
check was K =5.3 from VNA labs.
.
Review of systems:  (+) Per HPI. Daughter reports ongoing groin
rash.

Micro:
[**2194-8-24**] Blood cultures: pending
[**2194-8-24**] Urine culture: URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
.
Other Studies:
[**2194-8-24**] EKG: Possible wandering atrial pacemaker or irregular
sinus bradycardia with premature atrial contractions and first
degree A-V block. Right bundle-branch block. Non-specific ST-T
wave changes. Compared to tracing #1 no significant change.
[**2194-8-24**] CXR: 1. Moderate left and small right pleural effusions.

2. Left retrocardiac opacity, atelectasis and/or consolidation.
[**2194-8-24**] CT Head w/o: No acute intracranial pathology. Stable
encephalomalacic changes as described. However, MRI would be
more sensitive for [**Month/Day/Year 2742**] of acute infarct if clinical
concern warrants.
[**2194-8-25**] Echo: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2194-4-8**], the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now lower. The right ventricular
cavity is also smaller/now normal.
[**2194-8-25**] Left arm U/S: 1. Deep vein thrombosis is identified in
one of the two brachial veins. Flow within the axillary vein
appears to be normal on today's exam. 2. Stable appearing
hematoma in the left upper arm.
[**2194-8-26**] CXR: The Port-A-Cath catheter tip is in superior SVC.
The left retrocardiac consolidation which is most likely a
combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion is unchanged.
Infectious superimposed process cannot be excluded.  There is
interval worsening of [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] engorgement with currently
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] engorgement seen in the perihilar areas bilateral.
There is no pneumothorax.  The patient is after cholecystectomy




Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 year old female with MDS, Crohn's with multiple GI
bleeds, CAD s/p NSTEMI, CKD, h/o DVT/saddle embolus on daily
Lovenox, breast ca, on home O2 only at night secondary to
non-compliance with bipap, admitted for altered mental status
and dyspnea.

#. AMS.  The patient was admitted to the MICU with lethargy and
confusion which the daughter felt was due to hypercarbia.  Upon
arrival to MICU, the patient was somnolent off BiPAP and
improved after being placed back on BiPAP.  Ever since her last
admission, the dau
