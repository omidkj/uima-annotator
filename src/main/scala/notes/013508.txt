Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
-No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
-No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
-No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
-Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%), with no segmental wall
motion abnormalities.
-There are complex (>4mm) and simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There are complex & simple atheroma in the
aortic arch.
-There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate
([**1-22**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
-The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened, with severe
mitral annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
-There is no pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is AV paced on low dose phenylephrine infusion.
There is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position. There is appropriate leaflet excursion. There is no
AI. Gradients across aortic valve are appropriate. The mitral
valve regurgitation is unchanged vs slightly worsened from
prebypass exam. Biventricular function is maintained. The aorta
remains intact.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of the results at the time of each
study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2119-10-10**] where
the patient underwent Aortic Valve replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  She
remained in CVICU one day for pulmonary toilet and diuresis.
She does have an aspirin allergy, and will take Plavix instead.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor on POD 2 for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.
By the time of discharge on POD#5 the patient was ambulating
with assist,she needs continued diuretic therapy, her wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  Her
discharge cxr showed left pleural effusion has improved. The
patient was discharged to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 1474**]  in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
