Note:  This discharge summary will briefly summarize the
patient's extensive Intensive Care Unit course.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year old
female with a history of intravenous drug abuse, hepatitis C
and alcohol abuse who originally presented to an outside
hospital on [**4-10**], with complaints of hematemesis.  In the
Emergency Room, the patient was noted to be febrile and
jaundice with a hematocrit of 16,000 and platelet count of
8,000.  The patient was intubated for airway protection and
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where her seven day
course was notable for pancytopenia, hepatic insufficiency,
DIC and the discovery of tricuspid valve endocarditis.  The
patient received large blood product resuscitation and
reportedly stopped bleeding from her nasogastric tube.  By
report, echocardiogram revealed an approximately 5 cm
tricuspid vegetation and she had gram positive cocci in
clusters on culture.  The patient was treated with
gentamicin, clindamycin and Vancomycin and she was
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] on [**4-16**].

Here, the patient was found to have Peptostreptococcus and
Fusobacterium as the presumed sources of her endocarditis.
The patient was treated with penicillin and Flagyl.  She
remained critically ill on a ventilator and pressors despite
optimal antibiotic therapy.  She continued to have persistent
fevers and repeat echocardiogram revealed 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, positive bubble study and a persistence of the
mass.  Given the apparent failure of medical management, the
patient went to the Operating Room on [**5-3**], for tricuspid
valve repair.  She underwent a posterior and mid septal
resection and bicuspidization repair.  The patient tolerated
the procedure relatively well and returned to the Intensive
Care Unit in moderately stable condition.  She subsequently
underwent bronchoscopy on [**5-9**].  Both samples of the BAL
and pleural fluid revealed no growth.  The patient
subsequently developed a nosocomial lingula infiltrate
presumed secondary to the ventilator and was started on
Ceftazidime.

The patient was gradually weaned off of pressors and was
finally extubated on [**5-13**].  She remained stable and was
transferred to the General Medicine Floor on [**5-14**], for
continued management of her right-sided endocarditis with
septic pulmonary emboli and nosocromial pneumonia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Intravenous drug abuse; 2.
Alcohol abuse; 3.  Hepatitis C; 4.  Cellulitis [**2179-9-27**]
secondary to intravenous drug abuse; 5.  Multiple traumas and
broken bones; 6.  Migraine headaches; 7.  History of
scoliosis.

ALLERGIES:  Aspirin and Motrin reported to cause the patient
to bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  Penicillin G 4 million
units intravenously q. 4 hours; Flagyl 500 mg intravenously
q. 8; Nystatin swish and swallow; Miconazole powder; Tylenol;
Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.; Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.;
Ceftazidime 1 gm q. 8 hours; Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o.
q.d.; Ativan 2 to 5 mg intravenously q. 2-4 hours; Atrovent
and albuterol nebulizer treatments; Percocet 1 to 2 q. 4 to 6
hours prn; Tramadol 50 mcg q.i.d.; Protonix 40 mcg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes one pack per day.  She
has a history of polysubstance abuse as mentioned above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of 97.7,
blood pressure 110/68, pulse 79, respiratory rate of 20, she
was sating 98% on 4 liters.  In general, she is an alert,
chronically ill-appearing female who complains of right arm
soreness.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed left pupil is larger than her right but both are
reactive.  Her extraocular movements are intact.  Her neck is
supple without lymphadenopathy.  She has regular rate and
rhythm with II/VI systolic ejection murmur over the lower
left sternal border.  Her sternal wound is clean and without
erythema, swelling or exudate.  Respiratory examination, she
has coarse rhonchi throughout.  Her abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are warm with 1+ lower
extremity edema to the mid shins.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had white blood cell count of
13.8, hematocrit 30.8, platelet count of 366.  She had a
sodium of 138, potassium 3.6, chloride 101, carbon dioxide
31, BUN 5, creatinine .2, glucose 79, calcium 8.0, phosphate
2.8, magnesium 1.3.

Radiology studies - Computerized tomography scan of the chest
on [**5-8**] revealed cavitary lung nodules and multifocal
groundglass opacities, improved from the prior study.  Marked
progression in alveolar consolidation in the left lower lobe
and lingula consistent with superimposed secondary infection.
A moderate to large pericardial effusion.  Increase in her
bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small
on the left.  Computerized tomography scan of her abdomen on
[**5-9**], the liver, spleen, adrenals and kidneys were
unremarkable.  She has extensive ascites and anasarca.  Chest
x-ray from [**5-13**], revealed continued patchy opacities at
both bases.

Microbiologic data - BAL from [**5-9**], revealed 2+ polys, no
organisms and no growth on culture.  Pleural fluid [**5-9**], no
growth.  Blood culture from [**5-9**] and [**5-8**] revealed no
growth to date times two sets.  Sputum from [**5-7**], revealed
rare growth or oropharyngeal Flora.  Stool from [**5-7**],
Clostridium difficile negative.  The catheter tip from [**5-6**], no growth.  Urine culture [**5-6**], greater than 100,000
organisms/ml of yeast.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 43 year old woman with a
history of intravenous drug abuse and alcohol abuse admitted
with tricuspid valve endocarditis presumed secondary to
Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium, status post surgical
repair who was transferred to the General Medical Floor from
the Intensive Care Unit for further management.

1.  Infectious disease - Per the Infectious Disease Consult
Service, the patient is to be continued on Flagyl and
Penicillin to complete a four week course starting on [**3-14**].  In addition, given her likely ventilator associated
pneumonia, she will be continued on Ceftazidime to complete a
two week course, ending on [**5-23**].  Of note, the patient will
need a repeat computerized tomography scan of her chest in
several months to evaluate for any interval change in the
status of her lungs.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was continued on nebulizer
treatments as needed.  Her oxygen saturations remained
relatively stable, ranging from approximately 95 to 97% on 4
liters of oxygen by nasal cannula.  The patient received
chest physical therapy as well as an aggressive pulmonary
toilet.  As mentioned previously, the patient will require a
repeat computerized tomography scan of her chest to evaluate
for any interval change.

3.  Heme - The patient was noted to have anemia.  She had her
stools guaiaced and they were negative for evidence of blood.
The patient's iron studies were most consistent with anemia
of chronic disease.

4.  Pain - The patient complained repeatedly of nonspecific
diffuse pain.  Given her drug abuse history, it was very
difficult to ascertain whether the pain was real or not.  We
thus attempted to minimize her narcotic use.  We provided her
with Tramadol and Percocet as needed for pain.  Despite this,
the patient continued to request pain medications.  Of note,
the patient has indicated a desire to attend a detoxification
facility.  We recommend that at the end of her rehabilitation
stay, the patient be evaluated for potential placement in an
inpatient detoxification facility.

5.  Disposition - The patient was seen by the physical
therapy service, who felt that she would benefit from an
acute rehabilitation stay to return to her previous level of
functioning.  By the time the patient arrived to the General
Medical Floor her condition was significantly improved.  Our
focus became finding an appropriate facility for her.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Tricuspid valve endocarditis, status
