cannula oxygen by day of life three and went to RA on DOL 6.

Cardiovascular:  The infant's blood pressure has been stable
throughout her hospital course. She has not required fluid
boluses or pressors for blood pressure support.  No murmurs
have been auscultated.  Given her high level of respiratory
support, a preliminary cardiac evaluation was undertaken.
Four extremity blood pressures were done and were found to be
normal.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Upon admission to the
newborn Intensive Care Unit, intravenous fluids of D10-W were
initiated at 60 cc per kg per day.  She was kept n.p.o. until

culture was negative at that time.  Infant was started on
Ampicillin and Gentamycin upon admission to the Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit.

Given her high level of respiratory support, and some
temperature instability on day of life two, an lumbar
puncture was done which revealed three white blood cells,
three red blood cells.  The culture of the cerebrospinal
fluid was negative.  Protein of 69 and a glucose of 61.  The
