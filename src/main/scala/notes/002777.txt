Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Dyspnea: She had several days of worsening dyspnea on exertion
at home, and was found to be hypoxic on admission.  She has a
history of severe CO2 retention in the past with minimal
increase in O2 supplementation, thought secondary to CHF with
some contribution from restrictive lung disease.  She has
required intubation for hypercarbic respiratory acidosis in the
past.  She was ruled out for an acute MI.   She had a LLL
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  Although she did not have a very
convincing story or picture for pneumonia, she was started on
antibiotics for CAP due to her increased oxygen requirement.
Her bumetanide dose was increased in an effort to increased
diuresis as CHF exacerbation was thought partially responsible
for her increased O2 requirement.  She has a questionable
diagnosis of COPD in the past.  She was put on MDIs, steroids,
and her outpatient salmeterol for possible COPD exacerbation.
The day after admission, she was found to be hypoxic to 70s on
2L.  She had normal mentation and no acute distress.  She was
extremely resistant to increasing her oxygen as she is very
fearful that she will retain carbon dioxide.  She went to the
MICU for a night to increase O2, and tolerated 6L well.  She was
eventually weaned to 1.5-2L to keep sats >88%.  However, she was
adamantly against the idea of continuous home O2 as she felt it
would significantly limit her movement and thus decreased her
quality of life.  She was advised by both the housestaff and the
attending to wear her O2 as much as she possibly can at home.
She was discharged on the increased dose of bumetanide, her
outpatient salmeterol, and a prednisone taper.  She will follow
up with her PCP.
.
# CHF: She has a history of diastolic CHF with EF 60% and E/A
ratio 0.58.  Her bumetanide dose was increased as above.  She
was maintained on her isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine and
had good control of her blood pressure.
.
# PAF: She was initially maintained on her outpatient dose of
diltiazem.  She had 2 runs of NSVT on the morning of [**6-2**], so a
third dose of diltiazem was added.  She maintained sinus rhythm
and had no further NSVT.  She was also maintained on Coumadin
and had a therapeutic INR.
.
# Supratherapeutic INR: She is on Coumadin for PAF and history
of CVA.  Her INR was 4.2 on admission.  She had no signs of
bleeding.  Coumadin was held for 2 days, then started back at
her outpatient dose.
.
# FEN: Low salt diet. 1.5L fluid restriction.
.
# Code status: FULL CODE.
