HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was diagnosed with an expanding
right groin hematoma.  She was taken emergently into the
operating room where she underwent an exploration of the
right groin, found to have a ruptured anastomotic
pseudoaneurysm from a previously placed femoral to femoral
bypass graft, and
underwent revision of the fem-fem bypass graft.  Intraoperative

units of packed red blood cells, 700 of cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**] and 3 of
fresh-frozen plasma.  She made 515 urine.

Postoperatively, she was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit in an intubated fashion.  Hemodynamically, she remained
stable and was extubated on postoperative day #2, and over
the next several days, she remained in stable condition.

On postoperative day #2, there was a drop in her platelets
from 108 to 66.  Her Heparin was stopped and was evaluated
for Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.  Then on postoperative
day five, the patient became hypotensive and tachycardic.
She required pressor support.

near the graft.  She was taken back to the operating room for
an exploration of the right groin drainage of an organized
hematoma and sartorius muscle flap coverage of the graft.

the ventilatory support.  She was diuresed appropriately and
her hemodynamics improved.  She was extubated and at that
time, the patient's families and patient determined that she
would made a DNR/DNI, and should she have respiratory arrest,
she will be made comfortable.

She continued to be stable.  Blood cultures which had been
sent during her episodes of sepsis had demonstrated MRSA.
She was treated with appropriate antibiotics. Her blood cultures
cleared, and she remained afebrile and without an elevated wbc.
By
postoperative day 18, patient was transferred to the VICU.
There she was maintained with chest physiotherapy, TPN, and
would have episodes of shortness of breath which should
respond to diuresis.

By postoperative day #23, patient continued to acquire
aggressive pulmonary toilet.  Was having many episodes of
shortness of breath and was requiring maximal oxygen therapy
to maintain O2 saturations.  Patient and her family decided
that appropriate action would be to have the patient comfort
measures only.

Morphine drip, made comfortable, and she expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Ruptured pseudoaneurysm.
2. Sepsis secondary to wound infection.
3. Respiratory failure requiring extended ventilatory wean.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. History of cerebrovascular accidents.
7. Peripheral vascular disease.
