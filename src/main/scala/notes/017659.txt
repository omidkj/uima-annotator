Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old male with
history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,
diabetes mellitus and pneumonia who was admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] for dyspnea and found to have
a right pneumothorax.  He had a chest tube placed during
hospital course.  The patient has a history of multiple prior
admissions in the past few months for pneumonias.  Chest tube
was placed during this hospital course.  The chest tube was
discontinued shortly afterwards after discovery that it was
misplaced.  The right lung was re-expanded.  Pleural
effusions managed with diuresis.

A renal consult was obtained for an increasing BUN and
creatinine.  It was thought that there was a prerenal picture
was developing.  Renal ultrasound was recommended.  Heart
Failure Service was consulted and recommended transfer to CCU
for aggressive diuresis, pressor support and Swan-Ganz
placement.  During hospital course, the patient also had 2/4
bottles positive for MRSA, sputum positive for MRSA,
increased white blood cell count to 22.  While on the floor
the patient was started on Levofloxacin and Vancomycin prior
to transfer to CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2123**], four vessel disease, LIMA to LAD, SVG
to D2, SVG to circumflex and SVG to PDA.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
5.  CTCL.
6.  Bilateral renal artery stenosis 60% on the left, 70% on
the right.
7.  Osteoarthritis.
8.  Gout.
9.  Recent echocardiogram revealed LV ejection fraction of
less than 20%

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Ambien which leads to confusion.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO CCU:
1.  Dopamine drip.
2.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. 48 hours.
4.  Vancomycin 1 gram IV dosed by levels.
5.  Regular insulin sliding scale.
6.  Morphine p.r.n.
7.  Zofran p.r.n.
8.  Compazine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs with a temperature of 98.2
F, pulse 60, blood pressure 107/36, respirations 16.  Pulse
oximetry 92%.  In general elderly male who is lethargic.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Moist mucous membranes.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
appreciated.  Pulmonary:  Loud breath sounds, rhonchorus.
Abdomen is obese and soft.  Extremities:  Pitting edema
bilaterally.

INITIAL LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 19.2,
hematocrit of 29.6, platelets 252.  INR 1.1.  Fibrinogen 581.

INITIAL ASSESSMENT:  This is an 80 year-old male admitted to
CCU for aggressive congestive heart failure management, MRSA
bacteremia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  HEART FAILURE:  Patient required pressor support with
Dopamine and eventually Norepinephrine as a bridge for
dialysis.  After dialysis, the patient's heart function
eventually improved and he was able to be weaned off all
pressures.  Patient had no chest pain or chest discomfort
during the entire hospital course.  The patient was monitored
on telemetry during hospital course with no known
abnormalities or runs of ectopy.  The patient was known to
have severe coronary artery disease and was kept on aspirin
and Lipitor throughout hospital course.

2.  RENAL:  Patient with increasing BUN and creatinine in the
setting of congestive heart failure thought to be a prerenal
condition.  Acute renal failure on top of a chronic renal
failure.  Patient's mental status and renal function improved
after a session of dialysis, however patient refused further
dialysis sessions as he thought it would be a new chronic
management that he would need.

3.  PULMONARY:  Patient with decreasing O2 saturations on
presentation.  Patient is known to have coronary artery
disease and it was felt that his decreased pulmonary function
was secondary to congestive heart failure.  Pulmonary
function did improve after dialysis and removal of fluid.
The patient also noted to have MRSA positive sputum and MRSA
positive blood cultures.  The patient was kept on Vancomycin
therapy until the end of hospital course.

4.  ENDOCRINE:  Patient is a known diabetic who placed on
fingersticks q.i.d. with regular insulin sliding scale until
he changed his code status later in hospital course.

5.  CODE STATUS:  Patient and patient's family initially
wanted "everything done", however after a session of dialysis
and a clearing of mental status, the patient and patient's
family were extensively counseled in what lay probably in his
medical future in terms of his extremely grim prognosis given
his multiple medical conditions.  Decision was made by the
patient to become DNR, DNI and to institute comfort measures
only.  All non-necessary medications were discontinued.  The
patient was kept only on comfort medications such as
Morphine, Scopolamine patch.  Fingersticks were discontinued
and a palliative care nurse consultation was performed.

The patient requested not to be transferred out of the
hospital to a Hospice type setting, but rather requested to
remain in the hospital to pass away there.  Overall, once
patient was transferred to CMO type care, the patient
lingered for approximately 30 hours before expiring.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Autopsy refused by family.  Attending and
family made aware of patient's expiration.
