Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal distension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonic decompression tube placed

History of Present Illness:
75 M with history of colonic pseudoobstruction, HTN, PVD, PE,
Anemia, presents with severe abdominal distention over last 3
months.  He had a complicated hospitalization in late [**Month (only) 116**] of
this year for atrial flutter which was complicated by colonic
pseudoobstruction for which he underwent a colonoscopy with
removal of 5L of liquid stool. He failed a trial of neostigmine
due to bradycardia, n/v. He was also given metaclopromide,
erythromycin and rectal stimulation therapy. He was found to
have PEs, and was started on anticoagulation, but unfortunately
developed a massive UGIB necessitating and ICU stay and this was
stopped.  He has been followed for elevated PSAs and was noted
on imaging to have multiple sclerotic lesions concerning for
malignancy. Attempts at prostate biopsy thus far have been
unsuccessful.  Full details on this hospitalization can be found
in the OSH records.  He was discharged to a nursing home in
[**Location (un) 2624**] with f/u scheduled for yesterday with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2643**] of GI.
On arrival to the appointment, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2643**] was so concerned with
the appearance of his distended abdomen that he sent him
directly to the ED.
.
In the ED he was seen by surgery who felt he did not have acute
obstruction; CT abd showed stool-filled colon with dilation
without obstruction concerning for Olgilvie's syndrome.  An NGT
was placed. Labs notable for low K, repleted.  Initial VS: 97.9
130/83 75 18 96% on RA. Given 1L NS. VS at time of transfer:
96.9 65 140/97 16 97% on RA.
.
On the floor the patient is complaining chiefly of feeling
fatigued.  He denies abdominal discomfort. States that the
abdominal distention has come on gradually and has been present
for several months.  He has had a 20+ lb weight loss in this
time. Reports decreased appetite without n/v.  Has been passing
"soupy" stools.  No chest pain. Does endorse labored breathing
for several weeks.  No fevers or chills. Chronic low back pain.
Chronic LE edema with venous ulcer.  No heartburn.
.
ROS was otherwise essentially negative.

CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:

1. Dominant perihepatic (ascitic) fluid adjacent to the liver
has a large
locule of air; peritoneal enhancement and peritoneal fluid in
the left
abdomen, and communicating via multiple lobulations of fluid
into the mid
pelvis and the right pelvis has multiple smaller loculations of
air.

In a patient with recent surgery and recent anastomotic [**First Name (STitle) 3564**],
the air may be
postoperative in nature and the peritoneal enhancement from
inflammation and
post-surgical changes; however, in a patient with leukocytosis,
we cannot rule
out superinfection. Lab analysis of the peritoneal fluid is
recommended (may
be aspirated under ultrasound or CT guidance) which may be
feasible via a
targeted paracentesis. If appearing infected, they would be
amenable for
drainage.

2. No extraluminal oral contrast, no evidence of small-bowel
obstruction up
to the level of ileostomy.

3. Due to lack of oral contrast beyond the ileostomy, our
sensitivity for
detecting anastomotic [**First Name (STitle) 3564**] is significantly decreased.

4. Bilateral pleural effusion, with adjacent atelectasis, worse
on the right.

5. Multiple sclerotic osseous lesion concerning for metastatic
disease as
described on prior CT. No clear primary.

has a large

obstruction up
to the level of ileostomy.

KUB:
IMPRESSION: Massive gastric, small bowel, and colonic dilation
without clear transition point. It is unclear whether there is
gas in the rectum. This is an apparent new development as best
can be compared to the pelvis radiograph from [**Month (only) 956**] of this
year. A high-grade obstruction is suspected.  Cross-sectional
imaging is advised.

CT ABD: (wet read) Massive diffuse dilation of the entire colon
and rectum filled with fluid and fecal material. The rectal
contrast id diluted and cannot be seen proximal to the sigmoid
colon. No evidence of obstruction or volvulus. These are
suggestive of [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome.The rectal catheter was placed
in the rectum and a distal rectal/anal lesions cannot be
excluded in this study. No free air. Sclerotic lesions in T12
and L1 are noted.
.
Colonoscopy: [**5-17**]: Normal except evacuation of 5 liters of stool
.
