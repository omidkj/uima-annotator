History of Present Illness:
60 yo male with pmh of CAD s/p stents, a fib, laryngeal
carcinoma s/p chemo and XRT, and small cell lung ca currently
being treated with chemo presented with 2 days of shortness of
breath, a productive cough, and an increased O2 requirement.  He

05/[**2175**]. (stage T3, N1 or stage III laryngeal cancer. Followed
with serial PET/CT and found on [**1-/2177**] a 7 mm right lower lobe
nodule not FDG avid. Repeated PET/CT [**Month (only) 359**]/[**2177**] [**Hospital1 112**] showed
large right lower lobe mass 7x4.5 cm with extension to hilum.
Pulmonary consulted and given rapid change of mass treated with
10 days of Levofloxacin. Repeated CT [**12-16**] whowed a large right
lower lobe consolidation with positive CT angiogram with
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy. Also 1 cm RUL nodule.
Bronchial washing [**12-25**]--> showed suspicion for squamous cell
carcinoma. Transbronchial neuroaspirate was positive for
squamous cell carcinoma. F/u PET Scan on [**1-13**] reveal FDG avid
right lower lobe focus witn bronchial narrowin and distal
consolidation.
Then Chemo/radioation with low dose [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol and XRT

EKG: a fib with HR in the 120's, no ST changes

Tele - a fib with HR ranging from 110's to 140's

Imaging:
CXR [**2178-8-26**]:  There is large confluent opacity at the right lung
base with areas of air bronchograms. The right hemidiaphragm is
obscured by this opacity. There is peribronchial thickening in
the left upper lobe. There are no focal consolidations in the
left lung. The appearances in the right lung most likely
represent a combination of the known lung cancer and a pneumonic
consolidation.

CT chest [**2178-8-26**]: 1. Marked increase in right lung
consolidation, probably radiation pneumonia, less likely
infection. Unchanged right hilar mass.
2. New multifocal alveolitis/interstitial pneumonia, left lung,
could be
radiation injury if the radiation portal was wider than
expected, radiation induced cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or
multifocal viral infection.
3. Newly enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes since [**8-3**]. Newly
enlarged left hilar lymph nodes could be reactive or neoplastic.

4. Unchanged multiloculated malignant right pleural effusion.
5. Tiny pericardial effusion, improved.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  60 yo male with pmh of CAD s/p stents, a fib, laryngeal
carcinoma s/p chemo and XRT, and small cell lung ca currently
being treated with chemo who presents with increasing SOB,
cough, and O2 requirement likely secondary to pneumonia.
.
The patient presented with a productive cough, leukocytosis,
increasing O2 requirement, and worsening SOB and a CXR
suggestive of pneumonia.  As the patient was found to be in a.
fib, some of his shortness of breath could be due to a fib with
RVR. He also had a known persistent malignant pleural effusion
in his right lung. He was initally treated with levofloxacin and
flagyl, however he continued to require increasing amounts of
oxygen, so his coverage was broadened to vancomycin and zosyn.
O2 sats remained at around 93% on 6L of NC and he then had his
brachytherapy implants placed on [**8-31**] at [**Hospital3 **] (as
previously scheduled).  Upon his return from [**Hospital1 1774**] he was sating
88% on a nonrebreather.  His O2 sats came up to 93% and he was
weaned to 6L, however later in the day he was found to be sating
mid 80's on 6L and was put back on a nonrebreather.  Due to his
increased O2 requirement and tachypnea he was transferred to the
MICU.
.
Shortly following transfer to the MICU, he required intermittent
and then sustained use of bipap to support his oxygenation and
ventilation.  He was clear that he did not wish to be intubated.
 Steroids and diuresis were attempted in case there was any
component of inflammation and/or volume overload respectively.
His dyspnea and hypoxemia continued.  Morphine was given for
symptomatic relief and focus was made on patient comfort.  He
passed away in the presence of his family on [**2178-9-1**].  Autopsy
was declined.
