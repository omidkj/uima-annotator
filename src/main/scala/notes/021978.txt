   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2135-9-13**] 9:16 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: pneumothorax/pleural effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old man s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pneumothorax/pleural effusion
AP AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**9-13**]

HISTORY: Status post CABG. Pneumothorax and possible pleural
effusion.

IMPRESSION: AP and lateral chest compared to [**9-5**] through
5:

Lung volumes remain low following CABG after extubation and the
enlargement of the postoperative cardiomediastinal silhouette
has probably increased due to some accumulation of mediastinal
fluid. Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**9-8**].
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions remain. No
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2135-9-1**] after a catheterization earlier that day revealed a 90%
occluded LAD, 95% occluded circ, and totally occluded PDA.
After pre-operative work-up he was taken to the operating room
on [**2135-9-5**] and underwent a coronary artery bypass gfraft times
three and patent foramen ovale closure performed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**], MD.  Bypass time was 79 minutes and cross clamp time
was 55 minutes.  He tolerated the procedure well and was able to
be transferred in stable condition to the unit on nitro and
propofol.
In the CSRU Mr. [**Known lastname **] was noted to be unable to lift his
bilateral upper and lower extremities off the bed and presented
with myoclonic movements.  He was seen in consult by the
neurology service.  A subsequent MRI revealed no acute stroke
and Mr. [**Known lastname 68875**] myoclonic movements and weakness improved with
time.  His pressors were weaned and he was extubated.  His chest
tubes and epicardial wires were removed.  By post-operative day
5 he was ready for transfer in stable condition to the floor.
On the floor Mr. [**Known lastname **] was seen by physical therapy, his blood
pressure regimen was maximaized, and he was gently diuresed.
His neurological complaints improved markedly.  By
post-operative day 12 he was ready for discharge in stable
condition to a rehabilitation facility.
