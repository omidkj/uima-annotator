History of Present Illness:
52 year old woman with h/o aortic valve endocarditis s/p
replacement with embolic CVA, Hepatitis C, chronic venous stasis
ulcers, and multiple GI bleeds in past with negative work up who
came to the ED on [**2144-7-4**] with 3 days of bright red blood per
rectum with bowel movements. She reported [**12-20**] BMs per day. Pt
was tolerating POs but noted mild decrease in appetite. SHe
denied melena, abdominal pain, hemoptysis, hematemesis. She
denied chest pain, palpitations but did note one episode of
shortness of breath. The patient has a history of GIB in past
while on coumadin for anticoagulation and has had an extensive
negative workup for a source of the bleed. Labs have revealed an
iron deficiency anemia and intermittent guaic positive stools
but EGD x2(98/99) have revealed only gastritis and a single
non-bleeding diverticulum in middle third of esophagus. The
patient has also had negative colonoscopy x2 and a negative
angiogram in [**2138**]. Bleeding thought to be secondary to small AVM
(although never visualized) and empiric estrogen, ex-lap/intraop
enteroscopy have also been entertained in the past.


Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] aortic valve replacement in [**2137**].
 2.  History of endocarditis (staph, strep, candidal)
 3.  History of hepatitis C.
 4.  Peripheral vascular disease with nonhealing LE ulcers.
 5.  Cerebrovascular disease.
 6.  Hypertension.
 7.  Reflux disease.
 8.  Anemia.
 9.  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2137**].
10.  History of gastrointestinal bleed (-) colonoscopy x2; (-)
angio in [**2138**].


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, the patients HCT was 21, she was given 6U PRBC and a
Right cordis was placed. She was hemodynamically stable and
transferred to the ICU where she was hemodynamically stable and
her hematocrit remained stable x 1 d before she was transferred
to the floor.

A/P  52 yo female with h/o aortic valve endocarditis s/p
replacemnet, CVA, Hep C, chronic leg ulcers, and history of
multiple GI bleeds with (-) workup presents with BRBRP. Hct
found to be 21.2 on admission.

1.  GI bleed
Pt with HCT of 21.2 on admission. In ED received 1 u PRBCs and
patient received another unit when transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. On
the floors, HCT was initially checked tid, then [**Hospital1 **]; it was
stable (33-36) from [**Date range (1) 107841**]. She was treated with pantoprazole
40 mg PO and remained NPO and on maintenance intravenous fluids.
She was maintained on heparin during this time for her
prosthetic valve. On [**7-6**] she was given subcutaneous vitamin K
to reverse her coumadin induced anticoagulated state. On [**7-7**],
she was given 4 U FFP before undergoing an EGD which showed a
hiatal hernia and schatski's ring, but no source of bleeding.
She also had a colonoscopy which was limited by the patient
having stool throughout her colon. During the limited study, a
sigmoid polyp was found but no removal was completed secondary
to the excessive stool. She refused to drink more go-lytely for
a repeat colonoscopy so she underwent a pill endoscopy on [**7-9**]
which showed bright red blood and clots in stomach; no active
bleeding site was found from esophagus to cecum. On [**7-13**], she
had a repeat EGD to reevaluate for the source of bleeding. It
showed a single non-bleeding diverticulum in the middle third of
the esophagus and erythema associated with gastritis. No source
of bleeding was identified. Her hematocrit remained stable
during this time and she had no bloody stools after [**2061-7-6**].

2. Heart Valve
Pt has a [**Hospital3 **] aortic valve. She is on coumadin 2.5 mg qhs
at home.Her therapeutic INR is 2.5-3.5. On admission, the
patient was actively bleeding. The risks of further GI bleeding
versus the need for anticoagulation were weighed and it was
decided that she needed anticoagulation so her coumadin was held
and she was started on heparin. On [**7-13**], her coumadin was
restarted at 3 mg qhs for 3 doses. Her INR was 2.5 on discharge
and she was sent home on her home dose of coumadin 2.5 mg qhs.
She will follow up with [**Doctor Last Name **] for anticoagulation and INR on
[**2144-7-21**].

3. CAD/CHF
On admission the patient was treated with intravenous fluids.
Her lasix was held secondary to her gi bleed and dehydrated
state. On [**7-9**], she received IVFs plus IV antibiotics plus 4U
FFP and developed some pulmonary edema and shortness of breath.
She was treated with 20 mg IV Lasix x 2 and the edema and
shortness of breath resolved. She was restarted on her home dose
of 40 mg Lasix PO and did not develop further shortness of
breath or pulmonary edema with this dose.

4. Endocarditis
Pt with history of fungal endocarditis, she was maintained on
her fluconazole prophylaxis.

5. HTN - On [**7-4**] her enalapril was restarted at her home dose.
Her blood pressures were controlled on the enalapril.

6. Leg ulcers - She was seen by vascular surgery who noted that
there was no change in her previous Left leg ulcer. She was
continued with wet--> dry dressing changes qd and percoset as
needed for the pain.

7. Methadone maintainance - she was maintained on her home dose
of 40 mg methadone po qd. she will be followed by the VNA for
her methadone dose as an o/p.

8. Low magnesium - her magnesium was 1.5-1.7 throughout the
admission. She was repleted as needed. She did not want any new
medications to go home on, but as an outpatient a magnesium
supplement should be considered.
