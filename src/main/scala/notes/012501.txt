Service: NEUROLOGY

Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening dysphagia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation.
Placement of a pheresis line.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 54 year-old left-handed gentleman who initially
presented to [**Hospital 878**] Clinic on a semi-urgent basis over
concerns for worsening dysphagia.
Two weeks PTA, he began to suffer from nasal congestion and
noted that the mestinon seemed to be wearing off after three or
four hours.  At that time, he was taking mestinon five times per
day while awake and we increased the frequency to six times per
day in attempt to reduce the "wearing off" phenomenon.  His
nasal congestion eventually cleared and he seemed to be
beginning to improve. However, five days PTA the nasal
congestion returned. His wife noted that she has been recently
ill with bronchitis and thinks that maybe he has also become
infected. He denied fever or shortness of breath over this time.
Since the onset of his illness, however, he has become
progressively more fatigued and his ability to swallow has
gotten worse.  At first, he was able to drink his boost shakes
and take his mestinon syrup, but starting on the morning of
admission, he has not been able to swallow anything. His wife
noted that he has not slept well since symptom onset because he
is forced to sleep in a sitting position.  He noted that if he
lies down, he has tremendous difficulty clearing his secretions.
Over this time, his speech has become progressively nasal and,
at times, slurred.

On review of systems, the pt noted that he has lost roughly
twenty pounds since diagnosed with myasthenia in [**Month (only) 958**] of this
year.  He stated that this has been unintentional and rightly
blames it on poor p.o. intake. He denied cough, shortness of
breath, chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent
change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias.

Past Medical History:
-Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]: Diagnosed in [**2170-4-4**], as discussed in my
previous notes. Anti-ACh receptor antibody positive. EMG
performed in [**2170-4-4**] demonstrated abnormal jitter,
evidence
of neuromuscular transmission blocking. Nerve conduction studies
at that time demonstrated abnormal decrement on repetitive
stimulation. CT of the chest in [**2170-4-4**] was negative for
thymoma.  Admitted a total of three times in [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2170-4-4**] during which time he underwent a total of seven courses of
plasmapheresis with clinical response.  Baseline PFTs in [**2170-4-4**] were normal.
-Pulmonic stenosis
-Status-post appendectomy at age 7

Social History:
Lives at home with wife and daughter.  [**Name (NI) 1403**] in [**University/College 7709**] court
house.  Quit smoking 20 years ago, has 7 pack year history.
Social use of alcohol. No use of illicit drugs.


Family History:
Remarkable for a paternal aunt with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]. No
history of thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, juvenille onset
diabetes or other autoimmune phenomena.

scleral icterus noted, mucus membranes moist, no lesions noted
in oropharynx
Neck: Full range of motion, no cervical tenderness; no jugular
venous distention or carotid bruits appreciated.
Pulmonary: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally without
adventitious sounds
Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm, S1S2, II/VI crescendo-
decrescendo holosystolic murmur best heard in pulmonic area
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, normoactive bowel
sounds, no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: No peripheral edema bilaterally, 2+ radial,
dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
Mental status: Alert, oriented in all three spheres. Able to
relate history without difficulty. Attentive. Language is fluent
with intact repetition and comprehension, but is voice is nasal
with episodic dysarthria.

Cranial nerves: Olfaction not tested. Pupils equal round and
reactive to light, 3.5 to 2mm and brisk. Visual fields were full
to confrontation. There was roughly one millimeter of ptosis on
the right. Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates,
or hemorrhages. Extraocular muscles intact without nystagmus.
There was no diplopia evoked on sustained vertical or lateral
gaze.
Sensation intact to light touch over face. Bifacial weakness on
testing of facial strength. Hearing intact to finger- rub
bilaterally. Palate elevates symmetrically in midline. Full
strength in trapezii and sternocleidomastoids bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes in midline.

Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. There was no pronator
drift. There is 4/5 weakness in the extensors and flexors of the
neck. Full strength in upper and lower extremities, however. He
does have minor facial tics which I have noticed on previous
examinations.

Sensory: No deficits to light touch, pinprick, cold sensation,
vibratory sense, proprioception throughout.

Coordination: No intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia noted. No
dysmetria on finger-nose-finger and heel-knee-shin testing.

Deep tendon reflexes: 2+ biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, 3+
patellar and 2+ ankle jerks bilaterally. Plantar response was
flexor bilaterally.

Gait: Good initiation. Narrow-based, normal arm swing.

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL ([**2170-7-11**]): The heart size and mediastinal
contours are within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is
unremarkable. No focal consolidations are identified. There is
no pleural effusion and no pneumothorax. Surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are unremarkable. The previously reported
subtle opacity of the left lower lobe is not appreciated on the
current study.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2170-7-20**]
Extensive consolidation in the left lower lobe has improved
slightly, but may now contain new cavitation. Smaller region of
consolidation at the medial aspect of the right lung base is
stable. Overall, findings suggest extensive pneumonia, perhaps
due to aspiration. ET tube in standard placement. Feeding tube
ends in the upper stomach. Tip of the right supraclavicular
central venous line projects over the SVC. Small left pleural
effusion is new since [**7-18**]. There is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]/Myasthenic Crisis:  The pt was admitted to
the Neurology Service from Clinic over concern for worsening
dysphagia and dysarthria.  It was postulated that the
symptomatic worsening was due to a combination of URI and a
"wearing off" of the previous round of plasmapheresis. The pt
expressed his desire to avoid plasmapheresis given bruising that
he experienced during the last round of pheresis in [**Month (only) 547**].
Therefore, a course of IVIg was started on hospital day 2 after
IgA level returned normal.  Over the course of the next three
days, his weakness worsened so much that he required NG tube
placement for nutrition and his medications (most of which were
given IV on admission due to dysphagia).  On hospital day four,
his NIF and FVC worsened.  ABG at that time wa
