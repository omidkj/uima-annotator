History of Present Illness:
51 y/o F w/alcoholic cirrhosis, s/p banding of varices in last
year, who presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital today after vomiting
bright red blood. While there, she vomited initially 700 cc BRB
and then 1500 cc during EGD. BP dropped as low as 80s but
responded with volume (received 500 NS, 1500 Hespan, 3 U PRBCs).
She was intubated for airway protection and a femoral line was
placed for access. She was placed on octreotide gtt and given
levofloxacin for prophylaxis. EGD demonstrated massive GI bleed
near GEJ likely from grade IV esohpageal varices, large amt of
fresh blood and clots. one column of varix had whitish spot.
Placed five bands at distal esophagus. She was transferred here
for ? TIPS.
.
Per her fiance, she was hospitalized one week ago for abdominal
pain and swelling. She was told she had an infection and was on
antibiotics, but never had a paracentesis. She had also been
taking vitamin K. She has "coughed up" blood in the past and has
had bands placed once in the past.


Past Medical History:
1. Cirrhosis, diagnosed in last year per fiance. Initially there
was a question of Hep C, per him tests were first positive and
subsequently negative
2. Hx of VRE per chart
3. Hx "nonspecific colitis"
4. Hx C Diff
5. ? pancreatic mass

IMAGING:
[**2157-5-13**] ABD U/S: Four-quadrant ultrasound shows a trace of fluid
only, the largest pocket been identified in the right lower
quadrant. This is not suitable for planned paracentesis and no
spot was marked. Limited views of the liver show somewhat
nodular outline consistent with cirrhosis.
.
[**2157-5-13**] LIVER U/S: Pulsatile flow is demonstrated in the IVC and
major hepatic veins. The portal vein and hepatic arteries are
patent. The liver is shrunken and nodular, and ascites is
present. The common bile duct is not dilated, a stone is present
within the neck of the gallbladder. A 3.2-cm cyst is present in
the right lobe, unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Cirrhotic liver with ascites. Patent portal and
hepatic vessels
.
[**2157-5-17**] ABD U/S: Patent TIPS shunts with velocities ranging from
52-221 cm/sec. The hepatic venous velocities are rather high and
consequently a short-term followup study is recommended to
reevaluate and exclude the possibility of stenosis at the
hepatic venous stent.
.
[**2157-5-19**] RUE U/S: Right cephalic and brachial vein thrombosis.
.
[**2157-5-19**] ECHO:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
2. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2157-5-21**] CXR: Endotracheal tube is approximately 3 cm above
carina. NG tube is in body of stomach. Left jugular CV line is
in mid SVC. No pneumothorax. Right lateral chest is not included
on the film. Persistent opacity consistent with atelectasis in
the left lower lobe is again demonstrated, slightly improved
since prior film of same date.
.
[**2157-5-22**] CT a/p:
1. Cirrhotic liver with portal hypertension.
2. Peripheral wedge-shaped hypoenhancing areas within the
spleen, likely infarcts.
3. There are no focal enhancing liver lesions.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. TIPS in place.
6. Multiple enlarged portosystemic varices in the upper abdomen.

7. Replaced right hepatic artery arising from the SMA.
8. Enlarged lymph nodes as described much larger than we
typically see in patients with cirrhosis, does the patient has
any other underlying liver disease?
9. Hepatic cyst.
10. NG tube in place.
.
[**2157-5-24**] renal U/S: Normal-sized kidneys with no hydronephrosis.
.
[**2157-5-30**] CXR:
1. Worsening left retrocardiac opacity. Although possibly due to
a
combination of atelectasis and effusion, pneumonia should be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Minimal hazy opacity in right upper lobe, for which an early
focus of pneumonia is not excluded.
.
[**2157-5-31**] PFTs: performed, report pending
.
[**2157-5-31**] LIVER U/S: There has been resolution/reabsorption of
nearly all of the ascites and there is insufficient amount for
ultrasound-guided paracentesis.
.
[**2157-6-3**] CXR:
1. Persistent left pleural effusion and left retrocardiac
opacity. Although this may represent a combination of
atelectasis and effusion, pneumonia should be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting.
2. Mild pulmonary interstitial edema.
3. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2157-6-3**] MANDIBLE XR/PANOREX: Limited study. No evidence of
fractures or gross bony abscess. Further characterization of the
dentition could be performed with a Panorex view if clinical
