Images:

EEG: [**7-18**]:
This is an abnormal awake and sleep EEG, because of intermittent

left temporal slowing in the theta range and a single sharp wave
in the left anterior temporal lobe. These findings are
indicative of a potentially epileptogenic region of dysfunction
in the left temporal region.

CXR [**2192-7-17**]
Endotracheal tube is low lying, terminating approximately 1.5 cm
from the carina. Orogastric tube tip is seen within the distal
stomach. The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. Minimal streaky
opacity in the left lung base may reflect atelectasis. No large
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. There are no acute
osseous abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:
1. Low lying endotracheal tube terminating approximately 1.5 cm
from the carina, for which withdrawal is recommended.
2. Standard position of orogastric tube.
3. Left basilar atelectasis.
.
CT HEAD [**2192-7-17**]
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large

territorial infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and
configuration for age.  The basal cisterns appear patent and
there is
preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.  No fracture
is identified. Partial opacification of the nasal cavity and
ethmoidal air cells is likely related to the pat
