History of Present Illness:
This 65 yo female was seen here in [**2140**] with a report of her
bowels worked normally until [**Month (only) 956**] of '[**39**] when she developed
dysphagia for which she underwent a procedure at the [**Hospital **]
Hospital which appears to be an EGD to repair GERD.  During the
procedure her esophagus was perforated and she required
emergency repair surgery. During this operation, her stomach was
pulled up into her chest and attached to her esophagus and
apparently her lower esophagus was resected.  The doctor told
her that the nerves to her stomach were also cut. Since that
time, the patient has had severe problems with weight loss. She
went from 155 to the 90s. Her [**Last Name **] problem is she cannot keep
anything down.  She is fairly consistent in her report that she
can swallow reasonably well except for pills for some reason get
stuck. However, when she eats food or liquids or just about
anything, this seems to come up. She subsequently had an upper
G.I. series which showed delayed transit to the small bowel but
no evidence of obstruction of the bowel. Small bowel loops were
of normal caliber. There was no abnormality of the mucosa shown
in the barium study.  It took approximately four hours and 15
minutes for the barium to reach the colon. she then received a a
feeding gastrostomy or jejunostomy at osh  but states when she
puts food or formula into the feeding tube she developed severe
vomiting. Therefore she was not really using the feeding tube.
she was then seen here for a second opinion and was initially
treated for small bowel bacterial overgrowth with abx but wasn't
able to tolerate it. she apparently was given PICC line (for
nutrition) and had a feeding gastrotomy tube inserted. Over the
past few months however pt again had decreased PO intake with
weight now down to 87 lbs. Furthermore she complains of vomiting
with hematemesis as well as melaena. she states she's not using
her g tube for feeding because of intermittent bleeding from her
gastrostomy tube as well as diarrhoea that seems to start with g
tube feeding. she further complains of [**Last Name (un) 103**] pain around mid and
lower part without radiation. it's a sharp pain that's
constantly there for sometime and there's no exacerbating or
relieving factors. she was therefore admitted for further eval

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality; tachycardia; hyperdynamic
left ventricle
.
EGD [**9-17**]: Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum
.

Sigmoidoscopy [**9-21**]:
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Stool in the sigmoid colon
Examination was terminated due to patient discomfort.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to sigmoid colon
.
CT abdomen [**10-1**]:
No evidence of bowel obstruction or other acute change from
prior
study of [**2142-9-12**], except to note evidence of third spacing with
increasing
subcutaneous edema, small bilateral pleural effusions and small
pelvic fluid.

.
Gastric Emptying Study [**10-4**]:
INTERPRETATION: Following the oral ingestion of a low-fat egg
white meal
consisting of 4 oz of egg whites, two slices of toast, 30 gm jam
or jelly and 120 ml water, the patient was placed supine beneath
the gamma camera.
Continuous anterior and posterior images of tracer activity in
the stomach and bowel were recorded for 45 minutes. Delayed
anterior and posterior images were obtained at 2 and 4 hours.
Initial continuous images demonstrate persistent tracer activity
in the
intrathoracic gastric pullthrough. It is unclear if this
represents delayed transit or gastroesophageal reflux. There is
no significant gastric emptying.  On delayed images, the
entirety of ingested tracer activity remains in the stomach for
the duration of the study, with no evidence for transit into the
small bowel.
IMPRESSION:
Markedly abnormal study with no signficant gastric emptying over
four hours.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old female with COPD on 2L oxygen, esophageal
perforation s/p esophagectomy and severe gastroparesis
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute respiratory failure requiring
intubation with multiple failed extubations.

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient with severe COPD and
possible aspiration PNA with recent left-sided iatrogenic PTX.
She had failed extubation x3, and given her instrinsic lung
disease and recent aspiration pneumonia, would be very difficult
to successfully extubate in the short-term, especially with NIF
of -17. Following family meeting, decision made to not proceed
with trach and to plan for extubation with transition to comfort
