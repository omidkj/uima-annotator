CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2110-5-8**]
The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal
of the NG tube. The right main bronchus appears stented on the
current radiograph with ( 4.5 cm stent) and the proximal portion
of the stent is minimally protruding into the carina. There is
subsequent significant improvement of the right upper and middle
lobe aeration with relatively small residual atelectasis still
present in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe. The
mediastinal position is now central. The bulging of the right
hilar area most likely corresponding to the known tumor. The
left lung is clear. No substantial pleural effusion is
demonstrated as well as there is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2816**] was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] intubated, for
evaluation of central airway obstruction.  He was taken to the
OR for flexible and rigid bronchoscopy, tumor debridement and
stent placement. He tolerated the procedure well and was
extubated without difficulty.  On HD 2 he underwent flexible
bronchoscopy to evaluate stent patency.  A small amount of
secretions were suctioned clear.  He transferred to the floor.
On HD#3 he was weaned from oxygen RA sats of 94% and was
transferred to home.  He will follow-up with Thoracic Oncology
as an outpatient.
