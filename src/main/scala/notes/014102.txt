artery to left anterior descending with saphenous vein grafts to
ramus, obtuse marginal and PLV.

History of Present Illness:
78 y.o man with history of DM, CKD and hyperlipidemia who
presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with stuttering chest pain of 3
days duration.  The patient's pain was intermittent, squeezing
in nature, and radiated to his neck and he initially felt that
it was gastrointestinal in nature.  When the pain became worse
he presented to the [**Hospital1 **] emergency room.  There, he was found
to have an EKG concerning for an anterior STEMI with ST
elevations in V1-V3 as well as in aVR.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further therapy.
.
He was brought to the cardiac catherization lab and
catheterization  demonstated severe multivessel disease.  No
intervention was performed. An intra aortic balloon pump was
placed. Cardiac surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation for
coronary bypass grafting.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2130-7-31**])
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
 The
left main coronary artery had 50% stenosis.  The LAD had a 70%
ostial
and 90% mid vessel stenosis.  The LCx had a 70% proximal
stenosis.  The
ramus had an ostial 80% stenosis.  The RCA had sequential mid
and distal
80% lesions.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated left sided
filling
pressures with LVEDP 18 mmHg.  There was normal systemic
arterial
pressure with central aortic pressure 110/63 with a mean of 57
mmHg.
3. Successful placement of IABP.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful placement of IABP.
=====================================
ECHO ([**2130-8-1**])
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anteroseptal akinesis,
apical akinesis, mid to distal anterior hypokinesis/akinesis and
basal inferior hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

CAROTID ULTRASOUND ([**2130-8-1**])
Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo man with hx of DM, CKD and HLD presents from OSH with
chest pain x3 days found to have STEMI (ST elevations in V1-V3),
brought for cardiac catheterization and found to have 3VD. No
stents were placed. An IABP was placed to improve cardiac output
in the setting of hypotension. The pt was medically managed with
Aspirin 325 mg daily, metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], rosuvastatin 40 mg
daily, and heparin gtt. Given severe 3VD, cardiac surgery was
contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation for coronary bypass grafting. No plavix
was given in anticipation for revascularization. The following
day the intra aortic balloon pump was successfully weaned and
removed with stable blood pressures. A small hematoma developed
in the right groin which slowly resolved, the hematocrit
remained stable. Coronary bypass workup was completed, however
surgery was delayed 2 days due to elevated Creatinine which
returned to baseline prior to procedure. The patient remained
chest pain free since cardiac catheterization with the exception
of fleeting chest pain on [**8-2**]. EKG showed findings similar to
presenting EKG. Chest pain spontaneously resolved without
intervation.
On [**8-3**] the patient was brought to the operating room for
coronary bypass grafting, please see the operative report for
details. In summary he had:
Coronary bypass grafting x4 with left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein
graft to the posterior left ventricular branch artery, obtuse
marginal artery, ramus intermedius artery.
His bypass time was 100 minutes with a crossclamp time of 89
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and post-operatively
was transferred to the cardiac surgery ICU.
Hemodynamically he was somewhat labile in the immediate post-op
period and was kept sedated on the day of surgery to provide
opportunity for transfusion/volume resuscitation and
stabilization. Attempted to wake patient on morning of POD1, at
that time he was very agitated and sedation was switched to
precedex without much effect. He  was weaned from the ventilator
but remained agitated and was not extubated until later in the
afternoon. Following extubation he required additional pulmonary
support, additionally his creatinine which was elevated post
ca
