CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from [**Hospital3 3765**] with
unstable angina.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient developed seven out
of ten chest pain this morning with radiation to his left arm
while showering.  The patient took Aspirin and three
sublingual Nitroglycerin without relief.  The patient then
went to [**Hospital3 3765**] without resolution of his chest pain
with the Nitroglycerin.  The patient also reports feeling
nauseous, diaphoretic and short of breath.  The patient
reports that over the last month, he has had intermittent
shortness of breath that he was recently seen by his primary
care physician for and the primary care physician felt that
he had evidence of congestive heart failure.  He was started
on Lasix.  The patient was also seen by his cardiologist,
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], within the last week who also felt that he was
developing congestive heart failure.  At [**Hospital3 3765**],
the patient was started on Heparin, intravenous
Nitroglycerin, given 2 milligrams of Morphine, 5 milligrams
of intravenous Lopressor and finally started on Integrelin.
The patient's pain was two out of ten at transfer but upon
arrival to [**Hospital1 69**] with a slight
increase in intravenous Nitroglycerin the patient was made
pain free.  The patient subsequently vomited a moderate
amount of bilious liquid.  The patient was admitted to the
PCU on Integrelin, Heparin, Nitroglycerin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheterization in [**2104**],
    showed two vessel disease with 60% left circumflex and
    90% right coronary artery.  Cardiac catheterization on
    [**11/2112**], showed an ejection fraction of 24% with 1+ mitral
    regurgitation, 80% mid right coronary artery, 40% right
    posterior descending artery, 30% mid circumflex and a 30%
    distal circumflex.  The patient had percutaneous
    transluminal coronary angioplasty with stent times two to
    the mid right coronary artery.  The patient was also
    noted to have moderate systolic and diastolic dysfunction
    with global hypokinesis.
2.  Carotid endarterectomy in [**2113**].
3.  Status post complete heart block with pacemaker
    placement.
4.  History of hypertension.
5.  History of high cholesterol.
6.  Left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram.

artery disease or diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 97.3, pulse 60, blood
pressure 112/61, respiratory rate 18, pulse oximetry 93% on
four liters nasal cannula.  In general, resting in bed,
alert, oriented in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat - The oropharynx is clear.  Anicteric sclera.
Moist mucous membranes.  Neck is supple with no jugular
venous distention.  Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  The lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities warm, 1+ pedal edema bilaterally, no femoral
bruits, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologic - alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, white count 9.8, hematocrit
40.6, platelets 218,000, 89% neutrophils.  Prothrombin time
16.6, partial thromboplastin time 150, INR 1.8.  Sodium 139,
potassium 4.3, chloride 102, bicarbonate 26, blood urea
nitrogen 23, creatinine 1.1, glucose 161.  CK was 96.  Chest
x-ray revealed cardiomegaly with no evidence of congestive
heart failure.  Electrocardiogram revealed a paced rhythm
with left bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease - The patient remained pain free
on Integrelin, Heparin and Nitroglycerin.  The patient ruled
in for myocardial infarction with positive troponin of 30
with peaked CK of 198 with positive MB fraction and index.

The patient was taken to cardiac catheterization on [**2118-1-17**],
and cardiac catheterization showed moderately elevated right
and left sided filling pressures with right atrium 9 mmHg,
wedge pressure of 25 mmHg and left ventricular end diastolic
pressure of 26 mmHg.  There was also moderate pulmonary
hypertension with a pulmonary artery pressure of 49/26.
Cardiac index was low at 1.9.  The patient had a 50% distal
stenosis of the left main and a 40% stenosis of an acute
marginal with patent stents in the right coronary artery.
The patient tolerated the cardiac catheterization well and
did not have any episodes of chest pain following the
catheterization.

The patient was placed on Aspirin and Lopressor and continued
on his Lipitor.  The patient's lipid profile was very good
with a LDL of less than 100.

2.  Congestive heart failure - The patient had evidence of
congestive heart failure on admission with an oxygen
requirement.  The patient was given two doses of Lasix with
good diuresis and improved shortness of breath.  The
patient's cardiac catheterization showed moderate right and
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.  The patient was
started on Zestril 5 milligrams and Lasix 20 milligrams on
discharge and will follow-up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
