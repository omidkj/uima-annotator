Admission Date:  [**2104-10-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-11-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2104-10-31**]       Sex:  M


HISTORY:  Baby [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname 45528**] is a 2935 gram product of a 37 week
gestation.  He was born to a 25 year old Gravida 4, Para 3,
now 4 woman.  Estimated date of confinement was [**2104-11-19**].
Prenatal screens are as follows:  Blood type O positive,
B surface antigen negative.  GBS positive.

OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:  Notable for a fracture of the coccyx
during the first vaginal delivery.  There was a previous
spontaneous vaginal delivery in [**2102**] at 36 weeks.  That
infant required a NICU stay for two days.  There was also a
cesarean section for breech presentation at 33-4/7 weeks in
Center NICU.

This pregnancy, however, has been uncomplicated and with a
planned repeat cesarean section.  The FLM was reportedly
immature on [**2104-10-29**], so cesarean section was performed on
[**2104-10-31**].

Apgars were 9 and 9.  The patient initially went to the
Newborn Nursery, however, at approximately four hours of
life, developed intermittent grunting, retracting and
tachypnea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, respiratory rate was in
the 80s with O2 saturations in room air of 95 to 98%.  The
blood pressure was 68/31 with a mean of 40.  Heart rate was
in the 140s to 170s.  Glucose on admission was 83.  Weight
2,935 [**Year (4 digits) **] which is the 50th percentile.  Head circumference
was 35 centimeters which is 75th percentile and length is 47
centimeters which is 50th percentile.  The patient was in
moderate respiratory distress with grunting, flaring and
retractions.

Although his initial oxygen saturation was fine in room air,
he subsequently developed an oxygen requirement.  His
saturations normalized in 200 cc. of 100% oxygen by nasal
cannula.  He has normal symmetric facies.  Anterior fontanel
was soft, open and flat.  His head is atraumatic.  The pupils
are equal, round and reactive to light.  There is bilateral
red reflex.  The palate is intact.  Neck is without masses or
defect.  The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac examination reveals S1, S2, regular rhythm, no
murmurs. Normal peripheral and femoral pulses.  He is warm
and well perfused.  The abdomen is soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  He is a
normal male with bilateral descended testes.  The anus is
patent and normally placed.  The hips are stable.  The
extremities are normal in appearance.  There is no edema.
There are no rashes.  The neurologic examination is
appropriate for gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  RESPIRATORY:  As mentioned above, the patient was placed
on nasal cannula with 200 cc. of 100% oxygen.  Over the
course of several days, this was weaned to room air.  On day
of life five he was placed on room air and remained there
subsequently.  As his oxygen requirements decreased, his
respiratory rate normalized as well.

Chest x-ray performed on admission did show a right lower
lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a soft murmur heard on
day of life one and intermittently since then, however, heart
size is normal on chest x-ray and his cardiac examination,
besides the intermittent soft murmur at the left sternal
border, was within normal limits.

3.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
initially maintained on intravenous fluids, however, as his
respiratory status normalized, he was allowed to p.o. feed.
Since that time, he has ad lib fed, both breast feeding but
also bottled breast milk as well as Prosobee formula. He has
been feeding well and his weight gain has been appropriate.
His most recent weight on [**2104-11-14**], is 2980 [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he
has regained his birth weight.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was started on Prosobee
since the siblings have a history of intolerance to other
formulas.

5.  HEMAT0LOGY:  The patient's hematocrit on admission was
49.  A subsequent hematocrit on day of life three was 46.
Initial platelet count was 185 and his subsequent platelet
count on day of life three was 241.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Given the clinical picture and chest
x-ray findings, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia.
The initial white count was 19 with 68 polys and 2 bands.  A
subsequent white count obtained on day of life three had a
total white count of 15 with also a benign differential.
Blood cultures were drawn times two and both have remained
sterile.

Given, however, the diagnosis of pneumonia, a lumbar
puncture was obtained with a white count of 50 with 2300 red
blood cells.  The differential was 44 polys, 1 band and 19
lymphs.  Protein was 81, glucose was 53 and the Gram stain
did show two plus polys.  These findings in the cerebrospinal
fluid were consistent with the diagnosis of meningitis and it
was for this reason that the CBC and blood cultures were
repeated on day of life three.

As mentioned, the two blood cultures drawn remain sterile as
did the cerebrospinal fluid.

The patient was treated with Ampicillin and gentamicin for a
14 day course.  Gentamicin levels were monitored and were
within normal limits.

7.  NEUROLOGY:  Lumbar puncture results as above.

8.  SENSORY:  1) Audiology-hearing screen was performed with
automated auditory brain stem responses and were normal
bilaterally.

9.  GENITOURINARY:  The patient was circumcised on
[**2104-11-13**].  There was some postoperative oozing but that
subsequently resolved.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   To home.

PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Hospital2 16663**]

is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37833**].

[**2104-11-11**].

2.  Meningitis.
3.  Status post circumcision.
