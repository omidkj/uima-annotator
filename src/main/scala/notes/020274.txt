Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is 70yo F w/ MMP including DM type II, HTN, and ESRD on HD,
who presents with episode of mental status changes, hypotension,
and hypoxia.  Pt was dialyzed as per her usual routine today,
then taken back home by EMS. Pt then reportedly had mental
status changes and agitation, and was taken back to OSH ED,
where she was found to have SBP in 60's and O2sat in 60's on RA.
 Pt was given 20mg etomidate, 10mg vecuronium and intubated for
hypoxic resp failure. She was given Zosyn 3.375mg for ?
diverticulits seen on CT abd.  She reportedly was ruled out for
PE at OSH, but this was a non-contrast CT.  Prior to leaving OSH
[**Name (NI) **], pt became hypertensive to the 200s and was started on a
nitro gtt.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS were: T99.8, HR75, BP187/66, RR12, 100% on
vent (AC650x12, PEEP5, fi02 100%).  Pt was given Vanc 1g x1,
10mg IV decadron, and a right femoral line was placed.

in a wheelchair, but able to do many ADLs in wheelchair (does
dishes, cleans herself).


Family History:

Physical Exam:
Vitals:
Gen:  Sedated, not responsive to voice, moving ext spontaneously
HEENT: Pupils reactive. Anicteric.
Neck:  No elev JVP
Cardio:  Regular, nml s1,s2. No murmurs.
Resp:  CTAB anteriorly.  no c/w/r.
Abd:  Soft, NTND. +BS
Ext:  R AKA. Ext cold to touch, pulses not palpable; able to
doppler R radial pulse.
Neuro:  Sedated, spont moving ext, not responsive to voice


Pertinent Results:
CTA chest prelim read: No PE; bilat large pleural effusions
increased in size; bilateral consolidations at bases ? PNA vs
atelectasis.

ECG [**2175-7-7**]:  Sinus rhythm.  Consider left atrial abnormality.
Extensive ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Since previous tracing, rate faster compared to the study of
[**2175-6-7**] which showed: Sinus bradycardia. P-R interval
prolongation. Early transition. Q-T interval prolongation with
ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2175-5-23**]
the Q-T interval is longer with more prominent ST-T wave
abnormalities. Clinical correlation is suggested.

EKG:  NSR 65. Nml axis.  QTc 510. <1mm ST depressions in
I,II,V5-V6 (V5-V6 new).  No TWIs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is 70 yo female with multiple medical problems including DM
type II, HTN, and ESRD on HD, who presented with episode of
mental status changes, hypotension, and hypoxic resp failure.
The patient was admitted to the MICU.

Hypoxic resp failure: most likely due to pulm edema [**1-26**] fluid
shifts s/p dialysis.  Differential on admission included PE,
PNA, and sepsis.  The patient had CT-angiogram that was negative
for pulmonary embolism, sputum cultures that only grew oral
flora and no growth on any of her blood cultures.  Of note the
patient had ECG's during this admission that were consistent
with prior ECGs without new findings and cardiac enzymes failed
to show an elevation of her Ck or CKMB.  The patient did have an
elevation in her troponin, but this low level elevation was to
be expected in a patient on chronic hemodialysis.  It remained
unclear what the etiology of her hypoxia was.  Nevertheless, the
patient's oxygen requirement resolved despite repleting fluids
and subsequent chest x-rays demonstrated resolution of the
patient's pulmonary congestion.

Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive on arrival at [**Hospital1 18**]
with SBPs in the 70s. Ddx includes overaggressive volume removal
at HD, sepsis, MI. Pt with elevated lactate on admission to 2.7.
 Sepsis, though intitially treated empirically, and MI were
ruled out based on negative blood cultures and reassuring
cardiac enzymes/ECG as above.  Volume repletion was sufficint to
restore normal blood pressures.  The patient never required
pressers.  She was given stress dose steroids based on an
insufficient response to a cortisol stimulation test.
Antihypertensives were intially held, but were restarted per her
outpatient regimen by the time of discharge.

The patient's altered mental status continued in the MICU and
after transfer to the floor.  It was characterized by a florid
delerium that was notable for auto discontinuation of her NG
tube and various IV lines.  She was combative with examiners and
would not respond to questions.  In the MICU she required soft
restraints on the upper extremities.  On the floor she continued
to behave erratically and a psychiatry consult was ordered.
They suggested 7.5mg TID Haldol standing with 5-10mg Haldol PRN
breakthrough.  The patient was very pleasant by her second day
([**2175-7-13**]) on the floor and no longer required Haldol.  She
occaisionally recieved ambien for sleep.  By the end of her
hospitalization she was refusing her physical therapy and was
threatening to leave AMA because of a persistent desire to go
home.  She refused discharge to rehab.  She was convinced to
stay from [**Date range (1) 20270**] to recieve physical therapy, even though
she was medically clear to go home.  She continued to scream at
night and refuse physical therapy.  She was ultimately
discharged home with increased services even though she was
advised that a rehabilitation facility would likely be in her
best interest.

On the [**2175-7-12**] a UTI was diagnosed - see labs above.
Mrs. [**Known lastname 18995**] was put on a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin.  She
was discharged with two days left and a prescription for her
antibiotics.
