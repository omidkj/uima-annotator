History of Present Illness:
This 54 yo woman with a history of obesity, asthma, anxiety,
kidney stones is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after diagnosis of
MG (+ MUSK Ab) with decreasing VC despite treatment with
steroids (perdnisone) for consideration of plasmapheresis. She
was hospitalized most recently at [**Hospital3 **] [**4-13**] (3rd hosp in 2
months), with respiratory failure/recurrent bronchitis/? ARDS.
She was given steroids for treatment of the ? ARDS, recurrent
dyspnea. This hospitalization was third decompensation, with
spirometry had restrictive physiology. This readmit was
reporting horizontal diploplia worse at the end of the day,
difficulty holding head up. Acetylcholine receptor ab neg, MuSK
+. Dynamic CT concerning for tracheomalacia. EMG neg (upper and
lower proximal muscles). Mestinon, IVIG started [**4-25**], prednisone
(60 daily), was improving over weekend, now declining again. VC
1L [**4-25**], down to 350cc [**4-27**] so intubated. Became hypotensive to
80's with intubation but improved with ivf (1L->102 SBP) thought
secondary to propofol. Of note, she had sinus tach at [**Hospital3 **]
early in her hospital course, ruled out for MI, TTE [**2-28**] EF 60%,
no valvular [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] started on metoprolol. She had a right
heart cath with PAP 39/11 (mean 25), with wedge 8. CTA neg for
PE. She was treated with BiPAP intermittently, with elevated
PCO2: 50-70, which was new. A neurology consult was placed and
recommended w/u for MG. Brain MRI reportedly negative, cervical
spine MRI with multi-level spinal stenosis.
On arrival she was intubated, AC 500/14/0.4/5. Able to nod no
pain, no thyroid disease, diet controlled type II DM, never had
anything like this before. She does nod yes to the
tube/ventilator helping her breathing.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 54 yo woman with asthma, recent pna, GERD, anxiety, and
respiratory failure with neruomuscular weakness with respiratory
failure and apparent tracheomalacia on dynamic CT.

1)Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **]: Patient transferred from OSH with low VC
suggestive of NM weakness, AChR-Ab - but + MuSK and recent
history of difficulty holding up head, keeping eyes open. EMG at
[**Hospital3 **] apparently normal. Treated there with ivig,
solumedrol, mestinon with no improvement.  Patient was admitted
to the MICU on [**2139-4-27**].  She had been intubated at the OSH for
respiratory failure.  She was seen by neurology and had a
plasmapheresis catheter placed.  Plasmapheresis was started
without complication.  The patient was also continued on
Mestinon and Prednisone.  She looked very comfortable and was
doing very well on the vent, with excellent RSBI, NIF, and VC so
the patient was extubated on [**5-1**].  She initially did well but
refused BiPAP because of severe anxiety and claustrophobia.  She
was unable to tolerate BiPAP despite significant doses of valium
and she became increasingly fatigued until she was using her
accessory muscles of respiration and retaining CO2 on her ABG.
For this reason it was decided to re-intubate her before she was
in even more severe distress.  The intubation was extremely
difficult.  She required very large doses of Fentanyl/Versed and
Propofol, and she was fiberscopically intubated.  There was
evidence of TBM as elucidated below.  She was comfortable on the
vent, alert and interactive although she remained quite anxious
and was put onto a fentanyl and versed gtt.  Her doses of
mestinon and prednisone were increased and she completed
sessions of plasmaphersis, with the last one on [**5-6**].  She was
extubated on [**5-8**] to supplemental oxygen by face mask went out
briefly to the neuro stepdown unit, but returned after 24 hours
for tachypnea. She was stable until [**5-17**], despite decreasing NIF
and VC, when she neuromuscularly decompensated, desatting to
55%. She was ambu-bagged and reintubated, this time, not
difficult. She did very well after this intubation, attributed
to myasthenic crisis once again, but the decision was made,
given the prolonged course of this episode, to undergo
trach/peg, which occurred on [**5-22**] without complication. She also
had an additional 5 days of IVIG. She is now weaned to trach
mask. VC and nif should continue to be monitored for signs that
the patient is tiring. Speech and swallow eval on [**5-24**] cleared
the patient for regular diet. Balloon is down and patient
talking with Passy-Muir valve in place.

#) MG- refer to crisis as above. Neurology following, patient on
cellcept, mestinon and prednisone. Has follow up appt on [**2139-6-2**]
at 9:30am with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 557**]/Zarvin.

2)Asthma: There was some concern that this might have been a
misdiagnosis in the setting of undiagnosed TBM and Myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) **].  Patient's PFT's are unknown, but she did have evidence
of bronchospasm during her fiberoptic intubation.  Her Singulair
and Advair were discontinued, and patient was maintained on
albuterol and  ipratropium nebs.  On [**5-8**] her albuterol was
changed to Xopinex.  She initially received QVAR from [**Date range (1) 43604**],
but this was discontinued.

3)Tracheomalacia: Patient had evidence of TBM on her chest VT
performed at the OSH.  During her fiberoptic re-intubation on
[**5-1**] she was noted to have moderate-severe TBM.  A repeat chest
CT was performed which showed only moderate TBM so the patient
had another fiberoptic bronchoscopy on [**5-7**] which showed
moderate to severe TBM.  She was taken to the OR on [**5-7**] and had
a rigid bronchoscopy with silicon stent placement.  She was
started on Mucinex, lidocaine nebulizers, and codeine IV.  She
was extubated on [**5-8**]. Patient should follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] in IP.

4)Urinary tract infection: Patient grew Citrobacter in urine.
Pansensitive except for Bactrim. Likely foley related. Started
on Ceftriaxone on [**5-8**] for 7 day course. Limited by antibiotic
regimen (like Cipro) since it can exacerbate her underlying
neurological disorder.

5)Sinus tachycardia: During this admission patient has been in
and out of sinus tachycardia with elevations to 160. Per
patient, this is has been an ongoing issue. Likely autonomic
