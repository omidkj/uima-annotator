Chief Complaint:
GI bleed.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Noninvasive ventilation.

History of Present Illness:
80yo F with PMHx of COPD, Atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
ulcerative colitis, s/p colon resection who presented from OSH
after acute presentation of BRBPR.
The patient reports that she had been feeling well all day being
able to participate in her PT course during the day. Around [**2051**]
in the evening yesterday, the patient had to use the bathroom to
have a BM. The patient reports that at this time, she passed
BRBPR. The patient denies abdominal pain associated with the
episode or prior to or after the episode. She denies acute onset
of nausea or vomiting associated wtih the episode, reporting
that she does have nausea at times for other reasons. She denies
recent medication changes to her UC medications. She denies a
history of melena or hematochezia prior to this episode of
BRBPR.

She reports a recent hospitalization but she is unable to
remember the details of this recent hospitalization. Discharge
summary included in the patient's paperwork showed that she was
hospitalized for COPD exacerbation on [**2143-7-2**].
She was transferred to the OSH for evaluation of BRBPR. The
patient was noted to have HCT of 23.7 at the OSH ED. The patient
underwent NG lavage and was negative. She was found to have INR
of 3.8 and was given Vitamin K and FFP. R femoral line placed in
the OSH ED.

In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient initially has SBP 68 which
increased to 92. She was initially on vassopressin, which was
then weaned in the ED. The patient receieved 2 units of pRBCs in
the ED, thus receiving a total of 7 units of pRBCs between [**Hospital1 18**]
ED and OSH ED.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient reports that her breathing
is improved since starting positive pressure ventilation.

Information obtained from OSH records:
--[**2136-6-29**] PFT's: FEV1 51%, FVC/FEV1 42%, total lung capacity
129, diffusion 81, minimum improvement with bronchodilators
--[**2139-5-29**] colonoscopy record: granularity of the mucosa,
appeared to have flat ?adenomatous polyps, anastomasosis at

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo female with history of steroid and oxygen dependent COPD,
Atrial fibrillation recently started on coumadin, and Crohn's
disease s/p colon resection who presented from OSH after acute
presentation of BRBPR.

# BRBPR: Patient with acute onset of BRBPR thought to be oozing
from angiodysplasia or diverticular bleed in the setting of full
strength aspirin and warfarin with supratherapeutic INR.  She
initially required pressors, 7 units of pRBC, and 2 units of
FFP.  She did not have any further BRBPR here at [**Hospital1 18**].  Her
hematocrit was trended and normalized at 37.  Her warfarin and
aspirin were held and her INR normalized.  Given her end stage
COPD, and the risk of procedure with further bleeding, her
warfarin was stopped and she was only resumed on an aspirin 81mg
daily.

# End Stage COPD: Patient presented with dyspnea worse than
baseline. She has a history of steroid and oxygen dependent COPD
and was recently discharged for a COPD exacerbation. Her
prednisone was increased to 60mg daily and she was continued on
nebs.  She was continued on Bipap at night and intermittently
during the day per her home baseline.  Prior to transfer to the
floor, she was on a 4L NC.  The degree of her end stage COPD was
discussed with her and her family.

# Atrial fibrillation: CHADS2 of 3.  Her warfarin was
discontinued given the risk of further bleeding and the need for
procedure likely requiring intubation that may not be
reversible.  The risk of embolic event off of warfarin was
discussed with the patient and family.  She was continued on
digoxin for rate control during her stay.  Her digoxin was
decreased to decrease risk of toxicity.  Her verapamil was
increased to 180mg SR daily given history of SVT/ a-fib with
RVR.   Cont. on verapamil, digoxin, as noted in discharge
medications.  NO coumadin.  Please re-evaluate need for
increased verapamil as an outpatient.
