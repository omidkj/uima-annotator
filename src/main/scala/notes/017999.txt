Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3645**]
Chief Complaint:
EtOH withdrawal, C-spine fractures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
posterior cervical fusion; [**2166-7-27**]
PEG/trach [**2166-8-12**]

History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with a history of EtOH abuse and neck arthritis who
was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cervical spine fractures
s/p two falls over past 2 days. Pt reported falling forward onto
his forehead on 2 days ago and falling backward onto his neck in
his bathtub yesterday with loss consciousness both times but did
not seek medical attention. This AM, he presented to the [**Hospital 28941**] ED for neck pain and was found to have odontoid and C4
fractures; he was transferred here for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.7, HR 106, BP 143/94, O2sat 96%
on RA. Pt alert and oriented with intact neurologic exam. Mildly
wheezy so given albuterol and ipratropium nebs x 2. Patient was
given morphine 2mg x 1 and 4mg x 2 for pain control. Seen by
Ortho-Spine who thought his C-spine fracture may have been acute
on chronic per review of OSH CT C-spine; recommended CT T- and
L- spine with plan for surgery. In the meantime, pt reported
feeling anxious and was given lorazepam 2mg IV per request.
There was subsequently concern for EtOH withdrawal given
restlessness, tachycardia to 107, and SBP 180s-200s. Pt admitted
to drinking 1 quart of vodka nightly. Given valium 10mg IV x 2.
Started on banana bag. Serum and urine tox screens pending.
Admitted to MICU for EtOH withdrawal. On transfer, VS: T 97.9,
HR 101, BP 153/48, RR 16, O2sat 100% NRB.
.
On the floor, pt denies hallucinations or anxiety. No neck or
back pain. Per his sister, his last known drink was Thursday
night. No h/o EtOH withdrawal in past ("never off alcohol long
enough"), seizure disorder, psych disorder. No h/o CAD or CVA.
No h/o neck fracture.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills. Denies headache, sinus. Denied cough,
shortness of breath. Denied chest pain. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.

OSH [**2166-7-26**] CT head: No acute intracranial pathological
process.
.
OSH [**2166-7-26**] CT c-spine:
1. Transverse, type 2 odontoid fracture, with posterior
displacement of the C1/odontoid complex and the body of C2 at
approximately 7 mm. While the fracture line appears somewhat
corticated, making this of uncertain chronicity in the lack of
prior comparisons, prevertebral soft tissue swelling suggests an
element of acute injury.
2. Obliquely oriented fracture through the body of C4, with
extension into
the left lamina. There is also fracture of anterior bridging
osteophytic complex at C3-C4 level. There is exaggerated
lordotic curvature and distraction of fracture line, and some
retropulsion of the superior fracture fragment into the canal.
There is again prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this level.
3. Diffuse degenerative change, with profuse anterior bridging
osteophytes
and disc osteophyte complexes causing mild-to-moderate canal
stenosis. This does predispose patient to cord injury, and MRI
of the cervical spine is recommended to exclude ligamentous
involvement and cord contusion.
Addendum: Upon re-examination of the axial sections, the
epidural hemorrhage may be longitudinally more extensive than
localized at C3/4, and likely involves more cephalad segments.
However, it is still likely a relatively thin rind in shape. MR
scanning would be helpful in more detailed imaging of the cord
and dural margins.

IMAGING:.
[**7-25**]: Transverse, type 2 odontoid fracture, with posterior
displacement of the C1/odontoid complex and the body of C2 at
approximately 7 mm. Uncertain chronicity. Obliquely oriented
fracture through the body of C4, with extension into the left
lamina. There is also fracture of anterior bridging osteophytic
complex at C3-C4 level. There is exaggerated lordotic curvature
and distraction of fracture line, and some retropulsion of the
superior fracture
fragment into the canal.
[**7-29**]: CXR bibasilar atelectasis and bilar pleural effusion
[**7-30**]: CXR collapse RML, RLL
[**8-1**] (x2): CXR atelectasis in RLL, retrocardiac, no signs of new
PNA, ? small R pleural effusion
[**8-3**]: MRI: No acute infarct seen. Post-traumatic changes seen in
the
cervical spine on the sagittal images
[**8-4**]: Right lower lobe is still collapsed. Right upper lobe and
left lung are clear. Heart size normal.
[**8-13**] RUE US: near occlusive clot in right subclavian, axillary,
and brachial veins
[**8-14**]: Left subclavian tip is in lower SVC. Tracheostomy tip is
in standard position. Right PICC line is not visualized.
Bibasilar opacities due to small bilateral pleural effusions and
atelectasis are greater on the right side and unchanged. There
is no pneumothorax.
[**8-17**] CXR: S/p trach. interval improved aeration in the R lower
lung but there still continues to be right lower lobe volume
loss. There are small b pleural effusions.
[**8-18**] CXR: p
[**8-18**] CT abd/pelvis: Moderate amount of complex fluid (ie
hemorrage) within the intraperitoneal compartment, with the
largest collections located in the deep pelvis, paracolic
gutters, perihepatic in [**L
