Heart: RRR w/ [**4-14**] holosystolic murmur
Abd: Soft, NT/ND, +BS
Ext: Warm, well-perfused with edema, right groin hematoma
Neuro: MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**9-6**] CXR: There is continued evidence of mild pulmonary vascular
congestion and small pleural effusions. A calcified granuloma is
again demonstrated on the left. The patient is status post
median sternotomy and MVR. Mediastinal structures are unchanged.
A right internal jugular catheter has been removed. There is no
other significant interval change
[**8-23**] Chest CT: 1. Diffuse atherosclerotic mural calcifications
involving the aortic arch and descending aorta. The ascending
aorta is free of mural calcifications. 2. Calcified hilar lymph
nodes and granulomas within the lungs and spleen are consistent
with prior granulomatous infection. 3. Moderate centrilobular
emphysema. 4. Diffuse interstitial lung disease, with features
suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis. Further evaluation with high-
resolution CT of the chest is recommended if clinically
indicated. 5. Small hiatal hernia.
[**8-24**] Echo: The left atrium is markedly dilated. A small secundum
atrial septal defect is present. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate/severe mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 4469**] was transferred from OSH for
further care. He was appropriately worked-up in the usual
pre-operative manner. On [**8-24**] he was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a mitral valve replacement. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Pt was weaned from
Inotropes by post-op day two. He required post-op blood
transfusion and aggressive pulmonary toilet. Chest tubes were
removed per protocol. On post-op day two cardiology/EP was
consulted secondary to possible complete heart block/atrial
fibrillation. Pt developed some DT's and was disoriented on
post-op day three which was treated with Ativan and Haldol. On
post-op day three and four amiodarone and heparin was started.
He eventually was started on Coumadin with Heparin as a bridge
until INR was therapeutic. Epicardial pacing wires were removed
per protocol. On post-op day four he had BRBPR and GI were
consulted. Per pt, he has had chronic bleeding per rectum
secondary to radiation. Pt remained in the CSRU while he was
lethargic and being treated for his heart block/afib. On post-op
day seven he appeared stable and was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. While on the floor, Mr. [**Known lastname 4469**]
continued to have elevated WBC. Blood and urine cultures were
taken and he was found to have a UTI (antibiotics started). He
was also found to have a rash on his chest and abdomen which
slowly improved. Over the next several days his INR trended up
while receiving Coumadin for his Atrial Fibrillation. Also had
bump in his creatinine which slowly came down prior to
discharge. During his post-op course he worked with physical
therapy for strength and mobility. His INR was eventually
therapeutic on post-op day fourteen and he appeared stable for
discharge to rehab facility with the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
