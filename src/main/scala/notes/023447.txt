CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for elevated liver
function tests.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 78-year-old
woman with complicated recent medical history beginning with
cholecystectomy transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] from [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation of elevated liver function
tests.  The patient had a fall on [**3-29**] leading to a hip
fracture and repaired, but "migrated" and she had a
hemiarthroplasty.  This was complicated by wound infection
which grew stenotrophomonas and MRSA.  Removal of hardware
on [**2142-10-10**].  She was getting ready to go to rehab, but
be elevated.  A CT Scan of the abdomen showed sludge in the
gallbladder.  She had an ERCP at [**Hospital1 190**] as an outpatient on [**11-9**] which showed sludge
positive and she had a sphincterotomy.  There was no evidence
of cholangitis.  She had an open cholecystectomy and J tube
placement at [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-12**].  Pathology showed "chronic
cholecystitis".  The patient with persistent fevers and
elevated LFTs sent back to [**Hospital1 188**] for evaluation of ERCP.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  RESPIRATORY:  On [**11-18**], Anesthesia was called at 9
o'clock for elective intubation secondary to medical
necessity.  She was noted to have worsening
oxygenation and esophageal balloon, measured pleural pressure
at 1016 and it was felt that PEEP should be increased because
it was likely a negative transpulmonary pressure without
alveolar hypoventilation. With increased PEEP her oxygen
imprved.

The patient was treated for a small left lower lobe
pneumonia.  Oxygenation and ventilation were maintained
followed ABGs.  An A line was in place.  The patient was
fully weaned down to C-PAP pressure support of 10 and 5 on
fio2 of 40% and remained stable.  Was noted that her tidal
volumes and oxygen saturations both dropped when the pressure
support was dropped to 5.  It was felt that given her mental
status and secretions as well as her volume status, that she
likely would not be able to be extubated in the near future,
therefore there is a planned tracheostomy for [**2141-12-3**].

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient came in what appeared to be
sepsis given her hypotension, fever, tachycardia and
increased white count with left shift.  She quickly required
pressure support of her blood pressure.  Given her tender
right abdomen, elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin as
well as transaminases, it was felt that abdominal source was
most likely, however other sources, in particular,
hepatobiliary, however other sources such as her left hip and
vascular, urinary, other GI or pulmonary, could not be
ruled out.  She was therefore started broad antibiotics and
volume resuscitation.  She was started on Vancomycin and
Imipenem.

Originally, she was seen by the Biliary Service and taken to
ERCP to look for a possible source, but all that was found
was previous sphincterotomy and mild
nonspecific biliary dilation, previous cholecystectomy.  No
evidence of stones or sludge on balloon sweep.  Cultures were
drawn.  It was considered to start the patient on
anticoagulation,  however she had blood stool so that was not
done.  Her blood pressure was supported with Levophed and
Vasopressor as well as aggressive volume resuscitation.
Neo-Synephrine was added and a cortisol stem test was
performed and before results were done, Hydrocortisone stress
doses were empirically added.

On [**11-19**], a CT Scan of the abdomen was performed which showed
consolidation left posterior lung base, tiny bilateral
pleural effusions.  Liver, spleen, adrenal, pancreas and
kidneys unremarkable.  There was a small amount of fluid
surrounding the liver.  There was a small amount of fluid
around the spleen.  No hydronephrosis.  No nephrolithiasis.
No gallbladder.  Intraluminal bowel loop unremarkable, no
free air. Her left lower quadrant sigmoid was
mildly distended.  Colon at level of splenic flexure, not
completed distended and demonstrates mild bowel wall
thickening and extended into the upper
pelvis.  Surgical wire around left proximal femur.  Femur
head is dislocated posteriorly and superiorly. Comminuted
fracture of left femoral head.  Fluid filled vestibular space
and extends laterally into the soft tissue.

Surgery was also consulted and followed the patient and given
these findings, performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy.  The patient
had been started on Flagyl to cover presumptively for
Clostridium difficile.  Rigid sigmoidoscopy showed large
stool obscuring the muc
