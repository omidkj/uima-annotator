Admission Date:  [**2183-6-28**]     Discharge Date:  [**2183-7-1**]

Date of Birth:   [**2118-9-24**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Coronary, Critical Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
female smoker with past medical history of three vessel
disease status post catheterization with LAD ramus stent in
[**2182**] who presents with 8/10 chest pain with radiation to her
right arm at 2 p.m. on the day of admission.  The patient
initially thought the pain was her gastroesophageal reflux
disease but the pain grew in intensity and did not remit.
The patient reported to the [**Hospital3 2358**] where she was noted
to have ST elevations in her inferior leads.  The patient was
taken to the [**Hospital1 69**] cath lab
where she was found to have a diffusely diseased proximal
RCA, 100% mid RCA lesion which was stented times two with 0
residual stenosis.  She also had a terminal RCA lesion that
was ballooned with a loss of a small posterolateral branch
distally that was not crossed or stented.  The patient was
also noted to have 50% LAD, 100% intermedius that was
previously stented and a 50% mid circumflex stenosis.  The
patient had chest pain during the procedure when the balloon
was inflated but was admitted to the CCU with no chest pain
or other symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, COPD, GERD, migraines, irritable bowel
syndrome, and cervical spondylosis with mild peripheral
neuropathy.  The patient's outpatient medications were
Aspirin, Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Albuterol, Pulmicort, Serevent
and Lipitor 50 mg q day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was alert and oriented
times three.  She was in no acute distress.  She was a
moderately obese lady.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light, extraocular movements intact, oropharynx
was clear and mucus membranes were moist.  Cardiovascular
exam, patient had regular rate, normal S1, normal S2, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary exam, patient had
bilateral breath sounds in all lung fields with diffuse end
expiratory wheezes throughout.  Abdominal exam was soft,
obese, tender to deep palpation diffusely, with positive
active bowel sounds.  Extremities, the patient had doppler
positive pulses bilaterally in her lower extremities with 2+
capillary refill and no bruit, hematoma or bleeding from her
right groin cath site.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10, hemoglobin 12.2,
hematocrit 33.4, platelet count 240,000, sodium 138,
potassium 4.4, chloride 104, CO2 23, BUN 11, creatinine .6,
glucose 120, ALT 19, AST 109, CK was initially 1458 with a CK
MB of 223 and an index of 15.3 that was then increased to
1720 for the CK with a CK MB of 183 and an index of 10.6.
Calcium was 8.8, phosphorus 4.4, magnesium 1.8.  Patient's
EKG from admission showed non diagnostic Q waves in leads 2,
3 and AVF with ST wave flattening in lead 2 and more
prominent T wave inversion in lead 3 and new T wave inversion
in lead AVF compared to tracing from [**2182-1-10**].  The
patient had an echocardiogram done on [**2183-6-30**] that showed a
normal left atrium, normal left ventricle with mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction and resting regional
wall motion abnormalities that include inferior akinesis with
inferolateral and inferoseptal hypokinesis, normal aortic
valve leaflets, no aortic regurg, mild 1+ mitral
regurgitation and normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CVS:  A) Coronary artery disease - the patient's right
coronary artery was stented and she was started on Integrilin
for 18 hours, given Plavix for a 30 day regimen and was
instructed to take Aspirin each day.  The patient had
significant three vessel disease and patient was instructed
to follow-up with her primary cardiologist to discuss future
management of her heart disease.  The patient was already on
Lipitor 50 mg q day.  This was increased to 80 mg q day due
to the results of a lipid profile that had been done on [**6-25**]
that showed an LDL of 115, triglycerides 156 and HDL of 55.
Additionally the patient's liver tests were checked which
were within normal limits and indicated that the patient
could tolerate a higher dose of Lipitor.  The singular most
important aspect of the patient's post MI care is risk factor
reduction with smoking cessation.  The patient was interested
in smoking cessation, however, she declined pharmacological
treatment at this time.  The patient agreed to quit smoking
when she left the hospital.  B) Pump - the patient had an
ejection fraction of 45% on her previous catheterization in
[**2182-1-10**] and her most recent echocardiogram done on [**6-30**]
during this hospitalization showed the same ejection fraction
of 45% with new left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  A
stress echocardiogram in [**3-15**] weeks may prove useful in
identifying the patient's long-term effect of this MI.
C) Rhythm - the patient had an episode of bradycardia during
her catheterization which responded to Atropine.  She had no
other dysrhythmia throughout her hospitalization and she was
monitored on telemetry throughout her hospitalization.

The patient was started on a very low dose of Lisinopril
towards the end of her hospitalization.  A higher dose would
be beneficial for this patient and should be titrated up as
tolerated at her next follow-up appointment.  We were not
able to advance Lisinopril to 5 mg as we would have hoped due
to the patient's low normal blood pressure which ranged from
the low 90's to low 100's in systolic.

2.  Pulmonary:  A) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -
patient was maintained on most of her inhalers during her
hospitalization, however, her Salmeterol and Albuterol were
held due to her high normal heart rate after her MI.  The
patient was able to be weaned easily off of two liters of
oxygen to room air, however, she had troubling lung exam
throughout her hospitalization with diffuse end expiratory
crackles.  The patient reports that she is short of breath at
baseline from her COPD and a recent chest CT showed diffuse
emphysematous changes with some stable pulmonary nodules.
Additionally, the patient's PFTs from last year showed a mild
obstructive pattern and the patient was instructed to restart
her outpatient inhaler regimen when she was discharged from
the hospital.

3.  Renal:  The patient had no issues.  BUN and creatinine
were stable despite the large dye load during her
catheterization.

4.  Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  The patient was
instructed to start a part healthy diet and she was advised
that following a low sugar diabetic diet may be an important
aspect of her future dietary regimen.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient had a mildly elevated hemoglobin
A1C which was 6.8 done on [**6-25**].  The patient likely has a
degree of insulin resistance in the early stages of diabetes
mellitus.  Her glucoses were ranging from 100 to 120
throughout her hospitalization, however, an improved diet and
exercise regimen would likely benefit this patient.

6.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was given Protonix throughout
her hospitalization for peptic ulcer prevention and for her
gastroesophageal reflux disease.  The patient was instructed
to restart her outpatient medications for her
gastroesophageal reflux disease.  The patient was given
Docusate for constipation throughout her hospitalization.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient was discharged on Lipitor
80 mg q day, Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], Lisinopril 2.5 mg q day,
Plavix 75 mg q day for 27 days, Aspirin 325 mg q day,
outpatient inhalers.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.  The patient was discharged home.
