History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 78M well known to this service having undergone an
ex-lap, sigmoid colectomy, end colostomy & [**Doctor Last Name 3379**] procedure
on [**2140-12-25**] for perforated diverticulitis and associated sepsis.
 His hospital course included a week-long ICU course for
hypotension, respiratory failure, renal failure.  His organ
failure resolved and he was ultimately discharged from the floor
to rehab on POD 11 tolerating regular food with NJ TF and ostomy
output. Cr was back at baseline (2.2).

Had been doing reasonably well at rehab.  However, on [**2141-1-12**]
HCT 25.2 from 32 on [**2141-1-9**]. Guaiac +, tranfused 2U PRBCs, INR
2.34 on coumadin 2, Cr 2.6 (from 1.32 on [**2141-1-9**]).  Started
colchicine for joint pain.

[**2141-1-13**] HCT 29.  No gross bleeding.  Started prednisome 30 on
[**1-14**] for gout flare unresponsive to colchicine.  [**1-16**] Cr fond
to be 3.52 from 2.86.  Colchicine & lasix were stopped.  He was
started on IVF.

Developed BRB from his colostomy on [**2141-1-17**].  INR was 1.9 at
the time (on coumadin for afib).  He was given 2U FFP, vit K IV,
and 2U PRBCs. EGD on [**2141-1-18**] at [**Hospital1 **]: mild gastritis,
duodenal ulcer with deep crater (5cm) with bleeding vessel.
Injected with Epi (3cc) and bipolar cautery perofrmed. Bx were
taken for H Pylori.  He was started on a protonix gtt &
octreotide gtt along with carafate.  Prednisone was stopped.

Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] today for further care.  Pt has abdominal
"discomfort". No N/V. + Melena.  Has been hemodynamically
stable.

EGD [**2141-1-19**]:
A single crate, oozing, 2X5 cm ulcer was found in the
post-duodenal bulb. The ulcer was clearly demarcated and has
gritty base that cound not hold the endoclip. Active bleeding
was seen through the base of ulcer. During the procedure,
approximately 100 cc blood lost. however, pt is hemodynamic
stable. 4 1 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were applied for
hemostasis with partial success. Three endoclips were
unsuccessfully applied to the the ulcer at post-duodenal bulb
for the purpose of hemostasis.

IR coil embolization [**2141-1-19**]:
Successful and uncomplicated prophylactic gastroduodenal artery
embolization for bleeding duodenal ulcer (as seen on endoscopy)
using a Hilal coils ranging from 3 mm x 3 cm, 4 mm x 4 cm and 6
mm x 6 cm (total of eight coils).

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2141-2-1**]:
There is small-to-moderate amount of ascites. A JP drain is
noted in the right abdomen.  There is extensive mesenteric fat
stranding and edema, without evidence of large fluid collections
or abscess formation. The gastrojejunostomy site is visualized;
however, its patency cannot be assessed due to lack of contrast.
 The oral contrast given through J-tube is visualized throughout
small and large bowel and within the colostomy bag, there is no
evidence of an obstruction.  No extraluminal contrast.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2141-2-9**]:
The patient is with Roux-en-Y bypass. There is normal
opacification of the stomach and the jejunostomy, without
evidence for active leak. There is no evidence of bowel
obstruction. A surgical drain is seen in the right upper abdomen
terminating in the sub-diaphragmatic region.  There is diffuse
mesenteric fat stranding and moderate amount of simple ascites
seen throughout the abdomen and pelvis, stable since the prior
study.  No focal fluid collections or abscesses are detected.
There is no intra-abdominal free air. Subcutaneous air at the
level of the incision site likely relates to the recent
procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**1-19**]: Admitted to SICU, underwent EGD and IR embolization of
GDA, transfused 5u PRBC.
[**1-20**]: Hct stable - no transfusions since IR.  Remained
intubated.
[**1-21**]: Extubation not attempted as pt noted to be having copious
secretions.  TFs started.
[**1-22**]: Extubated. Lasix 60mg IV x 1.
[**1-24**]: To OR for exploratory laparotomy, antrectomy, roux-en-Y
gastroJ, feeding jejunostomy, subtotal chole and anastamosis of
transected CBD.  Intubated post-op.  Bronched for L lung
collapse and desaturations.  JP drain to RUQ.
[**1-26**]: Repeat ECHO.  Cc:cc repletions d/c'd and IVF rate
decreased.  Standing albumin started w/ subsequent successful
weaning of pressor requirement.
[**1-29**]: TF increased ([**2-5**] to 3/4 strength).  Negative fluid
balance secondary to JP output draining bilious succus, likely
from duodenal stump leak.
[**2-5**]: JP drainage sent for bili (7.9) and amylase (61,700).
[**2-6**]: Adjusted TF.
[**2-7**]: Transferred to floor.
[**2-9**]: Pt readmitted to SICU for mental status changes.  NGT
placed by primary team.  CT abdomen/pelvis.
[**2-10**]: Given 1 FFP in preparation for PTC placement, unable to get
done in IR, postponed to [**2-11**]. Getting albumin boluses for low
uop.
[**2-11**]: Given 2U FFP prior to PTC placement and 3U FFP during
procedure.  Patient was intubated in IR. They were unable to
place drain in bile ducts.  Received 2U PRBC. Kept intubated
post-procedure on propofol and neo.  Oliguric with metabolic
acidosis with lactate of 6.5. Started on bicarb gtt and
refeeding JP output through J-tube.
[**2-12**]: Hypotensive, requiring second pressor.  Anuric with FeNa 6%
suggesting ATN.  Failed [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test suggesting functional
adrenal insufficiency.
[**2-13**]: Hypotensive, requiring third pressor.  Family meeting was
held and patient rendered CMO.  Expired.
