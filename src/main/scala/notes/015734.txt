HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old
female with a complex medical history who was initially
admitted to the Medicine Department complaining of an episode
of hematemesis and recurrent diarrhea.  The patient has a
remote history of gastric ulcers in the [**2075**], which were
cauterized at [**Hospital6 1129**] with a recent
negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy [**4-28**], and negative
colonoscopy in [**7-28**], with the exception of a benign sigmoid
polyp that was removed.  She was seen at an outside hospital
four days prior to admission after eating a meal at
[**Last Name (un) 71619**], when she subsequently developed abdominal pain
following the meal.  She was complaining of four days of
vomiting with bilateral lower quadrant pain, watery diarrhea,
low grade subjective fevers, chills, nausea and unable to
tolerate p.o. and generalized weakness.  Her symptoms had
waxed and waned but persisted.  At 1:00 p.m. on the day of
admission, she had a strange feeling in her mouth with some
nausea, a watery bowel movement, denies blood, and then
vomited approximately one cup of fluid laced in blood.  In
the Emergency Department, lavage was negative.  Her
hematocrit was stable.  She was guaiac negative.  The patient
denied any recent travel, change in her normal dietary
habits.  She denies any sick contacts, bright red blood per
rectum, odynophagia, changes in her vision, chest pain,
palpitations, joint swelling.  Review of systems is
essentially benign.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies tobacco, alcohol abuse
and lives at home with her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission vital signs revealed
temperature 98.4, heart rate 73, blood pressure 114/79,
respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 91% in room air to
96%.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - The
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation. She was anicteric.  She has dry mucous
membranes.  The neck was supple.  She has a right 1.5
centimeter cervical lymph node that was palpable, nontender
and mobile.  Pulmonary examination is clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination - regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no audible murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  The abdomen is obese, bowel sounds are present,
diffusely tender, no rebound, no guarding.  She was guaiac
negative.  Bilateral pitting edema.  Neurologically, the
patient was awake, alert and oriented times three.
Additionally, on her extremity examination, it was noted that
she had a right knee contusion.  She had right ankle swelling
and she had an area on the lateral aspect of her right shin
that was warm, erythematous and tender.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, sodium 140, potassium 4.8,
chloride 100, bicarbonate 29, blood urea nitrogen 16,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 90.  White blood cell count was 5.6,
hematocrit 41.9, platelet count 201,000.  Differential showed
63% neutrophils, 27 lymphocytes, 8.9 monocytes, 0.4
eosinophils, 0.4 bands.  ALT 15, AST 33.  Amylase was 24,
lipase 18, total bilirubin 1.6.  Albumin was 4.4.

CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of diverticulitis, no
findings to explain right lower quadrant pain or hematemesis.
No intra-abdominal masses.  No bowel obstruction.  Chest
x-ray showed no congestive heart failure, masses or
pneumonia.

Her [**7-28**], colonoscopy reported negative except for a benign
distal polyp.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy [**4-28**], showed small
hiatal hernia, otherwise normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy to
the second part of the duodenum.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 61 year old female with a past
medical history significant for lower extremity edema and
venous stasis, chronic cellulitis, and multiple other medical
problems, who initially presented for a reported episode of
hematemesis and diarrhea but was subsequently found to have a
rapidly progressing right lower extremity cellulitis.

1.  Right lower extremity cellulitis - The patient initially
complained of some warmth and pain and tenderness on her
right lower extremity, however, she was unable to distinguish
between recent trauma where she fell and struck her right
knee and a recent foot/ankle fracture that occurred four to
six weeks ago.  However, approximately eighteen hours
following admission, the patient developed a fever to 104 and
became markedly hypotensive down into the 60s.  The patient
reports baseline pressures in the low 90s to low 100s,
however, this was clearly outside her normal range.  The area
of erythema, redness, warmth and tenderness on her right
lower leg was rapidly progressing.  It was outlined and was
noticed now to have increased from an area of approximately
4.0 by 4.0 inches to include the entire lower leg from the
ankle up to above the knee.  As a result of the rapidly
spreading cellulitis, there was some concern that she might
have a deep tissue infection and surgery was consulted.
Surgery initially scheduled her for the operating room,
however, she was hemodynamically unstable and it was decided
to do a bedside incision and drainage which subsequently grew
Pasteurella.  The patient was initially treated on the floor,
give intravenous fluids and started on a Dopamine drip.  It
should be noted that the patient had a severe reaction to the
Dopamine drip while the drip was successful in maintaining
her blood pressure prior to her transfer to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  She reported severe head pain, nausea,
and one episode of emesis.  As a result of the patient
becoming septic, she was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit where she received Intensive Care Unit level care.  She
was maintained in the Intensive Care Unit from [**2118-9-20**], to
[**2118-9-25**], a total of five days, being primarily treated for
hypotension associated with a Pasteurella cellulitis and
sepsis.  Due to her multiple drug allergies, she was
initially started on Vancomycin and Levaquin after failing an
initial course of Clindamycin which she had used in the past
to treat prior cellulitic infections.  She was given pressors
in the Intensive Care Unit and subsequently transferred out
of the unit on [**2118-9-25**].  Her cellulitis had since resolved
on the shin, however, she does have a residual right
pretibial and suprapatellar abscess.  The knee joint was
tapped which was found to be negative.  There was no evidence
of a joint effusion or infection.  On [**2118-9-29**], the patient
had ultrasound guided aspiration of the joint which
subsequently was negative, however, this was after the
patient had received multiple day course of antibiotics,
approximately ten days.

In terms of studies, the patient had a magnetic resonance
scan which showed a suprapatellar and pretibial abscess. No
evidence of effusion.  She had a CT of the leg which did not
show evidence of a necrotizing fasciitis, but rather showed
soft tissue infection and cellulitis. The patient was treated
on intravenous Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin and subsequently
will be discharged on o
