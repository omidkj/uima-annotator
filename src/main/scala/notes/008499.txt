Brief Hospital Course:
1.  NEURO-
After IV t-PA was given, the patient was noted to be moving her
extremities left greater than right.  An MRI was done (although
no diffusion imaging could be obtained due to problem with MRI
machine) which did not show evidence of new stroke, but did
reveal periventricular T2 hyperintensities c/w chronic small
vessel disease.  An old, right cerebellar infarct was also seen.
Multiple areas of susceptibility were seen bilaterally in the
basal ganglia and thalami.  A repeat CT scan was done on [**12-6**]
which was negative for acute infarct or bleed.  Anti-platelets
were held due to fluctuations in Hct.  An EEG showed slow
background and occasional generalized theta and delta slowing
c/w
drowsiness or mild encephalopathy.  She had carotid US which
showed mild, <40% bilateral proximal ICA stenosis.  During her
course, her mental status improved.  Neuro exam has shown
decreased attention, dysarthria and mild right facial droop. She
was started on aspirin, lipitor and ACEI for secondary stroke
prevention.

2.  PULM:
Initially intubated and sedated, but extubated [**12-6**] without
complications.  CXR has shown mild CHF and LLL atelectasis vs
infiltrate. She was treated with Levofloxacin for PNA.  Rpt CXR
showed bilateral pleural effusions and mild CHF.  Her
respiratory status improved after lasix. She was started on
atrovent and albuterol nebs with resolution of wheezing and SOB.

3. CV:
Her inital EKG showed non-specific anterolateral ST changes.
Cardiac enzymes were positive with peak troponin of 0.54.  Echo
showed EF 35%, mildly dilated LA, mild left ventricular hypo
(inferior wall), mild-moderate AR, MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] HTN.  Cardiology
consult saw her and felt that the elevated troponin and
decreased
EF were likley indicative of CAD.  They recommended medical
management with beta blocker and anti-platelet (ASA).  If
patient
becomes symptomatic, they suggest evaluation with persantine
stress test.  Her lipid profile showed HDL 42, LDL 68, and TG
77.
She was started on a statin and ACEI.  She should have an
outpatient persantine stress test if she develops cardiac
symptoms.

4. GI:
Initially fed with NGT.  Now able to tolerate oral feeding per
swallow eval today.  Continue GI ppx.  Stool guiac has been
negative.

5. RENAL/LYTES:
Elevated BUN/Cre-do not know baseline Cre.  Now also with
hypernatremia-started on free water hydration today. Started on
ACEI-need to follow up lytes and BUN/Cre as an outpatient.

6. ID:
Pt had postitive UA on admission and was started on
Levofloxacin.  Also has LLL infiltrate on CXR.  Will cont abx
for 7 day course. She has been afebrile and her

7. Heme:
On admission, Hct was 27.8.  She rec'd 2 U PRBCs in the unit
with
poor Hct response.  Yesterday, rec'd an additional 2 U PRBCs,
Hct
rose to 40.  She was started on ASA 325mg as her Hct was stable
post transfusion.  She should have follow up iron studies and
B12 level as an outpatient.

8. Endocrine:
Her HbA1C was mildly elevated.  She should adhere to a diabetic
diet.  Synthroid was continued at pre-admission dose

9.  Rehab:
PT/OT evaluated the patient and she will be discharged for
continued PT.
