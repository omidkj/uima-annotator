Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, diverting loop
ileostomy.


History of Present Illness:
81M who underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for large
polyps 3 days before this admission. He presented to an outside
hospital the morning of this admission with acute onset of
abdominal pain and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] emergency room;
he was febrile. His abdomen was very tender. There was a small
amount of intraperitoneal air on x-ray, and a CT scan was done,
showing extravasation of contrast. It was then planned to take
him emergently to the OR for exploratory laparotomy.

Past Medical History:
PMH: colon polyps, MI x 2, HTN, HL, COPD, BPH

PSH: tracheostomy [**2196**] after MVA w/cricoid fracture and
laryngeal injury ([**2196**]),removal of granulation tissue at trach
site, decannulation ([**2197**]); lap left colectomy ([**2206-2-24**]);
Exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, diverting loop
ileostomy ([**2206-2-27**]).




Social History:
Portuguese-speaking; supportive bilingual daughter, supportive
family


Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
GEN: NAD, A&Ox3, elderly-appearing
CV: RRR
PULM: some coarse BS throughout, improved with coughing,
decreased BS at bases
ABD: soft/non-distended, mildly appropriately ttp to palpation
peri-incisionally; ostomy site healthy-appearing; ostomy bag
with brown/green liquid and soft solid material
INCISION: clean, dry, intact, mild serous drainage, no erythema
or induration
EXT: WWP
NEURO: grossly-intact

Pertinent Results:
CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2206-2-27**] 11:40 AM
1. Large extravasation of air and contrast, of uncertain source.
No evidence of extravasation at the level of the stomach,
duodenum, or at the rectosigmoid anastomosis.
2. Small bowel and colonic wall thickening, likely reactive to
peritonitis.
3. Enlarged prostate.
4. Left lower lobe nodule might represent atelectasis, although
a true lung nodule cannot be excluded. Followup to resolution in
three months is
recommended.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2206-3-5**] 2:13 PM
Likely post-operative paralytic ileus, and less likely bowel
obstruction.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2206-3-5**] 2:13 PM
Stable left lower lung opacification and new right lower lung
opacity may represent combination of right lower lung collapse
and a small pleural effusions but cannot exclude infectious
process.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient re-presented shortly after his discharge from his
left colectomy (for large polyps), this time for severe
abdominal pain. He went to the OR for an exploratory laparomoty
with primary repair of colonic perforation and diverting
ileostomy. He tolerated the procedure well; for details, see the
separately-dictated operative note.
.
Following his procedure, he was brought intubated to the TSICU,
and on phenylephrine for blood pressure support. He was weaned
from the phenylephrine on the same day, and he was extubated
successfully on POD#1. He was stable for transfer to the floor
on POD#2.
.
NEURO/PAIN: The patient was weaned from sedation when extubated
on POD#1. His pain was well-controlled, initially with
intermittent IV narcotics, and then with PO tylenol and
oxycodone. He was neurologically intact, and remained A&Ox3
.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Immediately post-op, his BP was supported with
phenylephrine, but this was able to be weaned later on POD#0. In
the TSICU, he was initially tachycardic, likely secondary to
hypovolemia, and he continued to receive fluid resuscitation.
With adequate fluid resuscitation, he stabilized from a
cardiovascular standpoint. His home metoprolol was restarted,
and his captopril was held secondary to his initial ARF.
.
RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated on POD#1. By POD#2, he
was ambulating well on room air, without desaturation.
Throughout his stay, the patient was noted to have coarse breath
sounds, with some wheezing. He does have a history of COPD. He
was encouraged to continue ambulation, use incentive spirometry,
and was out of bed to a chair as much as possible when resting.
He was given nebulizer treatments. A CXR on POD#6 suggested
basilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions; at this time it
was also decided to decrease the patient's IVF to prevent fluid
overload. He remained stable from a respiratory standpoint, with
continual encouragement to ambulate, cough, and undergo chest
PT. He was incidentally noted to have a lef tlung nodule on his
chest CT, and he should see his PCP for scheduling of a 3-month
follow-up CT chest to evaluate for resolution.
.
GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient had a new ostomy following the
procedure. He received ostomy teaching. The output was
monitored, and it stayed at an appropriate level. The patient
was NPO following his surgery, and maintained on IVF as above.
He was started on clears on POD#2, but he experienced
intermitttent nausea and vomiting until POD#7, when he was
finally able to consistently tolerate clears. During episodes of
nausea, his diet was accordingly backed down to NPO. He was then
advanced from clears to fulls and finally a regular diet, which
he tolerated. Unfortunately, he consistently had little
appetite, and we worked with the patient to improve PO intake.
He was given Ensure supplements, and care was taken to order
food that he would find palatable. His family brought in food
from home. The patient did have occasional small-volume of
dark/clear regurgitation or reflux, but this was not thought to
be true emesis, and it was not associated with nausea. The
patient had had this before, and would manage it with
over-the-counter medications. He was started on ranitidine. When
home, he will have VNA services help with monitoring of PO
intake and ostomy output.
.
GENITOURINARY: He was noted to have acute renal failure,
prerenal etiology, and he was successfully managed with IVF; his
UOP was monitored with a foley, and his medications were
initially renally-dosed; his creatinine reached his baseline by
about POD#4. The patient has a history of urinary retention, and
he had actually been discharged from his last admission with
foley in place, with plans for outpatient urology follow-up. He
kept his foley catheter for the majority of this admission, and
a voiding trial was done successfully on the day of discharge.
He never showed signs of urinary tract infection. His urine
output was monitored, especially initially during his ARF, and
he was treated with IVF accordingly. Later in his hospital
course, when his IVF were decreased over concern for pulmonary
manifestations of mild fluid overload, he was given IV lasix,
and given intermittent doses of albumin. His creatinine was back
at his baseline by POD#4.
.
HEME: The patient received 1 unit of PRBC intraoperatively. His
hematocrit was monitored, and he received no further
transfusions.
.
ID: Since presentation at the outside hospital and through
POD#7, the patient remained on vancomycin and zosyn to cover for
bowel spillage from his colonic perforation. His WBC was
trended, and was as high as 13.6 on POD#3 and by POD#10 it was
within normal limits at 9.8. It was not thought that he
developed pneumonia, and he had no evidence for a UTI. His wound
was monitored freqnently, and it did have some serous drainage,
at one point purulent, but two of the middle staples were
removed to allow better drainage and by POD#11 he only had
minimal serous drainage at the wound.
.
ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was monitored, and he wa
stable from an endocrine standpoint.
.
PROPHYLAXIS: He was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and
pneumatic boots. He ambulated frequently and used incentive
spirometry. His foley was changed. In the immediate postop
period and when not tolerating much PO intake, he was given
famotidine.
.
DISPOSITION: Physical therapy worked with the patient and
cleared him for home with PT. V
