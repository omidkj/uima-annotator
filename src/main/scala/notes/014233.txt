Brief Hospital Course:
21 y/o with history of polysubstance abuse with active withdrawl
(heroin, benzos, alcohol), presented from detox with asthma
exacerbation in the setting of influenza and active smoking.
.
#. Asthma exacerbation: On admission had significantly decreased
BS and wheezing.  Likely exacerbated by influenza. Had poisitve
DFA for influenza A. It appears that he was not reliably using
his asthma maintenance medications. Active smoking is also
likely contributing to uncontrolled asthma. Patient was started
on Tamiflu + Levofloxacin received 3 days of Levofloxacin, but
this was discontinued at the time of transfer out of the ICU.
He also was treated with steroids which were gradually tapered,
Advair 250/50 [**Hospital1 **], and nebs. Lung auscultation much improved
with this. He was gradually weaned off of oxygen, and at the
time of discharge, his breathing was back to baseline.  He was
discharged on Prednisone 10 mg po q day, which he will receive
for several more days.
.
#. Polysubstance abuse and ?withdrawal: Recent use of benzos and
heroin, as well as heavy EtOH 4 days prior to admission. History
of withdrawal but not seizures.  Patient was quite agitated,
diaphoretic, and tachycardic, with improvement after
administration of clonidine.  He was treated with clonidine and
valium on a CIWA scale. At the time of discharge, it appeared
that his [**Doctor Last Name **] on the CIWA scale was due to his baseline
psychiatric issues and not active withdrawl.  Social
work/Addictions followed throughout the hospitalization.
.
#. CoNS bacteremia; probable contaminant:
Blood culture [**3-3**] was positive for CoNS. Pt was covered with
Vancomycin IV while awaiting results of surveillance blood
cultures and cardiac echo. Cardiac echo was normal and without
evidence of endocarditis. Surveillance blood cultures were
drawn, and remain negative >48 hours. The positive blood culture
was likely a contaminant.
.
#. Tachycardia: Sinus tach on EKG. Negative d-dimer decreases
concern for PE. Suspect significant component due to patient's
significant anxiety issues. Tachycardia resolves during periods
of lower anxiety.
.
#. Depression/bipolar disorder/ Anxiety:
Psychiatry was consulted and assisted in management of his
anxiety and other psychiatric issues. Pt was treated as follows:

- Gabapentin 600 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]
- Clonazepam 0.5 mg PO/NG TID
- BuPROPion (Sustained Release) 150 mg PO BID
- Quetiapine extended-release 200 mg PO HS
- traZODONE 50 mg PO/NG HS:PRN insomnia
Pt was covered with a CIWA scale during the admission for his
history of alcohol and benzo abuse, however, I strongly suspect
that his CIWA actually reflected pt's anxiety and NOT active
withdrawl at the time of discharge.
