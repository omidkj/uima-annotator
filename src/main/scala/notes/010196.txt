Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
62 yo M h/o achalasia s/p laparoscopic [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy [**Month (only) **]
[**2111**], hyperlipidemia, BPH who presented to the ED with chest
pain.  For the past few days he has complained of flu-like
symptoms with right sided chest pain and was taking
dayquil/nyquil for relief.  Yesterday, he developed different
left sided chest pressure that was substernal without relief, he
took nyquil and went to bed, and awoke with the continued pain.
He took a russian medication for angina without relief (some
type of valerian derivative).  He went to work today with
persistent chest pain and his daughter was called, who commented
that he was very pale with weak pulses and appeared quite ill.
She called 911, EMS arrived and provided 325 ASA.  Of note, he
recently had an echo for lower extremity edema on [**2112-1-7**] which
showed preserved EF of 55% and no wall motion abnormality
(normal).
.
Upon arrival to the ED, initial VS: 96.4 88 110/60 16 100% 2L
Nasal Cannula.  EKG showed ST elevations in I/AVL and V4-V5 with
ST depressions in the inferior leads.
.
In the cath lab a occluded LAD which was stented with 2
overlapping DES.  He also had a tight diagonal lesion that was
angioplastied.  During the procedure he had some hypotension and
a HCT was drawn showing a crit of 19.9 from 26.7 prior to cath.
His baseline after his myotomy was 40 in [**2111-12-1**].
.
On arrival to the CCU, VS: 98.7 93 92/61 95% on 2L.  He
complained of [**3-11**] chest pressure that had decreased from [**11-9**]
previously.  Denied SOB, nausea, vomiting.  Also, specifically
denied any melena or BRBPR since his discharge after myotomy.
He had one episode of melena during his last admission that
resolved, with a HCT of 40 at discharge.

PERTINENT STUDIES

[**2112-1-30**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated severe single-vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal. The
LAD had
a 99% thrombotic lesion in the mid-vessel segment. This extended
into
the ostium of a large D1 branch causing total occlusion of the
D1. The
LCX had mild luminal disease throughout. The dominant RCA was a
large-caliber vessel with ulcerations in the mid-vessel segment.

2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated
left-sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 31mmHg. Systemic arterial
pressures
were low-normal with a measured central aortic pressure of
99/54/64.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PCI of the LAD with overlapping 2.5x28mm and
2.5x12mm [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]-dilated to 3.0mm (see PTCA comments).
5. Successful thrombectomy and PTCA rescue of a large diagonal
branch
(see PTCA comments).
6. Successful RFA groin closure with 6F AngioSeal device.

[**2112-1-31**] Echocardiogram
Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness with
moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function and
regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with coronary
artery disease involving a proximal lesion in a likely
wrap-around left anterior descending coronary artery. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared to the previous study of [**2112-1-7**] (images reviewed),
the regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
depression in left ventricular systolic ejection fraction are
new. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now
appreciated; it's presence/absence was not commented upon on the
prior study.

[**2112-1-31**] CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis without Contrast
1. Moderate pulmonary edema and central vascular congestion,
with moderate
size bilateral pleural effusions, compatible with cardiac
decompensation,
given current STEMI.
2. Dilated esophagus filled with food products and fluid,
compatible with
achalasia. Status post [**Doctor Last Name **] myotomy. No secondary signs of
perforation.
3. Global decrease in blood density, suggestive of chronic
anemia.
4. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process.
Specifically, no
retroperitoneal bleed detected.

[**2112-2-1**] CXR
1. Bibasilar opacities, worse on the left, with possible new
left effusion.
2. Limited assessment of superior mediastinum due to lordotic
positioning.
3. Probable right humeral diaphysis enchondroma. When the
patient is stable, recommend clinical correlation to e
