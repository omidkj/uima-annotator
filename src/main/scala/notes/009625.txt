Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
coffee ground emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion x 3


History of Present Illness:
68M w/ h/o paroxysmal afib s/p cardioversion [**12-17**], discharged
with INR 4.1 off coumadin, who presented to OSH on [**12-19**] w/ 5h
increasing right flank pain and nausea. His flank pain began
suddenly while driving home from Foxwoods casino. The patient
denied trauma.
.
Of note, INR at time of cardioversion was 4.1, pt was discharged
home with instructions not to take coumadin for 1 day, then
start with half dose. He denied hematuria, CP/SOB. CT abdomen at
OSH revealed right perinephric hematoma with contrast
extravasation. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-19**]. Overnight,
his Hct fell 35.9 -> 26 over 12 hours. INR on admission was 2.4.
Cr was 1.3 (baseline 1.2). He received vitamin K, 1U PRBC, 2
bags FFP. He remained hemodynamically stable throughout. On the
morning of [**12-19**], he was found to have 250cc coffee ground
emesis. Per report, NG lavage did not clear. The pt was taken to
angiography to assess perinephric bleeding, which was
unremarkable. Repeat NG lavage afterwards, upon arrival to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**], was negative.

MRI abdomen [**12-22**]:
IMPRESSIONS:
1.  Right perinephric collection with signal characteristics
consistent with hemorrhage. The suggested etiology is, when also
corrlelated with CT is a right upper pole angiomyolipoma (AML).
A short-term followup examination is recommended to assess
resolution of the perinephric fluid collection.
2.  Cholelithiasis.
3.  Hepatic lesions, which are likely cysts.


Brief Hospital Course:
## perinehpric hematoma
CT abdomen at OSH revealed right perinephric hematoma with
contrast extravasation. Pt was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-19**] and
next morning pt was found to have 250cc cofeee ground emesis. NG
lavage did not clear. pt was taken to angiography to assess
perinephric bleeding, which was unremarkable. repeat NG lavage
afterwards, upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], was negative (few clots, no
bleeding). His hct had dropped from baseline 36 to 28 on
admission.  He received a total of 3 units of PRBC's since
admission, and then his hct subsequently stabilized.  MRI of the
abdomen suggested cause of perinephric bleed to be due to an
angiomyolipoma. Urology recommended follow up CT in [**3-14**] weeks.
.
# GIB
He initially presented with coffee ground emesis which cleared
with NG lavage and was hemodynamically stable. He was maintained
on a PPI. He was H. pylori negative. GI recommended that he be
followed as an outpatient with colonoscopy and endoscopy.
.
## atrial fibrillation
On first transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was initially in afib with
RVR.  He was refractory to 2 electrical cardioversions. He was
continued on sotalol, but his dose was increased. Upper
endoscopy was deferred at that time due to pt's increasing O2
requirement (due to RLL pneumonia) as well as Afib. A third
cardioversion had been planned when the patient spontaneously
converted to NSR. He was then transferred to the floor. Then, on
[**2121-12-24**], patient again developed afib with RVR, rate unable to
be controlled, and he was transferred back to ICU for diltiazem
drip for rate control.
.
He was then electrically cardioverted successfully, was started
on amiodarone, and has remained in NSR.  He did not require TEE
prior to the electrical cardioversions because episodes of Afib
lasted less than 48 hours.  His pnuemonia is being treated with
Ceftriaxone.  His hct has remained stable, with the GI service
recommending endoscopy and colonoscopy as an outpatinet.  His
coumadin and aspirin have been held during this admission.  He
was then transferred to the cardiology service for further
monitoring. The following morning ([**12-27**]) he converted again to
afib with heart rates in the 110s-120s. It did not respond to
lopressor 5 IVx2 or diltiazem 10mg IV x1. PO diltiazem was
started [**2121-12-28**] and increased to 90mg po qid. Amiodarone was
continued. The morning of [**12-29**], he converted back to NSR
spontaneously after 5mg IV lopressor with HR in the 60s. His QT
interval in NSR was ~430. TFTs and LFTs were normal in-house,
and he will need outpatient PFTs.  Pt will require twice annual
lfts and tfts, as well as baseline and annual cxr, pfts, and eye
exam which will be deferred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11649**].
.
## hypoxia
The patient was noted to develop an oxygen requirement while in
afib. His hypoxia was felt to likely be from afib, although a
contribution from pneumonia was also considered. He was started
on ceftriaxone on [**12-24**] for focal opacity seen on CXR.
Aithromycin was added on [**12-27**] for atypical coverage but d/c'ed
due to potential to prolong the QT interval. He was discharged
on cefpodoxime and doxycycline with improved oxygenation to
complete a 10-day course of antibiotics.
- d/c on cefpodoxime, doxy

#HTN
Lisinopril and lasix were continued on home doses. He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course.
