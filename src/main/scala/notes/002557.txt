HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 65 year old female
with a past medical history notable for diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction and coronary artery bypass graft, right lower
lobectomy, asthma and congestive heart failure, who presents
complaining of cough times one week, malaise and fatigue.
The patient had a low grade temperature of 99.6 F., at home.
The patient denied any lower extremity edema or weight gain.
The patient's peak flows at home were in the 150 range.

The patient was recently admitted to the hospital [**1-28**]
until [**2-5**] for similar complaints of shortness of
breath and cough.  At that time, she was treated with
steroids, Azithromycin and nebulizers for a presumed
bronchitis exacerbation.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was treated with a
Combivent nebulizer, Solu-Medrol intravenously, Levaquin and
Lasix.

4.  Coronary artery disease status post inferior myocardial
infarction in [**2182**]; status post coronary artery bypass graft
in [**2190**]; most recent catheterization in [**2196-8-1**] with an
ejection fraction of 40%; left internal mammary artery with
40% disease and right coronary artery with 90% disease.
5.  Status post right lower lobectomy for question of
tuberculosis disease at age 16.
6.  Asthma.
7.  Congestive heart failure.
8.  Fibromyalgia.
9.  Osteoarthritis.
10. Low back pain secondary to spinal stenosis.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and tetracycline.

MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg a day.
2.  Prednisone taper.
3.  Protonix 40 mg a day.
4.  Trandolapril 2 mg a day.
5.  NPH 34 units in the morning and 26 units at night.
6.  Subcutaneous insulin.
7.  Albuterol inhaler.
8.  Fluticasone inhaler.
9.  Valium p.r.n.
10. Sotalol 80 mg twice a day.
11. Nystatin swish and swallow.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives at home independently.
She has around 12 siblings.  She has a 30 pack history of
tobacco but quit in [**2182**].  She does not use any alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Temperature 99.5 F.; pulse 96; blood
pressure 110/60; respiratory rate 24; pulse oximetry 95% on
two liters.  In general, a sad tearful female with a flat
affect.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to
light.  Mucous membranes were moist.  Neck is supple without
any jugular venous distention.  Chest:  Crackles at the lung
bases about [**2-3**] of the way up.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate, no murmurs.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities are warm
without edema with good pulses.  Neurological is alert and
oriented times three.

LABORATORY:  Data at the time of admission is white blood
cell count of 10.3 with 70% neutrophils, hematocrit of 39.7,
platelets of 226.  Sodium 134, potassium 4.4 hemolyzed,
chloride 95, bicarbonate 29, BUN 24, creatinine 1.4 with
baseline of 1.0, and glucose of 120.

Chest x-ray shows blunting of the left costophrenic angle,
right middle and lower lobe pneumonia.

EKG with normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 95, old Q waves in
the inferior leads with no acute ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient was
initially admitted to the Medical Floor for treatment of her
multi-lobar pneumonia.  She initially maintained an oxygen
saturation of greater than 95% on three liters of nasal
cannula, however, developed hypoxia to 80% with saturation of
90% on non-rebreather, in the setting of a narrow complex
tachycardia while she was on the floor.  However, the patient
remained hypoxic at about 96% on a nonrebreather; therefore
she was transferred to the Fenard Intensive Care Unit.

In the Intensive Care Unit her arterial blood gas revealed a
pH of 7.16, a pCO2 of 74 and pO2 of 94 with abnormal mental
status.  The patient's culture data revealed a Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and the patient's
antibiotic regimen was changed to Vancomycin.  There was also
a question of aspiration.

The patient was initially tried on a trial of Bi-PAP,
however, she did not tolerate this very well and her mental
status decreased to the point of requiring intubation.

Initially there was significant confusion regarding her code
status, as on a previous admission it was documented that she
wanted to be resuscitated but did not want to be intubated.
So, after discussion with various of her attendings and given
her clinical status, the decision was made to intubate the
patient as she was in acute respiratory distress.

The patient continued to require high ventilatory support and
had adult respiratory distress syndrome physiology.

2.  Tachycardia:  The patient, just prior to her transfer to
the Intensive Care Unit, had a tachycardia that was presumed
to be either an atrial tachycardia versus an NRT.  She
decreased her rate from the mid 200s to 100 after receiving
diltiazem 20 mg intravenously and was followed closely in the
Intensive Care Unit.  She had multiple episodes of
tachycardia and the Electrophysiology Service was consulted
as well as the Electrophysiology physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **],
occasionally her rhythm would break with Idenosine and
occasionally with Diltiazem and eventually she was on a
diltiazem drip.  There was a question of amiodarone loading
as well.

Of note, her Sotalol, which she had been maintained on as an
outpatient, had been discontinued during her hospital course
as she had started to develop renal failure.

3.  Hypotension:  The patient remained hypotensive after she
was intubated and was not fluid responsive.  Her MAPs were
around 50.  She was started on norepinephrine and vasopressin
and the etiology was thought to be sepsis although it then
also became cardiogenic later in her hospital course.

4.  Acid Base:  The patient had a mixed respiratory and
metabolic acidosis.  She was given intravenous fluids and her
respiratory status was maintained with a ventilator, although
it was very difficult to correct her acid base status given
her overwhelming sepsis as well as her worsening renal
failure.

5.  Acute Renal Failure:  The patient had worsening renal
failure likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis with
anuria.  CVH was debated upon, however, ultimately a change
in the patient's code status did not require use of this node
of volume removal.

DISPOSITION:   After extensive discussion with the family,
initially the patient was clearly full code as she was
intubated, ventilated and on pressors, however, after two to
three family meetings and multi-system organ failure
including cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal with overwhelming
sepsis, Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia
and progressive overall worsening, it was decided that goal
for care would change from "Do Not Resuscitate" "Do Not
Intubate" followed by COMFORT MEASURES ONLY status.  The
patient had multiple family members who came to see her prior
to her demise.

The patient expired at 03:55 a.m. on [**2198-2-18**].
