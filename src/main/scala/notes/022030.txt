lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  A nondisplaced point
of maximal impulse.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally; occasional inspiratory wheeze.  The abdomen
revealed normal active bowel sounds, nontender and
nondistended, and no masses.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Per
Emergency Department, guaiac-negative.  Extremities were
clean, dry, and intact.  Good dorsalis pedis and posterior

urea nitrogen of 28, creatinine of 1.5, blood sugar of 174.
Creatine kinase of 601, MB of 53, with an MB fraction of 8.8.
Troponin was 45.6.  Urinalysis showed moderate leukocyte
esterase, 11 to 20 white blood cells, few bacteria, 3 to 5
squamous epithelial cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed ST depressions
in V2 through V5; which was improved two hours later, normal
axis and intervals, normal sinus rhythm, no Q waves.

Chest x-ray was negative for cardiopulmonary processes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Coronary artery disease.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was
admitted to the C-MED Service for further treatment of her
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.  She was given
aspirin, intravenous and p.o. Lopressor, heparin, and
Integrilin in the Emergency Department.

On the floor, she was also started on captopril 6.25 mg p.o.
t.i.d. with good results.  She had no further symptoms during
her hospital stay.

On [**2113-5-9**], she underwent cardiac catheterization which
showed a right-dominant system with severe 3-vessel disease.
The left main had mild disease, left anterior descending
artery with 70% proximal stenosis and 60% distal stenosis
after a large second diagonal.  The left circumflex was
diffusely diseased with a thrombotic 80% stenosis after first
obtuse marginal.  The second obtuse marginal with 50%
stenosis with TIMI-II flow.  Dominant right coronary artery
was diffusely disease with 80% and 90% serial stenoses in the
proximal and middle vessel.

The patient underwent evaluation by Cardiothoracic Surgery
and was deemed appropriate for both coronary artery bypass
graft and mitral valve replacement.  Of note, an
echocardiogram was completed on [**2113-5-10**] showing mild
regional left ventricular dysfunction with severe hypokinesis
of the posterobasal wall.  There was 1+ aortic regurgitation
and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation seen.

2.  ENDOCRINE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] has a history of diabetes mellitus
times two years.  She was initially treated only with Amaryl
but continued on q.i.d. fingersticks and sliding-scale
insulin.  She was also placed on an American Diabetes
Association cardiac diet.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was to be going to coronary
artery bypass graft and mitral valve replacement on [**2113-5-12**].  At that time she will be transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Peripheral vascular disease.
6.  Tobacco history.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was fair.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  Medications will be discussed in a
later Discharge Summary.
