Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aleve

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9598**]
Chief Complaint:
diarrhea, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with recently diagnosed lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma on rituximab presented from [**Hospital1 **] long-term facility
with 2 days of loose stools, abdominal pain, chills, low-grade
fevers, and generalized malaise. Patient was hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] in [**2192-5-17**] for E. coli bacteremia and was found to be
neutropenic secondary to lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. He was then
discharged to [**Hospital1 **]. He received his first dose of rituximab on
[**2192-6-21**]. Patient has been neutropenic. On [**2192-6-26**], he started
having diarrhea and was started on metronidazole 500 mg PO bid.
C. diff toxin came back positive today, [**2192-6-27**].  Patient
continued to do poorly, with low-grade fever and chills, and
therefore was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2191-6-28**].
.
In the ED, T 100.4, HR 99, BP 82/45 (but on repeat SBP 132
before any intervention), RR 18, 98%RA. His abdomen was
distended as baseline and was moderately tender. Abdominal CT
revealed colitis. His WBC was 0.8 with 29% neutrophils, 27%
bands, and 39% lymphs. He was given cefepime, PO vancomycin, IV
vancomycin and admitted to BMT.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
# Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma:
- [**5-/2192**]: presented with E. coli bacteremia secondary to
neutropenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular bone
marrow with involvement by a chronic lymphoproliferative
disorder. By immunohistochemical stains, B-cells comprise 10-20%
of overall marrow cellularity, with dim co-expression for CD5.
Reactive T-cells are present and express CD3.  Plasma cells are
reactive for CD138, and comprise <10% of marrow cellularity. The
absence of significant lymphadenopathy, presence of cytoplasmic
immunoglobulin inclusions in plasma cells in the marrow and
rather strong expression of CD20 by flow cytometry suggest
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or, alternatively, small lymphocytic
lymphoma (total lymphocyte count <4,000), with plasma cell
differentiation.
- [**2192-6-21**]: first dose of rituximab
.
OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY:
- recurrence malignant melanomas (including local recurrences),
last [**2191**] that was pT1b
- [**Doctor Last Name **] 3+3 prostate adenocarcinoma (diagnosed [**2183**]) followed
by surveillance with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
- benign prostatic hypertrophy
- cholecystectomy
- known chronic intestinal pneumatosis
- DM2 on insulin
- HTN
- asthma
- hyperlipidemia
- GERD

STUDIES:
# Abd/pel CT [**2192-6-27**]: (prelim) Marked wall thickening and
inflammatory changes involving the sigmoid colon, with mild
distension of the descending colon, c/w colitis, likely
infectious. Mild inflammatory changes surrounding the cecum.
# CXR [**2192-6-27**]: (my read) elevated right hemidiaphragm, no
infiltrate, unchanged from [**2192-6-8**]

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with recently diagnosed lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma, neutropenic on rituximab, recently with E. coli

.
# C. diff colitis: with evidence on CT. Patient was
hemodynamically stable, and was started on Vanco PO and
metronidazole IV, which improved his diarrhea. Patient shall
continue to take Vanco PO for 2 weeks after discontinuation of
all other antibiotics.
