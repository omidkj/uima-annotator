Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was evaluated in the trauma bay by general surgery and
orthopaedic surgery and admitted to the trauma surgical ICU on
[**12-30**] for observation and serial hematocrit checks. He was taken
to the OR on [**12-30**] with Orthopaedic Surgery for I&D and ORIF L
humerus, ORIF & IM nail L femur fractures, and I&D L open ulna
fracture. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
back to the TSICU postoperatively. See operative note for
details. He was kept intubated due to his extensive injuries and
need for repeated OR trips. He was taken to the OR on [**12-31**] with
Vascular Surgery for IVC filter placement. He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred back to the TSICU
postoperatively. See operative report for details. He was taken
to the OR on [**1-2**] with Orthopaedic Surgery for ORIF L ankle
fracture, ORIF L olecranon fracture, ORIF pubic symphysis
diastasis, and closed reduction and casting R calcaneus
fracture. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
back to the TSICU postoperatively. He continued to recover and
his hematocrit remained stable. He was extubated successfully on
[**1-3**]. He was transferred to the surgical floor on [**1-4**]. He
experienced abdominal distention and pain at that time. He was
made NPO with an NG tube with some relief. A KUB taken at that
time showed dilated, air filled, small and large bowel
consistent with ileus. The NG tube was removed on [**1-5**] and his
diet was slowly advanced, which he tolerated well. He was stable
for discharge on [**1-7**]. However, overnight he was febrile to
101.2 with a WBC=13.7 on [**1-8**] (up from 11). He was asymptomatic
and a chest xray demonstrated interval improvement. There was a
small amount of erythema at his L elbow incision, and
orthopaedics recommended starting a 10-day course of Keflex. He
continued to be afebrile overnight until [**2199-1-9**] and continued to
be asymptomatic. He will need inpatient rehabilitation for his
extensive orthopaedic injuries. He will follow-up with trauma
surgery, orthopaedic surgery, and vascular surgery as
instructed.
