History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49249**] is a 54 year old gentleman with HTN, DM2, CKD
(baseline Cr 2.0-2.2), CAD s/p CABG [**2186**], as well as systolic
and diastolic heart failure (EF had been as low as 20% but last
known to be 40%), who was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**]
Cardiology service from clinic on [**2195-10-16**] for worsening dyspnea
over 2 weeks. CHF exacerbation was in the setting of new
inferior HK and he was diuresed with hopes of pursuing RHC/LHC.
Hospital course was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr>3.0), PIV-associated
MSSA bacteremia (did not want [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] dc'ed on IV nafcillin x4
weeks). RHC was done and showed elevated filling pressures, so
he was transferred to the CCU for Milrinone to assist with Lasix
gtt. Due to infection, he was only on milrinone for a few hours.
He was transferred back to the floor and was diuresed well prior
to discharge. He followed up in clinic on [**2195-10-27**] and was found
to have creatinine elevated to 5.4 despite holding torsemide on
[**10-22**] (took it [**10-27**]). He was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] for
management of his [**Last Name (un) **].
On interview this afternoon, he denies SOB at rest. He hasn't
been walking much, but doesn't feel "crushing fatigue" now like
he did before. He has been sitting to sleep, which he does think
is worse than when he was admitted. His itchiness continues, but
isn't worse than when in the hospital. He does endorse nausea,
diarrhea (8 loose stools a day) which he reports started with
the nafcillin. Denies fever, chills, abd pain. He reports "I
don't do well with IVs. They always increase my creatinine
regardless of what it is." He has been following the same diet
and eating light. He reports poor intake of fluid as he's trying
to avoid drinking a lot, "much less than 1L a day." His right
eye seems like it has a swollen eyelid today, but he hasn't
noticed. His wife reports that it always looks like this. No
headache.
Reports we weighed 219 today (recorded as 219.2), 215 yesterday,
211 on discharge.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. +Orthopnea, +PND

Imaging:
[**11-11**] Echo
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-11-9**],
left ventricular cavity size is smaller and overall ejection
fraction has increased.

[**2195-11-9**] Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-10-29**],
biventricular systolic function has decreased.

COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed severely elevated right
and left
sided filling pressures.  The mean RA pressure was severely
elevated at
18 mmHg, and the RVEDP was severely elevated at 22 mmHg.  There
was
severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of
80/33 mmHg
and a mean PA pressure of 49 mmHg.  The mean wedge pressure was
severely
elevated at 32 mmHg.  The cardiac output and index were reduced
at 4.3
L/min and 2.0 L/min/m2.  The pulmonary vascular resistance was
moderately elevated at 316 dyne-sec/cm5.
2. Ultrasound of the right internal juggular vein suggested
thrombus
which is possibly related to the patient's right sided PICC
line,
however subsequent imaging indicated no thrombus but RIJ very
medially
displaced.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severely elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
2. Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3. Reduced cardiac output/index.
4. Moderately elevated PVR.
5. Possible thrombus in the right internal jugular vein which
was not
