History of Present Illness:
On admission:
66 yo female with h/o HTN p/w worsening L hand swelling and
erythema and R hip pain x 1 wk. Was seen at an ED in [**State 1727**] 2 wks
ago for CP, r/o ACS. Had a negative w/u, including a stress
test. Approx. 1 wk later presented to her PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] hip pain
and L hand swelling and erythema; PCP reassured her and
prescribed muscle relaxants and pain medications. Her sx have
gradually worsened over the past wk, to the point that she has
had to borrow her friend's walker for ambulation. Had an app't
with her PCP today, but on the advice of a roofer (who used to
be an EMT) came to the ED instead.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were as follows: T 97.9 P 84 BP 95/59
RR 12 O2sat 97%RA. She was started on vancomycin and Unasyn, and
given morphine 4mg IV and Tylenol 500mg po x 1 for pain relief.
CXR showed possible mild edema vs. atypical infection, and labs
were significant for a negative U/A and a WBC count of 35.7 with
79%N and 2%bands. Vitals on transfer were as follows: T 98.0 BP
133/58 P 85 O2sat 98%RA
.

.
BILATERAL HAND/WRIST:
IMPRESSION: Within limitations above, bilateral hand and wrist
are grossly
unremarkable except for marked soft tissue edema along the
dorsum of the left hand and the second digit of the right hand.
.
AP PELVIS/RIGHT HIP:
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable right hip series. There may be very
mild early
osteoarthritis.
.
MRI PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large loculated fluid collection which involves the right
iliacus, right obturator internus, right pelvic sidewall, and
right piriformis muscles. Additional loculated fluid collection
located left of the rectosigmoid junction. Given the history,
these are compatible with infected fluid collections. In the
absence of contrast, the precise extent of fluid vs inflamed
tissue cannot be determined.
2. Small bilateral hip joint effusions, nonspecific in
appearance. No
surrounding marrow edema.
3. Small right- sided sacroiliac joint effusion with marrow
edema on both
sides of the SI joint. This is suyspicious for infection of the
right si
joint, with surrounding osteomyelitis.
4. Abnormal signal in the L3 vetebral body, not fully evaluated
on this scan. The possibility of extension of infection to
involve the lspine remains a significant concern.
5. Diffusely abnormal patchy changes in the marrow on the T1
images, atypical for someone of this age. ? chronic anemia
versus infiltrative process of the marrow.
.
MRI L-SPINE:
CONCLUSION: Findings suggesting intraspinal epidural abscess
posterior to the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies. No findings to
suggest spinal osteomyelitis. However, this imaging technique
may have limited sensitivity for early osteomyelitis. Abscess
collections also noted in the right iliopsoas muscle and
posterior to the right sacrum.
.
MRI C-SPINE:
IMPRESSION:
Discitis osteomyelitis at C5-C6 and to a lesser extent C6-C7
with epidural and retropharyngeal abscesses, cord compression
and cord edema. Possible
osteomyelitis at T6/T7.
.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN:
IMPRESSION:
1. Several rounded fluid collections, suspicious for abscesses,
with the
largest anterior to right iliac bone measuring 2.2 cm x 2.9 cm,
with
additional ring-enhancing foci within the right iliacus muscle,
as well as
along the right pelvic sidewall. These are too small and also
anatomically
not amenable to percutaneous drainage.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, with associated
atelectasis/consolidation of the adjacent lungs.
3. Pulmonary edema, with numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules,
which may be infectious or inflammatory. Followup is recommended
following resolution of acute symptoms to ensure resolution of
the pulmonary nodules.
4. Post-surgical changes within the left iliac bone, and
adjacent
subcutaneous tissues.
5. Erosive changes of the right sacroiliac joint, could reflect
sacroiliatis given the adjacent abscesses.
.
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT
Thrombosis of the left cephalic vein. No deep venous thrombosis
in the left upper extremity. Basilic vein was not identified.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

IMPRESSION:
1. Possible right striated nephrogram suggestive of possible
pyelonephritis
and would recommend clinical correlation with urinalysis.
2. Unchanged abscesses seen along the right iliac bone.
3. Unchanged appearance to a right posterior pelvic wall drain.
4. L5 laminectomy with associated postoperative changes, which
appear stable.
5. Interval removal of posterior skin staples with a new 2 x 2 x
1.5 cm fluid
collection which tracks inferiorly.
6.Unchanged large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis and
consolidation. Improved pulmonary edema.
7. Area in the bladder and would recommend clinical correlation
with recent
instrumentation.

C-SPINE NON-TRAUMA [**1-2**] VIEWS
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-11**], there is little
change in the
appearance of the anterior and posterior fusions. No evidence of

hardware-related complication. There is some prominence of the
prevertebral
soft tissues, though this may merely reflect the relatively
recent operative
state. To evaluate for possible abscess formation, CT would be
necessary.
