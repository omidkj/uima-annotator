Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with COPD, asthma, ?CHF (on Lasix at home), on
home O2 2L NC admitted intubated and ventilated from OSH with
acute on chronic respiratory failure from the day of her
admission likely [**12-23**] to COPD exacerbation. The patient was
intubated and ventilated at OSH prior to transfer to our
institution. ABG on admission was consistent with acute on
chronic respiratory acidosis. She is on 2L nasal canula at home.
Acute respiratory failure was attributable to pneumonia, COPD
exacerbation and fluid overload from CHF exacerbation. CXR
showed possible bilateral effusions and basilar infiltrates. TTE
showed normal to hyperdynamic EF with diastolic dysfunction.
STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE grew in sputum. Patient was initially
treated with Levofloxacin + Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin and then
only oral Levaquin. She was covered for Influenza with Tamiflu
for 3 days until she ruled out per nasal swab. Patient was
extubated on day 2 of admission, following extubation she had
some hypoxia which improved with IV Lasix 40 mg (acute diastolic
heart failure). She was subsequently started on her home dose of
Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Patient was additionally treated with a course
of prednisone as well as Albuterol and Ipratropium nebs and
Advair 250/50 1 puff [**Hospital1 **]. She had abdominal/inguinal superficial
skin infection which appeared fungal and improved markedly with
topical treatment. She had hypotension on admission was from
sedation agents. AM cortisol was elevated, ruling out adrenal
insufficiency. Levophed was weaned quickly without any need for
pressors since AM of [**1-6**]. She had RLE edema: from chronic
lymphedema without recurrent cellulitis. No evidence of DVT on
U/S. She was discharged home on [**12-24**] L of oxygen without rales or
wheezing.
