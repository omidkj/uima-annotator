of 51%, two vessel coronary artery disease and an aortic
valve area of 0.36 squared with one plus mitral
regurgitation.  He had a normal right coronary artery, a 70%
proximal left anterior descending lesion and a 70% left
circumflex lesion.  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for AVR and
coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Significant for history of aortic stenosis.
2.  History of hypertension.
3.  History of hypercholesterolemia.

5.  Status post left carotid endarterectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Folic acid.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Zoloft 100 mg p.o. q. day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for transient ischemic attack
prior to carotid surgery and otherwise unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, he is a well
developed, well nourished white male in no apparent distress.
Vital signs stable; afebrile.  HEENT examination
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Extraocular movements are intact.
 Oropharynx benign.  Neck was supple with full range of
motion; no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids two plus
and equal bilaterally with radiating murmurs.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination was regular rate and rhythm with
III/VI systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen was obese, soft,
nontender, with positive bowel sounds; no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were without clubbing or
cyanosis.  He had trace bilateral pedal edema.  Neurologic
examination was nonfocal.

He had carotid Doppler studies as an outpatient prior to
admission which revealed the right had moderate
calcification, 16 to 49% stenosis; the left was widely
patent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**1-3**], the patient was admitted and
underwent an aortic valve replacement with a #19 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
Mechanical Valve and a coronary artery bypass graft times two
with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending and reverse saphenous vein graft to the diagonal.
Cross clamp time was 97 minutes; total bypass time 117
minutes.

He was transferred to the CSRU on Neo and Propofol.  He was
extubated that day and the following morning his Neo was off.
He was transferred to the floor in stable condition.  He did
have issues with pain and required aggressive respiratory
therapy.  His white count jumped to 22,000 but all his
cultures were negative.  His chest tube was discontinued on
postoperative day number two and he also had his wires
discontinued and he was anti-coagulated with heparin and
Coumadin.

His INR did jump to 6.0 with 5 mg of Coumadin so his Coumadin
was held for a few days, and then he eventually stabilized on
1 mg.  His white blood cell count did come down to 12,000 and
on postoperative day number seven, he was discharged to home
in stable condition.

LABORATORY:  Labs on discharge were a white blood cell count
of 14,000, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 343,000.  Sodium 135,
potassium 4.0, chloride 100, CO2 27, BUN 15, creatinine 0.8,
blood sugar 110, PT 19.9 with an INR of 2.6.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice a day times seven days.
2.  Potassium 20 mEq p.o. twice a day times seven days.
