History of Present Illness:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 18195**].
.78 year old woman with h/o atrial fibrillation,
hypercholesterolemia, RA on prednisone, ? ocular stroke, and CAD
s/p RCA stent placement x2 in [**2103**] p/w BRBPR. She reports
several episodes of painless diarrhea on Wednesday and Thursday
of last week w/ BRBPR starting on Wednesday afternoon (enough to
fill the toilet).
On morning of admission, pt was noted was lightheaded and fell
on her right hip when getting up from the toilet. She denies any
LOC during the fall and denies trauma to the head. She was
brought in by EMS.
She denies any prior episodes of BRBPR. She usually has normal
stools. She did not eat any unusual foods and denies any recent
travels.
.
In the ED: initial VS: 98.9, 79, 132/104, 16, 99RA
She was given IVF, T&C for 4u of pRBCs. ECG is reportedly
unchanged (baseline LBBBB). She denies recent illnesses, f/c.
She denies any chest pain or SOB. No n/v, no abd pain, no
urinary symptoms.  Pt was transferred to MICU for monitoring and
transfusion.  In the MICU pt was given 2 units pRBCS and
remained stable with stable Hcts for 24 hours before, and was
transferred to the floor on [**2106-8-7**].

Pt only briefly on the floor, the evening of transfer at 11 pm
had another episode of BRBPR, for a total of 4 times, about
500-700cc in total. at that time her vitals were stable, SBP
160. Transfused 1 pRBCs, a second PIV was placed, and 2 more
units of blood were transfused. She was taken for a tagged RBC
scan scan, which showed active bleeding during the first 5
minutes on the left side. She was taken directly to the IR suite
for a mesenteric angiogram. An SMA injection showed no acute
bleed in the small bowel. [**Female First Name (un) 899**] was not visualzed at usual branch
point and had vessel branching posterior to aorta that is likely
[**Female First Name (un) 899**], which was severely stenosed. Contrast was unable to be
injected to visualize vascular distribution of colon. No
intervention was taken. Patient has known diverticular disease.


After this repeated episode pt has been stable. Pt has been
without BRBPR for 36-48 hours and had normal BP per the ICU
team.  BPs have been stable and patient has been feeling well.

.
[**2106-8-8**] GI bleeding study - IMPRESSION: Intermittent brisk GI
bleeding.
.
[**2106-8-6**] EKG Sinus rhythm. Consider left atrial abnormality. Left
axis deviation. Intraventricular conduction delay. Consider
inferior myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of
[**2105-9-20**] the axis is more leftward, ventricular premature beat is
not seen and QRS width is not as wide
.
Echo ([**2103**]) - The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 79 yo F w/ htn, a.fib (not on coumadin), RA
on prednisone p/w BRBPR s/p MICU admission. Pt currently with
stable Hct and > 36 without bloody bowel movement. Vitals
stable, monitoring crits serially.
.
# BRBPR: Likely with a LGIB most likely from bleeding
diverticuli.
- q8 hct now stable
- has received multiple units of packed RBCs in the setting of
GI bleed, now crit appears stable
- on admission, held asa, bblocker, and ticlid (anti-platelet)
in the setting of GI bleed, now has been stable, will be d/c as
per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**] on 81 mg PO aspirin (previously on 325 mg
daily), will d/c Ticlid and will continue outpatient carvedilol
as previously prescribed.
- postive repeat tagged RBC scan for bleeding however had
angiography where no intervention was performed
- had colonscopy which demonstrated multiple non-bleeding
diverticuli in the colon
- s/p multiple RBCs transfusion and right IJ catheter placement
and removal
.
# CAD: s/p 2 stents on ticlid, asa, carvedilol, statin
- restarted b-blocker and ASA 81 on discharge, will not restart
ticlid at this time as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**]

.
# CHF: diagnosed during last [**Location (un) 620**] admission, pt. was SOB on
presentation and improved with lasix. Did not get an echo there.
[**Month (only) 116**] benefit from repeat echo as outpatient.
- d/c home on carvedilol
.
# Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus rhythmn
- continue flecanide, currently not on anticoagulation likely
secondary to fall risk
- CHADS score = +1 HTN, +1 age, ? CHF +1
.
# Rheumatoid arthritis: continue prednisone
.
# Hypertension: HTN meds originally held, restarted avapro
today, and carvedilol once stable.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: atorvastatin.
.
# anxiety: continue ativan 1mg q6hrs prn
.
# Fen: low cholesterol diet, will d/c on outpatient vitamins and
mineral supplementation
.
# ppx: subQ heparin, can restart bowel regime
.
# code status: full code, confirmed with pt.
.
Full up scheduled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2912**] and PCP.
