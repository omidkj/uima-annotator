Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
83 yo man with cerebral palsy, h/o AVR with bioprosthetic valve
([**2085**]), paroxysmal AFib (previously on coumadin, stopped in
[**11/2104**] in the setting of GI bleed), h/o DVT ([**11/2104**]), who
presented to his PCP with three days of worsening SOB associated
with fevers. No chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, syncope,
PND, orthopnea, leg pain or swelling, nausea, vomiting, or
diarrhea. He was referred to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, inital vitals were: HR 109, BP 128/50, RR 16, 100% 3L
(90% on RA). WBC 9.0 with 85.8% PMNs. CXR with possible
pneumonia. U/A negative. EKG showed NSR, LAD, bifasicular block
c/w prior. He received ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presumed
CAP and was admitted to the floor.
.
At 5AM on the morning of hospital day 2, the patient was noted
to have low O2 sats on 3L NC (had been satting 92% on 3L NC
earlier in the night). He was placed on a shovel mask and was
given albuterol nebs. Suctioning revealed copious whitish
sputum. Repeat ABG went from 7.4/43/81 --> 7.30/50/68. CXR
appeared unchanged from previous. He was noted to be able to
follow simple commands, answering 'yes' and 'no' to questions
appropriately. Of note, the patient was not eating prior to the
event, has no known history of COPD or emphysema, and did not
receive any narcotics or sedating medication on the floor.

IMAGING:
[**2105-2-20**] LENI: No evidence of DVT in either leg.
.
[**2105-2-24**] CXR: Left basilar opacity may represent atelectasis
adjacent to a large hiatal hernia, although underlying infection
cannot be excluded. Mild patchy opacity in the right lung base
may also represent atelectasis or infection. Small bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
[**2105-2-25**] ECHO: LA is elongated. LV wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF =45-50%). The estimated CI is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). RV chamber size is normal with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic
aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The transaortic gradient is
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Moderate to
severe (3+) AR. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No MVP. Mild (1+)
MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Bioprosthetic aortic valve with moderate to severe
regurgitation and high transvalvular gradients c/w prosthetic
valve stenosis. Mild regional LV dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Moderate RV systolic dysfunction. Mild
MR.
.
[**2104-2-27**] CXR: Unchanged from prior. Moderate cardiomegaly.
Bilateral areas of atelectasis and likely small bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
[**2105-3-1**] CXR: Comparison with the previous study of [**2105-2-26**]. The
lung apices and thoracic inlet are partially obscured by the
patient's chin. There is streaky density at the lung bases
likely representing subsegmental atelectasis. In addition, there
is hazy density in the left costophrenic sulcus that may
represent pleural fluid. The retrocardiac area is not well
penetrated. The patient is status post median sternotomy as
before. Mediastinal structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo man with cerebral palsy, paroxysmal Afib, h/o DVT, and h/o
aortic valve replacement, admitted with fevers/SOB secondary to
[**Hospital **] hospital course complicated by an episode of hypoxic
respiratory distress.
.
# CAP/Hypoxic respiratory distress: Patient noted early on the
morning of hospital day 2 to have low O2 sats on 3L NC (90-93%)
