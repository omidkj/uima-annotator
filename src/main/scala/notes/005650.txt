CT L-spine ([**2188-9-26**])
1. Interval development of compression deformity at the T10
vertebral body. The previous seen T11 compression deformity is
again noted and there is associated kyphosis centered at this
area.
2. Well-defined, corticated soft tissue collection located
posterior to the
T8 to T10 vertebral levels. This is 8 cm x 3 cm in largest cross
sectional
diameter. [**Month (only) 116**] represent abscess or seroma and must be clinically
correlated.
3. Posterior lumbar spinal fusion hardware noted to be in place
with no sign of loosening. Anterior migration of the disc fusion
material at L1-L2 and L2-L3 levels, stable from previous
examination.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions and associated atelectasis, this
would be
better characterized with dedicated imaging of the lung if
clinically
indicated.
5. Abdominal, arterial calcification, stable from the study of
[**2186**].

CXR: Patchy opacity in the right lung base, which may represent
developing area of infection.

ECHO:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Mild to moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations or abscess seen. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid and mitral
regurgitation.

Knee XR: There are advanced degenerative changes in the knee,
with significant tricompartmental joint space narrowing and
spurring. There also appears to be a lucency within the lateral
knee compartment which may be related to mass effect or vacuum
phenomenon. There are additional ossific/calcific densities
within the knee, largest posteriorly measuring 1.2 cm, which
likely represent loose bodies within the joint. There is no
acute fracture or dislocation. Suprapatellar joint effusion is
present.

CT Head: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, vitals were initially 98.2, 181/85, 110, 16, 98% RA.
She did develop a fever of 102 and was given 1 gram of Tylenol.
CXR with RLL infiltrate (early) and she was given levofloxacin.
However, her BP dropped to 100 (from 180) and, at that point,
her abx were broadened to Vanc/Cefepime. The ED team felt she
might have also had early zoster on her left buttock and she was
ordered for valcyclovir. In the ED, she was persistently
tachycardic with HR 105-115. She received approx 2L IVF. Her
labs were notable for a Na 132 and CK 1000s (nml trop). Head CT
& cspine CT were done after hx of falls elicited??????no acute
pathology seen.
Patient was admitted to the MICU, where she was contnued on
vancomycin/ceftazidime, aggresive IVF, CT scan to assess for
cyst & hardware, CXR, CK, UA. CT of neck showed degenerative
changes in cervical spine, and collection of fluid in soft
tissue in L8-L10. Ortho tried draining fluid and obtained
purulent material on [**9-26**]. However, patient decided not to
pursue surgical management of the abscess. Patient grew [**7-18**]
Staph Aureus (MRSA). Since patient persistent patient she got
incision and debridement of bursa around posterior spinal
fusion, leaving hardware in place ([**9-28**]). She was tranfered
back to the ICU. Patient stable in ICU afterwards, afebrile for
24 hours, normal BP, then was transfered to the floor. ID was
consulted after surgery and agreed to continue antibiotics.
In the floor patient had persistent productive cough and CXR
without improvement. However, cough improved within the
following 2 days and dissapearead. On [**9-30**] patient complained
of right knee pain, and on physical exam there was inflammation
of the joint. Ortho was consulted again, as well as
rheumatology. R knee was tapped and fluid with 67,000 WBC (90%
PMNs), normal glucose and protein, positively birefringent
crystals, negative gram stain, but grew MRSA in culture a couple
of days later. Patient declined surgical wash out of the knee
and decided medical management. The following day the knee was
tapped again; fluid had 41,500 WBC (95% PMNs). Meeting took
place between paliative care, attending, daughters and patient
who decided not to proceed with any further aggresive treatment.
Antibiotics were stopped on [**6-5**] and patient status was changed
to CMO. Since then, patient has been stable and comfortable in
the floor.
