Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of mid
and apical anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35
%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on Mr.[**Known lastname 80255**] at 8AM.

Post Bypass:
Normal RV systolic function.
There is a mild improvement of the previously hypokinetic areas.
Mid and apical anteroseptal wall still akinetic.
Overall LVEF 40%.
Trivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Intact thoracic aorta.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Followup.

COMPARISON: [**2115-11-4**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left-sided
chest tube,
the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube and the Swan-Ganz
catheter has
been removed. The remaining is an introduction sheath in the
right internal
jugular vein. The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged,
the
retrocardiac lung areas, however, are better ventilated.
Unchanged extent of
a small left-sided pleural effusion. Focal parenchymal opacity
suggestive of
pneumonia are not seen. No evidence of pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-31**] and underwent CABG x3(Lima->LAD, SVG->Diag/OM)
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative report
for further details. He was transfered to the CVICU in stable
condition  requiring phenylephrine and propofol drips. Initially
to augment hemodynamic stability he required epinephrine and
levophed drips. TEE done at bedside did not show any signs of
tamponade. Left chest tube placed for effusion on POD #2.
Pressors were weaned off. Lines and drains were discontinued in
a timely fashion. He was gently diuresed toward his preop weight
and drips weaned off. He was started on abx for bilateral PNA on
POD # 3. Extubated on POD #4. Speech and swallow was consulted
for difficulty with swallowing after prolonged intubation. He
was later cleared for a regular diet. POD#5 he was transferred
to the SDU for further telemetry and recovery.The remainder of
his postoperative course was essentially uncomplicated. On POD#7
he was doing well and he was discharged to home with VNA. All
follow-up appointments were instructed.
