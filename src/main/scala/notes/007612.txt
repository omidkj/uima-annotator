Chief Complaint:
.
LLE ulcer and planned angiography
.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
.
Angiography and stenting of left lower extremity
.


History of Present Illness:
.
HPI: Ms. [**Known lastname 11791**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with past medical hx of HTN and PVD
s/p successful stenting of right CIA and EIA for critical limb
ischemia and right foot ulcer in [**6-1**] who presents today for LLE
ulcer and planned angiography in AM.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 11791**] is s/p stenting of the right CIA and EIA in [**6-1**].  She
originally presented to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) **] with critical limb
ischemia and right foot ulcer/cellulitus of her right foot.  She
underwent urgent angiography on [**2134-6-14**] which showed a 90%
tubular lesion of the right common illiac artery and occlusion
of the EIA after the bifurcation. Additionally, the CFA had
moderate diffuse disease.  The SFA was proximally occluded and
reconstituted at the popliteal artery.  The patient underwent
successful stenting of the right CIA and EIA, and recanalization
of the right SFA was unsuccessful. The patient returned to the
cath lab on [**6-18**] and had succesful stenting of the right SFA and
succesful PTA of the right anterior tibial artery.
.
Since the procedure in [**Month (only) **], her right foot ulcer has healed
well.  She is currently denying any pain in the right leg.  She
now presents with an ulcer on her left foot x 2 weeks as well.
Additionally, she complains of left leg pain at rest.  She is
now referred for LLE angiography and possible intervention.
.
ROS: The patient's daughter has noticed dyspnea on exertion for
the last few weeks and complained about one episode of
substernal chest pain last week (which is new) which resolved on
its own.  Pt denies PND, orthopnea, and edema.  No melena,
hematuria. Patient complains of episodes of lightheadedness
(occasionally closes her eyes and says, "I can't see, I'm blind
and dizzy".)
.

STUDIES:

CTA Chest/Ab/Pelvis, [**2134-12-13**]:
1. Aortic dissection, type B, extending from the junction of the
aortic arch and the descending aorta to just above the aortic
bifurcation.
2. The celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries
arise from the true lumen. The left renal artery most likely
also arises from the true lumen.
3. Small left pleural effusion, compatible with simple fluid,
although
dilution of blood products may also be considered.
4. Unchanged cardiomegaly with coronary artery calcifications
and mitral
valve annulus calcification.
5. Small right groin hematoma which does not appear to extend to
the muscles of the right thigh or hip, nor into the pelvis.
6. Nonspecific 2-mm pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe.
If clinically indicated, follow-up may be performed in 12
months.
.
CXR, [**2134-12-11**]: Aside from new small left pleural effusion and
left basal atelectasis, there has been no interval change since
[**12-9**].  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
longstanding.  Heart size top normal.  No pneumothorax.
.
CXR, [**2134-12-9**]:  No evidence for CHF or pneumonia.  Left basilar
atelectasis. Anterior eventration of right hemidiaphragm
.
LE Arterial Duplex, [**2134-12-9**]: No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or
arteriovenous fistula.  There is a 3-cm hematoma in the right
groin.
.
Cath/LE Angiography, [**2134-12-8**]:
1) Initial diagnostic angiography revealed mild to moderate left
iliac
and femoral artery disease with a long 100% calcified L SFA
stenosis and
100% popliteal stenosis with the collateral supply from the
profundus
and geniculate arteries.  The peroneal artery supplies the left
foot and
the AT and PT are occluded but reconstitute via collaterals.
2) Successful PTCA and stenting of the L SFA with a one 6.0 and
five 7.0
mm stents with postdilation with a 6.0 mm NC balloon.  Final
angiography
revealed <10% residual stenosis of the L SFA with normal flow
into the
popliteal artery and peroneal artery.  (see PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Mild to moderate left iliac and femoral artery disease.
2. 100% calcified stenosis of the L SFA and portion of the
popliteal
artery.
3. Widely patent peroneal artery that supplied the foot.
4. 100% occluded anterior tibial and posterior tibial artery.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the L SFA.
6. Return in 4 weeks for antegrade popliteal and anterior tibial

revascularization.
.
Femoral [**Month/Day/Year **] Ultrasound, [**2134-12-8**]: Subcutaneous hematoma.
Somewhat limited study due to subcutaneous swelling, however, no
definite evidence of AV fistula or pseudoaneurysm.
.
CXR, [**2134-12-7**]: Low lung volumes; No consolidations, normal heart
size, poor heart size; No pleural effusions, mild left
retrocardiac opacity representing atelectasis; No pneumonia or
CHF
.
Echo, [**2131**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic.  There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild-moderate ([**12-28**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.  IMPRESSION: At least mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Aortic valve sclerosis.
