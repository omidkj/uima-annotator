hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 70 y/o with striatonigral degeneration, J-tube, trach,
traceomalacia who initially p/w increased secretions, low-grade
temps and increased work of breathing x 10 days. Hx is per wife,
who is primary care taker.
.
Wife reports that sx started ~10 days pta with increased work of
breathing and increased secretions- having to suction more
frequently. She initially attributed this to allergies, but when
it did not improve she became concerned. She noticed that he was
requiring more O2 than normal to maintain O2 sats (generally on
2L O2 at night -> increased to 4L, occ requiring 6L at home) and
was requiring Nebs more frequently (Q6 -> Q4) Feels he has been
lethargic and less interactive than usual. Also reports low
grade fevers, Tm 100.3. Wife thinks swelling in legs has gotten
worse in past 10 days as well. Pt. started on Levaquin by PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**4-25**], but did not improve with this therapy.
.
In ED received Vancomycin and Zosyn and A/A Nebs and was
admitted to the medicine floor. This AM, while the RN was
suctioning the patient, she noted thick, yellow secretions, and
then the patient stopped breathing and "turned blue" for a
period of several seconds - less than one minute. She called a
code, continued to suction, and the patient began to breath
again, with improvement in coloration. His O2 saturations
rapidly improved to 96%. He was transferred to the ICU for
further evaluation/management.

.
[**4-28**] CXR - Extremely limited study due to positioning. Persistent
cardiomegaly and increased interstitial markings especially in
left lower lobe, which may represent cardiac failure; however,
early pneumonia cannot be totally excluded. The tip of
tracheostomy tube cannot be confidently identified due to
overlying chin. Please correlate clinically, and if necessary,
please repeat chest x-ray with better positioning.
.
[**2110-4-29**] Lower Extr. U/S - No evidence of DVT.
.
[**2110-5-14**]- CXR - Since the prior study the tracheostomy tube has
been changed. Tip is in adequate position. Lungs are grossly
clear. There has been improved aeration of the left lung base
since the prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 70 yo male with striatonigral degeneration, bed bound, s/p
J-tube and trach presents with episodes of hypoxia. His hospital
course, by problem, is as follows.
.
# Resp failure/Hypoxia:  The patient was found to have a
pseudomonal PNA, and his acute exacerbation was likely due to
plugging due to his thick secretions. He was treated with Zosyn
x 14 days, and Vancomycin x 10 days for his penumonia, with
substantial clinical improvement. He required ventilatory
support initially due to hypercarbia, however, he was able to be
weaned to trach mask by hospital day #13, and was stable on this
until [**Month/Day/Year **]. An important part of weaning the patient
involved Lasix (as he was significantly volume overloaded), he
required a range of 40 to 80 IV lasix daily until 3-4days prior
to [**Month/Day/Year **] where was transitioned to 20mg PO lasix daily.
Diamox was added(due to a significant metabolic alkalosis, with
serum HCO3 up to 49), and aggressive potassium chloride
repletion (to promote renal wasting of HCO3). By [**Month/Day/Year **], his
Venous blood gases were stable (Baseline pCO2 high 60s-low 70s),
and his secretions had improved. The diamox was discontinued
prior to [**Month/Day/Year **]. He was also maintained on frequent
suctioning/pulmonary toilet, nebulizers, pulmicort respules, and
glycopyrolate.
.
# Hypernatremia - In context of diuresis, the patient was
significantly hypernatremic (Na up to 150). This was treated
effectively with free water boluses on his tube feeds.
.
# Nigrostriatal Degeneration:  stable, the patient was continued
on his outpatient regimen of Sinemet, Mirapex, Ritalin
.
Hypothyroidism: Continued on Synthroid
.
GERD: continued on PPI (on [**Hospital1 **] dosing at home)
.
FEN: the patient was maintained on tube feeds per his home
regimen (Comply at 60cc/hr), which he tolerated well.
.
Access: L PICC was placed by radiology. He has required several
flourocopic PICC lines placed, and these have been very
difficult. As such, interventional radiology is reccomending
placement of an indwelling port for future hospitalizations.
This should be evaluated as an outpatient, and placed electively
at a time when the patient is not infected. At time of
[**Hospital1 **], PICC line was non-functional and was pulled prior to
going home.
