Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function is preserved. There is a well
seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] #19 supraanullar tissue). Visualization of the leaflets
is limited. No significant AI is appreciated. The aortic
contours of the ascending aorta appear intact, The study is
otherwise unchanged from prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for pleural effusions



Final Report
INDICATION: Status post CABG.

COMPARISON: [**2164-7-18**].

FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The patient is status post
CABG and
median sternotomy wires are intact. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is
stable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. There are small
bilateral
pleural effusions which have not appreciably changed and no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.



The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**7-16**] and underwent AVR/cabg x3 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Transferred to the CVICU in stable condition on phenylephrine
and propofol drips.Extubated later that day. She awoke with
garbled speech which slowly cleared over the next couple of
days. Neuro consult done. CT scan of head ruled out CVA.
Transferred to the floor on POD #3 to begin increasing her
activity level. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per
protocol. Was making good progress and was ready for discharge
to home the next day when she experienced sudden cardiac arrest
on the afternoon of POD #12. Full ACLS protocol was performed,
but she was unable to be resuscitated. Expired at 1:50 PM on
[**7-21**].
