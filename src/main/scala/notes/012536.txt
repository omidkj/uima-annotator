HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old
female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction,
history of multiple pneumonias, and back pain from vertebral
compression fractures for which she has been on narcotics
recently.  On [**2190-1-11**], she was found down by her son and was
unresponsive.  Emergency Medical Services was notified and
she was brought to the Emergency Department where she was
found to have pneumonia on x-ray.  She was hypoxic to the
80's.  She was initially admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.
In the Intensive Care Unit she had leukocytosis,
hyperkalemia, elevated CK's to 918, as well as hypoxia and
hypercapnia.  The Intensive Care Unit team felt her
presentation was most consistent with hypoventilation,
secondary to narcotic overuse.  She improved over the next
few days with intermittent [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure
as well as Levofloxacin for pneumonia.  She was given
frequent nebulized Albuterol and Atrovent therapies as well
as her twice a day nebulized N-acetylcysteine.  She was
continued on narcotic analgesics for back pain.  Following
her two day stay in the Intensive Care Unit, she was
transferred to the Medical Floor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She quit tobacco in [**2181**].  She lives alone.
She has a supportive family.  She is a retired salon
receptionist.  She is separated from her husband for more
than 30 years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:  She was an
elderly female wearing a non-rebreather mask, answering
questions appropriately, but occasionally closing her eyes
during the interaction.  She was oriented times three.
Temperature 98.4; blood pressure 112/54; pulse 98;
respirations 22; 86% saturation on room air but 100% on the
non-rebreather.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Mucous
membranes were dry, oropharynx clear, and no jugular venous
pressure elevation.  Pulmonary examination:  Diffuse
scattered rhonchi and wheezes throughout.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended, positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Trace edema.

LABS:  Complete blood count:  White blood cell count 21.1
with differential 88% neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, 2%
monocytes; hematocrit 35.6; platelets 398; PT 14; INR 1.3;
PTT 30.1; sodium 138; potassium 5.7; chloride 96; bicarbonate
34; BUN 26; creatinine 1.4; glucose 101; initial CK 918 with
an MB 18 which was an MB index of 2.0; troponin 0.04; finger
stick blood glucose 145; ALT 26; AST 44; alkaline phosphatase
108; amylase 119; albumin 3.3; serum tox screen positive for
tricyclic antidepressants; Arterial blood gases pH 7.32, PC02
67, PO2 375; urinalysis unremarkable; urine culture sterile;
CT angiogram revealed no pulmonary embolism, multifocal
pneumonia, question of congestive heart failure versus
bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia; CT of
head was without obvious mass, lesion, or hemorrhage; chest
x-ray showed an infiltrate in the right lower lobe as well as
decreased definition of the vasculature with the suggestion
of pulmonary edema; CT of cervical spine revealed no
fracture; electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 97
with left axis deviation, left anterior fascicular block and
no evidence of ischemia.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 61 year old female with multiple
pulmonary problems and chronic pain from spinal compression
fractures requiring narcotics who was found down hypoxic and
hypercapnic.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  Respiratory failure, both hypoxic and hypercapnic.  This
was felt to be secondary to hypoventilation of unclear cause.
Possible etiologies might have been overdose of narcotics or
hypoglycemic episode.  Syncope was entertained as a
possibility, but there was no evidence of precipitating cause
of this.  Unfortunately, the event was unwitnessed.
Echocardiogram showed mild left atrium dilation, normal left
ventricular thickness and cavity size, mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis, normal right ventricular size and
wall motion.  Aortic valve was normal.  Mild 1+ mitral
regurgitation was seen.  Pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined.  The mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis was felt to be consistent with a diffuse process,
i.e. toxic metabolic.  There were no structural cardiac
causes of syncope identified.  The patient was neither
lightheaded nor pre-syncopal for the duration of her
admission.

2.  Pneumonia.  Given the patient's elevated white count and
infiltrate on chest x-ray, as well as her hypoxia, the
patient was treated for a presumed pneumonia.  Sputum
cultures were not adequate to be interpretable.  She was
given a total three week course of Levofloxacin.

3.  Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient was continued on
[**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure throughout this admission.

4.  Back pain.  Patient continued on MS Contin 30 mg by mouth
twice a day as well as Percocet 2 tablets by mouth around
2:00 p.m. once daily.  She was given prescriptions for these
upon discharge.  She continued on Neurontin, Mexiletine, and
Nortriptyline for her neuropathic pain.

A follow-up x-ray of the lumbar spine was performed to
evaluate the possibility of a new fracture.  Although no new
fracture was seen, there was an abnormality at L2 and L3 that
was of uncertain significance.  Osteomyelitis could not be
ruled out so it was recommended to obtain a spine magnetic
resonance scan.  Unfortunately, this was not possible to
arrange in-house and will have to be performed as an
outpatient.  The patient was given the telephone number to
call for an appointment to get the follow-up magnetic
resonance scan.

5.  Thrush.  The patient developed thrush during this
admission and this was likely due to poor clearing of
secretions during her episode of unresponsiveness.  She was
given Nystatin with good resolution of the thrush and she was
given a follow-up course of this for four days.

6.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient was continued on regular
insulin sliding scale.

7.  Psychiatric.  The patient continued on Effexor at her
regular dose.
