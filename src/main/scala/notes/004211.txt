Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old male
patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**] who was referred for outpatient
cardiac catheterization which was performed on [**2123-2-8**].  The patient reported recent increase in exertional
chest pain over the past year.  Positive exercise tolerance
test was obtained in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year, and he was
referred for cardiac catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization on [**2123-2-9**], revealed left
ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, 50% left main,
occlusion and three-vessel coronary artery disease.   The
patient was subsequently discharged home and was admitted on
[**2123-2-22**], for coronary artery bypass graft.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  Non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Right lower extremity claudication.  History of bladder
cancer which was treated with radical cystectomy and
radiation therapy in [**2097**].  The patient is also a former
smoker.

PREOPERATIVE LAB VALUES:  White blood cell count 8.8,
hematocrit 34.8, platelet count 205; CHEM7 preoperatively was
with a sodium of 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 105, CO2 21,
BUN 27, creatinine 1.2; INR 0.91.

On [**2123-2-22**], the patient was admitted to the
Preoperative Holding Area and was subsequently taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
graft times four with a LIMA to the left anterior descending,
a vein to the LPL, vein to the OM3, and jump graft to the OM1
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].

Postoperatively the patient was transported from the
Operating Room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on
Propofol and Neo-Synephrine drip.

On postoperative day #1, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was in sinus rhythm with a first degree AV block,
and his vitals signs were unremarkable, and he remained on
Neo-Synephrine drip, low dose, for hypotension.  He was also
transfused 1 U packed red blood cells.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was noted to have an
elevation in his creatinine from a baseline of 1.1 to 1.5,
and his diuretics were held.  He had previously received one
postoperative dose of Lasix.  The patient began with
progressive pulmonary toilet.  His chest tubes were removed.
His Swan-Ganz catheter had been removed.

On [**2-25**], the patient was noted to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular response rate to the 130s.
He was treated with intravenous Amiodarone and p.o.
Lopressor.  He subsequently converted to normal sinus rhythm
after that episode and has not had further subsequent
episodes of atrial fibrillation.

On the same night, [**2-25**], the patient was noted to be
confused and agitated.  He had been transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit and was on the Telemetry Floor.  He was
treated with low-doses of Haldol, and the confusion resolved
after approximately 24-48 hours of treatment with Haldol.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable.  On [**2-26**],
he was noted to have a small left apical pneumothorax;
however, was oxygenating well on room air with an oxygen
saturation of 96%.  The patient began to ambulate and work
with Physical Therapy for cardiac rehabilitation.  Although
the patient has not had subsequent episodes of atrial
fibrillation, it was felt prudent to leave him on Amiodarone
for probably 4-6 weeks depending upon the patient's primary
cardiologist postdischarge.

The patient has continued to progress with physical therapy,
although not completely independent yet.  It was then
recommended that the patient go to a rehabilitation facility
for short-term cardiac rehabilitation.

The patient's condition today, [**2123-3-2**], is stable.  He
is in normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 57.  His blood
pressure is 144/60.  Neurologically the patient is completely
intact.  His Haldol had been discontinued, and he is alert
and oriented.  His lungs are clear to auscultation.  His
coronary exam is regular, rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is
benign.  His incisions are clean, dry, and intact.  His
sternum is stable.  He has 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.
Right lower extremity is with some ecchymosis noted.

Postoperatively the patient did have a rising creatinine
which peaked on [**2-28**] at 1.9.  On [**3-1**], it came down to
1.7 with some intravenous hydration, and today [**3-2**], it is
down to 1.6.  It is our recommendation that he have his
creatinine followed very closely over the next couple of
days.  The patient was not started on his Captopril, which he
was on preoperatively, and he was also not continued on any
diuretics because of his increasing creatinine.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metformin SR 500 mg p.o. q.d.,
Aspirin 300 mg p.o. q.d., Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d., this is to be continued for 4
weeks and then discontinued at the discretion of his primary
cardiologist, Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Tylenol 650 mg p.o.
q.4 hours p.r.n. pain, Lopressor 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Hydralazine 25 mg p.o. q.6 hours.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

FOLLOW-UP:  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] at
approximately four weeks postoperatively upon discharge from
the rehabilitation facility at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 170**].  He is also to
follow-up with his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], upon
discharge from the rehabilitation facility, and he is to
follow-up with his primary cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4469**],
approximately four weeks postoperatively.
