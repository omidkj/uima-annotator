History of Present Illness:
75 yo female with hx of lung adenoCA s/p lobectomy, CAD s/p CABG
and LAD stent, carotid stenosis, afib, PE who presents with
hypotension after bronchoscopy with lymph node biopsy. She was
in her usual state of health until presentation to the hospital
yest for elective bronchoscopy with lymph node FNA. During the
procedure she was given a total of 3mg of versed and 100mg of
Fentanyl and had mild hypotension with SBP's in the 90s so was
given 250cc bolus of NS periprocedure. While in recovery the
patient was mildy dizzy and felt the urge to defacate. As she
was getting up to go to the bathroom she felt presyncopal and
nauseas and layed down. Symptoms improved when laying down, and
she denied any CP, CT, palpitations but did feel diaphoretic.
She was given an aspirin and vital signs revealed HR 58-64 and
SBP 78-95. She was given another 500cc bolus with no improvement
in SBP so she was sent to the ED for further evaluation. Prior
to admisssion she reports some baseline DOE since her lobectomy
but was otherwise feeling well. She had been admitted to an OSH
6 weeks ago for PNA and developed diarrhea from the antibiotics
without black or bloody stool but this all resolved 3 weeks ago.

.
In the ED she was persistently hypotensive and was administered
2L NS and ECG revealed new TWI in V2-4. CXR revealed no CHF,
infiltrate, or pneumothorax. Due to persistent hypotension with
no clear source she was admitted to the ICU for further
monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ICU, she was observed and her anti-hypertensives were
held yesterday. Her BPs ranged in the 120-150s, and her HR
remained 70s-110s.  Her metoprolol was restarted and she was
called out to the floor.  On the floor, she was initially put on
short-acting diltiazem which was then switched back to her home
regimen of sustained-release diltiazem.  She was monitored on
telemetry and was rate-controlled with HR 60s-80s by the time of
discharge.  She was noted to be hyponatremic, but this was at
baseline.  She was initially thought to have a hematocrit drop,
but this was confirmed to be a lab anomaly.  She will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] next week.
