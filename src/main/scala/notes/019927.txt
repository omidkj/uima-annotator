HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old male,
who presents with symptoms of near syncopal episodes since
[**2144-12-15**] with progression of frequency of the
symptoms for the one week prior to admission.  Symptoms
constitute near syncopal episodes less than 15-20 seconds
while sitting up to eat, but denies loss of consciousness
with the episodes.  Episodes are associated with weakness in
the right hand and a new left hand tremor.  Patient also
experienced episodes with standing and limited ambulation
complaining of extreme dizziness and falling towards the
right.

Episodes have been increasing in frequency for seven days
prior to admission approximately at 2-3x/day.  Past carotid
ultrasounds demonstrated a right carotid artery disease of
65%, a left carotid disease with plaque at the origin of the
ICA and common carotid artery.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. CABG in [**2135**].

3. Left below the knee amputation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, patient is an obese
male in no apparent distress alert and oriented times three.
Head was normocephalic, atraumatic with no scleral icterus.
Neck was large, soft, and supple.  No masses noted.
Bilateral carotid bruits.  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6
systolic ejection murmur at the base with no radiation.
Abdomen was obese, nontender, and nondistended.  Bowel sounds
x4 and no pulsatile mass noted.  Rectal examination was
guaiac negative.  Extremity examination was significant for
well-healed scars on the legs and a well-healed sternotomy
scar.  Pulse examination was significant for 1+ carotid
pulses bilaterally with carotid bruits.  Radial pulses were
dopplerable bilaterally.  Femoral pulses were 2+ on the right
and dopplerable on the left.  Extremity pulses:  Right graft
was palpable, 3+, and DP and PT were dopplerable.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the
Vascular Surgery service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] attending, and was
scheduled for bilateral carotid ultrasound.  It was also
noted on admission that the patient's fingerstick glucose
levels ranging between 280 and 400 were very poorly
controlled.  Patient was placed on insulin drip to titrate
for a sugar less than 200 and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for sugar
management.  In addition, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient's cardiologist was
consulted in order to clear the patient for surgery incase a
carotid endarterectomy was necessary.

Carotid ultrasounds performed on [**2145-1-6**] revealed
significant bilateral plaque.  On the right, there is an
80-99% carotid stenosis.  On the left by velocity criteria,
there is also an 80-99% carotid stenosis.  However, this may
be artifactually elevated due to the high grade stenosis on
the contralateral side.  After initial treatment, repeat
ultrasound on the left side would be recommended.

Patient, after interpreting these results, was made
preoperative for right carotid endarterectomy.  Patient was
taken to the OR on [**2145-1-7**] after adequate cardiac clearance
and preoperative workup.

On [**2145-1-7**] the patient was taken for a right carotid
endarterectomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**].  For more detailed account,
please see operative note.  Postoperatively, patient went to
the Vascular ICU, where patient's postoperative course was
remarkable for 2 unit blood transfusion requirement.

Also postoperatively, patient's sugars were well controlled
ranging from 150-200 on the new sliding scale and fixed
insulin doses arranged for by the [**Last Name (un) **] consult.

On postoperative day #4, patient was doing well with no
complaints.  The right neck wound was clean, dry, and intact
with some moderate ecchymoses but no swelling and no
neurological deficits noted.  The patient was deemed well
enough to be discharged home at this time.
