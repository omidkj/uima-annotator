History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 88899**] is a 49 yo M w/ h/o metastatic renal cell carcinoma
s/p radical nephrectomy, Cyberknife, currently receiving whole
brain irradiation who presents after a syncopal episode and
recurrent vomiting. Patient has had multiple sessions of
radiation therapy this week and has noticed progressive weakness
and nausea. Began vomiting on the day of admission, prior to and
during XRT. Received dexamethasone and was able to complete
therapy but went home and continued to vomit non-bloody, bilious
fluid. Poor POs, but prior had been good. Recalls going to the
bathroom and feeling "hot and dizzy" and awoke on the floor w/
chipped tooth and bloody lip. No tongue biting, loss of
continence. Per wife, heard a crash and then a shout and found
the patient face down on the floor. Pt felt too weak to get up
and could not remember the episode. Unclear if LOC as episode
was unwitnessed. Denies fever, abdominal pain, CP, SOB,
palpitations, and diarrhea.
.
In the ED, inital vitals were, 98.6 130 95/72 18 98%. Pt
triggered on arrival for tachycardia to the 140s. He was found
to have new AF on EKG. He was given 10 of IV dilt which brought
his rate to the 120s but dropped his pressures to the 70s/40s.
With 3L fluid his BPs returned to the 90s systolically. He was
seen by cardiology who did not feel his hypotension was related
to his AF. Bedside echo was done which was negative for
effusion, RV strain, and LV dysfunction. Labs notable for
creatinine 1.6, WBC 11.7 (86% polys), hct 36.6, and INR 3.0.
Guaiac negative. CXR and UA were clear. CT head was negative for
acute bleed. A central line was placed and pt was started on
levophed for persistent hypotension. Also received solumedrol
100 mg, vancomycin, zosyn, and zofran for nausea. On transfer
was receiving 5th liter of NS and levophed was running at 0.7
mcg/kg/min. VS on transfer were: T98.9 HR100 BP 138/74 RR22 O2
sat98% on RA.
.
On the floor, pt reports he is tired but w/o any pain or
discomfort. No current CP, SOB, nausea, HA, abd pain, or
palpitations. Heart feels a little "odd" though.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI; + for headaches, weight loss of 35 lbs since [**Month (only) 205**].

(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies sinus tenderness,
rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or

Past Medical History:
* Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma s/p laporoscopic radical
nephrectomy, cyber knife and whole brain irradiation
- [**2120-7-5**]: presented to [**Hospital6 1597**] with cold left arm,
found to have brachial and radial tumor thrombi in his left arm,
s/p thrombectomy.  CT revealed a 11.4 x 8.6 cm right kidney
enhancing mass with central necrosis and calcification,
pulmonary
and adrenal metastases and lytic lesions in his right acetabulum
and lesser trochanter.  He was also noted to have thrombus in
the
superior pulmonary vein.  A TTE showed an atrial PFO.  MRI Brain
showed multifocal intracranial metastases.  Biopsy of L arm
thrombus confirmed poorly differentiated carcinoma.
- [**2120-7-24**]: XRT to R hip, 5 treatments
- [**2120-8-1**]: Cyberknife to brain mets
- [**2120-8-9**]: Laparoscopic right radical nephrectomy with
adrenalectomy with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**].

.
[**2120-9-17**] Abd/pelvis w/o contrast: PFI: 1. Stable-to-minimally
increased right retroperitoneal hematoma, non-drainable.
2. Lytic metastasis in the right lesser trochanter, right
acetabulum, and left sacrum.
.
[**2120-9-13**] CTA: CTA chest/CT Torso w/ con wetread showed:
1. New filling defect in the left main pulmonary artery
extending into the left anterior pulmonary segment consistent
with pulmonary embolism. No associated right heart strain.
2. Increased size of the previously noted left superior
pulmonary vein filling defect, now extending into the main
pulmonary vein, consistent with clot.
3. Multiple pulmonary nodules as described above in greater
detail.
4. Right retroperitoneal 9.2-cm hematoma at the site of recent
right
adrenalectomy and nephrectomy with high-density contents
consistent with more acute hemorrhage. No site of active
extravasation noted. High-density rim likely reflects
organization of thrombus/hematoma; however, superimposed
infectious process cannot be excluded..
.
[**2120-9-12**] CXR: A RIJ central line has been placed, tipped
projected SVC. No infiltrates or effusions. Cardiac silhouette
within normal limits. No acute pulmonary process.
.
[**2120-9-12**] CT Head: (wet read) 1. No ICH. 2. Small hypodensities of
the R basal ganglia, R occiptial lobe, and L parietal lobe -
most compatible with prior infarct
