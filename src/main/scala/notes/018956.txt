History of Present Illness:
79 M w/ PMH of afib on coumadin, HTN, hyperlipidemia, angina,
s/p Vfib arrest with immed bystander [**Month/Year (2) **] X 20 minutes.  Family
found pt unresponsive w/ max 2 minutes of unobserved time.  s/p
7 shocks in the field by EMS (12:38 pm) and intubated w/ vec
given.  + intentional movements by report.  Given epi and
atropine X 1.  Converted to Narrow-complex tachycardia after
shocks HR 124, BP 172/117.  Given amio X 1 300 mg IV.  At OSH,
was PEA on arrival so [**Month/Year (2) **] started and given epi/atropine.
Hypotensive since arrest, arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] on levo and dopa
ggts.  CT heat at OSH w/o bleed.  Guiac neg at OSH. Cooling
initiated at OSH.  Also given versed at OSH (13:05).
.
In the ED, received amio load and was continued on dopa and levo
ggts and taken to the cath lab.  Cath showed chronic occlusion
of LAD with mod diffuse disease of LCX and RCA.  An IABP was
placed for cardiogenic shock.
.
Per family, had been feeling unwell for the past few days.  He
apparently suffers from chronic stable angina but had complained
of increased chest pain when shoveling this am.  He called his
daughter before driving to his family's [**Holiday 944**] gathering.  He
asked them to come get him if he wasn't there in one hour.  He
also brought his medical record to the gathering.  He arrived
and helped to bring in packages.  When seated with his family,
he was noted to fall asleep which is not unusual for him.  His
son then noted that he looked cyanotic.  His daughter, who is a
nurse, along with his granddaughter who is also a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]

prior to [**Last Name (Titles) **]).  His daughter thinks he may have been "asleep"
for up to 10 minutes before [**Last Name (Titles) **] was started.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2106-2-1**] 9:52 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p Chest tube removal

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p Chest tube removal
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Follow up of a patient after CABG after
removal of the chest tube and mediastinal drains.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2106-1-30**] and
to pre- operative radiograph from [**2106-1-23**].

The patient was extubated in the meantime interval with removal
of mediastinal drains, NG tube and chest tube. The heart size is
moderately enlarged but stable. The post-sternotomy wires are
unremarkable. The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.
Bibasal opacities including discoid atelectasis in the left base
most likely represent post-surgery atelectasis. Small right
pleural effusion is noted. There is no pneumothorax. There is no
evidence of congestive heart failure.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasal atelectasis, postsurgical.

2. No pneumothorax. Small left upper chest subcutaneous
emphysema.

3. No evidence of congestive heart failure.

interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Markedly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be A-V paced. Emergency study. Results were personally
Conclusions
Limited examination in the OR

1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25 %).

2.The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.

3.There is no pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
He remained intubated with IABP and was diuresed. He was seen by
cardiac surgery. He awaited normal INR. His IABP was dc'd and he
was extubated on [**1-26**]. He developed a fever and was cultured
and started on empiric antibiotics. He was taken to the
operating room on [**1-29**] where he underwent a CABG x 2 and MAZE
procedure. He was transferred to the ICU. He was given 48 hours
of perioperative vancomycin since he was in the hospital
preoperatively. He became unstable and was reopened at the
bedside, and was taken back to the OR for hematoma evacuation
and oversew of the area of bleeding in the left upper lobe
parenchyma. He was transferred back the ICU. He was extubated on
POD #1. His vasoactive drips were weaned and He was transferred
to the floor on POD #3.  He was started on coumadin and
amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. He was ready for discharge
to rehab on POD # 5.

Medications on Admission:
Diltiazem 240', Coumadin 3.75-5mgs daily, Lovastatin 20',
Atenolol 25', ASA 81', HCTZ 25
