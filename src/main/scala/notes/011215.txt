Date of Birth:  [**2135-10-29**]             Sex:   M

Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. DC cardioversion
2. Intubation
3. Right femoral central line


History of Present Illness:
63 yo M with CHF (EF~28%) from nonischemic cardiomyopathy with
h/o VFib, s/p ICD placement ([**9-11**]) who presented to OSH with
severe SOB and CP. Pt initially received NTG SL x 3, ASA 325,
Lasix 80 mg IV, and later lasix 160 mg IV x 2 presumably for CHF
exacerbation. Pt was also found to be in rapid AFib to the
130's. For this he received Diltiazem 15 mg IV followed by a gtt
and then became hypotensive to 76/56 and received NS boluses x
2L and a dopamine gtt was started. Pt was also loaded on amio
and put on a gtt in addition to receiving Zaroxylin, Ativan,
Narcan, and lidocaine for unclear reasons. Pt was intubated for
respiratory distress (O2sat recorded as 60's - ? if on RA), then
he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on dopa with HR in the 120's with
frequent ventricular ectopy. Dopa was weaned off in the ED and
HR dropped to the 80's and PVC's decreased.
     Pt had previously been treated at [**Hospital1 2177**] [**9-11**] for VFib arrest.
He was resuscitated and was found to have insignificant CAD, and
a TEE showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and moderate MR, depressed LVEF quantified
as 28% by ETT MIBI. TTE showed mildly dilated LV, mild LVH, EF
30-35%, 3+ MR.

Past Medical History:
CHF - EF ~20%
HTN
VF arrest
s/p shocks and ICD placement.


Social History:
Obtained from daughter:
Pt recently moved to [**Name (NI) 86**] from [**Location (un) 7349**] and lives with his 2
daughters. Pt was a heavy smoker (unk # ppd) x more than 30-50
years. Drinks moderate amt of EtOH.

Family History:
Denies FHx of CAD or HTN.

Physical Exam:
96.6 HR: 80's BP: 92/50 wt: 90 kg.
Resp: AC at RR 12, TV 700, FiO2 100%, PEEP 5
Gen: intubated, sedated.
HEENT: PERRLA, no sceral icterus. Carotid pulses palpable, no
bruits heard.
Neck: no lymphadenopathy
CV: RRR, No M/R/G appreciated, though vent was loud.
Lungs: coarse BS bilaterally.
Abd: S/ND. +BS. No HSM
Ext: 1+ edema B LE. Pulses 1+ bilaterally DP/PT.
Neuro: sedated. Not responding to pain.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2199-10-27**]) Moderate pulmonary edema and small right pleural
effusion.

RUQ ultrasound:
The liver is normal in size, architecture and echogenicity.
There are no focal liver lesions seen. There is no evidence for
ascites, portal hypertension, or splenomegaly. The portal vein
is patent with hepatopetal flow.

The head and body of the pancreas are normal in appearance but
the tail is obscured by gas. The aorta is of normal dimensions.
There is some sludge seen within the gallbladder which is
otherwise unremarkable with no stones or wall thickening. The
biliary tract is normal with the common hepatic duct measuring 4
mm.

The right kidney shows a small simple cyst in the interpolar
region measuring 1.3 cm in largest diameter. The right kidney is
otherwise normal measuring 10.6 cm in length. The left kidney is
also normal measuring 11 cm.

CONCLUSION: The study shows evidence of sludge within the
gallbladder. No other biliary abnormalities. The liver is normal
in appearance and there are no signs of portal hypertension or
ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo AAM with HTN, CHF with EF ~30% due to cardiomyopathy of
unknown etiology with somewhat acute SOB and CP, transferred
from OSH on pressors and amio gtt.
1. CV:
A. pump - CHF - By history and CXR appeared to have
decompensated CHF. TTE at OSH [**9-11**] showed EF of 30% with diffuse
hypokinesis. Etiology of cardiomyopathy was thought to be EtOH
induced cardiomypathy which then led to Afib since pt admitted
to heavy drinking in the past (15-20 glasses of run and scothch
qday) but stated over the past few years he has cut back.
Etiology of the acute decompensation was postulated to be
acutely increased rate of AFib with flash pulm edema. Pt was
diuresed with lasix and improved symptomatically. Lisinopril was
restarted with no complications. He was discharged with Lasix 20
po daily and Lisinopril 40 po daily. He will be followed by
cardiology.

B. rhythm: AFib. Pt was weaned off of pressors and subsequently
became rate controlled with a small dose of Coreg. A TEE was
performed and showed no intra-atrial thrombi and so pt was
loaded with 150mg IV Amiodarone and subsequently shocked with
200 J and then 300J and returned to sinus rhythm. Pt was
restarted on coumadin. He was seen by EP and ICD was
interrogated and found to be functioning well. DFT testing was
performed and was found to be around 17. Since pt was started on
amio LFT's were checked and ALT was found to be elevated at 137.
AST was wnl at 33. Pt had RUQ u/s which showed only gall bladder
sludge but no abnml architecture of the liver. Pt was found to
be positive for HAV Ig. The decision was made to continue pt on
amio but to have him follow up and obtain PFT's as outpt as well
as close watch of LFT's. It was also recommended that he wear a
[**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts monitor as an outpt. He remained in NSR for the
remainder of his stay and was asymptomatic. He was discharged
with amio and Toprol 25 qd.

2. Pulm: After successful cardioversion and diuresis pt was
extubated without difficulty. CXR showed marked improvement of
pulmonary edema. He denied SOB and felt back to baseline at d/c.


3. Renal: Cr range at OSH was 0.8 to 1.3. On admission was 1.4.
Elevation likely [**3-11**] poor perfusion of kidneys and with improved
hemodynamics Cr returned to 1.1 before discharge.
