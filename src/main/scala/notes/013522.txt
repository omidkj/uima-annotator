Breify Summary of HPI and Hospital Course:  History and Physical
per night float. After recieiving Diazepam/Olanzipine/Haldol
last night surronding Code [**Name (NI) 50119**] (pt tried to leave hospital)
pt is extremely sedated this AM and is unable to answer
historical questions.
.
Per nightfloat note [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. This is a 59 year old man who
was found unconscious by EMS. Upon arrival in the ED he was
responsive and combative. At that time, he made comments about
having been attacked by someone with a baseball bat. Shortly
thereafter, he had a generalized tonic clonic seizure in the ED.
He was intubated for airway protection and stabilized with
lorazepam and propofol. A serum and urine tox screens were
positive for alcohol, benzodiazepine, cocaine, and opiates. He
became diaphoretic and hypertensive after intubation, but this
resolved with additional lorazepam. A CT head and neck showed no
fractures on wet read. He was given folic acid, thiamine,
saline, and transfered to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient cleared by trauma surgery, but
complained of c-spine tenderness. As a result, was maintained in
a c-collar and spine curbsided regarding MRI to r/o c-spine
injury. Ultimately cleared for MRI which showed no major
concerning findings and c-collar was discontinued. Patient was
continued intuabated during most of this time, and was only
extubated after c-spine cleared. Course complicated by fever in
ICU and evolving RLL infiltrate that manifested on hospital day
1. Impression was for aspiration pneumonia. Patient was covered
with vanco/ctx/flagyl initially and narrowed to CTX/flagyl after
sputum cultures grew moraxella. Patient extubated on [**2183-11-28**]
with extended intubation generally atributable to need to obtain
cervical MRI rather than respiratory distress. Patient's course
further complicated by etoh withdrawal requiring q1 valium after
extubation. Has been tolerating q4H valium for the past 12
hours. Received a total of 105mg valium from midnight [**11-30**] to
time of call out and a total of 175mg on [**2183-11-29**]. Total valium
for last three days is approximately: 350mg. Ultimately,
patient's identify was confirmed by nursing staff, as [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 30258**]
who reportedly is frequently admitted with etoh intoxication
although medical record information not available currently.
Patient is now called out to the medical floor for management.
Review of previous medical records reveals multiple admissions
for etoh inoxication, seizures, and discharges AMA on times from
ICU.

Studies:
CXR ([**11-27**]): New subtle opacity within the right lower lobe may
represent an early infiltrative process.

CXR ([**11-30**])In comparison with the study of [**11-29**], there is a
decrease in the
right basilar consolidation, consistent with resolving
aspiration pneumonia.  The left base now is essentially clear.

CT Cspine([**2183-11-26**]): 1. No acute fracture or traumatic
malalignment.
2. Exuberant ossification of the ALL, from C5/6 through C7/1,
likely related to underlying DISH (based on limited single AP
radiograph of the chest); though this is interrupted, there is
no evidence of acute fracture.

CT Head ([**2183-11-26**]): 1. No acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Chronic microvascular and lacunar infarction.
3. Chronic sinus inflammatory disease.

CT T/L spine ([**2183-11-26**]): 1. No evidence of acute vertebral
compression fracture or other injury involving the thoracolumbar
spine.
2. Prominent Schmorl nodes in the L1 and L2 superior endplates,
with
associated chronic-appearing compression and anterior wedge
deformity, but no spinal canal compromise.
3. L4-5: Multifactorial severe spinal canal and left more than
right neural foraminal stenosis, with significant compression of
the thecal sac and likely impingement upon the exiting left L4
nerve root. 4. Likely forme fruste DISH involving the
thoracolumbar spine, with evident
fusion at the L5-S1 level, incompletely imaged.
5. Paraseptal emphysema at the left lung apex and evident
bibasilar dependent atelectasis, chronic bronchiectasis and
scarring, which may relate to prior aspiration episodes, and
apparent interlobular septal thickening, of unclear
significance; these findings are incompletely imaged.

MRI Cspine ([**11-28**]): Ossification of the anterior longitudinal
ligaments with associated degenerative chagnes, but without
evidence of ligamentous injury or an acute fracture or
dislocation. There is no evidence of spinal cord compromise.
