Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lorazepam

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old male with COPD (home O2), thoracic
aortic aneyeurism, CAD (fixed defect), ESRD on HD, recent
c.diff, who presents from HD with increased respiratory
secretions and tachycardia.  All previous care at [**Hospital3 9947**].  He came to [**Hospital1 18**] with a personal care assistant.  He
has a history of CO2 retention a few months ago that responded
to BiPAP.  Also noted to have increased heart rate at the end of
dialysis today.  As per nurse, "he looked abnormal with stomach
breathing" at the dialysis center.  No fevers, chills, CP, or
cough.

In the ER he was transiently hemodynamically unstable with HR
120's and BP 80's/40's but responded to IVF resusitation.  Spike
to 104 and was started on vanc/levo/flagyl He was found to have
melena with a Hct of 21.  A PEG lavage was negative for blood,
but there was no biliary return.  He was then transfered to the
MICU where he had another episode of melena.  He was transfused
2 unit of PRBC at this time. He is s/p ddavp and PPI. An EGD was
postponded due to patients poor respiratory status at the time,
where he was requiring BiPAP ventilations.  A CT scan ruled out
a leaking aortic aneyureusm.  VBG 7.44/58/37 and ABG 7.42/56/95.
 S/p 5 units PRBCs to stabalize HCT at 28.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2174-7-4**] ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2174-7-2**] MRI - No evidence of acute infarct. Chronic right
posterior cerebral artery territory infarct with chronic laminar
necrosis visualized on the T1-weighted images. Chronic right
cerebellar infarct and evidence of previous hemorrhage in the
right corona radiata and basal ganglia region. Chronic infarcts
in the pons with atrophy of the pons. Dolichoectasia of
intracranial arteries with probable chronic occlusive disease in
the basilar artery.
[**2174-7-1**] EGD - Erythema and congestion in the stomach body
compatible with gastritis.  No evidence of active bleeding.
[**2174-6-25**] CXR (admission) - Small right pleural effusion.  No
definite aspiration pneumonia, or evidence of congestive
failure.  If symptoms persist, a PA and lateral radiograph of
the chest would be helpful for further evaluation.
[**2174-6-25**] CTA abdomen/Chest - IMPRESSION: 1. Thoracic ascending and
descending aortic aneurysm without evidence of dissection or
hematoma. 2. Findings consistent with CHF on a background of
COPD. 3. Numerous enlarged lymph nodes seen within the
mediastinum and abdomen. 4. Diverticulosis without
diverticulitis. 5. Small left inguinal/pelvic hematoma.
[**2174-6-25**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

Right bundle branch block Inferior infarct - age undetermined
Consider septal infarct - age undetermined No previous tracing
[**2174-6-26**] CXR - Moderate right-sided pleural effusion and a small
left pleural effusion. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
[**2174-6-28**] CXR - Cardiomegaly with small bilateral pleural effusion
but no overt failure. No significant interval change

Cultures:
[**2174-6-25**] Urine - <10,000 organisms
[**2174-6-25**] Blood - STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.
