Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
74 F with history of HTN, DM, OSA, COPD, obesity,
hypothyroidism, HL, OA, GERD presents from nursing home with
noted for hypoxia.  Patient was found to be hypoxic to 86% on 3L
NC, and also to be increasingly somnolent.  Patient was given
one nebulizer treatment which improved her oxygenation to 91%.
Fingerstick was 130.  Patient reports that she felt tired and
that she feels "strange", but is unable to elaborate.  Denies
any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers.  Feels that her cough
is a little worse than usual, slightly short of breath.
.
In the ED her initial vitals were: 98.6, 88, 126/72, 22, 92% 4L.
 She was noted to be somnolent, but arousable.  CXR read did not
show any infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.  Patient
desaturated to the high 80's, was increased to 5L, then
subsequently placed on BiPAP.  ABG taken while patient was on 5L
and while patient was on BiPAP both showed PCO2 in the 90s.
Respiratory therapy worked with vent settings, but unable to
increase minute ventilation.  Patient also received levofloxacin
500 mg, vancomycin 1 gram, solumedrol 125 mg x1, duonebs x3, and
ASA 325 PR.  On tranfer to the unit, patient's respiratory
status was 14 breaths/min, saturating 91% on CPAP (15/5, fio2
30%)
.
In the MICU, patient was somnolent, confused, unable to clearly
answer questions.  She only reports that she felt that her
breathing was difficult and that she felt strange.  [**Name (NI) **]
HCP/daughter was [**Name (NI) 653**] in order to discuss code status.
Given patient's continued respiratory distress, she was
intubated.

Pertinent Results:
[**2178-2-17**]: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Cardiomegaly with bibasilar
atelectasis. Low inspiratory lung volumes. Assessment of lung
bases is limited, and consider repeat evaluation with improved
inspiration when the patient is able to take deeper breaths.
.
[**2178-2-17**]: EKG - NSR at 85, left axis, nl intervals, <1mm
nonspecific ST depression in lateral leads


Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure - While in the ED, PaCO2
remained high in the 90s despite increased O2 and BiPAP.  Likely
COPD exacerbation given no evidence of PNA on CXR.  Also with
past admission for CHF, but not currently appearing to be volume
overloaded.  Pt intubated on arrival to the MICU for continued
respiratory distress on CPAP.  Weaned to CPAP on [**2-18**], and
extubated on [**2-19**]. Given solumedrol 60 mg Q8h and levofloxacin
750 mg q24h x 7 days for presumed COPD exacerbation. Steroids
decreased to prednisone 60mg daily and taper started on [**2-20**].
Patient remained hemodynamically stable with good oxygenation.
.
# Hypertension - home doses of amlodipine, metoprolol,
lisinopril held while patient intubated.  Restarted on [**2-19**].
.
# Diabetes mellitus - diet controlled at home.  Placed on ISS
while in the hospital.
.
# Hypothyroidism  - continued levothyroxine.
.
# Gout - Allopurinol restarted on [**2-19**].
.
# Depression - Antidepressant restarted on [**2-19**].
.
# FEN/GI - Speech and swallow evaluation after extubation, they
suggested soft solids given she lost her dentures and thin
liquids.
