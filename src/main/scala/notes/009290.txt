History of Present Illness:
48 year old woman with chronic back, leg pain, on multiple meds
for pain syndrome who was found by her daughter on [**7-25**] to be
somnolent. Called EMS and in ED found to be lethargic in setting
of taking [**7-18**] Vicodin and an unknown amount of trazadone,
Seroquel, and Neurotin. Due to slurred speech and somnolence in
ED, patient was intubated for airway protection. Before being
intubated, she denied suicidal ideation, although per patient's
sister, history of suicidal ideation.  In the ED, temperature
97, HR 116, BP 140/87, RR 17, and oxygen saturation 98% on room
air. Tylenol level was 80 and her urine was positive for
benzodiazepines, opiates, and amphetamines. Her EKG was
unremarkable. She had minimal response to 0.4mg of Narcan, given
twice. She received 50 mg of charcoal and was started on 13gm
(14mg/kg) of NAC by mouth.

Other labs:

TSH-2.0

EKG [**7-25**]: Sinus tachycardia, rate 103. Since the previous
tracing of [**2183-3-31**] the heart rate is faster. Technical artifacts
are present. Minimal increase in ST-T wave abnormalities is
present

Radiology:
[**7-25**] CXR: An ET tube has been placed with tip 6.3 cm above the
carina, above the level of the clavicular heads. The tube could
be advanced approximately 3 cm to ensure proper positioning. An
NG tube traverses below the diaphragm with tip off the field of
view. The lungs are grossly clear and there is no evidence of
consolidations or edema. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
compared to the prior exam, though this may be due to technique.
Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.

[**7-26**] Head CT w/o contrast: There is no intracranial hemorrhage.
There is no mass effect, shift of normally midline structures,
hydrocephalus, or acute vascular territorial infarct. The
density values of the brain parenchyma are normal, and the
ventricles and basal cisterns are unremarkable. Fluid secretions
within the posterior nasopharynx and oropharynx are likely
related to patient's intubated status. Visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise normally aerated.

[**7-27**] CXR: Comparison with the previous study done [**2183-7-26**]. The
lungs remain clear. The heart and mediastinal structures are
unremarkable. The left hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated. An
endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old female with chronic pain (back, leg, foot) initially
admitted [**7-26**] to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being found somnolent in the setting
of multiple drug ingestion (Vicodin, trazodone, Seroquel,
Neurontin).

1) Polysubstance overdose: Patient is on multiple psychiatric
meds (see admission med list), in addition to Vicodin and
neurontin. Urine tox screen was positive for amphetamines,
opiates, and benzodiazepines, and serum tox was notable for a
Tylenol level of 80. A toxicology consult was obtained and the
patient was started on N-acetylcysteine for Tylenol overdose and
a dose of charcoal. She was intubated in the emergency room and
transferred to the intensive care unit. She was extubated on
[**2183-7-26**] without difficulty. Her liver function tests remained
normal, and N-acetylcysteine was discontinued. She was
transferred to the general medical floor on [**2183-7-28**]. Psychiatry
followed the patient closely throughout her hospital stay.
Although the patient denies intentional overdose, she
acknowledges multiple recent social stressors and passive
suicidality, raising concern that this overdose represented a
suicide attempt. Psychiatry therefore recommended section 12 and
psychiatric admission.

2) Bipolar disorder: As recommended by psychiatry, all of the
patient's psychiatric medications were discontinued. Her
psychiatric medications will be re-started/titrated once she is
transferred to a psychiatric facility.

3) Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on levothyroxine;
recent TSH wnl

4) Asthma: The patient has a chronic cough attributed to asthma.
CXR was without infiltrate. She was continued on flovent and
albuterol and was started on atrovent. She may benefit from
outpatient PFTs (last obtained in [**2178**]).

5) Anemia: At time of discharge, the patient's hematocrit was
stable. Although ferritin was low at 15, iron/TIBC were normal.
This should be monitored as an outpatient and further work-up of
occult bleeding pursued at the discretion of the patient's
primary care physician. [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] B12 and folate were normal.

6) Disposition:  The patient is medically stable for transfer to
psychiatric facility.
