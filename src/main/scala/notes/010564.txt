CXR: Massive LA enlargement with possible present pulmonary
hypertension, could be due to mitral valve regurgitation


Brief Hospital Course:
1) C. diff colitis: Pt with copious diarrhea despite PO vanco.
Added IV Flagyl at the recommendation of ID. Abd CT [**1-8**] with
wall thickening and adjacent inflammatory stranding of the

both po vanco and flagyl for a 2 week course.
.
2) GI bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleeding dating
back to [**10-6**] when he was admitted with BRBPR - EGD w/
gastritis/duodenitis with erosions, colonoscopy w/
diverticulosis, tagged RBC scan negative, and abd CT (-).
Readmitted [**11-6**] w/ rectal bleeding, resolved spontaneously.
Current episode likely due to C. diff + coumadin; per
cardiologist ([**Doctor Last Name **]) needs to be anti-coagulated, but aiming
lower INR goal 1.5-2. HCT now stable. Follow up for colonoscopy
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-5**] weeks.

evidence of active bleeding. Vit B12/folate high; given h/o abnl
SPEP, recheking SPEP and UPEP.
.
6) Candidal UTI: continue diflucan per ID (day [**4-7**]). Per ID not
treating VRE (10-100k) given they think it is a colonizer.
Repeat UA after Foley removed positive, but will have UCx
followed up from [**Hospital1 1501**] as he is currently on treatement for cadida
UTI. Would not treat unless patient symptomatic or UCx has
higher counts of VRE or growing out a new organism.
.
