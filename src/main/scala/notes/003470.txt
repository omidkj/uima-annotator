Chief Complaint:
DKA.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18741**] is a 55 year-old woman with DMI, severe
gastroparesis, HTN, Grave's Disease and Hepatitis C who
presented to the ED [**9-30**] with hyperglycemia.  She has had
multiple admissions to [**Hospital1 18**] for DKA, most recently discharged
[**2134-8-11**].  She initially c/o fevers, dysuria, thirst, and
nausea and [**Year (4 digits) **]. PTA her blood glucose readings were
300-600. She had no cough or sputum production. She did have one
episode of diarrhea. She also is bothered by chronic lower leg
and back pain, both of which also prompted her ED presentation.
She reports some mild abdominal pain which is typical for her
when she has DKA. She reports she has been compliant with taking
her Lantus and sliding scale.

In the ED, her initial vital signs were: temperature of 98.8,
blood pressure of 124/65, heart rate of 95, respiratory rate of
20, and oxygen saturation of 98% on RA. A finger stick glucose
was critically high at triage. The ED team had a difficult time
obtaining access, so a right femoral central line was placed.
She was started on an insulin drip at 7 units per hour and she
was started on intravenous fluids, on her first liter at time of
transfer.

In the ICU she was transitioned off the insulin gtt, back to
bolus insulin [**10-1**]. She was given 6L IVF. Her nausea improved.
She had no clear infctious etiology, with clear urine, so was
given 1 dose of cipro but this was stopped. She was thought to
have a viral syndrome as etiology of her DKA.

Currently she feels generally unwell, with global achiness, but
overall improved from admission. She continues to have dysuria
despite negative UA/CX. She has a dry cough but no shortness of
breath. She c/o bilateral lower back pain, which is not normal
for her and started prior to admission. She has not been out of
bed since admission.

ROS: 10 point review of systems negative except as noted above.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus with many
admissions for DKA, who presented with DKA.

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis, type I DM with complications: Patient
has history of many admissions for DKA.  It is not entirely
clear what prompted this episode, likely viral syndrome as no
evidence of UTI, pulmonary infection, no evidence of cardiac
ischemia.  Patient improved with IV fluids, and insulin. Pt
initially received insulin drip, converted to SQ insulin, with
fair control.  At time of discharge, glucose 100-259; but
generally in mid to high 100's.  Pt was returned to her home
insulin regimen, and will follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] the day
following discharge.

2. Global achiness: suspect viral syndrome as no clear evidence
of other infection.  Pt also with some localization to
sacroiliac joints bilaterally. Pt was briefly given tramadol to
treat pain, but this was not continued at discharge.
