Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5880**]
Chief Complaint:
Massive recurrent ventral hernia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Component separation muscle flap.
2. Reconstruction of abdominal wall with mesh placement.


History of Present Illness:
HISTORY/INDICATIONS: The patient had a colectomy in the past
with severe abdominal wall infection, treated with an open
abdomen. She presented with a large ventral hernia which she
wished to have repaired. She was seen by Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] who
agreed that component separation would be a good approach.


Past Medical History:
Past medical history is diabetes type 2 diabetes on Humulin
insulin 50 units in the morning and 40 units in the evening. She
also has hypertension on cardiogram. H/o colon cancer, Left
hemicolectomy c/b MRSA infection, obesity.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on the day of surgery ([**2162-2-8**]). The
procedure itself was sucessful, and uncomplicated, and there was
minimal blood loss. Please refer to OMR reports for operative
details. The patient tolerated the procedure well, however due
to the replacement of the abdominal contents back into the
abdominal cavity, the anesthesiologist was not able to extubate
at the end of the procedure safely and the patient was therefore
taken intubated but in otherwise stable condition to the ICU.
POD1 she was febrile to 102.4, her urine output decreased and
she became hypotensive. She responded to fluid boluses and
levophed. EKG did not demonstrate any acute changes. Fever
work-up did not point to a clear source however she was started
on vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl. Her respiratory status
continued to necessitate the ventilator, and she began to
demonstrate mild CHF as well. Bladder pressure was checked due
to concern for possible abdominal compartment syndrome, however
it was normal and the respiratory failure was felt to be
primarily to the return of abdominal contents into the andominal
cavity in the OR. CT chest/abdomen was obtained on POD2 and was
negative for bowel herniation or other intra-abdominal process
as well as PE. Antibiotics were continued given fever and
elevated wbc (17.5 from 15ish post-surgery) and she remained
stable on pressors and vent. POD3 she was still intermittently
febrile, however she had begun to mobilize fluids and her urine
output picked up. We were also able to begin weaning pressors
and peep and it appeared she might be turning the corner,
however she had been enrolled in the esophageal balloon study
early in the course of her care and study prevented weaning her
vent settings as much or as fast as we otherwise would have. She
received a unit of PRBCs on POD4 for hct of 22.8, pressors were
weaned off, and she also extubated successfully once she was no
longer in the study and her vent settings could be weaned. Her
wbc decreased to normal, she remained afebrile and her cultures
returned negative and on POD5 her abx were discontinued. She
continued to progress clinically, was started on clears and
slowly her diet was advanced. She was transferred to the floor
on POD6 and was started on a full diet the following day. She
was working well with physical therapy and continued to steadily
become stronger over the next several days. Her JP drain
remained in place per plastics given the output was greater than
30cc/day. She is being discharged home on POD10 afebrile,
ambulating well, tolerating a full diet, wound healing nicely.
She is encouraged to wear her abdominal binder as often as
possible and record the daily output of the JP drain. She has
close follow-up as outlined below with both plastics and general
surgery.
