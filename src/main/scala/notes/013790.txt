History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 111034**] is a 68 year-old man with a history of hepatitis
C/ cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma s/p cadaveric liver
transplant in [**1-/2118**], also with a history of CAD s/p RCA and LAD
stenting in [**1-/2118**], HTN, GERD, DM type 2, dementia. He was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (3) 111043**] for fever and hypoxia
felt [**1-31**] RLL pneumonia, and treated with Flagyl, Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin empirically, and then was re-admitted from
[**Date range (3) 101313**] for multiresistant Klebsiella RLL PNA treated
with 2 weeks imipenem.
.
However, several days after finishing imipenem ([**2120-1-25**]), he
again developed fever and respiratory distress. He was admitted
to [**Hospital3 1443**] Hosp on [**2-8**] and intubated for respiratory
distress (suctioning revealed food-like substance). At this time
he was noted to have an Na 146, K 5.6, BUN/Cr 73/2.2, BG 500,
Trop .16, WBC 16 with 4% bandemia, Hct 33. CXR from [**2-9**] showed
RLL PNA. He was negative for influenza, and bcx were negative.
[**2-9**] sputum showed many yeast and GNR, with rare GPR. FK506 was
7 from [**2-9**]. The patient was treated with imipenem and diflucan
for possible recurrent klebsiella and fungal PNA. He was also
treated for flagyl for possible C. diff colitis given his
chronic diarrhea (diarrhea on his previous [**Hospital1 18**] admission was
C. diff negative).
.
He was extubated transiently but required reintubation on [**2-11**]
for respiratory distress. CXR from [**2-12**] showed R effusion and
bilateral infiltrates. On [**2-10**], LENI showed R DVT but IV heparin
had to be stopped [**2-12**] due to acute hct drop from 28 to 24 with
guaiac + stools. He received 1U pRBC prior to transfer to the
[**Hospital1 18**]. Cr was noted to have decreased to 1.1.
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], vitals were: 96.9  153/68  96, intubated.
He had 2+ pitting edema, and was tremulous with flapping noted.
Repeat LENI's confirmed R DVT (R common femoral through
popliteal fossa). Head CT to evaluate MS was negative. Hct was
noted to decrease from 27 to 25; NG lavage was negative and pt
was guiac negative. The patient was continued on heparin gtt.
Diflucan was d/c'ed but imipenem and flagyl were continued. Hct
dropped again on [**2-14**] and pt rec'd another unit pRBC. Pt was
extubated successfully on [**2120-2-16**]. Prograf was held
(supratherapeutic), then restarted on [**2-18**]. Nadolol was titrated
up as pt was hypertension. On [**2-15**] a family meeting was held and
the pt was made DNR/DNI. Coumadin was started on [**2120-2-18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68 yo man with MMP s/p liver transplant here with recurrent
fever and respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration PNA and
possible multi-resistant klebsiella.
.
1. PNA: Recurrent aspiration PNA, in setting of decreased MS.
S/p extubation, stable.
- The patient continued a 14 day course of imipenem. He was kept
NPO, fed only by TF's. The pt's PNA was observed by CXR to
decrease over time. He remained afebrile, normal WBC's, and did
not require supplimental oxygen.
.
2. S/p GIB: The pt's hct stable. There was no role for EGD at
this time, per the liver team. He was transfused for hct < 28,
given CAD. Lansoprazole was continued [**Hospital1 **].
.
3. DVT: The patient was begun on a heparin drip as a bridge to
coumadin. INR goal is [**2-1**]. INr on day of discharge was 1.5;
spoke to attending about this who wished to maintain pt on
coumadin 5 mg qd and check INR qd until theraptuic and adjust
coumadin dose as needed.
.
4. ARF: Resolved completely. The patient had likely been
prerenal in the setting of infection.
.
5. S/p liver transplant.
- The patient was restarted on tacrolimus, continued at 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
Levels were checked q3d, with a goal of [**5-4**] (held for > 7).
Tacrolimus continued at current dose and another FK506 level
should be checked on Thursday [**2120-2-29**]. Results or
questions can be directed to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10924**] at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
6. HTN - The patient's nadolol was increased to a maximum of
80mg qd. At this time lisinopril was begun and titrated up to
blood pressure control. BP should be checked every few days and
lisinopril can be increased or an additional [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such as CCB
or diuretic can be added if needed.
.
7. FEN - TF's. The patient was fed by NGT while discussion was
had with the patient's family regarding a more permanent feeding
tube. On [**2-23**], a PEJ tube was placed and TF's were begun 1 day
later and goal TF's was reached with probalance formula.
.
8. Volume status - The patient was noted to be increasingly
volume overloaded after his transfer from the MICU. He was given
40mg IV lasix, to which he diuresed over 2L, and remained
euvolemic by physical exam afterwards.
.
9. Acute altered mental status, on top of dementia. Per records,
the pt's dementia had its onset after the pt's liver transplant
in 2/[**2117**]. The etiology was unclear, and a full w/u was done by
neurology without reversible cause shown. On this admission, the
pt's mental status was noted to improve as his infection
resolved. At baseline, he intermittently responds to questioning
with appropriate few-word answers, clearly articulated. On this
admission he had initially been placed on lactulose for possible
hepatic encephalopathy-related AMS, but this was unsuccessful.
.
10. Diarrhea - The patient had a chronic, C diff negative,
diarrhea. He was started on lactulose on this admission for
possible hepatic encephalopathy contributing to altered MS, and
he began producing some formed stools as well as diarrhea, when
the lactulose was d/c'ed. His continuing diarrhea was attributed
most likely to his TF's.
.
11. DM - Continued RISS q6h and NPH 20 [**Hospital1 **].
.
10. Wound care: Duoderm dsg to coccyx q3d, R hip/ L heel duoderm
q3d, R heel w to dry [**Hospital1 **]. On discharge, wound care nurse
reccomended several new dressing solutions including accuzyme to
sacrum.
.
11. Access: Double lumen PICC placed on [**2-22**] for heparin and
antibiotics. PICC d/c'd on discharge.
.
12. Code: DNR/DNI
.
13. Dispo: To NH, pending therapeutic INR and TF's at goal.
.
