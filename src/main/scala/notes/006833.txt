History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23638**] is a 76 year old female with DM, HTN, CAD, PVD who
was discharged today from neurology following a hospitalization
for a large L MCA infarct. Of note, patient received IV, IA tpA
(penumbra device) [**10-20**] for this infarct. Within 30 minutes of
patient's arrival to rehab today (16:30), the patient was noted
to be pale, minimally responsive and then started vomiting
blood.

ED course: In ED at [**Hospital1 18**] initial vitals: temp 104.2 hr 86 bp
203/79 rr 20 O2 sat 98% on non rebreather. Hypertension rapidly
resolved and was attributed to the patient's acute distress.
Lung clear, tachycardic on exam, hypoactive bowel sounds, frank
bright red blood from rectum with an apparent mass, and vomiting
blood. Mouth 150 ml of blood. Patient was intubated for airway
protection. NG tube was placed with 200 ml of blood returned. In
setting of propofol, for intubation patient became
hemodynamically unstable with SBPs into 80s for less than 10
minutes. Patient recovered blood pressure with cessation of
propofol. Patient sedated with fentanyl and versed for sedation.


CT head no interval change. CT Torso bilateral bronchopneumonia
consistent with either pneumonia or pneumonitis from aspirating
blood. Patient received vancomycin and zosyn for presumed
hospital acquired pneumonia.

Patient had G-tube placement yesterday due to dyphagea from
recent stroke. CT torso on admission did not indicate
complication from G-tube placement, but did show impacted stool.


EKG: sinus, NEW [**Street Address(2) 1766**] depressions in V3-V6 and TWI II, III and
aVF. Enzymes are pending.

Patient received vitamin K for presumed coagulopathy, zofran for
vomiting, tylenol for fever, and protonix 40 mg.

Neurology were consulted. Per Neurology's report "She was an in
patient in [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 11, and before she left for [**Hospital1 1319**], no
bleeding was noted, her vitals had been stable, she had no
residuals from her tube feeds, and she had normal bowel sounds."
On exam in ED neurology notes the patient had no new
neurological deficits.

GI was also consulted. Repeat NG lavage by GI prior to MICU
transfer was negative. Most recent vitals from ED: HR 89, BP
140/88, 100% RA, RR 16 with vent at CMV Tv 500, rate 14.

On arrival to MICU, patient was noted to be intubated, sedated
with no active bleeding from her mouth or NG tube. Patient also
has no active rectal bleeding.

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2186-11-5**]): Sinus rhythm at a rate of 92. Normal axis. 1-2mm

prior study dated [**2186-11-4**] and new from study dated [**2186-10-27**].

Imaging:
CT Torso ([**2186-11-4**]): 1. Peribronchovascular right upper lobe
opacities concerning for infection, aspiration, or possibly
pulmonary hemorrhage. 2. Bibasilar pulmonary consolidation
likely atelectasis +/- aspiration. 3. Gastrostomy tube in place
with large amount of subcutaneous gas along the entry site in
the intra-abdominal wall and gas in the left rectus sheath.
Findings may reflect postoperative changes though clinical
correlation is advised. 4. Marked fecal impaction of the rectum.
Clinical correlation is advised. Given the clinical history of
rectal bleeding, the possibility of superimposed
hemorrhoids cannot be excluded. 5. Diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis. 6. Bilateral renal cortical
irregularity which may reflect chronic infarctions. Given
atherosclerotic changes at the level of the renal artery
origins, the possibility of renal artery stenosis cannot be
excluded. Recommend clinical correlation. 7. Cardiomegaly with
atherosclerotic changes of the coronary arteries.
.
Head CT, noncontrast ([**2186-11-4**]): 1. No evidence of new
hemorrhage. Continued evolution of left putamen and globus
pallidus, hemorrhage, and edema. Continued evolution of left
middle cerebral artery territory infarct. 2. No shift of
normally midline structures.
.
CXR ([**2186-11-5**]): Right subclavian catheter has been placed. The
tip terminates in the superior vena cava. Nasogastric tube
courses below the diaphragm, but the tip is not seen. Heart is
mildly enlarged. Again noted is a small left pleural effusion
with left lower lobe atelectasis. The remainder of the lungs are
clear.
.
RUE U/S ([**2186-11-8**]): No DVT.
.
Portable abdominal X-Ray ([**2186-11-9**]): A J-tube is seen in place,
unchanged
from scout images taken on [**2186-11-4**]. Also seen is a
nasogastric tube in good position projecting over the stomach.
The bowel gas pattern is nonspecific and there is no free air or
pneumatosis. Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic
spine.
.
Perc G-J tube check ([**2186-11-10**]): Prelim report, replacement of
the existing 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 9835**] GJ catheter for a 16 French
gastric-jejunal feeding catheter with the jejunal port ready to
use for feeding.
.
Renal ultrasound ([**2186-11-13**]): Asymmetric kidneys which is noted
on the ultrasound of [**2183-12-7**] otherwise unremarkable renal
ultrasound with no hydronephrosis seen.
.
U/S GJ-tube site ([**2186-11-15**]): No abscess.
