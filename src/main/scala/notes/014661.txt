Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 106420**] was a same day admit after undergoing
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**3-1**] she was brought
to the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x 3.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Cefazolin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication.  She does have a
history of atrial fibrillation.  She is maintained on aspirin
and plavix without coumadin.  This plan is confirmed with Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) 437**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name 679**].  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
