History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 yo woman with PAF, stroke in past, high chol, cad,
as well as dementia and hx breast ca past s/p L mastectomy, who
presents from [**Hospital3 **] facility as "code stroke" when
friends noticed she was not talking around 12:30PM.  Initially,
unable to identify last well time - spoke with [**Doctor First Name 2110**] (SW in
facility) who saw her at 1PM and said that pt's friends reported
that pt could not talk and was drooling between 12:30 and 1PM -
she had apparently showed up to lunch that way.  She was seen
well at dinner night prior; when staff went to room today, there
was another shirt "with drool on it" thus staff thinks drooling
may have started earlier in day.  Was apparently able to walk
normally with no signs of weakness anywhere.  Pt brought to
[**Hospital1 18**]
ED where NIHSS score was 9 for LOC questions, Visual field cut
(L
SIDE), Sensory neglect (R SIDE), aphasia (could comprehend
commands and y/n questions but nearly no output), and likely
decreased sensation on R.  As code stroke called at 2PM and last
well was unknown, she was considered out of window for IV and IA
TPA.  Eventually met another staff member who gave her meds at
8:30AM and says that pt was completely at baseline at time - at
this point, because she was in 9hr window, she was considered
for
[**Last Name (un) **] protocol.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD, recent anterior MI- LAD 30% proximal stenosis with
diffuse severe disease, large DI with 70% occlusion. RCA 70% mid
occlusion.
2) CHF- diastolic dysfunction dx 3 yrs ago
3) History of atrial fibrillation- Previously on coumadin for
many years, but self d/c'd.
4) CVA- age 30's, sensory loss in 1 hand
5) dementia- progressing in past 3 years per daughter
6) breast CA s/p mastectomy

Family History:
noncontributory


Physical Exam:
T 97.4  HR 81  BP 187/47 (last checked: 156 systolic); 98%RA; RR
14
General appearance: elderly white female, NAD, some drooling
HEENT: moist mucus membranes, clear oropharynx
Neck: supple, no bruits, no jvd
Heart: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs
Lungs: crackles at bases bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender +bs
Extremities: warm, well-perfused
.
Mental Status: The patient is alert and awake, seemed to
comprehend commands and questions (answered with head nods, or
showing number of fingers); however, she could not produce
spontaneous speech besides quite dysarthric "Ahh laa" for
"[**Known firstname **]" when asked her name.  When asked to repeat initially,
she was unable to say anything; later, she could repeat slowly
and with significant dysarthria "My Name Is [**Known firstname **]" and said
"Today Sunny Day" for "today is a sunny day."  She could not
name or read, but could sign her name.
.
Cranial Nerves: The visual fields are significant for a left
sided field cut with or without hemineglect. The optic discs are
difficult to visualize (bilateral cataract). Eye movements are
normal, with no nystagmus.  Pupils react equally to light, both
directly and consensually. Sensation on the face is intact to
light touch, pin prick; could not assess ext to DSS on face.
Facial movements are normal and symmetrical. Hearing is intact
to finger rub. The palate elevates in the midline. The tongue
protrudes in the midline and is of normal appearance.
.
Motor System: With the exception of subtle triceps weakness
bilat, and elevated tone in the legs, the appearance, tone,
power are normal in all 4 limbs, including shoulder abductors,
and extensors and flexors of the arms, wrists, fingers, hips,
knees, feet and toes.  There is no tremor, drift, or abnormal
movements.
.
Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are present, symmetric and normal.
The plantar reflexes are mute bilaterally.
.
Sensory: Pt agrees with "normal sensation" on limbs to LT, PP,
but there is extinction to DSS over the right hemi-body.  Could
not fully participate with ?proprioception testing.
.
Coordination: There is no ataxia. The finger/nose test and
finger tapping were normal.
.
Gait:  could not be assessed

.
MRI/MRA: Small right middle and posterior cerebral artery
territory acute infarctions. Given the multivessel distribution
and the history of prior left cerebral hemispheric infarct, the
findings are most consistent with an embolic event.MRA CIRCLE OF
[**Location (un) **]: The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are
patent. Irregularity along the intracranial portions of
bilateral carotid arteries is consistent with moderate
atherosclerosis.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of significant stenosis.
Atherosclerosis.
ADDENDUM: Perfusion images confirm reduced flow in the areas of
acute infarction, somewhat more extensive than the areas of
restricted diffusion. The diffusion/perfusion mismatch is
consistent with the presence of an "ischemic penumbra."
.
Carotid US: There is no appreciable plaque or wall thickening
involving either carotid system. The peak systolic velocities
bilaterally are normal as are the ICA to CCA ratios. There is
normal antegrade flow involving both vertebral arteries.
.
CTA Chest [**1-14**]: . No evidence of pulmonary embolism
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Right upper lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
4. Compressive right and left lower lobe atelectasis.
5. Cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic disease, and a small
pericardial effusion.
.
CTA Chest [**1-24**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Persistent large bilateral pleural effusions.
3.  New left upper lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia
versus
aspiration.
4.  Compressive bibasilar atelectasis.  Improved aeration of the
right upper lobe.
5.  Cardiomegaly, atherosclerotic disease and small pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Floor and ICU Course:
Neuro:  Patient was diagnosed with new right temporal lobe
infarct, suspected to be embolic based on the patient's history
of Afib without being anticoagulated.   Patient was initially
considered for [**Last Name (un) **] study as she was not a candidate for TPA
based on her time window of greater than 3 hrs.  However, the
patient was turned down by the [**Last Name (un) **] study center based on her
troponin leak.  Was managed with supportive care, and started
immediately on Heparin Drip, as well as [**Last Name (un) **] for the developing
MI.  Sustained profound bulbar weakness thought to be as a
result of her bilateral cortical infarcts, vs involvement of
some corticobulbar fibers.  On repeat speech and swallow eval
continued to be unable to swallow [**3-12**] bulbar weakness so PEG
placed.
.
CVS:  Patient was seen Day 1 by cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7965**].  MI
(peaked [**12-14**], and again on [**12-15**] to 0.85).  Beta Blocker and ACE
inhibitor started per cards recs.  Also started on Aspirin.
Developed some degree of CHF with pneumonia on [**1-14**] and was
found to have EF down from 55% to 35 % also with worsening MR.
Initially received Lasix drip to diurese, then Lasix IV BID.
.
Resp: Aspirated [**1-14**] AM.  Intubated emergently and transferred
to ICU.  Extubated [**1-18**] without incident.  RUL PNA and possible
LLL PNA on CXR.  Bilateral effusions  found on CT which were
shrinking after Lasix drip for 72 hrs. Cultures grew
oropharyngeal flora.  Completed 7 day course. Cipro/Flagyl.
Continued to have respiratory distress on the floor which was
felt to be [**3-12**] pleural effusions and pneumonia.
.
GI:  on TF and protonix. h/o GI bleed with recent guiac +
([**1-17**]), melanotic stools and Hct trending down over weekend
([**2166-1-16**]).  Seen by GI
