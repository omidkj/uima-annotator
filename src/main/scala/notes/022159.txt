Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76 yo M with hx of CAD (s/p CABG), Dementia, CHF, MRSA UTI
presents from OSH with fever, lethargy, increased WBC and
hypotension. He was febrile at NH to 102.9, diagnosed with a UTI
and pneumonia. It appears he was started on ceftriaxone,
ceftazidime and levaquin. Pt recently admitted to OSH on
[**11-6**] for similar sx which resolved with IVF and abx (CTX,
Vanc, Flagyl). Pt then decompensated today with either
aspiration event or UTI and had increased HR and hypotension, O2
sat stable. Found to have R renal mass on CT with necrosis and
bleeding at OSH. This was initially found at recent admission to
[**Hospital1 **] where he had hematuria. It appears embolization was
considered but deferred given the hematuria and felt he would
not tolerate procedure. In the ED his vitals were T 98.9, HR 99,
BP 80's/40's, 100%2L. WBC 17, HCT 23 (bl 25-27), Na 150, Creat
1.7, lact 1.8, u/a >50 WBC. He was given fluid boluses (up to
4L) and BP did not improve. He was also given diltiazem 10 IVx2
for HR 120s with no response, vancomycin and zosyn and flagyl.
.
His BP dropped to SBP 60s and was started on levophed via his
PICC. He was transfused one unit of PRBC. He is DNR/DNI and
family did not want aggressive measures including CVL placement.
They do want pressors.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was in a. flutter to 150, BP 103/61 on
levophed. He converted to SR within a few minutes, BP stable
100/58.

.
CT OF ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:
There are bilateral moderate pleural effusions and associated
dependent atelectasis of lung bases.
There is a 7 x 7 cm mass arising from the lower pole of the
right kidney that has a necrotic mass within it. This mass is
enhancing peripherally and is associated with few
retroperitoneal collaterals. There are multiple large necrotic
lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum near right renal vain
measuring up to 23 x23 mm. There is one right renal artery for
each kidney. Right renal vein has heterogenous appearance and
cannot be well assesed due to phase of the study. The left
kidney, left adrenal gland, right adrenal gland, liver,
pancreas, the loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable.
The gall bladder is enlarged. No free air or f luid is seen
within the abdomen.
.
CT OF PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:
The rectum, sigmoid colon, urinary bladder, distal ureters are
unremarkable. The prostate gland has areas of calcification
within it and looks enlarged.
No free air or free fluid is seen within the pelvic cavity.
No pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic lymph node is
detected.
.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen.
Again noted is severe degenerative changes of thoracic and
lumbar spine.
.
TTE: IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, consistent with CAD. Severe mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG, dememtia, CHF who presents with
sepsis.  Patient has been made CMO (please see below).
.
# Sepsis/Infection: Likely due to pneumonia and a UTI.  He
initially required pressors for support and was covered
empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics.  He was also
started on stress dosed steroids for a poor response to cortrysn
stimulation.  He was switched to zosyn and then to ceftaz/flagyl
when he needed a lower sodium load.  He received more than 7
days antibiotics.  For his urinary tract infection (vancomycin
resistant enterococcus), his chronic indwelling foley (present x
approximately one month prior to admission; he is s/p curative
laser treatment for his history of obstructive BPH) was
discontinued and he was treated with linezolid.  He is urinating
well, independently of his foley with a stable creatinine.
Bladder scans were non [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 65**] residuals.  The patient does have a
flailed urethra making him urinate all over and he will need
frequent cleanings to keep the skin dry and intact.  The patient
continued to have an elevated WBC of unclear etiology.  His
sacral decub wound grew [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he will finish 4 more days
linezolid for 14 days total.  He was c diff negative for
multiple samples.  After discussion with the family, further
investigation was discontinued with goals changed to comfort
(see below).
.
# CHF: ECHO showed EF 45% with severe MR resulting in moderate
pulmonary hypertension.  Patient was started on an ACEI and seen
by cardiology who said to titrate this up as tolerated.
.
# Anemia:  Labs suggest anemia of chronic disease but given
guaic positive stools and history of hematuria, also concerned
for possible acute blood loss.  Folate/B12 were normal.  Patient
received 1 more unit PRBCs after transfer to the floor.  At this
time family would not want further blood draws.  On day of
discharge patient had another large BM, darker, with heme +
stool.  Should be monitored.
.
# Dementia: Per his daughter, he was at his baseline mental
status upon discharge from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  He has advanced dementia
and was continued on aricept and namenda.
.
# CAD: His ASA was held given guaic positive stool and history
of hematuria.  He was not on a statin on admission and his lipid
profile is normal.  His beta blocker was added back once his BPs
stabilized.
.
# Hypernatremia:  Sodium elevated to low 150s following 7+L NS
fluid resuscitation.  He received D5W and free water boluses via
G-tube and eventually the Na returned to [**Location 213**] ranges.
.
# ARF:  Creatinine on admission was elevated to 1.7 in the
setting of dehydration and poor perfusion in setting of sepsis.
Creatinine improved with treatment of sepsis and IVFs.
.
# Afib w/ RVR: Pt. was in and out of a. fib and a. flutter
during his stay.  He did drop his BP to 70s systolics during one
episode of a. flutter w/ rates of 150s while in the ICU, but
otherwise remained HD stable.  His lopressor was restarted.
Despite his age and h/o CHF, he is a poor candidate for
anticoagulation and has had bleeding from right sided necrotic
renal mass.
.
# Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage 3.  Wound care RN was consulted
and recommended allevyn dressing.  He remained on a kinair bed
and was rotated q3 hours.
.
# Renal mass: Seen on imaging at OSH with ?renal cell. He had
hct drop at OSH without clear source so there was some question
as to whether he had bled into this necrotic mass.  Repeat scan
here again revealed enlarged necrotic mass on R side with
necrotic lymph nodes.  Patient also continued to have
intermittent hematuria with some clots, believed to be from
kidney mass.  Reviewed with family who are aware of the
suspicion or renal cell CA and do not want further work up (ie
surgery).
.
# FEN: Has PEG and tube feeds were continued.  Free water
flushes were started in the setting of his free water deficit
and hypernatremia and should be continued.
.
