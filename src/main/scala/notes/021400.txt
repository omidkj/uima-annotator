Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Facial Swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 41yo female with PMHx of type 1 DM (last HGbA1c 7.9
[**8-14**]), PVD (s/p bilateral [**Month/Year (2) 6024**]) with non-healing stump wound
infection, recurrent UTIs (with neurogenic bladder), who
presents with a left ear pain.

She endorses worsening pain and swelling of skin surrounding the
ear, but denies any other ear pain. She denies any drainage, and
denies any fevers or chills at home. She says taht the pain
started last weekend, and had started out as a pmiple on her
ear. She also denies any toothaches. She has never had an
infection like this before on her skin. She does endorse an
ongoing bedsore on L ischium. A CT non-contrast was performed
which preliminarily is read as concerning for cellulitis along
the left auricle root, extending superiorly, although early
malignancy otitis externa is certainly of high concern. She also
had a positive U/A, although she does have a neurogenic bladder.

.
In the ED, initial VS were 99.2 78 101/61 16 100%. An inital
hemolyzed blood specimen was highly abnormal, with WBC 19.1, HCT
25.1, Plt 599. She was given 1 L NS, with another 1 L NS with
150 mEq bicarbonate hanging on transfer. She also recieved
Vanomcyin, Zosyn in the ED, in addition to Lorazepam 1mg. For
her hyperkalemia she recieved Calcium gluconate, Dextrose, and
10 U human insulin. She also received 30 g Kayakelate. A renal
consult was obtained, and they recommended a renal U/S, Foley
placement. She urinated 600 cc after 1 L NS.
.
Vitals on transfer were 116 104/75 16 100% RA. Access was an
issue, and she only had a 22 G in her L arm placed.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is AAOx3, and responsive to
questioning. She is in no acute distress, and feels her pain has
improved greatly since starting antiobitics.

Pertinent Results:
[**4-12**] Renal U/S:
IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.
.
[**4-12**] CXR:
There is no evident pneumothorax. There are low lung volumes.
Right upper
lobe atelectasis is new. Otherwise the lungs are clear. Cardiac
size is top normal. There is no pleural effusion.
.
[**4-11**] CT head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue induration at the base of the left auricle
extending
superiorly along the scalp, raising concern for early malignant
otitis
externa. No osseous erosions.
2. No acute intracranial process.
3. Marked calcifications of the cavernous carotid and vertebral
arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 41yo female with PMHx of poorly controlled DMI
(last HbA1c 7.9 [**8-14**]) complicated by PVD (s/p bilateral [**Month/Year (2) 6024**])
with non-healing stump wound infection, neurogenic bladder with
recurrent UTIs who initially presented to ED with left ear pain,
transferred to the MICU because of presumptive diagnosis of
malignant otitis externa, course complicated by ATN/ARF,
hypotension and rapid drop in hct with unstable blood volume.
.
#. Sepsis: On presentation patient admitted to MICU for sepsis.
Several potential sources of infection, but did not appear to
have signs of shock. UA dirty though urine culture with fecal
contamination, history of pan-resistant Klebsiella urine
infections (sensitive only to Tetracyclie). She denied any
urinary or respiratory complaints though she has neurogenic
bladder and straight caths herself. Her CXR appear
