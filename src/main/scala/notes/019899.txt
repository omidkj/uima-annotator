PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 6 mg alternating with

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 98.9, heart rate was 89, blood
pressure was 130/70, respiratory rate was 15, oxygen
saturation was 96% on room air.  In general, in no acute
distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed
sclerae were anicteric.  Cardiovascular was irregular.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation.  Abdomen was soft, mildly
distended, and nontender.  No masses, and no scars seen.
Rectal was heme-positive with no masses.  Extremities
revealed no edema.  Neurologically, he was grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
on admission revealed his sodium was 143, his potassium
was 4.3, chloride was 101, bicarbonate was 32, blood urea
nitrogen was 28, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose
was 156.  His white blood cell count was 12.3, hematocrit
was 41, platelets were 194.  His bilirubin was 0.7, alkaline
phosphatase was 66, ALT was 25, AST was 19, amylase was 47.
His INR was 2.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:    A CT scan was done which revealed
obstruction at the splenic flexure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted and made nothing
by mouth and started on some antibiotics; namely,
ciprofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was admitted to the Medicine
Service.  It was decided that a colonoscopy should be
performed.  Due to the evaluated INR, several days were
waited prior to doing the colonoscopy due to the risk of
hemorrhage during biopsy.  It was attempted to give the
patient fresh frozen plasma; however, he became anaphylactic.

The patient eventually had a colonoscopy and biopsies taken.
The biopsies revealed adenocarcinoma.  Careful review of the
CT scan showed a low attenuation and lesion in the tail of
the pancreas associated with a splenic flexure mass.

After very extensive discussions with the family, it was
initially decided the patient should not have surgery.
However, the family then wished to have surgery.  A
preoperative stress MIBI was obtained.  The results were an
ejection fraction of 49% with a small inferior reversible
defect.

The patient was brought to the operating room on [**9-22**].
The procedure performed was an exploratory laparotomy with
mobilization of the spleen and colocolotomy.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the floor for
his care.  On postoperative day one, it was noted the patient
was not making adequate amounts of urine.  Despite receiving
multiple fluid boluses, the patient's urine did not respond.
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, and a
Swan-Ganz catheter was placed.  Based upon his numbers, the
patient was started on dopamine at high doses.  The patient
began to make urine.  The creatinine value for the patient
also increased from a baseline of 0.8 to a value of 1.8 on
postoperative day one, and eventually to a value of 3.

The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit intubated and
on dopamine.  Eventually, the dopamine was weaned, and the
patient was started on Levophed.

On postoperative day two, a troponin value was obtained which
was 19.  A Cardiology consultation was obtained, and it was
decided catheterization would not be performed at that time.

On the night of [**9-27**], the patient had an episode of
emesis with a high suspicion for aspiration.  The patient's
oxygenation significantly worsened.

An extensive discussion was started with the family on
[**9-27**] and continued into [**9-28**].  It was decided on
[**9-28**], that support should be withdrawn.  The patient
expired in the afternoon of [**9-28**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post colocolotomy.
2.  Transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
[**Unit Number **].  Death.
