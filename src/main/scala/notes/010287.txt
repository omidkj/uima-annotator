History of Present Illness:
 46 year old man with DM2, HTN, HLD and morbid obesity with
recurrent foot infections who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
with fever, chills and left foot pain on [**2122-5-28**].  He was found
to have left foot ulcer suggestive of osteomyelitis and possible
abscess formation.  X-ray did suggest acute osteomyelitis.  ESR
14 and CRP 68.  Podiatry saw him and suggested IV antibiotics.
Unfortunately the patient refused MRI and bone scan was not
pursued.  He also developed nausea and vomitting on [**2122-5-29**] from
unclear etiology.  PPI was started, no documentation of whether
emesis was bloody, but HCT dropped from 26 -> 21.  Additionally,
oxygen saturations dropped to 89-93% on RA, thought to be
positional and/or sleep apnea.  CXR on [**2122-5-29**] showed RLL
atelectasis, but no evidence of consolidation.  He was
hemodynamically stable.  Due to poor IV access, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PICC placement.  However, during
transport to our hospital he vomited and became subsequently
dyspneic and hypoxic.

Upon arrival the ED, initial vitals were 100.4 100 21 158/52 98%
3L NC. He received a PICC line with confirmed placement in the
SVC.  After the procedure the patient vomitted and then became
more hypoxic, with oxygen saturations in the 60s, HR 140s
(sinus) and was febrile to 102F.  Labs notable for ABG:
7.36/31/45/18, lactate 4.0, HCT 22 and WBC 3.8.  CXR was notable
for multifocal pneumonia, most pronounced in the right lung.  UA
without evidence of infection.  He received albuterol and
ipratropium nebulizers and levofloxacin.  2L NS given.
Saturations improved to 90% on a non-rebreather.  Vitals prior
to transfer: HR 133 RR 22 BP 138 12 Sat 100% NRB.

On arrival to the MICU, he was in respiratory distress,
tachycardic and diaphoretic with sats high 80's to 90% on NRB.
Tried a nebulizer and his sats dropped to 60%.  Started Bipap
with improvement in saturations to 97% on 70% FiO2 Bipap 10/5.
His work of breathing improved, and BP slowly dropped from 180's
to 140s.  HR improved from 140s to 120s, sinus tachycardia.  He
feels short of breath and has a cough.  Asks frequently when he
can eat.  Tells me he was once intubated in the past for
pneumonia.  He first noticed his left foot ulcer 2 days ago and
says that it is not painful.

CXR [**5-30**]: IMPRESSION:  Multifocal pneumonia.  Volume overload is
also possible.

CXR [**5-30**]: IMPRESSION:  Progression of bilateral airspace disease.
 Findings may represent bilateral infection or edema.  Clinical
correlation suggested.

ECHO [**5-31**]: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal images due to body habitus. The
right ventricle is markedly dilated with significant hypokinesis
of the right ventricular free wall. Due to RV dilation, the left
ventricle is compressed. Its function is probably normal. Unable
to estimate pulmonary artery pressures but are likely to be
elevated.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 year old man with DM2, HTN, and morbid obesity who presented
for PICC line placement, but developed respiratory failure after
vomiting and was found to have rapidly progressive multifocal
pneumonia with resultant hypoxia.

He initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for a left foot ulcer and
was started on vancomycin and zosyn for possible osteomyelitis
(although this was not confirmed by imaging).  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2122-5-30**] for PICC placement for the
above antibiotic administration.  During transport he vomited
and was noted to be hypoxic but improved with oxygen
administration in our ED.  He received the PICC line in IR.

After line placement, he vomited again and respiratory status
worsened.  CXR showed progression of pneumonia with marked
bilateral air space opacities.  Oxygen saturations were low 90's
on a non-rebreather, HR rose to 140bpm (sinus tachycardia) and
he was hypertensive.  Upon arrival to the MICU, his work of
breathing increased, with RR 30 bpm.  Bipap was started with
improvement in saturations to 97% on 70% FiO2 and decreased HR
to 11
