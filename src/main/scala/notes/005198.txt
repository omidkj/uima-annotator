Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old man
with multiple medical problems including cirrhosis secondary
to Amiodarone, aortic valve replacement (St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**]), atrial
fibrillation, and pleural effusions who presents with a
general feeling of malaise, weakness and shortness of breath.
The patient has felt "terrible," for the past week though he
can not put his finger on why.  He has noted dyspnea on
exertion for several weeks, worse over the past week.  His
review of systems is also positive for cold and taros
diarrhea.  He denies fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting
and diaphoresis.  He denies chest pain, jaw pain or anginal
equivalent.  He denies abdominal pain with diarrhea which he
describes as dark.  The diarrhea has been persistent over
several months.  Review of systems is also positive for
decreased p.o. intake over the past week but no paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea.  The patient came to the
Emergency Department for further evaluation, found to be
bradycardia in the 30s with INR of 6.2.  Of note, the patient
was recently started on Digoxin in [**Month (only) 958**] for rapid atrial
fibrillation.  With respect to his INR the patient's Coumadin
has been changed recently to 7.5, alternating with 10.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married with five children.
He is a retired machinist.  He has a 40 pack year smoking
history, quit 40 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient's
temperature is 96.4, pulse 62 range 30s to 40s, blood
pressure 152/55, respiratory rate 18, sating 99% on room air.
In general he is a pleasant man in no acute distress.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  Pupils equal, round and reactive to
light and accommodation.  His jugular venous pulse was detected
at 10 cm.
Lungs, decreased breath sounds at the right base to [**1-8**] the
way up, and normal left lung examination.  His heart was
rhythm, bradycardiac and regular with mechanical S2 and II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border.
The abdomen was distended with normoactive bowel sounds.  He
was mildly tender in the right upper quadrant, liver edge was
at the costal margin and dull to percussion around one-third
of the way up.  Extremities had 1+ pitting edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data included white count of 7.8
with a normal differential, hematocrit 30.0 which is his
baseline.  Platelets 132.  Sodium 141, potassium 5.0,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 3, BUN 30, creatinine 1.1, glucose
173.  His calcium was 9.5, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 2.8.
His PTT was 37.3, INR 6.2.  His Digoxin level was 2.9.  AST
40, ALT 29, total bilirubin .6, alkaline phosphatase 142.  He
had a chest film that showed a right pleural effusion that
was associated with right lower lobe collapse.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular - The patient had two
problems as far as cardiovascular examination over the course
of his admission. Tthe first was bradycardia, likely secondary
to medication toxicity, predominantly Digoxin.  The patient
had neural agents on top of the Digoxin and it was likely due
to toxicity that lead to his bradycardia.  The patient had
both his Propranolol, Diltiazem and Digoxin withheld on
admission,
and had a cardiology consult on the second day of admission.
They recommended waiting until the Digoxin level was less
than .9 and then cardioverting.  This was attempted, however,
within several hours the patient went back into atrial
fibrillation, and so he was rate-controlled with medication over
the rest of
his admission.  He was initially just kept on the Propranolol
which was later changed over to Metoprolol.  Later in the
hospital course he developed congestive heart failure.
Unfortunately he
went back into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response, so he was maintained on both Metoprolol and high
levels of Diltiazem with success.
The [**Last Name **] problem was
congestive heart failure, occurring after
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.
Two days following TIPS, the patient developed severe dyspnea and
tachypnea,
yet did not have any clear evidence for hypoxia, requiring
just 2 lpm O2; however, it was felt that he was likely in
right heart failure with a potential of heart component.  He
was initially diuresed with minimal success, and was then
changed to a Nitroglycerin drip and transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He had a Swan-Ganz catheter
placed which showed both left and right heart failure.  At
the time he developed acute renal failure, and so he was not
diuresed for several days.  He was improved symptomatically
and he was transferred back to the floor.  He was stable off
diuretics for several days, however, again went into
pulmonary edema, was again diuresed, this time with more
success.  At the time of dictation, however, he is not
requiring any further diuretics and he is on 2 liters O2.

2.  Hematology - The patient has a supratherapeutic INR that
is likely considered poor absorption from decreased p.o.
intake and diarrhea.  He was given gentle Vitamin K and
started on heparin while he was subtherapeutic towards the
end of his admission.  After multiple procedures, the patient
was restarted on Coumadin with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.

3.  Pleural effusions - The patient had a pleural effusion,
likely hepatic hydrothorax.  Once he was off
Coumadin, he was taken for thoracentesis under ultrasound
guidance.  He had 1.5 liters of transudative taken off.  There
were no complications from this, and
the patient felt better symptomatically.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient over his
admission developed a drop in hematocrit that was likely
secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed.  Gastroenterology
consult was obtained who recommended going to
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The endoscopy showed Grade 3
varices which were worse compared to the previous as well as
portal hypertensive gastropathy.  The decision at this point
was made to consult the liver service, given the
complications of portal hypertension.  The liver service
recommended increasing his diuretics and ultimately a
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure.  The
patient underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt procedure which was initially uncomplicated, as they were
able to effectively reduce his portal pressures.  As
mentioned above the patient developed complications from this
procedure including acute renal failure and congestive heart
failure that were managed initially in the Intensive Care
Unit and then later on the floor. More to the point, however,
the patient also developed encephalopathy within two days of
completing the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
procedure.  While on balance, it was felt the potential
benefit was to reduce the risk of having a lethal variceal
bleed, the family understood that one consequence and
complication of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt procedure was encephalopathy.  Unfortunately, the
patient's encephalopathy did progress, likely multifactorial
towards the end of his admission.  He was treated with
Lactulose around the clock as well as lactulose enemas with
minimal effect.  Ultimately, the patient had an inf
