Respiratory distress

Cervical lymph node biopsy in OR

History of Present Illness:
.
Mr [**Known lastname 66103**] is a 74yo morbidly obese male with hx significant
for HTN, stroke, cor pulmonale [**3-17**] COPD, DM, and stroke,
transfered from OSH with LLE DVT, PE, and lympadenopathy on CT.
.
Course at OSH: In brief, patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 18201**] on [**2157-9-12**], with productive cough, SOB, increased
O2 requirement(2->4L) and treated for a COPD flare with
levaquin, solumedrol IV, and advair. He showed improvement in
his leukocytosis and respiratory status. After a few days,
however, there was a gradual rise in WBC up to 19, and he began
to deteriorate again. His CXR was negative for new infiltrates
and his Ucx was clear, but his blood grew MRSA and he was placed
on IV vancomycin. He showed an elevated d-dimer, and was
subsequently found to have R popliteal DVT on LE Dopplers. His
respiratory status continued to worsen, but his VQ scan showed
low probability for pulmonary embolism. Given patient's obesity
and immobility, he was placed on lovenox and warfarin. His Chest
CT at the time demonstrated extensive LAD in his cervical and
supraclavicular nodes bilaterally with extension down into the
anterior mediastium and to the level of the AP window. Previous
CT on [**2157-6-27**], had in fact commented on chest mass/infiltrate.
Significant LAD was not noted in the abdomen, and the liver and
spleen to be uninvolved. Because of the rapid progression of the
LAD, patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further evaluation,
tissue biopsy, and treatment.
.
On presentation to the Medicine Service at [**Hospital1 **], patient
complains of having pain and discomfort in his shoulder and neck
for many months. He describes feeling so weak at one point that
he was unable to remain standing long enough to take a shower.
He believes that his respiratory status has declined and that he
has had trouble breathing for the last few weeks. It became
worse around the time he was diagnosed with a DVT at the OSH
hospital. He denies chest pain with inspiration or pain in his
legs.
.
He denies any recent travel, chills, or sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] denies
CP and palpitations. Patient admits to SOB on lying down. He
admits to abdomenal discomfort, bloating and diarrhea for the
last few weeks, perhaps for months. Denies blood per rectum or
melena. No dysuria, hematuria.  He also denies denies pain in
his leg. He admits to sweats and weight loss >10lbs in last 6 mo
but no fevers. Past exposures include [**Doctor Last Name 360**] [**Location (un) 2452**] when he was
stationed in [**Country 10181**]. His brother died of an aucte leukemea at age
74.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
.
Mr [**Known lastname 66103**] is a 74yo morbidly obese male with hx significant
for HTN, stroke, cor pulmonale [**3-17**] COPD, CRI, DM, and stroke,
transfered from OSH with LLE DVT, PE, and lympadenopathy on CT.

#Enlarged lymph nodes on CT:
Patients clinical presentation was most concerning for lymphoma,
especially given his family history of leukemia and exposure to
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] [**Location (un) 2452**]. The nontender superficial, LAD located in the
cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal areas is typical of
Hodgkin's disease. This orderly, anatomic spread to adjacent
nodes, is most c/w the contigous spread of HD. However,
sensation of abdominal fullness and bone pain, reported as pain
in his back and neck, may be indicative of the nontender diffuse
LAD of NHL. Patient has remained febrile, even during infection
with MRSA per records; however, he has had the other
constitutional or B symptoms of weight loss and sweats. The
rapid progression of his LAD may suggest an aggressive lymphoma
such as mantle cell. However, it appears a past CT in [**6-18**]
commented on the mediastinal infiltrate/mass, which could be
referring to the earlier stage of this condition. If this is HD
lymphoma, this patient clearly has greater than a single LN
region affected, making this [**Hospital1 69333**] stage II or higher. We
need abdomenal and pelvic imaging for further staging. HD
Limited disease has 80% long-term survival, whereas advanced
disease has a considerably less survial time. If this is HD, it
is most beneficial to treat it early. Patient's recent
respiratory decline may be [**3-17**] mediastinal mass obstructing the
airway. SVC syndrome is another complication. It is also
important to rule out infectious causes of enlarged lymph nodes:
CMV, EBV, TB.
-surgery was consulted to identify best surgical procedure for
excisional lymph node biopsy
.
CRI: Patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency. He
currently has a BUN77 and Cr1.9, which is in the range he has
remained in the last week. It is important to realize that renal
involvement with lymphoma is seen in 2 to 14 percent of all
patients, and an elevated serum creatinine is reported in 26 to
56 percent. Patient is euvolemic on exam.

MICU Course:
-Patient was transferred to the MICU for desaturations.  He was
fiberoptically intubated and stabilized on pressors.  Biopsy was
performed in the OR after INR correction with FFP.  Preliminary
pathology results showed poorly-differentiated large cell
carcinoma with focal glandular and focal clear cell features.
After diagnosis was made, it was discussed with the family the
few options for therapy and the generally poor prognosis.  He
