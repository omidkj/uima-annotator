[**2129-10-26**]:  EKG:

Sinus tachycardia. Possible right atrial abnormality. Possible
prior septal myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2129-2-10**] the heart rate is much faster with tall P
waves

[**2129-10-26**]:  Cat scan abdomen and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple pelvic fluid collections/abscesses, measuring up to
7.6 cm, as
above with significant fat stranding in the abdomen and numerous
locules of gas extending anteriorly along the abdomen and into
the patient's multiple ventral hernias, likely secondary to
severe, ruptured, sigmoid
diverticulitis/colitis. Mesenteric free fluid. No pneumatosis or
portal
venous gas seen.
2. Multiple ventral hernias, second lowest of which contains
loops of
nonobstructed small bowel and several locules of gas as well as
small amount of free fluid, microperforation not excluded,
although the gas may be extending from the ruptured sigmoid
colitis. Lowest most ventral hernia
contains foci of gas and hazy fat, incarcerated omental fat not
excluded. No bowel obstruction seen.
3. Wedge-shaped hypodensity in the inferior aspect of the
spleen, additional hypodensities seen more superiorly, new since
the prior study, worrisome for infarcts vs. possibly infection.
Adjacent mild splenic stranding.
4. Status post cholecystectomy. Increased intra- and
extra-hepatic biliary
dilatation, which may relate to post-cholecystectomy state, but
increased
since the prior study. Recommend correlation with LFTs and
consider MRCPas
clinically warranted

[**2129-10-30**]:  Chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION:
Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left
effusion,
improved compared with one day earlier

[**2129-10-30**]:  cat scan of abdomen/pelvis

 IMPRESSION:
1. Cul de sac/left adnexal abscess has decreased in size since
[**2129-10-26**]. No evidence of a new abscess.
2. Persisent free fluid around small bowel loops. No evidence of
large or
small-bowel obstruction.
3. Postsurgical changes as above with open abdomen.
Result given by telephone to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], clinical team member, at
1700 hours
[**2129-10-30**]

[**2129-10-31**]:  IR drainage:

IMPRESSION:
Successful 8 French pigtail catheter placement into persistent
pelvic abscess using left transgluteal approach.

The findings were discussed with covering resident in the
surgical ICU for
placement of post-procedural drain orders

[**2129-11-1**]:  Echo:

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with trivial pulmonic valve
stenosis. There is no pericardial effusion

[**2129-11-1**]: Chest x-ray:

HISTORY: Post-sigmoid colectomy, to assess for change.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-31**], the right IJ
catheter has
been pulled back to about the junction of the jugular vein and
the subclavian.
The right PICC line has been pushed forward, though it is still
not within the hemithorax

There is increasing opacification at the left base consistent
with atelectasis and effusion. Pulmonary vascularity now appear
