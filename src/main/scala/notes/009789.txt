History of Present Illness:
81 yo F with CAD s/p past PCI, CKD, hypertension, recent
diagnosis of heart failure, was discharged from the hospital on
[**2157-3-11**] after a presentation for chest pain. She reports that
she had 7 good days following discharge and then started feeling
poorly on Thursday [**2157-3-17**]. Symptoms began with unsteadiness
and tremulouness. She reports some mild confusion in last week.
Patient also began to notice worsening LE edema as well as
weight gain from 148 pounds at discharge on [**2157-3-11**] to 153
pounds on morning of presentation here. In the two days prior to
admission, the patient developed a right-sided CP,
non-radiating, which she reports was similar to the CP she had
at last presentation. Of note, patient reports a week of
constipation prior to having formed bowel movement two days
prior to presentation as well as loose stool on morning prior to
admission. She notes abdominal distension, some abdominal pain,
loss of appetite, and early satiety. She has had poor PO intake
in the last two weeks, but reports that she has been strictly
adhering to a low sodium diet and has been drinking lots of
water daily.

In the ED, initial vital signs were T 97.5, HR 62, BP 168/60, RR
18, 95% RA. For her CP received nitro SL and morphine and became
chest pain free. First set of cardiac enzymes was negative. CXR
was taken with note of small bilateral pleural effusion, not
significantly changed from CXR at prior admission on [**2157-3-9**].
Was identified as having hyponatremia with serum sodium of 112.
For her hyponatremia, received a 250 mL NS bolus.

Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was comfortable and
chest pain free. Denied confusion, though reported some
increased tremulousness.

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2157-3-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, with slight increase in size of left pleural effusion.
There is associated bibasilar atelectasis.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN [**2157-3-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
2. Incompletely evaluated retrocardiac opacity which may
represent atelectasis or consolidation. Clinical correlation
recommended.

RENAL U.S. [**2157-3-22**]:
FINDINGS: Comparison is made with prior study from [**2155-8-18**]. The
right kidney measures 9.5 cm, the left 10.5 cm. There are simple
cysts on the left, the largest in the interpolar region on the
left measuring 1.8 cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stone, or
mass. Doppler evaluation could not be performed, as the patient
was unable to breath-hold.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis or renal stones. Unable to
evaluate renal arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo F with CAD s/p previous PCI, CKD, hypertension, recent
diagnosis of heart failure, admitted with chest pain, LE edema,
and severe hyponatremia.

1. Hyponatremia:
Sodium at presentation was 112. Likely due to diastolic heart
failure causing inappropriate activation of
renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system complicated by excessive
free water intake by patient at home. As patient was reporting
symtpoms of gait instability, tremor, and confusion at
presentation, she was fluid restricted to 1 liter daily and put
on hypertonic saline at low rate (per nephrology consult recs)
the night following admission. Serum sodium rose to 124 on
morning following hypertonic saline administration and
hypertonic saline was stopped. Tremors and confusion resolved on
morning of [**2157-3-22**]. From this point patient began diuresing
without needing furosemide, so this was held while patient's
sodium began to stabilize. At time of transfer out of the
intensive care unit, the patient was feeling well with serum
sodium up to 130. Renal ultrasound on [**2157-3-22**] revealed no
obvious hydronephrosis or other abnormality; however, RAS could
not be ruled out due to patient inability to hold breath during
testing. Home dose of lasix was restarted 24 hours prior to
discharge, and fluid restriction was changed to 2.5L. Na on
discharge was 136.

2. Oxygen desaturations overnight:
Witnessed in MICU overnight on night of [**2157-3-22**]. Likely sleep
apnea given son[**Name (NI) 7884**] respirations and observed apneic episodes
by nursing.
-Recommend outpatient pulmonary sleep study

2. Constipation / abdominal pain:
Patient presented to ICU with abdominal pain and bloating in
setting of hist
