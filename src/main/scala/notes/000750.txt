HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
male with ankylosing spondylosis, but no prior cardiac
history who presented with a history of worsening and more
frequent shortness of breath, dizziness, and palpitations
both on exertion and at rest.

This started two months ago when climbing up stairs.  On the
day prior to admission, the patient experienced this five to
eight times and was brought to the [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency
Department.  There, his heart rate went from 140 to 250, and
the patient experienced shortness of breath and chest
heaviness.  A total of 30 mg of adenosine was given and had
no affect and 50 mg of diltiazem.  The patient was electively
cardioverted back to a normal sinus rhythm and then received
400 mg of amiodarone and was started on Lopressor 25 mg twice
per day.

An echocardiogram at the outside hospital revealed an
ejection fraction of 20% and global hypokinesis.  The patient
was brought to [**Hospital1 69**], and a
cardiac catheterization was performed.  The catheterization
revealed clean coronary arteries but increased pressures;
including a wedge pressure of 30, and an ejection fraction of
20%, and confirmed global hypokinesis.

That evening the patient had atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response, and was started on amiodarone.  He
spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm.

The following day, the patient was taken for an elective
electrophysiology study and for atrial flutter ablation.  The
ablation was successful, but the patient went into
atrial fibrillation.  Ibutilide was started with an
increase QTc noted on electrocardiogram of greater than 700
milliseconds.  A temporary pacing wires were was left in the
coronary sinus.   In retrospect it was noted that the patient's
QT interval had prolonged significantly even prior to ibutilide,
after only a few doses of amiodarone. Amiodarone and ibutilide
were discontinued, and the patient was transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for monitoring.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history is significant
for)
1.  Ankylosing spondylolysis since the age of 23.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia (which the patient denies).
