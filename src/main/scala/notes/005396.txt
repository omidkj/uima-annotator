Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] is a 65 year-old male with history of recent
hospitalization for bilateral pulmonary emboli, DVTs, and
spontaneous intra-hepatic hematoma requiring massive transfusion
protocal activation sent today from PCP's office after four days
of right lower extremity pain.  Patient found to have ultrasound
evidence of a full length right lower extremtiy DVT.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] was admitted from [**2185-4-23**] - [**2185-5-1**] for left sided
chest pain and was found to have bilateral PEs.  Patient was
initially anticoagulated with heparin, which was transitioned to
lovenox and warfarin.  Patient developed abdominal pain and was
found on CT scan to have an intrahepatic hematoma with
extravasation.  He was taken to IR, but no active extravasation
was discovered and nothing was embolized.  He received 4 units
PRBC with massive transfusion protocol and 1 unit platelets.  He
received additional 2 units of PRBC on day 1 of MICU stay
because of hypotension, which was attributed to hemorrhage.
Transplant surgery was consulted and recommended conservative
management of intrahepatic hematoma.  MICU course was
complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
 As anticoagulation was contra-indicated given bleed, IR placed
IVC filter on [**2185-4-25**].  Patient was discharged on no
anticoagulation.
.
Today patient presented to his primary care doctor's office
complaining of 4 days of right lower extremity pain with
numbness in his leg and loss of sensation in his right foot.
The pain is exacerbated by direct pressure on his foot. He notes
pain extending from his mid calf until the top of his thigh.
.
Patient was sent to the emergency department. Initial vitals
were T 97.9, HR 116, BP 124/85, R 20, O2 Sat 98% on 4L.  He
triggered on arrival for a pulseless right foot. Initially the
emergency department was concerned for arterial compromise. An
ultrasound of the RLE showed evidence of a full RLE DVT.
Vascular surgery was consulted and felt that the limb was
non-threatened as patient had palpable right femoral, popliteal,
and DP pulses and recommended anticoagulation when safe,
elevation of RLE, and ACE wrap.
.
In ED patient also complained intermittent, vague abdominal
pain. He had a CT Abdomen/Pelvis showing a stable liver
hematoma.  The CT also showed the IVC filter with clot extending
2.2 cm above the filter in the IVC.  Patient was evaluated by
transplant surgery who felt there was no role for surgical
intervenstion adn the risk/benefit of anticoagulation in the
setting of liver hematoma should be made by primary team.
Patient received no medications or blood. He received 1.5 L of
IVF.  On transfer vitals were T 100.1, HR 124, BP 138/98, RR 27,
O2 sat 98RA.
.
On the floor, patient reports that he has leg pain from his
right mid-posterior calf extending up though thigh to his right
groin.  He has some mild numbness and tingling on the back of
his right calf.  He denies abdominal pain unless someone presses
down on his abdomen.  He denies chest pain, dyspnea,
lightheadedness, syncope.  His abdominal pain is improved from
his last admission.  Patient has noted recent weight loss and
decreased appetite recently. Endorses fatigue and weakness.

RLE Ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: Vein thrombosis seen throughout the entire extent of
the right
lower extremity. Dampened waveforms in contralateral left common
femoral vein are suggestive of more proximal thrombosis.

CTA Aorta, Bifem, Iliac:
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent three-vessel runoff.
2. Findings in the abdomen and pelvis, including subcapsular
liver hematoma and IVC thrombus extending into the right common
iliac, external iliac, and likely common femoral veins as well
as possibly into the left common iliac vein, better assessed on
CT abdomen/pelvis performed just prior to this, on [**2185-5-11**] at
21:50, see that report.
3. Apparent diffuse wall thickening of the urinary bladder may
relate to its underdistension, however, recommend correlation
with urinalysis to exclude underlying infection.
4. Enlarged prostate gland; recommend correlation with serum PSA
if this has not already been performed.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. 17 x 19 x 6 cm subcapsular liver hematoma, which appears
stable compared to the [**Month (only) 547**] examination. Active extravasation
does not appear present, but is limited on this single-phase
study.
2. IVC filter with a clot extending cephalad 2.2 cm above the
top of the
filter. However, thrombus does not extend into the renal veins.
Occlusive
thrombus into the right common iliac internal and external
iliacs and common femoral vein. There may be partially occlusive
thrombus in the left common iliac.
