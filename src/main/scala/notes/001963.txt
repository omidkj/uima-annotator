Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ultrafiltration
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
(History obtained from son and OSH record)
76 yo F with history of CKD recently started on hemodialysis (2
cycles as of [**7-20**]), h/o CVA x2, h/o RCC s/p nephrectomy, and
recent known [**Hospital **] transferred from the OSH to the ICU for planned
GI work-up; however, was in respiratory distress requiring
intubation in the [**Hospital1 **] ED.
.
Per the son, she has been having increased lethargy, decreased
energy, as well as LE swelling.  Patient reported having had at
least 1 week of melena and 1 day of hematemesis on [**2129-7-15**].
This led to her admission to [**Hospital **] Hospital on [**2129-7-15**].
At the OSH ED, she was noteded to have BRBPR and initial Hct of
25.3 from 30.5 on [**7-12**] and 34.4 on [**6-7**].  Per OSH record, her NG
lavage in the ED was negative.  Her hemodynamics remained
stable.  Subsequently, she was on Protonix gtt and IV hydration
with GI consult.  Her plavix was held.  She apparently underwent
an endoscopy by DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 30885**], which showed a bleeding friable
large pyloric channel stalk polyp 4-5 cm as well as gastric
mucosal friability.  Per discharge summary, patient vomited
blood on [**7-19**] and received DDAVP.  During her time in the OSH,
she was initiated on hemodialysis per her nephrologist's
recommendations.  Per the son, patient was supposed to be
transferred over on [**7-19**] but did not get here until [**7-20**].
.
Per the son, she had a colonoscopy that was not remarkable,
except for polyps, last year.
.
Patient received a cycle of dialysis today before transfer.
.
Per ED report, patient became hypoxic en route to the 70s to
endoscopy, so was rerouted to the ED.  At triage, HR 69, BP
167/66, RR 25, O2Sat 85% on BiPAP.  There was concern of
pneumonia vs. fluid overload.  She was placed on BiPAP then was
intubated for hypoxic respiratory distress on fentanyl and
propofol.  Apparently, OG tube lavage did not show blood.  Per
ED report, patient had a living will from [**2117**] with DNR/DNI, but
this was discussed with patient prior to intubation, and she
agreed to it.  She was given protonix 80 mg IV 1x, vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and zosyn.  Nephrology and GI were made aware of
her.  Bedside echocardiogram showed small pericardial effusion
with left sided pleural effusion.  Upon transfer, HR 58, BP
142/58, RR 16, O2Sat 100% on FiO2 80%, TV 400, RR set 18, and
PEEP of 10 with fentanyl and propofol for sedation.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she was quickly extubated without complication on
[**7-21**] after HD ultrafiltration. She has been on 2L NC since. Echo
showed EF 50% with apical hypokinesis attributed NSTEMI during
this admission although trop elevations are only modest
considering renal function and CK/MB not elevated. EKG notable
for non-specific t-wave changes. She is on plavix as an outpt
for hx of CVA, but this has been held in setting of GIB.
.
In terms of her GI bleed, she was found to have a large polyp
leading to obstruction of pylorus. She was transfused [**2129-7-23**] 1
unit of pRBCs. Patient also noted to have bleeding [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
tear on EGD on Monday [**2129-7-25**], after which she had 20 cc
hematemesis but has had none since and has been hemodynamically
stable the entire hospitalization throughout [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay. She has
been on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI, transitioned to PO PPI today and tolerating
po intake. Her last transfusion was today [**7-27**] with HD, at which
time she got 1 unit PRBC. She has received total 2 units (one
today, one on [**7-23**]).
.
Her course was also complicated by MSSA bacteremia and a
hematoma next to her AV fistula. Blood cultures drawn on
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] grew MSSA, one out of four bottles. She is on
cefazolin with Hemodialysis (2/2/3 g after HD on M/W/F, today
day 7 of 14 - last day [**8-3**]). Initial concern for infected
fistula given mild tenderness but ultrasound ok and vascular
felt it was very unlikely (no graft). Subsequent cultures x 6
days no growth to date.
.
She also had thrombocytopenia and Plt 142 on presentation, that
decreased to nadir of 69. Patient has not been on heparin at
[**Hospital1 18**], but unclear if received at OSH or with hemodialysis. PF4
neg. Plts since rose to 110.
In terms of ESRD, patient received HD session prior to transfer
to the floor.
Vitals in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to transfer to floor were as follows: T
98.7, BP 128/64, P 70, RR 14, O2sat 99% 2L. Pt arrived at the
floor with no complaint of pain.
