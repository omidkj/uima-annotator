Admission Date:  [**2143-12-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2143-12-5**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 84-year-old female
with a history of coronary artery disease, referred by her
primary care physician for cardiac catheterization due to a
positive stress test obtained on [**2143-11-13**].

The patient had been admitted under CMI service and had
tolerated the cardiac catheterization well, however,
following cardiac catheterization, she developed hypotension
at which time, she was transferred to the CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 45%
on an echocardiogram from [**2143-11-6**].
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4. Arthritis.
5. History of cerebrovascular accident according to her
hospital record, but the patient denies any history of CVA.
6. GERD.
7. History of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear 10 cm in [**2143-5-2**]
requiring multiple transfusions.
8. Status post partial hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:
1. Valium.
2. Ativan.
3. Protonix.
4. IV dye.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lopressor.
2. Norvasc.
3. Furosemide.
4. Quinine.
5. Lipitor.
6. Lisinopril.
7. Amitriptyline.
8. Prevacid.
9. Aspirin.
10. Albuterol inhaler.
11. Nitro-Dur patch.
12. Plavix.
13. Vioxx.
14. Insulin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives alone.  The patient received
premedications for her dye allergy including Zantac,
prednisone, and Benadryl.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CCU:  Notable for a
temperature of 95.5, heart rate of 80 on pacemaker, and a
blood pressure of 100/40 on dopamine drip.  The patient is
confused and agitated.  Her abdomen is distended and tender.
She has good lower extremity pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORIES:  Notable for a creatinine of 0.3 and a
hematocrit of 28.  INR is 2.6.  PTT is 150.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient on admission underwent cardiac
catheterization.  She was found to have a right coronary
artery, which was diffusely diseased.  Her LAD showed 95%
stenosis which was stented.  Her left circumflex did not
require stenting.  Following cardiac catheterization, the
patient developed an episode of hypotension with a blood
pressure down to the 70s.  Her heart rate did not change due
to the pacemaker.  The patient received 1.5 mg of atropine,
which increased her blood pressure.

Her femoral sheath was pulled later in the day.  She again
became hypotensive and there was high suspicion for
retroperitoneal bleed.  A bedside echocardiogram was obtained
to rule out cardiac tamponade.  There was no evidence of
pericardial effusion on bedside echocardiogram.  Patient was
aggressively fluid resuscitated and was started on dopamine
drip for blood pressure support.  At that time the patient
was agitated and somewhat confused.

The CCU team was called to admit her.  The patient was taken
to CT for evaluation of a possible retroperitoneal bleed.  CT
scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a large retroperitoneal
bleed.  The patient was transferred to the Trauma SICU to be
followed by the CCU team.  The patient received multiple
blood products including 6 units of packed red blood cells, 6
units of FFP, and two apheresis units of platelets over the
next three hours.

A Vascular Surgery consult was obtained to evaluate for
possible surgical intervention.  At that time, she had
palpable femoral pulses bilaterally as well as dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibial pulses.  It was felt that the limbs were
not acutely threatened, and they recommended continued
medical management by quickly correcting her coagulopathy as
well as resuscitating with blood.  Patient was able to be
briefly weaned off dopamine.

At 1:30 in the morning, however, the patient complained of
shortness of breath.  She then began to vomit.  At that time,
heart rate and blood pressure were stable, but then she
became unresponsive to verbal or noxious stimuli.  Anesthesia
was called to intubated for respiratory distress.  She soon
lost palpable pulses and a code was called.  The patient was
coded for approximately 30 minutes before she was finally
pronounced at 1:59 a.m. in the morning.

The family was notified of the patient's death.  Hematocrit
taken shortly before the code was 24 despite having received
6 units of packed red blood cells.  Her abdomen over the
course of the night had greatly increased in size.  It is
highly suspected that patient most likely went into cardiac
arrest due to continued massive retroperitoneal bleed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Cardiac arrest due to large
retroperitoneal bleed.
