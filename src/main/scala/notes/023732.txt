Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7744**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsening shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
rigid bronchoscopy and tracheostomy [**2107-4-29**]


History of Present Illness:
67yo female with a history of schizoaffective disorder, DM, HTN
with a history of respiratory failure requiring intubation, then
failure to wean off ventilator (required trach and PEG), now
with post-intubation tracheal stenosis requiring multiple
bronchoscopic procedures with trials of T tubes, tracheostomy
tubes.

This morning she woke up feeling like her normal self. She
usually has a feeling of phlegm in her throat, and for the last
4 days or so her chronic cough has become productive of yellow
sputum. She has had temps up to 99F, but no frank fevers. No
chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, or worsening LE edema.
After breakfast, around 9am, she acutely felt 'tight', like she
was 'breathing through a straw'. She became very anxious, and
reportedly desaturated to the mid 80's on room air. EMS was
called to her nursing home, but she said she was more relaxed
and her symptoms had improved by the time she was being taken
away by ambulance an hour later. She had one briefer episode of
difficulty breathing in the ambulance, but only lasted about 10
minutes.

Of note, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has been recommending tracheal resection and
reconstruction. However, the patient has been reluctant.

In the ED, initial VS were: 96.6,146/66,76,19,100 @2L
CXR was clear, and a 20G was placed in the R hand. She was given
albuterol nebs.
Vitals prior to transfer were  96.6,146/66,76,19,100 @2L.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient reported feeling her
baseline. On ROS she notes 3 loose bowel movements per day. She
denies nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria. At baseline she
walks with a walker and has not had worsening dyspnea on
exertion or chest pain. She has some chronic joint pains in her
hands. No rash. All other ROS negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient is a 67yo female s/p
post intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure with subsequent
tracheal stenosis, s/p multiple IP procedures, who presents with
an episode of stridor and difficulty breathing. The episode
self-resolved but given patient's tenuous airway with stenosis
and increased sputum, she was admitted for observation and
potential IP management.

ACUTE CARE:
# Tracheal stenosis:
Unclear whether this was a discrete episode, or a worsening that
requires urgent intervention, but patient did experience desats
to 80's at rehab. While she's had an increase in yellowish
sputum, but no fevers and no leukocytosis to suggest infection.
Given that she was not having difficulty breathing following
admission she was not given a repeat dose of steroids and there
was no evidence to start antibiotics. The patient was seen by IP
who recommended tracheal resection and reconstruction with
thoracic surgery, however, the patient deferred in favor of
repeat trach. She underwent successful trach on [**2107-4-29**] w/
placement of #6 cuffed Portex, and resumed a normal diet on
[**2107-4-30**] with no issues. Pt had minimal pain and bleeding after
the procedure. Pt was discharged to [**Hospital1 1501**] w/ instruction for the
facility to provide a portex thermovent tracheostomy valve to be
used during the day and then removed at night and leave to the
trach collar humidifier. The portex thermovent tracheostomy
valve will need to be changed daily. The [**Hospital1 1501**] will also provide
Passy Muir valve to be used during the day as needed to aid with
speech. Pt will use only the Trach collar at night.
The rehab facility should remove the 2 sutures holding the trach
in 2 weeks and keep the trach collar belt on thereafter. IP has
also recommended red cap trials as tolerated for one hour at a
time starting on Tuesday [**2107-5-3**].

# Anemia
Patient with chronic anemia likely due to anemia of chronic
disease.  Did note a HCT drop from baseline 33-35 to 31
following tracheostomy. No signs of active bleeding and patient
remained hemodynamically stable. Would recommend repeat HCT upon
discharge to ensure remains stable.

# Urinary Retention
Patient developed urinary retention following IP procedure.
Possibly related to anesthesia. Patient does report h/o urinary
retention with previous hospitalizations. Bladder scan revealed
up to 800cc urine. Patient straight cathed several times, then
foley placed on [**2107-5-1**]. She will need a voiding trial in about
two days. If she continues to have difficulty voiding, could
consider holding Benztropine as this can cause urinary retention
with further investigation of underlying cause.

CHRONIC CARE
# Diabetes:
Continued hom
