Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo woman s/p PEA arrest.

# PEA arrest:
Spoke with both sons, including HCP [**Name (NI) 401**].  They confirmed
patient's DNR/DNI status.  Upon admission to the ICU, it was
difficult to assess neurologic status because she was still
hypothermic.  While she was being warmed to reassess her status,
her BP dropped and she became increasingly bradycardic.  Both
sons, including [**Name (NI) 401**] (the patient's HCP), were present and agreed
not to code the patient.  She died at 4:23pm on [**2195-1-18**].

The attending was present and the patient's PCP was informed.
The family declined autopsy.
