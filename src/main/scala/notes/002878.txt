Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**]
Chief Complaint:
low blood pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Admission note and OMR were reviewed. Pt was examined.  Briefly,
per admission note, "this is a 59 yo F with NSCLC dx in [**3-22**],
COPD, CAD s/p MI, has 2 recent admissions one with PNA and the
other with hemoptysis in [**3-22**], who presented with tremors and
HR 150.  Pt had just completed her last radiation tx day PTA
(total of 14 tx) for both spine met and lung mass."  The pt was
asymptomatic and admitted to stopping her metoprolol the day PTA
for low BP. In ED, found to have BP 80's/50's responded to IVF.
CTA was neg for PE, but showed a possible adrenal met and a
lytic/sclerotic density in a compression fracture of T7 with
probable posterior epidural extension of mass into spinal canal
(seen on MRI [**3-22**]). Got 2L IVF, 2.5 mg metop x3 with HR dropped
to 115's.  The pt was monitored overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. She was
started on low dose metoprolol and a heparin gtt for the
pulmonary vein filling defect.


Past Medical History:
Onc History:
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-3-22**] with hemoptysis. At that time
she was found to have a 8x8x9cm mass in the RUL displacing
segmental bronchi of the RML but no clear invasion. CT guided
biopsy showed non small cell lung CA. She had a PET and an MRI
and found to have a T7 likely metastatic lesion.  She underwent
radiation treatment of both her spine mets and lung mass in
[**4-21**].  She is to receive palliative chemo.
.
PMH
-Diverticular bleeds, most recently in [**2152-9-16**].
-Strep pneumoniae pneumonia and sepsis and a prolonged intensive

care unit stay complicated by difficulty extubating, delirium,
and right internal carotid artery cannulization.
-HTN
-hyperlipidemia
-COPD
-panic disorder
-CAD with a MI infarction in [**2144**]. - EF 55% based on echo [**3-20**]
- hypothyroidism


Social History:
She is retired from working in [**Company 2486**].  She smoked two
packs per day for 40 years and quit four years ago. She does not
use alcohol.


Family History:
She has no siblings. Her mother passed away at age 76 of
osteoporosis and severe emphysema. Her father died at age 56 of
lung cancer, though he was a nonsmoker. She has no children. She
is widowed.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**4-25**]:
There is a large lobulated mass in the right upper lobe
measuring about 9 cm in greatest dimension and without change
from the prior radiograph.  Heart size and mediastinal contours
are within normal limits.  There is emphysema. No acute new
pulmonary abnormalities are identified. IMPRESSION:  Persistent
large neoplastic right upper lobe mass, in keeping with lung
cancer.  No new pulmonary abnormalities.
.
CTA:
1.  No evidence for pulmonary arterial embolus. There is a
filling defect within a right upper lobe pulmonary vein at the
inferior margin of the large RUL mass which may represent venous
tumor invasion or thrombus. 2.  Lytic/sclerotic density in a
compression fracture of T7 with probable posterior epidural
extension of mass into spinal canal at this level. An MRI exam
would provide better evaluation for cord compression. 3.
Unchanged large right upper lung lobe mass consistent with the
patient's history of lung cancer.
4.  New left adrenal lesion measuring 9 mm concerning for
further metastatic disease. 5.  Cholelithiasis without evidence
for cholecystitis.
.
EKG: SVT at 150, V3-V6 ST depression, II, III, F ST depression.


Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 59 yo F with newly diagnosed NSCLC who
presented with hypotension and tachycardia. The pt was monitored
overnight in the ICU and then transferred to the floor.
.
# Tachycardia:  The pt was started on metoprolol in the ICU at a
low dose given her hypotension.  EKG was most c/w sinus
tachycardia.  She was hydrated with 2L normal saline on
admission with mild decrease in pulse.  On transfer to the floor
her HR was Still 110s-130s.  Initially, titration of pts
metoprolol was been limited by pts blood pressure.  Her EKG was
faxed to cardiology who confirmed this was sinus tachycardia.
The cause of her sinus tachycardia is unclear, but from prior
[**Name (NI) 21831**] over the past several years, the pts HR has varied from
60s-105.  At baseline the pt may already be a little
tachycardic.  The pt was hydrated with 2 more L of NS on the
floor with no decrease in her pulse.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was
performed given her recent dexamethasone course, but this was
WNL.  The pts possible pulmonary vein thrombus was not felt to
be contributing to her tachycardia.  TTE was negative for a
pericardial effusion.  The pt seemed anxious, but she refused
ativan or any medication changes to her psychiatric drugs.  Her
metoprolol was ultimately changed to atenolol and will need
follow up with her PCP.
.
# Hypotension: The pts initial hypotension on admission improved
after IVF.  The pts metoprolol could not be increased back up to
her prior dose of 100 [**Hospital1 **] given that her blood pressure remained
low (SBP 90-100).  She was titrated up to atenolol 50 mg po qd.
Pt becomes hypotensive in the setting of increase heart rate and
receiving
.
# Filling defect on right upper lobe pulmonary vein: CT chest
shows a RUL pulm vein filling defect at the inferior margin of
the large RUL mass which may represent venous tumor invasion or
thrombus. It is possible pt has an in situ thrombus from a
malignancy-related hypercoaguable state. On discussion with
radiology, there is no definitive way to tell if this is
thrombus vs tumor invasion, but there appears to be some
continuity with the tumor. The pt will likely need to be on
lifelong anticoagulation.  She was started on a heparin gtt in
the ICU.  Once transferred to the floor she was started on
coumadin 5 mg po qd with a Lovenox bridge. Her INR was
therapeutic at the time of discharge.
.
# Fever: The pt had a low grade fever on [**4-27**].  She had no clear
sign of infection or elevated WBC. She only had a mild cough.
The pt was started on levoflox on [**4-27**] for a 10 day course for
empiric treatment of pneumonia.
.
# NSCLC: Pt has likely T7 mets. There is also a new ?adrenal met
on CT. She is s/p XRT. She received palliative chemo with
[**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol on [**5-1**].
.
# CAD s/p MI s/p RCA stent in '[**44**]; preserved EF.  Pt had some ST
depressions on admission EKG, likely in the setting of demand
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.She was continued on
ASA, BB, statin.  Her lisinopril was held due to low BP.  This
can be restarted as an outpatient as her BP tolerates.
.
