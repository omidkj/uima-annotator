[**2180-6-19**] CXR
New ill-defined opacities in the right middle and lower lobes.
Considering history of fever, this could represent an
early/evolving pneumonia. Followup radiographs may be helpful.

[**2180-6-13**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1) The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage.
2) A patent foramen ovale is present.
3) There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
4) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5) The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6) The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.
7) There is no pericardial effusion.

Postbypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function. Overall LVEF 60%.
Ascending aorta is free of any free dissection flaps. There is a
small hematoma noted during the aortic cannulation and it has
not increased in size. The hematoma is probably 1 X 1cm. Aortic
arch and descending thoracic aorta are free of any dissection
flaps. A bioprosthesis is seen in the native aortic position,
stable in postion and functioning well with a peak and a mean of
20 and 10mm of HG.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67002**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2180-6-12**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner and deemed suitable for surgery. On
[**2180-6-13**], Ms. [**Known lastname 67002**] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent an aortic valve replacement utilizing a 19mm St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] pericardial tissue valve. Postoperatively she was taken
to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. She
was weaned from sedation and awoke neurologically intact. A
steroid taper was continued for her preoperative COPD
exacerbation. Aspirin, beta blockade and a statin were resumed.
She was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit
for further recovery. Ms. [**Known lastname 67002**] was gently diuresed toward
her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. During the early hours of postoperative day three, Ms.
[**Known lastname 67002**] fell. Work-up was negative and an ice pack was applied
to her knee. A On postoperative day 6, Ms. [**Known lastname 67002**] developed a
fever. She was pan cultured which was negative and a lower
extremity ultrasound was negative for a deep vein thrombosis.
Antibiotics (dicloxacillin and vancomycin)were prophylactically
started. She defervesced and her cultures remained negative. On
potoperative day seven, Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 67003**] was discharged from the
hospital in stable condition to her home. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist and her primary care physician
as an outpatient.
