Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Redo Aortic Valve Replacemetn (mechanical) on [**2179-2-16**]

History of Present Illness:
50 yr old female with h/o Rheumatic Heart Disease/Mitral
Stenosis/Aortic Insufficiency s/p Mitral Valve Replacement
(mechanical) and Aortic Valve Replacement (mechanical) [**2165**] who
has been c/o increasingly worsening dyspnea on exertion. An echo
revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with an increased
trans-aortic gradient with a peak gradient of 85mmHg and a mean
gradient of 49mmHG (Aortic Stenosis). She then underwent a
cardiac cath which showed clean coronary arteries and similar
disease with the prosthetic mechanical aortic valve. She was
then seen for redo-aortic valve replacement.

Physical Exam:
Neuro: A&O x 3, non-focal
Heart: RRR 4/6 SEM
Lungs: CTAB -w/r/r
Abd: Soft, NT/ND +BS
Ext: Warm, Trace edema

Pertinent Results:
Carotid U/S [**2-15**]: No evidence of carotid stenosis in the right
or left carotid arteries
Echo [**2-16**]: Pre bypass: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The
right atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). A mechanical aortic
valve prosthesis is present. Motion of the aortic  prosthesis
leaflets/discs is abnormal. Only one leaflet seen to move
normally.  The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for
this type of prosthesis. There is at least moderate to severe
aortic valve stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8, mean gradient 27). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. A mechanical mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The prosthetic mitral leaflets appear
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. Post bypass: preserved
Biventricular function LVEF > 55%. Mechanical [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) **] 21
prosthesis well seated in aortic position without perivavluar
leak. No AI. Aortic valve area 1.7-1.9 by continuity, Peak
gradient 58, Mean 29 mm Hg initally post bypass, subsuqently
peak gradient 52, mean 16 mm Hg. Mitral valve prosthesis remains
unchanged. TR and PI unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted prior to her surgery secondary to being on
Coumadin for her current prosthetic mechanical valves. Her
Coumadin was stopped and she was started on Heparin. She had her
pre-operative work-up done along with a carotid u/s. On [**2-16**] her
INR was at a safe level for surgery and she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent a redo Aortic Valve
Replacement with a mehanical valve. Please see op note for
surgical details. She was then brought to the CSRU in stable
condition. Later on op day patient was weaned from sedation and
awoke neurologically intact and was then extubated. She was
weaned from all Inotropes by post op day one and was started on
B blockers and diuretics. She was gently diuresed throughout her
hospital course towards her pre-operative weight. On post-op day
two she was transferred to the cardiac surgery step-down unit.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op
day two. Coumadin was restarted on this day as well. Physical
therapy worked with patient during entire post-op course for
strength and mobility. She appeared to be progressing well
although on post-op day four she had some abdmonial pain, but
abdmonial x-ray was negative. By post-op day five she was
ambulating well and cleared level 5. Her INR was therapeutic and
she was discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate
follow-up appointments.
