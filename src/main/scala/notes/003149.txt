Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was referred from an
outside hospital with a chief complaint of increasing
shortness of breath and tires easily with exertion.  Admitted
to [**Hospital 4628**] Hospital in [**2184-10-25**] in congestive heart
failure at that time.  Via echocardiogram, found to have
aortic stenosis.  Referred to [**Hospital1 188**] for cardiac catheterization to further evaluate her
aortic stenosis.  Cardiac catheterization done on [**1-10**]
showed an aortic valve area of .38 cm.sq., with a mean
gradient of 62, and a peak gradient of 85.  Moderate
pulmonary hypertension, PA pressure 48/24, 1+ mitral
regurgitation, severe aortic stenosis with an LVEDP of 19 and
an ejection fraction of 43%.  She was then referred to
Cardiothoracic Surgery for aortic valve replacement.

1.  Aortic stenosis
2.  Diabetes mellitus Type 2
3.  Right hip replacement
4.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Include Glucovance 5/500 one

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Vital signs:  Heart rate 108 and
regular, blood pressure 145/76, respiratory rate 20, height
5'2", weight 141 pounds.  General:  Healthy-appearing woman,
in no acute distress.  Skin:  No lesions or rashes.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and

not injected.  Oropharynx:  Mucous membranes moist.  Neck:
Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention, no
thyromegaly.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, with III/VI blowing
murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal
active bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:
Warm and well perfused, with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema,
no varicosities.  Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through
XII grossly intact.  Moves all extremities.  Strength 5/5 in
upper and lower extremities.  Sensation intact in all
dermatomes.  Pulses:  Femoral 2+ bilaterally, dorsalis pedis
1+ bilaterally, posterior tibial 1+ bilaterally, and radial
2+ bilaterally.  No carotid bruits were noted.

LABORATORY DATA:   White count 5.3, hematocrit 43, platelets
200.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.9, chloride 102, CO2 25, BUN
24, creatinine 0.9, glucose 309.  Electrocardiogram:  Rate of
91, first degree AV block, intervals .22, .92, .36, with left
ventricular hypertrophy.  Chest x-ray is pending at the time
of physical.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was a direct admission to the
operating room on [**2-15**], at which time she underwent an
aortic valve replacement.  Please see the operative report
for full details.  In summary, she had an aortic valve
replacement with a #21 mosaic porcine valve.  She tolerated
the operation well, and was transferred from the operating
room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period,
however, her blood pressure remained somewhat labile.
Therefore, she was continued on a Neo-Synephrine drip to
maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 110.  In
addition, she was slow to awaken after her anesthesia was
reversed, and in several attempts to wean from the
ventilator, she developed a respiratory acidosis.  She
therefore remained on the ventilator throughout the day of
postoperative day one.

On postoperative day two, the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  Her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned
to off.  She was again weaned from the ventilator, and
successfully extubated.  Her chest tubes were discontinued
and, at the end of the day, she was transferred from the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit to the floor for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

After being transferred to the floor, the patient did well.
Over the next several days, her activity level was increased
with the assistance of Physical Therapy and the nursing
staff.  She remained hemodynamically stable.  Her respiratory
condition remained stable and, on postoperative day four, she
was deemed stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and physical
therapy.

At the time of transfer, the patient's physical examination
is as follows:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 78
and sinus rhythm, blood pressure 106/50, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 97% on room air.  Weight preoperatively was
67 kg, at discharge is 70.9 kg.  Laboratory data on [**2-18**]:  White count 4.1, hematocrit 23, platelets 144.  Sodium
141, potassium 4.3, chloride 108, CO2 25, BUN 24, creatinine
0.8, glucose 140.  Physical examination:  Alert and oriented
x 3, moves all extremities, conversant.  Respiratory:
Scattered rhonchi with diminished breath sounds in the bases.
Cor:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, with soft systolic
ejection murmur.  Sternum is stable.  Incision with staples,
open to air, clean and dry.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Warm
and well perfused, with no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Ranitidine 150 mg twice a day,
enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg once daily, Glucovance 5/500
one tablet twice a day, metoprolol 25 mg twice a day,
Furosemide 20 mg once daily for 14 days, potassium chloride
20 mEq once daily for 14 days, Colace 100 mg twice a day,
Niferex 150 mg once daily, Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets
every four hours as needed, ibuprofen 400 mg every six hours
as needed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Aortic stenosis status post aortic valve replacement with
a #21 mosaic porcine valve
2.  Diabetes mellitus Type 2
3.  Right hip replacement

CONDITION ON TRANSFER:  Stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:   She is to have follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month, and follow up in the [**Hospital 409**] Clinic in two
weeks.
