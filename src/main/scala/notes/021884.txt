Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
infected av graft

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
removal of infected left arm graft [**2144-5-16**]
TEE [**2144-5-20**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 47 year old
male, well known to us, who presented with a small fluctuant
area overlying the graft.  This was in the vicinity of a
known seroma and we were uncertain if this was infected being
as he was having no fevers, no pain, and no erythema.  Blood
cultures were obtained as an outpatient and when these came
back positive, we admitted him for a graft excision

Past Medical History:
ESRD on HD (MWF), HCV, HIV, malignant HTN

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2144-5-16**] 1:57 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for pulm edema

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
47 year old man with ESRD, extubated in OR, required
re-intubation in OR for shallow breaths
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pulm edema
CLINICAL HISTORY: End-stage renal disease, intubated.

CHEST: The tip of the endotracheal tube lies 3 cm from the
carinal angle. The heart is enlarged. Costophrenic angles appear
sharp. There is a diffuse increase in overall opacification of
both the lung fields. I am unsure whether this is technical or
represents some pathology. Followup films suggested.

IMPRESSION: Mild increase in overall opacity of the lungs of
uncertain significance. Continued followup recommended.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. A 1.6cm mobile linear echodensity
is noted in
the left atrium attached to the mitral annulus. There is no
mitral valve
prolapse. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of
[**2143-9-5**], the mobile linear echodensity is new and c/w a
vegetation.
If clinically indicated, a TEE is suggested to better define the
mitral
annulus abnormality.
Reason: Dialysis line temporary infected with strep viridens

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
47 year old man with ESRD. AV graft infected sp graft removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Dialysis line temporary infected with strep viridens
TEMPORARY DIALYSIS CATHETER PLACEMENT

INDICATION: Renal failure.

Details of the procedure and possible complications were
explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained.

RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**] was performing the procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique, local anesthesia and
conscious sedation, the right internal jugular vein was
localized with ultrasound and accessed with a micropuncture set
under direct ultrasound guidance. Hard copies of ultrasound
images before and after access of the internal jugular vein were
obtained. The tract was dilated with sequential dilators and
12.5 French temporary dialysis catheter placed over the wire
with its tip positioned in the right atrium under fluoroscopic
guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by chest x-ray
in one view.

The catheter was secured to the skin.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided
placement of the temporary dialysis catheter via the right
internal jugular venous approach.
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. There
are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly
thickened with focal calcifications of the aortic root. No
masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve
abscess is seen. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally
normal. There is irregular mitral annular calcification with
calcified, fairly
immobile, "frond- like" projections from the posterior mitral
annulus (on the
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]). No definite mobile vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve or on the
mitral valve annulus. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no
abscess of the tricuspid valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on
the pulmonic
valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Impression: No definite
