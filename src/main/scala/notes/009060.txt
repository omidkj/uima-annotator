Aorta - Ascending:  *3.9 cm  <= 3.4 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction.
Inferobasal LV aneurysm.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**1-22**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre-bypass: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with LVEF = 45%.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2180-5-19**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken urgently to the operating room and
underwent urgent coronary artery bypass graft x4.(Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous
vein grafts to ramus, obtuse marginal and posterior descending
arteries).Please refer to the operative for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU on
NeoSynephrine and Propofol. Weaned off pressors and sedation, he
awoke neurologically intact, however he was then placed on
Fentnyl/Versed drips to assist him through delerium
tremens.POD#3 he was extubated without difficulty. He remained
confused  and intermittently delerious.All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion. Beta-blocker/Aspirin/Statin,
and diuresis were initiated. Swallowing evaluation performed due
to  postextubation dysphagia. Diet advanced with recovery.
Mr.[**Known lastname 86526**] mental status gradually improved and on POD#10 he was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical therapy was consulted for evaluation of his strength
and mobility. He continued to progress and was cleared by
Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **] for discharge to [**Hospital 21341**] rehabilitation in [**Location (un) 6151**] on
POD# 11. All follow up
