Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ED and was seen in the waiting
area.  She was promptly transferred to the OR for washout and
closure for dehiscence of her DP wound which she tolerated well.
 She was started on Vancomycin, levaquin, and Flagyl
empirically.  Her anticoagulation regimen consisted of aspirin,
plavix, and coumadin.  The patient's activity was limited to
bedrest and her left lower extremity was elevated while in bed.
Routine pulse exams were done to ensure patency of the graft.
The wound was monitored for 3 days post-operatively and remained
stable.  The patient was then discharged to home with vna
services for wound care in good condition, tolerating a regular
diet and with adequate pain control.
