Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 81-year-old male
with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, one
vessel coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease,
bilateral renal artery stenosis.  Patient is recently status
post elective repair of AAA on [**2195-8-26**] that was complicated
by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus bacteremia as well
as bilobar pneumonia.  He was sent to a rehab facility on
levofloxacin on [**2195-9-7**].  Patient was doing well at acute
rehabilitation until two days prior to admission when he
developed diarrhea, fevers to 101, and hypotension with
systolic blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient was started
empirically on Flagyl for Clostridium difficile and
levofloxacin was discontinued on [**2195-9-14**].  Per medication
sheet, patient was also on clindamycin for unclear reason.

Patient also reports that he fell one day prior to admission
and hit his head.  Denies loss of consciousness.  He
complains of bilateral hip pain with erythema over his left
lower extremity.  In the Emergency Room, initial vital signs:
temperature of 99.0, blood pressure 89/44, pulse 98,
respirations 22, and 100% on room air.  Patient subsequently
became increasingly hypertensive with a systolic blood
pressure in the 70s and was bolused with 1 liter of normal
saline and started on dopamine drip.  The patient was
evaluated by Vascular Surgery and General Surgery in the
Emergency Room, and was admitted to the MICU for further
evaluation and management.

CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:  Ill-defined nodular
opacity in the left lung with increased size of right lung,
bilateral pleural effusions, small ascites, patent graft,
simple fluid collection around left ileac graft.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Clostridium difficile colitis:  On admission, Vascular
Surgery and General Surgery were consulted, who recommended
conservative management of Clostridium difficile colitis at
this time as CT scan showed no evidence of megacolon and the
patient continued to pass diarrhea and flatus.  Patient was
continued on empiric Flagyl po for Clostridium difficile
colitis.  Stool was positive for Clostridium difficile toxin.

Patient was conservatively managed initially with a
nasogastric tube, NPO, serial abdominal examinations, and
rectal tube.  On transfer from the unit to the floor on
[**2195-9-18**], rectal tube was discontinued as was nasogastric
tube.  Serial KUBs in the unit showed no evidence of
obstruction or megacolon.  Abdominal examination began to
improve following transfer to the floor.

On [**2195-9-18**] at 8 pm, a KUB showed increased dilation of the
colon compared to prior [**9-16**] KUB.  This was reviewed with
the radiologist, who noted some areas of the colon dilated up
to 10 cm.  The diameter of the cecum could not be determined.
On examination, the patient was more distended than prior
examination with less active bowel sounds, but there was no
............ increased tenderness and no rebound or guarding.
Patient's blood pressure and temperature were stable.
Patient was still passing diarrhea and flatus with no nausea
or vomiting.  These findings were discussed with surgery, who
recommended no rectal tube at this time, and recommended
serial abdominal examinations with frequent reassessments.

Patient was closely monitored over the next few days, and his
abdominal examination improved with decreased abdominal pain,
increased bowel sounds, and no evidence of perforation.
Patient was started on sips of clear liquids on [**2195-9-21**],
which was slowly advanced to a soft diet on [**2195-9-23**].  At
time of discharge, the patient is tolerating soft diet with
decreased stool output, although he continued to have
diarrhea.  Abdominal examination improved since admission.

The patient's white blood cell count which was 35 on
admission, gradually decreased to a nadir of 10 on [**2195-9-21**].
At time of discharge, patient's white blood cell count 13.9.
Patient will continue for a 14 day course of po Flagyl
postdiscontinuation of oxacillin on [**2195-9-23**].  At time of
discharge, patient is on day one of this 14 day course.

2. Hypotension:  Hypotension noted on admission likely
secondary to hypovolemia.  Cardiogenic shock was initially a
concern as this patient has known coronary artery disease,
however, this was deemed less likely given patient's cardiac
output of 9.  Septic shock was also in the differential given
fevers and likely bowel infection, however, the .............
vascular resistance was greater than 500,
