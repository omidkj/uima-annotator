Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 19844**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2139-5-21**] R colectomy w/ primary ileocolonic anastomosis

History of Present Illness:
75M with previous history of LGIB in setting of known
diverticulosis who presents with dark red lower GI bleed.
Patient first noticed profuse and spontaneous "darkish red
blood" around 9 am on Tuesday ([**5-19**]).  He experienced another
3-4 episodes precipitating visit to ED at 2pm.  Reports
dizziness with some mild chest pain at the time of his bleeding.
 He denied any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting/hematemesis,
fever, coughing, or changes in bowel movements.

He notes that he did not eat much on the day of presentation,
other than some bananas in the morning.  Patient denies taking
any over the counter medications to ease the bleeding.  His last
colonoscopy was in [**2133**] and the patient believes he was told
that he had diverticulosis.

At time of consultation, AFVSS, 2u pRBC without appropriate
hematocrit response, CTA without active extravasation,
hemodynamically appropriate, GI consultation pending.


Past Medical History:
MGUS, COPD, Asthma, Epilepsy (with 3-4 "grand-mal seizures"
in the past. Most recent was 18 mos ago), Aortic Aneurysm, and
Acid Reflux


Social History:
The patient smokes about 2 pipes/day.  He used to smoke about
[**5-29**] pipes per day before gradually reducing the amount.  He has
been smoking for over 40 years.  Patient denies
alcohol/recreational drug use. The patient is a physicist who
used to work for Crystal System before retiring.  He is
currently separated from his wife.

Pertinent Results:
[**2139-5-19**]: ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2139-5-14**] the rate has
increased. Otherwise, findings are similar.

[**2139-5-19**]: CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT
IMPRESSION:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip
in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.

[**2139-5-19**] CTA ABD & PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No definite evidence of active extravasation to localize the
patient's GI bleeding. Small internal hemorrhoid. Focal area of
increased enhancement in proximal transverse colon at hepatic
flexure is likely from a contracted bowel segment as it is
symmetric.
2.  Asymmetric prostate enhancement with prostatic enlargement.
Correlate with PSA and physical examination.
3.  Diverticulosis without diverticulitis. Cholelithiasis
without
cholecystitis.
4.  Bilateral renal cysts.
5.  Moderate-to-severe atherosclerotic disease in the coronary
arteries and abdominal aorta and major branches.
6.  Sub-4 mm left lower lobe nodule for which follow up in 1
year is only
required if high risk for malignancy, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] society
guidelines

[**2139-5-20**] GI BLEEDING STUDY:
IMPRESSION: Active large bowel GI bleed originating at the
region of the hepatic flexure.

[**2139-5-20**]:
PROCEDURES:
1.  Selective superior mesenteric artery angiogram.
2.  Selective inferior mesenteric artery angiogram.
3.  Superselective contrast injections of second and third order
branches of the middle colic artery.
4.  Superselective injections of the three branches of the
superior mesenteric artery supplying the sigmoid colon.
5.  Sidearm angiogram of the right common femoral artery
bifurcation.
6.  Hemostasis by deployment of 6 French Angio-Seal closure
device.
CONCLUSIONS:
1.  Selective superior mesenteric artery DSA angiogram, inferior
mesenteric DSA angiogram and multiple supraselective DSA
injections of the second and third order branches of the
superior mesenteric artery disclosed no active arterial
bleeding.
2.  Hemostasis by deployment of 6 French Angio-Seal closure
device in the
right common femoral artery.

[**2139-5-22**]: ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Premature ventricular complexes. Non-specific

repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2139-5-19**]
no significant difference.

[**2139-5-22**]: ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Probable left atrial abnormality. Non-diagnostic Q
waves
in leads III and aVF. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2139-5-22**]
ventricular ectopy is absent

[**2139-5-22**]: ECG:
Sinus tachycardia with frequent and multifocal ventricular
premature beats. Non-specific lateral ST-T wave changes.
Compared to tracing #1 ventricular ectopy is seen and lateral ST
segment changes are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.
TRACING #2

[**2139-5-22**]: CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
There are lower lung volumes.  Aside from linear atelectasis in
the left lower lobe, the lungs are clear.  There is no evident
pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Cardiac size is top normal
and stable

[**2139-5-22**]: CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
FINDINGS:  The right IJ line has been removed.  Lung volumes are
slightly low. There is mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary
vascular redistribution.  There is volume loss at both bases,
but no definite infiltrate.

[**2139-5-23**] ECHO:
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2138-10-14**], mild aortic stenosis is seen on the current
study. The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased
slightly. Pulmonary artery systolic pressures have increased.

[**2139-5-23**]: ECG:
Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats. Compared to
tracing #2
the heart rate is slower and lateral ST segment changes are less
prominent. TRACING #3

[**2139-5-24**]: CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
FINDINGS:  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  There
continues to be volume loss/infiltrate in the right lower lobe,
although there has been some interval partial clearing.  Upper
lungs are clear.

[**2139-5-25**]: ECG
Sinus tachycardia with occasional ventricular premature
contractions that are multifocal. Compared to previous tracing
dated [**2139-5-23**], there is no change.

[**2139-5-26**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Collection of extraluminal air and fluid adjacent to the
anastomotic site and extension of fluid from the site to the
pericolic gutter. Findings are concerning for an anastomic leak.
Repeat scanning could be considered after oral contrast has
passed the anastomosis to evaluate for extraluminal contrast.
2.  Cholelithiasis without any evidence of cholecystitis.
3.  Extensive diverticular disease in the rectosigmoid colon.
4.  Air- and fluid-filled distended small bowel consistent with
postoperative
ileus.

[**2139-5-26**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. While oral contrast is yet to reach the ileocolic anastomosis
there has
been an interval increase in the amount of surrounding free
intraperitoneal air and extensive mesenteric free fluid which
raises the concern for anastomotic leak.  Upstream dilatation of
the small bowel seen is relatively uniform throughout and may
reflect postoperative ileus.
2. Moderate hiatal hernia.

[**2139-5-26**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION:  AP chest com
