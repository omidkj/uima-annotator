Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5134**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.


History of Present Illness:
     Patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of CAD s/p MI,
s/p CABG x3-4 and ICD, AF on warfarin, and a 50-pack-years of
smoking (stopped in [**2083**]), who was admitted to the ICU for
continued monitoring after brochoscopy revealed diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage.  Three or four months ago, the patient coughed up
something that in retrospect he believes to have been blood,
though he did not appreciate it at the time.  He did not notice
shortness of breath or any other associated symptoms, even with
exertion.  He continued his normal activity, which involved
exercising one hour (30 minutes cardio, 30 minutes weights) five
times per week without incident.  His cough occurs occasionally,
and is only rarely productive, though he usually swallows
anything he coughs up without spitting it out.  About two months
ago, his wife noticed that he coughed up a "dark clot" and he
began to notice a heaviness in his chest when tired, but did not
follow up.
     Approximately three weeks ago he began to notice worsening
shortness of breath, primarily when walking outside in the cold,
and felt concerned enough to contact his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] in
retrospect, he first noticed this several weeks earlier under
similar circumstances.  He reports some lightheadedness or mild
dizziness concurrent with the onset of shortness of breath, but
denies any other syptoms including chest pain or tightness or
sensory changes. Additionally, he recalls increased work of
breathing when climbing stairs, but no other incidents except
those involving vigorous activity (walking rapidly, shoveling
snow) outside in the cold; in particular, he denies dyspnea at
rest.  After seeing his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was referred to a pulmonolgist
who he saw on [**1-13**].  A CT was ordered and he was sent to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**1-16**], followed by flexible bronchoscopy the next day.
 After repeated BAL revealed increasing blood he was sent to the
MICU for continued observation.
     He denies fever, chills, night sweats, unintentional weight
loss, change in appetite, malaise, fatigue, change in energy
level, recent travel, contact with fresh water or time in
wilderness areas, animal contact beyond his cat, known sick
contacts, tuberculosis exposure, exposure to abestos or inhaled
toxins, arthritis, joint pain, muscle pain, kidney disease, skin
changes or rashes, recent use of medications other than those
listed (with the possible exception of antibiotics),
nitrofurantoin use, immunosuppression, or valvular disease.
.
In the MICU, initial vitals were Temp: 98.3, HR: 62, BP: 100/57,
RR: 18, O2Sat (RA): 96%
Exam notable for diffuse fine crackles and wheezing.
Labs notable for WBC: 3.6, Hgb 10.1, Hct 28.3, ESR 62, CRP 55.1,
Gluc 209.
The pt underwent continuous monitoring and serial CBCs, which
detected a drop in hematocrit from 28.3 to 22.5, at which point
he was transfused with two units of PRBCs, which raised his
hematocrit to 29.7.
Vitals prior to transfer HR: 61, BP 120/56, RR: 17, O2Sat (RA):
94%.
.
Currently, he is afebrile with VSS and is feeling well on the
floor.
.
ROS: As above plus denies headache, vision or other sensory
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, chest pain,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,
melena, hematochezia, dysuria, or hematuria.

Past Medical History:

rarely.  6 cups of coffee a day.  Distant history of marijauna.
Exercised 1 hours five days a week until a month ago.  Regularly
played basketball until [**2114-8-7**].  No special diet, though
he avoids red meat and rarely uses salt.  His most recent travel
was to [**Location (un) 74970**] a year ago.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING/STUDIES/PROCEDURES:
Outside CT: Per IP on [**1-16**] "diffuse bilateral pulmonary ground
glass infiltrates without mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy."
.
CXR ([**1-17**]) : There are no old films available for comparison. A
pacemaker is visualized with leads projecting over the expected
locations of the heart. The heart is mildly enlarged. Sternal
wires and mediastinal clips are seen. There is hazy bilateral
vasculature and some areas of patchy alveolar infiltrate. It is
unclear if this is due to the known alveolar hemorrhage or if
there is an overlying element of fluid overload or infection.
.
IP Operative Report ([**1-17**]): Impression: Blood in the trachea.
Blood diffusely in the bilateral bronchial tree dependently, but
with worsening blood on seserial labage indicative of diffuse
alveolar hemorrage.  Otherwise normal mucosa and airways to
tracheobronchial tree with no evidence of endobronchial lesion.
.
ECG ([**1-19**]): Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay. Intra-atrial
conduction delay. Consider prior inferior myocardial infarction,
although it is non-diagnostic and may be within normal limits.
ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific. Clinical correlation
is suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
Echocardiogram ([**1-20**]):The left atrium is moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall and septum. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic root and ascending aorta are mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aort
