History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 y.o. woman with multiple medical problems who
presents to the MICU with UTI/?urosepsis, and PNA vs CHF.  The
patient resides at [**Hospital3 **] Center and today was
noted to have increased confusion, fevers, decreased SaO2.  Two
weeks ago, pt noted to have influenza B virus for which she was
treated supportively.  She was evaluated by the covering doctor
at [**Hospital 100**] rehab who noted that she was not awake enough to eat
this morning.  He noted fevers despite scheduled tylenol
administration and a cough and increasing congestion.   At
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab, the patient's PE was notable for a temp of 102.8,
a heart rate of 105, and a sat of 80% on 3L which increased to
90% on same.  At this point the decision was made to transfer
the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.

In the ED, the pt was initially afebrile, but tachycardic at a
rate of 105.  Pt was also breathing at a rate of 30 on a NRB
satting at 94%.  Exam was notable for diffuse rhonchi and
decreased breath sounds in the LUL.  CXR was notable for diffuse
PNA.  Labs were notable for WBC=15.4 and worsenening renal
function with creatinine of 1.9 from a baseline level of 1.3.
Pt received albuterol(2) and combivent(1) nebs.  Pt also
received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin.    Pt
dropped her pressure to the 80s systolic and was started on
peripheral levophed.  The patient was intubated and a RIJ was
placed.  The patient was brought to the MICU intubated and
sedated and was therefore not able to provide additional hx.

STUDIES:
========
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2190-3-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Evidence of old left frontal infarct.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-15**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF. Underlying pneumonia cannot be
entirely excluded.

EKG [**2190-3-15**]
Atrial mechanism is unclear. Possibly sinus tachycardia, at rate
102 with left bundle-branch block but cannot exclude slow atrial
flutter, at rate 204 with 2:1 A-V block and slight variability
of A-V conduction. Even atrial fibrillation with high degree A-V
block and junctional pacemaker with left bundle-branch block
conduction cannot be altogether excluded (though much less
likely). Compared to the previous tracing of [**2189-11-3**] at 12:51,
ventricular demand pacing is no longer in evidence. The rhythm
in the former tracing is clearly atrial fibrillation with slower
but variable ventricular response,  at rate 74.
TRACING #1

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-16**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Persistent low position of the endotracheal tube.
2. Improving pulmonary edema with unchanged atelectasis versus
infiltrate in the right lung.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2190-3-16**] at 2:00:00 PM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient XXmmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review due to technical difficulties) of [**2189-10-30**], findings
are similar.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. In the interim, the lung volumes have improved.
2. Slight improvement in the multifocal airspace pneumonic
consolidations particularly in the right mid lung.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-27**]
FINDINGS: A single portable image of the chest was obtained and
compared to the prior examination dated [**2190-3-26**]. Allowing for
slight differences in technique, there is no significant
interval change. There is a right basilar hazy opacity likely
secondary to underlying small effusion. There is a left
retrocardiac opacity again noted likely secondary to underlying
atelectasis and a small to moderate-sized effusion, difficult to
exclude pneumonia. There is persistent perihilar fullness
associated with indistinct bronchopulmonary markings reflecting
underlying pulmonary venous congestion and interstitial edema.
The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. A calcified
tortuous thoracic aorta is noted. The supporting lines are
stable and in satisfactory position.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post placement of a tracheostomy tube in a
satisfactory location.
2. Worsening of effusion on the right side; fluid is now seen in
the right minor fissure.
3. Stable Left pleural effusion.
4. Persistent cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema
indicative of congestive heart failure.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-3-31**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Lung volume along with patient's body habitus and volume
overload might explain the worsening opacification in the left
lower lung. However, there is a definite left pleural effusion.
2. The right minor effusion has resolved.
3. The opacification seen in both lungs could either represent
edema or pneumonia or a combination of both, as well as an
element of volume overload, especially that the azygos vein
today is distended.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-4-1**]
Tracheostomy is at the midline with its tip 6 cm above the
carina. The right pacemaker leads terminate in the right atrium
and right ventricle. There is slight interval worsenin
