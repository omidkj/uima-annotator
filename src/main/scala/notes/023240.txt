VTach

Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male with past medical history
significant for CAD s/p CABG and PCI to LCx, aortic stenosis,
VT/VF arrest s/p ICD and ablation, CHF (EF 20%) s/p BiV pacer,
Afib on coumadin, CRI who was recently discharged [**2141-3-30**] after
admission for VT/VF. During that admission, he coded for
pulseless VT and was transferred to the CCU, had an EP study
with ablation of [**1-13**] of the several VT tracts. After a prolonged
stay in the hospital, he was eventually discharged on mexilitine
and metoprolol for VT, and had not been shocked since [**2141-3-21**],
the AM after his ablation. The patient comes to the ED today
after having 11 episodes of VT at rehab (9 of them this am) and
1 shock this am. The remainder of the episodes of VT were ATPed.
He was given an amiodarone IV bolus and started on a drip prior
to transfer to the ED.

Please see the previous discharge summary for a more detailed
summary of that hospitalization.

In the ED, initial vitals were: BP 126/50, HR 50-60 paced, RR
16, O2 sat 94% 4L. EKG showed a v-paced rhythm at 70 bpm. He had
runs of VT in the ED that were all ATPed. He received 4mg IV
morphine, 4mg IV ondansetron, fentanyl 50mcg x4, metoprolol
2.5mg IV. For increasing HR to 100-110s, he also received 1L NS.
His amiodarone was not continued in the ED.

On arrival to the CCU, patient is hemodynamically stable and
relates a history of lightheadedness and palpitations this
morning, that have now resolved. He also recalls receiving an
ICD shock. However, he is not able to accurately recreate a
timeline of today's events. He currently denies CP, SOB,
diaphoresis, abd pain, diarrhea, fevers, chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient's ICD was interrogated on admission, and showed 2
episodes of VT on [**3-30**] episodes on [**4-2**], the day of
admission. One of the latter episodes was shocked after failed
ATP, although the other episodes were successfully converted
with pacing. He was continued on mexilitine and metoprolol, and
digoxin was held due to concern that it may induce arrhythmia.
He had multiple episodes of VT resulting in multiple ICD shocks,
so he was intubated and sedated for comfort. During the VT
episodes, he received amiodarone 150mg IV x3, and was started on
a drip at 1mg/min. He was also given lidocaine 100mg IV, and
started on a drip at 2mg/min. He continued to have VT and ICD
shocks while intubated/sedated. It was decided with the
attending physisican, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**], and the patient's family to
turn off the ICD and ATP function, and discontinue the
antiarrhythmics, changing the patient to comfort measures only.
He had several self-limited episodes of VT subsequently. Attempt
was made to wean his sedation to see if he may be extubated now
that his ICD was off. However, one of his VT episodes progressed
to VFib and the patient died in no apparent distress.
