Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB/chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2161-1-30**] - CABGx4 on IABP (Left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery, vein->diagonal, vein->obtuse
marginal artery, vein->posterior descending artery). Placement
of IABP.
[**2161-1-29**] - Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
70y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] w/ HTN and prostate cancer presenting with 2 weeks of
progressive SOB and chest tightness with exertion.  Prior to
mid-[**Month (only) 1096**], he was in his USOH and able to participate in
household activities such as grocery shopping and taking out the
trash without difficulty but has since developed progressive DOE
with minimal activity until he was unable to climb the 3 stairs
outside his house today w/out significant shortness of breath
and an associated feeling like he "couldn't expand my chest".
He denies any associated diaphoresis, radiation of the
discomfort, palpatations, N/V, or lightheadedness.  He has had
no recent PND or orthopnea and denies any symptoms when he is at
rest.  He has not had recent infectious symtpoms such as sick
contacts, fever/chills, cough, abdominal pain, rhinorrhea,
dysuria, or diarrhea.  He has never previously had similar
symptoms.  He recently completed a course of XRT for prostatic
carcinoma and is currently on adjuvant lupron.
.
In the ED, he had a low voltage EKG w/out significant ST changes
and was otherwise hemodynamically stable.  His labs were
significant for an elevated troponin to 0.15 and he was started
on a heparin drip after consultation with the cardiology fellow.
 CXR demonstrated mild bilateral effusions that were later
confirmed by CTA which also suggested a diffuse interstitial
process c/w infection vs inflammation.  He was admitted to the
floor for further management of these symptoms.

1. Prostate cancer s/p radiation therapy and lupron
2. Hypertension
3. Facial basal cell carcinoma
4. Glucose intolerance

admit this currently.  Remote tobacco.  No IVDU.

Low voltage diffusely.  Normal axis/intervals.  Isolated Q wave
in V3.  ST flattening laterally.
[**2161-1-28**] CTA
1. Large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left
with diffuse intralobular septal thickening and ground glass
airspace opacities, most consistent with acute congestive heart
failure. An infectious vs inflammatory process would be much
less likely. Prominent mediastinal nodes may also be be seen
with CHF.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
3. Sclerotic lesion within the T10 vertebral body, concerning
for metastatic disease. No definite correlate is identified on
bone scan from [**2160-3-27**] and this may be mew.
4. Enlarged left thyroid lobe with focal area of coarse
calcification within. This may be further evaluated with
ultrasound when appropriate.
5. Dense three-vessel coronary artery calcification.

[**2161-1-29**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system revealed 3
vessel
coroanry artery disease. The LMCA was noted to be heavily
calcified with
distal tapering. The LAD had an ostial 80% lesion with
mid-segment total
occlusion and left to left collaterals. The LCX was a dominant
vessel
with a 90% origin lesion noted to be heavily calcified and a 99%
OM1 and
99% distal LPDA lesion. The RCA was a nondominant vessel with a
100%
mid-segment lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided
filling
pressures. There was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension. The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.82 mL/min/m2.
3. There was no evidence of aortic stenosis on pullback from LV
to
Aorta.
4. Left ventriculography revelead on EF 33% with anterior
hypokinesis.
There was no evidence of mitral regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Referred for CABG evaluation.

[**2161-1-31**] Head CT
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Please note that MRI
with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for the
detection of acute brain ischemia.

NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There appears to be hypodensity
in the left insular cortex and subinsular white matter. This is
new since the CT of [**2158-8-1**], and suggests a subacute infarction
in this region. There is no evidence of hemorrhage. This finding
was discussed with the treating team at 10 am on [**2161-2-1**].

[**2161-2-1**] Head CTA
Filling defect in the M2 segment of the superior division of the
left MCA likely indicating occlusive thrombus. Extensive
calcification of the internal carotids bilaterally with 25%
stenosis of the left ICA bulb. Stenosis of the origin of the
vertebral arteries bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27235**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-1-28**] for further
evaluation of his chest pain. Heparin was started for
anticoagulation. An echocardiogram was performed which showed an
ejection fraction of 30-35%, [**1-28**]+ mitral regurgitation and
global hypokinesis. He was diuresed for congestive heart
failure. On [**2161-1-29**] he underwent a cardiac catheterization which
revealed left main and severe three vessel disease. Given the
severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service was
consulted for surgical revascularization. Mr. [**Known lastname 27235**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. On [**2161-1-30**] Mr. [**Known lastname 27235**]
was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting to four vessels, a left ventricular
branch endarterectomy and placement of an intra-aortic balloon
pump. Please see separate dictated note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He was transfused with packed red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 27235**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
and was extubated. He developed expressive aphasia and a head CT
scan was performed and a neurology consult was obtained. A
filling defect was noted in the middle cerebral artery territory
indicating a cerebral accident and plavix and aspirin were
recommended. No significant carotid disease was identified. The
speech therapy service was consulted and worked with Mr. [**Known lastname 27235**]
daily making excellent progress. His prognosis for improvement
in language therapy was excellent. The physical and occupational
therapy service were consulted for assistance in his care. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. On
postoperative day six, Mr. [**Known lastname 27235**] was transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. He continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative
seven. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], his
primary care physician and the neurology service as an
outpatien
