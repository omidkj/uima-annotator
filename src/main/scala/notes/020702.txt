HISTORY:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 11182**] [**Name2 (NI) **] is a 28 and 0/7 week gestation,
1160 gram female newborn, twin II, who was admitted to the
NICU on [**2158-12-6**], for management of prematurity. She
was born to a 23-year-old, gravida 2, para 0, now 2 mother.
Prenatal screens were as follows: blood type B positive, antibody
screen negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, RPR
nonreactive, rubella immune, GBS unknown. Other screens: GC/
chlamydia negative and HIV negative. The pregnancy was notable
for monochorionic diamniotic twins, preterm labor and pre-
eclampsia. She was Betamethasone complete, with doses on [**12-4**] and [**12-5**]. Also received magnesium sulfate. [**Hospital 37544**]
medical history of depression on no current medications. HPV and
eye surgery now with ocular prosthesis.

The decision was made to deliver twins for worsening pre-
eclampsia. GBS status was unknown. Maternal temperature max 99.7.
Rupture of membranes at time of delivery. Intra-partum
antibiotics begun 2 days prior to delivery.

At delivery, twin II required positive pressure
ventilation and responded well. However, she was intubated in
the delivery room for increased work for breathing and
irregular respirations. Her Apgars were 6 and 8. Her
examination upon admission to the NICU: Weight 1160 grams,
50th percentile. Length 36.5 cm, less than 50th percentile.
Head circumference 25.5 cm, less than 50th percentile. Non
dysmorphic pink. Anterior fontanelle soft, flat. Ears
normally set. Palate intact. Neck supple. Lungs poor aeration
plus deep substernal retraction. Abdomen soft with present
bowel sounds. GU normal pre-term female. Hips stables. Patent
anus. Extremities pink and well perfused. Normal tone and
activity.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Respiratory: She
remained intubated upon admission to the NICU, and was given
Surfactant. She was extubated to CPAP on day of life 2,
which was weaned over the first week of her life, and she
transitioned to nasal cannula oxygen by day of life 12. She
reached room air by 1 month of age (corrected gestational age
of 34 weeks). She did go back on nasal cannula within a few
days, however, where she remained until she came down with
RSV on day of life 54. Due to increased work of breathing,
she was placed back on CPAP until her bronchiolitis improved.
She also completed 7 days of Ampicillin and gentamicin around
the time of her RSV illness for a secondary bacterial
pneumonia on chest x-ray findings, as well as abnormal CBC.
She was on caffeine until day of life 40, and she received
several courses of Lasix for increased oxygen requirement and
edema while she was on nasal cannula. At the time of discharge,
she is comfortably breathing in room air and has been more than 5
days free of any apneas or desaturations.

Cardiovascular: She received one course of Indomethacin for
patent ductus arteriosus noted on exam and echo shortly after
birth. Her murmur resolved thereafter, and on the [**12-13**] (day of life 7) she had an echocardiogram that
showed no PDA). She has been hemodynamically stable with
normal blood pressures and perfusion.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: She was initially on IV
fluids and parenteral nutrition. She had no significant
electrolyte abnormalities. Enteral feedings were advanced
during the first week of life, and she reached full feeds by
day of life 13. She is currently on demand feeds taking ad lib
E20 with minimum set volume of 130 mls/kg/day and gaining weight.
Her discharge weight is 3555 grams. She had phototherapy during
the first week of her life with a peak bilirubin of 5 mg/dL on
day of life 2. Her phototherapy was discontinued on day of life
8. She had a rebound bilirubin of 4.2 on day of life 11. She has
had normal stools and no significant feeding intolerance
throughout her stay.

Hematology: She was transfused on day of life 5 with 10 ml/kg of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 32.9%
in the context of coag negative staph bacteremia. She was
also transfused 20 mls/kg on day of life 45 for a
hematocrit of 21.1%, and increased work of breathing and
problems with oral feeding. The most recent hematocrit is 27%
on the [**11-30**]. She is on iron and vitamin E.

Infectious Disease: She received ampicillin and gentamicin
after birth. These antibiotics were discontinued after 48
hours when her blood culture was negative. Two days later she
had a bilious aspirate and was found to be lethargic, so she
was started on ampicillin and gentamicin again after blood
culture was obtained. Her blood culture grew coag negative
staph. She was changed to Vancomycin and she completed a 7
day course with no subsequent positive blood cultures. She
had a lumbar puncture performed on day of life 10 that was
reassuring. It was 5 white blood cells and 20,600 red blood
cells, with normal protein and glucose. She had increased work of
breathing and oxygen requirement around day of life 54, as
well as nasal congestion. A nasal washing was sent for a
viral panel and returned positive for respiratory syncytial
virus. She was placed on contact precautions, on which she
remained at the time of discharge.

Neurology: She had a normal head ultrasound on the [**12-15**] (day of life 9) and on the [**12-8**] (1 month age).

Sensory: Newborn Hearing screening passed on [**2159-2-17**].

Ophthalmology: She had eye exams on [**1-8**] which was
mature zone 3, and [**1-29**] which showed her retinas to be
mature with a recommended followup in ophthalmology at 9
months after discharge.
