Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
74 yo F h/o Wegeners disease with pulmonary and renal
involvement, most recently course complicated by
tracheobronchial disease in particular bilateral bronchial
stenosis status post balloon dilation with intralesional steroid
therapy by interventional pulmonology with recent increase in
prednisone and addition of azathioprine [**5-11**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] for
maintenance.
.
Patient was doing well until one day prior to transfer when she
developed shortness of breath and some lethargy. The day prior
to admission, her daughter spoke to her on the telephone and
noted dyspnea with speaking. On the evening of [**5-25**] she became
acutely dyspnic with difficulty speaking.  In additiona she had
fever, chills, diffuse myalgias, fatigue and overall weakness.
She called EMS and was taken to the [**Hospital6 28728**] Center
ED.
.
Patient was taken to [**Hospital 1121**] Hospital. In the OSH, initial
vs were: T 98.6 P 136 BP 138/73 R 20 O2 100% on CPAP. Patient
was admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxic respiroty failure.
She was weaned from CPAP to a open face high flow of 70%.  Her
blood gas was 7.29, pCO2 58, pO2 192.  Patient also was
hypotensive on admission and required phenylephrine gtt, which
was weaned off overnight.  Patient underwnet CTA, which was
negative for PE, but showed bilateral pleural effusions and
diffuse bilateral pneumonia.  A 3-D view of her trachea to
evaluate for tracheal stenosis was obtained, but was not read
prior transfer.  Labs were notable to WBC of 24.5 with 50%
bands. No sputum culture was obtained.  OSH team was concerned
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**] (although patient is on PCP prophylaxis at
home) and gave patient full-dose Bactrim.  Patient was checked
for Influenza A and B, which were negative, but was started on
tamiflu.
.
Also, at OSH, patient had an elevated troponin-I at 3.46, which
trended down to 2.72.  EKG showed no ST elevations.  Cardiology
consulted and recommended an ECHO, which showed no obvious wall
motion abnormalities per report.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient reports her dyspnea is
improved from yesterday.  No chest pain, shortness or breath,
diaphroesis.  No fevers, rigors.
.

Chest X-Ray:
Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
Right lower lobe and left lower lobe consolidations are present.
There are also focal
opacities in the right upper lobe and to a lesser extent to left
upper lobe, findings consistent with severe multifocal
infection. Heart size and the mediastinal silhouettes are
unremarkable. Healed fractures with callus
formation are noted on the right. There is no pleural effusion
or
pneumothorax, small amount of pleural effusion cannot be
excluded.

(carinii

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of [**2174-5-30**] 8:46 AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a new left-sided PICC line. The course of the line
is unremarkable. The tip of the line projects over the mid to
low SVC. There is no evidence of
complications, notably no pneumothorax. Borderline size of the
cardiac silhouette. Unchanged signs of overinflation, the
pre-existing areas of parenchymal opacities have decreased in
extent and severity.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2174-5-30**] 1:50 PM
IMPRESSION: Aspiration of thin barium, which did not fully
resolve with chin tuck.

ECG Study Date of [**2174-5-26**]  5:21:30 PM
Normal sinus rhythm with left atrial abnormality. Q waves in III
and aVF consistent with prior inferior myocardial infarction.
Peaked P waves in the inferior leads also suggest right atrial
enlargement. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2174-3-31**] no
diagnostic interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98795**] is a 74 y/o F with a h/o Wegener's who presented in
respiratory distress, found to have multifocal HCAP and E.coli
bacteremia and complicated by NSTEMI/demand ischemia, now
improving.

# Pneumonia/bacteremia:  The patient has a complicated history
of Wegner's with pulmonary involvement, most recently
complicated by bilateral bronchial stenosis status post balloon
dilation with intralesional steroid therapy by IP.  She was also
recently started on high-dose prednisone.  She presented with
fever, respiratory distress, and hypotension and was found to
have bandemia, diff
