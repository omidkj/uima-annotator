[**2159-11-28**]
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm [**Doctor Last Name **] Magna Ease
    aortic valve bioprosthesis (model number 3300TFX, serial
    number [**Serial Number 52716**]).

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52719**] is an 86-year-old female with a history of critical
aortic stenosis, systolic congestive heart failure, and
deconditioning due to arthritis, who presented to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2159-11-17**] with shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. At
the time of presentation she was unable to walk more than 10
feet without dyspnea. These symptoms were suspected to be due a
CHF exacerbation from her critical AS. This was her second CHF
exacerbation with the first being in [**9-/2159**] when she was first
diagnosed with AS. She has never had angina or syncope however
she has had lower energy level for at least a year that she was
not able to explain. At the OSH she was diuresed with IV Lasix.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath and further evaluation of
her severe AF. Of note, she was also complaining of URI symptoms
which resolved during that admission, except for persistent
cough. She did not have any fevers or chills. Cardiac surgery
was consulted for evaluation of operative candidacy for aortic
valve replacement.

IMAGING
==============
Prelim Cath Report [**2159-11-22**]:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated insignificant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
was free
of flow-limiting stenoses.  The LAD had a 50% mid-to-distal
stenosis;
there was also a 50% stenosis at the origin of the diagonal
branch.  The
LCx was free of flow-limiting stenoses.  The large dominant RCA
had a
30-40% stenosis in the proximal portion of the vessel.
2) Supravalvular aortography demonstrated 1+ aortic
regurgitation.  The
sinus of Valsalva width was 25-27mm in diameter.
3) Distal abdominal aortography demonstrated patency of the left
iliac
artery (diameter >7mm) and an accordion effect of the right
iliac
artery, due to vessel tortuosity.
4) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated
left-sided
filling pressures, with a mean wedge pressure of 35 mmHg, and
marked
pulmonary arterial hypertension, with a PA systolic pressure of
75 mmHg
and a mean PA pressure of 49 mmHg.  These findings are
consistent with
aortic stenosis.  There was also marked systemic arterial
hypertension,
with a central aortic pressure of 188/80 mmHg.
5) Estimated cardiac index by Fick principle was normal at
2.4-2.6
l/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical aortic stenosis with markedly-elevated wedge
pressure.
2. Insignificant coronary artery disease.
3. Evaluate for aortic valve replacement surgery.  In the
meantime,
would recommend diuresis and volume status optimization.
.
CT chest w/o contrast [**2159-11-23**]:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate. Left lower lobe
consolidation that potentially may represent atelectasis,
although infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
Neoplasm is substantially less likely, but follow-up in 8 weeks
or comparison with prior studies is recommended.
2. Retrosternal component of large thyroid goiter, approximately
7 cm below the thoracic inlet.
3. Extensive coronary calcifications and aortic valve
calcifications.
4. Compression fracture of lower thoracic vertebral body, most
likely T11.
.
Carotid Doppler [**2159-11-23**]:
Right ICA <40% stenosis.
Left ICA <40% stenosis.
.
Panorex [**2159-11-23**]:
Technically limited film. Questionable slight resorption of bone

surrounding the radix of [**1-10**]. No other evidence of periradicular
granulomas
.

[**2159-11-28**] Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta and complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending
aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace
paravalvular leak is seen. There is trace aortic regurgitation.
There is echodense material around the aortic bioprosthesis
however without blood flow into the echodense space consistent
with normal postoperative changes. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is a very small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade.


IMPRESSION: Normal bioprosthetic valve function. Moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with borderline left
ventricular hypokinesis. Basal to mid septal hypokinesis. Mild
global right ventricular hypokinesis.

In comparison to the post-AVR intra-operative TEE from earlier
today, the findings are similar.
