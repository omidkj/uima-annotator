History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 951**] is a 66 year old female with multiple medical
problems, including COPD (6L home O2), squamous cell laryngeal
cancer (s/p
resection, XRT, and trach), large cell lymphoma,
tracheobronchomalacia, squamous cell lung ca, and hepatitis C
who was in her usual state of health until about a week ago when
she developed the onset of progressive dyspnea. She was using
her albuterol and mucomyst more frequently and also had been
suctioning tannish sputum. She denied fevers or chills, nausea
or vomitting.
.
On day of admission, she was in her bathroom heading out to her
chair when she became unconscious, falling to the floor. Her
roommate heard the crash and called 911. She was found
unresponsive, cyanotic, and diaphoretic. She became responsive
during nebulizer treatment. She is unable to recall this period
until she awoke in the ED.
.
At the ED, she was cultured and started on methylprednisolone
125 mg, and levaquin 500 mg. Combivent was administered x 3. Her
trachea stoma was accessed with a 6.0 trach and she was started
mechanically ventilated. Her initial PH was 7.2 with a pCO2 of
66.

TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Since the previous tracing of [**2168-8-4**]
the rate is more rapid. The electrocardiogram is otherwise,
normal and unchanged.

LENI: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
performed. These show normal compressibility, augmentation, and
Doppler flow and waveforms. No intraluminal thrombus is
identified. IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

AP PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a metallic
tracheostomy tube. Left and right main stem bronchus stents are
seen. There are bilateral lower lobe opacities There are
bilateral interstitial opacities with perihilar fullness. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Mediastinal contour is stable.
IMPRESSION: Perihilar fullness and interstitial opacities
consistent with volume overload/CHF pattern. Bilateral lower
lobe opacities are also present and superimposed infectious
process cannot be excluded.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 951**] is a 68 y.o. woman with unwitnessed loss of
consciousness and evidence of ?PNA vs. CHF on CXR.
*
SYNCOPAL EVENT: The patient's loss of consciousness was
attributed to a hypoxic event from a mucus plug. Her cardiac
enzymes were negative x 3. LENI's were negative making PE less
likely. No V/Q was done because her CXR was poor quality because
of the finding of consolidation vs atelectasis. CTA was not
obtained because the patient has renal failure and PE was not
high on the differential. Echo showed preserved EF and no wall
abnormalities, making a cardiac process unlikely as etiology for
the event. Her telemetry showed no events that might have
indicated a rhythm abnormality.

When the patient was transferred to the medicine service, her
course was complicated by a 38 beat run of NSVT. EP was
consulted and they felt that this was artifact.
*
RESPIRATORY FAILURE: At home, the patient is on 6L of 02 at
baseline. Her failure was thought to be secondary to aspiration
vs. mucus plug in setting of increased secretions likely [**2-23**]
pna. Her trach was changed to an 8 [**Last Name (un) 295**]. She has no teeth so
less likely to have anaerobes. She also is at risk of post
obstructive PNA as she's had lung CA and had bronchial stents
placed. LENI's were negative for DVT making PE less likely. She
was treated with levofloxacin. Her mucomyst was continued
although the patient needs to be educated about reducing the
amount of mu
