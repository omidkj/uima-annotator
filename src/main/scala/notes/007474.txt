Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-19**] Intubation
[**8-22**] Removal of left indwelling line
[**8-22**] Fluoroscopic-guided placement of right midline line
(removed [**8-28**])


History of Present Illness:
38yoF with h/o paranoid schizophrenia, NIDDM, brought in from
Psych facility [**Hospital1 **] for fevers. She was at [**Hospital1 **]
apparently after having downed 2 bottles of Advil and was
cleared from [**Hospital **] Hospital, then transferred to [**Hospital1 **].
She has been seen several times in the ED for self inflicted
laceration to her forehead.

Pt was having neck pain the night before admission and noted to
be febrile. ED vitals: Febrile to 105, 112/66, tachy to 136,
with RR 46 and 99% 2L. Got BCx's, UCx, and LP in the ED which
was normal, CSF pending but unremarkable to date. Got 5-6L NS
and 1g Vanc and 2g CTX. Lactate 2.2, some abnmls of K, Mg, Phos.
WBC count was 13 with neutrophilia and low grade bandemia. Not
in renal failure; LFT's normal. CXR shows RML opacity and a L
sided retained cathter, and R portacath in place.

Was admitted to the floor and given lyte repletion. WBC's rose
to 19.7, now down to 16. Febrile through the afternoon. BCx's
ended up growing 6 bottles of GPC's in pairs and clusters.
Access has been an issue, and despite many attempts, unable to
get peripherals and the only 22g PIV has blown. Continued Vanc
and CTX on the floor but apparently didn't get further IVF's.

She currently feels cold and is anxious. She denies SOB, CP,
palpitations, n/v/abd pain.

Pt also states that she has neck pain on R that started
yesterday, however the 1:1 sitter in the room states she's been
in the ED numerous times recently with neck pain which is
supported by the numerous CT's of her neck. She has been seen
several times in the past couple months for acute on chronic
head laceration from repetitive banging her head.

ROS as above, otherwise negative or unobtainable.

IMAGING:

[**8-19**] CXR:
Right infrahilar opacity is consistent with pneumonia.

[**8-20**] CTA chest:
Abandoned left subclavian catheter terminating at cavoatrial
junction. No
evidence of left subclavian vein thrombosis in the or superior
vena cava /
mediastinitis / mediastinal abscess.

[**8-20**] Liver/gallbladder US:
Normal appearance of the liver parenchyma and gallbladder. No
evidence of acute cholecystitis. No ascites.

[**2187-8-21**] TEE
IMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Normal biventricular function.

[**8-22**]  Fluoro guided placement of R midline, removal of L line
1. Right midline venous catheter placement via the right
brachial vein.
2. Complete, likely chronic, occlusion of the superior vena
cava. The right
port-a-cath was kept in place to preserve access across this
occlusion.
2. Complete removal of left subclavian venous catheter remnant.


Brief Hospital Course:
38yoF with history of paranoid schizophrenia and non-insulin
dependent diabetes admitted from her inpatient psych facility
with fevers to 105 and altered mental status, found to have high
grade MSSA bacteremia/sepsis with retained catheter fragment in
L subclavian.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. MSSA Sepsis:  Fever to 105 on admission with borderline
hypotension and somnolence/altered mental status.  Blood
cultures grew S. aureus within 12 hours of admission, and she
was started on vancomycin.  Potential sources of infection
include the laceration on her forehead or either of her
indwelling lines (left catheter tip did eventually grow S.
aureus).  She was aggressively fluid resuscitated on the floor,
however there were multiple issues with adequate intravenous
access due to poor veins and questionably infected right
port-a-cath with retained line in left subclavian (see below).
She was transferred to the MICU where she was intubated for
procedures,received fluids but not pressors. TTE and TEE did not
show any vegetations. Pt was taken to IR for removal of the L
subclavian line fragment. The R sided indwelling portacath
