PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General appearance - Alert, well
appearing male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat examination - The neck is supple.  There are no
carotid bruits.  The lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally .  The heart is a regular rate and rhythm.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable.  There are no bruits.
Extremity examination - The feet are warm bilaterally.  The
left foot has intact sensation, intact motor and capillary
refill.  The pulses show palpable radials, carotids and
femorals bilaterally two plus.  The right popliteal is
palpable two plus.  The dorsalis pedis is monophasic signal
and the posterior tibial on the right is a triphasic signal.
On the left, the popliteal is Dopplerable signal and the
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial are monophasic signals on
the left foot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
Emergency Department and ultrasound was obtained which showed
a proximal anastomosis graft stenosis.  The patient was
admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 7257**] service, placed on intravenous
Heparinization.  Coagulation studies were monitored and
Heparin dosing adjusted for a partial thromboplastin time of
60 to 80.  The patient was given adequate analgesic control.
Renal was consulted for his history of end stage renal
disease, hemodialysis dependent.  Cardiology was consulted
because of the patient's significant history of cardiac
disease and congestive heart failure and dilated
cardiomyopathy.  The patient was seen by the cardiology
fellow.  The patient had no acute episodes of chest pain or
shortness of breath.  Recommendations were rule the patient
out for acute myocardial infarction, cycle enzymes, continue
Aspirin, Plavix, Labetalol, Lipitor and Heparin drip.  The
patient will be seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist, the
following morning.
Troponin levels were 1.4, 1.5 and 1.3.  The patient ruled out
for acute myocardial infarction secondary to renal failure
and low renal clearance.  On [**2164-1-10**], the patient
underwent exploration of the left external iliac and common
femoral, attempted retrograde recanalization of the left
common femoral stenosis via the left PTFE bypass, puncture
attempt of the right common femoral artery, right common
femoral cut-down and intraoperative angiogram.  The procedure
was aborted secondary to severely calcified vessels which
were not able to be clamped for surgical intervention.  The
patient intraoperatively had ectopy and intraoperative
hypotension requiring inotropic support.  The patient
intraoperatively was given volume and two units of packed red
blood cells and two liters of normal saline.  He had an
estimated blood loss of 700 cc.  An intraoperative
echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20
percent with global hypokinesis spanning the lateral wall.
The patient was begun on Dopamine and he was transferred to
the Surgical Intensive Care Unit intubated for continued
care.  Overnight events included hyperkalemia requiring
intravenous insulin, calcium and D50 with Kayexalate.  There
were no arrhythmias.  The patient was given a dose of
Vancomycin and the Dopamine was weaned off later that
evening.  Hematocrit was 25.6 and he was transfused two more
units of packed red blood cells.  The patient was given
Dilaudid for analgesic control.  Intravenous Heparin was
continued.  Nephrology continued to follow the patient.  The
patient was extubated.  The Heparin drip was discontinued due
to persistent low hematocrit and large retroperitoneal
hematoma. Plavix was begun on postoperative day number three
after Heparin was discontinued.  His Protonix was changed to
Zantac.  Swan was converted to a triple lumen catheter and he
remained in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  Later that day
on [**2164-1-13**], the patient was transferred to the Vascular
Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and care.  He
continued to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist, who
felt it would be alright to transfer the patient to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit on telemetry.  The
retroperitoneal hematoma was diagnosed with CT of the
abdomen.  Heparin was discontinued then.  The patient was
begun on Plavix.  On postoperative day number three, the
resident was called to see the patient for confusion.  A
sitter was requested to help reorient the patient and monitor
his activities.  He remained in the Vascular Intensive Care
Unit.  Postoperative day number six, Zestril 5 mg daily was
begun for a low ejection fraction along with his Labetalol.
Aspirin and Plavix were continued.  Cardiology felt that we
could discontinue telemetry, that the patient's rise in his
troponin levels was secondary to his renal failure and not
acute infarct.  He continued to be followed by the renal
service for hemodialysis.  The patient was transferred to the
regular nursing floor on [**2164-1-17**].  PVRs of the lower
extremity were obtained on [**2164-1-18**].  The foot pressures on
the right were 8 millimeters and on the left 17 millimeters.
On [**2164-1-19**], the patient was begun on Levofloxacin 250 mg
for a total of four doses for a questionable urinary tract
infection.  The patient's groins were without drainage and he
had no rest pain.  His hematocrit stabilized at 35.9.
Consideration for exploration-bifemoral was discussed with
the patient.  He underwent upper arterial studies which were
read as normal.  The patient was discharged in stable
condition. Wounds were clean, dry and intact.  He will follow-
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Wednesday, [**2164-1-25**], for staple
removal.  At that time, further recommendations regarding
surgery will be discussed with the patient and arrangements
made appropriately.
