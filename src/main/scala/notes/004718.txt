Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 32M with idiopathic dilatated CM (EF 20%), afib,
CVA, SDH, and hypothyroidism who is admitted for diuresis and
milrinone.
.
# PUMP: CHF/Dilated Cardiomyopathy: TTE [**8-3**] showed EF 20%,
diagnosed after presenting with Class III CHF symptoms in [**9-27**],
thought to be viral etiology, s/p AICD. He was admitted for a
more robust diuresis after multiple recent admissions with
attempted diuresis.  On admission he appeared volume overloaded,
with lower extremity edema and an S3 heart sound. Beta  blocker
was increased given the arrythmogenic effects of milrinone, and
then milrinone was bolused and continued as a drip. MAP remained
greater than 40.  Furosemide drip was started.  He diuresed ~1 L
daily for two days.  He was discharged on an increased dose of
beta blocker, decreased ACEI, and his previuos outpatient
torsemide dose.
.
# RHYTHM: Chronic atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, diagnosed in
the setting of hyperthyroidism. INR was initially 3.5 on
admission, and coumadin was held until INR fell into the
therapeutic range.  Half-dose (2.5 mg) coumadin was given on
[**12-24**] when INR 2.1, and he was discharged on 5 mg daily with
plans to f/u for repeat INR on [**12-28**].  Metoprolol was increased to
suppress milrinone-induced arrhthmias. Rate was well controlled
on this regimen.
.
# h/o Ventricular Tachycardia: First noted in [**9-27**], had non
sustained 30 second run seen on Holter [**8-29**], s/p syncope from
VT in [**9-1**].  He had an ICD in place and was monitored on
telemetry this admission with no events.

# NEURO: Patient was s/p CVA, SDH, and seizure [**9-2**] on Keppra
for seizure prophylaxis. This medication was continued and there
was no evidence of seizure.
.
# Thyroid dysfunction: Synthroid was continued for
amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism.
.
# Chronic renal insufficiency:  Creatinine was near baseline
1.7-1.8 on admission and improved with diuresis.
