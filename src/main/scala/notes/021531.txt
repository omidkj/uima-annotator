ECG [**2152-10-3**]
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 74. Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Persistent ST-T wave changes
are present in the lateral leads raising a question of
myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.  There
is no interval change.

CXR [**2152-10-3**]
Portable erect radiograph of the chest was obtained. The lungs
are
clear bilaterally with no evidence of consolidation or effusion.
Accounting for patient rotation, the trachea appears midline and
the cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal with evidence of
stable cardiomegaly. Mild mitral annulus calcification is noted.
There is no pneumothorax. Bony structures and soft tissue are
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

EGD [**2152-10-4**]
Findings: Esophagus:
 Mucosa: Tongue of salmon mucosa was seen at GE junction
consistent with known Barrett's.
Stomach:
 Mucosa: Small patchy areas of abnormal mucosa were seen
throughout the whole stomach. These may represent areas of
intestinal metaplasia.
 Protruding Lesions A single 7 mm polyp was found in the fundus
by the GE junction with some slight abnormal mucosa overlying
it.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Other findings: Bile seen in duodenum without any blood.
Impression: Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus consistent with
known Barrett's Abnormal mucosa in the stomach.  [**Month (only) 116**] represent
intestinal metaplasia related to H. pylori.  Polyp in the
fundus.  Bile seen in duodenum without any blood.  Otherwise
normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: No source of the patient's GI bleeding was seen
on EGD.
Patient should have a repeat EGD to assess areas of abnormal
mucosa for biopsy and for follow up of Barrett's esophagus.

Colonoscopy [**2152-10-4**]
Findings:
 Protruding Lesions Several sessile polyps visualized in cecum
randing from 3-4 mm. No bleeding noted from polyps.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple non-bleeding diverticula with large
openings were seen in the sigmoid colon and descending colon.
Diverticulosis appeared to be severe.
 Other Fresh bleeding noted from two
