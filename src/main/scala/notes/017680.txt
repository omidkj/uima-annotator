REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) 412**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 413**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: *7.2 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% to 55% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: *3.9 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
Aorta - Ascending: *3.5 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aorta - Arch: *3.4 cm (nl <= 3.0 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the LAA.
No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No thrombus in the
RAA. No ASD by 2D
or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Normal LV wall
thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Low normal LVEF. [Intrinsic LV
systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Borderline normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Myxomatous
mitral valve leaflets. Partial mitral leaflet flail. No mass or
vegetation on
mitral valve. Mild mitral annular calcification. Moderate
thickening of mitral
valve chordae. No MS. Eccentric MR jet. Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was
passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a
laryngoscope.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is
seen in the
left atrial appendage.
2. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage No atrial
septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF
50-55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
5. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There
are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is
seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
The mitral valve
leaflets are myxomatous. There is partial mitral leaflet flail.
There is
severe prolapse of the anterior leaflet and prolapse of the
posterior
leaflet.No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There
is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. An eccentric jet of
Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitant jet is die\rected
posteriorly.

POST-CPB: On infusions of epinephrine, milrinone and
phenylephrine.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. Trivial
MR with small
perivalvular jet consistent with suture hole, not seen after
protamine
administration. LV systolic function is preserved on inotropic
support. LVEF
is 55%. RV Systolic function was depressed prior to milrinone
administration.
Trace AI. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from MWMC s/p catheterization on
[**2114-6-16**], for mitral valve replacement. He was taken to the OR on
[**2114-6-18**] for MVR (porcine), Maze, and LAA ligation.  Please see
operative report for complete details of procedure.
Post-operatively, he was taken to the CSRU in stable condition.
He was weaned off mechanical ventilation and extubated on the
day of surgery.  He was started on Amiodarone and Lopressor (for
the maze procedure), but was soon noted to have AV dissociation
with a rapid junctional escape rhythm.  The EPS service was
consulted, Amiodarone and lopressor were stopped, and he
returned to NSR.  He has since been back on and again off
Lopressor due to continued episodes of this same AV
dissociation.  He is being anticoagulated for the rhythm issues
(pre-op AFib, post-op heart block, s/p maze).  He has remained
hemodynamically stable throughout, and is ready to be discharged
home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts monitior.  His coumadin will again be
followed by Dr.[**Name (NI) 42421**] office.
