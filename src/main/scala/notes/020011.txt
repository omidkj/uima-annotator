STAT ADDENDUM:

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  PULMONARY:  The patient underwent a CT angiogram on
[**2111-3-18**] to rule out chronic pulmonary emboli given the
results of echocardiogram, see below.  CT angiogram was
negative for pulmonary emboli, did show some improvement in
left sided effusion as well as some chronic atelectasis and
emphysematous changes.  The patient was tried on several
weaning trials on the ventilator prior to discharge.  He was
able to tolerate a pressure support of 5 to 8 for several
hours during the day before being put back to a pressure
support of 12 at night.

2. CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient underwent cardio
echocardiogram to evaluate systolic function given concern
that congestive heart failure might be contributing to
bilateral pleural effusions.  Echocardiogram showed no change
in ejection fraction of greater than 55%.  However, abnormal
septal motion consistent with right ventricular volume and
pressure overload was noted.  The RV was dilated compared to
the prior report on [**2111-1-9**] with increased tricuspid
regurgitation.  The patient was given the results of the
echocardiogram.  The patient was sent for CT angiogram to
rule out a chronic pulmonary emboli as the source of
pulmonary hypertension.  Given a negative CT angiogram, it is
thought that the patient's worsening pulmonary hypertension
and RV dilation might more likely reflect amiodarone toxicity
with resulting pulmonary fibrosis in the intervals since the
last cardiac echocardiogram.  The patient was started on
captopril low dose for concern for congestive heart failure,
but this was discontinued given a normal ejection fraction
and the fact that the patient's blood pressure was not
tolerating additional antihypertensives.  The patient was
started on 80 mg po Lasix qd to keep his ins and outs
relatively equal and to maintain euvolemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Zosyn 4.5 mg intravenous q8h until [**2111-3-28**]
2.  Amikacin 300 mg intravenous q 18 hours until [**2111-3-28**]

7.  Heparin subcutaneous 5000 units subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **]
8.  Peptamen tube feeds at 80 cc per hour per the G tube
9.  Effexor 50 mg per the G tube [**Hospital1 **]
10. Fluconazole 400 mg per the G tube qd until [**2111-4-25**]
11. Nystatin paint to the oral mucosa qid prn thrush
12. Lorazepam 1 to 2 mg intravenous q4h prn agitation
13. Albuterol 6 puffs q4h prn
14. Lasix 80 mg po/per G tube qd
15. Albuterol 6 puffs q4h prn

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient should be weaned from the vent.  He had
tolerated a pressure support of 5 with PEEP of 5 for up to
seven hours during the day and has been rested on a pressure
support of 12 at night.  A right PICC line is in place for
continuation of antibiotics as noted in the discharge
instructions.  A new PICC Line was placed prior to discharge.
The patient should also receive physical therapy while at
rehabilitation.
