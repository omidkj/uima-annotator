Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 55 yoF with h/o cirrhosis secondary to EtOH abuse who
was recently hospitalized in the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU for GI bleed treated
with EGD banding of esophageal varicies, also dx'd with c. diff
colitis at that hospitalization and treated with Flagyl.  Since
discharge diarrhea has continued, amounting to about 1 Liter per
day over past few days.  Pt has had frequent discussions with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7306**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7307**], who states she seemed to be compliant with
the Flagyl.  However, per [**Name (NI) **], pt was recently seen as outpt and
provider who saw her was concerned regarding Ms. [**Known lastname 31956**]'
awareness as to which bottles of medicine she should be taking
since discharge.
.
Per pt diarrhea has been continuous since discharge, no blood or
melena, no nausea or vomitting, no sick contacts.  She denies
fever, chills.  Pt does have a mild abdominal cramping as a band
across lower abdomen - no RUQ pain.  She denies increased abd
girth.

Pertinent Results:
US RUQ: [**2125-1-23**]:
FINDINGS: The gallbladder is decompressed. There is an ovoid
focus of sludge within the lumen. The liver is coarse in
echotexture. No focal lesions are identified. Again demonstrated
is reversal of portal venous flow. Ascites is again identified.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Sludge within the gallbladder. No evidence of cholecystitis.
2. Redemonstration of reversal of portal venous flow.
3. Coarse echogenic liver consistent with cirrhosis.
4. Moderate amount of ascites.
.
[**2125-1-24**]: Abdomen - supine and erect:
FINDINGS: Note is made of diffuse increase in radiodensity of
the abdomen, suggestive of ascites noted on the prior
ultrasound. Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable, without evidence
of significant obstruction. Note is made of normal haustral
pattern in the ascending colon. No evidence of free air is seen.
.
IMPRESSION: Ascites. No evidence of obstruction or dilatation of
the bowel gas.
.
[**2125-1-25**] Liver/GB u/s-Appearances are consistent with hepatopetal
flow secondary to portal hypertension in a cirrhotic liver.
.
[**2125-1-25**]: LENI: No evidence of DVT
.
[**2125-1-30**]: ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis with near akinesis of the septum
and inferior wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion
.

COMPARISON: Reference is made to examination from [**2125-1-25**].
.
REPORT:
Again the liver parenchyma is somewhat coarsened consistent with
cirrhosis. The gallbladder is relaxed, but there is gallbladder
wall thickening and sludge within the gallbladder, both likely
reflecting background chronic liver disease. The patient has
moderate ascites. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
The portal vein is patent, but again demonstrates hepatopetal
flow. This is identified in the anterior branch of the right
portal vein and the left portal vein also. The hepatic veins are
patent and normal waveforms are returned from right middle and
left hepatic veins. The hepatic arteries are similarly patent.
Kidneys are normal size, shape, and echogenicity. Symmetrical
flow is identified to both kidneys. No evidence of renal vein
thrombus identified on either side.
.
CONCLUSION: Cirrhosis with portal hypertension as described. No
evidence of renal or hepatic vein thrombus
.
[**2125-2-6**]: CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. ETT tip too close to the carina. This finding was discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 11:00 a.m.
2. Improved but still suboptimal position of the tip of the left
PICC line.
3. Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia.
4. Increasing pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient continued to have copious
diarrhea of approximately 1L per day. An extensive workup
looking for potential causes of her diarrhea inlcuding:
- stool cultures : these were negative
- paracentesis: negative for SBP, malignancy
- TTG: negative
- C Diff cultures - were negative
- GI service was consulted and followed patient while on floor.
- abdominal imaging including ultrasound and plain films did not
identify any potential causes.
.
Despite an extensive workup, no clear cause of her diarrhea was
identified. She was supported with IVF and electrolyte repletion
while on the floor.
.
On the night of [**1-29**], patient lost all access (had an EJ only),
and was unable to take IVF as per usual.  In the AM, she was
found to be relatively [**Name2 (NI) 24420**] (sbp in the 70's and tachy to
the 115 range) and to have increased o2 requirement (was on 2
lpm, but was 91% on 4 L now on NRB).  She was transferred to the
MICU for central access in the setting of coagulopathy (INR
1.5), the need for closer monitoring of volume status and fluid
repletion, as well as a diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis.
After approximately 1.5L of fluid resuscitation, patient's blood
pressure  returned to SBPs in the 90s.
.
Later in the evening of [**1-30**], she was
