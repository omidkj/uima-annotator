CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 70-year-old female transferred
from an outside hospital with hypoxemia, right pleural
effusion, and mesenteric ischemia with mesenteric vein
thrombosis/portal vein thrombosis.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to the
outside hospital on [**2146-4-7**] with complaints of abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dyspnea for one to two
days at the outside hospital.  The white blood cell count was
24,000.  The abdominal CT showed inflammation, edema of the
entire small bowel and colon, and a thrombus in the
mesenteric vein and portal vein.  SA02 was 87% on room air
which increased to 94% on 7 liters.  ABG on 7 liters of
oxygen showed a pH of 7.36, PC02 31, 02 of 73, anion gap 13.

Chest x-ray showed a right pleural effusion.  The effusion
was tapped; 800 cc was removed and analyzed.  It was
consistent with a transudate.

An echocardiogram was performed which showed an EF of 30% and
global hypokinesis with 2+ MR.  A Swan was performed which
showed PA pressures of 30/10, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 10 with poor wave output.  The blood pressure was
140s-150s/60s-80s which decreased to systolic of 110s/50s
after the use of nitroglycerin past and Natrecor with Lasix.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diverticulitis, status post sigmoid resection in [**2145-3-20**] with a diverting colostomy which was reversed in
[**2145-11-20**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Iron-deficiency anemia.
5.  Glaucoma.
6.  Allergic rhinitis.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Levaquin.
2.  Ceftriaxone.
3.  Flagyl.
4.  Protonix.
5.  Nitroglycerin paste one-half inch every six hours.
6.  Digoxin 0.25 mg IV.
7.  Natrecor.
8.  Heparin GGT.
9.  Morphine.
10. Saline.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Xanax.
2.  Prilosec.
3.  Timolol.
4.  Xalatan eyedrops.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
96.9, pulse 115, regular, blood pressure 112/66, respiratory
rate 16, oxygen saturation 96% on 6 liters nasal cannula.
General:  The patient is anxious.  HEENT:  The pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements were intact.  Neck:  JVP was flat.
Lungs:  Decreased air movement, poor effort.  Cardiovascular:
Tachycardiac but regular.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen:  Distended, diffusely tender to percussion, no
guarding.  Extremities:  There was +3 edema in the lower
thigh.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  The laboratories from the
outside hospital revealed a white count of 25, hematocrit 42,
bicarbonate 21, creatinine 1.3, albumin 1.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was thought to have mesenteric
ischemia secondary to mesenteric vein thrombosis.  CTA of the
abdomen was performed which showed a thrombus in the
mesenteric vein and posterior portal vein.  The patient was
seen by Surgery and Vascular Surgery.  The patient was
started on anticoagulation with a heparin drip.  Lactates
were followed serially as well as serial abdominal
examinations.  The patient's abdominal examination improved
during the hospital course.  Lactate levels remained low,
from 1.0 to 1.4.

After nearly one week of hospitalization, a repeat abdominal
ultrasound was performed to visualize flow.  There was no
evidence of portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis.  The
patient was kept n.p.o. during the hospitalization and given
intravenous fluids.  The patient was also given parental
nutrition.  The patient was also placed on broad spectrum
antibiotics for prophylaxis of infection from enteric
organisms.  She was placed on ampicillin, levofloxacin, and
Flagyl.  The patient completed a 14 day course of these
antibiotics.

The patient had increased oxygen demand on admission.  This
was thought to be related to her CHF.  Based on
echocardiogram that was performed at [**Hospital1 **],
the patient had systolic dysfunction with an EF of 25-30%.
The patient was aggressively diuresed; however, her
respiratory status continued to decline.  The patient became
increasingly hypercarbic.  The patient had increased work of
breathing.  Thoracentesis was performed with removal of
nearly 1 liter.  It was consistent with a transudate.  The
patient was intubated for increased work of breathing and
hypercarbia/respiratory failure.  The patient remained on the
ventilator for three days.  During that time, the patient was
aggressively diuresed.  Initially, she was placed on AC and
gradually transitioned to pressure support and extubated on
first attempt without difficulties.

Soon after intubation, the patient exhibited bronchospasms
with high airway resistance.  She was started on IV steroids.
The patient responded well with increased oxygenation,
decreased hypercarbia, and wheezing.  The patient was
gradually weaned off the steroids during her hospital course
in the Intensive Care Unit.

CONDITION ON TRANSFER:  Good, 98% on room air, no abdominal
pain, tolerating a p.o. diet.
