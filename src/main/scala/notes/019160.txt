Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Mulitple stab wound assault to chest abdomen and extremities
with shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-4-26**] Exploratory lapararotomy, left chest tube insertion,
repair of left diaphragm, pericardial window, exploratory
sternotomy & suture right atrium, irrigation/suture/closure of
multiple complex soft tissue injuries.


History of Present Illness:
16 yo female who was reportedly assaulted with a butcher knife.
She sustained multiple lacerations of the chest, abdomen, back
and extremities. She was taken to an area hospital where she was
intubated. A left chest tube was placed. She was then
transferred  to [**Hospital1 18**] via Med Flight for further care. She was
hypotensive en route to [**Hospital1 18**]; upon arrival during the initial
assessment the FAST suggested fluid in the pericardium but
because of marked obesity and relative stability, there was also
concern for the FAST being a false positive. Fluids were
therefore administered judiciously with a targeted SBP of 80
mmHg and the patient remained stable enough for transport to the
OR. She was brought up to the OR emergently for further
resuscitation, TEE and definitive repair of her injuries.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
(Complete) Done [**2108-4-26**] at 2:31:14 AM      FINAL

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness:  0.8 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  0.8 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  5.6 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension:  3.2 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening:  0.43  >= 0.29
Pericardium - Effusion Size:  0.9 cm

Findings
16 years old with multiple stab wounds, stab wound to the chest.
Cxray with enlarged cardiac shadow. On echo examination there is
0.9cm pericardial effusion around the R artium. On trangastric
view the effusion is around the R and L ventricle and is 2cm in
size with thick echogenic filamentous clot floating in the
pericardial cavity. No tamponade physiology around the atrium
and right ventricle.
Hyperdynamic L ventricle. Rest of the examination within normal
limits.
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. All four pulmonary veins identified
and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and TVI c/w normal LV diastolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. Nl
interventricular septal motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal descending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:


     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. Interventricular septal motion is normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.


CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2108-5-1**] 11:07 AM

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-30**], there is poor
definition of the pulmonary vessels, suggesting some
overhydration. Extensive opacification of the left base is
consistent with some combination of atelectasis, pneumonia, and
pleural effusion. No convincing evidence of pneumothorax at this
time.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service and taken directly to the
operating room for exploration and repair of her injuries.
Thoracics was consulted intraoperatively due to the cardiac
wound. The patient required crystalloids, platelets and multiple
units of packed red cells during the operation. Postoperatively
she was taken to the Trauma ICU where she remained intubated for
several days. She manifested some congestive failure due to her
massive resuscitation that responded to diuresis. She was
eventually weaned and extubated and was transferred to the
regular nursing unit.

Social work was involved; initially providing support to family
during the acute phase and then once patient was extubated the
Center for Violence Prevention and Recovery were consulted.
Patient and her mother were provided with information pertaining
to counseling post hospitalization. Psychiatry was also
consulted for concerns related to later development os PTSD.
Their recommendations at the time were to monitor for signs of
insomnia, agitation and hypervigilance and to prescribe low dose
Ativan prn for this.

She was discharged to home with instructions for follow up. An
appointment had already been made by her mother for outpatient
counseling for the week of discharge.
