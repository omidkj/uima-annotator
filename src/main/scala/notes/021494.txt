History of Present Illness:
This patient 73 year old male followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for his CAD
which is medically managed.  The patient recently had a
prolonged episode of chest pressure lasting throughout the day
that came and went for 5-10 minutes. It went through to the back
on occasion, but was predominantly anterior.  There was no
diaphoresis.  He did not seek medical help.  He saw his PCP and
was subsequently started on Levaquin for a respiratory infection
for which he had had a sputum culture a week or so before.  A
stress echocardiogram on [**2198-3-13**].  The images were suboptimal
and the ECG portion was strongly positive with a 2 mm planar ST
segment depression in leads V4 through V6 and associated ST
segment elevation in aVL and persisted for greater than 10
minutes into ecovery. A cath today reveals 40% LMm99% mid LAD
w/r->L collaterals,70% proximal circumflex into origin of OM1,
60% OM 2 lesion and 80%Mid/70% distal/90%PDA lesions.  He is
admitted for urgent CABG.

Pertinent Results:
[**2198-3-28**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary disease. The
LMCA had a 40% distal lesion. The LAD had a 99% mid-vessel
lesion and the distal vessel filled partially via right to left
collaterals. The LCX had a 70% proximal stenosis extending into
the origin of a high-rising OM1. There was also 60% stenosis in
OM2. The mid RCA had an 80% mid-vessel lesion and a 70% distal
lesion. There was also a 90% stenosis in an early rising PDA. 2.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.
.
[**2198-3-28**] Carotid U/S: 40-59% stenosis in the right internal
carotid artery and less than 40% stenosis in the left internal
carotid artery.
.
[**2198-3-29**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient is on
no inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. Mitral
regurgitation is unchanged.Tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged.
The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

[**2198-4-4**]: Echocardiogram: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The number of aortic
valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CXR: [**2198-4-7**]: left-sided pleural effusion is virtually
unchanged. There is unchanged evidence of a retrocardiac
atelectasis. Moderate cardiomegaly without acute pulmonary
edema. Unchanged appearance of the sternal wires.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 11482**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a cardiac cath on
[**3-28**] which revealed severe coronary artery disease and he was
admitted for surgical work-up for pending bypass surgery.

On [**3-29**] he was brought to the Operating Room where he [**Month/Day (4) 1834**]
coronary artery bypass graft x 5. Please see operative report
for surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition.  His
chest tubes and cardiac pacing wires were removed per protocol.

Respiratory: extubated on POD2 secondary to anxiety. Aggressive
pulmonary toilet, nebs and his inhalers were restarted.  He
titrated off oxygen with room air saturations of 98%. The left
lower lobe effusion improved.

Cardiac: episode of atrial fibrillation on [**2198-4-4**] which he
converted to sinus rhythm with IV beta-blockers.  Echocardiogram
was done and revealed a trivial physiologic pericardial
effusion. EF normal. His cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended
Carvedilol 50 mg QAM and 25 mg QPM on discharge.

Heme: warfarin was started [**2198-4-4**]. On discharge his INR was 1.9
he was given 2.5 mg of warfarin. Next INR Monday [**4-9**] and
follow-up with his cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Warfarin doses: [**4-6**]
5 mg (INR 1.6), [**4-5**] 5 mg (INR 1.4) [**4-4**] 5 mg.

GI: Abdominal distention with RUQ tenderness was noted which
improved once bowel function return. He tolerated a regular
diet.

Renal: volume overload. gently diuresed.  His Foley was replaced
for urinary retention. Flomax was started. Renal function normal
with good urine output. His electrolytes were replete as needed

Wound: Left lower extremity cellulitis at VasoView site. 7 Day
course of Levofloxacin was started.  Sternal incision with small
area of drainage DSD with Betadine swab was initiated.  He will
follow-up as an outpatient in the wound clinic next week.

Pain: well controlled with narcotics. Neuro: non-focal.

Disposition: he was se
