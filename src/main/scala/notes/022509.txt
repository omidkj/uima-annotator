Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9454**]
Chief Complaint:
foot pain, fevers, sepsis, cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Chief complaint: Transferred from [**Hospital3 417**] for management
of acute on chronic congestive heart failure.
.
History of present illness: Mrs. [**Known lastname 19688**] is a 76 year-old
Portuguese-speaking woman with insulin dependent diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular disease (with stroke), COPD,
depression, GERD, heart failure (LVEF 20%) and chronic renal
failure presenting to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with generalized
weakness, possible abdominal pain, and leg and right foot pain.
Today she is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of fluid
overload.
.
The discharge summary from [**Hospital3 417**] mentions that she was
suffering from gout with treatment begun in the nursing home,
abdominal CT to assess ?abdominal pain, and generalized
weakness. She had also presented with a creatinine of 2.2 and it
appears that fluid resuscitation was commenced that has now
reduced her creatinine but worsened her heart failure. In her
summary, lower extremity pain was attributed to vascular disease
and possibly in need of vascular studies and intervention. She
is also to be worked-up for acute causes of heart failure. CT
scan of the right kidney is suggestive of pyelonephritis that
has so far been treated with Levaquin (renal dosing). While
in-house at [**Hospital3 **]. one blood culture bottle was positive for
staphlococcus but this was atributed to contamination. Another
set from [**2129-8-17**] was negative at the time of transfer. CXR was
suspicious for infiltration of the lower lobes.
.
Per the patient: There was no joint tap to diagnose gout. OSH
records state that she was given allopurinol two weeks ago in
the nursing home for suspected gout along with colchicine
(unclear if renally dosed). She is mostly concerned for the pain
in her right foot which is the reason she gave for her admission
to [**Hospital3 417**]. She says that it had become painful in the
nursing home and that she could no longer stand on it. She has
trouble walking due to her left hemiparesis, and now with foot
and bilateral leg pain.

0/10
Gen: Resting awake and comfortably. Very pleasant and grateful.
Some poverty of spontaneous speech and movement.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

Neck: Supple with JVP to the angle of the mandible at 60
degrees.
CV: RRR with occasional ectopy, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No
thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
Chest: No chest wall deformities. Resp were unlabored, no
accessory muscle use. Crackles worse on the right base. No
wheezes or rhonchi. Patient could not sit so listened to
posterolateral lung. Patient had some difficulty following
instructions for breathing during examination.
Abd: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness.
Ext: [**1-11**]+ edema of the extremities. No clubbing.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses: Edema was severe limiting examination.
Neurological: Left hemiparesis of leg, arm, face, with an upper
motor neuron pattern of weakness. Speech was not dysarthric,
slightly slowed, little spontaneous expression or speech.
Possibly some limitation of comprehension but English is second
to Portuguese. Sensation intact at extremities, forearm and
lower legs. Some degree of pain asymbolia possible - said
touching feet very painful but seemed blase. Reflexes not
tested. Unable to walk.


Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
.
[**2129-9-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Minimal pulmonary edema in the presence
of mild cardiomegaly. No new consolidation.
.
[**2129-9-5**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of vegetation or abscess. Severe global
LV hypokinesis. The lateral wall has relatively better function.
The ventricle appears dyssynchronous. Moderate mitral, aortic
and tricuspid regurgitation (all may be UNDERestimated due to
acoustic shadowing from widespread calcification). Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-8-22**],
overall ejection fraction is probably slightly less. Degree of
aortic regurgitation has increased, degrees of mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation probably similar. Estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures are higher.
.
[**2129-9-3**] CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
CHEST:
Trace pleural fluid is present bilaterally with minimal
dependent bibasilar atelectasis. Images are somewhat degraded
due to respiratory motion artifact; however, there is no
consolidation. Small amount of fluid is present in the dependent
portion of the central trachea. Cardiomegaly and heavy coronary
arterial calcifications and atherosclerotic calcification of the
thoracic aorta is unchanged. There is no mediastinal or axillary
lymphadenopathy. Median sternotomy wires
are in place.
.
ABDOMEN:
The liver, spleen, adrenals, and kidneys are within normal
limits. Numerous surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa and at
the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe from previous
cholecystectomy are again seen. There is no biliary ductal
dilatation. The pancreas is within normal limits. There is
diffuse atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta,
aortic branches, and intrarenal vascular calcifications are
noted. Right femoropopliteal arterial graft is again noted.
There are no peritoneal fluid collections. There is a large
amount of stool in the rectum, descending colon, and distal
transverse colon. There is no small- bowel obstruction. A normal
appendix is noted. There is no bowel wall thickening or
pneumatosis.
.
PELVIS:
The urinary bladder is collapsed about a Foley catheter balloon.
Focus of air in the nondependent portion of the bl
