History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87468**] is a 53 y.o. F with a history of alcoholic
[**Known lastname 87469**] admitted from OSH for epidural hematoma vs abscess.
Around 10 days ago, pt was in the garden weeding when her foot
fell into a ditch. She then fell on her buttox. Ever since the
fall, she has had increasing pain in her neck, along her
vertebrae, shoulders, and bilateral groin. She also reports
episodic numbness and motor weakness in her lower and upper
extremities. Pts symptoms have gotten progressively worse over
the last 10 days. [**Name (NI) 1094**] husband reports that patient has become
more somnolent and confused lately and sleeps often. Sleepiness
has been getting progressively worse. Denies any incontinence,
no vision changes, no abnormal headaches (gets headaches at
baseline). Went to OSH where she was imaged and found to have a
large epidural hematoma vs abscess. She was treated empirically
with vancomycin/ceftriaxone and flagyl. Pt was tranfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further workup. She was found to have an elevated INR
1.7, given vit K and 2 [**Location 16678**].

Pertinent Results:
[**9-16**] MRI L spine:
1. Large posterior epidural collection compressing the spinal
cord from C2 to
T1 and from T2 to T6. The collection persists at the T1 and T2
levels, but
causes less severe mass effect. This could represent either an
epidural
hematoma or an epidural infection. While evaluation is somewhat
limited
without contrast-enhanced images, either a hematoma or an
abscess could show
rim enhancement. There is no evidence of osteomyelitis, but
interspinous
edema is present at C7-T1.
2. Cervical spondylosis, better evaluated on the prior cervical
spine MRI.
3. Mild lumbar spondylosis.
4. Nodular liver, trace ascites, and splenomegaly, suggestive of
cirrhosis and
portal hypertension.

[**2183-9-25**] MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Since the previous study there is now more fluid identified
at the
laminectomy site and posteriorly in the cervical and upper
thoracic region
adjacent to the spinous processes with foci of low signal likely
due to air within it. This could be postoperative in nature but
clinical correlation recommended to exclude infection in this
fluid.
2. Enhancement and thin rim of fluid collection posterior to the
spinal cord from C4-C7 and T1 level unchanged from previous MRI.

3. No evidence of prevertebral abscess or abnormal signal within
the spinal
cord.

[**2183-9-19**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Bilateral asymmetrical airspace pattern in the mid and
lower lungs
is more severe on the left than the right, similar to the most
recent prior
radiograph. However, on an earlier radiograph of [**9-18**] at 3
a.m., the
right side was more affected than the left. Considering the
shifting
distribution and concurrent cardiac enlargement, widening of
vascular pedicle
and vascular engorgement, this probably reflects asymmetrical
pulmonary edema.
Recurrent aspiration is an additional diagnostic consideration
for the
lung findings. Moderate left pleural effusion and probable small
right
pleural effusion are not appreciably changed.

CXR [**9-27**]:
Cardiac size is top normal. Diffuse lung consolidations worse in
the left mid
lung are grossly unchanged. There are no new lung abnormalities
or
pneumothorax. There are no large pleural effusions.

[**2183-9-17**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is a mild resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
systolic function with resting left ventricular outflow tract
gradient (may be related to resting tachycardia). No
echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

[**2183-9-30**] U/S abd:
IMPRESSION:
Moderate ascites.
Patent main portal vein with reversed flow.
Splenomegaly (17.7 cm).
Small right pleural effusion.
