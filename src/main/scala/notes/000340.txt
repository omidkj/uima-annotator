[**Doctor First Name 233**] Ciel, albuterol, nitroglycerin p.r.n., and Plavix.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This gentleman was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit directly after presenting at [**Hospital **] Hospital with
severe chest pain.  He had ultimately ruled in for a
myocardial infarction and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for management.  He was followed
closely by the Cardiology Service in preparation for cardiac
catheterization.

On [**2-27**], his laboratories were as follows:  White blood
cell count of 9.7, hematocrit of 30.2, platelet count of
257,000.  Sodium of 145, potassium of 3.3, chloride of 102,
bicarbonate of 29, blood urea nitrogen of 39, creatinine
of 2.8 (which was near his baseline of middle 2s), and a
blood sugar of 93.  His PT was 13.4, with an INR of 1.3, and
a PTT of 56.8.  He had an abnormal electrocardiogram on
admission with ST depressions throughout multiple leads.

He was maintained in the Coronary Care Unit on a heparin drip
and on a nitroglycerin drip; and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (his cardiologist)
referred the patient to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient was
ultimately seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].

His cardiac catheterization showed an output of 4.3, with an
index of 2.5, a 90% left anterior descending artery lesion at
the diagonal, a 95% circumflex lesion that was distally
occluded 100%, and a 60% distal right coronary artery lesion.
It also demonstrated severe iliac disease.  The patient was
also maintained on his beta blocker and remained in the
Coronary Care Unit.  The patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 27, status post
catheterization.  He had some slight episodes of chest
pressure that resolved spontaneously with no
electrocardiogram changes.  One day preoperatively, his
creatinine dropped from 2.8 to 2.4.  His white blood cell
count remained stable at 8.8, and his enzymes continued to be
cycled.  His Plavix was discontinued in preparation for his
bypass surgery.

On [**3-1**], he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**], off pump, with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending artery, a vein graft
to the posterior descending artery, and a vein graft to the
obtuse marginal.  He was transferred to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

Of note, also, vascular report for noninvasive carotid
studies showed no significant studies on either right or left
carotid arteries preoperatively.

On postoperative day one, he was transfused 3 units of packed
red blood cells.  He was on an insulin drop at 2.5, and his
Neo-Synephrine was slowly weaned off.  He was hemodynamically
stable with a blood pressure of 118/49 and in normal sinus
rhythm at 79.  His lungs were clear bilaterally.  His sternum
was stable.  His incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  His
white blood cell count rose to 23.3.  Sodium of 140,
potassium of 4.8, chloride of 111, bicarbonate of 20, blood
urea nitrogen 27, creatinine of 2.  Neurologically, he was
intact.  He was followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Cardiology.  His ACE
inhibitor was held for the time being while his creatinine
was elevated.

On postoperative day one, in the evening, he had a CT-guided
left pleural space hematoma drained with a pigtail catheter
with no residual pneumothorax.  A portable transthoracic
echocardiogram study was done that evening which showed that
the ejection fraction was mildly depressed at 30% to 40%, but
no significant pericardial effusion was seen.  Please refer
to the final report.

On postoperative day two, the patient was confused overnight.
He was on a dobutamine drip at 2.5 and an insulin drip at 2.
He was in the 80s, in sinus rhythm with a good blood pressure
with mixed venous of 63%.  His index was 2.39 on dobutamine.
His white blood cell count remained elevated at 20.2.  His
creatinine rose again to 2.5, with bicarbonate also depressed
at 17.  His sternum was stable.  His incisions were clean,
dry, and intact.  His abdomen was mildly distended.  The
patient continued to be confused.  He was started back on his
amiodarone, Plavix, and aspirin as his dobutamine was weaned.
He was seen by Case Management.  He had some postoperative
atrial fibrillation with some broad complex tachycardia that
paroxysmal and then converted back to a narrow complex in
atrial fibrillation, with a ventricular rate of about 90 to
100.  He was already on intravenous amiodarone.

On postoperative day three, he had a decreased cardiac index,
so his dobutamine was increased.  He also started Levaquin
for his pulmonary status.  He was awake.  His lungs had
coarse breath sounds.  His incisions were otherwise clean,
dry, and intact.  He remained n.p.o.   His dobutamine was
dropped back down to 2.5.  He was in atrial fibrillation in
the 90s, with a blood pressure of 126/57, a temperature
maximum of 100.6.  In the morning, he was on amiodarone
at 0.5, dobutamine at 5 (which was later weaned down),
nitroglycerin at 1.5, and insulin at 3.  His lactate was 2.
His white blood cell count dropped to 14.6, and his
creatinine rose from 2.5 to 2.7.  He remained in the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

A Pulmonary consultation was obtained given his asthma, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer, and
his somewhat declining respiratory status.  His chest CT
showed an interstitial pattern consistent with pulmonary
edema and a patchy right upper lobe infiltrate.  A small
right pleural effusion, a small medial left pleural effusion,
with two loculated anterior superior effusions, and a
question of tracheomalacia.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of Pulmonary saw the
patient and recommended continuing his nebulizers and given
him some Solu-Medrol, as well as continuing his antibiotics
of Levaquin, and pulmonary toilet.  He recommended diuresing
him as he was hemodynamically able to tolerate.

He was seen daily by Cardiology and Pulmonary who continued
to follow his respiratory status.

On postoperative day four, he was in atrial fibrillation in
the 90s, remained on dobutamine at 5, nitroglycerin at 5,
insulin at 3, as well as his anticoagulation, antibiotics,
and steroids.  His white blood cell count rose slightly
to 15.3.  His hematocrit dropped to 25.7.  His lactate
leveled out at 1.7, and his creatinine rose slightly to 2.8.
His mixed venous was 47%.  Sputum which had been sent off
showed some gram-negative rods in the stain.  He continued
with pulmonary toilet.  His pulmonary artery catheter
remained in place, and he continued on his antibiotics and
steroids.  A digoxin level was a
