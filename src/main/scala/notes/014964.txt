Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sotalol / Lidocaine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, Bilateral arm pain and palpitations


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripheral arterial Catheterization
Left brachial artery exploration and thrombus removal
Left Lung thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year old female who presented to an outside
hospital on [**2131-11-10**] with complaints of feeling her heart
racing and pain running down both arms for about 1-2 hours prior
to admission. She had associated nausea and vomiting at that
time, and mild shortness of breath. She denied any chest pain,
fevers, chills, back pain, abdominal pain, or diaphoresis. Her
son had called 911 and en route to the hospital, she was given
sublingual nitroglycerine x1 with good effect. Upon arrival to
the emergency room she was found to be in atrial fibbrilation
with rapid ventricular response to 153bpm. EKG was reported to
have no ST segment elevations, but was notable for ST segment
changes consistant with digitalis in the inferior leads.
Patient's chest X-ray showed increased vascular markings
consistant with congestive heart failure. She was given 325mg of
ASA and dosed with Cardizem drip. Total CK was normal at 25,
Troponin I of 0.1, BNP of 647. She was started on a heparin drip
and admitted.

During her admission, she developed some ST elevation which was
thought to be related to demand ischemia. Her heart rate was
well controlled on the Cardizem drip and she was loaded with
digoxin. On [**11-12**] she developed a white count of 22.5k and
worsening renal function (Creat 0.8->2.1), and steadly
increasing tropoins (0.1 -> 1.75 -> 2.37 -> 2.53). Urinalysis
showed brown granular casts with + blood, 10-25 WBCs and 2+
bacteria for which she was given one dose of Levoquin 500mg on
day of transfer. Echocardiogram showed an EF of 20% with all
segments being akinetic except the base and inferior-lateral
wall. She had a normal ECHO on [**2129-4-1**].  On day prior to
admission at [**Hospital1 18**], patient was developing worsening renal
failure, increasing O2 requirement, and impression was for
cardiogenic shock.  She was started on dopamine and transfered
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of her condition on [**2131-11-12**].
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

Social History:
Patient is a widowed female who lives with her son [**Name (NI) **]. She is
capiable of performing her ADL at home.  Social history is
significant for the absence of current tobacco use (quit 10
years ago). She drinks 8-10 beers per day.

Family History:
Her father had a history of heart disease that started in his
60s of unknown eitology. Her mother had CAD in her 70s and
survived until her 90s.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2131-11-12**]:
1. Severely depressed left ventricular systolic function
consistent with Takotsubo type of cardiomyopathy with severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the mid to apical left ventricle.
Elevated filling pressures.
2. Apical thrombus maybe present.
3. Apical to mid severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the RV.
4. Small to moderate anterior echodense pericardial effusion.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.
5. Mild to moderate MR.
6. Moderate TR.
7. Moderate elevations of estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

ECHO [**2131-11-14**]:
The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the distal half of the inferior wall, septum
and anterior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and akinetic.
The basal segments contract best (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is focal akinesis of the apical
half of the free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-11-12**],
the severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are now
reduced. Biventricular systolic function is similar. These
findings are most c/w coronary artery disease (mid-LAD
infarction).
The previously noted pericardial effusion is likely epicardial
fat. No intraventricular thrombus is seen on review of the prior
study.

ECHO [**2131-11-27**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an echo dense
mass adherent to the apical visceral pericardium that may
represent hematoma (was not apparent in the prior study). There
is a small pericardial effusion. The pericardium may be
thickened. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-11-14**],
left ventricular systolic function appears markedly improved
(consistent with possible stress induced (Takotsubo)
cardiomyopathy). Tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now much higher
(raising concern for a possible intercurrent process such as
pulmonary embolus).

CTA [**2131-12-2**]:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar
atelectasis.
3.  [**Hospital1 **]-apical scarring.
4.  5-mm right lung nodule which
