Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity claudication and intermittent rest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral to below knee popliteal artery bypass with GSV


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 79 year old gentleman with extensive peripheral
vascular disease with history noted for distant aorto-bifemoral
bypass graft now presenting with increased claudication symptoms
in his right lower extremity as well as intermittent rest pain.
He recently underwent a CT scan with demonstrated his graft to
be patent, but with complete occlusion of his right SFA with
reconstitution of the distal popliteal artery; his left SFA was
found to also be severely diseased. He therefore presents for
elective right femoral to popliteal artery bypass.

Imaging:
[**2146-1-4**]: CXR: Interval development of mild asymmetric
interstitial pulmonary edema.
[**2146-1-5**]: TTE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
to mid inferior and inferolateral walls. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 45 %). The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2146-1-9**]: CXR: mild interstitial edema. More focal opacity at the

left base with associated layering fluid is seen suggestive of
compressive
atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service on
[**2146-1-4**] and had undergone appropriate pre-operative evaluation
for an elective right femoral to below knee popliteal bypass
with saphenous vein graft. The patient's immediate hospital
course was complicated by frequent, intermittent episodes of
angina on HD#1, POD#0. Cardiology was initially consulted, with
no attempt at catheterization given that his cardiac bypass
grafts had stenosed according to catheterization report in [**2141**].
The patient also demonstrated an increased oxygen requirement
while on the floor, and was transferred to the CVICU on POD#1
for aggressive diuresis, close monitoring and pulmonary toilet.
Once stable the patient was transferred to the unit on POD#3
with continued physical therapy, chest physiotherapy, and
titration with beta-blockade and isosorbide nitrate. During the
next few days of his admission, he was weaned off of nebulizing
treatments, transitioned to inhalers and his cardiovascular
medications titrated appropriately. By system,

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid IV with
good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: As noted above, the patient experienced increased episodes
of angina not dissimilar to his episodes at home. The patient
stated he could have 'a few' episodes of chest pain per day,
always relieved by SL nitroglyerin or with time.  During this
admission, the patient was noted to have chest pain with
increased anxiety or with mild exertion. Given his history (CABG
x3, catheterization upwards of 4 years ago demonstrating
stenosed bypass grafts), cardiology was consulted for
recommendations on further management. The initial thought was
for catheterization with potential intervention, and so the
patient was placed on heparin drip on POD#0. This plan was
abandoned the next day, with the decision to pursue conservative
medical management and up-titrate his beta-blockade and
isosorbide nitrate.
An intial set of troponins and CK fractions were negative, and
the second set showed 0.6-0.8-.13-.13 which was likely secondary
to demand ischemia. The patient was continued on his increased
Toprol XL dose of 300mg once daily, imdur 30mg [**Hospital1 **], ranolazine
500mg [**Hospital1 **] and po furosemide 20mg once daily with marked decrease
in symptoms to about 1-3 episodes per day. He did not require SL
nitroglycerin prior to discharge, and his heart rate remained
consistent in the 70-80 range, SBP stable at 110s-120s mmHg.

Pulmonary: The patient is known to have significant history of
COPD, but does not require additional oxygen at home. As noted
above during this admission, the patient demonstrated
de-saturations to the low 80s despite being on face-mask with
increasing oxygen requirement. Given his worsening respiratory
status, he was transferred overnight on HD#1 to the CVICU for
closer monitoring. He was aggressively diuresed as he had
received one unit of blood and close to 5 liters of crystalloid
intraoperatively. His oxygen saturations improved, and his UOP
was well maintained and monitored with foley catheter in place.
Once achieving O2sats at 95-100% on 5lNC, the patient was
subsequently transferred from the CVICU to the floor on POD#3
and continued to have standing nebulizer treatments, chest
physiotherapy, and continuous O2 monitoring. He was resumed on
his spiriva inhaler, and advair was also implemented with good
effect. He did not require standing nebulizer treatments and was
attaining O2saturations in the low 90s to mid 90s prior to
discharge without O2 requirement. He may benefit from
intermittent O2 by nasal cannula (at most at 2L) while at his
rehabilitation facility.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced on P
