CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old man s/p cardiac surgery
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pneumothorax s/p chest tube removal
HISTORY: Status post chest tube removal, to evaluate for
pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-14**], the tubes have
all been removed. There is no evidence for pneumothorax. Mild
atelectatic changes persist at the left base.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No spontaneous
echo contrast in the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire
is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No spontaneous echo
contrast in the RAA. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity. Mild global LV hypokinesis. False LV tendon (normal
variant). Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Dilated sinuses of
Valsalva. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Mildly dilated
aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. No masses or vegetations on
aortic valve. No AS. Severe (4+) AR. Eccentric AR jet directed
toward the anterior mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR. Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. There is a thebesian valve seen at the entrance to the
coronary sinus.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is mild global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
sinuses of Valsalva are dilated. There is effacement of the
sinotubular junction. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated.
7. The aortic valve is bicuspid. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet.
8. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. Well-seated homograft in
the aortic position with normal leaflet excursion. No AI. Small
hematoma at proximal end of homograft at [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of neoaorta.
Distal anastomosis has normal contour. LVEF 45%.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
