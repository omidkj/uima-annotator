History of Present Illness:
71 y/o M h/o HTN, CAD, NIDD, pacemaker/defibrillator, CABG in
[**2086**] who presents after receiving multiple shocks from
pacer/AICD. Pt had CABG in [**2086**] at [**Hospital1 112**]. [**2098**] experienced
episodes of falling asleep constantly and had an accident while
driving which prompted placement of pacer/AICD (unclear medical
reasons per pt and wife). in [**2103**] experienced 1 shock without
subsequent issues.
.
This evening, pt was sitting at home watching tv this evening
when he experienced the first shock. Prior to this he felt fine
only c/o some dizzy episodes earlier in the day but did not lose
consciousness and went about his normal activities without issue
including driving. He denies having SOB/CP, f/n/v. No recent med
changes, or illness. Wife was with pt, they state that he
recieved his second shock 3 minutes later. Per wife, pt received
a total of 10 shocks between those at home and the shocks that
occurred subsequently in the ambulance on the way to [**Hospital 39437**].
.
On arrival to the [**Name (NI) 26615**] [**Name (NI) **] pt had multiple episodes of VT
which were successfully defibrillated by the pts own
defibrillator. BP 156/82, went down to 137/78, HR 80, RR 18,
O2sat 99%. Initially given amio 150mg followed by infusion.
Episodes increased in frequency, received lido bolus 200mg and
drip initiated at 3mg/min with some improvement but again
increased frequency. Defibrillator was not going off so required
ED defibrillation. Twice defibrillated into Vfib which appeared
as polymorphic VT/torsades for roughly 10 seconds, at which
point internal defibrillator fired and pt converted to sinus
rhythm. received another bolus of lido 100mg and drip increased
to 4mg/min. Received oral K 40meq and drip of 10meq/hr along
with Mg 1g IV. Labs at OSH notable for WBC of 11.5, PLT 128, 20%
monocytes 70% PMNs.  K was 3.1 with BUN/cr 32/1.3. CK 103 CKMB
4.1, trop <0.03
.
IN [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **] Pt was in VT with HR in 160s, received 20mg bolus
procainamide. Trop 0.07, K 4.3, Cr 1.3 WBC 12.3. Was in VT with
rate around 160s. ------------------

.
On the floor, pt very sleepy after receiving fentanyl at OSH.
Other than some nausea pt has no complaints. Continued on
procainamide drip at 4mcg/min. EP following, pt now being
A-paced and is in sinus. Pt received a total of 40 shocks this
evening.

[**2106-1-11**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior wall and hypokinesis
of the inferolateral and inferoseptal walls. The remaining
segments contract normally, though technical quality is
suboptimal (LVEF = 40%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta and aortic arch are
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity
dilation with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (PDA
distribution). Dilated thoracic aorta.

[**2106-1-10**] CXR
IMPRESSION:

1. Dual-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with its leads intact
and
terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and
right ventricle
respectively. Status post median sternotomy for CABG with
overall stable
post-operative contours. Interval resolution of the pulmonary
edema with
persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm of uncertain
etiology. Linear
opacity in the left mid lung is felt to most likely represent
subsegmental
atelectasis or scarring. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.



Brief Hospital Course:

placement [**2098**] presents after receiving multiple recurrent
shocks from his AICD this evening. Found to be in persistent VT,
pt stable throughout, received amio, lido, on procainamide with
return of sinus rhythm.
.
#VT - pt with persistent VT resulting in approximately 42 shocks
from both implanted ICD and external defibrillation within a
24-48 hour period. Most likely [**1-21**] pri
