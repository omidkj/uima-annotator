Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10842**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia, Asystole

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiopulmonary resucitation
Intubation
Temporary pacing wire

History of Present Illness:
78y F Cantonese-speaking only with h/o afib on [**First Name3 (LF) 197**], CAD s/p

CABGx2 [**7-19**], and diastolic CHF LVEF >55% presents with abdominal
pain in ED.  While in ED, patient became bradycardic to the 50s

PULSES:

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2117-10-8**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-8**], the right IJ
catheter has
been removed. Little change in the appearance of the heart and
lungs with
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and blunting of the
costophrenic angles bilaterally. No definite pulmonary vascular
congestion at this time.
.
TTE [**2117-10-8**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60-70%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of 25 vNov ember v2008, probably no major change.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**2117-10-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Mild aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta without
evidence of
dissection or intramural hematoma.
3. Diffuse ground-glass opacities and septal thickening within
the lungs with bilateral pleural effusions, likely on the basis
of pulmonary edema/fluid overload. There is also cardiomegaly.
4. Stable intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and air as well
as common
bile duct dilatation.
5. Mesenteric stranding and fluid in a peripancreatic region
around the
pancreatic head extending into the porta hepatis and anterior
perirenal
fascia. These findings may relate to pancreatitis, please
clinically
correlate with patient's laboratory values.
6. Poor renal cortical enhancement identified on arterial phase
imaging,
which is symmetric. Given patient's history of recent PEA
arrest, ATN is
highly considered.
7. Featureless appearance of the entire large bowel with
intramural fat
deposition and absence of skip lesions. No pericolonic
inflammatory changes are noted. These findings may be related to
burnt out/chronic ulcerative colitis, as opposed to a more acute
process.
8. Ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o F with CAD presenting with abdominal pain, bradycardia
progressing to PEA arrest, s/p resuscitation, intubated and on
pressors.
.
# RHYTHM/PEA:  Has chronic history of a-fib (on
anticoagulation).  Patient became asystolic while in ED in the
setting of bradycardia.  Suspect vagal episode.  Was coded by ED
team, intubated, and had temporary pacer wire placed by
cardiology fellow.  Interestingly, unsure if the event was true
asystole, as patient seems to recall the entire event.
Pulse/pressure returned and patient immediately trasferred to
CCU.  Patient extubated on hospital day 2.  In paced rhythm with
HR of 90.  Telemetry without other events, and temporary pacer
wire was removed soon thereafter. Of note, etiology likely
bradycardia/vagal reaction, as CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis not
consistent with other etiologies of PEA/asystole including
trauma, pneumothorax, aortic dissection, PE, AAA, MI, mesenteric
ischemia, etc. Patient's HR ranged from 90s-110s, while on
metoprolol 75 mg tid.  Patient was discharged on the following
regimen for rate control: coreg 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], dilt ER 120 mg daily.
.
#Hypotension: unclear etiology, but in the setting of her
PEA/asystolic/bradycardia event. Patient was weaned of pressors
fairly rapidly while in the CCU, did well, was soon transferred
to floor.  Pt continued to be normotensive upon discharge.
.
# Abdominal pain - CT abdomen/pelvis without clear etiology for
abdominal pain. Pain resolved fairly rapidly and may have been
related to incomplete obstruction/constipation.
.
# Hypoxia: CXR with ?LLL infiltrate, cardiomegaly, coin lesion
in RLL. In setting of her leukocytosis, empiric flagyl and
levofloxacin were started. Abx were continued for total of 5
days.
.
#Acute renal failure: Baseline Creatinine 1.0, was 2.0 on
presentation, suspect etiology to be pre-renal insult in setting
of her bradycardia/asystolic event. On discharge, Cr was 1, at
baseline.
.
#Leukocytosis: WBC 20.0. Suspected from stress of cardiac
arrest, epinephrine administration.  Unlikely from abdominal
catastophy as CT abdomen and pelvis negative for acute process.
Patient to complete 5 day course of flagyl and levofloxacin.
.
# CORONARIES:  History of CAD s/p CABG in [**2116**]. Continued on
aspirin, atorvastatin. Cardiac enzymes not c/w ACS.
.
# PUMP:  History of HTN- patient on carvedilol 25mg PO BID and
lasix 40mg daily. Echo from [**10-8**] showing moderately dilated LA.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of 25 vNov ember v2008, probably no
major change.
.
# Anticoagulation- on [**Month/Year (2) **] 2mg daily for chronic a-fib.  On
discharge INR was 3.1, likely elevated in setting of short
course of antibiotics.  Pt will have close foll
