History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93756**] is a 66 yo Male well-known to the Thoracic service
now presenting from rehab facility with hypotension, hypoxia,
and thick respiratory secretions. Mr [**Known firstname 93876**] previously had a
3-hole esophagectomy in [**2104**] for Esophageal CA and on [**2119-8-2**]
underwent repair of tracheoesophageal fistula at [**Hospital1 18**].  He was
readmitted on [**2119-9-13**] for GNR positive blood cxs, renal failure,
and leaking from J-tube. He had multidrug resistant klebsiella
and proteus bacteremia and was placed on Meropenem. Urine
cultures grew VRE and he was placed on Linezolid.  The
antibiotics were continued until [**2119-9-30**].

This evening the patient presented from his facility with
hypotension (SBP in 70's), tachycardia (110-130), and increasing
respiratory rate and oxygen requirment.  He was noted to have
increasing secretions and a thickening of the secretions.
Patient is also complaing of chest pain, which appears to be
chronic, and abdominal pain which is apparently a new complaint.
Patient reports some nausea today, but no vomiting. Reports
fevers and chills over the past two days.

Cultures:
multidrug resistant klebsiella and proteus sensitive to
meropenum

CXR:
[**2119-11-7**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], the
nasogastric tube has been
removed. There is little overall change in the appearance of the
heart and
lungs and monitoring and support devices. Bilateral pleural
effusions with
bibasilar atelectasis are again seen. Some indistinctness of
pulmonary
vessels again is consistent with some elevation in pulmonary
venous pressure.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 93756**] was admitted from the ED on [**2119-10-3**] with hypotension
and tachycardia. While in the ED he was given a fluid challenge
with a good response He was re-started back on his previous
antibiotics meropenum for multidrug resistant Klebsiella
bacteremia and Proteus bacteremia, and Linezolid for VRE UTI. He
was pancultured. RUQ ultrasound showed a dilated gallbladder.
CT Torso showed small bowel which has herniated through the
diaphgragmatic hiatus adjacent to the gastric pull-up.  A
portion of pancreas also appears to be above the diaphragm.  On
[**2119-10-7**] he had Flexible upper endoscopy with endoscopic
placement of nasogastric tube (which he pulled out and was later
replaced). A fistula could not be visualized but we could
clearly see the Jagwire as it entered the stomach about a
centimeter below the esophagogastric anastomosis, therefore
identifying the fistula location.

ID:  Was consulted and recommended continue previous
antibiotics.  Repeat BAL. Cultures only growing Proteus and
Klebs. Urine culture was negative therefore Linezolid was
stopped on [**2119-10-8**].  Pt's white count and fever curve improved
over the next week and a half, and his antibiotic regimen was
then stopped on [**10-17**].  On [**10-27**], the patient was thought to
have aspirated some of his bilious NGT secretions, and a WBC to
14 was noted.  Proteus and Klebsiella were again found in the
sputum and GU tract cultures, and the patient was given a 10d
course of meropenem which ended on [**11-7**].  The patient has been
afebrile since with a normal WBC count.

Respiratory: Pt intially placed on mechanical ventilation on
admission for low 02 saturations.  Weaned to CPAP 8/5 with
oxygen saturations of 98%, eventually progressed to tolerating
only Trach piece by [**10-24**].  On [**10-27**], pt desaturated in the
setting of presumed aspiration.  Bronchoscopy yielded only
minimal thin secretions, pt required CMV for adequate
oxygenation.  Weaned again to trach piece by [**11-1**], but then a
trip to the operating room for EGD/wound vac placement resulted
in the patient being placed on CMV and CPAP for 2-3 days.  By
[**11-8**], the patient had been able to tolerate trach piece
ventilation for multiple hours a day, mainly needing minimal
CPAP assistance at night.

GI: on [**10-13**], the patient was taken to the operating room for
hiatal hernia repair for ? colonic obstruction in the setting of
large amounts of NGT output.  An abdominal CT scan showed
herniation of the transverse colon and part of the pancreas into
the thoracic cavity.  The abdomen was left open after this
operation due to concerns that his large amount of ascites and
increased abdominal pressure would not allow for adequate
closure.  On [**10-17**], a [**State 19827**] patch was placed to facilitate
stepwise abdominal closure.  After hernia repair and [**State **]
patch placement, the patient continued to have copious bilious
drainage from the NGT placed in the gastric conduit and
intolerance of NGT clamping.  A SBFT study was obtained on [**
