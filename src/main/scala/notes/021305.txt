Allergies:
Demerol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Right leg claudication.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right common femoral endarterectomy and right
femoral popliteal bypass with nonreverse saphenous vein and
angioscopy

The flexible bronchoscope was
passed through the tracheostomy tube which terminated in the
midline position. There was a moderate amount of clear
secretions throughout the airways which were therapeutically
aspirated. There were no endobronchial lesions at the
subsegmental level bilaterally. There was moderate to severe
malacia in the right mainstem bronchus, as well as moderate
malacia in the left mainstem bronchus.


History of Present Illness:
55-year-old gentleman with severe peripheral vascular disease
has had severe disabling claudication of his right lower
extremity. He has some iliac
disease, diffuse common femoral disease, a long segment right
superficial femoral artery occlusion with reconstitution of  a
below-knee popliteal artery and good 2-vessel runoff to the
foot.


Past Medical History:
- vocal cord CA s/p radiation/laryngectomy/trach
- chronically elevated WBC (on prednisone for Rx)
- HTN
- R knee replacement
- tonisllectomy

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Hyperdynamic LVEF. TVI E/e' < 8, suggesting normal
PCWP (<12mmHg).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Normal
mitral valve supporting structures. Normal LV inflow pattern for
age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal
tricuspid valve supporting structures. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal   image quality - poor parasternal views. Suboptimal
image quality - poor apical   views.

Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular   cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall   motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Left ventricular systolic   function is hyperdynamic
(EF 80%). Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an   E/e' <8
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no   aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with   trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial  effusion.





Brief Hospital Course:
To Note:

Pt deceased this hospital course vocal cord CA s/p
radiation/laryngectomy/trach, chronically elevated WBC (on
prednisone).

[**2137-3-29**]

Pt underwent a Right common femoral endarterectomy and right
femoral popliteal bypass with nonreverse saphenous vein and
angioscopy. Pt tolerated the procedure well, there were no
complications. Pt extubated in the OR. Transfered to the PACU in
stable condition.

Once recovered from anesthesia, pt transfered to the VICU in
stable condition.

[**2137-3-30**] - [**2137-3-31**]

Pt did well in the [**Hospital 25075**] transfered to the floor in stable
condition. On [**2137-3-31**] pt was noted to have decrease o2. ABG was
obtained. Trigger was then called. Pt intubated and placed in
the SICU.

Diagnosis of ARDS was made shortly after.

[**2137-4-1**]

The flexible bronchoscope was passed through the tracheostomy
tube which terminated in the midline position. There was a
moderate amount of clear secretions throughout the airways which
were therapeutically aspirated. There were no endobronchial
lesions at the subsegmental level bilaterally. There was
moderate to severe
malacia in the right mainstem bronchus, as well as moderate
malacia in the left mainstem bronchus.


[**2137-4-1**] - [**2137-4-27**]

Pt remained intubated, fevers, multiple attempts at weanig
patient from vent. pulmonary consulted. Input appreciated. Pt
put on Antibiotics / the AB were adjusted to the sensitivities /
multiple bronchs. Pt could not be weaned from vent.

Bronch/BAL->klebsiella oxytoca pan s (except augmentin), GNR#2,
yeast

Thigh U/S w/ 3 collections:prox 2.2x7.7/ distally 5.5x1.3x3.0cm/
medial to knee 3.7x3.2

Sputum->pseudomonas(panS), GNR

CT Chest-consolidation/ground glass infiltrate

Echo->hyperdynamic

In short Pt  developed diffuse severe pulmonary edema,
interstitial disease. pt had bouts of being febrile an then
having no fevers. Antibiotics were adjusted according to
sensitivities.

Pulm thought that the pt developed bronchial malachia.
