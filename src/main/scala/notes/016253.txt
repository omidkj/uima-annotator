Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2042**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old male with history of
bronchoalveolar carcinoma undergoing chemotherapy with
gemcitabine, CAD s/p stent placement, DMII, OSA on CPAP,
presenting with chief complaint of shortness of breath and
hypoxia for 1 week. The patient reports that he frequently uses
a home O2 monitor along with his CPAP. Over the last few days,
this O2 monitor has been demonstrating readings in the low 80s.
He typically only uses O2 in the evenings (6L), but over the
last few days has been using O2 continuously. The patient also
endorses worsening dyspnea, both on exertion and at rest over
the last week. As of a few weeks ago, he was able to walk on a
treadmill for ~5 minutes without significant SOB. Over the last
few days, he has spent most of his time in bed. Endorses
increase in cough over last week, with mild sputum production.
No fevers or chills. No sick contacts at home.

Of note, the patient began chemotherapy with Gemcitabine on
[**11-9**]. He
received 1000 mg/m2 on days 1,8, and had planned for day 15.

In the ED inital vitals were, HR 78, O2 80% RA. Labs were
significant for WBC 2.4 (baseline [**6-1**]), plts 107 (baseline
200s), lactate 1.6, and Cr 1.3 (baseline). CXR showed worsening
mid to lower lung ground-glass opacities which may reflect
worsening bronchoalveolar carcinoma versus superimposed
pneumonia. EKG was unchanged from prior. The patient was given
cefepime X 1 and vancomycin X 1 for presumed HCAP. He was also
given albuterol and ipratropium nebs X 1. Vitals at the time of
transfer were: 98.0 80 109/49 22 90 6L (Pt baseline at home
90-92 on [**4-30**] L)

On arrival to the ICU, the patient's VS: 97.9 81 111/65  24 94%
NRB 15L O2. He reports ongoing cough with mild sputum
production.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
Dr. [**Known lastname 97128**] is a 78-year-old man with bronchoalveolar carcinoma
diagnosed in [**4-3**]. CT scan done on [**2160-4-1**], while admitted for
treatment for pneumonia, demonstrated widespread ground-glass
opacities, more severe in the right lower lobe with increased
number of mediastinal lymph nodes. A transbronchial biopsy on
[**2160-4-3**] showed a pathology suspicious for bronchioalveolar
carcinoma.  A PET scan done on [**2160-4-17**] showed a FDG-avid area of
lobar ground glass opacity with bowing of the intralobar fissure
involving the right lower lobe compatible with history of
pneumonic type bronchoalveolar carcinoma, though given high
avidity may represent superinfection in this region. He also had
interval improvement in the left lower lobe and right middle
lobe ground-glass opacity since the chest CT from [**2160-4-1**]. MRI
brain [**2160-4-17**] did not show any evidence of metastases. He was
followed clinically for several months, but he was hospitalized
frequently for pneumonia and ultimately for altered mental
status
in [**11-3**].  An MR of his head at that time showed new cortical
T2/FLAIR-hyperintensity along the medial aspect of  the left
frontal lobe, and extending along the base of the left frontal
lobe  and the orbitofrontal gyrus in the anterior cranial fossa.
 He started therapy with Alimta [**2160-12-9**] and had a dramatic
clinical improvement but stable imaging findings.

Other Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes mellitus type 2, on glipizide and metformin.
2. Coronary artery disease, s/p MI [**2139**], and s/p stenting in
[**2149**].
3. Bladder cancer, followed by [**Doctor Last Name **].
4. Obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP.
5. Hypertension.
6. Hyperlipidemia.
7. Allergic rhinitis.
8. Status post right total knee replacement.
9. Chronic back pain/spinal stenosis s/p L4/L5 laminectomy in
[**2113**].
10. Status post right ulnar impingement release.
11. Erectile dysfunction.
12. History of erysipelas with chronic right lower extremity
skin changes.
13. GERD.
14. Depression.
15. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma, Dx [**2160-3-26**], on chemotherapy.

Social History:
He lives with his wife. They are independent for all of their
activities of daily living. He was a three-pack-per-day smoker
until his early 20's (15-20 pack-year hx). He does not drink or
use drugs. He is still occasionally working as a psychiatrist,
but is not working presently.

Family History:
Lymphoma in his father, mother with rectal cancer. Both parents
had heart disease. Other relatives had diabetes mellitus.

CXR [**2162-11-22**]:
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There
is interval increase in ground-glass opacities involving the
bilateral lower lungs which is concerning for interval
progression of bronchoalveolar carcinoma though the possibility
of a superimposed pneumonia is impossible to exclude. No large
effusions or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
normal. Bony structures appear grossly intact.
IMPRESSION: Worsening mid to lower lung ground-glass opacities
which may
reflect worsening bronchoalveolar carcinoma versus superimposed
pneumonia. Recommend followup post-treatment films.

CTA [**2162-11-23**]:
MEDIASTINUM: Pulmonary artery proximal to the bifurcation
measures 26 mm and is normal in caliber. No filling defects
within main, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental branches of
pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism.
Heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. There is
no septal
bulge or right heart strain. Atherosclerotic calcification in
the coronary
arteries is moderate to severe. The thyroid gland is normal.
Borderline
sized lymph nodes and multiple other small nodes which do not
meet CT size
criteria for pathological enlargement are unchanged since
[**2162-10-14**].
AIRWAYS AND LUNGS: Airways are patent to subsegment bronchi.
Allowing for
differences in CT technique, since [**2162-10-14**], multifocal
ground-glass opacities predominantly in bilateral lower lobe
have progressed, which is marked in left lower lung. Given that
known multifocal BAC has been slowly progressing, this short
interval increase in opacities is more likely a result of
superimposed aspiration or infection or hemorrhage. Interval
progression of lung malignancy is less likely.
ABDOMEN: ThiS study is not designed for assessment of
subdiaphragmatic
pathologies; however, limited views are unremarkable. Adrenal
glands are
normal in morphology.
BONES: D3 and D7 vertebral bodies demonstr
