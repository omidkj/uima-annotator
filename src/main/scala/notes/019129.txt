Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated
Arterial Line

History of Present Illness:
74F morbid obese, history of severe COPD, obesity
hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes,
hypertension, diastolic heart failure with recent diuretic
initiation and hypothyroidism BIBA from nursing home with
shortness of breath, depressed mental status. Her pOx was
reported to be 60 % on 2L NC and 90 % on 15L O2 NRB in triage.
She was scheduled to have ICU sleep study on Monday to titrate
O2/CO2 use due to severe OHVS. She was having a few day history
of cough - but uncertain if productive or not.

.
In the ED, initial vs were:  70   22 90% 15L nrb

She was initially tried on NIPPV in ER (15/10) but ABG
suggestive of hypercapneic respiratory failure (pH 7.16 pCO2 122
pO2 102 HCO3 46). She was also placed on nitro gtt. Given
declining mental status and ABG, she was intubated by anesthesia
secondary to obesity without complications with usage of
etomidate 8, succinycholine 120. She experienced brief period of
hypotenstion to SBP 80s after intubation in setting of
fentanyl/versed. She was noted to have thick secretions. She was
given 250 mL NS bolus x 1 with resultant pressure of SBP 103/49.
Repeat ABG pH 7.36 pCO2 70, pO2 161, HCO3 41 .

CXR performed showing mild to moderate congestive heart failure
with small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace
opacities, possibly infection or atelectasis.

She was placed on vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin for
questionable pulmonic process on CXR. She was given bumex 1 mg
IV x 1 with poor urine output. Labs significant for WBC 17.5
with 78% N, 10 % L, Myelos 2 %, Cr 1.2 (baseline 0.8), HCO3 41
(baseline low to mid 30s), lactate 0.8. Blood cultures are
pending.

She was admitted for respiratory failure with possible component
of CHF vs. pneumonia and OHVS.

Discharge Labs:

Reports:
[**9-12**] CTA: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE to the segmental level; no evidence of
aortic intramural hematoma or aortic dissection.
2. Moderate atelectasis of the right lower lobe and mild
atelectasis of the left lower lobe with small bilateral pleural
effusions.
3. Enlarged epicardial lymph node - 3 month follow-up is
recommended after
resolution of the current acute illness.
.
Shoulder x-ray ([**2178-9-17**]): per discussion with radiologist via
phone.
Severe degenerative changes in joing space between glenoid &
humerus, indicative of severe osteoarthritis. Also patient's
humerus is sitting high in joint space and could be indicative
of a rotator cuff injury. No fractures.

Brief Hospital Course:
74F morbid obese, history severe COPD, obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, DM, HTN, dCHF, hypothyroidism
presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was
initially intubated for respiratory failure and hypercarbia but
was weaned, extubated and started on shovel mask with good
result.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial from
central apnea/ hypoventilation, COPD, ?pulmonary edema from CHF
exacerbation. ABG suggestive of reversible component with
ventilation. She was initially intubated, extubated easily and
successfully treated with BIPAP. She received a sleep study that
showed hypoventilation (C02 75-85) with oxygen-responsive
hypoxia.  However, the patient had difficulty of air leak around
her mouth throughout the night.  Even with air leak, CO2
continued to improve from 85 to 75. Oxygen saturations remained
88-93% on 50% face shovel. Patient's home BIPAP settings were
changed to 18/8 and she has been stable with these treatments.
-upon arrival to the floor, Patient's daytime requirement was
weaned to baseline of 2.5L NC.
.
# Leukocytosis: The patient was admitted with a mild
leukocytosis.  CXR did not suggest discrete infiltrate. UA was
clean, pan cultures were negative.  The patient received
vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin on admission.
Antibiotics were discontinued with the absence of evidence of
infection.  The patient's leukocytosis improved.
.
# new MRSA + status: While patient did not have pneumonia, she
was screened for MRSA and is found to be MRSA positive.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation - On
admission, CXR showed increased markings compatible with
possible CHF exacerbation.  She was ruled out for MI by EKG and
cardiac enzymes.  She received bumex in ER with unknown urine
output. On admission, diuresis was held due to elevated
creatinine.  With improvement in renal function, patient was
given bumex 50 mg x 1, with good response.
-after arrival to the floor, patient was restarted on Toprol 50
XL daily & Bumex 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Shoulder pain - upon arrival to the floor, patient described
worsening of pain in L shoulder. Plain film of shoulder shows
osteoarthritis and possible rotator cuff injury. Pain was
controlled with Naproxen 250mg PO BID.
.
# CT finding: Patient had a chest CT in the ICU that should an
incidental epicardial lymph node which needs to be followed up
on by PCP as outpatient. Patient will need PCP to [**Name9 (PRE) 97792**] with
CT in 3 months and to follow up with patient on results.
.
# Acute renal failure - The patient was admitted with Cr 1.2
(baseline Cr 0.8). [**Last Name (un) **] on admission likely due to ATN in the
setting of hypovolemia.  Blood pressures normalized and her
creatinine returned to baseline.
.
# COPD - Chronic.  Patient d
