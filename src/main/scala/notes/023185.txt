Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization
which showed normal coronary arteries. The remainder of her
preadmission testing was unremarkable and she was cleared for
surgery.  On [**1-31**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed a minimally
invasive mitral valve repair. The operation was complicated by
loss of intercostal muscle and chest wall instability which
required chest wall reconstruction by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please
see operative notes for further details. Following the
operation, she was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. Due to inadequate pain management,
the pain service was consulted to assist in postoperative
management. It took several days to wean from inotropic support
and she required units of packed red blood cells for
postoperative anemia. Also experienced postoperative atrial
fibrillation for which lopressor, Multaq and Warfarin
anticoagulation was initiated. She made slow, clinical
improvement and eventually transferred to the step down unit on
postoperative day six. Postoperative course further complicated
by C. difficile colitis which was treated with PO Flagyl.
She was evaluated and treated by physical therapy for stength
and conditioning. She was cleared for discharge to home on
POD#10.
