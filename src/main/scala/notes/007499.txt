Pertinent Results:
intra-op echo [**2186-6-2**]
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
4. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal
free wall contractility.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There
is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
9. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of epi, milrinone, phenylephrine, insulin.
AV pacing. Well-seated mechanical valve in thje mitral position
with characteristic washing jets. Well-seated annuloplasty ring
in the tricuspid positipon. TR is now mild. Mildly depressed RV
function on inotropic support. LVEF is 65%.

SEROTONIN RELEASE ANTIBODY
                    PLATELET AND NEUTROPHIL IMMUNOLOGY
Unfractionated Heparin-Dependent Platelet Antibody (SRA)***
Unfractionated Heparin Low Dose:       100 %
Unfractionated Heparin High Dose:        2 %
Unfractionated Heparin Result: Positive
    A positive result requires release of serotonin from target
platelets in the presence of patient serum and low dose (0.1
U/ml)heparin of >20%, together with inhibition of release (<20%)
with high dose (100 U/ml) heparin. Results obtained with this
patient's serum were negative.  These results argue against, but
do not completely rule out a diagnosis of Heparin-Induced
Thrombocytopenia
(HIT).
