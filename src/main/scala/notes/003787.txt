Intensive Care Unit and underwent q one hour neuro checks
during which time her blood pressure was maintained with the
systolic below 140 using the Nipride drip.  Upon admission to
the Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit otolaryngology and
plastic surgery were both asked to evaluate the patient
regarding the bilateral hemotympanum and the potential
temporomandibular joint fracture respectively.  The
oropharyngology consult placed a wick in the left ear with
otic microbial drops and recommended outpatient follow up
with audiogram.  The plastic surgery service felt the above
mentioned radiographic findings and her clinical examination
were not indication for further intervention regarding her
potential temporomandibular joint fracture.  On hospital day
two the patient received repeat head CT mentioned above that
was without significant change from prior study and the
neurosurgery service felt that her injuries were stable and
warranted outpatient neurosurgery follow up.

was re-evaluated in the morning by the above mentioned
services.  Upon re-evaluation by psychiatry medical service

was discharged from the floor to home on hospital day three.
