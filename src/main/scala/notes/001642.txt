PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2184**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.3??????, blood pressure 113/68, pulse
83.
GENERAL:  Alert and oriented to person only in no acute
distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Dry mucous membranes,
bilateral surgical pupils, no jugular venous distention.
NECK:  Supple.
PULMONARY:  Bibasilar rales, no wheezes.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper
sternal border with 1/6 regurgitant murmur, holosystolic
murmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the
apex.  The PMI is nondisplaced and is a normal size.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  Large 10 x 5 cm medial right malleolus ulcer
with scattered areas of necrosis and surrounding erythema.
There is no swelling.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count 10.9, hematocrit 31.5, platelets
416.  SMA-7 143, 5.7, 104, 23, 43, 1.7 and 106.  Urinalysis
showed trace ketones, small bilirubin, nitrite negative, no
leukocyte esterase, no red blood cells.

IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion,
but no cardiomegaly.  A head CT was negative and hip films
were also negative.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially
normotensive.  She was started on intravenous cefazolin and
developed hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the
80s.  She was then started on low dose dopamine and admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.
Admission electrocardiogram shows ST depressions in 1, 2, F,
V5 and V6.  T-wave inversions present diffusely.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the CCU
with a strong concern of evolving non Q-wave myocardial
infarction.  Indeed, the patient's peak CK was 335 with an MB
of 28 and an MB index of 8.4.  The associated troponin was
16.1.  After discussion with the family, the patient was
conservatively managed and cardiac catheterization was not
pursued.

With volume resuscitation, the patient's hematocrit dropped
to 26.3.  Iron studies revealed the following:  an iron of
287, TIBC of 398, ferritin of 49 and transferrin of 306.  It
was felt that the patient had anemia of chronic disease on
the low hematocrit reflected hemodilution.  Her dose of
Niferex was increased to [**Hospital1 **] and her hematocrit remained
stable after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells.

In terms of the patient's elevated creatinine, this also
responded quickly to volume resuscitation.

The patient had recently been in house with a concern of a
right lower extremity cellulitis versus pyoderma gangrenosum.
The patient was seen by dermatology and it was felt that the
lesion was most consistent with partially treated ulcerated
cellulitis.  The patient was initially started on cefazolin
and clindamycin.  She developed diarrhea in the setting of
clindamycin therapy.  Stool toxin assays did reveal the
presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin A and the
patient's clindamycin was discontinued and she was started on
metronidazole.  On the day of discharge, the patient was
switched over from intravenous cefazolin to oral cephalexin
with no difficulties.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and it was felt
that she was unsteady on her foot and would need 24 hour
supervision.

An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed a normal
ejection fraction, normal valves and no resting wall motion
abnormalities.

On [**2153-3-12**], the patient was felt to be medically stable for
discharge.  Given the setting in which the patient was
discovered and the physical therapy evaluation, it was felt
that she would benefit from a course of short term
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Discharged to short term
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levoxyl 75 mcg po qd
2.  Celexa 30 mg po qd

5.  MVI 1 tablet po qd
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd

11. Toprol XL 25 mg po qd
12. Zestril 10 mg po qd

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post non Q-wave myocardial infarction, peak CK of
355
2.  Resolving Clostridium difficile colitis
3.  Preserved cardiac pump function
4.  Anemia of chronic disease
5.  Right lower extremity cellulitis complicated by
ulceration

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up in
[**Hospital 2652**] Clinic at [**Hospital6 256**] in
one week's time.  The patient will follow up with her
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at [**Hospital6 2018**] in two weeks' time.
