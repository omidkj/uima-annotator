Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-5-25**] Mitral Valve Replacement(25mm [**Company 1543**] Porcine) and
Single Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(LIMA to LAD).


History of Present Illness:
This is a 79 year old female with worsening shortness of breath
since [**2134-11-1**]. Echocardiogram in [**2135-2-1**] showed mitral
stenosis and regurgitation with an LVEF of 70%. Cardiac
catheterization showed 50% lesions in the LAD and RCA. Based
upon the above, she was referred for cardiac surgical
evaluation.

Physical Exam:
PREOP EXAM
Vitals: 112/60, 72, 20
General: Frail elderly female, mildly short of breath
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD
Lungs: CTA bilaterally, decreased at bases
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, mixed systolic and diastolic
murmur
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, no edema, few varicosities
Pulses: 1+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-5-25**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Left coronary cusp is
heavily calcified. Peak gradient across the valve is less than
10 mm of Hg. By planimetry the valve area is around 2.2 cm2. No
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2).
An eccentric, posterior directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe MAC is seen focally at the
mid anterior and posterior annuli.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
= 5 mmHg). No mitral regurgitation is seen. Tarce central MR is
seen. A small paravalvular leak is seen at the postero-medial
part of the annulus (2 'O' Clock position)
2. [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function is preserved.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent mitral valve replacement
and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Following the operation, she was brought to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, she awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated without incident. Given her history of
DVT, she was maintained on subcutaneous Heparin. She was started
on low dose beta blockade. She maintained stable hemodynamics
and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day two. She was
transferred back to the ICU on POD #3 after her blood pressure
fell to 70/40 and she was difficult to arouse. She improved and
was subsequently hypertensive requiring a nitro drip, her
anti-hypertensives were increased. She was transferred back to
the floor on POD #6. The remainder of her postoperative course
was uncomplicated. On POD#8 Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was ready to be
discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further
conditioning, activity, and increased strength.
