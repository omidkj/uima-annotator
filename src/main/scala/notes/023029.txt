Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
white male with a history of a motor vehicle accident in
[**2140-10-5**], hospital course complicated by prolonged
Medical Intensive Care Unit stay and prolonged intubation
requiring tracheostomy placement.  He was recently admitted
on [**2141-9-15**] for tracheostomy removal and was
discharged on [**2141-9-17**] without any complications.

The patient was sent back to his nursing home, Meadowbrook,
and was doing well until [**2141-9-23**], at which time he
began to notice increased shortness of breath and a
nonproductive cough.  He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2141-9-24**] and intubated for
airway protection and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient also received
a nasogastric tube for medications, without complications.
His Medical Intensive Care Unit course was fairly uneventful.
He was started on a steroid course, Levaquin and albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizers secondary to a chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease exacerbation.

A chest x-ray on admission also showed a possible right lower
lobe infiltrate, which was new.  A CT of the airway done on
[**2141-9-25**] showed focal tracheal stenosis, likely
secondary to previous tracheostomy tube complication,
characterized by polypoid thickening of the tracheal wall and
extending approximately 1.5 cm into the craniocaudal
dimension.  They also noted small airway disease in both
lower lobes with associated patchy dependent consolidation,
suggesting possible aspiration.  A CT scan of his airway was
repeated on [**2141-9-27**], showing tracheal stenosis
unchanged.  They noted that the maximum area of narrowing was
approximately at the thoracic inlet level with reduced
transverse dimension to 9 mm.  Further plans were made for a
bronchoscopy in the next few days.

The patient was extubated successfully on [**2141-9-26**]
without event and then transferred to the floor on [**2141-9-27**] under the care of the [**Hospital1 139**] Medicine Firm.  Of
note, in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he received tube
feeds without complication and the nasogastric tube was
removed on [**2141-9-26**].  He tolerated clears well and
his diet was advanced as tolerated.

The [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit course was also
notable for an episode of sun-downing on [**2141-9-26**],
and he stayed in the Medical Intensive Care Unit one day
more.

On [**2141-9-28**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy,
which showed proximal subglottic stenosis and a 16 mm x 4 cm
stent was placed without difficulty.  He was followed
carefully for the next few days and will be discharged to his
nursing home on [**2141-9-30**].

accident, status post multiple intubations, tracheostomies

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination on admission,
the patient had a temperature of 99, pulse 102, blood
pressure 170/100, respiratory rate 30 and oxygen saturation
92% to 96% on 80%/20% helium/oxygen.  General:  Elderly ill
appearing male in moderate respiratory distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round, and reactive to
light, anicteric sclerae, extraocular movements intact,
mucous membranes dry.  Neck:  Tracheostomy site patent with
purulent secretions.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac, systolic
ejection murmur II/VI at left upper sternal border.  Lungs:
Wheezing, grunting, poor air movement, diffuse rhonchi, dry
crackles at bilateral bases.  Abdomen:  Scaphoid, nontender,
normal active bowel sounds, no masses, no bruits.
Extremities:  Left brace in place, thin, thready pulses
distally.  Neurologic examination:  Cranial nerves II through

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission white blood cell count was 12.3,
hematocrit 38, platelet count 361,000, sodium 139, potassium
4.7, chloride 100, bicarbonate 31, BUN 15, creatinine 0.7 and
glucose 53.  Initial arterial blood gases showed a pH of
7.44, pCO2 43 and pO2 356.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated
[**2141-9-24**] for airway protection and hypercarbic
respiratory failure and extubated [**2141-9-26**].
Initially started on ciprofloxacin but changed over to
Levaquin for a presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare and possible pneumonia.  He was also placed on
albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, which were weaned to meter
dose inhalers without event.  He was also started on
intravenous Solu-Medrol 100 mg three times a day, which was
weaned to twice a day on transfer to the floor and then down
to Prednisone 60 mg three times a day.  As stated above, two
CT scans revealed tracheal stenosis and he underwent a rigid
bronchoscopy on [**2141-9-28**] and a tracheal stent was
placed.

2.  Hematology:  Of note, the patient's hematocrit dropped
from 38 to 30.1.  This continued to be monitored and his
hematocrit stabilized.

3.  Infectious disease:  As stated above, the patient was
placed on Levaquin 500 mg daily for 14 days for possible
pneumonia.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient has a history of diabetes
mellitus.  He was placed on his standing dose of NPH and
sliding scale regular insulin, and fingersticks were checked
regularly.  A nutrition consult was obtained in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, resulting in tube feeds, which were
discontinued when the patient began to tolerate oral intake.

5.  Code status:  The patient is a full code, with the
exception of prolonged respiratory assistance.  His wife and
the patient state that they would like absolutely everything
done unless he has extensive brain injury.  Of note, Mr.
[**Known lastname 4114**] comes into the hospital each time labeled "Do Not
Resuscitate", which is incorrect.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4114**] will be discharged to
his nursing home.  He will stay on all home medications in
addition to a Prednisone taper and oral Levaquin 500 mg daily
for approximately 14 days; Levaquin was started on [**2141-9-24**], thus the end will be on [**10-8**] or 5, [**2140**].

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow up with his primary care
physician at [**Name Initial (PRE) **] later time.
