Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
74 year old woman with hx of bipolar disorder, diastolic CHF,
progressive cognitive decline presenting with altered mental
status and hypoxia. Initially she was admitted from home on
[**2123-12-13**] to SEMC with cc of weakness. She had been completing a
course of ciprofloxacin for a UTI. Additionally her course was
notable for acute renal failure that was consistent with
pre-renal azotemia prior to discharge her Cr was 0.6. During
that admission she had resolving urinary symptoms but did
develop bibasilar crackles after IVF repletion. Speech and
swallow eval recommended nectar thicken liquids and mechanical
soft diet. She had her ciprofloxacin changed to Augmentin prior
to discharge to cover for possible aspiration. She was
discharged to [**Hospital 1191**] Hospital on [**2123-12-15**]. Soon after arrival to
the [**Doctor First Name 1191**] she was noted to be in respiratory distress with
O2sat 92% on 2L and increased work of breathing. She was
transferred back to SEMC. A Section 12 was completed on transfer
from [**Doctor First Name 1191**] to SEMC. Upon return to SEMC, the patient's family
requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, her intial vital signs were 99.2
66 120/66 18 75%RA ->100%NRB
An EKG was interpreted as unremarkable. A CXR was interpreted as
bilateral pneumonia. Attempts were made at weaning her NRB
however she continued to desat to mid-70s on RA. 1L of NS was
given as well as vanc/zosyn/levofloxacin.

CXR:
AP SEMI-UPRIGHT BEDSIDE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: This exam is limited
due to AP
semi-upright technique. There are moderate bilateral pleural
effusions as
well as probable bibasilar atelectasis. Superimposed pneumonia
cannot be
excluded as the lung bases are not well visualized. The lung
apices appear
unremarkable. The aorta is again tortuous.

IMPRESSION:
Limited study. Moderate bibasilar effusions and atelectasis;
superimposed
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
Video Swallow:
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: The patient aspirated a moderate amount
of nectar and thin liquid. Prompting was required for throat
clearing, which resulted in only partial clearance of the
aspirated material.

IMPRESSION: Silent aspiration of moderate amounts of thin and
nectar-thick
liquids.




Brief Hospital Course:
74F with diastolic CHF, bipolar, dementia preseneds with
hypoxemia. She was initially admitted from home to [**Hospital6 5505**] on [**2123-12-13**] for UTI and acute renal failure
which resolved with IVF. She was discharged to [**Hospital 1191**] Hospital
on [**2123-12-15**]. Soon after arrival to the [**Doctor First Name 1191**] she was noted to
be in respiratory distress with O2sat 92% on 2L and she was
transferred back to St. Es. The patient's family requested
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] and on arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER O2 sats were in
the 70s requiring NRB. She was initially admitted to the ICU and
transferred to the floor after improvement in her respiratory
status. The following is her course by problem.

# Aspiration vs. Health Care Associated Pneumonia/Respiratory
distress and hypoxia: With elevated WBC#, CXR findings and
markedly increased secretions in a patient with recent altered
mental status and pre-existing dysphagia most concerning was
health care associated pneumonia due to aspiration event. Lower
likelihood for CHF exacerbation given lack of ischemic EKG
changes and patient was markedly volume depleted on exam.
Ventilation likely challenged by marked restrictive physiology
from kyphosis.   Due to low 02 sats, the patient was amitted to
the MICU.  The patient was started on Vanco/Zosyn/Levofloaxacin.
 A sputum culture, urine legionella antibody were drawn.  She
was weaned from a non-rebreather overnight to 4LNC.  In the
morning, levofloxacin was d/c'd as no indication for covering
for atypicals (no cavitation in CXR and no witnessed aspiration
event).  Urine legionella was negative.  Patient was too
somnolent in evening for nursing to do trial of swallow so she
remained NPO on maintanence fluids.  Patient continued to
improve and was able to wean to 3 LNC upon transfer to the
floor. This was finally weaned down to 97% 2 L NC. Vancomycin
and Zosyn were continued to complete a 7 day course.
.
# Aspiration/Failure to Thrive/Goals of care: Pt has known
history of aspiration per Swallow eval [**3-30**]. Per family, she has
had a decline in being able to perform ADLs at home over the
past year, with significant weight loss over the past year. It
is felt by pts physicians and her family that the pt has had an
eating disorder her entire life. Discussed the idea of
tubefeeding with pt, husband, and several daughters. We
discussed that tubefeeding will not decrease risk of aspiration,
and will not prolong life, would not bring functional status
back to baseline, and may only temporarily help with nutrition.
Pt finds much joy in eating, and expresses that she would not
want to stop eating. Pt at this time is capable of making her
own decisions. Speech and swallow saw pt and performed video
swallow eval, which showed aspiration with nectar thickened
liquids, but not with honey thickened liquids. Speech and
swallow recommended a diet of honey thickened liquids, ground
solids, whole pills with puree, and ensure pudding. Geriatrics
was consulted to further discuss goals of care with pt and her
family. We addressed pros and cons of tubefeeding with family,
and we felt that the pt clearly stated she did not want a
feeding tube. Given the family's orthodox [**Hospital1 **] religion which
advocates for all life-sustaining measures, we explained that in
this circumstance a feeding tube will not prolong pts life and
may cause suffering.We felt pt has reached a level of decline
which is not much reversible, even with tubefeeds. Geriatrics
provided family literature to
