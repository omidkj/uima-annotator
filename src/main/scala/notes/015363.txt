History of Present Illness:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old man with a history of relapsed
multiple myeloma who presents with mental status changes.  Per
his daughter, was intermittently confused for the past week.  He
thought he was supposed to come for a platelet transfusion this
evening (appointment is tomorrow), so he drove himself to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 23**] building but was confused there and was transported the
ED.  He had a headache prior to arrival to the ED.  He has
required multiple tranfusions of blood and platelets, every [**3-12**]
days, last one on [**2122-1-12**].  Per his records, he called his
oncologist's office on [**2121-1-14**] with increased daytime sleepiness.
 He had not been wearing his CPAP due to epistaxis.  Platelets
on [**2121-1-14**] were 11,000 and ANC was 900.
.
He was last seen by his oncologist on [**2122-1-5**] and was due to
start his 4th cycle of Velcade, bendamustine and dexamethasone
but this was held due to low blood counts.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.6 98 160/88 22 96%.  A stat
head CT showed air-fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses without
intracranial hemorrhage.  He later had a rectal temperature of
103.  Guaiac was positive with brown stool.  CXR also showed
PNA.  HCT was 26.0 (last values of 22.7 and 28.6) and platelets
were 8.  Creatinine was 3.5 (baseline 1.2 1/11 per Atrius). He
was neutropenic with an ANC of 754.  He was given Vanc and
Cefepime.  He was tachypneic and there are reports of
hemoptysis.  He reportedly became more hypoxic, lethargic and
tachypneic and was intubated.  He was put on Propofol, then
fentanyl/versed.  Vent setting prior to transport: rate 14, FiO2
100%, PEEP 10 O2 sat 97%. He received 2L of NS prior to arrival.

Oncologic History
[**2117**]: Evaluated for anemia, bone soreness and coagulopathy,
found to have MM with IgG level of 1.7g with monoclonal IgG
lambda spike.  Free labda light chains 1490mg in serum  Bone
marrow 59% plasma cells.  Had extensive bony lesions and renal
insufficiency.
[**11-11**]: XRT to right femoral neck and L4 spinus process which had
a pathological fracture.  [**Date range (1) 88307**] received 6 cycles of
velcade/decadron.  Tried thalomid and revlimid but did not
tolerate either
[**2-10**]: Bmbx showed minimal but persistent involvement with plasma
cell dyscrasia, 8% plasma cells.
[**Date range (1) 88308**] maintained on decadron alone
[**1-14**]:: developed progression of disease with soft tissue mass at
T9-T10 causing cord compression, started high-dose
dexamethasone.  XRT T8-T10 at [**Company 2860**] [**Location (un) 5871**]
[**2-11**]: Started Velcade/Decadron, but hospitalized x 2 duet o
recurrent fevers, found to have small vegetation on aortic vavle
but no positive blood cultures. Treated emperically with
doxycycline due to possible Bartonella, acyclovir, bactrim.
[**Date range (1) 88309**]: Velcade and decadron with doxil on [**4-13**]  Total of 5
cycles.
[**7-14**]: Repeat BmBx 50% plasma cells, inadequate response to
chemotherapy
[**Date range (1) 88310**]: Velcade, dexamethasoen, cyclophosphamide, Revlimid
for a total of 8 cycles. Cytoxan held for 6th cycle but then
resumed.
[**11-13**]: Developed jaw osteonecrosis; bisphosphonate held
[**2121-2-26**]: Autologous stem cell transplantion with melphalan
conditioning.
[**2121-6-29**]: Revlimid started 5mg/day
[**2121-7-7**]: BmBx 30% plasma cells, Revlimid increased to 10mg/day
[**2121-8-13**]: free lambda light chains 137; Revlimid increased to 20mg
and dexamethasone 40mg weekly added
[**2121-9-11**]: Revlimid d/c'd due to increasing light chains and
cytopenias
[**2121-10-7**]: resumed cyclophosphamide, velcade, dexamethasone and
had progression after 1 cycle
[**2121-10-27**]: chemotherapy switched to bendamustine, velcade,
dexamethasone, received 3 cycles so far

Brief Hospital Course:
57M with a history of end-stage multiple myeloma who presented
with AMS and Respiratory Failure. Viral swab was positive for
RSV and he was found to have sepsis with e.coli + psudomonal
bacteremia with likely foci of infection being pneumonia and
UTI. He also had air-fluid levels in his maxilary sinuses
concerning for sinus infection. Patient was intubated and
ventilated on admission. Wide-spectrum antibiotics were
administered as well as an anti-fungal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for possible fungal
infection in the setting of his immune supression. His hospital
course was complicated by oliguric renal failure and
pancytopenia with no response to antibiotics and supportive
therapy including IV fluids and blood products. On hospital day
6, in view of his end-stage underlying condition and the
development of multi-organ failure and in keeping with his
family's wishes goals of care were changed to focus on comfort,
patient was extubated and expired shortly thereafter with his
family at the bedside.
