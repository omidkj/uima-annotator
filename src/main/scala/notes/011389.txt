Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o with COPD, OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF
admitted with altered mental status secondary to hypercarbic
hypoxic respiratory failure.

# Hypercarbic Hypoxic Respiratory failure: Mrs [**Known lastname 65259**] was found
to be profoundly agitated and confused, incomprehensible to her
daughter even in Farsi. Her altered mental status was have some
contribution from hypoxia due to pulmonary edema. She remained
afebrile, without an elevated white count through out her
hospital stay, and no evidence of pneumonia was recognized on
CXR. She was found to have significant pulmonary edema. The
patient was placed on a lasix gtt then transitioned to IV
boluses. She developed a contraction alkalosis and hypokalemia
with lasix therapy, and required repletion with potassium
chloride. Clinically she has improved with respect to her
respiratory status, her 02 sats remaining in the high 80s to low
90s on mask ventilation during the day and bipap at night. She
is maintaining these sats on Nasal Canula 02. She continues to
have a permissive hypercarbia, but she is mentating well and her
oxygenation status remains goog. Her CXR shows evidence of
decreased fluid overload. She was delirious during her stay,
required haldol in addition to her antipsychotics for treatment
of her schizophrenia, however her mental status has noew
improved back to her baseline. She will continue on lasix 120mg
po daily X 2 days. She should then restart her home dose lasix
of 80mg daily.
.
# Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus Bacteremia - The patient was
found to have 4/4 bottles with CNS. She was placed on vancomycin
with a planned 14 day course. The patient has no systemic signs
and symptoms of infection. Follow up surveillance cultures were
negative.

#  DM2: She was managed with her glyburide and sliding scale
insulin.
