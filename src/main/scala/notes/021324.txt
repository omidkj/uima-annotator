Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 89 yo Russian-speaking only woman w/ a h/o DM, HTN, CAD
s/p 3-vessel CABG, and OA who was admitted [**2190-10-7**] for RLQ pain
[**1-9**] perforated appendicitis with a periappendiceal abscess.  Pt
started on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Abscess was drained
percutaneously and a RLQ pigtail cath was placed on [**10-8**] by
IR.[**10-8**] pt triggered for hypoxia and tachycardia on floor and
was transferred to SICU. CXR showed worsening pulmonary edema.
While in SICU experienced episodes of Afib and fluid overload.
Nephrology and Cardiology were consulted.  Pt was rate
controlled and diuresed with improvements in breathing.  She
received multiple modalities of repiratory support in the SICU.
Pt was transferred back to hospital floor when breathing and
sats improved on [**10-10**].  Cardiology recommended anticoagulation
in adidition to rate control based on pt's afib and thoracic
aorta thrombus noted on CT scan.  Pt was advanced from NPO to
clear liquids [**10-10**], but coughed, raising concerns for
aspiration. Pt's oral and pharyngeal swallowing were evaluated.
Pt also developed L 3rd toe pain and erythema on [**10-13**] and
Rheumatology determined it to be gouty arhthritis.  Pt's
symptoms and pain improved t/o hospitalization.

Pt's course has been complicated by elevated Cr (1.3 on
admission, up to 1.7 on [**10-10**],
now back down to 1.3; ? contrast-induced nephropathy) and
continued pulm edema (team has been giving free water through
IVF (due to pt's mental status) and lasix; her pulm status has
been improving).  Echo showed EF 30-35%.
