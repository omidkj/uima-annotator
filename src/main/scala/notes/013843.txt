[**12-10**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal(LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
[**12-10**] LE U/S: Nonocclusive thrombus identified at the junction of
the left
common femoral vein and the left greater saphenous vein. No DVT
seen in the remainder of the veins of both legs.
[**12-12**] LE U/S: Some progression of the non-occlusive thrombus at
the junction of the left greater saphenous and common femoral
veins. An additional non-occlusive thrombus is identified today
at the junction of the right femoral vein and deep femoral vein.
No occlusive thrombus identified in the remainder of the deep
veins of both legs.

 OPERATIVE REPORT
[**Month/Year (2) **]:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D. [**MD Number(1) 3186**]
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral femoral vein deep venous
thrombosis.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral femoral vein deep venous
thrombosis.
OPERATION PERFORMED:
1. Ultrasound-guided puncture of right common femoral vein.
2. Introduction of catheter into inferior vena cava.
3. Inferior vena cavogram.
4. Placement of Bard G2 IVC filter.
ASSISTANTS:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 20425**], PA and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3636**], MD.
[**First Name (Titles) 76605**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] TIME:  1.3 minutes.
CONTRAST USED WAS:  22 mL of Visipaque.
TOTAL INTRASERVICE CONSCIOUS SEDATION TIME:  8 minutes.
PATIENT IDENTIFICATION:  This is a 68-year-old gentleman who
had previously undergone a coronary artery bypass grafting
who was found to have a common femoral vein thrombosis. He
was found to have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Subsequently he developed a pulmonary embolus and was found
to have a right deep and superficial femoral vein DVT. Based
on these findings and the progression of the clots on
argatroban, the patient was consented for IVC filter
placement.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained,
the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed
supine on the angiography table. Both groins were shaved,
prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Conscious
sedation with fentanyl and Versed in divided doses was given
and maintained throughout the case. Continuous hemodynamic
monitoring was maintained throughout the case. Ultrasound was
used to identify the right common femoral vein. It was patent
and easily compressible without evidence of thrombus. Real-
time visualization of needle puncture into the right common
femoral vein was accomplished with a micropuncture set. Hard
copies of the images stored in the patient's chart for
documentation purposes. A 4-French sheath was placed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7648**] wire into the right common femoral vein and this is
followed with an Omni Flush catheter at the iliac
bifurcation. Injection of contrast through the sheath showed
no evidence of thrombosis within the right ileal to common
femoral venous system. Injection of contrast within the
inferior vena cava showed no evidence of caval thrombosis.
Caval diameter was 20 mm there by assuring that there was no
[**Last Name (un) 2432**] cava. Bilateral single renal veins were identified at
the level of L1 body. Once we were satisfied with the
anatomy, a Bard G2 filter was brought into the field,
introducer set was placed over wire and exchanged for the 4-
French Omni Flush catheter and the 4-French short sheath. The
sheath was placed into position over the junction of L2 and
L3 and the IVC filter was deployed in this position. Post
deployment fluoroscopy confirmed the upright placement of a
Bard G2 IVC filter in good positioning without evidence of
kinking. Once we were satisfied, the sheath was removed and
hemostasis was achieved via direct compression for 10
minutes. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present throughout the entire case.
ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
1. Patent right common femoral vein.
2. No evidence of DVT within the right ileal to common
    femoral venous system.
3. 20 mm diameter inferior vena cava.
4. No evidence of vena caval stenosis or thrombosis with
    patent bilateral renal veins.
5. Accurate deployment of an inferior vena cava filter,
    Bard G2 type, femoral approach over the junction of L2
    and L3 in the inferior vena cava.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
after diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism. Argatroban had been
initiated at outside hospital and was continued. He was also
started on Coumadin after 48 hours at a therapeutic PTT on
argatroban. Lower extremity U/S revealed nonocclusive thrombus
at the junction of the left common femoral vein and the left
greater saphenous vein. Vascular and Hematology were consulted
on [**12-12**]. Later on [**12-12**] he was brought to the operating room
where a IVC filter was placed.  He was transferre
