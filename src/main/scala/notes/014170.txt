THIS IS A DISCHARGE SUMMARY ADDENDUM

On [**2167-5-12**] the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy
with extended lysis of adhesions, an open cholecystectomy, a
common bile duct exploration, a choledochoscopy, and an
intraoperative cholangiography, and a choledochoduodenostomy.
A stone was found in the ampulla and pushed through
intraoperatively.  No residual stones were seen on the
choledochoscopy or intraoperative cholangiogram.  Please see
dictated operative note for further details.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and intraoperative and
postoperatively was placed on 5 mg of metoprolol intravenous
q 6 hours.  Postoperatively the patient was noted to have a
magnesium of 1.3 which was repleted.  The patient complained
of pain postoperatively as she did for the majority of her
stay.  She received 2 mg of intravenous Dilaudid plus 1 mg of
subcutaneous Dilaudid which helped with her pain.  On
postoperative day one the patient was noted to have crackles
on the left and clear lungs on the right but she continued to
report abdominal pain.  She was placed on p.r.n. Dilaudid and
the dose was increased to 2 mg subcutaneous q 2 hours.  The
patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] placed intraoperatively which was
serosanguinous and remained so until it was pulled on
postoperative day seven.  A nasogastric tube was placed
postoperatively because of the choledochoduodenostomy.  The
nasogastric tube was ultimately removed on postoperative day
six.  Later on postoperative day one the patient experienced
a temperature to 101.9.  Her incision was clean, dry and
intact with no erythema and the patient had no further
temperature spikes.  The patient reported no flatus
indicating a lack of bowel function up until postoperative
day six when the nasogastric tube was actually pulled.  On
postoperative day two the patient was switched from lactated
Ringer's to maintenance intravenous fluids.  They reported
some occasional abdominal pains but was overall much better
than the prior days.  Her liver function tests were normal
with an AST of 39, an ALT of 30, an alkaline phosphatase of
101 and a total bilirubin of 0.3.  On postoperative day four
the patient reported an increase in her abdominal pain and
she began to experience late expiratory wheezes.  The patient
also showed a low urine output the previous day and required
fluid boluses to maintain her urine output.  The patient was
started on albuterol nebulizers for her wheezes.

On postoperative day five the patient continued to have
wheezes with shortness of breath.  The patient was given a
dose of Lasix to help diurese her.  Later that day the
patient had a four beat run of ventricular tachycardia.  A
set of electrolytes were drawn which were normal except for a
magnesium of 1.4 for which she got 3 grams of magnesium
sulfate.  A cardiology consult was also obtained.  The
patient ultimately ruled out by enzymes but it was
recommended by cardiology that the patient continue to be
diuresed, that the patient be started on aspirin, that
Lipitor be started, and that Lisinopril be started.  The
patient had not been previously treated for her mildly
depressed ejection fraction or her coronary artery disease
indicated on her earlier P-MIBI.  On the following day,
postoperative day six, the patient had continuing shortness
of breath, and her intravenous fluids were stopped.  At this
time the patient reported no abdominal pain.  She did have
wheezes.  On postoperative day seven the patient continued to
have expiratory wheezes bilaterally and having tolerated a
clear diet the previous day after nasogastric tube was pulled
out, she was begun on a regular diet.  TPN was also begun on
postoperative day six and continued into postoperative day
seven with a 1 liter starter solution.  Early on
postoperative day seven the patient's Dilaudid PCA was
stopped and the patient was begun on oral Percocet.  However,
later in the day the patient was having poor pain control and
was transferred to P.O. Dilaudid with acetaminophen.  When
this failed to control the patient's pain she was started on
intravenous Dilaudid.  However, the patient did not receive a
dose of intravenous Dilaudid.

She was found at 4 PM unresponsive with eyes closed and no
response to painful stimuli.  Her pupils were equal, round,
reactive to light.  She had wheezes bilaterally but oxygen
saturations at 95 percent and a heart rate of 100 and blood
pressure 168/100.  The patient awoke approximately 30 minutes
later with no residual neurological deficits.  However, the
patient immediately complained of her ongoing abdominal pain.
A blood gas was not obtained during the episode but one was
obtained in the intensive care unit which was pH of 7.26, CO2
of 54, oxygen of 165.  It  was felt in retrospect that the
patient did not have a seizure or cerebrovascular accident
but that instead she suffered from CO2 retention secondary to
her splinting.  It was also felt that she was fluid
overloaded during the course and she was therefore
transferred to the intensive care unit.  Extra doses of Lasix
were given.  The patient was diuresed extensively and
intravenous metoprolol was stopped as this was thought to be
possibly a confounding factor leading to her wheezes.  The
patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells to
bring her hematocrit just above 30.  An EKG done at the time
of the event on postoperative day seven showed no acute
ischemic changes.  The TPN was also stopped in the intensive
care unit along with levofloxacin that had been given for 12
days to treat a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray.
The patient was transferred back to the floor on
postoperative day eight and on morning of postoperative day
nine had no shortness of breath or abdominal pain.  She had
only slight crackles bilaterally on her chest examination and
was doing quite well, tolerating a regular diet.  The patient
was continued on Lasix 20 intravenous per day but received no
additional intravenous fluids.  The patient's pain was also
well controlled on acetaminophen with P.O. Dilaudid.  As the
patient was doing well she was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in the afternoon of postoperative day nine.
