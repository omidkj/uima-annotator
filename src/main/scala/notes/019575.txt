HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He is a 69-year-old man with
COPD dependent on oxygen at home and steroids, question type
2 diabetes, question insulin dependent.  He was transferred
from the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with hypotension, new ST
elevations in the inferior leads.  The patient had a
prolonged ICU course at the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital initially
admitted on [**2198-6-8**].  He was found unresponsive and
dehydrated with blood sugar in the 30's.  He was intubated
and treated for right middle lobe, right lower lobe
pneumonia.  He was noted to have a new intermittent left
bundle branch block on [**6-27**].  First CPK at the time and
troponin were negative and no work-up was done at the time
for his left bundle branch block.  We had difficulty weaning
the patient off of the intubation and so he was given a
tracheostomy and a PEG tube on hospital day 11 there and
treated as well for a COPD with Solu-Medrol converted to
Prednisone.  He was found to have MRSA in his sputum and was
treated with Vancomycin and Unasyn and then was discharged to
a rehab unit, [**Hospital1 **], on [**6-27**].  The patient was
doing well, however, still trach and vent dependent.
However, he was noted to have dark stool and a hematocrit
around 25.  He was transfused two units of packed red blood
cells.  CPK and troponin were checked and the first set was
found to be negative, second set to be positive.  The patient
was readmitted to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2198-7-8**].  His first
CPK was 243 with an MB index of 15.6, troponin greater than
50.  He was started on Heparin drip.  He was also guaiac
positive.  He was found on EKG to have an intermittent left
bundle branch block with a white blood cell count of 12.4 and
no reported fevers.  However, chest x-ray was negative but
leukocyte esterase and many bacteria were found on the
urinalysis.  Central line which was a month old on the right
subclavian side, was changed over a wire at the [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital.  No antibiotics were started.  On [**2198-7-14**], in the
morning the patient was noted to have chest pain, systolic
blood pressure to the 70's with new ST elevations in 2, 3,
and AVF.  CPK was greater than 730 and MB index was 11.7.  He
was made comfortable with Morphine Sulfate.  White blood cell
count was found to be 30.6 with gram negative rods in his
urine.  Blood pressure did not respond to intravenous
therapy.  He was started on Dopamine drip and transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for a possible
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for COPD on home O2 and
chronic Prednisone, type 2 diabetes mellitus, question of
insulin dependent,  his reason for starting on insulin was
unclear.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer from the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital were
Heparin drip, Dopamine drip at 5 mg/kg per minute, Prednisone
20 mg po q day, Regular insulin sliding scale with Fentanyl
patch at 20 mcg per 72 hours transdermally, Zolpidem 5 mg po
q h.s., Pericolace 30 mg po bid, Reglan 10 mg po qid,
Lansoprazole 30 mg po bid and Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No current cigarette use, probably in the
past.  Denies ethanol use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Currently negative.  On admission had no
chest pain or shortness of breath, no nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain and no complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient's examination
was consistent with a 99.1 temperature, 125/81 blood
pressure, on the Dopamine drip, pulse 84, respiratory rate of
28, saturation of 100%.  CVP 11 and 12.  He was on IMV 650 by
10, total volume of 500 and 50% O2 saturation, 5 of PEEP, ABG
7.39, 50 and 102, Lactate 1.1, calcium ionized at 1.06.  In
general is trach'd, is arousable and did not respond well to
questions.  Normocephalic, atraumatic, head anicteric, pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light, dry mucus membranes.
He had no JVP, trach was in place.  There was tenderness at
the site of the subclavian tunneled catheter.  Lungs were
consistent with coarse breath sounds at the bases.  The
patient had distant heart sounds, normal S1 and S2, no
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, non distended,
non tender with positive bowel sounds.  He had no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  His extremities were cool and
diaphoretic.  His rectal exam showed guaiac positive.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 20.2 with diff of 90.9
neutrophils, 0 bands, 4.6 lymphocytes, 29.3 hematocrit,
platelet count 313,000, MCV 89.  Coags 15.0 PT, 84.3 PTT and
a 1.6 INR.  SMA, 142, 4.1, 104, 29, 29 BUN and creatinine
0.5, 275 glucose, calcium 7.5, magnesium 2.3, phosphorus 3.2,
albumin 2.5, CPK was 691, MB 81, MB index 11.7, troponin
greater than 50.  Urinalysis was positive, nitrite negative,
leukocyte esterase, 5 reds, 14 white blood cells and moderate
bacteria.  Blood culture times two were sent.  Sputum culture
times one was sent.  Urine culture times one was sent and
were all pending at the time of admission.  EKG on [**6-27**] found
a left bundle branch block pacing at 100.  On [**7-13**] this showed
sinus rhythm at 78, normal axis, anterior Q's in V1 through
V2, no ST elevations in V4 or the right sided leads.  On [**7-14**]
there was a left bundle branch block at [**Street Address(2) 28717**] elevations
in the inferior leads. Chest x-ray showed no CHF, question of
cardiomegaly, right upper lobe and right lower lobe
infiltrates

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He had a central venous line placed, a
right four lumen catheter was put in and in addition:
1.  Cardiovascular:
A) Coronary artery disease:  His CPK again were found to have
ruling in for myocardial infarction.  He was evaluated and
the EKG was consistent with an anterior myocardial
infarction.  Cardiology consult was requested and it was
determined that since he had been at least 18 hours into a
completed anterior infarction, no medical management was
indicated, no PTI was indicated at the time.  He was
maintained on Aspirin and Heparin.  The patient did not have
a PA catheter placed and the patient was maintained on that
regimen.  He was started on Warfarin eventually and patient's
Heparin was weaned off after several days.  On [**7-25**] with the
atrial fibrillation, DC cardi
