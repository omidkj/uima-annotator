This is a discharge summary addendum to the previous addendum
from [**2139-1-6**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2139-1-6**], the patient was noted to have
some bleeding at the tracheostomy site and 100 ccs of blood
from the nasogastric tube after the patient had pulled the
tube twice and it was replaced.  On that same day, the
patient had repeated episodes of epistaxis, was evaluated by
ENT by laryngoscope, visualized an abrasion in the left
posterior pharynx, only seen with scope.  ENT noted bleeding
should stop on its own.  The next day the patient received
one unit of packed red blood cells.  Hematocrit did not
increase appropriately.  ENT was called back for the repeated
bleeding, removed nasogastric tube, inserted a Foley catheter
into the left naris and inserted 17 ccs within the balloon
which immediately controlled bleeding from oropharynx.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 954**] with cardiothoracic surgery who inserted the
tracheostomy evaluated the tracheostomy and did not suspect
that bleeding was from tracheostomy site.  It appeared to be
coming from above.  On [**2139-1-6**], the patient had a
thoracentesis of two liters of serosanguinous fluid from the
right lung base consistent with transudate, probably due to
congestive heart failure; however, the patient's low albumin
may have contributed to this effusion.  Posttap chest x-ray
showed improvement in lung fields and pleural effusion. The
patient evaluated by speech.  The patient was unable to
phonate.  Possible laryngeal cord edema, trauma, limiting
ability to aerate.  Should be evaluated follow-up by ENT for
laryngeal cord injury, paralysis.  The patient did not have a
swallow evaluation with the bloody secretion prior to the
balloon tamponade, not viewed appropriate at that time.  Will
evaluate for swallow evaluation possibly Monday prior to
discharge.  The patient worked with physical therapy and
making good progress.  Would benefit from one to three times
a week physical therapy sessions.  On [**2139-1-7**], a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was placed by
gastroenterology without complications.  On [**2139-1-9**], called
to see the patient for cellulitis.  On the neck, area
erythematous, blanching to pressure.  The patient was started
on Vancomycin as on [**2139-1-2**], had a MSSA culture around
tracheostomy site, had deferred antibiotics at the time as
the patient was afebrile with no symptoms, however, given the
new cellulitis, started the Vancomycin as the patient has a
Penicillin allergy.  Would recommend a course of ten days as
long as the patient continues to improve.  The patient was
seen by chest surgery who placed the tracheostomy and agrees
with the above plan.  [**Month (only) 116**] want to add coverage if not
responding.  The patient also had some bleeding around the
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy which cleared with a
lavage through the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.
The patient had problems with intermittent bradycardia but
was asymptomatic and otherwise vital signs were stable.  Also
problems with constipation, last disimpacted [**2139-1-10**], with
good effect, and tolerated tracheostomy mask on [**2139-1-9**], for
five hours and placed back on pressure support [**9-13**] and 40%
with good saturation at 96%, volume 330.  Tracheostomy mask
reattempted [**2139-1-10**], pending at this dictation.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE: (Addition)
1.  Vancomycin one gram intravenously q12hours times ten
days, started on [**2139-1-10**].
2.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. three times a day, hold for heart
