CHF BIBA after calling 911 for several months of increasing LE
edema x2months and concerns that he was not doing well at home
w/ lightheadness, DOEx4days, disorientation. Upon further
questioning he does note DOE x4days and several weeks of dark
malodorous loose stool with intermittent BRBPR in the toilet

resolved. States he has had a colonoscopy and EGD previously at
[**Hospital1 2025**], does not know why, states he does not remember being told
anything was wrong. Denies ETOH use, occasional Aleve use. Of
note, he states his VNA stopped checking his blood levels about
1 month ago. He continued to take his coumadin as previously
instructed (1.5pills/day, unknown dose). Denies F/C/CP/SOB at
rest/N/V/hematemesis, diaphoresis. Noted LE edema has worsened
over the last 2 days.

In the ED, initial VS were Temp 98 HR 148 BP 98/58 RR 15 sat
100% 3LNC. He was noted to be pale appearing and tachycardic
with guaiac positive black stool on rectal exam. Labs were
significant for a hct of 12.8 (last noted to be 37.4 in [**2121**]),
hgb 3.6, INR 14.2, plts 216, Cr 2.7 (last noted to be 1.2 in
[**2121**]) with a BUN of 73, Bicarb 20, glucose 216, trop 0.07,
lactate 1.3, LFTs normal, Alb 3.6. Repeat Hct 1.5hrs later was
stable at 12.4 prior to PRBC transfusions. Blood cultures were
sent. ECG showed afib with RVR (HR120s) and poor baseline. CXR
showed mild cardiomegaly, clear lungs without acute process.
Patient received 1 liter NS with improvement in his SBP from 80s
to 100s and HR from 140s to 120s. Patient was ordered for 4PRBCs
ad 3 units FFP, however only the first unit of FFP had been
completed prior to transfer. Patient was receiving the second
unit of FFP on arrival and had not received any PRBCs. He
received pantoprazole 40mg IV and vitamin K 10mg IV. GI was
consulted and plans to do EGD and colonoscopy early this week,
when hct is >25 and INR is therapeutic. Admitted with a presumed
diagnosis of subacute lower GI bleed. VS on transfer HR 120-130
BP94/60 rr16 100% RA.
