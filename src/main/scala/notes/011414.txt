HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 79
year-old woman who was admitted from [**Hospital3 26615**] Hospital
where she was originally seen on [**10-18**].  The patient had
presented to the outside hospital with symptoms of an upper
respiratory infection, loss of appetite and inability to talk
and feeling weak.  In the Emergency Room at the outside
hospital the patient went into respiratory distress, became
hypotensive and unresponsive.  The patient was intubated and
ventilated and a dopamine infusion was started.  The patient
then went into atrial fibrillation and supraventricular
tachycardia, which did not respond to Adenosine, but did
improve with a Cardizem bolus.  At the outside hospital the
patient was also noted to have greatly elevated transaminase
and had chalk liver.  She was also noted to have an elevated
creatinine and there was a question of acute renal failure.
At the outside hospital sputum and blood cultures grew out
pneumococcus.

Laboratory values at the outside hospital showed a white
count of 6.7, hematocrit of 42, BUN 49, creatinine 2.1, SGOT
of 1101, SGPT of 660, T bili of 1.5.  She had a CT of the
head, which showed microvascular white matter ischemia and od
lacune of the head of the left caudate, but no recent infarct
or bleed.  She had a chest x-ray, which showed a right upper
lobe pneumonia, question right hilar fullness with small
right pleural effusion.  Electrocardiogram showed no acute
changes and nonspecific ST changes in the anterolateral
leads.  The patient was stabilized and a course of Levaquin
was started at the outside hospital.  The patient was given 2
units of fresh frozen platelets for an increase in INR and
three doses of vitamin K.  The patient did have some
transient decreased urinary output at the outside hospital.
The liver function tests were initially elevated and did show
a downward trend and tube feeds were started.  The patient at
the outside hospital showed overall improvement except for a
platelet value, which decreased to 36,000.  The patient was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital on [**10-23**]
for further management to the Medical [**Month/Year (2) 15593**] Care Unit on
the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Question of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  The patient states that she stopped
smoking three years ago.  Status post corneal transplant,
glaucoma, status post appendectomy, discontinuing tobacco
three years ago.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Baseline medications, at baseline the patient
was using only Atrovent and Albuterol prn.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 **] HOSPITAL:
Dopamine drip, Penicillin 2 grams intravenous q 6, Levaquin
250 mg q.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d., Albuterol and Atrovent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO [**Hospital1 **]
HOSPITAL:  Temperature 98.  Pulse 89 sinus rhythm.  Blood
pressure 104/58.  Respiratory rate 12.  The patient was
intubated, sedated and was being ventilated.  Her left pupil
was 2 mm and reactive to light.  The right pupil was 8 mm and
not reactive to light.  She was noted to have bilateral
cataracts.  She had decreased breath sounds at the right
axilla and the left base of the chest.  Her cardiac
examination revealed a normal S1 and S2 with normal sinus
rhythm.  The abdomen was mildly distended and soft.  Breath
sounds were decreased.  There was a large demarcated
ecchymosis on the right groin area.  Examination of the
extremities revealed ecchymotic extremities, which are
edematous.  She had no pedal edema.  Her limbs were warm.
Pulses were present.  The patient at the time was responding
to loud voices and painful stimuli and moving all four limbs
equally.  She had at that time several central lines, Foley
catheter, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube.

Physical examination on [**11-2**] the date of transfer to the
medical floor revealed that the patient was afebrile.  Her
blood pressure was 155/80.  Pulse 90.  Respiratory rate 33.
Pulse ox was 96% on a 50% face mask.  She was oriented to
person only.  Her right pupil was reactive to light.  Her
left pupil was post surgical.  Her smile was symmetrical.
Extraocular movements were full.  Her tongue was midline.
Facial sensation was intact.  Strength was 4 to 4+ out of 5
throughout except in the left upper extremity where the
patient was unable to elevate the arm against gravity and
noted also to have weakened dorsal interosseal on that side
as well.  Cardiac examination revealed no murmurs.  A
slightly tachycardic rate.  No JVD was noted.  There was not
noted to be lymphadenopathy.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The leg site was clean, dry and
intact.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender with positive bowel
sounds.  There was no noted to be peripheral edema.

DATA:  CBC at the time of admission showed a white count of
8.9, hematocrit 33.7, platelet count of 86.  Pleural fluid
analysis from [**10-25**] revealed white blood cell count of 720,
red blood cell [**Pager number **], polys 69, lymphocytes 5, monocytes 0,
basophilia 3, macrophage is 23.  Chem 7 from the time of
admission showed sodium 140, potassium 3.5, chloride 108,
bicarb 22, BUN 51, creatinine 1.5, glucose 93.  Further
pleural fluid analysis on [**10-25**] showed a total protein of
1.6, glucose 88, LDH 246, amylase 55, ALT 471, AST 214, CK
27, alkaline phosphatase 134, total bilirubin was .3 on
[**10-23**], albumin 1.8, calcium 7.5, phosphate 3.8, magnesium
1.3.  On [**11-2**] at the time of transfer to the medical floor
laboratories were as follows, white count 11.9, hematocrit
33.5, platelets 392, sodium 144, potassium 3.3, chloride 100,
bicarb 34, BUN 28, creatinine 0.6.  Repeat liver function
tests on [**11-10**] showed an ALT of 76 and AST of 44,
alkaline phosphatase of 201, T bili of 0.8.  Many blood gases
were performed during the course of this admission.  The
interested reader should refer to the chart directly for more
details regarding the patient's respiratory status, however,
on repeat measure the pH arterially varied between 7.2 and
7.44.  C-diff toxin was performed multiple times with the
last being on [**11-15**] returning as negative all times.

Multiple blood cultures were sent with no growth to date.
Urine was sent on [**11-12**], which showed Vancomycin
resistant enterococcus sensitive to chloramphenicol.  Further
samples were consistent with this as well.  Chest x-ray
performed [**10-23**] at the time of admission showed right upper
lobe collapse and consolidation and fullness of the right
hilum, right upper lobe collapse may be consistent with post
obstructive change, medical correlation required.  Follow up
chest x-ray was performed multiple times and most recent at
the time of this dictation being [**11-9**] with the following
impression, improved appearance of the chest, residual small
pleural effusions.  A CT of the chest was performed on [**10-24**]
with the following impressions, dense area of consolidation
primarily affecting the right lung as above, multi focal
areas of ground glass opacification within the left lung
consistent with multifocal pneumonia.  The patient with known
pneumococcus pneumonia.  There is no evidence of an abscess
cavity.  There are bilateral pleural effusions right greater
then left.  There were no suspicious loculated components
based on the supine CT scan.  Hypodense lesion within the
right lobe of the liver that is indeterminate.  Small amount
of ascites.  Endotracheal tube.

impression, no evidence of acute intracranial pathologic
process.  CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on [**11-10**]
