Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26965**] is a 65 year-old male
with end stage renal disease and peripheral vascular disease
admitted on [**6-11**] originally to the Vascular Service for
elective left below the knee amputation due to nonhealing
ulcers.  Mr. [**Known lastname 26965**] has a history of multiple vascular
interventions on his left leg including femoral distal bypass
in [**2114-4-8**], but has a chronic pain and a nonhealing
ulcer on his left foot, which has failed conservative
therapy.  With the exception of his pain Mr. [**Known lastname 26965**] felt well
on admission.  He denies fevers or chills, chest pain,
shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for end stage renal disease
secondary to ANCA vasculitis.  The patient was hemodialysis
since [**2112**].  The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes
since [**2093**].  The patient has a history of peripheral vascular
disease as noted above including previously mentioned left
leg interventions as well as amputation of fifth metatarsals
on his right foot.  The patient has a history of congestive
heart failure with an echocardiogram in [**2115-3-8**]
showing a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40 to 45%,
right ventricular dilatation and mild pulmonary hypertension,
as well as mild global right ventricular hypokinesis.  The
patient has a history of atrial fibrillation status post
cardioversion.  The patient has a history of hyperthyroidism,
hypertension, history of previous cerebrovascular accident,
history of throat cancer status post chemotherapy and
radiation therapy, history of MRSA bacteremia, history of
GERD.  History of chronic aspiration pneumonias status post
PEG placement.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to Hydralazine to which
he developed a vasculitis.  Cipro to which he gets swelling,
ace inhibitors to which he gets swelling and Vancomycin to
which the patient gets hives.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin, which was initially on
hold for surgery, subQ heparin, Levofloxacin 250 mg po once a
day, which was begun on [**6-12**] for aspiration pneumonia, Epogen
1300 units subQ once a week, Serevent two puffs b.i.d.,
Levothyroxine 200 micrograms po q day, quinine sulfate 325 mg
po Monday, Wednesday and Friday prehemodialysis, Norvasc 5
grams Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, 5 grams twice a day
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.  Lopressor 25 mg po
twice a day.  Calcium carbonate 4 grams po twice a day.
Flovent 110 micrograms three puffs b.i.d., Claritin 10 mg po
once a day and Percocet prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for a forty pack year smoking
history.  The patient quit smoking in [**2103**].

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  The patient had a white count of
6.4, hematocrit of 28.7, which is around baseline for the
patient.  His INR was 1.4.  PTT was 36.3 and his BMP was
within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was afebrile
with a temperature of 98.8, pulse 74, blood pressure 136/62,
sating 94% on 2 liters O2.  Generally, he was cachectic ill
appearing male in no acute distress.  He had no JVD, but his
lungs were remarkable for bibasilar rales.  Cardiovascular is
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  Abdominal
examination was benign with the PEG site being clean, dry and
intact.  Extremities left lower extremity was bandage with
the bandage being clean, dry and intact.  No edema.  Chronic
venostasis changes.  Right lower extremity had no edema and
also had evidence of chronic venous changes.  Left AV fistula
had palpable thrill and a good bruit.

IMPRESSION:  In short, this was a 65 year-old male with end
stage renal disease and peripheral vascular disease and a
myriad of other medical problems that was admitted for
elective left below the knee amputation secondary to
nonhealing ulcer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Vascular:  The patient underwent left
below the knee amputation as planned on [**6-12**] and was doing
well postoperatively until [**6-16**] when he began having mental
status changes.  Workup of the mental statue changes is
discussed in the endocrine section below.  The patient's
wound did not heal well and became necrotic, gangrenous and
thus the patient was taken back to have his below the knee
amputation revised to an above the knee amputation on [**2115-6-26**].  Postoperatively the patient's wound healed well
and at the time of discharge was clean, dry and intact with
no erythema and no exudate.

2.  Endocrine:  The patient is a known type 2 diabetic who
was taking Micronase at home that was discontinued on
admission, because the patient was NPO for surgery.  The
patient's sugars were fine postop until he began having
mental status changes on the 9th where he became lethargic,
noninteractive with his family, narcotics were discontinued
without results and blood sugars were noted to be in the low
40s to 70s.  Review of medications revealed that the patient
had been given Glyburide due to a nonupdated medication sheet
brought from home.  Blood sugars remained in the 20 to 80
range.  The patient despite boluses with D50 was started on a
D10 drip.  His sugars were maintained within normal limits.
Unfortunately Glyburide does not clear the system with
dialysis, so the patient was maintained on a D10W drip with
D50 boluses needed throughout the course of the next three
days while waiting for Glyburide to clear his system.
Subsequent to weaning the patient off of the D10 drip he was
maintained on standing doses of NPH insulin and with sliding
scale.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient was afebrile throughout
the course of his hospital stay until [**6-26**] when he spiked
a temperature.  Subsequent blood cultures grew MRSA.  Because
the patient's allergy to Vanco he was started on Synercid.
The patient underwent a TTE to rule out endocarditis, which
showed no vegetations.  He also had another positive MRSA
blood culture on [**7-2**] after the placement of a PICC line.
The PICC line was removed after subsequent catheter tip
culture grew MRSA positive.  The patient remained afebrile
with negative blood cultures from MRSA for the remainder of
his hospital stay and was sent home for an add two weeks of
Synercid.  The patient also had a positive blood cultures,
which grew B fragilis.  The source for this was thought to be
the sacral decubitus ulcer.  The patient was started on
Flagyl po for this and given a two week course per ID
recommendation.

4.  Cardiac:  The patient had a history of atrial
fibrillation, but was in normal sinus rhythm on admission.
Throughout the course of his stay he had episodic atrial
fibrillation, but remained hemodynamically stable.  The
patient was restarted on his Coumadin prior to discharge with
hopes of titrating him back to a therapeutic level.  The
patient is followed by his nephrologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**].

5.  Sacral decubitus ulcer:  During the course of his
hospital stay due to his prolonged immobilization
postoperative and while being in the Intensive Care Unit the
patient developed severe sacral decubitus ulcer stage 3 to 4,
which required multiple debridement by plastic surgery while
he was in house.  Because the patient's peripheral vascular
disease it was thought that the patient is probably not a
good candidate for flap reconstruction.  The patient was
referred to general surgeon Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for follow up
and further debridement of this wound as an outpatient and
continued on wet to dry dressings three times a day.

6.  Pulmonary:  The patient had a history of chronic
aspiration pneumonias and had difficulty being weaned from
oxygen as an inpatient.  Thus he was treated with a short
course of Levofloxacin while in house even though his chest
x-ray remained clear without signs of pneumonia during the
course of his stay.  The patient was also continued on his
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease inhalers and oxygen
prn.

7.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient
continued G tube feeds throughout the course of his st
