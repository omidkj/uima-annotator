Shortness of breath

PICC line placement (Right)


History of Present Illness:
61 yo male with hx AML, s/p 7+3 induction chemo with idarubicin
and cytarabine (Day 1=[**2149-11-23**]), complicated aspergillus
pneumonia tx with voriconazole. Also, pt found to have a newly
depressed EF to 30-40% with focal hypokinesis. He had a left
heart cath that found 3VD and had 3 BMS placed to LAD, 1
proximal and 2 to the mid LAD on [**2149-12-24**]. The pt was discharged
on [**2149-12-26**] on aspirin and plavix. He now presents with a chief
complaint of chest pain starting this morning.
.
This morning he felt "cold and clammy" and he had suddent onset
of chest pain. He describes the pain as dull/pressure, focused
in the center of his chest, [**7-7**]. It was non-radiating and
associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath, but no
dizziness, palpitations, nausea or vomiting. Of note, he had
similar chest pain several months ago while raking leaves (pain
resolved on its own at that time). He called 911 and was taken
by the ambulance to the [**Hospital6 **]. CP resolved at OSH
with nitro and morphine. Trop T was elevated to 0.12 and EKG
showed no ischemic changes. He had a CTA showing no PE. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. In our ED, initial
vitals were T 96.2 HR 99 BP 105/73 RR14 SaO2 97%. He was given
vancomycin and zosyn, and blood cultures were sent. Also given
tylenol 650mg x 1. CEs were trending up.
.
Per nursing report prior to transfer the patient became
hypotensive and tachycardic when standing up. He was bolused
500cc and placed in a supine position.  On arrival to the floor
his vitals were T 100.7, HR 114, BP 108/65, SaO2 99% on 2L. He
denied any chest pain or pressure but did report feeling unable
to take a deep breath and feeling intermittent chills/rigors
throughout the afternoon. Additionally, he reported dysuria
starting this morning. He denied GI sx or productive cough. He
was given 1 liter NS, then given demerol for the rigors and his
BP dropped to 90s. He was started on a 3rd liter and his BP
improved. His temp increased to 102. His EKG showed some mild
STE vs J point elevation changes in the anterior leads,
cardiology felt it was not consistent with a instent thormbosis.
He was transfered to the unit for sepsis.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
He denies GI sx, no hematuria or prior dsyuria other than today,
no cough, no vision changes, no neck stiffness. Had a mild HA
today. Has a tender right wrist (where cath was done).

Pertinent Results:
EKG:  sinus tach at 135, STE vs j point elevations in V2-V4,
qwave in III (ST changes are new from ER EKG)
.
TTE [**2149-12-23**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to hypokinesis of the
anterior septum, inferior septum, anterior free wall, lateral
wall, and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2149-11-19**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further reduced.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2149-12-24**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was
not
present. There were separate ostia for the LAD and LCx. The LAD
had a 60-70% proximal eccentric lesion, a total occlusion of the
mid-LAD and a 50-60% lesion of the diagonal branch. The LCs had
a 40% stenosis in a large OM and a 60-70% stenosis in the
smaller distal LCx into the OM2. There was a large patent ramus.
The RCA was 100% occluded proximally. The PDA and PL filled by
left to left collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure of 96/73 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and placement of a 3.0x12mm Vision bare-metal
stent in the proximal LAD and overlapping 2.5x23mm and 2.5x12mm
Mini Vision bare-metal stents in the mid LAD were performed.
Final angiography showed normal flow, no apparent dissection,
and no residual stenoses. IVUS showed good stent apposition.
(See PTCA comments.)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Placement of bare-metal stents in the LAD.

CT abd/pelvis w/ and w/o contrast:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. No focal abscess or
overt
infection in the abdomen or pelvis.
2. Interval development of bilateral moderate pleural effusions
with
compressive atelectasis, left greater than right. Area of focal
consolidation vs mass in the left upper lobe as previously
identified is not encompassed by today's study, however, is
evident on scout radiograph.
3. Multiple bilateral sub-4 mm pulmonary nodules are better
demonstrated on prior CT from [**2149-12-13**].
4. 9-mm hypodense liver lesion is too small to fully
characterize but likely represents a cyst. Focal fatty
infiltration in anterior left lobe of liver.
5. Trace pelvic fluid, a non-specific finding.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo m with hx of AML, s/p 7+3 induction chemo c/b presumed
fungal pneumonia treated with voriconazole, and reduced EF
(30-40%), CAD s/p PCI with BMS x3 in LAD([**2149-12-24**]) who now
presents with chest pain and fevers/tachycardia.
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis/tachycardia: Pt had SIRS criteria, new
leukocytosis and rigors on admission. Pt has known lingular
opacity seen on prior imaging last week, as well as OSH imaging
that confirmed this finding that in the past was thought to be a
Aspergillus infection, since the Ag was positive and B-glucan
was present.  He denies GI sx, however, did have C. diff
infection on [**2149-12-2**], and just completed flagyl 2 days prior to
infection.  Also had mild hypotension concerning for sepsis at
the time of admission.
