Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, s/p L3 laminectomy/discectomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L3 laminectomy/discectomy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 62201**] is a 67 year-old woman with Diabetes mellitus, end
stage renal disease on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, coronary
artery disease, and known L4-5 disc herniation who presented
with right leg weakness, increased back pain, and worsening disc
protrusion at L3-4. Immediately after a fall at [**Hospital **] rehab
one day prior to admission here, patient experienced increased
back pain with radiation down her leg and more difficulty moving
her right leg.
.
Evaluation at [**Hospital6 2561**] included an MRI which showed
worsening L3-4 disc protrusion. She also demonstrated some
myoclonus/asterixis on exam and received some iv ativan (amount
unclear). She was then transferred here for emergent
neurosurgical evaluation.
.
Exam in the ED here notable for decreased rectal tone and
decreased sensation in the medial thigh. She had leg weakness
more prominent on the right side, some decreased sensation on
right leg in an L3-4 distribution, and absent DTRs in the RLE.
MRI revealed 1)Epidural hematoma extending from L2-L3 level to
L4-L5 level resulting in marked mass effect on the thecal sac
and as a result, compression of the nerve roots. 2) Moderate
disc bulge at L4-L5 resulting in moderate stenosis of the spinal
canal at that level. 3) Small disc herniation at L5-S1 level
does not appear to cause significant spinal stenosis. There are
bilateral facet degenerative changes at these levels which
resulted in severe left sided neural foraminal narrowing.
.
Pt underwent emergent L3 laminectomy/discectomy [**4-12**] given
concern for cauda equina syndrome. She remained intubated and
was monitored overnight in the ICU. After dialysis removing 2L
followed by successful extubation to CPAP with weaning to nasal
cannula oxygen supplementation, pt was transferred to the
medicine service in stable condition.
