History of Present Illness:
67 yo M c h/o stage IIIB IgG kappa multiple myeloma d+24 auto
SCT who was discharged [**2118-5-30**] and presented to clinic [**2118-6-6**]
with increasing dypnea and productive cough since discharge from
BMT service 1 week ago.   He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 31775**]
with fever, felt [**2-4**] pneumonia on CT chest, described as patchy
b/l infiltrates.  He was treated with Vanc/Cefepime, and d/c'd
to completed a 14-d course of Levaquin, set to finish [**2118-6-8**].
He states his cough has actually improved since d/c, but his
dypnea, especially on exertion, seems worse.  He denies fever,
chills, chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria, or trauma.  Pa/L
CXR today revealed improvement in his infiltrates.  He has a h/o
pituitary adenoma s/p resection and adrenal insufficiency.
Initial vitals in clinic were T 97.4, BP 138/80, HR 94, RR 20,
and 94% on room air.  He was noted to be wheezing on exam, and
desatted to 89% with ambulation.  While in clinic, he received
100mg IV SoluMedrol, 1 albuterol inhaler, 1L NS, and 2L O2 by
nasal cannula, with some improvement in his dyspnea.

CXR pa/l: Improvement in the patchy densities seen in both lung
bases, particularly on the left side. Minimal residual patchy
density persists
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly limited examination due to large amount of motion
artifact, however no evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary
embolism to the subsegmental level.
2. Interval worsening of RML abutting fissure opacity may
represent worsening consolidation or atelectasis. No significant
interval change to other patchy peripheral opacities and
peribronchial wall thickening. Differential remains infectious
including viral etiologies or atypical bacterial pneumonias.
.
ECHO [**2118-6-7**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular systolic function with
impaired left
ventricular relaxation. No structural valvular disease or
pericardial
effusion.
.
ECG: Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Rightward axis.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2118-5-9**] no definite change


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo M c stage IIIB IgG kappa multiple myeloma d+27 of auto SCT
presents with worsened SOB.
.
# Hypoxia/SOB: Initial w/u negative for worsening PNA (no fever,
CXR and CT showed improved appearance of prior infiltrates, and
cough was improved since last admission).  He completed his
final 2 days of levofloxacin for his prior PNA. Cardiac cause
was investigated with BNP, echo and CXR, and there was no
evidence of heart failure (patient did not improve with IV
lasix).  His hypoxia worsened significantly over the first 24
hours of hospitalization, and he eventually required
non-rebreather with 100% O2 and ICU admission.  CTA was negative
for PE.  He was emperically treated with stress dose steroids.
Since he had received Melphalan induction during stem cell
transplant, toxicity was suspected.  Treatment for Melphalan
toxicity is high dose steroids, and the patient improved
dramatically with this. He was continued on Hydrocort 100 q8
when called out of the ICU, which was changed to 40mg PO BID.
He was continued on albuterol and atrovent nebs while
hospitalized.  Plan is for outpatient steroid taper by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 1557**].
.
# Multiple myeloma:  s/p auto SCT, when he received Melphalan.
Pt was not neutropenic.  He will continue on prophylaxis for PCP
with Bactrim while on increased dose steroids.
.
# h/o pituitary adenoma s/p resection/adrenal insufficiency.
He was continued on his outpatient dose of testosterone patch
and synthroid.  Steroids were increased as above, and pt to be
d/c'd on Prednisone 40 [**Hospital1 **], which will be tapered as outpatient.
.
# Meningioma: S/p excision [**3-/2118**] and XRT. Is being followed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] as outpt. No further w/u needed while inpt.
.
# DM II - Not on oral regimen or insulin at home, but placed on
insulin SS while on steroids.  Pt has regular insulin at home
and knows how to follow a sliding scale, which he will use upon
discharge.
.
# FEN: regular diet
# Ppx: SC heparin while in ICU, then ambulatory, PO diet, bowel
regimen
# Code: Full
