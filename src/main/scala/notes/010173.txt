CXR  [**2134-10-4**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-27**],
there is again enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis and pulmonary edema.

EEG: FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: The posterior waking background was generally of

moderate voltage and in the [**3-28**] Hz range. Anterior rhythms were
lower
with mixtures of theta and delta. Some eye movement artifact was
seen.
BACKGROUND: The anterior-posterior voltage gradient was
preserved. No
frank epileptiform discharging was seen.
HYPERVENTILATION: Not performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Not performed.
SLEEP: Not obtained.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrhythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to a slowed and disorganized
posterior
background with predominant theta rhythms. This record was
diffusely
abnormal and suggestive of a mild to moderate diffuse
encephalopathy.

CT HEAD: IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
acute major vascular territorial infarction.

ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the basal to mid septum and inferior segment
and severe hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall. The
other segments are mildly hypokinetic.. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Regional akinesis and mild
global hypokinesis. Dilated, depressed right ventricle. Moderate
to severe tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

LIVER U/S: FINDINGS: Liver architecture appears diffusely
echogenic. No focal lesion identified within the liver. There is
no evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. Patient is status post cholecystectomy. Common duct
is seen measuring approximately 7 mm. No free fluid is seen. The
right kidney measures 10.1 cm. The left kidney measures 12.2 cm.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones. 5.2-cm rounded
hypoechoic structure with through transmission seen in the left
kidney, consistent with a cyst. The spleen appears enlarged
measuring upwards of 16.1 cm. Limited views of the pancreas head
appear grossly unremarkable, though assessment of the body and
tail are limited by abdominal gas. Moderate right pleural
effusion is noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration, other
forms of liver disease, including more significant forms of
liver disease such as hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be
excluded. No focal lesions are identified within the liver.
2. No evidence of intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. Status post cholecystectomy.
3. Small moderate of right pleural effusion.
4. Left renal cyst.
5. Splenomegaly.

EGD: Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Other
procedures: A 20FR percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) was
placed successfully using standard techniques at the stomach
body.
Impression: PEG placement.
Recommendations: PEG can be used for medications today and for
feeding starting tomorrow. Dry sterile dressing can be placed
OVER bumper- to be changed once daily x 1 week. I will loosen
external bumper slightly tomorrow prior to discharge.

ERCP: Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the es
