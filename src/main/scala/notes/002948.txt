Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and coccygeal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. bedside debridement of right ischial necrotic tissue [**2105-8-11**]

History of Present Illness:
67-year-old man with paraplegia (as a result of an inflammatory
spinal cord process of unknown etiology), a chronic indwelling
Foley catheter, and a known sacral decubitus ulcer was evaluated
on an outpatient basis on [**8-1**] and was found to have a
leukocytosis (WBC 14K); Staph aureus was cultured from his
sacral decub.  Cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily was started.
Despite this intervention, he remained febrile, and he began
having yellow drainage from his ulcer.  He was therefore brought
to the ED on [**8-10**].  There, he was hypotensive (80s/60s).  Blood
and urine cultures were drawn, dexamethasone was given, empiric
vanc, levoflox, and flagyl were started, and 3.6 liters of fluid
were infused.  He was admitted to the ICU.

On further review of systems, the patient reports a history of
progressive night sweats with chills over the past 5-6 months.
He's also had a cough productive of increasing amounts of white
sputum for the two months PTA.  He has limited sensation but has
felt increased pain in his sacral decub recently.  His
left-sided, burning chest pain, right-sided abdominal pain, and
R>L shoulder pain all started with the onset of his paresis and
have progressed steadily since then.

Blood pressure promptly returned to the range of the patient's
relatively low baseline with early goal directed therapy.  He
was admitted to the ICU under the sepsis protocol but required
ICU-level care for less than 48 hours.

Fevers are most likely due to sacral osteomyelitis.  Bone scan
non-diagnostic, but suggestive of osteomyelitis.  MRI likely not
possible due to IVC filter; would confirm this with radiology.
Since we can probe to bone on physical exam, then the diagnosis
becomes increasingly likely.  Referred to orthopedics consult
for bone biopsy and discussion of possible ulcer debridement.
Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin were started pending biopsy.
Continue aggressive wound care.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: Goal INR [**3-14**].  Warfarin currently being
held.  Anticipate resuming it today; will need to monitor INR
closely on combination of warfarin and cipro.

4. Asthma: Continue advair and albuterol.

5. CAD: ASA, simvastatin

6. CHF: Monitor fluid status and respiration; if flashes in
context of fluid loading for sepsis protocol diurese.

7. Depression: continue citalopram.

8. Back Pain/Chronic Pain: Continue Dilaudid, baclofen, and
gabapentin.

9. FEN/GI: On HH diet. Replete lytes as indicated.

10. PPX: Bowel regimen, anti-coagulation with coumadin, PPI.

11. Communication: Patient declines to name family members or
other persons who could make decisions on his behalf or be
contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding this admit.

12. Code: Full-discussed admit, no advanced directives or HCP.

13. Access: RIJ CVC (presep) placed in ED [**8-10**], R AC PIV.

14. Dispo: Pending osteomyelitis work-up.

Past Medical History:
1. Inflammatory disease of the spinal cord of uncertain
etiology.  MRA [**10-15**] negative for vascular malformation.  Initial
CSF analysis showed elevated protein (82) without oligoclonal
bands.  NMO blood titer negative, RPR negative, Lyme serology
negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, Ro and La negative, ACE level normal,
neuromyelitis IgG negative, ESR 70, CRP 66.8.  Ultimately
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids (two
weeks of Solu-Medrol followed by a prednisone taper), and 5 days
of mannitol without improvement.  He is followed by neurology
for a dense paraplegia (T4) with neuropathic pain, restrictive
shoulder arthropathy, and a neurogenic bladder requiring a
chronic indwelling foley.
2. Chronic sacral decubitus ulcer, previously treated with a VAC
dressing
3. Multiple UTI (including Pseudomonas)
4. Pulmonary embolus [**11-14**] s/p IVC filter placement
5. Asthma
6. Two-vessel coronary artery disease s/p CABG 4-5 years ago
7. Systolic CHF (EF 25-30% on [**2-15**] TTE)
8. Repaired liver laceration
9. Chronic back pain
10. Vitiligo
11. Feeding tube
12. Depression
13. MRSA from sacral swab and sputum
14. Prior transient episodes of leg paralysis
15. Right frontal lobe brain lesion biopsied [**11-14**] and c/w
gliosis; resolved on repeat imaging
16. Abnormal visual evoked potentials

Social History:
He moved here from [**Country 3594**] (after living in many different
countries) in the [**2068**].  He is retired from a job in the
maritime industry.  Divorced 24 years ago.  Three children.
Quit smoking [**2076**].  Quit drinking [**2080**].  No history of illicit
drug use or abuse.
