Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-4-2**]  emergency replacement ascending/hemi arch aorta/AVR

History of Present Illness:
53 yo male with unknown PMH, with likely no regular medical
care, had epigastric pain for the past few days. It became more
severe this AM, and a co-worker drove him to an ER at an OSH. He
became unresponsive during the car ride. Taken from the car into
the ER in full PEA cardiac arrest.While in ER, he received full
ACLS, CPR x 17 minutes, epi, atropine, bicarb. Intubated and
placed on a ventilator.TEE revealed Type A aortic dissection
with flap prolapsing into LV and wide open AI. EF was 55%
without tamponade. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:

No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The ascending aorta is markedly dilated A mobile density is seen
in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal flap/aortic
dissection. A mobile density is seen in the aortic arch
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. A mobile
density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an
intimal flap/aortic dissection.

Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname 34699**]
[**Known lastname 7474**] at 13:40

Post_Bypass: Milrinone 0.5 mcg/kg/min, epinephrine
0.05mcg/kg/min

Left ventricle has very severe dysfunction less than 5% EF.
Right ventricle has severe dysfunction.
Ascending aorta intact. Aortic prosthesis is well positioned
with peri or para valvular leaks.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to CVICU and evaluated by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as well as the
neurology team for help assessing neuro status which was could
not be determined. Taken to the OR for TEE where he was severely
acidotic, with a mixed venous sat of 15.Echo showed poor cardiac
function, and he was hypoxic. Decision made for surgical salvage
attempt, and he underwent emergency replacement of ascending and
hemi arch aorta/AVR.Unable to be weaned off cardiopulmonary
bypass, despite maximal pressor support, bronchoscopy and
pulmonary consult. Expired in the OR at 18:50 PM. Medical
Examiner declined the case.
