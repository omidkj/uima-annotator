History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 yo male with multiple vascular risk factors
including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
peripheral vascular disease, CAD s/p MI s/p CABG, myelodysplasia
who was found unresponsive in bed by his wife on the morning of
presentation. He was recently discharged from the vascular
surgery service on [**2110-7-3**] after having a transmetatarsal
amputation of the left foot for severe PVD. Since his discharge,
he had been doing remarkably well. He went to bed on the night
prior to admission as usual and appeared completely normal to
his wife. The next time she saw him was 9:00 AM (she does not
sleep in same room) when she attempted to wake him for breakfast
in bed. He did not wake up so she left the breakfast by the bed
and left the room. She came back about an hour later and he had
not yet woken up to eat. She thought this was unusual and more
vigorously tried to awaken him. He was unresponsive. She said
that his eyes were "wandering around" and that he was gurgling
on what apeared to be vomit. She called 911. EMS arrived to find
him unresponsive with "shallow breathing". He was intubated in
the field and he was initially brought to [**Location 17065**] ER. He
arrived there at 11:15AM. His HR was 113 BP 171/95. He was
unresponsive on arrival, but was noted to occasionally reach for
ETT with his right hand. He was given 1mg of Ativan for unclear
indications. He was also given lasix 60mg IV and Cardizem 20mg
for tachycardia. He had a head CT which showed a large stroke
with a question of hemorrhagic transformation and he was
tranfered here for further mangement.

When he arrived at the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, he remained unresponsive,
occasionally moved right arm spontaneously. ER course here was
notable for episode of junctional tachycardia which responded to
Cardizem.

CT SCAN (from OH)-limited study, shows large area of hypodensity
with edema in the R MCA distribution, with mass effect on the
lateral ventrical and slight shift (5mm). There are several
areas of hyperintensity within the right frontal lobe suspicious
for hemorrhage. There is also a hypodense area in the left
caudate and int capsule. ? heterogenous appearing surrounding
area suspicious for evolving infarct. Hyperdense R MCA sign

CT Head ([**2110-7-6**]): Appearance of MCA stroke, shift and edema
unchanged, two areas of hyperintesity in the right frontal lobe
(2mm) that may represent petechial hemorrhage within the
infarct. These have not progressed from the last CT scan. The
left BG hypodense area is again seen-? evolving infarct.

CT HEAD ([**2110-7-7**]): There has been interval progression of the
large right- sided middle and anterior cerebral artery
infarctions, with severe edema, mass effect, and contralateral
shift of normally midline structures. There has been progression
of subfalcine herniation since the prior study. There are
several prominent foci of hyperdensity anteriorly, likely
representing hemorrhagic transformation, the largest of which is
approximately 2cm in size. The contralateral ventricle is
dilated, likely due to obstruction at the level of the foramen
of [**Last Name (un) 2044**].

IMPRESSION: Marked interval worsening of cerebral edema, mass
effect, and subfalcine herniation secondary to the large right
anterior and middle cerebral artery infarctions. Multiple areas
of interval hemorrhagic transformation.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially started on a mannitol drip.  The
neurosurgery service was consulted and recommended no surgical
intervention given the grave prognosis.  His condition was
unchanged from admission on the morning of the second hospital
day, roughly 24 hours after he was initially found unresponsive.
 A family meeting was held with the patient's wife and children
to discuss goals of care.  They had initially decided to pursue
all measures possible to sustain the patient's life despite the
poor prognosis.  Later in the afternoon of the second hospital
day, the patient's nurse discovered a large and unreactive pupil
on the right on routine neuro check.  The neurology and
neurosurgery teams were called to evaluate the patient and this
finding was confirmed.  A repeat CT scan of the head was
performed which demonstrated an increase in the size of the
infarction in the right hemisphere with increased edema,
worsened subfalcine and uncal herniation.  Another family
meeting was held to readdress goals of care given the turn of
events.  It was eventually decided by the patient's wife and
children to shift the goals of care to focus on the patient's
comfort.  He was extubated and all medications with the
exception of a morphine gtt were discontinued.  The patient
passed away at 11pm on [**2110-7-7**].  A post-mortem
examination was declined by the patient's wife.
