Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure, transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation prior to arrival, extubation
Central venous line
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 82019**] is a 75 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CAGB in
[**2121**] and PCI in [**2136**] with an EF of 25% who is being transferred
after being admitted to an OSH with CHF.
.
Per OSH records, patient presented on [**12-6**], via EMS, to the OSH
with shortness of breath.  After being treated with IV lasix he
decompensated with respiratory failure (7.26/51/60) requiring
intubation.  Diuresis was continued though limited by an
elevated creatinine and an EF of 10%.
.
During the hospitalization, an echo was done and showed an EF of
10% along with 3+MR.  Dopamine was started along with levaphed.
Given concern for PNA, broad spectrum antibiotics were started.

.
[**2137-12-9**] ECG: [**Month/Day/Year **] fibrillation with premature beats, probably
ventricular, after which on one occasion there is a ventricular
paced beat. Marked left axis deviation. Intraventricular
conduction delay of right bundle-branch block type. ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
[**2137-12-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of
prior chest radiographs:
Patient has had median sternotomy, transvenous right [**Month/Day/Year **]
pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads follow
their expected courses from the left axillary pacemaker. ET tube
and NG tube in standard placements. Right subclavian line ends
at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  Mild pulmonary
vascular congestion is present. Opacification in the left lower
lobe could be atelectasis or pneumonia, with similar
abnormalities though less severe on the right lower lung. No
pneumothorax. Pleural effusion if any is minimal, on the left.
Heart moderately enlarged.

.
[**2137-12-10**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
right atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal akinesis of the inferior and
inferolateral walls, and hypokinesis of the mid to distal
anterior wall and apex. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot
be excluded with certainty. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severely dilated left
ventricle with regional dysfunction consistent with multivessel
coronary disease. Mild right ventricular dilation and
dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate to severe pulmonary
hypertension.
.
[**2137-12-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study earlier in this
date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.
The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion appears to have
increased. Atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, though
supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded. The right central
catheter has not definitely identified. Pacer device with two
leads remains in place.
.
[**2137-12-12**] Cardiac Catheterization 1. Three vessel coronary artery
disease.
2. Mild to moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Patent LIMA, SVG to OM, and SVG to PDA.
4. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension
.
[**2137-12-12**] CXR:
Since yesterday, ETT and nasogastric tube end in expected
position.
Dual-chamber pacemaker defibrillator is in unchanged position.
Cardiomegaly is stable.
Bibasilar alveolar opacity persists but decreased. Interstitial
edema improved. There is no other change.
.
[**2137-12-14**] CXR:
Compared to the prior study, there is no significant change in
the ET tube, NG tube, pacemaker, and retrocardiac opacity. There
is no new infiltrate.
.
[**2137-12-16**] Transesophageal Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
[**Month/Day/Year **] pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with
severe hypo/akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and
mild-moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
25-30 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
