Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
PLANUM SPHENOIDAL MENINGIOMA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**6-27**]: Lt Craniotomy for Mass Resection


History of Present Illness:
61-year-old female who is well-known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from previous
outpatient visits and outpatient complications. The patient has
been followed longitudinally in the brain tumor clinics for a
recently-diagnosed skull base lesion. The patient had shown
progressive neurological deterioration of her vision, and was,
therefore, felt to be a candidate for surgical decompression
albeit the degree of compression of the optic nerve from the
diagnosed lesion remained unclear. The patient was extensively
counseled. The patient was consented. The patient was taken
electively to the operating room.


Past Medical History:
MENINGIOMA, HYSTERECTOMY [**2101**], GLAUCOMA, INSOMNIA, DEPRESSION
ASTHMA

Social History:
non-contributory

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
On Discharge:
AOx3, with a left [**Year (4 digits) **] field deficit, that is unchanged from
pre-op. PERRL, EOMS intact. Face symmetric, tongue midline. No
pronator drift. Strength is full throughout in upper and lower
extremities. Incision is clean, dry, and intact, without
erythema, or drainage.

IMAGING:
MRI (Head)[**2120-6-27**](post-resection):
FINDINGS: A comprehensive evaluation of the brain was not
performed with this study, which was targeted for pre-operative
planning. There is a homogeneously enhancing extra-axial lesion
arising from the left paramedian planum sphenoidale, medial to
the pre-chiasmatic segment of the left optic nerve, unchanged
since the previous study. It measures 6 mm AP x 5 mm transverse
x 3 mm craniocaudad. There is no evidence of optic nerve
displacement, although high-resolution imaging of the
suprasellar region was not performed. There is an ill-defined
subcentimeter enhancing lesion in the left centrum semiovale,
unchanged dating back to [**2119-6-20**] (series 5, image 19, and
series 4, image 22). Based on its signal characteristics on
previous complete head MRIs, it may represent a vascular
malformation such as a capillary telangiectasia.
IMPRESSION:
1. Small extra-axial mass arising from the left paramedian
centrum semiovale is again demonstrated for pre-operative
planning. It is most compatible with a meningioma.
2. Unchanged ill-defined contrast-enhancing lesion in the left
centrum
semiovale, most likely representing a vascular malformation such
as a
capillary telangiectasia.

CT Head [**2120-6-26**]:
FINDINGS: In the region of the sella is amorphous hyperdense
material (70
[**Doctor Last Name **]) in the expected location of the pituitary gland. The
presence of
hyperdense material in this region is concerning for pituitary
hemorrhage.
Additional possibilities include hemorrhage from adjacent
vessels into this region or retained Surgicel or other surgical
packing material. No other areas concerning for acute hemorrhage
are present. Patient is status post left frontal craniotomy with
a small volume right and moderate volume left frontal
pneumocephalus and possible packing material along the left
frontal convexity, causing mild degree of sulcal and gyral
effacement. There is no shift of normally-midline structures.
Ventricles and sulci appear unchanged in size or configuration
compared to pre-operative MRI examination. There are no foci
concerning for acute territorial ischemia.
Surgical staples are noted along the left frontotemporal scalp
with underlying subcutaneous emphysema in the soft tissues, not
unexpected post-surgical finding. Osseous structures are
otherwise intact. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid and ethmoid air
cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Hyperdensity in the sella in the region of the pituitary
gland, concerning for pituitary hemorrhage. Alternative
diagnoses include hemorrhage from adjacent vessels into this
region or retained surgical packing material. No other findings
concerning for acute hemorrhage are present.
2. Bifrontal pneumocephalus, left greater than right. Left
frontal
pneumocephalus causes mild sulcal and gyral effacement. There is
no shift of midline structures and no herniation.
3. Left frontal craniectomy with overlying subcutaneous gas in
the soft
tissue.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service electively
for a meningiom resection. She had no complications in the OR
and went to the ICU post-operatively. The following day the
patient had nausea and vomiting as well as a severe headache.
Her pain medications were adjusted and she was given
antiemetics. Her nausea resolved and her headache improved. The
patient was then transferred to the neurosurgical floor on [**6-27**].
Her post-op MRI showed no infarction and the resection appeared
to be complete. On [**6-28**] the patient had some drainage from the
incision so there were staples added to the wound closure. The
patient remained neurologically stable and physical therapy felt
that she was safe to be discharged to home. She was discharged
with her family on [**2120-6-29**].
