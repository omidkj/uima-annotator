Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 28286**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Cardiac catheterization
2. Intra-aortic balloon pump placement


History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with no prior cardiac history presents with weakness
and hypotension, found on catheterization to have
infero-posterolateral MI. Patient woke up feeling weak this AM,
but was able to drive a friend to work. His feeling of weakness
continued in the context of having a bowel movement x 2. When
family member found him, he was profoundly weak, and EMS was
called. When EMS arrived, patient was found to be hypotensive to
SBP 60s. There was no chest pain, dyspnea or back pain. He did
feel lightheaded and presyncopal. He got IVFs en route with
improvement in his SBP to 100s.
.
In ED, initial VS were: HR 101 BP 102/78 RR18 O2Sat 98% room
air. ECG showed ST elevations in the inferior leads, with ST
depressions in the anterior precordial leads, suspicious for
acute inferoposterior MI with possible RV infarct. Patient was
found to have troponin to 0.20, as well as lactate of 2.8. He
was sent to the cath lab, patient had DES placed in RCA. Left
main was also found to have significant stenosis, and DES was
placed there as well. In addition, the LAD and one diagonal also
found to have significant disease, but stents were not placed.
Status post cath, patient had IABP placed due to pulmonary
hypertension. In cath lab, patient was given 20 mg IV Lasix with
gentle IVFs, putting out 1.5L urine upon arrival to the floor.
He developed respiratory distress, which is attributed to flash
pulmonary edema. Patient also got plavixloaded, and was started
on ASA325 and Integrellin drip, with plan for 12 hours of
integrellin.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient's VS were: T 98.9, HR 93, BP
137/72, RR 26, O2 sat 94 (12L). He was not in mild respiratory
distress with minimal accessory muscle use. He denied chest
pain, dyspnea, or pain/discomfort anywhere in his body.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

TTE ([**1-31**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal inferolateral dyskinesis and akinesis of
the mid-inferolateral wall and basal 2/3rds of the inferior
wall. The distal septum and distal anterior wall are severely
hypokinetic. The apex is mildly dyskinetic. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Dilated
ascending aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7049**] is a 69M with PMH of hypertension and hyperlipidemia
who presents with posterior-inferior STEMI, s/p cath with DES to
RCA and LMCA and intra-aortic balloon pump.

Active Diagnoses:
# STEMI: Patient had a posterior-inferior STEMI s/p cardiac cath
with 2 DES placed, one to RCA, one to LMCA (because patient was
hypotensive). He has no known cardiac history, but has a hx of
pulmonary hypertension and a IABP was inserted through femoral
artery. Initial TTE demonstrated EF 40%, left ventricular
hypertrophy, and regional systolic wall motion abnormality
consistent with CAD.  There was dyskinesis of RV and LV apex
with small pericardial effusion. Anticoagulation was initially
held to prevent hemorragic conversion of pericardial effusion.
He was started on atorvastatin 80mg and when blood pressures
allowed, metoprolol 12.5 PO BID and lisinopril 5mg PO daily.
Eventually, he was started on coumadin for LV dyskinesis.  He
will take ASA 325 mg PO daily for 1 month (then 81mg daily after
that) and clopidogrel 75 mg PO daily for 1 year s/p load of
clopidogrel 600 mg PO x1 as duel antiplatlet therapy.  Patient
was also started on lasix 40mg PO daily for volume management.

# Hypotension:  Cardiogenic shock from MI. Patient was quickly
weaned off pressors on HD2
