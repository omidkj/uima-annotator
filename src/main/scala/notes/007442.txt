History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25971**] is a 77 y/o female with a history of severe COPD on 2L
home oxgyen who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with
progressive shortness of breath, cough and fatigue. She was
initially seen by her PCP's coverage on [**2146-3-11**], at which time
she was complaining of a cough productive of white sputum and
worsening shortness of breath. At that time she denied any
fever/chills, n/v/d, sick contacts, but was complaining of
wheezing. During that visit a CXR was done that did not show a
pneumonia, so she was started on azithromycin for presumed
bronchitis and encouraged to use her spiriva daily as she had
not been using this regularly. By report she did not start the
azithromycin for unclear reasons, and presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
with worsening shortness of breath.
.
A CXR was done with no evidence of pneumonia, however she was
tachycardic, tachypneic with an elevated lactate, troponin of
0.054, so she was given solumedrol 125mg, zosyn, started on
bipap and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On
arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] her initial VS were: 98.9, 145, 156/104,
28, 95% on CPAP. Here her labs were notable for a white count of
18.9 with 2% bands, bicarb of 36 and lactate of 3.2. Her
antibiotic coverage was broadened to include vancomycin/zosyn
since she lives at an [**Hospital3 **] facility. She was
initially observed on bipap, however there was concern that with
her rapid respiratory rate she would tire out, so an ABG was
done on bipap with an FiO2 of 35% that was 7.29/80/73. After
that she was intubated due to her hypercapnia and continued
tachypnea, post intubation on propofol her blood pressures
dropped into the 100's systolic. Vital signs prior to transfer
to the ICU were: 98.9, 123, 108/60, 14, 98% on AC 12x380.

ECHO [**3-16**]:
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
CXR:
HISTORY: Worsening shortness of breath and productive cough.
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-20**], the endotracheal
tube and
nasogastric tubes have been removed. Continued hyperexpansion of
the lungs
consistent with prominent emphysema. No evidence of acute focal
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 year-old female with a history of end-stage COPD on 2L NC at
home who presented with severe COPD exacerbation, s/p intubation
and successful extubation.
.
#. COPD Exacerbation:  Patient has severe COPD at baseline and
is O2 dependent on 2L with baseline sats 90-92%.  In the ICU,
patient was treated for COPD Exacerbation with steroids, nebs,
and azythromycin for bronchitis.  She failed an extubation
attempt on [**3-15**] and was sucessfully extubated on [**3-20**].  She was
also given 2 doses of 10 mg IV lasix to improve her repsiratory
status, although echocardiogram showed no evidence of heart
failure. She completed a five-day course of prednisone and
azythromycin on [**3-20**].  On the floor, her respiratory status
remained stable with oxygen saturations in the mid-90s on [**3-3**] L,
which is her baseline.  She was maintained on
albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and her home dose of advair
250/50.  Home tiotropium inhaler was held while she was
continued on ipratropium nebulizers.  She does take theophylline
at home; however, due to transient episodes of tachycardia, was
held during the admission.  On discharge, the ipratropium was
discontinued and her tiotropium was resumed.
.
#. Sinus Tachycardia: Patient continued to have sinus tacycardia
in the 120s with ventricular trigemeny while in the ICU and on
the floor. Her heart rate increased with nebs or movement.  The
rhythm was sinus, occassionally ventricular trigemeny,
alternating with sporadic PVCs.  Going back on her records,
patient has been baseline tachycardic 110s-120s for several
years. Echo on [**3-16**] did not show any evidence of structural
heart disease.  On discharge, heart rate had returned to
baseline 100-110s.
.
#. Depression: Continued venlafaxine.
.
#. Osteoporosis: Continued on home calcium/vit d3.
