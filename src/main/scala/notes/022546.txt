Dyspnea after elective intubation for Port placement

Chest Port placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47716**] is a 74 year-old male with hx of metastatic lung
cancer on 3L home O2 with a recent admission for RUL obstructive
PNA, who presented to [**Known lastname **] for port placement, and could
not lie flat without dyspnea.  He was intubated for his
procedure, and subsequently extubated with acute dyspnea and
agitation with an O2 sat of 79%.  A CXR demonstrated complete
conslidation of the R lung field.  He was intially placed on
BiPAP and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory distress.
.
In the PACU, initial vs were: T 97.8 P 110-120 R 15-21 100% O2
sat.  After NC the patient was placed on BiPaP and transfered to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was breathing comfortably on BiPAP with settings
at 8/5 with an FiO2 of 30% 94% sat, and a minute ventilation of
9.3.  he was immediately transitioned to NC at 5L and sating at
100%.  Per the patient he has had a productive cough, but denies
any hemoptysis, fevers, chills, nausea, emesis, or change in
bowel or bladder habbits.  He reported being thirsty, and was in
no pain.

He is DNR/DNI.  He explicity expressed not to be treated with
antibiotic therapy for his possible post-obstructive PNA, until
a discussion with his wife took place.

Past Medical History:
NSLC [**11/2128**] - diagnosed after antibiotics failed for a presumed
PNA.  CT staging demonstrated invasion of thoracic structures (L
atrium, SVC, and pericardium, right upper lobe bronchus), and a
biopsy from bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis.
Chemotherapy was started on [**2129-1-5**].
THERAPY: Cisplatin (50mg/m2, D1 and D8) and etoposide
(50mg/m2,D1-5)with concurrent radiation therapy.
[**2129-1-5**] Cycle 1 D1
[**2129-1-25**] Completion of 3500 cGy radiation therapy
[**2129-1-31**] Cycle 2 D1

Imaging:
CXR [**2129-9-6**] post Port Placement: FINDINGS: AP single view of the
chest has been obtained with patient in
supine position. Comparison is made with the next preceding
similar study of
[**2129-9-1**]. On the present examination, a complete white
out of the
right hemithorax has now developed. A new right central venous
line has been
placed apparently using the internal jugular approach on the
right side. The
line terminates overlying the lower mediastinum and most likely
has entered
the right atrium. Withdrawal of the line by approximately 5 cm
is
recommended. There is no evidence of pneumothorax in the
right-sided
completely dense hemithorax. Also on the left side no evidence
of
pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Goals of care: Palliative care saw the patient in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**];
the patient decided to be made CMO; all medications other than
Vicodin and pain regimen were discontinued.
.
# Acute respiratory failure, in setting of metastatic non-small
cell lung cancer: He was admitted with acute respiratory
failure, and finding of right lung consolidation that is likely
secondary to obstructive PNA.   Thoracentesis was considered for
a possible effusion radiographically confounded by infilitrate
on CXR but deferred, and overall after discussion with primary
oncology and family, decision was made to pursue comfort
measures, and stop antibiotics.  He was transferred out of the
ICU, and enrolled in inpatient hospice.  He was seen by
palliative care as well.  He was ultimately sent to the [**Hospital **] for ongoing palliative care/hospice.  At the time of
discharge, he was feeling well, no dyspnea or pain, and was
tolerating po intake with assistance.
.
#. NSLC with Metastasis: Possible chemotherapy for palliation
according to primary Hem/Onc team considered, then deferred.
Palliative care consulted.  Patient remained comfortable during
the remainder of his admission.
.
#. Malignant shoulder Pain: Known metastasis. Continued on home
regimen of Vicodin PRN in conjunction with a bowel regimen.
.
#. Anemia: Stable, but low relative to recent baseline.
Microcytic - raises question of underlying thalessemia.
Continued home Folic Acid.
