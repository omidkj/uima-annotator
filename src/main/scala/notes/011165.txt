Service:  Internal Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 43-year-old
gentleman with a history of chronic renal failure status post
renal transplant in [**2128**], on azathioprine and prednisone,
mesenteric ischemia status post inferior mesenteric artery
bypass in [**12-25**], status post brief admission to the intensive
care unit on [**2146-4-21**] to [**2146-4-23**] for fevers, hypoxia, and
hypertension.  The patient presented with fevers, chills, and
shortness of breath in the Emergency Department on [**2146-4-21**],
and was found to be mildly hypoxic with O2 saturations of 80%
and also hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the
70s to 80s.  Per the patient his baseline systolic blood
pressure runs from the 90s to 100s.

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral mid lung zone infiltrates.
He was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl, and
steroids, and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on 5 mcg of
dopamine.  In the intensive care unit the dopamine was weaned
and the levofloxacin and Flagyl were continued.  Bactrim was
added for possible Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  During
this time his steroids were started to be weaned.  One sputum
was collected and was negative for Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia x 1.  The patient then had a bronchoscopy with a
bronchoalveolar lavage with a Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
DFA pending.  When the patient was hemodynamically stable,
saturating well, and taking good p.o.'s he was transferred to
the [**Company 191**] for further observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Chronic renal failure secondary to
vesiculo-ureteral reflux status post renal transplant in
[**2128**].  2. Mesenteric ischemia status post internal mammary
artery bypass with 45-pound weight loss.  3. Ophthalmic
zoster.  4. Colitis with anal fistulae.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies..

MEDICATIONS:  Azathioprine 100 mg p.o. once daily;
multivitamin one tablet p.o. once daily; levothyroxine 200
mcg p.o. once daily; prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.o.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.2, pulse
70s to 80s; blood pressures 80s-110s/60s, saturating greater
than 95% on room air.  GENERAL:  He was a thin male in no
apparent distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:
Mucous membranes were moist.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  LUNGS:  He had rales at the
left mid to base.  His right lung was clear.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
scaphoid.  EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 7, hematocrit 26, platelet
count 385, sodium 138, potassium 2.6, BUN 108, bicarbonate
17, BUN 29, creatinine 1.1, glucose 108.

Chest x-ray revealed persistent diffuse airspace
consolidation in the left lung with partial resolution of the
consolidation of the right lower zone.  These findings are
consistent with viral pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After being transferred to the medicine
floor the patient was transfused with two units of packed red
blood cells which improved his hematocrit to 40.1.  His
prednisone was tapered to 10 mg every other day and he was
restarted on azathioprine.  Because his results were negative
for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Bactrim was discontinued.
He was continued on his levofloxacin, for which he will
finish a 14-day course.

His blood was sent for iron studies, which were pending at
the time of discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily for a total of 14
days.
2. Azathioprine 100 mg p.o. once daily.
3. Multivitamin 1 tablet p.o. once daily.
4. Levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. once daily.
5. Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.o.d.
6. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Folic acid 1 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient will return to the
emergency room if he develops recurrent fevers, chills, or
shortness of breath.
