Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2192-7-12**] and was
urgently taken to the operating room the following day, where he
underwent a CABG x2. Please see operative note for full details.
The patient tolerated this procedure well. Following surgery, he
was transferred to the CSRU for recovery. That night, the
patient acutely desaturated. A chest xray showed a right tension
penumothorax, and a chest tube was emergently placed. The IABP
was removed on post-op day #1. That day, the patient's LFT's
were found to be markedly elevated, and a hepatico-biliary
surgery consult was called. Work-up included a right upper
quadrant ultrasound, which revealed a few gallstones but did not
show evidence of cholecystitis, biliary tree dilation, or
enlarged common bile duct. The patient's transaminitis
eventually improved, and it was felt that, in the end, this was
most likely due to hemolysis secondary to IABP. On post-op day
#3, the patient was transferred to the floor. On post-op day #4,
routine chest xray demonstrated a persistent pneumothorax that
was refractory to chest tube suctioning. A thoracic surgery
consult was called, and a new chest tube was inserted. On
post-op day #5, repeat chest xray demonstrated an interval
increase in the pneumothorax, and the chest tube was replaced by
thoracic surgery. On post-op day #7, the decision was made to
undergo doxycycline pleurodiesis. On post-op day #10, chest xray
showed near resolution of the patient's pneumothorax. The chest
tube was removed, and the patient was discharged home in stable
condition.
