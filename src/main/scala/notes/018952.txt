Service:  [**Company 191**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old Russian
speaking man with a history of COPD on home O2, bronchiectasis,
hypertension, CHF with an EF of 20-25% with 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], CAD,
who presents with increased shortness of breath, lower extremity
edema for 1-2 weeks with acutely increased shortness of breath
and tachypnea on the night before admission.  The patient
measured his blood pressure at home and it was elevated to
200/100.  He became anxious over this elevated blood pressure and
his dyspnea worsened.

He denied chest pain, palpitations, fever, chills, or rash.
Denied any dietary noncompliance.  He reports that he has not
taken his Lasix for "months", and he also reports that his DuoNeb
had recently been D/C'd and he was on Atrovent alone.

EMS was called, who found him to have a respiratory rate of 20,
heart rate of 107, blood pressure of 200/100, and satting 89% on
2 liters with basilar wheezes.  In the Emergency Department, he
was started on a nitro drip and given 40 IV of Lasix with
initially good urine output of 1 liter for a presumed CHF
exacerbation.  He, however, then subsequently developed
increasing tachypnea and he was started on BiPAP for increasing
pCO2 respiratory distress with decreasing respiratory rate.  ABG
on face mask before BiPAP was instituted was 7.20/112/62. EKG
showed tachycardia with AFib versus Aflutter, and was therefore
admitted to the ICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD on home O2 of 2 liters and in [**September 2115**], he had a
FEV1 of 0.98.
2. Right lung nodule.
3. CHF:  Echocardiogram in [**2-10**] showed an EF of
approximately 20% with 2+ MR and 2+ TR.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Russian speaking gentleman, lives with his
wife.  [**Name (NI) **] a 40 pack year tobacco history and no alcohol
abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.0, heart rate 106,
blood pressure 126/69.  In general, he was awake and alert,
and answered questions appropriately through an interpreter.
Neck examination:  Jugular venous pressure was obscured by
the BiPAP mask.  Lung examination:  He had decreased breath
sounds throughout with absence of breath sounds at the left
base.  No wheezes and few basilar crackles.  Cardiovascular
is tachycardic with frequent ectopy.  He had a normal S1, S2
and positive S3.  His abdomen is soft and nontender.  He had
3+ pitting edema to the knees bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 6.2, hematocrit 37.9,
platelet count 191.  Differential on that white count was 73%
neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes.  Coags with PT 12.5, PTT 26.3,
INR 1.0.  Chem-7:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride 93,
bicarb 40, BUN 16, creatinine 0.8, glucose 115, calcium 9.4,
magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 3.1.  CK was 100, MB 7, troponin-T
0.02.

ABG:  7.20/112/62 on 50% face mask.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, right bundle
branch block, T-wave flattening in III and L.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, elevated left hemidiaphragm,
asymmetric pulmonary edema.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with history of COPD
and CHF, admitted with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and
hypercapnia.  History and physical were consistent with CHF
exacerbation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. CHF:  In the SICU, the patient was diuresed with good effect
with improvement of his O2 saturations and decreasing shortness
of breath.  He was rapidly weaned from by BiPAP back to face mask
and finally to nasal cannula. Additionally, his home medications
of losartan and metoprolol were continued.

2. Orthostatic hypotension:  The patient had intermittent
episodes of orthostatic hypotension likely secondary to
overdiuresis with Lasix in treating his CHF.  Also possibly
secondary to initial titration of his cardiac medicines.
Therefore while in-house, the Lasix was held and losartan was
decreased to 12.5 mg q.p.m. from his initial dose 75 b.i.d.

3. Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was found to be in atrial
fibrillation while he was in the hospital, which is a new
diagnosis for him.  Echocardiogram was performed:  Moderately
dilated left and right atria and left ventricular ejection
fraction of 30% with near akinesis of the inferior septum and
inferior walls and mild hypokinesis of everything else
including RV.  The RV was also dilated.  Examination of the
valves revealed trace AI, 1+ MR, and 2+ TR with moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension of 48+ RA.  A small
pericardial effusion was noted and the patient was in-fact in
atrial fibrillation.

Rate control of atrial fibrillation was achieved with beta
blockers, which were initially titrated up, but then used to
be decreased secondary to the patient's orthostatic
hypotension.  Nevertheless, the patient remained in excellent
rate control.  Anticoagulation was not begun secondary to the
patient's hematuria as well as concern over his advanced age
and possible fall risk.  Still need to be further addressed
as an outpatient.

4. Hematuria:  The patient developed hematuria while he was
in the ICU likely secondary to traumatic Foley insertion due
to due his enlarged prostate from his benign prostatic
hypertrophy.  The hematuria cleared while the patient was
in-house.  However, it was felt that Coumadin should not be
started until it is absolutely certain that the hematuria had
fully resolved.  Urology was consulted during the patient's
stay in the SICU, and their assistance is greatly
appreciated.

5. Possible pneumonia or bronchitis:  Patient remained
afebrile while he was in hospital, however, his sputum was
initially brown.  He therefore received a total of seven days
of levofloxacin for treatment of possible pneumonia or
bronchitis.

6. COPD:  Patient's outpatient inhalers as well as oxygen
were continued for his COPD in addition to nebulizer
treatments prn.  His COPD remained stable while he was in the
hospital, and his oxygenation status remained at baseline
once his CHF exacerbation had been treated.

7. The patient's other medical problems namely CAD,
hypothyroidism, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and depression
were stable while the patient was in-house, and his
outpatient medicines were continued.

8. Weakness:  The patient had significant deconditioning due
to his poor functional status at home for several weeks prior
to admission in addition to his prolonged hospital stay.
Physical Therapy was consulted, and felt that the patient
would benefit greatly from home PT.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.  Patient ambulates and
maintained O2 saturations over 88% on 2 liters of nasal
cannula oxygen.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with VNA services for blood
pressure monitoring as well as home physical therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
2. Atrial fibrillation.
3. Orthostatic hypotension.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. Right lung nodule.
6. Coronary artery disease.
7. Hypertension.
8. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
9. Hypothyroidism.
10. Depression.
11. Hematuria, resolved.
