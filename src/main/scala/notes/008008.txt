Chief Complaint:
BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy s/p [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery
PICC placement
Tunneled Dialysis Catheter Replacement
Central Venous Catheter Placement - L Subclavian
Abdominal Angiography
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
69 ESRD on HD [**1-26**] presents with BRBPR starting yesterday.  Had
9-10 episodes small amounts initially then up to 1 cup with
small clots yesterday evening; last episode 11:15am today.  No
lightheadedness, syncope, abd pain, chest pain.  Last admitted
to this hospital [**12-30**] for LGIB. Colonoscopy at that time showed
diverticulosis and hemorrhoids.  EGD showed no bleed.
.
On labs, had serum K greater than 10.  EKG showed PR
prolongation and widened QRS.  Got kayexalate, Ca, insulin,
dextrose and EKG changes improved.  K decreased to 8.  Attempts
to place temp HD line failed. Plans for IR guided placement
tunneled line tomorrow AM secured by renal fellow.  Over last
week she has had difficulty with HD due to a clot in her
tunneled line.  Her husband notes increased lethargy and
disturbance with sleep-wake cycle.  No dyspnea, orthopnea, PND,
or fevers.
.
Got levofloxacin for aymptomatic bactiuria in ESRD patient.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-7**]: CXR: INDICATION: Multiple line attempts.  There has been
interval removal of a left subclavian vascular catheter. A
preexisting right subclavian catheter is unchanged in position,
and there is no evidence of pneumothorax. A nasogastric tube is
then placed, terminating within the stomach. There is otherwise
no significant change since the recent radiograph of several
hours earlier.
.
[**3-8**]: TAgged RBC scan: No abnormal areas of tracer uptake.
.
[**3-11**]: Head CT: There is no evidence of acute intra- or
extra-axial hemorrhage. There are multiple areas of
periventricular white matter hypodensity that may represent
chronic small vessel ischemic disease. No hydrocephalus or shift
of normally midline structures. Basal cisterns appear patent.
There are air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinus. There is
slight mucosal thickening of left maxillary sinus
.
[**2175-3-13**]: Tagged RBC scan: Got tracer, but refused imaging.
.
[**2175-3-14**]: Tagged RBC Scan: Abnormal focus of tracer activity is
present in the right upper quadrant that is felt to most likely
to localize to the hepatic flexure of the large bowel. However
relatively little distal movement of tracer limits the
confidence of this localization and a possibility that is felt
to be less likely to bleeding in the duodenum.
ADDENDUM: Additional delayed images were obtained 7 hours after
tracer
injection. Tracer is seen within the hepatic flexure and
extending antegrade into the transverse colon, and descending
colon with an appearance consistent with active bleeding at this
site.
.
EEG: [**2175-3-13**]:
BACKGROUND: In the very brief portions of the record with the
patient
awake, rare rhythms as fast as [**9-3**] Hz were seen of low to
moderate
voltage while [**7-1**] Hz rhythms predominated biposteriorly. The
anterior-posterior voltage gradient was preserved. No focal,
lateralized, or discharging abnormalities were seen.
HYPERVENTILATION: Not performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: No activation of the record.
SLEEP: The patient appeared to be in stages I, II, and
occasionally III
throughout the overwhelming majority of this record. Vertex
activity
was seen symmetrically in stage II.
CARDIAC MONITOR: No arrhythmias noted.
IMPRESSION: Possibly abnormal due to the excessively drowsy
record
obtained which, in the absence of medication or sleep
deprivation, might
indicate an early encephalopathy. No definitive discharging
abnormalities were seen, however.
.
[**2175-3-15**]: Angiography - Abdominal:
IMPRESSION: Nonselective aortogram, selective gastroduodenal
arteriography, selective arteriography via the third order
branches of the SMA and second order branch into the ileocolic
artery demonstrated no active bleeding. No intervention was
performed.
.
[**3-21**] Colonoscopy: Red blood was seen in most of the colon all
the way to the hepatic flexure.  No blood was seen in the cecum.
 An adherent clot was seen at the hepatic flexure.  The clot was
washed off with active oozing seen from likely an angioectasia
or Dieulafoy's.  2 1 cc Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**] injections were
applied for hemostasis with success.  [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was
applied for hemostasis successfully.  Petechial-like lesions
were noted in the cecum and hepatic flexure.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 yo female with DM2 and ESRD on HD admitted with GIB
and hyperkalemia.  The patient's hyperkalemia was attributed to
missed hemodialysis.  She received Kayexalate, calcium, bicarb,
and insulin in the ED.  EKG showed QRS complex narrowing
post-treatment.  She was urgently dialyzed, but was sent to
angiography and was diagnosed with a HD catheter clot.  TPA was
instilled without effect and the patient underwent dialysis
catheter change.  During her hospitalization she received
dialysis per renal team.
.
The patient had a history of multiple pior admission for GI
Bleed.  She began to have guaiac positive dark stool in the ICU.
 She underwent tagged RBC scan from [**3-14**], which showed possible
R hepatic flexure diverticuli.  Angiogram on [**3-15**] was negative.
The patient was hesistant to undergo any further procedures for
several days.  General surgery was consulted and felt that the
pt was a poor surgical candidate.  Finally on [**3-20**] she consented
to and underwent colonoscopy.  She had cauterization and capping
of bleeding vessel.  Her hematocrit was monitored Q8 hours.  She
received daily blood transfusions to keep her Hct >30 (due to
NSTEMI as below).  She remained hemodynamically stable.  She
also received [**Hospital1 **] PPI therapy.  She was kept NPO and received
nutrition by TPN.  On discharge her Hct had remained stable and
she was tolerating a low-residue diet.
.
In the ICU she ruled in for an NSTEMI by elevated CK/MB and
tropT, likely [**1-26**] stress from GI bleed.  No anticoagulation was
given due to GI Bleed. Serial EKG showed no changes.  She was
continued on low dose [**Month/Day (2) **], lipitor, and metoprolol 25mg PO TID.
She will need to arrange outpatient cardiology follow-up.
.
She was diagnosed with an ESBL Klebsiella UTI ([**3-7**]) and
underwent 7 days treatment with meropenem.  Her ICU course was
also complicated by ICU delirium wi
