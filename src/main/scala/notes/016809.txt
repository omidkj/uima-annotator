History of Present Illness:
63yoM with h/o type 2 DM, HTN, HL, PE/DVT on coumadin, OSA,
obesity who presented to the ER today c/o feeling unwell since
Thursday. He reports being in his USOH until he went on a

with a dozen of his friends. [**Name (NI) **] reports that the weather was
extremely hot and that he thinks he got dehydrated while there -
was only drinking a few small bottles of water each day and
wasn't eating because he wasn't feeling well. He continued to
take his home meds despite feeling unwell (lisinopril, HCTZ,
metformin, etc.) though did miss this AM's doses. He denies

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospitalization Summary:
63yoM with h/o type 2 DM, HTN, HL, PE/DVT on coumadin, OSA,
obesity who presented to the ER today c/o feeling unwell since
Thursday w/ muscle weakness/cramps; found to have hyperkalemia
and renal failure w/ profound anion gap metabolic acidosis on
arrival whose metabolic acidosis and renal failure resolved
following short-term dialysis and electrolyte repletion as
needed for a post-ATN diuresis.
.
# Acute kidney injury from Volume Depletion Progressing to ATN:
Cr on presentation was 12.7 w/ BUN 106 (up from nl Cr of 0.79 13
days prior). FeNa was 3.44% and the patient appeared
hypovolemic. An initial prerenal insult in conjunction with ATN
from continuing to take his meds (lisinopril, HCTZ) was thought
to be the cause of the renal failure. Renal ultrasound showed no
hydronephrosis. Lisinopril, HCTZ, metformin, lipitor, and
mirapex were held. The patient was urgently dialyzed on arrival
to the ICU for hyperkalemia, acidemia, and uremia. He was on
continous dialysis for approximately 14 hours but was able to be
taken off during HD2 given that his lactate decreased to 2, his
metabolic acidosis resolved, and his hyperkalemia resolved. By
HD3, Cr was decreased to 3.7. He developed a brisk post-ATN
diuresis for which he was given NS boluses for volume support
(
