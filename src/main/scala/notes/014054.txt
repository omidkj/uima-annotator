Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
Distended Abdomen

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation for airway protection
[**2148-1-26**] - paracentesis
[**2148-1-31**] - paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
63 yo male with a history of dCHF with multiple admissions for
CHF exarcebation and NASH Cirrhosis who was recently admitted
for abdominal distension and ascites, now presents with
worsening abdominal distention and abdominal pain.  The pt was
recently admitted in [**Month (only) 1096**] for a similar presentation and
underwent [**2148-1-10**] therapeutic tap with 2L removed. At that
time, protein 0.9 was suggestive of cirrhotic etiology of
ascites more than heart failure. No medications were changed,
however the pt was instructed to initiate a low sodium diet, and
follow up with liver as an outpatient.  Since that admission the
pt states he has been taking his medications, however has had
difficulty adhering to low sodium and fluid restricted diets. He
has noted increasing abdominal pain and distention. He has been
taking oxycodone for this pain. He denies fevers, chills, n/v/d.
He denies night sweats.
.
In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable. He refused
paracentesis, requesting an IR guided instead. Bcx was sent. CXR
was nl. The pt was empirically treated with Ceftriaxone 1g IV
and Morphine 5mg IVx1. He was also noted to have a glucose 56
and was given an amp of dextrose.  On the floor FSG was
initially 114. The pt complained of abdominal pain and
distension.  He was noted to be somnolent in the nightfloat
admission note.
.
MICU team at the scene for a code blue called.  Nursing found
patient unresponsive.  He has secretions draining from his
mouth.  FS was 29.  A PIV in his left thumb dislodged prior to
team arrival.  His right PIV malfunctioned.  A left hand PIV was
placed and he was given D5, but there was a delay given poor
access.  An right tib IO was also placed for access.  He was
intubated for airway protection after succynlcholine.  ABG was
obtained and revealed 7.44/52/201 with K 2.7 and lactate 1.8.

IMAGING
[**2148-1-23**] CHEST (PA & LAT): No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2148-1-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): The cardiac silhouette size is
unchanged, and appears mildly enlarged. Mediastinal and hilar
contours are stable, and there is no evidence of pulmonary
edema. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax
is present. There are mild degenerative changes of the thoracic
spine. IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2148-1-24**] EEG: This is an abnormal EEG because of moderate diffuse
background slowing as well as nearly continuous bifrontal
slowing and
occasional triphasic waves. These findings are indicative of
moderate
diffuse encephalopathy which is etiologically non-specific. The
finding
of diffuse triphasic waves suggest a metabolic component (as is
seen in
hepatic or renal failure) contributing to the patient's
encephalopathy.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo male history of dHF and NASH Cirrhosis admitted for
persistent abdominal distention and pain, hospital course
complicated by intubation for unresponsive state secondary to
hypoglycemia, now s/p paracentesis x2.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Hypoglycemia/T2DM: On morning of [**1-24**], pt was found
unresponsive and code blue was called. His blood sugar was found
to be 29. He takes insulin at home. Most likely a result of poor
PO intake with continued insulin therapy. Per report of family,
he has been found unresponsive before, and he may be having
repeated hypoglycemic episodes. He was transferred to the MICU
on a D10 drip, and his blood sugar rose promptly. He was
extubated and weaned off of the insulin gtt, and transferred out
of the MICU after 2 days to the general medical floor, where his
unresponsiveness was resolved as of MICU callout. No evidence of
hepatic encephalopathy. No falls on floor or history of head
trauma since admission. EKG without acute abnormality during
code situation. [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes team was consulted, and his ISS
was adjusted and lantus changed to 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and his ISS was
adjusted as well.

# Increasing ascites/Abdominal Pain: He presented complaining of
weight gain, abdominal distention, and diffuse
