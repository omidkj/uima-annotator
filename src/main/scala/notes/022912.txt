Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**]
Chief Complaint:
right hip pain, fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 88 year-old man with dementia, COPD, CHF,
osteoarthritis s/p L hip replacement and h/o TIA who presented
to the ED after a fall. In the ED, he was initially stable, but
he began to become increasingly agitated and aggressive. He
received haloperidol and ativan, but remained combative. His O2
sats never dipped below 90% but he became even more agitated,
diaphoretic and, after discussion with the pt's daughter, the
decision was made to intubate him so a w/u of his fall could be
undertaken.

There was some concern about O2 sats in the low 90s, and after a
d-dimer returned at 1000, a CTPA was done. It was negative. A
head CT revealed no acute change. Hip films revealed.

He was admitted to the ICU intubated.

(EF unknown) who presented from his nursing home after falling
and having some right-sided weakness. In the ED, he became
