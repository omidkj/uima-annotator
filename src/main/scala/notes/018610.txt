Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease requiring
revascularization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old man in
generally good health with a new onset of dyspnea on exertion
and angina who underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**8-29**]
which revealed two vessel coronary artery disease with an
ejection fraction of 40%.  There was disease in the proximal
LAD with a stenosis at D1 of 70% and 95% osteal D1 lesion,
95% distal RCA lesion with occluded PDA, mild PVB disease and
collaterals left to right.  Given these findings, he was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] for coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  Included Gemfibrozil, Atenolol, Aspirin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2146-8-29**] where he underwent a CABG
times three as follows: LIMA to LAD, left radial to D1
saphenous vein graft to PDA performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**], assisted
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11743**].  Postoperative ejection fraction was 50-55%.
The patient was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery
recovery unit on Nitroglycerin and Neo-Synephrine.  The
patient had a temperature immediately postoperatively and
sputum cultures were sent that grew out gram negative rods
for which she was subsequently treated with Levofloxacin.
The patient otherwise did well and was transferred to the
floor by postoperative day #3.  He did have another fever
spike on postoperative day #3 at which point the Levofloxacin
was begun for the gram negative rods in the sputum.  He also
had one episode where he complained of epigastric pain and
EKG was obtained which demonstrated a right bundle branch
block.  Enzymes were recycled and were downward trending.  He
did undergo a blood transfusion on postoperative day #4 for a
hematocrit of 20 and tachycardia with mild hypotension.  The
patient otherwise did very well.  By postoperative day #5 was
without complaints.  On physical exam, heart rate was 85,
blood pressure 116/70, clear to auscultation on the right
with bronchial breath sounds at the left base and egophony.
His sternum was stable with a regular rate and rhythm.  His
abdomen was soft.  His extremities were with minimal edema.
Given these findings and the fact that he was ambulating
extremely well, it was felt that he was stable for discharge.
He was discharged on Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, potassium
chloride 20 mEq po q d for 7 days, Lasix 20 mg po bid for 7
days, Colace 100 mg po bid, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Aspirin 81
mg po q d, Motrin prn, Imdur 30 mg po q d, Niferex 150 mg po
q d and Levofloxacin 500 mg po q d for 7 days for treatment
of a potential hospital acquired pneumonia as well as
Percocet.  The patient was instructed to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in [**1-9**] weeks as well as his primary care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-9**]
weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG times three
performed on [**2146-8-29**].
