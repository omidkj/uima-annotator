Chief Complaint:
somnolence, hypoglycemia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with a history of RCC s/p partial nephrectomy with known
metastasis to liver/pancreas, CKD recently started on HD,
systolic CHF (EF 20%), and insulin dependent DM, presenting with
hypoglycemia, persisent somnolence and respiratory distress.
Patient was found this evening by his family members to be
altered and somnolent in bed.  They called EMS and on arrival
was noted to have a fingerstick of 21. Patient was given D50 and
thiamine.

Per report of patient's family, patient has had no fever, cough.
 Wife only notes that he has been more somnolent in the last 24
hours.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 **] ED, inital vitals were T 87.5, HR 58 BP 98/53
RR 22 sating 100% on 15L and fingerstick was >100. Patient was
noted to be in respiratory distress with confusion.  Repeat
fingerstick was in the 20s, and patient was given an amp of D50.

Goals of care discussion took place with family and primary
oncologist and wife decided to keep patient full code.
On exam, patient was noted to have 3+ edema up to his
sacrum/abdomen.  Abdomen was nontender.
Labs were notable for WBC 6.3, AST 131, ALT 42 and AP 314 with
normal Tbili 0.2 and lipase 20.  Hematocrit at patient's
baseline (36.9), lactate 1.7, and K 5.2.
Patient was hypotensive to 80-90s and a left IJ central line was
placed and started on levophed. Patient was noted to have agonal
breathing and was placed on a non-rebreather.  Saturations in
90s on NRB with continued agonal breathing, respiratory rate of
[**8-15**] with periods of apnea, and patient was intubated.  CXR
showed evidence of severe volume overload with question of right
sided pneumonia.  Started vancomycin and levofloxacin to cover
for HCAP, and transferred to ICU for further management.
Vital signs prior to transfer were HR 77, BP 80/45 on levophed
0.05, with vent set at FiO2 60%, Vt 500, PEEP 10.  ABG prior to
transfer was 7.15/78/134/29.

Of note, on the day prior to admission, patient was seen by
primary cardiologist who noted him to be hypotensive with volume
overload, elevated jugular venous pressure and severe lower
extremity edema.  He also saw his primary oncologist on the same
day who discussed goals of care with the patient and his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] expressed that he was not ready to consider home
hospice, and repeated his wish to be full code.

On arrival to the ICU, vital signs were T 96.8, HR 94, BP 80/56
maxed on levophed.  FS 77 following 1amp D50 prior to transfer.
Patient given 1amp D50 on arrival, with FS 177 15 minutes later.
 Patient intubated and sedated.

Review of systems:  unable to obtain as patient intubated.

Imaging:
1. Marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, cardiomegaly
versus pericardial effusion. There is interval increase in size
of right pleural effusion, as well as in perihilar and bibasilar
air space opacity compatible with moderate pulmonary edema.
2. Interval placement of a right IJ hemodialysis catheter, the
tip of which is in the region of the right atrium.


Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo M with h/o of RCC with mets to liver/pancreas, sCHF (EF
20%), IDDM, CKD on HD, presenting with respiratory failure and
hypotension, s/p intubation on pressors.

# Respiratory failure:  Patient presented with evidence of
marked volume overload with elevated JVP, anasarca, and
elevation of LFTs concerning for RV overload and CXR indicating
pulmonary edema and enlarged cardiac silhouette.  Given known EF
of 20%, likely cause of respiratory failure was pulmonary edema.
 Patient did not respond to IV lasix.  Urgent CRRT was
considered however family decided to make patietn CMO.  He was
terminally extubated and expired at 4:41pm.

# Hypotension:  Appeared to be in cardiogenic shock as
extremities cool and cyanotic.  Patient required levophed and
vasopressin, and pressures did tolerate lowering either.  Family
decided to make patient CMO, and pressors were discontinued.

# Goals of care: Patient and his wife had extensive goals of
care discussion with primary oncologist the day prior to
admission.  Patient expressed wishes to be full code and was not
ready to explore the idea of hospice yet.  Primary oncologist
spoke with wife from ER, and expressed that "heroic measures may
not be lifesaving" and explained that withdrawal of care may be
necessary.  Following further discussion on patient arrival to
ICU, wife decided to make patient DNR, then CMO.  Patient
expired at 4:41pm on [**2181-12-21**].
