LABORATORY DATA, X-RAYS AND PERTINENT REPORTS:  White count
on admission 7.9, at discharge was 11. This could probably be
the effect of steroids. BNP was not significant. CK mildly
elevated. Cardiac enzymes normal. Sputum culture showed some
PMNs with epithelial cells, gram positive cocci, most likely
oropharyngeal flora. Chest x-ray done on admission revealed
emphysema, however, no evidence of infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  COPD exacerbation. The patient was
initially admitted to the intensive care unit because of the
oxygen need, however, did not require intubation or BiPAP. He
was treated with nebulization, erythromycin for COPD
exacerbation as well as IV steroids with marked improvement
in his shortness of breath. He was thereafter transferred to
the floor after a day of watching in the ICU. On the floor,
he was transitioned to oral steroids and is scheduled to
complete a taper over the next few days. Nebulizations were
changed to MDIs. Azithromycin will be completed for a total
of 5 days. The patient required 2 liters of oxygen at all
times. He states at home he uses oxygen only nocturnally,
however, he was advised that he should use oxygen in the day
as well, especially during ambulation. Smoking cessation was
discussed by the hospitalist as well as social worker and
information regarding smoking cessation was provided to the
patient. Nicotine patches were offered as well. He said he
had a prescription for Nicotine patches at home. Some
education about self treatment with prednisone during the
next flare was also advised. He is up to date with the flu
shot as well as Pneumovax.

continued.

some amount of Ativan. However, prior to discharge, his CIWA
scale was zero. Social worker was consulted who also
counseled him regarding alcohol abstinence. The patient is
