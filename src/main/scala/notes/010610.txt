Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy with biopsy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 437**] is an 86 year-old Mandarin (dialect) speaking man with
a remote history of unknown abdominal surgery and no other known
past medical history who presents with RUQ abdominal pain.  Per
son, the pain began this AM after breakfast with intermittent,
sharp, severe and lasting 5-6 minutes.  He had another episode
early afternoon while son present.  His son noted that the
severe pain was accompanied by shallow breathing and
lightheadedness, along with chills and rigors, so called EMS.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 99.3, P 93, BP 146/62, RR 22,
O2sat 99 RA.  On exam, abd with RUQ tenderness but benign; stool
guaiac negative.  Temp spiked to 102.6 in ED with accompanying
rigors; pt given tylenol followed by ibuprofen with
defervescence. Labs notable for a Hct 19.9 (33.4 in [**2117**]), MCV
84 with iron 14 and ferritin 14; platelets, hapto, and
fibrinogen nl.  Lactate initially 5.6.  He was given 2 units
pRBC and 1.5L NS IVF with normalization of his ST depessions and
improvement in lactate to 1.5.  1st set cardiac enzymes
negative.  U/A with 3-5 RBC and WBC, mod bact, 0-2 epis.  FAST
scan was negative for bleed.  CT torso showed probably left
renal collecting system transitional cell ca causing partial
obstruction with complex fluid around the left kidney likely
representing fornix rupture. There was also focal transverse
colon wall thickening concerning for neoplasm with hypodense
liver lesions and cystic duct enhancing lesion concerning for
mets.  Liver u/s showed normal GB and liver masses.  Bcx x 2 and
Ucx sent. Patient was started on cipro 400mg IV and flagyl 500mg
IV initially, then broadened to ceftriaxone 1gm IV.  He also
received pantoprazole 40mg IV. On transfer, VS: T 99.3, BP
106/56, P 59, RR 18, O2sat 100%RA.
.
On the floor, pt reports that abdominal pain is much improved
and minimal currently.  He denies any early satiety or decreased
appetite. Prior to today, no fevers, chills, night sweats. He
has had occasional BRB on toilet paper and does describe
dark-colored stools but denies frank hematochezia otherwise.
Per son, weight loss of only [**4-7**] lbs in past 10 years.  No
known colonoscopy in past.

CT torso:
1. Urothelial thickening and enhancement within the left renal
collecting
system, concerning for transitional cell carcinoma, which
results in mild left
hydronephrosis. 9-mm left para-aortic lymph node is suspicious
for metastatic
involvement.

2. Complex left perinephric fluid collection demonstrates
progressive
enhancement, and may be secondary to forniceal rupture.

3. Multiple hepatic metastases.

4. Area of focal wall thickening and narrowing in the transverse
colon may be
due to peristalsis, but underlying neoplasm is not excluded.
Correlation with
colonoscopy is recommended.

5. Focal enhancement of the cystic duct, possibly due to
metastasis, but may
be inflammatory as well.

6. Severe emphysema with 3-mm right upper lobe nodule.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo man with no significant PMH other than unclear and remote
abdominal surgery p/w RUQ abdominal pain, found to have anemia
to Hct 19 and CT torso findings suggestive of metastatic disease


.
# Metastatic colon cancer: The patient had imaging findings
consistent with a primary colon or transitional renal cell
carcinoma with evidence of metastasis to the liver. He had a
significantly elevated CEA level.  The gastrointestinology
service was consulted.  Colonoscopy with biopsy revealed likely
adenocarcinoma.  A family meeting was held to inform the patient
and his family of the diagnosis and treatment options.  Oncology
and surgery consulting services provided more information about
what they could offer. Palliative care assisted with decision
making.  Arrangements were made to follow up in oncology clinic
for likely initiation of capecitabine.  _________
.
# Anemia:. He was transfused a total of 4 units of pRBC with an
appropriate increase in hematocrit. He remained hemodynamically
stable, and Hct did not fall again.
.
#Abdominal pain: Resolved soon after admission.
.
# Dynamic ST-depressions: The patient has no known history of
CAD. ST changes occurred in the setting of tachycardia secondary
to fever or abdominal pain with normalization following improved
rate control. Cardiac enzymes were trended and were normal.  TTE
done later in the admission for surgical risk planning showed an
essentially normal heart.
.
# RUL nodule: 3mm nodule could represent metastatic disease but
nonspecific.
.
# COPD: Significant smoking history with CT chest findings
consistent with emphysema.  O2 Sats ranged 88-92% on RA.  He was
given nebulizers as needed.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital because of abdominal pain.  You were
found to have low blood counts.  You received blood

liver.  Colonoscopy showed that this is due to metastatic colon
cancer.  You spoke with the oncologists and arranged to follow
up with them in clinic to begin chemotherapy.

No medications were added this hospitalization.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up in oncology clinic and with your primary care
doctor:
