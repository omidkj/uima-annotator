department with complaints of severe non-radiating, crampy
abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting for 24 hours.
She complained of constipation, and reported no bowel movement

[**Name (NI) 2152**], who is health care proxy.

Family History:
n/c

Physical Exam:
T: 99.0  HR 76  BP 160/70  RR 18, Spo2 94% on RA

HEENT: aniceteric, no acute distress, PERRLA, membranes dry, no
JVD.
Cardivascular: Regular S1S2.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
Abdomen: obese, distended, diffusely tender, hernia in upper
midline
Rectal: guaic negative, normal tone


Pertinent Results:
CT abd/pelvis [**2108-5-8**]
IMPRESSION: Dilated proximal loops of small bowel and collapsed
distal ileum and colon are consistent with small-bowel
obstruction. Focal transition points are located within two
adjacent but separate right anterior abdominal wall hernias.
Findings suggest that there is some passage of fluid containing
oral contrast beyond the transition points. There are no
findings to suggest strangulation/incarceration.
.
ADDENDUM: Delayed images 3 hours after the initial study were
obtained to assess passage of contrast. There is some
progression of contrast in proximal small bowel loops, though
there is no significant progression of contrast into distal
loops, which remain collapsed, suggesting a high-grade
obstruction. These findings were discussed with the surgery
resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 5:30 am on [**2108-5-8**].
.
Cardiac cath
PTCA COMMENTS:     The angiogram showed a mid circumflex lesion
of
90 percent. We planned to treat this lesion with POBA and stent
only if
needed. We used Bivalirudin, Aspirin and Clopidogrel
prophylactically. A
6F XB 3.5 guide provided adequate support. A Prowater wire
crossed in to
the distal vessel easily. We then performed PTCA of the lesion
with a
2.5 X 15mm Voyager balloon at10 atm X 3. The final angiogram
showed TIMI
III flow with no residual stenosis, small non flow limiting
dissection,
no perforation and no embolisation. The patient left the lab in
a stable
condition.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. The totally occluded
diagonal
branch is not suitable for angioplasty.
2. New-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
and
hypotension.
3. Patient intubated.
4. Successful POBA of the mid LCX lesion
.
Echo
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic
function is  hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity
is small. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is  seen.
. Right upper extremity ultrasound
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis of the left
upper extremity

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the ED and found to have a high grade
small bowel obstruction. She was taken to the OR directly. She
tolerated the procedure well, she was extubated and transferred
to ICU.
.
Cardiovascular: POD#1 developed low blood pressure and was
started on low dose Neo. POD#2, had positive troponins, ruled in
for MI. She was sent for emergent cardiac cath. She recieved
angioplasty of the left circumflex artery. Developed afib, and
was cardioverted. She was initiated on amiodarone drip.
Converted to sinus rhythm. Femoral sheaths pulled POD#5. Had
persistent hypertension throughout ICU course, managed by her
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] with nitro and metoprolol. Diuresed throughout
admission with lasix.
.
Pulmonary: Was reintubated POD#2 secondary to NSTEMI. POD#3
developed right upper lobe nosocomial pneumonia. Initiated on
Vanco/Zosyn. Extubated POD#5. Respiratory status improved with
antibiotics, weaned to room air at time of discharge.
.
Abdomen: remained soft, nontender with midline incision intact.
2 JP drains in place. JP#1 removed POD#11. JP#2 removed POD#12.
Staples removed POD#14. Incision remains dry and intact.
.
GI: Pt remained with NGT in place due to an ileus. NGT removed
and ileus resolved POD#7. Developed frequent diarrhea POD#8,
CDiff positive. Initiated Vanco liquid, due to intolerance to
Flagyl. On Vanco taper per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10113**], gastroenterology.
.
GU: Recieved aggressive fluid resuscitation for low urine
output. Foley catheter until POD#10. Incontinent of urine.
.
Nutrition: On TPN until POD#8. Tolerated regular diet on POD#9.
Monitored with calorie counts to ensure adequate oral intake.
TPN tapered off on POD#11.
.
Extremities: Edema of upper and lower extremities at times
during admission, due to aggressive fluid resuscitation and
history of CHF. Left upper extremity was swollen POD#9.
Ultrasound revealed no thrombus.
.
Musculoskeletal: PT worked with her consistently for
strengthening and conditioning.
.
Pt was transferred to med-[**Doctor First Name **] floor on POD#8. She continued to
follow an uneventful post-op course.
