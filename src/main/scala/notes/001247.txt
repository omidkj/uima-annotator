Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: ?# aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: [**Pager number **] (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to [**Pager number 1192**] [[**12-2**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. [**Month/Day (2) **] (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Post CPB: A prosthetic valve is seen in the aortic position. No
AI, no leak. MR [**First Name (Titles) 19947**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**]. Good biventricular systolic
fxn. Aorta intact. Other parameters as pre-bypass.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
INDICATION: Status post aortic valve replacement.

COMPARISON: [**2156-11-12**].

UPRIGHT AP CHEST: Sternotomy wires are unchanged, as is
cardiomegaly and the heavily calcified aorta. [**Month/Day/Year **] bilateral
pleural effusions are increased in volume from [**11-12**].
The upper lungs are well aerated, but there is bibasilar
atelectasis related to the effusions. The right IJ sheath has
been removed. No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: [**Month (only) **] bilateral pleural effusions are increased
in volume compared to [**11-12**].


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**11-10**] where she underwent
an AVR. She was transferred to the ICU in critical but stable
condition on neosynephrine and propofol. She was seen by GU
immediately postop for hematuria in the setting of known bladder
tumor. CBI was started. She remained intubated overnight and was
extubated on POD #1. Her hematuria resolved. Her neo was weaned
to off on POD #4. She was transfused. She was transferred to the
floor on POD #5. She was seen by EP for afib with bradycardia,
and they recommended telemetry monitoring at rehab. She was
ready for discharge to rehab on POD #6.
