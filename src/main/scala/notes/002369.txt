Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
70-year old gentleman with a history of diabetes, chronic kidney
disease (baseline Cr 1.4) and diastolic CHF (EF LVEF>55)
originally presenting from rehab facility on [**11-7**] for one day
of hypotension 3 days after slipping and falling. Per report had
been getting twice his usual dose of valsartan for unclear
reasons. No chest pain, not SOB, but sweaty and mildly
nauseated.

Review of systems on admission was notable for malaise since his
admission for chest pain at the start of [**Month (only) 359**]. He feels
generally weak and apathetic, which is unusual for him. He has
also had a non-productive cough for several weeks, for which he
was started on azithromycin five days ago. He has recently been
constipated. He denies recent fevers, chills, difficulty
urinating or headaches.

In the emergency department his VS were T 98, BP 94/48 improving
to 134/99, HR 60, RR 18 and 100% on RA. He was found to have a
new leukocytosis and crackles on lung exam and was given vanc,
zosyn and flagyl for a hospital-acquired pneumonia. A right IJ
was placed and he was given 3.5L of normal saline with
improvement of BPs. He had elevated LFTs and an abdominal and
pelvic CT scan was done, revealing a moderate pericardial
effusion. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis.

hospitalization on [**2131-10-10**] he lived alone and did his own
shopping/cooking and was independent with ADLs/IADLs. He was
admitted now after having 2-3 weeks of rehab and he had been
home for only 1 day. He has no children and has never been

Imaging:
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US [**2132-11-7**]:
1. Gallbladder sludge without secondary findings to suggest
acute
cholecystitis.
2. Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver diseases
including significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be
excluded in this examination. Hypoechoic focus adjacent to the
gallbladder fossa most likely represents focal sparing.

CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2132-11-7**]:
1. Moderate sized pericardial effusion, which is larger compared
to [**2132-10-22**].
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, with opacification of the
right lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect atelectasis or consolidation.
3. Diverticulosis, without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. Single locule of air within the anterior subcutaneous fat in
the lower
abdomen. This may relate to subcutaneous injection. Clinical
correlation
suggested.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2132-11-9**]:
Comparison is made with prior study [**11-8**]. Enlarged
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable. Patient has known pericardial effusion and
mild
cardiomegaly. Minimal bibasilar atelectases larger on the right
side are
unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or enlarging pleural
effusions. Right IJ catheter remains in place.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hypotension likely related to the recent increase in his
valsartan. There was some concern that he might have an
increasing pericardial effusion based on his chest CT. An
echocardiogram showed no evidence of tamponade. Observed in MICU
for 24 hours and pressures rising and stable. Transferred to
floor for further monitoring.

1. Hypotension: Resolved with IVF. Given response to fluids most
likely due to doubling of dose of [**Last Name (un) **] and possibly some volume
depletion and not sepsis. Only SIRS criteria was leukocytosis.
Initial concern for tamponade but no evidence of evolving
effusion on echo.  Valsartan dose decreased to 40mg Daily from
80mg [**Hospital1 **].  Lasix dose decreased from 80mg Daily from [**Hospital1 **].

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's Cr is now
resolving to 1.7 from a peak of 2.6 vs a baseline of ~ 1.4. Most
likely cause is pre-renal exacerbated by high levels of [**Last Name (un) **] and
hypotension.

3. Leukocytosis: Improving. 17.2 on admission --> 13.9 day
discharge. UA negative. No clinical symptoms of pneumonia and
CXR suggests atelactasis. Afebrile throughout admission.
Cultures negative on discharge.

4. Pericardial Effusion: New pericardial effusion on CT scan not
present three weeks ago but without significant effusion on
echo. No clinical symptoms of tamponade.

5. Atrial fibrillation: Currently in NSR. Patient had newly
diagnosed Afib on his last admission ~ 4 weeks prior to the
current admission. Continue diltiazem and digoxin.

6. INR elevated 3.8 on day of discharge, recommended to hold
coumadin on day of discharged and start decreased coumadin dose
2 mg on [**2132-11-13**].

7. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Patient has difficult to control
diabetes and is followed at the [**Last Name (un) **]. His most recent A1c was
8.3%. Was on Insulin 100 units TID

8. Diastolic CHF: No sign of acute CHF episode. Continued
outpatient medications.
Decreased Lasix to 80mg Daily from [**Hospital1 **]. Can increase if patient
becomes fluid overloaded. Recommend daily weights and strict
I/O, if becomes positive increase Lasix.  Patient will follow up
with cardiology Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**1-11**] weeks.

9. Elevated transaminases: Stable from prior admission when
changes consistent with fatty liver were seen on ultrasound.

10. Depression: Patient reports poor mood and satisfaction. TSH
was normal. He was continued on his Effexor and Celexa.

11. Hyperlidemia: Continued rosuvastatin and niacin.

12. GOUT: Continued Allopurinol

13. COPD: continue Advair, albuterol and ipratropium.

14. History of CVA: Continue plavix.

15. OSA: Pt refuses to use CPAP
