Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
syncopal episode, worsening shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PERCUTANEOUS AORTIC VALVE PLACEMENT

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 88953**] is an 81-year-old gentleman status post CABG in [**2108**]
with three grafts who has progressive lifestyle-limiting angina
and class III/IV congestive heart failure.  He has severe aortic
stenosis, a preserved ejection fraction and was turned down for
a
redo sternotomy in [**Location (un) 35240**].  He has significant COPD with an
FEV1 of 0.96 on testing done in [**2119-1-31**].  He has atrial
fibrillation and is not on Coumadin because he has severe
bruising, even on aspirin alone.  He has had significant
bleeding
complications after both knee surgery and his initial cardiac
surgery and thus was felt to be a very poor candidate for redo
sternotomy.
     Mr [**Known lastname 88953**] reports increasing fatigue and shortness of
breath. He reports a constant chest discomfort with activity. He
frequently has to rest. He is frustrated he can no longer mow
his
lawn.
     He denies any admissions, new events or problems,
medications changes since last visit. He continues to report
chest pressure with ambulation of about 100 feet. Resolves with
rest.

PRE-PROCEDURE STUDIES
Imaging:
Cardiac Catheterization: ([**2119-6-29**] iin VT)
CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
Left Main Artery: The left main coronary artery was normal in
size and had mild luminal irregularities.
Left Anterior Descending Artery: The proximal LAD artery has a
100% stenosis. The proximal portion of the 1st Diagonal artery
has a 90% stenosis.
Circumflex Artery: the mid Circumflex artey has a 50% stenosis
(no graft to circumflex system).
Right Coronary Artery: The proximal RCA has a 40% stenosis. The
distal RCA has a 90% stenosis. The proximal 1st RPL has a 90%
stenosis.
Grafts: All anastomoses and grafts are widely patent. The
mammary
graft to the mid LAD was without any significant lesions. The
vein graft to the 1st Diagonal was without any significant
lesions. The vein graft to the 1st RPL was without any
significant lesions.
PERIPHERAL ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
Aorta: The ingrarenal aorta is normal in size and has no
significant angiographic lesions.
Iliac: The right and left common and external iliac arteries are
normal in size and have no significant angiographic lesions.
Femoral/SFA/Profunda: The right and left common femoral arteries
are normal in size and have no significant angiogahic lesions.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2119-7-21**] at 3:00:00 PM
.
Findings
Patient experienced extreme transient lower back pain following
Definity administration. Discomfort cleared within 10 minutes.
Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor
native endocardial border definition.
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%).
No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe calcific aortic stenosis. Symmetric LVH with
normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.
