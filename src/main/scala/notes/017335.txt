[**2161-11-21**]:  x-ray of abdomen:

IMPRESSION: Contrast injected through J-tube courses into loop
of small bowel most consistent with jejunum, with no evidence of
extraluminal contrast

[**2161-11-22**]:  Chest x-ray:

 IMPRESSION:
1. NG tube with side port within the stomach.
2. Improved right pulmonary aeration. Persistent left lower lobe
atelectasis with moderate pleural effusion

[**2161-11-22**]: cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:
1. Left moderate pleural effusion is increased since prior.
Adjacent
opacification may be compressive atelectasis or consolidation in
the correct clinical setting.
2. Intermediate density fluid surrounding spleen and along the
anterior
aspect of the left lobe of the liver appears more loculated
compared to prior. Fluid along the liver causes some indentation
of the left lobe of the liver.
Fluid within the pelvis also appears more loculated compared to
prior with
mild wall enchancement noted, infection can't completely be
excluded.
3. Small fluid collection within the subcutaneous tissue
anteriorly in the
midline (2, 69) is new and likely represents post operative
changes; correlate clinically.
4. Sutures noted within a loop of the jejunum appears focally
dilated but is unchanged from prior.
5. Foley catheter with balloon noted within the urethra,
requires
repositioning


Brief Hospital Course:
  30 year old gentleman who was admitted to the Acute Care
Service on [**2161-11-21**]  with fever and abdominal pain. Upon
admission to the Intensive Care Unit,  he was made NPO, given
intravenous fluids and had an x-ray of his abdomen done to
verify placement of his J tube.  Once place verified, he had a
cat scan of his abdomen and pelvis done which showed loculated
fluid collections around the spleen, liver, and in the abdomen
for which he is on a 10 day course of augmentin.  He had blood,
urine, and sputum cultures sent. He completed a 10 day course of
meropenum on [**11-24**] which he was started for Acinetobacter in his
sputum which was idenfified on a prior admission. He has since
resumed his tube feedings via the J tube. He continues to have
the left pleural effusion as reported on his cat scan of the
chest.
  He is preparing for discharge back to his rehabilitation
facility.  He is tolerating his tube feedings via the J tube.
His foley has been discontinued and he has a condom catheter in
place.  He has been afebrile with stable vital signs.  His
abominal staples have been removed and replaced with
steri-strips. He has an abominal binder on to prevent him from
removing his J tube. He is still mildy anemic and will need to
have his complete blood count monitored as well as coagulation
studies. His coumadin had been discontinued on [**11-19**] for
elevated INR.  He did not have it resumed.  He did have repeat
complete blood count and INR sent prior to his discharge and
will need to have INR monitored prior to resuming his coumadin.
  He will follow up with the Acute Care Service in 2 weeks.
