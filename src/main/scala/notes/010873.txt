History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110**] is a 56 y/o woman with PMH notable for insulin-dependent
DM, ESRD on PD, and CAD s/p MI with stenting in [**2155**] who
presents to the ED with two-day history of left-sided pleuritic
chest pain, fever, and cough. The patient's husband served as
the interpreter during our encounter. The patient noted
left-sided lower rib pain about 2-3 days ago; she denies any
other myalgias. She has had poor PO intake and today vomited
twice, nonbloody. She has had fevers to 101.8 daily for the past
three days. She is not producing sputum. She is having trouble
lying flat to sleep due to left sided chest discomfort and
dyspnea. She has been performing her PD as directed (her husband
does this for her). Today, due to worsening pain and dyspnea as
well as vomiting, the patient's husband brought her to the [**Name (NI) **]
for evaulation.

Vitals on presentation to the ED were T 99.1 BP 193/92, HR 100,
92% on RA. She was noted to have a left-sided retrocardiac
infiltrate on cxr. She was treated with iv levofloxacin 750 gm X
1 and ceftriaxone 1 g IV X 1. She also received 1 g tylenol PR
and 2 mg morphine. Due to elevated blood sugars and anion gap,
she received 10 U regular insulin and was placed on an insulin
gtt. She received a total of 2 L NS in the ED. Blood pressures
improved to 150s/70s prior to transfer to the floor with pain
control.

On arrival to the ICU, the patient is sitting upright on bed.
She is complaining of [**7-30**] left sided chest pain, at the
inferior margin of the ribs, worse with inspiration. She denies
any headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, nasal congestion, sore
throat, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, or LE edema. She
has not eaten much in the past 48 hours. She had a bowel
movement yesterday but feels somewhat constipated. She denies
any sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] husband believes she got her flu shot
this year.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
* type II DM, now on insulin (lantus & humalog)
* ESRD on PD ([**1-21**] to DM, followed at [**Last Name (un) **], on transplant list)
* h/o anemia (intermittently given transfusions, on Epo)

CXR [**2158-11-28**]: Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity with
associated left pleural effusion consistent with pneumonia.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**12-1**] 1. Scattered foci of free air in the
abdomen and pelvis along with free fluid. The presence of a
peritoneal dialysis catheter and a recent peritoneal dialysis
procedure being performed likely explains the presence of free
air and free fluid. 2. Atrophic kidneys consistent with
end-stage renal disease. 3. No evidence for bowel dilatation. 4.
Areas of consolidation in the left lower lobe with small left
pleural effusion concerning for pneumonia.

Chest CT [**12-2**]: IMPRESSION: Cavitary lesion in the left lower
lobe which was not present on prior chest x-rays from [**11-28**], [**2157**] concerning for pulmonary abscess. Hydropneumothorax on
the left, possibly bronchopleural fistula. Left lower lobe
pneumonia with areas of left lung atelectasis. Patchy airspace
disease in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe, likely
endobronchial spread of infection. Ascites. Nodule left lobe of
thyroid. US recommended.

[**12-12**] TEE: Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
are complex (>4mm) nonmobile atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta to 40cm from the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation
is seen on the mitral valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: No vegetation or abscess seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 y/o F with a history of type II DM, Chronic kidnye disease,
on peritoneal dialysis who presents with left-sided infiltrate
and anion-gap hyperglycemia.

# PNEUMONIA/EMPYEMA: The patient was initially treated with
levofloxacin for community-acquired pneumonia. She was initially
on 5L oxygen by nasal cannula. Within 3-4 days, she no longer
needed oxygen. DFA for influenza was negative.  Urinary
legionella antigen could not be obtained as patient does not
void.  Legionella culture from sputum and sputum cultures were
pending. One blood culture from [**11-28**] grew MSSA, and patient was
additionally given Nafcillin.  She was treated with standing
nebulizers, tessalon perles, and guaifennasin with codeine for
cough. She complained of Left pleuritic rib pain, worse with
cough or deep inspiration, and her WBC count continued to rise.
Chest CT showed cavitary lesion in left lower lobe with air in
the pleura, concerning for bronchopleural fistula. To
investigate tuberculosis, PPD was negative and she had 3 induced
sputums sent for AFB smear and culture that were negative.
Interventional Pulmonary placed a pigtail catheter and
subsequently a chest tube [**12-4**]. On transfer to MICU thoracics
placed an addi
