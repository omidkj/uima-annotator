Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for anterior STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath with placement of Cypher stent
Temporary pacemaker x 2
Intra-aortic balloon pump
Pulmonary artery catheter


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1007**] is a 59yo woman with h/o discoid lupus admitted to OSH
on [**5-22**] with dyspnea and wheeze felt to be from asthma vs CHF;
although she initially reported 2 days of symptoms, on further
questioning, she reports feeling congested ever since her knee
surgery in [**Month (only) 547**]. Upon presentation, she was in NSR, but she
developed AFib with RVR to 160. She was ruled out for MI with
serial cardiac enzymes. Echo demonstrated EF 75% with LVH but no
atrial enlargement. She was started on lovenox and coumadin and
put on digoxin and diltiazem for rate control. Given concern for
volume overload, she received lasix. She was also put on
steroids briefly.

Shortly after lunch on [**5-26**], the patient complained of chest
pain and palpitations. Although she was initially in VTach, she
was coded for VFib/arrest and had CPR and then DCCV x 200J once.
She was started on lidocaine gtt and transferred to the ICU for
persistent VTach; amiodarone gtt was started. 12-lead EKG
revealed >10mm ST elevations in V3-V6 as well as 4mm STE in I.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath.

In the cath lab, she was maintained on amiodarone, lidocaine,
and neosynephrine drips and continued to be in AFib with
aberrancy with RVR; her systolic pressures did not drop below
80. Her LAD was found to be totally occluded and Cypher stent
was placed. Thrombus was identified in her first diag; she had
thrombectomy followed by POBA of D1. Hemodynamic measurements
were significant for LVEDP of 22 and PCWP of 22. Cardiac index
was calculated to be 1.35 l/min/m2 by Fick method, and IABP was
placed. She received a total of 180cc of contrast. Her blood
pressures improved with the IABP and her neosynephrine and
lidocaine drips were stopped. She also received plavix 600mg.

Upon arrival in the CCU, she had some right lower back pain,
[**5-30**]. She was on heparin, integrillin, and amiodarone gtt. She
denied any chest pain or dyspnea.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. She has had 2 miscarriages.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use: she smoked 39 years x 1 PPD; quit in [**2191**]. There is no
history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is a questionable family history of premature coronary
artery disease or sudden death: one of her sons died at age 17
of a [**Last Name **] problem which she is unable to clarify at this time.

Pertinent Results:
[**2199-5-26**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. There was a
total
occlusion at the bifurcation of the proximal LAD and a large D1
vessel.
The LMCA, LCx, and RCA were all patent.
2. Resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated an elevated left
sided
filling pressure with an LVEDP of 22 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 22
mmHg.
The RVEDP was mildly elevated at 12 mmHg. The mean PAP was
normal at 25
mmHg. Systemic arterial pressure was low at 96/64 mmHg while on
a
neosynephrine gtt. The Fick calculated cardiac index was low at
1.35
l/min/m2 consistent with cardiogenic [**Month/Day/Year **]. Pullback of the
catheter
across the aortic valve did not demonstrate a pressure gradient.

3. Due to persistent cardiogenic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] IABP was inserted
with marked
improvement in blood pressure.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a 3.0x
13 mm
CYPHER DES. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in
the
stent, no dissection and TIMI II flow.
5. Successful thrombectomy of the Diagonal and PTCA with a 2.5
mm
balloon. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the
diagonal, loss of a sidebranch and TIMI II flow (See PTCA
comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Anterior-Lateral STEMI with cardiogenic [**First Name3 (LF) **].
3. Successful placement of a DES to the LAD.
4. Successful placement of an IABP.

TTE [**2199-5-27**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near akinesis of the anterior septum and
anterior wall, distal lateral and inferior walls, and apex. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The estimated cardiac
index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD with right
ventricular infarction. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CT Abd/Pelvis without contrast [**2199-5-27**]: (done for concern of RP
bleed)
PRELIM READ--FINAL READ PENDING
Patchy hypodensities in the right kidney are suspicious for
infarct. Air in the kidney may represent post surgical change
but post infectuous air cause is also a possibility, recommend
correlation with urinalysisis and CBC. No retroperitoneal bleed.


CXR [**2199-5-27**]:
Single AP chest radiograph without comparison shows bibasilar
opacity which may represent atelectasis vs. aspiration. More
focal opacity in the right suprahilar region extending to the
apex may also represent aspiration, although mass lesion cannot
be entirely excluded and therefore recommend followup with PA
and lateral radiographs. The heart size is mildy enlarged. There
is no pleural effusion or evidence of CHF. The tip of
