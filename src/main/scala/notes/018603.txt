Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2174-3-7**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 24195**] is an 81-year old female with past medical history
of insulin dependent diabetes (>30 years), hypertension and
hyperlipidemia who presented with progressive shortness of
breath over one week's time.
.
Patient is accompanied by her two daughters and son. They report
patient had been in her usual state of health until
approximately 3 weeks ago, when she had a "stomach flu" that
caused her nausea, diarrhea and decreased oral intake. The
patient attempted to stay hydrated after this event by taking in
more fluids and eating "a lot of soup". She reports that for the
past two weeks, she has noted her ankles are swollen, worse at
nighttime. For the past week, she has been having episodes of
shortness of breath with less activity than usual and even
waking from sleep because she is unable to "get air" in. Patient
reports that for the past 3 days she has been needing two large
pillows to sleep more upight to help her breathing.
.
Today, patient reports she went to the supermarket but was
unable to do her shopping due to difficulty breathing. She
returned home and when speaking to her son, he noted she was
very winded on the phone and decided to take her in to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
Patient denies any chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, but
does report some tingling of the fingers in the right hand that
started a few days ago. Denies any cough, blood in stool,
syncope or presyncope. Denies any history of abnormal heart
rythms but does report she has a "hole in her heart" (PFO) for
which she is on daily coumadin.
.
At [**Hospital3 4107**], VS 98.3 96 142/74 16 4L NC% NRB. Patient
given IL NS, 20mg IV Lasix, aspirin (81mg), Atorvastatin 40mg
and tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Here in the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS: 97.7F, BP 135/67, HR 94, RR 26, O2 sat 94% on 4L
NC. Patient given regular insulin dose and admitted after
discussion with cardiology fellow. No heparin, plavix given. She
was maintained on a low dose nitroglycerin drip. On arrival to
the medical floor she was in no apparent distress and oxygen

[**2174-3-7**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
severe three vessel disease.  The LMCA was heavily calcified but
free of
critical stenoses.  The LAD had serial 99% lesions in the
proximal and
mid vessel. The LCx had a 90% origin lesion in a major OM1
branch and
was sub-totally occluded in its inferior pole, which filled via
left to
left collaterals.  The RCA had a 90% origin stenosis and 80%
stenosis at
the acute marginal branch; the distal vessel filled via
antegrade and
left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart
filling
pressures with a mean RA of 16mmHg and mean PCWP of 27mmHg.  The
LVEDP
was 35mmHg.  The cardiac index was preserved at 3.3l/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic biventricular dysfunction.
.
.
[**2174-3-7**] EKG: HR 80s, Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Consider
left atrial abnormality. Left bundle-branch block. Since the
previous tracing of [**2174-2-28**] the rate has decreased.
.
[**2174-3-5**] RENAL ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Simple appearing renal cysts
noted
bilaterally.
.
[**2174-3-2**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably severely depressed
(LVEF= 25-30 %). Despite limited image quality, there appears to
be global hypokinesis with inferior and infero-lateral akinesis.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
