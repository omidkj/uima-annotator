Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
79M w/ Parkinson's disease, CHF, HTN, and AS who presents today
from his nursing home with hypoxia.  Per report, he was in his
USOH until today when he had a mild nonproductive cough and
rhinorrhea.  At this time, he was not febrile and had no CP,
SOB, abdominal pain, N/V, diarrhea, rash, weakness, or dysuria.
Around 9:30pm he was check on in bed and found to have vomited.
His oxygen saturations were checked and he was hypoxic to 73% on
RA.  He did not come back to normal with supplemental oxygen and
eventually was placed on a non-rebreather with his oxygen levels
rising to 86%.  He continued to deny fever, chest pain,
abdominal pain, or other symptoms and had no further episodes of
emesis.  At baseline the wife reports that he is able to
recognize people but cannot follow a TV show plot, identify the
date, or engage in higher level thinking.  He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.
.
In our ED he was found to be hypoxic and his labs were
significant for only mild renal insufficiency.  His CXR showed a
? RML infiltrate vs CHF and he was given zosyn, CTX, and
clindamycin for a presumed aspiration event.  He was initially
DNR/DNI but his code status was changed to DNR/OK to intubate
after discussion with the patient and his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] was placed
on BiPAP and tolerated this well with an improved ABG and was
admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.
.
On the floor, he was tachypneic and sleepy but arousable and was
unable to be interviewed secondary to his mask.  He denied pain,
nausea, or SOB.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar atelectasis with superimposed consolidation likely
aspiration or pneumonia.
2. Probable tracheomalacia; for confirmation a dedicated CT
examination of the trachea would be recommended if clinically
warranted.
3. Incidental right adrenal gland lesion which is partially
enhancing and should be further evaluated by another examination
such as a dedicated adrenal MRI study or CT examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Respiratory failure - Patient was initially admitted to the
hospital and required intubation in the setting of respiratory
failure.  The patient had an aspiration pneumonia.  The patient
was noted to be positive for influenza and it was likely in this
setting that he vomited and aspirated causing the hypoxia noted
at his nursing home.  He had a difficult course of extubation
because of copious secretions.  A broncoscopy was performed
which showed some significant tracheitis.  There was a concern
for HSV infections.  He completed a course of steroids and
acyclovir for this tracheitis.  He also completed a course of
tamiflu and Vanc/Zosyn for his aspiration pneumonia.  All of
these were completed by the time of discharge.  He was extubated
and called out to the medicine floor on 3L NC.  His respiratory
status continued to improve and his oxygen requirement decrease.
 His oxygen will continue to be weaned at this long term care
facility.
.
#Cardiovascular - Patient was briefly hypotensive in unit,
requiring pressors in the setting of intubation.  His pressures
stablized and at the time of call out, he was restarted on his
midodrine.  His lasix was also resumed.  He does not appear
volume overloaded.
.
#Parkinsons's Disease - Continued home dosing of meds
.
#Nutrition - Patient had some difficulty swallowing after his
extubation. A NG tube was placed and he recieved tube feeds.
Speech and swallow saw the patient and cleared the patient for a
regular diet, now straws with 1:1 supervision and assistance as
needed.  He can also take whole pills in some puree.  His
nutritional status should be closely monitored at his long term
care facility to ensure he is taking enough nutrition.
.
#Incidental Findings on CT:  Patient noted to have a right
adrenal lesion.  The radiologists recommended a dedicated
adrenal MRI or CT scan for further evaluation.  Probably
tracheomalacia was also noted.  If needed, this could be further
evaluated in the future with a dedicated CT of the trachea.
These findings should be addressed and monitored by his primary
care physician.
.
#GERD - continued PPI
.
Code Status - DNR but ok to intubate
