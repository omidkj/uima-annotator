Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old female
with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid rate that
was refractory to medical therapy, that was ablated and had a
pacemaker placed.  History of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, history of esophageal cancer, status post
esophagectomy and history of left breast cancer, status post
mastectomy was recently discharged from [**Hospital3 **]
after pacemaker placement to the [**Hospital6 32395**] Home on
[**2131-1-6**].  She did well there but then one day prior
to admission developed nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  The
vomiting was bilious without blood or coffee grounds.  She
had a slightly low blood pressure of 80/50 and was slightly
short of breath with an oxygen saturation of 93% on 2 liters
and so was brought to the Emergency Room.  She was admitted
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen and
metered dose inhalers.
2.  Chronic pulmonary nodules, question pulmonary
hypertension versus chronic pulmonary embolism never been
diagnosed.
3.  Diastolic dysfunction.
4.  Atrial fibrillation with rapid rate, status post
atrioventricular junction ablation, and pacemaker placement
in [**2130-12-9**].  Normal thyroid function.  Echocardiogram
at an outside hospital per report showed [**Hospital1 **]-atrial
dilatation, trace mitral regurgitation and an ejection
fraction of 33%.
5.  Esophageal cancer, status post resection and
chemotherapy.
6.  Left breast cancer, status post mastectomy.
7.  Psoriasis.
8.  Anxiety/depression.
9.  Status post left total knee replacement.
10. Status post right ankle fusion for fracture.
11. Status post mastectomy as needed above.

Fragmin 6000 units subcutaneously b.i.d. until Coumadin is
therapeutic.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone in Chelsae without immediate
family but currently at Leespoint Nursing Center after
pacemaker placement for rehabilitation.  No smoking, alcohol
or illicit drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, she was pale and
ill-appearing but oriented times three with dry mucous
membranes.  Her blood pressure was 91/56, heartrate 81,
respiratory rate 23 sating 100% on 3 liters of nasal cannula.
She had pupils that were equal and reactive to light with
cataracts.  She was anicteric.  Her lungs had coarse sounds
with bilateral crackles at the bases.  Heart was regular with
no murmurs.  Her abdomen was soft with well healed scars and
no hepatosplenomegaly.  She had bowel sounds.  She had 1 to
2+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Her pacemaker site looked good
on her upper chest.  On neurological examination her cranial
nerves were intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission included a
white count of 13.3, hematocrit 25.8 down from 33 at
[**Hospital3 **] on [**12-26**].  Platelet count was
198.  Baseline BUN and creatinine were 20 and .7 but here was
32 and 2.0, sodium was 128, potassium 4.5, chloride 87 and
bicarbonate 23.  Glucose was 239.  She ruled out for
myocardial infarction.  Her urinalysis was negative.

Chest x-ray revealed a pacemaker and question of a left
retrocardiac density, collapse versus consolidation as well
as perhaps mild pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was diagnosed with hypotension
secondary to hypovolemia.  She was resuscitated with 2 units
of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids.  She was
found to be guaiac positive in the Emergency Room.  The
differential included Clostridium difficile versus
gastroenteritis.  Her Clostridium difficile was negative
times two.  Given the guaiac positive stools, she received
gastrointestinal workup.  After the 2 units her hematocrit
stabilized and she had no further decrease.  Her creatinine
improved with hydration with intravenous fluids back to her
baseline.  Her respiratory status improved with diuresis and
a steroid taper for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare as she was quite wheezy during admission.  She
remained afebrile and her rhythm remained paced.  She had had
a number of aspiration events in the past and so a video
swallow was obtained which revealed a mild to moderate
oropharyngeal dysphagia complicated by reduced bolus control
with formation that resulted in aspiration of thin liquids.
She was upgraded to a thin liquid, ground solid diet with her
pills whole or crushed in purees and aspiration precautions
including tucking chin to chest for all bites and sips,
alternating between solids and liquids and clearing the
throat and swallowing during the middle and end of the meal.
From the standpoint of her congestive heart failure
exacerbation she diuresed well with Lasix.  From the
standpoint of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, she
improved with nebulizers around the clock and steroid taper.
From the standpoint of her question of gastrointestinal
bleed, she received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy and
colonoscopy.  Her esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse
gastritis and a pulsating extrinsic bulge in the esophagus,
suggestive of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.  Her
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was otherwise normal.  The cause
of her guaiac positive stool was found on colonoscopy which
revealed two solitary rectal ulcers with no acute bleeding.
Cold forceps biopsies were performed.  The gastroenterologist
stated that they would follow up with her in three weeks with
regards to the results of the biopsies.  Given that she was
on anticoagulation only for atrial fibrillation, they
recommended holding anticoagulation until they saw and after
the results of the biopsy determine if she needs a repeat
endoscopy.  They also recommended a computerized tomographic
angiogram of the chest to evaluate for thoracic aortic
aneurysm.  She received this examination which revealed no
evidence of aortic aneurysm or dissection, although she had
diffuse aortic atherosclerotic disease.  It was consistent
with her diagnosis of congestive heart failure as she had
pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.  It was also
consistent with her history of esophagectomy as her stomach
lay in her thoracic cavity.  Incidental note was made of an
avid area of arterial enhancement within the caudate lobe of
the liver which most likely was a vascular shunt.  The
recommendation per Radiology was that further evaluation with
ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging scan on a
nonemergent basis is recommended if clinically warranted.
She has no clinical symptoms or concerns for such a finding.
Given her stable hematocrit and finding for the source of the
bleeding, she was prepared for discharge.
