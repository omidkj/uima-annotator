HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old man
with a longstanding history of alcohol abuse who presented
for a liver transplant on [**2174-8-25**].  The patient has been
abstaining from alcohol since [**2173**].  He first became
significantly symptomatic from his liver disease about three
to four years ago. His liver disease is complicated by
intractable ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, malnutrition, and
fatigue.  His history is also significant for falling down last
year which was complicated by a compartment syndrome in the right
leg status post fasciotomy.  On the day of admission, the patient
had no specific complaints except for some tingling in the right
foot.  He denied any recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, shortness of breath or chest pain.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
transplant surgery service.  He underwent orthotopic cadaver
liver transplant on [**2174-8-25**].  Intraoperatively, the patient
received 30 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of
platelets, 35 units of fresh frozen plasma, 30 units of Cryo.
The procedure was without complications.  Please see the full
operative report for details.  The patient remained intubated
and was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
immediately after the procedure.  The patient was started on
CellCept and Solu-Medrol.  He was also started on TPN.  The
patient also received prophylaxis with fluconazole, Bactrim,
Valcyte and Unasyn.  Cyclosporin was also added to the
immunosuppression regimen on postoperative day 1.  The
patient continued to be intubated in the SICU with good urine
output.  The patient was extubated on postoperative day 1.
His vital signs remained stable.  He appeared to tolerate the
extubation procedure well.

On [**2174-8-26**], a liver ultrasound was performed to evaluate
hepatic blood flow.  The ultrasound showed a patent portal
vein with antegrade flow, widely patent and hyperdynamic
hepatic venous flow.  Patent hepatic left artery.  However,
there was no detectable right hepatic artery signal detected. He
underwent a hepatic angiogram that demonstrated patency of the
left and right hepatic arteries as well as the accessory right
hepatic artery that was anastomosed to the stump of the splenic
artery of the donor. On postoperative day 1, while still in the
SICU, the patient received 150 mg of Cyclosporin via an
intravenous over a two hour period.  As a result, his serum
creatinine was noted to be increasing from 1.4 on postoperative
day 0 to a high of 2.4 on postoperative day 2 after he received
his intravenous Cyclosporin.  On postoperative day 1, status post
extubation, the patient appeared to have metabolic alkalosis. The
patient's urine output slowly recovered.  An echocardiogram
was obtained on [**2174-8-29**] which showed overall left
ventricular systolic function moderately depressed.  The
patient also underwent a bronchoscopy which showed
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  A liver
ultrasound was repeated on [**2174-8-29**].  As before, arterial
flow could not be demonstrated in the segments of the right
lobe of the liver.  However, arterial flow was seen within
the left lobe of the liver.

The patient also had a series of chest x-rays obtained while
in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit which showed congestive
heart failure which slowly resolved over time.  Being
reintubated for possible aspiration pneumonia, the patient
was maintained on vancomycin and clindamycin.  The patient
was again extubated on postoperative day 5 which he tolerated
well.  The patient was continued on TPN.  The patient was
continued on immunosuppression medication which included
Solu-Medrol, Neoral and CellCept.  His chest tube was removed
on postoperative day 8.  He remained somewhat confused above
his baseline.  On the same day, he was transferred to the
regular transplant floor.  A repeat chest x-ray obtained on
[**2174-9-3**] showed no acute cardiopulmonary changes.  Due to the
continued confusion, psychiatry consult was obtained.  Per
their recommendations, Haldol was used with good response.
The liver function tests continued to improve.

On postoperative day 10, the patient was noted to be more
confused and had an increasing white blood cell count.  Urine
and blood cultures were obtained which showed no growth.  His
chest x-ray was clear as well.  The patient's kidneys
regained function after intravenous Cyclosporin with serum
creatinine dropping to 0.8 on postoperative day 10.  All
antibiotics were discontinued.  The TPN was slowly weaned,
and the patient was eventually able to tolerate po's.  The
patient also had diarrhea, but his Clostridium difficile test
was negative.

On postoperative day 12, the patient complained of increasing
pain in the periumbilical region where he has a known
umbilical hernia.  The hernia was reduced manually with some
relief to the patient.  On [**2174-9-9**], the patient went to the
Operating Room for the repair of his umbilical hernia.  He
tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.
Please see the full operative for full details.  On the same
day, the patient was also noted to be hyperkalemic with a
serum potassium of 6.0.  The patient continued to be
persistently hyperkalemic on [**9-10**] and 18th, which had
to be corrected on several occasions.  In addition, on
postoperative day 16 and 2, the patient was noted to have
increasing liver function tests, with alkaline phosphatase
increasing to 546, total bilirubin increasing to 3.3.

On [**2174-9-12**], the patient received no Neoral due to the
concern that his rising liver function tests and his
hyperkalemia were due to increased Cyclosporin levels.  The
patient's hyperkalemia ultimately improved.  His liver
function tests improved as well.  Given concern for an acute
rejection of his new liver, a liver ultrasound was obtained
on [**2174-9-11**].  The ultrasound showed patent portal veins and
hepatic arteries with normal flow.  The left hepatic vein
could not be visualized due to technical limitations of the
study.  The s
