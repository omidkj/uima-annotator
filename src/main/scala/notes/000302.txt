History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76674**] is a 44 year old male who was diagnosed with rectal
abscess and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus aortic valve
endocarditis on [**2151-10-15**]. He completed a course of Flagyl and
Ceftriaxone. Serial echocardiograms showed severe AI with a L->R
shunt from the sinus of valsalva to right ventricle. At time of
admission, he reported worsening fatigue associated with
shortness of breath with minimal activity and frequent
palpitations. He was admitted for further evaluation and
treatment.

[**2151-10-15**].

Family History:
Denies any family history of premature CAD. States his father
had an MI in his 70s, still living. Possible CAD on his mother's
side of the family. No history of known sudden death.


Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 113-133/31-41 mm Hg while seated.  Pulse was
109 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well
groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and time. The
patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.

There was pale conjunctiva without cyanosis of the oral mucosa.
The neck was supple with JVP of 8 cm.  The carotid waveform was
normal.  There was no thyromegaly. The were no chest wall
deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.  The respirations were not
labored and there were no use of accessory muscles. The lungs
has
bibasilar rales.

Palpation of the heart revealed a prominent PMI.  There were no
thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4.  He is tachycardic with a
[**1-20**] holosystolic murmur best appreciated at LUSB. The abdominal
aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

[**2151-11-17**] Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease in the
LMCA, LAD, LCx, and RCA (although coronaries could not be well
opacified due to severe aortic regurgitation).
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated left and
right sided filling pressures with mean PCW of 21 mmHg and RVEDP
of 25 mmHg. There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension
with PASP of 66 mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 3.2
L/min/m2. There was normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP
of 114 mmHg and DBP of 56 mmHg. There was a left-to right shunt
with oxygen step-up at RV flow and a possible fistula from sinus
of Valsalva to RV demonstrated by selective injection and
supravalvular aortography.
[**2151-11-17**] TEE:
Right ventricular systolic function is normal. Overall left
ventricular function is normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 45 cm from the incisors. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. There is a moderate to large sized
vegetation on the aortic valve involving the right and
non-coronary cusps. The vegetation measures 0.4cm x 1.5cm. The
left coronary cusp is moderately thickened. There is no aortic
root abcess cavity seen. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is
seen with reversal of flow in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is prominent color flow in the area of the right coronary
cusp which may represent a sinus of valsalva fistula (aortic
root to RA/RVOT). The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
[**2151-11-18**] Abdominal CT Scan:
1. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Right upper quadrant pericolonic and peripancreatic
induration at least some of which may be secondary to known
previous procedures. This may represent recurrent or acute
pancreatitis and as patient cannot receive contrast, MRI may
also be informative. Note also higher density contents of right
colon (question intraluminal blood) compared to the remainder
bowel. Is patient guaiac positive?
3. Persistent contrast opacification kidneys, now greater than
24 hours past contrast administration indicative of ATN. Note
additional density abnormality right lateral kidney. ?is this
site of patient's previous known RF ablation for renal cell
cancer?
4. Small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid and
small-to-moderate size right pleural effusion, neither of which
measure blood density.
5. Mildly enlarged spleen.
6. Diverticulosis.
[**2151-11-21**] Chest/Abdominal CT Scan:
1. Large areas of consolidation seen within the lungs
bilaterally, with air bronchograms, concerning for infection.
2. New diffuse patchy ground-glass airspace opacities seen
bilaterally, right greater than the left. 3. No evidence of
retroperitoneal hematoma. Small amount of nonspecific free fluid
in pelvis. Stranding in pelvic soft tissues possibly represent
small amount of interstitial hemorrhage.
4. Post-operative changes seen within the chest, with multiple
lines and tubes. Pneumomediastinum and small bilateral
pneumothoraces seen, consistent with post-operative changes.
[**2151-11-22**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve appears to be a homograft. The
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet
motion and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-11-27**] 10:46 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: check atel

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
44 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
check atel
CLINICAL HISTORY: Pacer placed, check for pneumothorax, unable
to raise left arm.

CHEST: The position of the pacemaker is unchanged. No
pneumothorax is present. The left lung appears clear.

Patchy opacities are again noted within the right lung, not
significantly changed since the prior chest x-ray of [**11-25**]. These probably represent areas of pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: No significant change since [**11-25**].
