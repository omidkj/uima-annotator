Service:  CCU
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is an 85-year-old female with a
history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft with saphenous vein graft to LAD,
saphenous vein graft to D1, saphenous vein graft to OM1,
saphenous vein graft to [**Hospital **] transferred from outside hospital

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient in usual state of
health until morning of admission when she developed
substernal chest pain at 4 o'clock in the morning, was unable
to fall back asleep.  The patient got out of bed and at 6
a.m. chest pain worsened.  The patient denied associated
shortness of breath or diaphoresis.  She was brought to the
elevations in posterior leads on electrocardiogram.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for cardiac
catheterization.  Catheterization showed total occlusion of
saphenous vein graft to OM graft with thrombus.  Anterior jet
clot removal with percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stent x6 was unsuccessful with no reflow in
OM territory.  Saphenous vein graft to LAD graft was patent.
Saphenous vein graft to diagonal with proximal stenosis.
Retrograde filling of territory by LAD.  RCA graft not
patent, but with good collateral filling.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in '[**90**]

3.  Status post pacemaker
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease
5.  History of breast cancer, status post right lumpectomy
6.  History of endometrial cancer, status post total
abdominal hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
7.  Vertigo, status post cataract surgery

HOME MEDICATIONS (doses unknown):
1.  Lopressor
2.  Digoxin
3.  Lipitor

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with husband.  Daughter [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 39752**]
and son [**Name (NI) 122**] [**Name (NI) 39753**] are contact family members.   History

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 77, blood pressure 144/83, respirations
16, saturating 98% on 2 liters
GENERAL:  Patient elderly, pale in no acute distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Surgical pupils
bilaterally.  Mucous membranes slightly dry.
NECK:  Supple, no jugular venous distention, no bruits.
HEART:  Regular with normal S1 and S2, grade 2/6 systolic
ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border.
PULMONARY:  Coarse breath sounds bilaterally anteriorly.  No
wheezing.
ABDOMEN:  Normal bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, 2+ DPs bilaterally.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

LABS FROM OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  White count 9.7, hematocrit 386,
platelets 273.  INR 1.1, sodium 134, potassium 2.6, chloride
99, bicarbonate 26, BUN 20, creatinine 1.1, glucose 148.
Digoxin level 0.5.  CK 37, troponin 0.22.  Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm at 85, left axis deviation, right
bundle branch block, ST depressions and T-wave inversions in
V1 through V2, as well as 2, 3 and F.  Posterior leads with 2
to [**Street Address(2) 2051**] elevation.  Right sided cardiac catheterization
showed an outpatient of 3.36, index 2.02, RA [**10-15**], RV 22/8,
PA pressure 29/50 with a wedge of 60.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient is status post
posterior myocardial infarction with unsuccessful
intervention.  The patient was maintained on aspirin, Plavix
and Lipitor.

2.  MYOCARDIUM:  The patient obtained a cardiac
echocardiogram to evaluate her LV function and it showed
moderately depressed systolic function with an ejection
fraction of 35% to 40%, posterior akinesis and severe lateral
and apical hypokinesis, moderate 2+ mitral regurgitation.
The patient was started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.

3.  EP:  The patient continued to have rounds of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia seven days after her myocardial
infarction.  EP was consulted for placement of AICD.
Decision regarding defibrillator is still pending.

4.  ANEMIA:  The patient had estimated blood loss of about 1
liter in the catheterization lab.  The patient was transfused
several units of blood with stabilization of her hematocrit.

5.  The patient was seen by physical therapy who recommended
a short term rehabilitation.

6.  PULMONARY:  During hospitalization, the patient had an
episode of hypoxia the 55% on room air.  The patient looked
clinically comfortable.  The patient denied shortness of
breath.  The patient was not tachypneic.  The patient did
have rales on exam a third of the way up bilaterally.  The
patient was treated with intravenous Lasix and maintained on
BIPAP with improvement of her oxygenation.  With diuresis,
the patient was able to be weaned off her oxygen.  The
angiogram was obtained which was negative for pulmonary
embolism.  It is presumed that the patient might have some
underlying lung disease since her degree of hypoxia did not
correlate with her degree of congestive heart failure.  The
patient also received intravenous nitroglycerin during her
episode of acute pulmonary edema which was gradually weaned
off.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable
