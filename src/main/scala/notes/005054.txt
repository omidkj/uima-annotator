Allergies:
Ceftriaxone / Oxycodone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Free intraperitoneal air and abdominal pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Exploratory laparotomy, right hemicolectomy, end ileostomy and
Hartmann's pouch.


History of Present Illness:
Per initial surgical HPI:
55M recently discharged after work up for bilateral thalamic
stroke, PNA, line infection, NJ feeding tube placement, and UTI,
was intubated briefly at that time.  Now presenting as transfer
from OSH with reports of free air, was presumably seen there
from rehab.  Unable to answer questions coherently.

Medicine Team HPI on [**2192-12-11**] upon transfer to floor which
partly summarizes hospital course prior to transfer
Briefly, patient is a 55M with hx of morbid obesity, type II DM,
OSA on BiPAP, with a very complicated 2 month hospital course
s/p Cardiac Arrest on [**11-21**] transferred to the unit for MRSA HAP.
In the unit, patient had JP drain placed in an abdominal
abscess. He also had a Hct drop with no clear source and had a
negative abdominal CT. His Hct has been stable at 25. He also
developed a UTI and was started on diflucan.

Pt initially presented on [**9-13**] with acute change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
weakness, and was found to have bilateral thalamic, and L
cerebral peduncle infarcts, transferred to the floor and
discharged to rehab (see prior DC summary for details related to
initial hospital course). Pt re-admitted on [**10-14**] and found to
have intra-peritoneal air and abdominal pain, was taken to the
OR and found to have perforated Cecum thought to be secondary to
[**Last Name (un) **] syndrome.  He had right hemicolectomy and end ileostomy
with Hartmann's patch.
.
His post-op course was complicated by abdominal abscess. The pt
developed purulence at his op site and wound was opened and
cultured. He was started on Vancomycin on [**10-23**]. Cultures grew
MRSA and VRE. CT abd showed large fluid collection. He was
intubated on [**10-28**] for inability to manage airway secretions and
was started on zosyn. CT abd on [**10-30**] again showed an organizing
fluid collection R hepatic flex to pelvis and on [**10-31**] the
collection was drained. Fluid grew VRE. He was continued on
antibiotics. He also had sputum cultures on [**10-27**] and [**10-28**] with
MRSA. In addition CT scan [**2192-11-6**] to evaluate his fluid
collections showed an SMV clot. Hematology was consulted and
hypercoag labs were sent and he was anticoagulated with heparin
bridged to COumadin.
.
On [**11-20**] pt had CT abd w/ PO contrast via Dobhoff tube for
re-eval of abdominal abscess/leak that was drained by a pigtail.
Overnight pt triggered for tachypnea and subsequently
transferred from East to [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] to the TICU. On arrival to
the TICU the pt was in respiratory distress. He was emergently
intubated. Following intubation he suffered a cardiac arrest
with pulseless VT responding to epi X3. Down time estimated at 5
minutes. He underwent a bronchoscopy on [**11-21**] with cultures
growing coag + staph. He was started on Vancomycin and Levaquin.
Pt now transferred to the MICU for further medical management.

Pt was admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **], following transfer from TICU
during which he suffered a cardiac arrest. The pt was intubated
and sedated on arrival for Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
thought to be secondary to mucous plugging. The patient was
weaned off the vent over the course of his first day and was
subsequently extubated without complications. The pt was placed
on scoop mask and subsequently transferred to the floor with a
2-3L O2 requirment.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**11-26**] during which
time his mental status began to clear. He had been
intermittently oriented to [**2192-11-14**] and could discuss the
[**Company **]. He received multiple debridements of a sacral ulcer
that had been present since his original surgery. A wound
culture from [**11-27**] grew e.coli and enterococcus and Zosyn was
added to his regimen on [**11-30**]. Of note, his percutaneous
drainage tube was removed on [**12-1**] after multiple days of <5cc
drainage. On [**12-2**], the patient developed fevers to 100-101.
Standard infectious work up was negative with unchanged CXR,
negative blood cultures, and U/A with only yeast. ID was
consulted and Zosyn was changed to Meropenem out of concern for
drug fever on [**12-3**]. However, the patient continued to have
fevers. The evening of [**12-5**], the patient had an episode of
tachypnea to the 30s without new hypoxia or acidosis on ABG,
which resolved by morning. Later he was sent for a repeat CT
Torso to evaluate for potential worsening of his abscess. This
showed a large and worsened phlegmon at the site of the previous
pigtail with a new fluid collection. Upon returning from CT, he
was tachycardic to the 130s-140s (sinus) and tachypnic with
worsened abdominal pain. Surgery was called but felt his abdomen
did not require surgical intervention. He received 1L NS and
10mg PO vit K for a potential IR drainage procedure in the am.
He denied chest pain, worsened SOB, N/V. He was not hypotensive
and an ABG confirmed the lack of acidosis.
.
In the MICU, the patient had JP drain placed in an abdominal
abscess. He also had a Hct drop with no clear source and had a
negative abdominal CT. His Hct has been stable at 25 for two
days at time of transfer. He also developed a UTI and was
started on diflucan.
