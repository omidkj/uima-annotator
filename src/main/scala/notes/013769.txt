Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Hospital 82594**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of pulmonary
hypertension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement.
Swan-Ganz catheter placement.

History of Present Illness:
  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year-old woman with history of polycythemia
[**Doctor First Name **] on hydroxyurea, Raynaud's phenomena, hypertension,
transferred from OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2106-11-11**] for workup of new
hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension.

  She was in her usual state of health until approximately one
month ago, when she began experiencing fatigue with exercise.
Prior to one month ago, she was able to climb a flight of stairs
without difficulty and walk several blocks, denying any exercise
limitation.  She was working for her son in a gift shop until 3
weeks ago, at which time she began to note dyspnea with
climibing one flight of stairs at her home and that she needed
to take frequent breaks from what were typically small domestic
tasks.

  Other symptoms included mild ankle edema, and "swollen
abdomen" noted by her PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] notes generally poor appetite
with little interest in food.  Her PCP ordered [**Name Initial (PRE) **] chest x-ray and
started her on ciprofloxacin for pneumonia (per patient). She
was also referred for an TTE due to pleural effusions, which
revealed a markedly dilated right ventricle, moderate aortic
regurgitation and moderate mitral regurgitation.

  At [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, she underwent chest CTA which was
negative for PE.  There was a right sided effusion which was
tapped with results consistent with transudate.  Also noted to
have mediastinal adenopathy.  During her hospitalization,
patient was found to have acute kidney injury and per nephrology
consutation felt to be secondary to poor renal perfusion from
impaired left ventricular filling. Patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for futher management.  She was also initiated on CAP
treatment with levofloxacin, which was completed at transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management and work-up of her hypoxemia and
pulmonary hypertension.

  Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**] she was hemodynamically stable at direct
admission to the floor.  She remained hemodynamically stable
with an oxygen requirement of 4 LPM.  She had repeat CT scan of
the chest without contrast and a repeat ECHO.  These findings
confirmed OSH results with TR gradient 56-64, severe TR, mild
MR, mild LVH, RVH, marked RV dilation with abnormal septal
motion.  Pulmonary and cardiology were consulted and she
underwent pulmonary artery catheter placement for planned close
monitoring, trial of potential vasodilator drugs and diuresis in
the ICU.  Also has noted dark urine since arrival to [**Hospital1 18**],
along with abdominal pain in her LUQ to LLQ, which felt like a
"toothache" to her.  It was not colicky in nature and resolved
spontaneously.

Review of systems
  Denies snoring or nightime dyspnea or awakenings though notes
her "son thinks I have sleep apnea" for unclear reasons.
  Denies fever, chest pain, syncope or lightheadedness, bleeding
episodes, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting prior to coming to
hospital.  Denies headache,  weight loss, night sweats or fever.

thromboembolic disease.
  History of blood transfusion with delivery of child 50 years
ago.
