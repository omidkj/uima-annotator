History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19420**] is a 42 year old male with a history of end stage
liver disease on the [**Known lastname **] list, pulmonary hypertension who
presents from home with fevers and hypotension. Per his mother
he was in his usual state of health until the afternoon of
presentation. He walked around the house this afternoon and
watched tv. She noticed that his forehead was hot at around noon
and took his temperature and it was elevated at 103. He did not
have any specific complaints. Since his most recent
hospitalization for hepatorenal syndrome his only medication
change has been restarting lasix. He had a therapeutic
paracentesis on [**2148-6-18**] with removal of 8.5 liters of fluid. He
has been taking his lactulose as schedule although he had fewer
than normal bowel movements yesterday and so his dose was
increased with good effect today. He has continued on his tube
feeds for supplemental nutrition. He has not had any other
fevers. He has not been complaining of cough, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria or
leg pain. His lower extremity edema is at baseline. All other
review fo systems negative in detail.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 103.0 P: 140 BP: not detectable
R: 26 O2 sat 93% on RA. He received 4 liters of normal saline
for resuscitation. Lacatate was elevated at 6.7 with normal pH.
His creatinine was 1.8 from baseline of 1.4. WBC count was 12.0
with 14% bands. Total bilirubin was slightly elevated from
baseline at 12.2. He had a CXR which showed very small lung
volumes but no definite acute process. He had a diagnostic
paracentesis without evidence of SBP. He received vancomycin and
ceftriaxone. He received 60 meq of potassium. He had blood and
urine cultures sent. He was transferred to the MICU for further
management.
.
On arrival to the MICU he is confused but has no complaints. He
is alert and talkative.
