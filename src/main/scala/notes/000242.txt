History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year old male with PMH significant for CAD s/p
CABG in [**2089**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1 and SVG to RCA), DM2 and
critical AS s/p balloon valvuloplasty [**8-22**] with valve area
improvement from 0.6 to 0.74.  He was recently discharged from
the hospital on [**8-24**].  He reports feeling well and gaining
strength the first week after discharge but for the past week
has been getting dizzy and shortness of breath with minimal
activity.  Visting nurse has noted approximately 14 lbs weight
gain since discharge three weeks ago.  He got dizzy while tying
his shoes today which finally prompted him to come to ER at OSH
where he was noted to have pulmonary edema on exam, CE -ve x 1.
He was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his
decompensated heart failure secondary to his severe aortic
stenosis.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath ([**2107-9-20**]): 1. Resting hemodynamics revealed
moderately elevated right and left sided filling pressures with
an RVEDP of 13mmHg and LVEDP of 21mmHg. There was
moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with
a PASP of 68mmHg. The cardiac index was mildly reduced at
2.11L/min/m2. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Mildly elevated right and left
sided filling pressures. 2. Pulmonary hypertension and
moderately elevated PVR

LE US ([**2107-9-25**]): No evidence of DVT in the left lower
extremity. Probable hematoma extending from the anterior upper
to mid calf. Clinical correlation advised.

Echo ([**2107-9-26**]) PREBYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50 %). There is hypokinesis of the
inferior and septal walls. Right ventricular systolic function
is normal with normal free wall contractility. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with some
restriction of both the anterior and posterior leaflets.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 3D imaging
reveals failure of coaptation between the A3 and P3 leaflets.
There is mild tricuspid regurgitation. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is a left pleural effusion. POSTBYPASS: The
patient is A-paced on epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions.
Left ventricular systolic function is improved with the inotrope
(LVEF 50-55%). Hypokinesis of the inferior and septal walls
persists. Right ventricular systolic function is now mildly
depressed. Mild tricuspid regurgitation persists. There is a new
aortic bioprosthetic valve which is well seated with good
leaflet excursion. Peak/mean gradients are 15/7 mmHg. The aortic
valve area was calculated to be 1.5 cm2. There is trace aortic
regurgitation which is central. There are no perivalvular leaks.
Mitral regurgitation is now moderate (2+). Aortic contours are
normal. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was informed of the results at the time of the
study.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male with past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease s/p coronary artery bypass graft in [**2089**]
(LIMA to LAD, SVG to D1 and SVG to RCA), diabetes mellitus and
critical Aortic Stenosis s/p balloon valvuloplasty on [**8-22**] with
valve area improvement from 0.6 to 0.74. He was admitted with
decompensated heart failure (acute on chronic) secondary to his
severe aortic stenosis. Upon admission he was medically managed
for his heart failure and aggressively diuresed. with vast
improvement in peripheral and pulmonary edema prior to surgery.
He was also treated for his previous history of Atrial
fibrillation. He received Amiodarone and beta-blockers daily and
was transition from Coumadin to Heparin for anticoagulation.
Diabetes management was also closely monitored and [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted for management due to his insulin resistant state and
variable diet. On [**9-20**] he underwent a right heart cath to
evaluate volume status and PA hypertension prior to aortic valve
replacement. Cath revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
filling pressures. Along with pulmonary hypertension and
moderately elevated PVR. On [**9-21**] he underwent a TEE to further
assess his mitral valve. Echo revealed moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation. On this day cardiac surgery was consulted
and he required a few additional lab studies prior to surgery.
Mr. [**Known lastname 25307**] developed a right thigh hematoma post-cath with
difficulty with leg flexibility. Ultrasound revealed a thigh
hematoma. Orthopaedics was consulted to evaluate for compartment
syndrome. Orthopaedics evaluation was negative for compartment
syndrome and patient received pain management. IV Heparin was
discontinued before surgery due to this hematoma and he was
cleared for surgery on [**9-26**]. On this day he underwent a
redo-sternotomy, aortic valve replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
but critical condition (titrated on propofol, epinephrine,and
phenylephrine drips). Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Immediately
post-op pulmonary was consulted for
