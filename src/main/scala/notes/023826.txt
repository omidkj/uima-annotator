wound infection so did not recommend any antibiotics but
recommended CT imaging of T-spine. Labs drawn significant for
hyponatremia with Na 126, hyperkalemia K 5.5, and WBC 19.2
(around his recent baseline) with 9 bands. Ulytes showed FeNa<1

touch intact. Reflexes 1+

Pertinent Results:
Ct spine [**2-8**]
1.  Post-operative changes in the thoracic region with
improvement in thoracic kyphosis since the following surgery and
stabilization.  At T5 level, no evidence of compression of the
thecal sac is visualized on the current study with persistent
lytic abnormality in the left pedicle of L5 and involving the
articular processes.
2.  Fluid collection at the upper end of the laminectomy at
C7-T1 level with small air bubbles without enhancement in the
surrounding soft tissues could be a post-operative fluid
collection.  However, clinical correlation recommended as
infection cannot be excluded entirely on the CT appearances.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo M with metastatic renal CA to T spine s/p T1-T12 fusion,
with non-healing wound complicated by MSSA, s/p latissimus and
trapezius flap on [**2194-2-20**].
.
Pt presented with fever, elevated WBC, ESR and CRP, increasing
drainage from surcial wound and signs of infection in C7-T1 area
on CT.  Thoracic wound was debrided on [**2194-2-9**] and [**2194-2-14**].
Wound cx showed MSSA and pt was started on nafcillin.  Blood
cultures remained negative, and ECHO showed no vegetations on
TTE.  Pt had portacath removed to ensure not nidus of infection.
 On [**2194-2-20**] wound was repaired with latissimus and trapezius flap
and pt transfered to plastic surgery.  Pt followed usual post-op
course with adequate healing of spinal wound.  Nafcillin to be
continued for 6 weeks at 2 gm q4hr.
.
#. Hyponatremia - Pt with previous history of hyponatremia, and
is at risk of SIADH given cancer and SSRI use. Improved with
fluid restriction. Nephrology followed throught pt stay
.
# HAP - Pt febrile with RLL infiltrate on CXR on [**2-26**].  Pt
started on Levofloxacin to treat HAP continued for 10 days.  ID
was consulted and followed throughout stay.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - Platelet drop greater than 50% with current
nadir of 58. HIT positive, but OD equivocal, 0.7. Serotonin
release assay negative. Therefore negative for HIT.  Platelets
subsequently improved through hospitalization
.
#. Altered mental status - AAOx3. No change in mental status. No
masses/mets/bleed on CT head.
