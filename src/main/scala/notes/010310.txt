pneumothorax. Post- esophagectomy changes are present within the
mediastinum with a mediastinal drain present. A right subclavian
catheter tip terminates within the low right atrium. Platelike
atelectasis within the left lung base. Osseous structures are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: New small right apical pneumothorax status post
right chest tube removal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs.[**Known lastname 73898**] was admitted on [**2167-9-22**] and underwent successful
transthoracic esophagectomy (3-hole), hand sewn anastomosis,
flex bronch, EGD, RLL wedge resection for pulmonary infarct.
She was taken to the ICU intubated and extubated without
difficulty.  An epidural was placed for pain and managed by the
pain service. She had a foley, right chest tube, JP drain and an
NG to suction.  The J-tube remained to gravity.  Postoperative
day #1 she was volume depleted and bolused with 2 liters of
fluid with a good result.  She was started on a beta-blocker to
prevent atrial fibrillation. On postoperative day #2 she
transferred to the floor in stable condition.  An incidental
pulmonary infarction was seen in the operating room and a lower
extremity ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis.
Physical therapy was consulted and she began to ambulate in the
halls.  Her tube-feeds were restarted. On postoperative day #3
nutrition was consulted.  She was transfused with 2 units
pack-red blood cells for a hematocrit of 21.0 to a hematocrit of
27.  Her epidural was replaced, a PCA was started for better
pain control.  On postoperative day #4 the NG was removed.  She
denied nausea.  Her tube-feeds remained at 30cc/hr until her
bowel function returned.  On postoperative day #5 the epidural
and PCA were removed.  She was converted to J-tube pain
medication with good control. The chest-tube was removed on
postoperative day #7 ([**2167-9-29**]).  Her bowel function returned
and her tube feeds were advanced to a goal of 70cc/hr.  The JP
drain was removed on postoperative day #8.  There was no
incisional leak with grape juice and she was started on clear
liquids which she tolerated.  On postoperative day #9 she was
discharged to home.  She was hemodynamically stable, in sinus
rhythm, tolerating tube-feeds at goal on a full liquid diet.
She will have a barium swallow as an outpatient and follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
