Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with a history of dCHF, severe CAD s/p CABG ([**2146**] and
[**2156**]) LIMA->LAD, SVG->LPLB (posterior left ventricular branch),
with numerous PCI's, most recently in [**2166**]. Last PCI [**2167-11-25**]
showed native 3VD, multiple SVG->LPL stenoses, patent LIMA->LAD,
a stent was placed to mid, prox, ostial
SVG (to LPL).  He has been managed medically since then.
.
For the past 1-2 weeks, patient has had upper back pain which he
describes as either sharp or pressure.  It has been on and off,
and he has a hard time describing what makes it better or worse.
 This is quite different from his usual angina, which he hasn't
experienced since his last hospitalization in [**2171-1-27**].   He
saw his Cardiologist on [**8-28**]. This pain was thought to be
musculoskeletal. He denied any other symptoms of orthopnea, PND,
or LE edema, and lungs were clear at that time. [**8-30**] he called
his PCP complaining of SOB. He was instructed to take an
additional lasix.
.
On [**8-30**] patient noticed more dyspnea on exertion just walking
around his [**Last Name (un) **] and getting into bed. He felt like his legs
were heavy, and he was having trouble moving around. Denies any
CP, diaphoresis, nausea, or associated back pain. He called EMS
at that time.  EMS administered full dose [**Last Name (un) **], SL nitro x2, and
40mg IV lasix.
.
At baseline, he does not have LE edema, orthopnea, or PND.
Denies fevers, chills, diarrhea, dysuria. Has had more of a
cough recently.
.
Per family, pharmacy accidentally filled imdur bottle with
carvedilol for the past month.
.
.

.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of  bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of  paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.

.
In the ED, vitals were  HR 62 BP 120/47 RR 11 100% on Bipap
(FiO2 of 40%). He was started on a nitro gtt, given IV morphine
and 40mg IV lasix. EKG was unchanged from baseline. He is being
admitted to the CCU for non invasive ventilation, however Bipap
was weaned off on transfer from the ED.

ECHO [**2171-9-2**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal [**Month/Day/Year 23115**] is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild
regioanl LV systolic dsyfunciton with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. The remaining segments are dynamic. There is no
ventricular septal [**Month/Day/Year 23115**]. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-2-22**],
the LVEF appears slightly better (infero-lateral near akinesis
was present on the prior study but not reported). Otherwise no
change.
.
CXR [**9-6**]:
 Interval decrease in extent of perihilar alveolar opacities
consistent with improving edema. Small right pleural effusion
has also
decreased in the interval. Left retrocardiac opacity, presumably
representing
a combination of atelectasis and effusion, has not appreciably
changed.
.
EKG [**9-2**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Non-specific intraventricular
conduction
delay. Tiny R waves in the inferior leads consistent with
possible inferior
infarction. Tiny R waves in the anterior leads consistent with
possible
prior anterior wall myocardial infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing no
significant change.
.
All micro date negative: Positive MRSA by nasal swab


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with a history of dCHF, severe CAD s/p CABG who presents
with worsening dyspnea on exertion, associated with orthopnea,
and lower extremity edema. Patient treated for acute
exacerbation of CHF, primarily through diuresis.

# Acute on Chronic Diastolic congestive Heart Failure<br>
Echo from [**2171-1-27**] showed normal systolic function with
diastolic dysfunction. Pt was started on lasix gtt with poor
response, then required bumex gtt to diurese. Started on bumex
PO again after ARF resolving. On RA with good sats. Not
orthostatic
