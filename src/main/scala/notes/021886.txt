Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted for right heart catherterization with nitrous oxide in
preparation/work up for mitral valve replacement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
48M with severe MR, EF30% on cath in [**4-/2173**], DMII, HTN, ESRD on
HD, s/p RHC with failed vasodilator challenge for his pulmonary
hypertension. He was admitted as part of workup for possible MV
replacement. He is also awaiting kidney transplant, he is being
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14611**] at B&W for kidney transplant. The plan is
currently for him to have the MV repair first and then the
kidney transplant. He is admitted to CCU with Swan in place
after RHC for aggressive HD to reduce PAP.


Past Medical History:
Severe MR
EF30% on cath in [**4-/2173**]
DMII
HTN
ESRD on HD (Nephrologist is Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**], HD on MWF)
S/P Right hand surgeries


Social History:
Quit tob 20 yrs ago, 10 yr pack year history. No ETOH, No IVDA.
Lives with wife, 2 kids. Used to be industrial mechanic.


Family History:
No premature CAD

Physical Exam:
97.5, 129/83, 92, 24, 92-97% 3L NC
PAP 90/40
GENL: NAD
HEENT: JVP
CV: RRR +systolic and +diastolic murmur
LUNG: CTAB
ABD: soft, nt, nd, +bs
Ext: 1+ pedal pulses.
Neuro: A&O x3.


Pertinent Results:
Echo [**3-/2173**]: Severe mitral regurgitation with mildly thickened
leaflets but no systolc prolapse, flail leaflet, or vegetation.
Low normal left ventricular systolic function. Right ventricular
cavity enlargement/free wall hypokinesis suggestive of pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
-
RHC [**2173-9-28**]:
1. Severe pulmonary hypertension with evidence of severe MR
COMMENTS: 1. Right heart catheterization revealed severely
elevated
pressures throughout the heart. The mean RA was 17 mm HG. The PA
pressure was 92/38 with a mean of about 61mm HG. There was no
pulmonic
valve gradient. The mean wedge pressure was about 40 mm HG. The
cardiac index was diminished at 1.9 liters/min/m2. There were
[**Doctor Last Name **] V
waves in the PCWP tracing consistent with severe MR.
2. There was no significant change in mean PA pressure with 100%
oxygen or nitric oxide. The mean PA was 61 mm HG at baseline,
63mm HG with oxygen, and 60mm HG with nitric oxide. The PCWP was
similarly unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo Male with severe MR, ESRD on HD awaiting kidney
transplant, DMII, HTN admitted for RHC with nitrous oxide who
failed NO vasodilation response.
.
1. Severe MR/pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension was
deemed likely secondary to sever MR as right heart
catheterization showed elevated PAP with no response to NO.
Patient underwent hemodialysis during admission with some
decrease in PAP. At discharge PAP 49/13. He will follow up in
the near future for mitral valve replacement.
.
2. DMII: Fingersticks were monitored closely. His Avandia was
held in the setting of heart failure and hi NPH was titrated. He
was continued on Glucotrol and NPH at discharge.
.
3. HTN: Blood pressor well controlled on Lopressor and Mavik.
.
4. ESRD on HD: Patient underwent daily HD with the goal of
decreasing PAP. He was continued on his regular HD regimen
including Renagel, Epogen, and Zemplar. After his planned mitral
valve repair, he will have a kidney transplant.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Pulmonary artery hypertension
Severe MR
ESRD on dialysis
Hypertension
Diabetes


Discharge Condition:
no chest pain, hemodynamically stable


Discharge Instructions:
If you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
nausea or any other concerning symptoms call your doctor or go
to the emregency room.

The following changes have been made to you medications:
1. Stop taking your avandia as your blood sugar has been low and
it it is not the best medication for you considering your heart

before breakfast and before supper instead of 10 units. Follow
you blood sugars closely and dose as necessary. You should call
you doctor if your sugars are persistently low or high.

3. You are now on metoprolol 25 mg twice daily in addition to

up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to alter your blood pressure medications as
needed.


Followup Instructions:
