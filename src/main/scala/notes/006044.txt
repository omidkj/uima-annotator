Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Echocardigram
MRI/CT

History of Present Illness:
53M h/o atrial fibrillation, here after polymorphic VT arrest.
USOH until today when he received a flu shot, reportedly had
some seizure type activity (shaking and incontinence), then was
witnessed to slump over during a meeting in the morning.
Received bystander CPR at OSH X 2-3min, then was found to be in
VT by EMS (appears polymorphic).  Shock 200J X 1, CPR, continued
?VT, shock 200J X 1, CPR, continued ?VT, shock 300J X1, CPR->
asystole.
- Epi X 1, atropine X 1, CPR
- ?AF w/ PVCs.
- Intubated in field
- On arrival to OSH, pt was noted to be in Atrial fibrillation,
190-200s per report, SBP110s (?NRB at the time).
- Unclear why, but reintubated on etomidate, vecuronium (?mental
status unresponsive)
- Underwent echo (RV/LV dysfunction, HK)
- ?Repeat seizure activity, responded to 2mg Ativan-> CT head ->
neg for bleed
- Went into rapid AF w/ drop of SBP to 80s, given metoprolol IV
2.5 X 2, then started on esmolol drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care.
- Labs at OSH: WBC 5.7, Hct 41.2, Plt 255, Na 141, K 4.4, Cl
111, Bicarb 18, BUN 16, Cr 1.0, Gluc 204, Ca 8.1, Mg 1.9(?),
Trop I 0.018, Myo 474, ast 124 alt 108.
En route to [**Hospital1 18**], given fentanyl bolus for agitation.  On
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], was on esmolol drip w/ SBP 70s.  Esmolol drip
discontinued with immediate restoration of SBP to 90s->110s.  At
this point ABG: 7.27/43/402/21 on AC 650 X 16 Peep 5 100% FiO2.
Pupils pinpoint, no eyelash reflex, but bilateral LE withdrawing
to pain, L babinski up, R no response.
About 30 min into hospitalization, pt noted again to have tonic
posturing (upper extremities curled, lower extremities
straightened), grimacing, no longer responding to pain, rhythmic
contraction of abdominal muscles.  Thought to be seizing, which
responded to Ativan 4mg bolus (initially no response to first
2mg).  Started on versed drip @ 1mg following immediate bolus.
A stat echo revealed EF 15%, global HK.  Given polymorphic VT
and EF, pt taken to cath lab emergently, revealing clean
coronary arteries: RHC CI 2.2, CO 4.x. RA 12, RV 30, PA ?45,
PCWP 30.
Wife denies any recent cold medication use, any recent
illnesses, syncope, presyncope.  States was able to walk about
one block, but had some dyspnea at the end of a block.  No chest
pain or SOB at baseline.  No previous seizure activity.
Otherwise, negative review of systems, no allergic medications.

.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Numerous paraspinal and
suprascapular collaterals are demonstrated on the right. There
is an endotracheal tube that terminates above the carina. There
is a Swan-Ganz catheter that enters via the inferior vena cava
and terminates in a right upper lobe pulmonary arterial branch.
The evaluation is nondiagnostic for pulmonary embolism. The
aorta and great vessels are grossly patent. There is an apparent
metallic density in the descending thoracic aorta that
terminates approximately 5.5 cm distal to the takeoff of the
left subclavian artery that presumably represents an intraaortic
balloon pump. There are bilateral pleural effusions and
associated compressive atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The aorta is obscured by
artifact and that presumably represents an intraaortic balloon
pump. There is a Swan-Ganz catheter in the inferior vena cava
that enters via the right groin. Limited evaluation of the
liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen is unremarkable. The
adrenal glands are grossly unremarkable. There are several
hypodense areas that project in the renal collecting systems
that may represent excreted contrast. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis. Small and large bowel are grossly unremarkable.
There is no intra-abdominal free fluid or free air.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A catheter is present within
the bladder. Air within the bladder is presumably secondary to
Foley catheterization. There are scattered sigmoid diverticula
without evidence of diverticulitis. No pelvic free fluid.
