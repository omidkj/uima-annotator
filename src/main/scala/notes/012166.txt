Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yoF russian speaking only with history of HTN, HL, TIA who
was in her USOH until 4 days ago when she started having
subjective fever, non-prodcutive cough, headache, runny nose.
She was seen by PCP on tuesday and prescribed Z-Pac for
bronchitis.  After being started on Z-pack patient had episodes
of nausea, NB/NB vomting episodes. No appetite.  No abdominal
pain or diarrhea.  VNA visited patient today noted to have O2
sats in mid 80s on RA and convinced patient to go to the ED.  In
the ED she was noted to be hypoxic to 80s also complained of
chest pressure which was non-exertional.   Vitals were T:98.4F,
HR:74, BP:122/55, RR:16, O2:98% on 4L NC.  CXR was notable for
likely R sided PNA, and signs of volume overload with bilateral
pleural effusions and vascular congestion. Labs were notable for
a WBC of 16.8, stable renal dysfunction with a Cr of 1.3, a
proBNP of 10K, and a Tn-T of 0.13. She continued to have low O2
sats therefore she was started on BIPAP but swiched back when
her sats came back to normal. She was given aspirin, IV heparin,
nitroglycerin for possible NSTAMI.  She was also started on
ceftirzone and azithromycin for PNA. She was seen by our
cardiology service and found to have volume overloaded and
pneumonia.  She was determined not to have NSEMI based on her
EKG. She was given 20mg IV lasix in the prior to being admitted
to CCU for further monitoring.
.
Currently in the CCU patient complains fo headaches but denies
any chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, chills,
night sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea.  She does not use any
nebs at home and denies any any prior history of CHF.  No recent
weight changes.

CXR: [**2199-8-15**]
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 The heart size appears normal.  Pulmonary vascular markings are
indistinct and prominent in the upper lobes, compatible with
mild pulmonary edema.  Peripheral wedge shaped right upper lobe
opacity is similar to prior.  Right hilar and middle lobe patchy
consolidative opacities are new.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions are present.  No pneumothorax.  No radiopaque foreign
body.  Osseous structures are unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural
effusions and new right hilar and middle lobe consolidative
opacities, suggestive of pneumonia.  Follow-up radiographs are
recommended.
.
CXR: [**2199-8-16**]
FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate a
decrease in the bilateral reticular interstitial markings of the
lungs.  There has also been interval increase in bilateral
pleural effusions.  These findings suggest a resolving pulmonary
edema.  There has also been interval increase in the density of
the previously seen right hilar, right lower zone, and right
upper zone opacities.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged.
.
IMPRESSION:  Resolving pulmonary edema.  Increasing density of
right lung opacities suggest progressing pneumonia.
.
CXR: [**2199-8-18**]
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Right perihilar
consolidation is less conspicuous than before.  This is due to
difference in positioning of the patient and re-distribution of
the moderate right pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.
Right middle lobe and right lower lobe pneumonic consolidations
are unchanged.  Right upper lobe wedge-shape opacity is more
chronic.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion
is unchanged. Mild interstitial edema has improved.
.
TTE: [**2199-8-16**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45
%) secondary to hyokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There
is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent
fat pad.
