HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2118-12-12**].  He had preoperative
evaluation for coronary artery bypass  surgery.

On [**2118-12-13**] the patient was brought to the operating room by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and had a coronary artery bypass graft times
four.  He had left internal mammary artery anastomosed to his
LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM1, saphenous vein graft D1,
and radial artery to posterior descending artery.  Please see
previously dictated operative note for more details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the Intensive Care Unit on Nitroglycerin and Propofol drips.

The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course.
Postoperative day #1 he was still on Neo-Synephrine and Nitro
drips which were weaned off during the course of
postoperative day #1.  On postoperative day #1 his chest
tubes were both removed and he was extubated.  On
postoperative day #2 the patient was transferred to the
patient care floor without incident.  Foley was removed and
began ambulating.  By postoperative day #3 he was ambulating,
tolerating a diet, was able to void on his own without a
Foley catheter and his pain was reasonably controlled with
Dilaudid with oral Dilaudid.

Postoperative course was complicated only by increasing cough
with thick green colored sputum.  Chest x-ray revealed a left
lower lobe density possibly consistent with an infiltrate.
Because of the purulent sputum and chest x-ray, the patient
was presumed to have a pneumonia and was started on Levaquin
on [**12-16**].  The patient will remain on Levaquin for total of 10
days.  The patient never had an increase in his white blood
count and had been afebrile throughout the hospital course.

Does not have family at home to support him and his
ambulation still is not quite at the level we feel
comfortable sending home.  For these reasons he will be
discharged to rehab on [**2118-12-17**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged to rehab.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol MDI 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **], Imdur 30
mg po q day, Glyburide 10 mg po bid, Lopressor 25 mg po bid,
Celexa 20 mg po q day and that will run after [**12-19**], Celexa
10 mg po q day and that is going to be effective from
discharge until [**12-19**], Levaquin 250 mg po q day, stop date
[**2118-12-26**], Lasix 20 mg po bid times one week, KCL 20 mEq po
bid while on Lasix, Colace 100 mg po bid, Aspirin 81 mg po q
day, Dilaudid 2-6 mg po q 4 hours prn pain.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in [**4-10**]
weeks.  The patient will follow-up with his primary care
physician in three weeks.
