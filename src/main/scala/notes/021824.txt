Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**]
Chief Complaint:
Difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tracheal intubation
chest tube placement
central line placement


History of Present Illness:
85 y/o M with history of C-spine trauma and surgery, and chronic
dysphagia, presents with worsening dysphagia and respiratory
distress.  Per patient's wife, he had tooth extraction [**1-19**]
cavity ~6 weeks ago.  Experienced sore throat and increasing
difficulty swallowing x 3 weeks, more with liquids than solids.
GI procedure endoscopy 9 days ago showed presbyopic esphogus.
2-3 days ago, patient began having "gargling sounds," and over
the last 24 hours, with worsening breathing, so called EMS. Per
EMS he was satting well.  Denies fever or chills. He has had an
intermittent cough productive of some phlegm that has been
persistent for a week that was found on review of systems. No
chest pain pain back neck arm or jaw.

Of note, 10-years ago, had similar episode with respiratory
distress, attributed to anaphylaxis [**1-19**] erythromycin.

In the ED, found to have stridor, and desaturation with laying
back.  Saw significant upperairway edema, so patient intubated.
SBP in 60s in setting of propofol and positive pressure, so
sedation switched to fentanyl and versed.  Given Levoflox,
vancomycin, and clinda for concern of infection.  Raecemic epi
neb and 7mg IV decadron for concern for anaphylaxis.  RIJ
placed.  CT neck showed retropharyngeal area of edema without
fluid collection.  ENT consulted.  Given 5L NS.  CVP 8, 102.4
PR, 60, 14, 89/50, 100% on vent on transfer to MICU.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or
urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin
changes.

IMAGING:
CT neck [**2157-11-25**]:
1. Extensive prevertebral/retropharyngeal soft tissue density
from C2-3 through C7-T1, which could reflect edema and phlegmon
in the setting of infection, though an infiltrative soft tissue
mass/neoplasm cannot be excluded by imaging. Additional
obscuration of normal fat planes is seen in the parapharyngeal
and carotid spaces. No focal rim-enhancing fluid collection. An
MRI with contrast is recommended for further evaluation of this
abnormality.
2. Healed fracture deformity at C7-T1 with residual
anterolisthesis.
3. Layering non-hemorrhagic right pleural effusion.
4. Nonspecific 4-mm ground-glass nodules at the lung apices,
with incompletely visualized consolidation laterally in the left
upper lung, which could reflect aspiration or pneumonia.

CXR [**2157-11-25**]:
IMPRESSION: New bibasilar opacities, which given the clinical
history are suspicious for aspiration, possibly developing
pneumonia.

CT Neck/Chest w contrast [**2157-11-27**]:
1. Probable hyperemic swelling, upper airway does not extend
more than 2 cm inferior to the vocal cords. Tracheal mucosa
distally is normal. This
finding should be interpreted in conjunction with the separate
report of the neck CT scans performed on [**11-27**] and
[**11-25**].
2. The most substantial pulmonary abnormality is the collapse of
more than
half of the left lower lobe, with no bronchial obstruction.
Small bilateral pleural and pericardial effusions are presumably
interrelated, but none has a substantial respiratory or
hemodynamic effect.
3. Small region of consolidation in right middle lobe, could be
contusion
from chest tube insertion.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic coronary calcification.
