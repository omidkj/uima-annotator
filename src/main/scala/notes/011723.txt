History of Present Illness:
20 year old male who complains of S/P
FALL. The patient was seen upon arrival. This is called as a
trauma stat. The patient reportedly fell 20 feet onto his
head. He is in obvious scalp laceration in the field. There
were attempts at intubation. His GCS was initially 3. He
then woke up and became more combative. The paramedics were
unable to take a blood pressure because he was combative.

PMH: schizophreniform d/o
PSH: none
[**Last Name (un) 1724**]: none

Social History:
lives with his mother, was attending BU on an
acting scholarship when he first developed psychoses. He has had
some legal issues, on probation for acting bizarrely and
resisting arrest.

Substance use history: mother reports heavy THC use in the past
and occasional alcohol abuse as well.

IMAGING:
[**11-6**] CXR: mediastinal double density(? paraspinal hematoma);
right sided rib fractures
[**11-6**] CT HEAD: WETREAD - Left SDH along left cerebral convexity
with 6mm rightward shift from midline. small right temporal
parenchymal contusion. bilateral occipital subgaleal hematomas.
occipital skull fracture. left occipital condyle fracture.
[**11-6**] CT C-SPINE: WETREAD - left occipital condyle fracture.
rest of C-spine intact. mediastinal hematoma better assessed on
CT Chest. Intubated.
[**11-6**] CT TORSO: WETREAD - Extensive posterior mediastinal
hematoma, likely from disruption of intercostal vessels, with
two small areas of active extravasation. Aorta and major blood
vessels intact without pseudoaneurysm. Multiple posterior right
rib fractures with anterior displacement of ribs [**6-25**]. Multiple
pulmonary contusions and lacerations. Right transverse process
fractures of L1-L4.
[**11-6**] Angio: T9 parenchymal blush -> 12 coils, T10 -> 6mm plug,
T11 transected pseudoaneurysm -> 6 coils
[**11-7**] CT HEAD: WETREAD - interval increase in intra- and
extra-axial hemorrhage
[**11-7**]:TTE:The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small pericardial effusion.
[**11-8**]: HCT: Minimal change from the previous study with
redemonstrated
extensive, multifocal intra- and extra-axial hemorrhage and
cerebral edema, in pattern suggestive of both contusions and
[**Doctor First Name **], without evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.
[**11-10**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the position
of the endotracheal tube is unchanged. The tip is located
projecting 2.1 cm above the carina. This is relatively low, the
tube could be pulled back by approximately 1 cm. Unchanged
course of the nasogastric tube and of the left subclavian access
line. Minimal decrease in extent of the pre-existing large left
pleural effusion, mild increase in extent of the pre-existing
moderate-to-large right pleural
effusion, with increasing atelectatic consolidation of the right
lower lung. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. No
detectable additional parenchymal abnormality.
[**11-10**] HCT: pending
[**11-11**] CXR: The ET tube tip is low, 2 cm above the carina. The
left subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC. The NG tube
tip is in the stomach. There is no change in pulmonary edema,
bilateral pleural effusions, although minimal improvement of the
right base aeration is noted as well as status post embolization
of right posterior intercostal arteries.
[**11-12**] CXR: b/l large pleural effusions unchanged. bibasilar
opacities. mild pulmonary edema. overall no significant changes.
[**11-14**]: CXR: Worsening moderate pleural effusions. Bibasilar
atelectasis, worsened on the left. New right mid lung
atelectasis, less likely consolidation.
[**11-16**]: CXR - white out RML and RLL
[**11-17**]: CXR-Improved aeration of right middle lobe. Persistent
bilateral pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis.
[**11-18**]: CXR: Right hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen. This may
merely reflect the semi-upright rather than supine portable
technique. The appearance is consistent with pleural fluid and
volume loss at the right base. Retrocardiac opacification with
blunting of the left costophrenic angle is again consistent with
volume loss and effusion. Left chest tube remains in place and
there is no definite pneumothorax.
[**11-19**]: CXR - small left pneumothorax (after L CT to waterseal)
[**11-21**]: CXR: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
there is little change in the moderate pneumothorax on the left.
Opacification in the retrocardiac area is consistent with a
substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe and small
effusion. A moderate right layering effusion is again seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient evaluated in ED, trauma survey revealed the following
injuries:
post R rib fx with ant displacement
mult pulm contusions and lacs
Right tp fractures of L1-L4
posterior mediastinal hematoma
occipital skull fx
L occipital condyle fx
B/L subgaleal hematomas
R temporal parenchymal contusion
L SDH w/ assoc'd 6mm rightward shift

He was admitted tot he trauma ICU
ICU Course:
[**11-6**]: admission to TSICU. to IR for coil embolization of
bleeding intercostal vessels. post-IR head CT showed worsening
intra- and extra-axial hemorrhage. post-IR, hct and lactate
improving.
[**11-7**]: left subclavian TL placed, TF started
[**11-8**]:repeat HCT showed minimal change, kept on mannitol. When
switched to CPAP, his ICP increased and he became bradycardic.
As a result, he was kept on the ventilator and minimal sedation.
[**11-9**]: able to wean to CPAP without elevation in ICP, subsequent
ABGs looked good. bronch performed to evaluate persistent
hemoptysis. only hyperemia and small amount of clot seen.
[**11-10**]: TF increased to 80ml/h since propofol gtt decreased
[**11-11**]: extubated, bronch'd, had to be reintubated. aline resited
to L radius. spiked fever
