Admission Date:  [**2161-3-1**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-3-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2099-8-6**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 61-year-old
Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2153**] and
myocardial infarction in [**2152**] and [**2160**], who is being admitted
for sudden onset of chest pain.  The patient was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2161-2-11**] for treatment of
bilateral gangrenous feet.  There was a plan for bilateral
below the knee amputations.  However, the patient had
intermittent ventricular tachycardia during the
hospitalization and was started on amiodarone.  The patient
was planned for cardiac catheterization prior to going
bilateral below the knee amputations and during the
catheterization, the patient had an acute ST elevation
myocardial infarction.  The patient was treated with medical
management.

He was transferred to the CCU, where he continued to have
recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia.  The patient
continued to be medically managed and was discharged to
[**Hospital **] Rehab.  The patient is coming back on this current
admission two days after the last discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehab
with sudden onset of chest pain described as identical to his
anginal equivalent.  The pain was brought on at rest and was
associated with shortness of breath and radiation to the
shoulder blades.  There was no improvement with two
sublingual nitroglycerins and the patient's blood pressure
dropped into the 80s systolic.

The patient continued to complain of pain in the epigastric
region and described it as a squeezing sensation.  He also
complained of nausea and vomiting for several days prior to
admission.  He denies any palpitations, lightheadedness, or
other symptoms.

VITAL SIGNS ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.8, blood pressure
88/34, pulse 82, respiratory rate 16.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  The patient is obese, lying in bed in no
apparent distress.  Skin examination shows multiple scabs
with dry gangrene of bilateral feet especially of the right
lower extremity.  Oropharynx is clear with no obvious JVD and
moist mucous membranes.  Heart examination shows a normal S1,
S2 with a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs
appreciated, but distant heart sounds.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities
showed trace edema of the bilateral lower extremities and
trace to 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurologic
examination is grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 10, hematocrit 34.1,
platelets 135.  INR 1.4.  Chemistries is significant for a
chloride of 93, bicarb of 30, BUN of 34, and creatinine of
5.2.  Initial CK was 40.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of CHF or pneumonia.

EKG shows low voltage with normal sinus rhythm at 80 beats
per minute.  Axis is normal.  QRS is mildly prolonged.  There
are old ST depressions in leads V2 through V4.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE:
1. Coronary artery disease:  The patient has flat CKs and
elevated troponins, however, due to the fact that he had
failed revascularization on a previous cardiac
catheterization, there is no plan for recatheterization.  It
is also likely that the elevated troponins were secondary to
the patient's elevated secondary to the patient's end-stage
renal disease rather than representing an acute event.  The
patient was managed medically.  His regimen was changed so
that beta-blocker was added.  Carvedilol was started at a low
dose.  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix, and statin.

The patient's beta-blocker dose is not able to be titrated up
due to borderline blood pressure.  However, he did not have
any further significant chest pain, although he did complain
of occasional epigastric burning, which was not clearly
anginal.  The patient was continued on current medical
management.  There is no option for interventional procedure.

2. Congestive heart failure and fluid overload:  On
admission, the patient was found to be approximately 15 to 20
kg above his dry weight.  Renal service was consulted for
hemodialysis, and the patient underwent two hemodialysis
sessions.  However, they were not able to remove significant
amounts of fluid due to the fact that there was concern for
ventricular arrhythmia and hypotension during dialysis.  At
that point, the patient was transferred to the CCU for a CVVH
and removal of fluid through CVVH.

The patient received several days of CVVH with effective
fluid removal, however, he subsequently had a 22 beat run of
ventricular tachycardia.  At this point, a CVVH was stopped.
The patient did not appear to be significantly fluid
overloaded after that point as he continued to receive
hemodialysis.  His oxygenation was very good, and he did not
have any other signs of heart failure.

3. Rhythm:  Patient continued to have significant ventricular
ectopy with intermittent runs of nonsustained polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia.  As this was thought to be due to
his underlying ischemic heart disease, there is no
intervention that can be performed by Electrophysiology
service that would be effective.  The patient was continued
on amiodarone and mexiletine.  His mexiletine dose was
increased to 250 mg b.i.d, though he continued to have
intermittent short runs of NSVT.

4. End-stage renal disease:  As previously mentioned, the
patient had a CVVH to decrease his weight to his goal weight
120 kg.  However, this was stopped to ventricular arrhythmia.
The patient then underwent hemodialysis first with no fluid
removal, which he tolerated well and subsequently with fluid
removal of 1.6 liters on the second day, again which he
tolerated well without significant episodes of hypotension or
arrhythmia.  The patient's CVVH catheter was removed by
Interventional Radiology.

5. Peripheral vascular disease:  Patient was seen by Vascular
Surgery as he was awaiting bilateral knee amputations for his
dry gangrene of both feet.  Due to his cardiac situation,
this was not undertaken during the hospitalization.  Patient
is to followup with his vascular surgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] after
discharge to be reassessed for possible surgery for the dry
gangrene.

6. Diabetes mellitus:  The patient's diabetes was managed per his
outpatient regimen with insulin glargine, and Humalog sliding
scale.

7. Code status:  The patient was full code on admission.
However, after discussion with him and his family, he was
made DNI only, but he did want to be resuscitated.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to a
[**Hospital 3058**] rehab facility.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient was in good condition.  He is
afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and tolerating p.o.
