History of Present Illness:
For details please reveiw [**Hospital1 **] B admission note, 83yo M with
complicated PMH and recent MICU admission for MRSA sepsis
presents from Rehab (NBOTC) with fever, diarrhea, vomiting and
dehydration.
.
Of note, the patient has had multiple hospitalizations in the
last few months. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 7145**] on [**2112-6-17**] after
sustaining a fall at home and had a R THR that was complicated
by blood loss requiring transfusion of 6 units PRBCs, AFib,
NSTEMI, and pneumonia during a 10 day hospitalization [**Date Range 7145**]. He
received IV antibiotics while inpatient. On [**6-28**], he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 55**], given oxycodone for pain and
lasix for volume overload, becoming increasingly lethargic and
sustained another fall on [**7-14**].
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-7-17**] very dehydrated, received 5L
NS in the ED (T102, BP90/49, HR103, O293%RA), and was found to
develop MRSA sepsis. He was intubated and on pressors in the
MICU. He was covered broadly with Vanco, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin
and narrowed to Vancomycin when he grew MRSA in [**7-18**] bottles.
Source of MRSA was never discovered, and R hip aspiration showed
no growth on culture. LLE MRI was negative for osteomyelitis.
CTA showed AAA graft in good position. His course at [**Hospital1 18**] was
complicated by hyponatremia, anemia, AF with RVR, and demand
ischemia/NSTEMI (2nd MI within the month). TEE could not be
performed and PICC was placed for planned 6 week course of
vancomycin for empiric treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Discharged
on [**7-26**] to [**Hospital 19168**] Rehab.
.
His course in rehab between [**Date range (1) 97685**] was complicated by
continued delirium. He was transfused 2 units PRBCs on [**8-2**].  On
[**8-3**], he developed clear/yellow, large volume, foul smelling
liquid stools every hour concerning for C. Diff. Studies were
sent and he was empirically started on PO Flagyl on [**8-6**].  He
also developed copious NBNB emesis starting on the evening of
[**8-6**] and was febrile to 101.4.  In this setting, he had was
noted to be increasingly confused, pulling at clothes and his
PICC etc. Upon questioning, the pt. endorses fever but denies
chills. The decision was made to bring the patient to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED. Patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, diarrhea this morning.  Admission to the Medicine service
was notable for a WBC bandemia of 16%.
.
On the night of [**2112-8-8**], Medicine [**Hospital1 **] team signout was
concerned about EKG changes (STE in III and AVF with reciprocal
depression in I and AVL felt to be underlying artifacts given
his lack of CP - per cardiology).  Besides intermittent
hypotension his SaO2 has been fine, he has been getting repeated
boluses and nebs.  In review, his BP on arrival ([**8-7**]) was
120-130's mmHg systolic, HR in the 80-90s.  On [**8-8**], his sBP is
now at 80-90's mmHg, HR in the 110's.  He recieved multiple
fluid boluses.  Throughout this process, RR was in mid-teens and
satting well on room air.

Then at 4:30 am on [**8-8**], he became tachypenic, ronchorous, gave
20mg of IV lasix, CXR revealed new onset R>L fluffy infiltrates.
 Suctioning was performed, with return of brown food particles
(raising concern for aspiration).  He did not tolerate neb
treatment and no response to 20mg IV lasix, and then 40mg IV
lasix.  Attempted but failed ABG.  Given hypotension, marked
tachypnea, and hypoxia (presumed as not able to get pleth), pt
was intubated.  Peri-intubation he was hypotensive down to 50/30
mmHg, received fluids via PICC.  He was started on dopamine
initially but did not respond, then he was switched to levophed.

.
ROS: unable to review as patient was intubated.
