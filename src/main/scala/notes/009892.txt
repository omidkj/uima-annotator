Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 81 year old
gentleman who had a past medical history significant for
hypertension, chronic anemia, chronic renal insufficiency and
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.  He recently
developed increasing shortness of breath and fatigue.
Echocardiogram showed moderate to significant aortic
stenosis.  He was referred in for cardiac catheterization in
preparation for aortic valve replacement.

Cardiac catheterization showed that he had moderate aortic
stenosis and moderate coronary artery disease.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Chronic anemia.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
4.  Renal calculi ten years ago.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lisinopril 30 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Terazosin 2 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:   He was allergic to intravenous dye which causes
skin rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He had no tobacco history and social
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission he was in sinus rhythm
with a blood pressure of 140/80.  His skin was clear.  His
neck was supple with no jugular venous distention.  He had
two plus palpable carotid pulses with no bruits, no
lymphadenopathy.  His heart has a regular rate and rhythm
with a normal S1 and S2 and a Grade III/VI systolic ejection
murmur.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, and obese with no
hepatosplenomegaly or other palpable masses.  Extremities
were warm and well perfused with pedal edema and no
varicosities.  His neurological examination showed he was
alert and oriented times three, with gross motor and sensory
intact and two plus palpable radial, femoral, dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  On admission, of note his creatinine was 1.4.
His EKG showed normal sinus rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was admitted to the Operating Room
where he underwent aortic valve replacement with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with a 21 millimeter bovine pericardial valve and a
coronary artery bypass graft times one.  Please refer to the
operative note.

He tolerated surgery well and without complication and was
transferred to Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on a
Nitroglycerin drip at 0.5 mics per kilo per minute for blood
pressure control and a propofol drip.  He was extubated later
that evening without incident.

On postoperative day one he was weaned off all drips. He had
a heart rate of 75 in normal sinus.  He had a couple of short
limited episodes of ectopy with some PACs while in sinus
tachycardia and one brief self-resolving run of ventricular
tachycardia.  He remained, however, mainly in sinus rhythm
with a heart rate of between 70 and 80.  Chest tubes were
removed on postoperative day three and he was started on
Lopressor for pressure and heart rate control.  He
additionally required intravenous Hydralazine for further
blood pressure control.

On postoperative day four, he was deemed stable and ready for
transfer to the regular floor.  On postoperative day five, he
went into persistent atrial flutter which soon began to
alternate with atrial fibrillation.  His rate was
persistently in the 120 to 130 range.  He was given
intravenous Lopresor and intravenous amiodarone.  His rate
was eventually able to be controlled between 85 and 95 on 100
mg twice a day of oral Lopressor and 400 mg three times a day
of oral amiodarone.

He remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic
throughout the period.  Despite all the medication he did not
convert into sinus rhythm and was started on low dose of
intravenous heparin.  Once therapeutic on this heparin the
decision was made to cardiovert the patient as it was felt
that due to his age he would not be an ideal candidate for
Coumadin.  He was then successfully cardioverted on
postoperative day seven and has remained in normal sinus
rhythm since that time with the heart rate in the 70s.

Following overnight observation on Telemetry after his
cardioversion, he was deemed ready and stable for transfer to
the extended care facility.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. twice a day times seven days, then
400 mg q. day times one month.
2.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Percocet one tablet p.o. p.r.n. q. four to six hours for
pain.
6.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Atorvastatin 40 gm p.o. q. day.
9.  Terazosin hydrochloride 2 mg p.o. q. h.s.
10. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q. day.
11. Ferrous gluconate 300 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Ascorbic acid 500 mg p.o. twice a day.
13. Lopresor 100 mg p.o. twice a day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery
bypass graft times one.
2.  Moderate aortic stenosis.
3.  Chronic anemia.
4.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Renal calculi.

DISPOSITION:   He was discharged to an extended care facility
on a cardiac heart healthy diet with 1800 calorie American
Diabetic Association limit with activity as tolerated.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  He was instructed to follow-up with his cardiologist in
the next one to two weeks.
2.  He was instructed to follow-up with his primary care
physician in one to two weeks.
