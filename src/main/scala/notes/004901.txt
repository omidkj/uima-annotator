Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
CODE STROKE


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TPA administration
Cerebral Angiography with balloon angioplasty
Central Line placement
PICC line placement
Intubation
OG tube
NG tube

History of Present Illness:
19 yo woman with hx migraines only, nonsmoker, no ocps,
presents as code stroke after being found down at 10AM not
moving
left side, somnolent, last known well 9:15, taken to [**Hospital1 18**] and
CT
with no bleed, glucose and INR "normal" now s/p TPA for superior
R MCA stroke with ?clot proximal/M1.  Following TPA, she had
mild
improvement of motor exam, which is as follows upon transfer to
ICU: slight dysarthria, sleepiness, not saying more than several
words at a time, no blink to threat on left, forced right gaze
preference (starting to improve towards midline better), normal
brainstem reflexes, left facial droop, low tone on left, left
delt minimally antigravity, 4- at [**Hospital1 **], 3 at triceps, left IP
antigravity x 3-4 seconds before dropping (better than
admission)
and UMN weakness, brisk reflexes on the left, upgoing toe on the
left, subjective sensory loss on left.  Repeat cta following
administration of IV tpa showed no recannulization of the MCA,
but also no bleed.  I saw the patient at 2:30PM prior to
intubation, and her exam is listed below.  She was taken
emergently to interventional radiology for angiography and
potential consideration of IA TPA; her family was notified and
consented prior to this experimental procedure.  They were
informed of the risks associated with both the angiography and
the combination of IV then IA tpa, and the family wished to
proceed with the procedure.  At just under the 6 hour mark, she
underwent angiography with mechanical intervention with balloon
to open the MCA; revascularization was obtained with balloon
alone, and IA TPA was not given both because of the time
restraints (at this point >6hrs) and risk associated.

Of note, the patient had apparently complained of leg pain
several months back, but more details about this are unknown at
this time.  She was awake at presentation and had denied smoking
or ocps, as well as other medical conditions, medications or
allergies.


Past Medical History:
migraines


Social History:
she is a student (and employee) at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1663**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1688**].  She

Family history later clarified upon family's arrival to US: no
blood clotting disorders, miscarriages, autoimmune disorders, or
early strokes or heart attacks.
