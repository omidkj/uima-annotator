Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, mechanical ventilation


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo Spanish speaking only male with COPD on advair at home, 60
pack year smoking history, and CAD presenting from home on [**2-11**]
with 1 day of "chest congestion," cough, fever, chills, sweats.
Symptoms started with dry cough on evening prior to admission
then subsequently progressed to include shaking chills, fever,
malaise, and progressive SOB. Denies sick contacts with similar
symptoms, recent nausea, comiting, diarrhea, chest pain,
palpitations. Per family, he received flu shot and they are
unsure if he is up to date on pneumovax. He was last
hospitalized 3-4 years ago with similar symptoms at [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital but he had never been intubated.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 100.0 80 140/65 18 89% on RA and 99% NRB.
CXR revealed left lingular PNA. Labs were significant for
lactate 2.1, WBC 11.8 with 90% neutrophils, and Cr 1.7 from
baseline 1.4 in [**2188**]. He received Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin,
levofloxacin, Aspirin 325mg and tylenol. He remained tachypneic
with RR 30s and it was difficult to maintain sats>90-93% even on
NRB. He was thus intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure
and transferred to the MICU.

Past Medical History:
1. Labeled Asthma/COPD but PFTs normal in [**2188**] (Spirometry [**2188**]
shows FEV1 and vital capacity 1.9 and 2.4 (103 and 83% of
predicted respectively). FEV1/FVC ratio is 124% of predicted.
2. CAD s/p MI [**10**] years ago s/p angioplasty
3. s/p pacer inserted 15 years ago for syncope, followed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 951**] at [**Hospital6 1708**].
4. Diverticulitis
5. Remote history of gout
6. Mild chronic renal insufficiency, baseline Cr 1.4 in [**2188**]
7. h/o elevated PSA
8. h/o urinary retention
9. h/o Aspergillus in sputum but normal IgE and no evidence of
bronchiectasis on chest CT [**2188**]
10. Hyperlipidemia
11. GERD
12. HTN


Social History:
Lives with his wife of 60 years, does all of his own ADLs but
wife does cooking at home. He has three grown children, and is a
retired cafeteria worker.  60 pack year smoking history (1-2ppd
x 40 years), quit 20 years ago. He has no history of significant
asbestos exposure.

.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal basal
inferolateral akinesis and inferior hypokinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 45-50%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No intracardiac shunting seen. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2196-2-15**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm with a ventricular premature beat. Modest
inferolateral lead ST-T wave changes are non-specific. Since the
previous tracing of [**2196-2-11**] ventricular ectopy is present.
Otherwise, no significant change
.
Imaging:
.
[**2196-2-16**] CXR:
Mild pulmonary edema is still present. Increase in the extent of
residual consolidation in the left lower lobe could reflect
changes in fluid balance, but should be followed carefully to
exclude recurrent infection. Heart size is normal. There is no
appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
.
CXR [**2-15**]
Pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and right ventricle.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Interval improvement in
interstitial pulmonary edema is seen which is currently mild.
Small bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded but no
appreciable amount of pleural effusion is demonstrated on the
current study. No focal consolidations to suggest infectious
process are seen.
.
CXR [**2-13**]
The relatively symmetric distribution of opacification with a
basal
predominance favors pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia,
unchanged since [**2-12**], worsened since [**2-11**]. Small
right pleural effusion is presumed. Heart is normal size. No
pneumothorax. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads are unchanged in their standard positions,
continuous from the right pectoral pacemaker.
.
CXR [**2-11**]:
Lingular pneumonia. Recommend followup radiographs to document
resolution.
.
CXR [**2-12**]:
Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has worsened, lung volumes are
lower. Bibasilar consolidation is hard to assess but has not
worsened. Small right pleural effusion has developed. ET tube in
standard placement.  Nasogastric tube ends in the region of the
pylorus. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
leads in standard placements.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yo Spanish speaking only male with 60 pack year smoking
history, CAD, presenting with respiratory distess, intubated for
respiratory failure, sputum culturs positive for stre pneumo,
indicating pneumococcal pneumonia.
.
# Pneumonia/Respiratory failure: In the MICU, patient received 2
L NS for hypotension.  He was initially started on tamiflu due
to deterioration and comorbidities; however, this was
discontinued when rapid flu returned negative.    Patient was
extubated successfully on [**2-12**].  Earlier on [**2-13**], sputum cultures
returned + for strep pneumo, thus antibitoics were narrowed to
ceftriaxone only.  Patient was then treansferred to the floor,
bretahing comfortably on 3L, vitals HR 64, 121/59  92-95% 3L,
c/o mild SOB and cough.  He completed an 8 day course of IV
ceftriaxone.
.
#. Pulmonary edema:  In the setting of recieving several liters
of NS and with a mildly depressed E
