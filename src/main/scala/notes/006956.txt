HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
right-handed gentleman seen in consultation for evaluation of
a cystic enhancing mass in the right frontal brain with
neurologic problems beginning in [**2154**] when he experienced
generalized tonic clonic seizure and initially thought it was
from his asthma medication.  Eventually, he had a head CT
which did not show any abnormality.  He was started on
Dilantin and phenobarbital.  He was on Dilantin in [**2157**] but
was still having focal motor seizures with jerks in his left
arm.  He also experienced problems with his thoughts.  He had
loss of consciousness and typically awoke while in an
ambulance.  In [**2167-8-7**], he stopped taking his Dilantin.
In [**Month (only) 1096**], he had generalized tonic clonic seizure again
and later saw a neurologist at [**Hospital 11084**] [**Hospital **] Medical
Center who ordered an MRI.  The MRI showed a mass in the
right posterior frontal brain.  The mass was initially
biopsied by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the pathology was an astrocytoma.
The patient underwent a gross total surgical resection by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2168**] and the pathology changed to low-grade
oligodendroglioma.

After surgery, he was followed by a neurologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8026**], and had an MRI once every six months.  He presents
now with the MRI scan now showing an enhancing multicystic
lesion in the right parietal lobe.  His most recent
generalized tonic clonic seizure was two years ago.  He is
admitted status post a right parietal craniotomy for excision
of this mass.
