Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Status post chest tube removal. Followup.

COMPARISON: [**2168-9-20**], 11:27 a.m.

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, all
monitoring and support
devices have been removed. There only remains an introduction
sheath in the
left internal jugular vein. The size of the cardiac silhouette
is unchanged.
Also unchanged is the extent of a small left-sided pleural
effusion and the
overall normal transparency of the lung parenchyma. There is no
evidence of
overhydration and no evidence of pneumonia.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA. No thrombus
in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Lipomatous
hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. PFO is present.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction. Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve leaflets
with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet motion. Cannot
exclude MS. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Pericardial calcifications.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild inferior . Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. The study is inadequate to exclude
significant mitral valve stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are pericardial calcifications.

Post Bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm on phenylepherine gtt.
Preserved biventricular function, LVEF 50-55%. There is a well
seated bioprosthetic valve insitu. Initial trace MR resolved
over time. No perivalvular leaks. Mean gradient across mitral
prosthesis 5.5-6.5 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 5 lpm. Aortic
Contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeon at the time of the exam.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
