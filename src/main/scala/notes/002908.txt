Admission Date:  [**2138-7-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2138-8-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2065-4-11**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old female
with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, who presented
after approximately four hours of pain, numbness and cold
sensation of her left arm.  She was awakened by this pain and
this precipitated her to seek attention at [**Hospital1 346**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for known coronary artery
disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial
fibrillation, patient was discharged from the hospital two
weeks prior to admission with acute onset of atrial flutter
which was treated at the time with anticoagulation.  She
presented with an acute embolic event to her left arm.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for excision of a cyst on
her left axilla and some skin graft procedure.

MEDICATIONS:  Preoperative medications included insulin,
Atenolol, Coumadin, Lipitor, Zestril and Zantac.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission to the
hospital were as follows.  The patient was afebrile, blood
pressure 220/110, heart rate 144, atrial flutter, respiratory
rate 16 and oxygen saturation of 100%.  She was
neurologically alert and oriented.  She had 5/5 strength on
the right upper extremity and 1-2/5 on the left and also
decreased sensation of the left arm.  She was in atrial
fibrillation by cardiac exam.  Her respiratory exam was
unremarkable.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft, non distended, nontender.
The patient had a left doppler signal in the axillary area
and no arterial flow documented in the brachial, ulnar or
radial arteries.  On the right side the patient had palpable
pulses throughout her right arm.  On her legs, the left
femoral pulse was obtainable by doppler and her right was
palpable and she had doppler signals bilaterally in her
popliteal arteries as well as her feet.

LABORATORY DATA:  Patient's admitting PT was 14, admitting
INR was 1.3.  Other laboratory values on admission were
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] service and was taken to the operating room the
day of admission, [**2138-7-26**] where she underwent a left upper
extremity embolectomy.  The patient also had a right IJ
triple lumen catheter placed for IV access.  Postoperatively
the patient was stable hemodynamically, was heparinized, had
a therapeutic PTT and was noted to have a large hematoma in
the left incision site.  The patient was also placed on a
Diltiazem IV drip due to atrial flutter with rapid
ventricular response.  Cardiology consultation was obtained
later on the day of admission, [**2138-7-26**].  It was their
recommendation to decrease the Diltiazem drip, to place her
on oral Lopressor and to follow-up with transesophageal
echocardiogram.  The patient remained stable from a
hemodynamic standpoint.  Her hematoma showed no signs of
increasing or enlarging and was felt to be stable and not
require any intervention from a vascular surgery standpoint.
Electrophysiology service was consulted regarding the
persistent atrial dysrhythmia.  On postoperative day #2 the
patient was transferred to the cardiology medicine service
since she had no active vascular surgical issues at this
time.  Her history of coronary artery disease and atrial
dysrhythmias were felt to be the predominant problems at this
time.  The patient underwent echocardiogram on [**2138-7-30**] which
revealed a moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast seen
in the body of the left atrium, no mass or thrombus was seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.  The patient
also underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2138-7-30**] which
revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, a
significant three vessel coronary artery disease including a
left main osteal lesion of 80% and also pulmonary
hypertension.  The patient was followed on the medicine
service over the next few days.  Cardiac surgery consult was
obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room on
[**2138-8-4**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] where she underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft times three with a LIMA to the LAD, a
vein to the ramus and a vein to the distal circumflex artery.
Postoperatively she was on Norepinephrine, Epinephrine and
Milrinone IV drip and she was transported from the operating
room to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.  Postoperatively the Norepinephrine was weaned off
the night of surgery.  She was maintained on low dose
Epinephrine drip and the Milrinone was discontinued.  On
postoperative day #1 the patient had improved
hemodynamically, she was weaned down from mechanical
ventilator and extubated on postoperative day #1.  On
postoperative day #2 the patient remained in atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 70-90/minute.  Her
blood pressure stabilized with time.  She was treated with IV
Amiodarone and an attempt at elective synchronous
cardioversion was undertaken and unsuccessful.  The patient
remained in atrial fibrillation over the next couple of days.
In the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on [**2138-8-8**],
postoperative day #4, another attempt at cardioversion was
made after an additional IV Amiodarone bolus.  There were
three attempts made at that time using 300 followed by 360
joules and these attempts were also unsuccessful.  The
patient had been anticoagulated throughout her postoperative
course on IV Heparin drip and Coumadin had been started on
postoperative day #2.  The patient was transferred out of the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #4,
[**2138-8-8**] to the telemetry floor where she was begun with
ambulation and cardiac rehabilitation.  The patient initially
had significant difficulty ambulating.  She had significant
weakness in her right leg with attempts to ambulate.  It was
questioned whether the patient possibly had cerebrovascular
accident, however, she was alert and oriented, she had clear
speech, she had equal hand grasps bilaterally and the weaker
leg which was the right, was her saphenous vein harvest site
leg.

Attempts at ambulation did improve significantly over the
next 48 hours although she still complained of a heavy
feeling in her right foot and right leg.  Today,
postoperative day #7, [**2138-8-11**], the patient is hemodynamically
stable and ready to be discharged to a rehabilitation
facility.  Her exam is as follows: She is alert and oriented,
her pupils are equal and react to light and accommodation.
Her speech is clear.  She still has some right lower
extremity weakness, it is unclear as to the etiology of this.
She has bilateral equal hand grasps which are significantly
strong and does not appear to have any other neurologic
deficits.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation with few
bibasilar crackles, left greater than right.  The patient has
a smoking history.  She has some sputum production which is
clear and scant amount.  Her heart sounds are irregular with
no murmur noted.  Her sternum is stable.  Her Steri-Strips
are clean, dry and intact to her sternal incision.  Her
Steri-Strips to her right leg incisions are also clean, dry
and intact.  Patient's most recent INR values are as follows.
On [**8-9**] her INR was 1.6.  On [**8-10**] her INR is 1.8.  On [**8-11**]
her INR was 3.1.  It was today, on [**8-11**], that her Heparin was
discontinued.  The patient has received 2.5 mg of Coumadin on
[**8-25**], [**8-9**] and [**8-10**]. She is to receive 1 mg of Coumadin
today, [**8-11**] and her INR should be checked daily until she is
on a stable dose of Coumadin with her target INR being 2.5 to
3.0 for her atrial fibrillation and history of embolic
events.
