Service:  GENERAL                   Date: [**2125-5-22**]


Surgeon:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 4174**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 16133**]

DATE OF DISCHARGE:  To be determined.

HISTORY  OF  THE  PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old man
with  history  of  cerebral  palsy,  mild mental retardation,
coronary  artery  disease,  seizure disorder, and small-bowel
obstruction,  who presented from [**Hospital3 **] Center
with diffuse lower abdominal pain with radiation to the back,
fever,  nausea, and vomiting for two days.  The patient first
noted  this pain when his wheelchair struck another one, five
days  prior  to  admission.    He  was  also complaining of a
productive  cough  of yellow-to-brown sputum.  Vital signs in
the  emergency  room  revealed  temperature 100.3, pulse 118,
blood  pressure 91/54, respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation
95%  on  1.5  liters.    The patient was given IV Ampicillin,
Gentamicin,  and  Flagyl  in  the  emergency  room and he was
admitted   to  the  Surgery  Service  initially.    Of  note,
Levofloxacin  500  mg p.o.q.d. had been started at the [**Hospital3 1761**]  on [**5-7**].  Per report, he has a baseline
congested cough.

LABORATORY  DATA:    Admission  labs  are  significant for an
increased  white  blood  cell  count  34.1, ALT 242, AST 122,
alkaline  phosphatase  166,  amylase  [**2049**], lipase 750, total
bilirubin  1.2.    CT  of  the  abdomen  was  consistent with
pancreatitis  with question of organizing collection inferior
to  the  head  of  the  pancreas, mild left intrahepatic duct
dilation.   MRCP was done consistent with acute pancreatitis,
no  filling defects in biliary tree and free fluid in abdomen
and  pelvis.  He was treated with IV fluids, pain medications
sternotomy and bowel rest.  He was started on IV antibiotics.
In  addition, PICC line was placed.  The patient continued to
be  febrile  the  first few days of hospitalization.  TPN was
started  as  he  was  NPO and on [**5-2**] because the LFTs,
amylase, and lipase were all back to normal and the patient's
test  was  resolving,  he  was  transferred  to  the Medicine
Service.  Because his MRCP was inconclusive, ERCP was done on
[**5-11**]  with  the  finding  of  stone  and sludge at the
biliary  tree.   The stone was removed and sphincterotomy was
done.  Common bile duct was dilated to 12-mm.

Abdominal   ultrasound:      The   patient   is  status  post
cholecystectomy,   common  bile  duct  appears  unremarkable,
limited  evaluation  of  the  rest  of  the  abdomen  due  to
overlying gas.

CT   of   the  abdomen  with  contrast  as  well  as  pelvis:
Pancreatitis  with  a probable organizing collection inferior
to  the  head of the pancrease; mild left intrahepatic ductal
dilatation.

MR  of  the  abdomen,  [**5-10**],  [**2125**]:  No MR evidence of
filling  defects  in  the  biliary  tree  and  limited study;
changes consistent with acute pancreatitis; prominent head of
the pancreas; free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis.

Chest  AP, [**5-10**]:  Successful placement of PICC, the tip
of which is in the SVC ready for use.

[**5-12**],  [**2125**],  portable  abdominal  film, dilated small
bowel  loops  and  earlier  partial  small-bowel  obstruction
suspected.

[**5-12**], portal AP:  Slight    elevation   of   the   left
hemidiaphragm with subsegmental atelectasis at the left base,
otherwise, no interval change.

[**5-13**]:   Portal AP:  Worsened fluid status versus prior
increased bibasilar atelectasis.

[**5-13**]:    Portal  AP:   Intraperitoneal free air on the
upright projection.

[**5-14**]:    Portal  AP:  No evidence of pneumonia or CHF,
atelectasis left base unchanged.

[**5-14**]:    CT  with  reconstruction  of  the abdomen and
pelvis;  interval  progressive of peripancreatic inflammatory
changes   less   than   30%   of  the  pancreatic  parenchyma
demonstrating   a  lack  of  contrast  enhancement;  interval
increase  in  size  or  probable  organizing  phlegmon in the
region  of  the inferior pancreatic head;  no drainable fluid
collection;  free  air  within  the  biliary  tree presumably
secondary  to  the  recent  ERCP;  inadequate  assessment  of
previously-described  thickened loops of jejunum secondary to
lack  of  distention  with  oral  contrast; paraumbilical and
right  inguinal  hernias;  small bilateral pleural effusions.
