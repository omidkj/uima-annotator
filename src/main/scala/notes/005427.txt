History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39231**] is a 79 year old woman t-boned during an MVC during
which she lost consciousness. She was initially transferred to
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital where imaging revealed multiple injuries,
including posterior L 6th rib fx, L intertrochanteric fracture,
L ankle fracture, L superior ramus fracture, R tibial plateau
fracture, and R ankle fracture. She became hypotensive while at
[**Hospital3 **] Hospital so was urgently transferred to our institution
for further management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2165-3-26**] CXR: There is a large right pneumothorax with right
upper lobe and
likely right middle lobe collapse. The right hemidiaphragm is
depressed. No mediastinal shift is appreciated. Heart size is
top normal. The left lung is well aerated. A left seventh rib
fracture is seen.

[**2165-3-27**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. There
is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular pressure overload. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

[**2165-3-27**] XR PELVIS: Left femoral intertrochanteric fracture. No
definite pelvic fracture, but if there is clinical concern for
occult fracture, CT could be performed.

[**2165-3-29**] Renal US :
1. No evidence for renal artery stenosis.
2. Multiple parenchymal and parapelvic cysts bilaterally. No
evidence of
hydronephrosis.

[**2165-3-30**] Head CT :
Normal head CT. A small amount of subcutaneous air in the neck
posteriorly

[**2165-4-1**] MRI Head :
No evidence of acute intracranial process. Scattered FLAIR
hyperintensities within the periventricular and subcortical
white matter are present which likely represent the sequela of
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

[**2165-4-6**] Duplex scan B/L lower extremities :
1. Thrombus in the right greater saphenous vein, and
non-occlusive thrombus within the right common femoral vein.
2. Occlusive thrombus within the left common femoral vein
extending into the left proximal superficial vein and greater
saphenous vein.
3. The right popliteal vein was noted to demonstrate flow;
however, was not interrogated for compression. The left
popliteal vein and bilateral calf veins were not assessed due to
presence of brace.

[**2165-4-9**] CXR :
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
upright position. Available for comparison is the next preceding
portable
supine chest examination of the same day obtained nine hours
earlier. During the interval, the previously existing
right-sided chest tube has been removed. The lung remains well
aerated and no pneumothorax has developed. No new pulmonary
abnormalities are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
After initial resuscitation and stabilization in the trauma bay,
the patient was admitted to the trauma ICU for close monitoring
under the acute care surgery service. Her hospital course is as
follows by systems:

NEURO: The patient's pain was initially controlled with a
dilaudid PCA. Later, after she was intubated, she was placed on
a fentanyl drip. On [**4-1**], the patient had persistent decreased
mental status and both CT and MR of her head were obtained.
These showed no acute changes and her mental status changes were
attributed to her metabolic derangements and acute disease. This
was followed and returned to her baseline through the course of
her ICU stay.

CVS: The patient was transferred to our institution because of
hypotension with SBPs down to the 70s. She received close to 5L
of crystalloids and 2units of blood to support her BPs on the
first day of her accident. She was transiently placed on
pressors (levophed) in the early morning [**2165-3-27**]. Given her
history of CAD and CHF, an echo was performed [**2165-3-27**] which
revealed preserved LV global systolic function and LVEF of >55%.

PULM: At the outside hospital, the patient's O2 sats were 100%
on 2L. In the trauma bay at our institution, in the course of
attempting to place a R subclavian central line, there was
aspiration of air. A post-procedure CXR was obtained which did
not show evidence of PTX. However, later in the evening, the
patient began to desat down into the mid-80s despite increasing
her supplemental oxygen. A CXR that evening showed a large
R-sided tension PTX. The next morning on HD2, the patient was
intubated and a R-sided chest tube was placed. She remained
intubated for several days and after return from the OR with
orthopedics, while her pulmonary mechanics were sufficient for
extubation, it was determined that she would most likely not be
able to protect her airway [**2-13**] mental status and she was left
intubated. She was left intubated until her mental status was
improving, and developed a haemophilus influenzae pneumonia for
which she was treated with vancomycin and zosyn
