[**Name (STitle) 63685**] refered her to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by the

dynamic tracheobronchomalacia that may be contributing to her
frequent exacerbations.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Tracheobronchomalacia: Repeat bronchoscopy was repeated here
and confirmed severe tracheobronchomalacia, with 80-90% collapse
of trachea, right and left mainstem bronchi. It was decided that
Mrs. [**Known lastname 63686**] needed a Y stent, but it was decided to wait until
her COPD was optimized. She was continued on oral prednisone of
60mg daily. Pt had persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure
following y-stent placement, required intubation.  After she was
weaned off ventilator and extubated, she was found to have an
abg showing 7.07/128/116/39 and was reintubated and ventilated;
once she had improved, she was re-extubated but again
ineffectively ventilated and was re-intubated.  Patient was then
once again weaned, extubated and this time did well.  Pt's
hypercarbic respiratory failure was believed to be due to a
combination of severe COPD, tracheobronchomalacia, auto-peeping,
and anxiety.
After extubation, pt's respiratory status was believed to be at
baseline, PFTs were done on the day of discharge to determine
the amount of benefit from the stent placement.  Pt had a small
amount of hemoptysis following the numerous intubations, however
this seemed to be improving and was attributed to the trauma
from the intubations.
.
2) COPD exacerbation: She was continued on oral prednisone 60mg
QD, accolate (zafirlukast), theophylline and inhalers/nebs
around the clock (fluticasone/salmeterol, alb nebs, ipratroprium
nebs). She continued on BiPAP at night. She was also given
levaquin for possible bronchitis, and also received a course of
vancomycin after sputum cultures showed MSSA. Theophylline
levels were checked regularly to insure that they did not become
toxic while she was taking levaquin.  Pt wil need to weane her
prednisone, although her goal dose is not clear as she has
chronically required some steroids.
.
3) IDDM: She was continued on her outpatient insulin regimen
(NPH + regular QAM and QPM) and was covered with a Humalog
sliding scale. Despite these measures, her glucose was widely
variable and difficult to control, partially due to the oral
prednisone but also due to the fact that the patient would not
comply with a diabetic diet and ate frequently. Nutrition was
consulted.
.
4) Hyperlipidemia/Hypertriglycidemia: She was continued on her
outpatient dose of pravachol.
.
5) HTN: She was continued on her outpatient antihypertensive
regimen of verapamil, and lisinopril.
.
6) Oral thrush: She had a history of oral thrush, but on
admission it seemed to have resolved. She was given nystatin and
fluconazole while she was on a steroid taper.
.
7) FEN: She was given a diabetic, low sodium diet, but had poor
compliance with her diet. Her electrolytes were checked daily
and repleted as needed.
.
8) PPX: She was given protonix for GI prophylaxis given her
chronic steroid usage. For osteoporosis prophylaxis, she was
given calcium carbonate, vitamin D, and aledronate. For
constipation prophylaxis, she was given colace, senna, and
lactulose. For DVT prophylaxis, she was given heparin SQ.
.
9) Access: She had peripheral IVs.
