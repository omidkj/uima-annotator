Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87M h/o worsening dementia (considered [**2-12**] [**Last Name (un) 309**] body disease),
HTN, CHF, and asthma (chronically on 2 L NC at baseline)
admitted from NH ([**Hospital3 672**] Hospital) with lethargy and
hypoxia after SaO2 decreased to 60s on day of admission, and
decreased breath sounds were noted over R lung field.  T 97.2,
BP 142/80, HR 59, RR 22.  Pt was placed on 100% NRB with
improvement in O2 sats to 92%.  Pt also had decreased PO intake
X 2 weeks with a "decline" in the patient's overall condition
considered [**2-12**] worsening baseline [**Last Name (un) 309**] body disease.
.
In the ED, T 99.2, BP 149/80, HR 78, RR 30, O2 sat 99-100% on
NRB. CXR showed question of a R diaphragmatic hernia with RLL
consolidation.  Chest CTA was significant for multiple RUL
segmental pulmonary emboli, filling defects in the R mainstem
and RLL bronchi with RLL collapse, and colonic interposition
between the liver and diaphragm without evidence of bowel
obstruction or diaphragmatic hernia.  EKG showed 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**]
depressions in V5-6 with no priors to compare.  Pt was started
on a heparin gtt, ceftriaxone 1 gm IV X 1, azithromycin 500 mg
IV X 1, and 20 mEq KCL for a K 3.4.
.
Of note, pt reportedly had a CXR at the NH on [**12-23**] that showed
no infiltrates bilaterally.  Per daughter, pt has been in
hospitals or nursing homes continuously since [**10-18**] when he was
admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] with an inability to move his legs.
Pt ruled out for CVA and the daughter believes his symptoms were
secondary to [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia.  Pt had since been in rehab and
was transferred to a more acute rehab this past month, as well
as treated for a UTI.  Pt also had a chronically indwelling
Foley.
.
ROS was unable to be conducted [**2-12**] pt's mental status.

IMAGING
CXR [**1-9**]
1.  Elevated right hemidiaphragm and adjacent underlying colonic
loop suggests either colonic interposition or right-sided
diaphragmatic hernia.
2.  Consolidative changes are noted at right lung base
suggesting the presence of atelectasis/pneumonia.
.
CTA chest [**1-9**]
1.  Non-occlusive segmental pulmonary emboli seen in the right
upper lobe. These emboli are age indeterminate, although on
reformatted images, there is suggestion that these could
represent acute pulmonary emboli.
2.  Filling defects and opacification in the right mainstem and
right lower lobe bronchi, possibly representing mucoid impaction
of the endobronchial lesion cannot be excluded.  Further
evaluation with bronchoscopy is recommended.
3.  Tortuous aorta, with diffuse eccentric, ulcerated plaque.
4.  Evidence of a prior renal infarct.
5.  Colonic interposition between the liver and hemidiaphragm,
with elevated right hemidiaphragm.  No evidence of diaphragmatic
hernia.
.
CT abdomen with contrast [**1-9**]
There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, possibly
secondary to volume loss in the right lower lobe. There is no
evidence of diaphragmatic hernia.  Colonic interposition between
the diaphragm and liver, there is no evidence of bowel
obstruction.  The gallbladder, liver, pancreas, spleen, and
adrenal glands appear grossly unremarkable.  Multiple
wedge-shaped areas of decreased perfusion seen within the
kidneys bilaterally, possibly representing old infarcts.
Multiple rounded low-attenuation lesions consistent with cysts
seen within the kidneys bilaterally.  The aorta appears
diffusely tortuous, with diffuse eccentric plaque seen
throughout.  Likely left renal artery stent is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
87M h/o worsening dementia presumed to be [**2-12**] [**Last Name (un) 309**] body disease,
HTN, asthma, CHF, admitted from NH with decreased POs and
hypoxia to the 60's on 2L NC, found to have RUL segmental
non-occlusive PEs and opacification in the R mainstem and RLL
bronchi with RLL subsequent collapse, as well as PNA.  Pt
expired after supplemental O2 via high-flow face mask was
removed when pt was made CMO.
.
# Hypoxia: Pt's hypoxia considered multifactorial given (1)
non-occlusive RUL segmental PEs; (2) filling defects in R
mainstem bronchus and RLL bronchi, considered either secondary
to mucous plugging, endobronchial lesion, or aspirated food; (3)
RLL collapse; and (4) RLL ground-glass opacities most probably
[**2-12**] pneumonia given elevated temperature.  O2sat reached 99% on
high flow face mask with low grade temperature on presentation
to ICU.  Vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, aggressive
pulmonary toilet with chest PT, standing nebs, aspiration
precautions, and acetylcysteine were administered.

# Goals of Care: Because Mr. [**Known lastname 76953**] neurologic status had
been deteriorating prior to admission (assumed due to Pick's
dementia), his family believed that he would not want continued
aggressive care.  He was made CMO and O2 delivery was removed;
pt subsequently experienced respiratory failure and expired.
.
# Afib/RVR: Pt experienced one episode of Afib/RVR, which
responded to metoprolol and diltiazem; pt was later started on
digoxin, which was discontinued after pt was made CMO.
.
# Dementia: Pt experienced delirium with agitation, requiring
haloperidol and olanzapine, in setting of worsen
