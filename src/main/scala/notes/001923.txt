TTE ([**3-12**]):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesis,
akinesis of the mid and distal anterior wall and apex. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is
present (not quantified). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild to
moderate ([**12-16**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-3-8**]

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-3-12**] 9:30 AM
There has been marked improvement in pulmonary edema, still
there is mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe
retrocardiac atelectasis has decreased. There is a small left
pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable as are enlarged central pulmonary
arteries very suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Left
transvenous [**Month/Day/Year 4448**] leads terminate in standard position in
the right atrium and right ventricle. There is also a small
right pleural effusion, lesser in amount than in the left side.

IMPRESSION: Improved pulmonary edema.
.
TTE ([**3-8**]):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %)
(basal lateral wall has preserved systolic function). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. with
depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
to severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2150-8-28**],
the LVEF is now severely depressed

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2151-3-8**] 11:18 AM
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins were performed which demonstrate normal
compressibility, flow, and augmentation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
