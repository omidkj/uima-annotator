History of Present Illness:
This is a 79yo male with severe COPD and recent NSTEMI. Workup
in [**2184-8-23**] revealed multivessel coronary artery disease and
he was referred for surgical
revascularization. CABG however was initially postponed
secondary to pneumonia. He is currently undergoing outpatient
pulmonary rehab and breathing much better at this time. Since
discharge, he has been cleared by pulmonary to proceed with
surgery but remains at high risk for postoperative
complications. See full H&P from [**2184-9-21**].

Pertinent Results:
[**2184-11-29**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal inferior and inferolateral wall
hypokinesis in the setting of moderate global hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results at time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is in sinus rhythm. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is improved (LVEF = 50%) though
distal lateral and inferolateral hypokinesis remains. Right
ventricular function is unchanged. Mitral regurgitation is
unchanged. Tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged. The aorta is
intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2184-11-29**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent cornary artery bypass grafting
to three vessels. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 76780**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative day
two, he was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. He
developed rapid atriall fibrillation for which amiodarone was
started. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation.

He continued to make steady progress and was discharged to
rehabilitation on [**2184-12-4**]. He is scheduled to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as
an outpatient.
