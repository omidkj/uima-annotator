Brief Hospital Course:
He was monitored closely in the TSICU. He was alert and
responsive. He had a L flank hematoma and his hct was monitored
closely, it was stable. His diet was advanced but he had a
possible aspiration event. His o2 sats remained stable, however,
in the low 90s. He was placed on metoprolol for his tachycardia.
He was restarted on his home anti-seizure medications. He had a
speech and swallow consult.
Patient was transferred to the floor once stable. He remained on
the floor and was doing well until the evening of [**8-30**] when he
began to become agitated, stating "I've had enough," and warning
that he would leave that night despite knowing that his primary
team did not think it was wise. Pt was also aware that he was
likely to be discharged to rehab the following day. The intern
on call had multiple conversations with him totaling about 30
minutes explaining the risks of leaving against the team's
advice in his condition (requiring 4L of oxygen d/t severe COPD
and incomplete transition to rehab). As patient was ambulatory
at this time, he proceeded to walk out of floor despite advice,
after all lines were d/c'd. He was directed towards the lobby at
this time and left hospital.
