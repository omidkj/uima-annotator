woman with Marfan's disease and severe restrictive lung
disease at baseline who was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Room from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
after being found unresponsive and in respiratory distress.
At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab she was found to have an oxygen saturation of
63% on room air which improved to 97% on non rebreather.  Her
blood pressure was 70/30.  She was brought to the [**Hospital3 **]
Dopamine for hypotension and was placed on bi-pap 10/5.  Her
blood gas upon admission to the Emergency Room, PH 7.06, PCO2
165, PO2 51.  She was not able to communicate although she
was able to respond to voice and to touch.  She was given
Ampicillin, Gentamycin and Flagyl for treatment of possible
sepsis of unclear etiology.  Her blood pressure improved to
100, to 110 with Dopamine and she was transferred to the
medical Intensive Care Unit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 100.6, heart
rate 72, blood pressure 100-110/70 on Dopamine, respiratory
rate 28, oxygen saturation 97% on 100% non rebreather.
General, obtunded, not following commands, not conversing,
responsive to pain.  HEENT:  Right pupil opaque with
cataracts, left pupil reactive.  Neck, JVP 7 cm.  Chest,
absent breath sounds on the right except slight breath sounds
in the right apex, very distant breath sounds on the left.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, valvular
heart sounds.  Abdomen soft, positive bowel sounds with 10-15
cm mass in right lower quadrant.  Extremities, cool,
cyanotic.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, WBC 6.7, hemoglobin and
hematocrit 11/35.1, platelet count 286,000, MCV 95.
Differential, 76% neutrophils, 14% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes,
sodium 135, potassium 4.6, chloride 89, CO2 38, BUN 44,
creatinine 1.0, glucose 106, PT 15.6, PTT 36.5, INR 1.7.
Urinalysis, moderate blood, positive nitrites, trace ketones,
[**6-1**] RBC, [**2-24**] WBC, no bacteria, less than 1 epithelial cell.
Chest x-ray, cardiomegaly, complete opacification of right
lower lung, question air bronchogram in the left lower lung.
Arterial blood gas upon admission, 7.06/165/51.  Abdominal
ultrasound revealed that the large mass in the right lower
quadrant was the patient's liver and gallbladder.  The
patient receives all of her care at [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] and
per discussion with [**Hospital3 2576**], at baseline she has
opacification in the right lower lung consistent with her
current chest x-ray.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  It was felt that the patient's initial
sedation and hypoxia at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab were probably due to a
combination of over sedation from Benzodiazepine and Opiate
medications as well as from dehydration exacerbated by the
diuretics that she was taking.  Then when she received
supplemental oxygen she likely became hypercarbic owing to
loss of respiratory drive because at baseline she is likely a
CO2 retainer.  Per her son, her baseline oxygen saturation is
only 89-90% on room air and 94-96% on two liters.  As a
result of excessive supplemental O2, she lost her respiratory
drive.  When she was admitted to the medical Intensive Care
Unit she was initially placed on bi-pap 10/5 and the FIO2 was
weaned down to maintain an oxygen saturation greater than
90%.  Her mental status gradually improved and she was
changed to nasal cannula O2 and able to maintain oxygen
saturation of 99% on one liter of O2.  At night she continued
to require bi-pap 10/5 in order to maintain her respirations.
A house officer was called at night because her oxygen
saturation was in the 80's although she was not complaining
of any dyspnea.  Her arterial blood gas at that time was
7.37/62/50.  She was given increasing amounts of supplemental
O2 and subsequently became increasingly hypercarbic and
unresponsive.  She was thus transferred to the medical
Intensive Care Unit and was placed on non invasive mask
ventilation because she appeared to be in significant
respiratory distress and to be fatiguing.  Her mental status
gradually cleared over the course of 24 hours and she
required progressively less supplemental O2 such that within
24 hours she was satting at 99% on 35% O2 by face mask.  It
was felt that her desaturation into the 80's at night is part
of her normal baseline. Given her large abdominal
contents and her complaints of dyspnea when lying flat, it
was felt that she breathes poorly when she is lying down
because her abdominal content press heavily against her
diaphragm.  Therefore, she should be kept lying down at at
least a 45 degree angle even when she is sleeping at night.

2.  Infectious Disease:  Owing to her abnormal baseline chest
x-ray, it is impossible to ascertain whether or not she has a
pneumonia present.  However, given her lack of fever as well
as lack of elevated white blood cell count and lack of cough,
it was unlikely that she had a pneumonia present.  She had
initially been started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl
in the Intensive Care Unit.  Subsequently Vancomycin and
Flagyl were discontinued and she was placed on Levofloxacin
to finish a 7 day course for possible sinusitis because she
complains of chronic baseline nasal discharge.

3.  Cardiovascular:  She was hypotensive to the 70's
initially when she presented to the hospital.  Her blood
pressure improved with Dopamine and also with fluids.  She
was able to be weaned off Dopamine quickly and maintained her
blood pressure at about 100 which per her son is her
baseline.  During her second episode of hypercarbia and
hypoxia which was on the floor, her blood pressure dropped
into the 70's.  The hypotension was likely due to a
combination of vasodilation from hypocarbia as well as volume
depletion.

4.  Hematologic:  She is status post valve replacement and
goal INR should be 2.5 to 3.5. Her INR was 1.7 upon admission
and she was started on Coumadin 7.5 mg q d (at home she takes
5 mg po q d).  On hospital day #2 her INR was 4.3, hospital
day #3 it was 6.5.  Consequently Coumadin was held for the
time being.

5.  Renal:  She appeared to be dehydrated initially, based
upon her hypotension as well as elevated BUN to creatinine
ratio.  She does take diuretics at baseline, presumably for
her congestive heart failure.  Given her hypotension, her
diuretics were held during this hospitalization.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  She had a large right sided abdominal
mass found on physical exam.  On ultrasound this is found to
represent both her liver and gallbladder.  These findings are
consistent with likely tympanic congestion from right sided
heart failure secondary to valvular disease and Marfan's
disease as well as to downward displacement because the right
hea
