Chief Complaint:
Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2195-4-15**] 1. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, right neck. 2.
Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma subcutaneous tissue scalp. 3.
Reconstruction of scalp defect with a split-thickness skin graft
from the right leg. 4. Lymph node biopsy left posterior neck.

History of Present Illness:
INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male with a known
history of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma
involving the central portion of the occipital parietal scalp
which was excised using a Mohs technique. It was noted at the
time of resection that he had lymphovascular invasion. He
received postoperative radiation therapy. More recently, he
noted a mass in the right neck and over the ensuing period of
time, over the past several weeks, other masses became evident
in the right posterior neck which seemed to enlarge.
They also became quite painful. Clinically he was also found to
have an additional lymph node on the contralateral side in the
mid portion of level V. CT scan corroborated all of these
findings. Findings consistent with metastatic squamous cell
carcinoma of the right neck with deep invasion into the
prevertebral musculature. The brachial plexus and phrenic nerve
were preserved.

Pathology Examination
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: Left neck lymph node, Scalp lesion, Modified
radical neck dissection w/ dissection of deep cervical
musculature.
Procedure date  [**2195-4-15**]
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Lymph node, left neck (A-B):
Poorly differentiated carcinoma consistent with metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma in one lymph node.  See note and case
comment.
Note:  There is extracapsular extension.  Immunostain for P63,
cytokeratin, and CK7 are positive, chromogranin and S-100 are
negative.  The immunostains and histology favor a diagnosis of a
poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.  Synaptophysin
stain is focally positive.  This stain is not specific, however,
neuroendocrine differentiation cannot be completely excluded.
CK20 is negative speaking against [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5668**] cell carcinoma.  LMP
(EBV) is negative.
2.  Skin, scalp, excision (C-K):
-Dermal malignant neoplasm consistent with poorly differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma, completely excised.  See note.
-Actinic keratosis, completely excised.
-Medial calcinosis of vessels.
Note: The lack of epidermal involvement favors a dermal
metastasis.  The histology is similar to that of the nodal
carcinoma.
3.  Modified radical neck dissection with dissection of deep
cervical musculature (L-[**Doctor Last Name **]):
-Level II: Twelve lymph nodes; no malignancy identified.
-Level III: Eight out of fourteen lymph nodes with metastatic
carcinoma.
-Level IV: Five out of nine lymph nodes with metastatic
carcinoma.
-Level V: Ten out of eleven lymph nodes with metastatic
carcinoma.
Note: There is a total of 23 of 46 nodes positive for carcinoma.
 Some of the lymph nodes show extracapsular extension.  Slides
AB-AE, Level V, show tumor with necrosis involving muscle, fat,
and possibly may completely involve a lymph node (included in
lymph node count), however, no definitive lymphoid tissue is
identified.  This may represent a soft tissue metastasis.
Case comment:  The previous specimen (Mohs debulk - S07-[**Numeric Identifier 8118**])
is reviewed.  The specimen shows a moderately differentiated
squamous cell carcinoma extending from the epidermis and more
poorly differentiated carcinoma which is predominantly dermal.
The  poorly differentiated carcinoma is similar to that observed
in current lymph nodes and skin specimen.  There is some
transition which suggests this is the primary site of the
carcinoma, however, the possibility that there are two separate
tumors in that specimen cannot be completely excluded.  The
poorly differentiated histology and extensive nodal involvement
are somewhat unusual for a cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and
raise consideration of a primary site from the head or neck
region. Clinical-pathologic correlation is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted on [**2195-4-15**] and underwent resection of scalp
mass, STSG, and neck dissection. Two JP drains were left in
place. Pt received perioperative clindamycin which was continued
while the drains were in place. Coumadin was held while drains
were in place. Foley catheter was removed on POD#1. JP output
was serosanguinous with 75cc and 100cc over 24h in each drain.
On POD#2 worsening swelling was noted in the neck
dissection/resection bed site. JP output increased to approx
100cc per drain over 24h and remained serosanguinous. On POD#2
([**4-17**]) pt was taken back to the operating room for R neck
exploration and evacuation of hematoma/seroma and two new JP
drains were placed. On [**4-17**] JP output was 35 and 80
serosanguinous with decreased edema. JP output increased to 250
and 170 on [**4-18**] though edema over Right neck was decreased. On
[**4-19**] output continued to be elevated at 185 and 225, was serous
in quality, and neck continued to be flat in contour. Drain
output slowly declined during his post-operative course. On [**4-22**]
(POD [**6-27**]) increasing erythema was noticed around the drain site
and inferior staple line. Pt was empirically started on
Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin. Clindamycin was discontinued at
this time. Gram stain of the JP bulb fluid revealed
Gram-Negative rods. On [**4-24**] JP drain culture grew out
pan-sensitive Serratia Marcescens. Vancomycin was discontinued.
Erythema improved. The pt remained afebrile during this time. On
[**4-25**] One of the JP drains was removed. The remaining JP drain
continued to have high outputs on the order of 200-300 cc/day,
though it was clear and serous in quality. On [**4-27**] a compression
dressing was fashioned over the right neck region with
[**Location (un) **] straps. On [**4-28**] JP bulb was replaced with gravity
drainage bag. Drain o
