Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
89yoM with 4v CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1, SVG-OM, SVG-AM in [**2132**]),
chronic systolic HF 35%, DM with neuropathy, h/o stroke s/p L
ICA stenting, CKD, peripheral and carotid artery disease
admitted to CCU for SOB and increasing angina.
.
Last night he had some angina (see below), dry cough, and SOB
last night for which he took his home inhalers and a SL NTG
without relief. He went to bed but did not sleep well overnight.
This am his relatives checked up on him and noted him to be SOB,
"felt like he was going to die" per family, so EMS was called
and he was brought to the hospital on a non-rebreather.
.
He triggered on arrival to ED and looked very poor, with RR 38
and 79%RA -> 98% on 10L NRB, otherwise temp 98.7  p92  147/79.
Comboneb was given, Bipap'ed with PS 10 for 2 hrs, then on NRB
and desat to 89% when put on 6L NC so put back on NRB. Was given
40 mg IV Lasix with 800 cc UOP through ED, and started on Nitro
gtt. Foley placed with some BRB in bag, thought due to BPH. 325
ASA given.
.
Vitals before transfer: 97.2  111/52  73  19  99%NRB.
.
On further interview with pt and family, he has not had
significant angina in the past year or two. However, for the
past [**2-15**] wks, he's had increasing frequency of left sided chest
discomfort (slight radiation to his L arm) up to 4 times in the
past week, associated with exertion (making the bed, or when he
was rushing to meet someone, or with anxiety) for which he took
[**2-15**] SL NTG's in the past week; he states he only seldomly used
them previously. Of note, PCP note in [**6-/2150**] indicates
occasional angina for which he would do nothing and that he'd
had it "off and on over the years."
.
Also endorsed increased BLE edema from not using his stockings;
he has not had an increase in sleeping with 3 pillows, and his
wt is down to 143 from 153 intentionally. Endorses med
compliance and low salt diet; however his family states possible
salty diet. No PND, palpitations, LOS, dizziness.
.
ROS: denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, LH,
palpitations, but some "sweatiness" last night. All other ROS
negative.

EKG [**10-24**]:  Sinus rhythm. Prolonged A-V conduction is now
present. Non-specific ST-T wave changes are present. Compared to
the previous tracing findings are not significantly different.

ECHO [**10-26**]:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferolateral and distal half of the anterior
septum and near akinesis of the distal third of the left
ventricle with an apical aneurysm and akinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 25-30 %). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-15**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive
regional systolic dysfunction and apical aneurysm c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2149-5-12**],
the findings are similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].
Based on [**2146**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

CXR [**10-26**]:  As compared to the prior examination, moderate
pulmonary edema is similar in extent. No pneumothorax is seen. A
moderate right-sided pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis
are likely present. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Median sternotomy
wires and markers and mediastinal clips from CABG are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
89yoM with 4v CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1, SVG-OM, SVG-AM in [**2132**]),
chronic systolic HF 35%, DM with neuropathy, h/o stroke s/p L
ICA stenting, CKD, peripheral and carotid artery disease
admitted to CCU with SOB, worsening angina, and pulmonary edema
consistent with acute on chronic systolic heart failure.
.
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Patient presented
with symptoms of worsening angina and SOB.  Upon arrival to the
ED patient triggered with RR 38 and 79%RA was placed on a NRB.
Comboneb was given and patient put on BiPAP after diuresis his
condition improved and was placed on nitro drip for afterload
reduction.  Inpatinet ECHO showed a EF 30% which was largely
unchanged from the prior.  Patient was treated wih aggressive
diuresis and had an improvement in his symptoms.  Exact cause of
the patient's decompensation was unclear, but likely related to
dietary non-compliance and under dosing of home diuretic.
Patient was continued on ramipril 5 mg and digoxin 250 mcg every
third day and metoprolol tartrate was changed to metoprolol
succinate and increased to 75 mg daily.  Patient was
transitioned to PO diuretics and discharged at a weight of 139
pounds.
.
2. Coronary artery disease: S/p 4v CABG in [**2132**] with last
nuclear in [**2143**] showing multiple fixed perfusion defects.
