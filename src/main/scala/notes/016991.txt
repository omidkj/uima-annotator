Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
pneumonia, bronchus intermedius-neoesophageal fistula

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and chest tube
placement, metallic stent placement in the bronchus intermedius,
Flexible bronchoscopy and stent revision, bronchoscopy, Right
thoracotomy and repair of bronchoesophageal
fistula using a pedicled latissimus dorsi flap, takedown of
the gastric conduit and creation of the left cervical end
esophagostomy (split fistula), Laparotomy, G-tube and J-tube
placement, Flexible bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar
lavage, Percutaneous tracheostomy tube


History of Present Illness:
 63M with hx of esophageal CA s/p chemo/radiation, esophagectomy
transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after found to have severe
PNA and a fistula from bronchus intermedius to neoesophagus
through gastric conduit. Pt had recently been admitted in [**6-12**]
for cardiac stenting for 100% stenosis of RCA using BMS. On
[**7-17**], pt admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] and underwent Right thoracotomy
with esophagectomy and J-tube placement, complicated by SBO
thought due to stricture at duodonal anastamosis. Patient went
back to hospital on [**8-16**], found to have severe PNA and also went
into rapid a-fib which was controlled with diltiazem drip.
Patient had worsening respiratory status, and was intubated.
After intubation, significant leak was discovered on vent, and
on CT, patient was found to have broncho-neoesophageal fistula.
Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On
arrival, an a-line was placed and CVL was replaced. Thoracic
srgery bronched the patient and found a 1 cm fistula at the
bronchus intermedius.
Prolonged intubation time, unable to wean from ventilator,
required pressors on several occasions.  Trach and PEG placed.
Patiemt on ventilator and unable to wean.  Family made patient
DNR (no pressors) and then CMO, patient was taken off the
ventilator and expired shortly thereafter.  PCP and ME notified.

Past Medical History:
prostate CA, COPD, CAD s/p stenting, CHF (EF 40-45%, mild
hypokinesia), ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40-45%, mild
hypokinesia), OA, GERD, esophageal CA s/p chemo, radiation adn
surgical resection
PSH: radical prostatectomy, appendectomy, PEG placement,


Social History:
Lives with wife, who is primarily Portuguese
speaking. Has son & daughter as well as grandchildren.  Family
is
described by daughter as "close."  His daughter is the HCP.

Family History:
No lung cancer or congenital lung diseases

[**2113-8-22**] CXR x3 : Last one showed improved aeration of right
upper lobe.
[**2113-8-23**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats.
Right bundle-branch block.  Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2113-8-19**] the findings are similar. Left atrial abnormality
persists.
[**2113-8-23**] CXR: Diminished aeration of the left lung and improved
aeration of the right lung and decrease in size of right pleural
effusion after repositionning of ETT in the trachea. Left
perihilar consolidation or edema may have worsened.
[**2113-8-23**] CXR: Bilateral widespread opacities, which could
represent infection or aspiration overlying edema, remain
unchanged in comparison to the prior radiograph.
[**2113-8-23**] CXR:Bilateral widespread opacities, which could
represent infection or aspiration overlying edema, remain
unchanged in comparison to the prior radiograph.
[**2113-8-24**] stomach path:  Few areas of mucosal ischemia, with
single ulcer involving muscularis propria, No carcinoma seen,
Bronchoesophageal fistula.
[**2113-8-24**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The apex is
hypkinetic. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2113-8-22**], apical hypokinesis of the left and right
ventricle is now seen.
[**2113-8-24**] CXR: In comparison with the study of earlier in this
date, there is little change. Multiple monitoring and support
devices remain in place with no definite pneumothorax. Extensive
bilateral pleural opacifications persist.

premature beats including couplets. Right bundle-branch block.
