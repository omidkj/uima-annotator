63 yo female was in good health until 3 weeks ago when she
thought she had the flu. Treated with abx and eventually
developed severe SOB. Admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-27**]. She had
NSTEMI with ST depression and a + troponin. Treated with heparin
and admitted to the CCU. Cardiac cath there [**3-28**] revealed severe
3VD and [**1-29**]+ MR. On [**3-31**] she had 3 DES placed in the CX. Loaded
with plavix and has had a continued daily dose. Treated with
ACE-I and beta blocker, but did not tolerate them well.
Transferred here for MVR/CABG.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focalities
in the basal, m id and apical lateral walls. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40
%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 76883**]
at 8AM before surgical incision.

Post_Bypass:
Normal RV systolic function.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Post repair, there is a mitral annular prosthesis which is
stable and functioning well. There is a mild residual mitral
regurgitation and at worst a mild to moderate degree with the
vitals at 110/70. This was conveyed to DR.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Trivial TR. No AI.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 76883**] was admitted on [**4-7**] and completed a pre-operative
workup. A pre-operative echo and CT of chest to evaluate aorta
were completed. Dental clearance was obtained. A carotid
ultrasoun showed 40-59% [**Doctor First Name 3098**] and 60-69% [**Country **] stenoses. She
underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-11**].  She tolerated the
surgery well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on titrated phenylephrine, epinephrine, and propofol
drips. Ms. [**Known lastname 76883**] was extubated later that day. Her chest
tubes were removed. Her beta-blockade was titrated as tolerated.
 She was transferred to the floor on POD #3 to begin increasing
her activity level. Her pacing wires were removed and her
diuresis was continued.  By post operative day six she was ready
for discharge to home.
