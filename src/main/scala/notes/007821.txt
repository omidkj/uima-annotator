History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 34891**] is a 66 year-old female with h/o hepatic
encephalopathy transferred from an OSH with mental status
changes and hypoxia. On day of admit, she was noted to have
mental status changes, unable to speak, and lethergic more than
usual. She had a FS glucose in the 50s with improvement in
mental status with [**Location (un) 2452**] juice. She also was noted to be
acutely hypoxic and cyanotic during this episode. She was
transferred to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital but requested to be
transferred here.
.
Of note, she had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] for mental status
changes and RLL cellulitis. Her mental status changes were
thought to be secondary to hepatic dysfunction, seizure, or low
tolerance of hypoglycemia. She was admitted to rehab for
management of the necrotic wound on her RLL, discharged, and
treated with vanc/cefepime and VAC dressing.
.
In the ED, CXR showed infiltrate vs atelectasis and she was
started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone. EKG showed non-specific
ST changes, trop 0.04, ammonia 25. She was also noted to have
elevated coags with INR 1.5, PTT 44.9, and total bili 1.8. BNP
was markedly elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 34892**]. A V/Q scan was performed to rule
out PE (renal failure CI CT PE protocol) which was
indeterminate. Head CT was negative. She was admitted to
medicine in stable condition for further assessment.

STUDIES:
[**8-6**] - Lung Perfusion Scan - Indeterminate VQ scan.
[**8-6**] - CXR - L retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis, although
pneumonia cannot be excluded and as such adjacent pleural
effusion may represent parapneumonic effusion.
[**8-6**] - CT head - Somewhat limited study due to motion. No acute
intracranial pathology identified.
[**8-7**] - CT abdomen/pelvis - Limited study. b/l moderate small
pleural
effusions. Small amount of perihepatic ascites and anasarca.
Small fat-containing right inguinal hernia. Nodular liver
suggestive of cirrhosis.
[**8-7**] - Renal US - Very limited study terminated prior to
completion but shows an unremarkable appearing right kidney.
[**8-7**] - Bilateral LE US - No evidence of DVT
[**8-8**] - CT head (s/p unwitnessed fall on the floor) - No evidence
of acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
[**8-9**] - EEG - consistent with non-convulsive status epilepticus.
The accompanying video did not demonstrate any clear change in
state with
the discharges. The left-sided predominance suggests a potential
area of
cortical irritability and epileptogenesis in the left posterior
quadrant.
[**8-9**] - Echo - mildly dilated LA. normal LV wall thickness.
mildly dilated LV cavity. Overall LV systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). no VSD. RV free wall is
hypertrophied. RV cavity is dilated with depressed systolic
funtion. number of AV [**Month/Year (2) 11719**] cannot be determined. AV [**Month/Year (2) 11719**]
are mildly thickened. no AV stenosis. no AR. mildly thickened MV
[**Month/Year (2) 11719**]. no MVP. Mild (1+) MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 11719**] are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.
no pericardial effusion.
[**8-10**] - EEG - Compared to the prior day's recording, discharges
were less pronounced and were more often isolated and not
organized into prolonged electrographic seizures.
[**8-15**] - EEG -  This is an abnormal routine EEG due to rare left
temporal
sharp wave discharges as well as rare isolated generalized
blunted sharp
and slow wave discharges, indicative of continued cortical
irritability
and potentional for epileptogensis. No repetive or sustained
discharges
were seen and no electrographic seizures were noted. In
addition, there
were frequent bursts of generalized delta frequency slowing in
the
setting of a slow and disorganized background, indicative of a
moderate
encephalopathy. This suggests deep midline or bilateral
subcortical
dysfunction
[**8-15**] - Abdominal US - Limited. Trace ascites, and none that can
be drained.
[**8-17**] Oropharyngeal Videofluoroscopy: Mild oral and pharyngeal
dysphagia with consistent penetration and occasional aspiration
with thin liquids.


Brief Hospital Course:
Below is a brief summary of her hospital course by problem:
.
# MS changes - The etiology of her mental status change remained
unclear, though was felt to be most likely secondary to hepatic
encephalopathy +/- acute renal failure. On her recent admission,
she had episodes of decreased responsiveness and waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status thought likely secondary to metabolic derangements
associated with polypharmacy, hepatic dysfunction, seizures, or
very low tolerance to hypoglycemia. Neurologic work-up including
TSH, B12, folate, MRI/MRA head were unremarkable. She was
started on Keppra during that admission for question of possible
clinical seizures. She was followed by neurology again on this
admission, who felt the etiology was most likely due to
metabolic abnormalities. Tox screen was negative. EEG showed
epileptiform activity and it was thought that her mental status
changes could also be confusion associated with seizure activity
or post-ictal confusion. It was thought most likely secondary to
hepatic encephalopathy. She was treated with lactulose and
rifamixin and improvement, though gradual, was noted. Her mental
status waxed and waned over the course of  her admission with
overall gradual improvement. She was maintained on keppra and
started on dilantin for seizures. It was later decided that she
did not require two anti-epileptic meds and dilantin was weaned
(to receive last dose on [**9-6**]). On day of discharge, she
continues to have waxing and [**Do
