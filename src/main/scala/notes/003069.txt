Hypotension

None.

History of Present Illness:
56 with history of tonsillar cancer (post XRT in [**2140**], post
trach/PEG, recurrent aspiration PNA) presents from [**Hospital1 1099**] rehab with hypotension. Of note, he was just recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for septic shock in [**2-21**] and to [**Hospital1 2177**] in [**5-3**] for
the same problem. Over the past 6 months he has had recurrent
aspiration and has been ventilator dependent.
.
He presented to the ED with hypotension. He was transferred for
BP in 70-80. He was given fluid bolus at [**Hospital3 672**] with no
response and hence transferred here. He was also reported had
change in mental status. His initial vitals were T101.8 P120
BP84/50. He was given 1L NS, flagyl, levaquin, 1L LR and 1u
PRBC. He refused central line twice in the ED. Sepsis protocol
was thus not initiated. He was also found to be profoundly
anemic, with leuckocytosis and severe diarrhea with is guiac
positive.

CT LOW EXT W&W/O C BILAT  [**2150-5-17**] 12:59 PM

CT LOWER EXTREMITY: The left adductor magnus muscle is expanded
to 7.3 x 7.1 cm, with high-density fluid consistent with blood.
The right adductor muscle, at the same level measures 2.5 x 3.0
cm. The hematoma extends to the level of the pubic symphysis
superiorly, and to the distal femur/knee inferiorly.
Additionally, high-density fluid fills the gluteus maximus
muscle posteriorly. Fat stranding is seen throughout the imaged
left leg. On post-contrast imaging, there was no evidence of
arterial active bleed. There are diffuse vascular
calcifications. Air is seen within the bladder, without a
visualized Foley catheter in place.

BONE WINDOWS: Mild degenerative changes are seen. There is no
visible disruption of the cortex, periosteal reaction, or sinus
tract within the left femur to indicate osteomyelitis.
Degenerative changes are seen along the pubic symphysis,
bilateral hips. There are diffuse vascular calcifications.

IMPRESSION:
1) Large left hematoma, without CT evidence of active bleeding.
If arterial source is clinically suspected this should be
evaluated with conventional angiography.
2) No bony changes to suggest the presence of an abscess, or
osteomyelitis.
3) Air within the bladder, without presence of Foley catheter.
Reasons for this could include recent instrumentation, recent
removal of Foley catheter, versus infectious etiology.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2150-5-16**] 5:37 PM
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The study is extremely limited
secondary to difficulty with patient positioning. There is an
opacity in the left lower lobe, which may represent pneumonia.
There is a small left pleural effusion. The remainder of the
lung fields is unchanged from prior study. A tracheostomy tube
is seen with the tube tip approximately 6 cm above the carina.
The soft tissue and osseous structures are unchanged from prior
study.

IMPRESSION: Limited study. There appears to be an opacity in the
left lower lobe, which may represent pneumonia. Additionally,
there appears to be a small left pleural effusion. Recommend
repeat evaluation with PA and lateral chest radiographs.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2150-5-16**] 11:13 PM
There is paucity of the air throughout the abdomen. Air is
probably noted in the ascending and transverse colon and
rectosigmoid. No evidence of obstruction. No evidence of toxic
megacolon.

There is probably a small bilateral pleural effusion. Patchy
opacity is seen in the left lower lobe. If clinically indicated,
please evaluate with chest x-rays. The free air is not well
examined on this supine abdominal film.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
56yo M with tonsillar cancer, recurrent aspiration penumonia,
ventilator dependent, diabetes who presented with sepsis and
acute hematocrit drop with goal of care comfort measures only

#ID:The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, fever,
18% bandemia but with lactate 1.9 with possible sources
including cdiff, LLL PNA, and UTI. Initial CXR was clear. His
stool cultures were pending but he had diarrhea in the setting
of recent antibiotics and thus flagyl for possible Cdiff was
started. The pt and his family subsequently requested comfort
measures only and specified that all antibiotics, additional
IVs, blood draws etc be discontinued for comfort. After this
decision was made, pt's sputum culture was found to have
klebsiella sensitive to only imipenum and meropenum and
pansensitive pseudomonas resistant only to ciprofloxacin. Stool
cultures and Cdiff were negative.  No antibiotics were continued
on discharge (patient was made CMO after discussion with patient
and family), and he was discharged to hospice.
.
#anemia- The patient was found to be anemic believed to be
secondary to a hematoma in the left medial thigh. The etiology
remains unclear but it may have been related to a femoral stick
at an outside hospital. His initial hct in the ED was 15. He was
transfused 2 units pRBC's with an increase to 24. A CT scan of
his left thigh showed a hematoma with suspected ongoing bleed
based on appearance. A source was not localized. His repeat Hct
was 21. A pressure gauze was placed on his left leg and he was
transfused an additional 2 units for suspected ongoing bleed.
Vascular surgery was consulted as well for potential surgical
intervention, however family wished for no invasive procedures,
only supportive care.
.
#respiratory : The patient was initially continued on outpatient
ventilatory settings. He was treated prn with anti-anxiety
medications. On [**5-18**], a family meeting was held with the
patient's daughter ([**Name (NI) 12230**]) and an aunt who agreed that the
patient would want the ventilator to be discontinued as well. He
tolerated this well and was placed on a trach maskl. He
maintained o2 sats in the high 90-100 range.
.
#FEN: Pt was initial kept NPO. Pt expressed that he was a hungry
and a desire to eat/drink. He was started on bolus tube feeds
through his J tube.

#code-DNR/DNI/CMO. Had family meeting on [**5-17**] and [**5-18**] where
daughter and aunt agreed that the patient would not aggressive
measures at this time. This includes intubation, pressors, IVs,
lab draws, antibiotics. They are agreeable to IV only for pain
meds in the case he loses IV access. The patient cannot take PO
MSO4 (including liquid form). After transfer to the floor,
palliative care was consulted.  He was ultimately discharged to
hospice care.

#Communication -aunt very involved with his care although
daughters
are official healthcare proxy.
