Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2199-11-5**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
LVEF=60%.
4. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility.
5. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened . There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is mild MAC.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2199-11-5**] where
the patient underwent Coronary Artery Bypass x 4 with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **].  Please see operative note for further details.  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  On [**2199-11-8**] HCT was 20% he transfused with 2
units of red cells to a HCT of 27%.  The patient was evaluated
by the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  He did develop ecchymosis of the left thigh.  Dark
blood mixed with clot was expressed from the JP exit site of the
right leg.  There was no erythema of the wound and hematocrit
continued to rise.  The patient is advised to keep the left leg
and thigh wrapped for 3 days.  By the time of discharge on POD 6
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was
discharged home in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions.  He will have Free Care medications.  He will not
