History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 349**] is a 50 yo male with history of lymphoma as a
child, now in remission for many years, HLD, and current smoker
(30 PY) who presents with shortness of breath.  He does not have
any known history of COPD or asthma.  He reports that he has had
intermittent cough and viral symptoms for the past 1-2 months,
but he has not been SOB until about 3 days ago.  He has had
severe cough and some wheezing for the past 3 days as well.
Cough is productive of clear sputum.  He reports low grade
fevers for 1 day, low 100s in ED.  He denies chills, chest pain
or pressure.  He was admitted to OSH earlier today, he was given
steroids and antibiotics, but eloped as he was unstatisfied with
their care.  He was still SOB so came here for further
evaluation.  He denies any recent sick contacts.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 98.2, HR 117, BP 135/73, RR 18,
SpO2 90% on RA.  Patient was found to be tachypneic and wheezy
on exam.  His peak flow was noted to be 200.  He was given
Duonebs x3, Solumedrol, Ceftriaxone, and Azithromycin.  No
elevated WBC, but lactate increased at 4.4.  EKG showed sinus
tachycardia at 112, no ischemia.  CTA chest was negative for PE.
 His VS prior to transfer were: T 98.5, HR 110, BP 139/79, SpO2
96% on NRB.

Imaging / Studies:
# CHEST (PA & LAT) ([**2166-2-16**] at 11:29 PM):
FINDINGS: AP and lateral chest with no prior for comparison
demonstrates low lung volumes, though the lungs are clear. There
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is at the
upper limits of normal for size, the mediastinal contours are
unremarkable. The pulmonary vasculature appears normal.
IMPRESSION: No acute thoracic pathology.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY ([**2166-2-17**] at 2:30 AM):
FINDINGS: Vascular opacification is somewhat suboptimal, but no
pulmonary embolism is present to the level of the segemental
vessels. The main pulmonary artery is slightly enlarged
measuring 3.2 cm. The thoracic aorta appears within normal
limits. No pericardial, or pleural effusions are present.
Minimal bibasilar dependent atelectasis is present. Otherwise,
the lungs are clear and the airways are patent. No significant
hilar, mediastinal, or axillary lymphadenopathy is present. In
the right lobe of the thyroid is a 14-mm nodule, a small nodule
is present in the left lobe. Although not evaluated for
subdiaphragmatic evaluation, the liver appears diffusely fatty
infiltrated without focal lesions. Remainder of the abdomen
appears normal.
BONE WINDOWS: Spinal degenerative changes are present but no
suspicious bone lesions are present.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism. Main pulmonary artery is somewhat
enlarged, could indicate pulmonary hypertension.
2. Thyroid nodules, for which ultrasound should be performed to
better evaluate.
3. Fatty liver without focal lesions; however, this evaluation
for lesions is limited on this study.

Portable TTE ([**2166-2-18**] at 8:37:01 AM):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No definite atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ([**2166-2-18**] at 4:48 AM):
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-16**], there is no interval
change or evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease. Relatively
low lung volumes but no pneumonia, vascular congestion, or
pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo male with a history of childhood lymphoma in remission
after chemotherapy and radiation, HLD, and significant smoking
history (30 PY) who presents with shortness of breath.

Dyspnea/Hypoxia: very likely related to a severe viral pneumonia
or an atypical pneumonia.  CTA of the chest without PE or any
infiltrate.  Viral
