.
[**1-9**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity, atelectasis or
consolidation.
.
[**1-12**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
Right IJ catheter tip is in the cavoatrial junction. The aorta
is tortuous. Bibasilar opacities are likely atelectasis and are
unchanged. The lungs are hyperinflated. There is no pneumothorax
or enlarging pleural effusion.
.
[**1-13**] CXR: FINDINGS: Interval removal of right internal jugular
vascular catheter with no evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged
cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. New patchy
opacities have developed at the periphery of both lung bases and
are nonspecific. Their rapid development favors either
atelectasis or aspiration over infectious pneumonia, but a
followup radiograph may be helpful in this regard. There are
probable small pleural effusions.
.
[**1-10**] Renal Ultrasound: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of
obstruction. 2. Unchanged right renal stone. 3. Multiple
bilateral renal cysts, not significantly changed from prior.
.
[**2102-1-9**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Right
bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Consider
left ventricular hypertrophy. Consider prior anterior myocardial
infarction, although it is non-diagnostic. Anterolateral ST-T
wave abnormalities are primary and they are non-specific. Since
