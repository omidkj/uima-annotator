Pertinent Results:
[**2188-11-15**] Intraop TEE Report:
The patient developed cardiogenic shock from myocardial ischemia
several minutes after the inductuion of general anesthesia. Due
to this, no pre-bypass echocardiographic imaging could be
performed. This study is composed of post bypass imaging
obtained with the patient receiving epinephrine and
norepinephrine by infusion and in sinus rhythm.

POST BYPASS No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with moderate mid to distal septal and anteroseptal
as well as apical hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The right
ventricular cavity appears somewhat dilated with normal free
wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91748**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service. Given
his critical left main lesion, he remained in the CVICU and was
started on intravenous Heparin. He remained pain free and stable
intravenous therapy. Preoperative evaluation was unremarkable
and he was cleared for surgery. The following day, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
Operative course was notable for cardiogenic shock from
myocardial ischemia several minutes after the inductuion of
general anesthesia. This required resuscitative efforts and
emergent surgical intervention. For further operative details,
please see operative note. Following surgery, he was admitted
back to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
He maintained stable hemodynamics and weaned from inotropic
support without difficulty. On postoperative day two, he
transferred to the SDU for further care and recovery. Beta
blockade was resumed and advanced as tolerated. He remained in a
normal sinus rhythm. Over several days, he continued to make
clinical improvement with diuresis and was eventually cleared
for discharge to home on postoperative day four. Prior to
discharge, all appropriate followup appointements were arranged.
