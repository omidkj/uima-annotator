CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and stridor.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old white male
with hypertension, history of congestive heart failure,
multiple malignancies with metastases, who presented on
[**2194-3-15**] with shortness of breath, chest pain, lower
extremity edema, and purulent discharge from infected site
from thyroidectomy on [**2194-1-29**].

The patient was on three days of dicloxacillin for the wound
infection prior to presentation.  The patient had a total
thyroidectomy on [**2194-1-29**] for advanced papillary thyroid
cancer with invasion of the esophagus and the right laryngeal
nerve.  The esophagus was entered and repaired, and the right
laryngeal nerve was sacrificed during the operation.

Postoperatively, the patient received radioactive iodine for
adjuvant chemotherapy.  Eight days ago he developed swelling
and erythema to the surgical wound site in his neck and upper
chest.  He was started on dicloxacillin by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 574**].
Three days after initiation of treatment, he had purulent
discharge from the site and developed progressively worsening
stridor, dyspnea, and orthopnea (unable to sleep supine), one
episode of chest pain (nonradiating, lasting seconds), and
lower extremity edema.  He had fever.  He denies chills,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rashes,
constipation, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, and palpitations.

Myocardial infarction was ruled out per serial creatine
kinase and troponin I (troponin I level was 0.3).  CT of the
neck showed severe focal narrowing of larynx and trachea.  He
was admitted to Intensive Care Unit on [**2194-3-15**] and
underwent bronchoscopy with dilation, followed by open
tracheostomy.  Currently, had tracheostomy tube with oxygen
mask.  He may have had a previous chest x-ray showing mild
congestive heart failure and calcified granuloma in the left
middle lung.  Treated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with
cefazolin for operative infection.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination, vital signs revealed temperature of 98.3, pulse
of 67, blood pressure of 150/90, respiratory rate of 20,
saturation of 97% on 10 liters.  On physical examination, the
patient appeared in no acute distress, alert and oriented.
Could not speak, but appeared comfortable.  Tracheostomy tube
was in place.  There was an oxygen mask near the tube.  The
patient is Russian-speaking.  Head and neck examination
showed mild conjunctival injection (right more than left),
and xanthelasma.  Head examination also showed supraorbital
swelling.  Pupils were equal and reactive to light.
Extraocular movements were intact.  The oropharynx was moist
and clear.  On neck examination, the neck was tender near the
wound, tracheostomy tube was in place.  There was no purulent
drainage.  The patient had active secretions from the
tracheostomy tube.  On heart examination, first heart sound
and second heart sound were audible, a regular rate and
rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  No jugular venous
distention.  No carotid bruits.  On lung examination, there
was good air movement bilaterally, coarse breath sounds with
diffuse bilateral crackles, rhonchi, bilateral wheezes, loud
air sounds from the tracheostomy tube in the upper lobes.  On
abdominal examination, bowel sounds were present.  The
abdomen was soft and nontender, slightly distended.  Liver
was 5 cm below the costal margin.  No masses palpated.  On
examination of extremities, he had fine pulses in the feet,
normal pulses in the hands.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
On skin examination, he had multiple seborrheic keratosis and
skin tags and was hirsute.  On neurologic examination,
cerebellar examination was within normal limits.  Cerebral
examination was within normal limits.  Cranial nerves were
intact and within normal limits.  Preserved touch sensation.
Muscular strength was 4+, brisk deep tendon reflexes.  Intact
motor function in all extremities, and in the head and neck.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
revealed a white blood cell count of 11.2, platelets of 765,
hematocrit of 40.3.  Coagulation studies were within normal
limits.  Chem-7 was notable for an increased creatinine
of 1.6 (this is his baseline).  Blood sugar was 114.  Calcium
level was 8.3.  Magnesium and phosphate levels were normal.
Serial cardiac enzymes including troponin I were within
normal limits.  Swab of pretracheal fluid showed 4+ Gram
stain (over 10/1000 times field), positive polys.  Wound
culture was pending, and blood cultures were pending.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray on [**3-14**] showed a
possible left lower lobe pneumonia with a possible left
pleural effusion.

CT on [**3-15**] showed focal tracheal narrowing, soft tissue
density and piriform sinuses (right more than left), and a
patent airway.

A chest x-ray on [**3-16**] confirmed tracheal tube placement
and showed that there was no pneumothorax.

The patient had an I-131 scan on [**3-4**] which showed no
evidence of distant metastatic disease from thyroid cancer.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 74-year-old white male with
hypertension, history of congestive heart failure, multiple
malignancies with metastases (status post total thyroidectomy
on [**2194-1-29**]), an 8-day infection of thyroidectomy wound
(treated three days with dicloxacillin) who presented on
[**2194-3-15**] with worsening stridor, dyspnea, orthopnea,
lower extremity edema, chest pain, and purulent wound
discharge.

The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction per serial
enzymes (troponin I level was 0.3).  A CT of the neck showed
focally narrowed larynx and trachea, and the patient had open
tracheostomy performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2194-3-15**] with
placement of tracheal tube.

Postoperative treatment for infection was with cefazolin in
the Intensive Care Unit.  He was transferred to CC7 on
[**2194-3-16**] in stable condition, unable to speak.  The
patient has no right laryngeal nerve from surgery, and a
porotic left laryngeal nerve.  He was afebrile during his
stay on CC7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  STATUS POST TRACHEOSTOMY:  The procedure was performed by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]; tracheostomy was in place producing active
secretions of clear appearance.  Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 18353**]
recommendations, the patient was suctioned every two hours
until secretions decreased, and special care was taken of
tracheal tube.  The patient was comfortable and had no
respiratory complaints.  Breath sounds were loud and coarse
with diffuse crackles, bilateral wheezes, and bilateral
rhonchi.

[**Name (NI) **]/Nose/Throat performed changes of iodoform packing daily
and took care of the tracheostomy ties.  The patient was
scoped on [**2194-3-18**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], and his initial
tracheostomy tube was switched to a fenestrated tube with a
cap.  The patient was subsequently able to speak.  Per
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], the wound had healed nicely.

For his lungs, the patient received Atrovent nebulizers and
was followed by Respiratory and Physical Therapy.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient has a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure.
His exercise test with MIBI in [**2193-10-26**] showed an
ejection fraction of 58%, and no perfusion abnormalities,
with 81% ma
