Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise, cough, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 47 M with DM1 s/p kidney/pancreas transplant
on chronic prednisone, HTN, CRI, who presented with a
non-productive cough, SOB, malaise, increase in LE edema, and
fever 100.1 starting [**12-28**].  The patient thought he may have
pneumonia and went to [**Hospital3 6592**] for assessment.  At [**Hospital1 **],
his Cr 3.6 from baseline Cr 2.0.  WBC 16.4 with Bands 5.  CK
389, MB 24, MBI 6.6, TropT 7.84, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 26568**].  An EKG showed
evidence of an anterolateral STEMI, and patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] transplant surgery service
because of his previous kidney/pancreas transplant.  O2 sat was
99% RA.  He was given IVF 75/hr, which was stopped a few hours
later.  The Cards fellow requested transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3, and a
trigger was called on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for O2 sat 93% on nonrebreather.
He was given lasix 40 IV before transfer to CCU on monitoring.
.
In the CCU, EKG showed 1-2 mm STE V2-V6; Q waves V2-V5, I, AVL;
STE in AVR, AVL, suggesting an anterolateral STEMI and proximal
LAD infarct that occurred several days prior.  CK 267, MB 17,
Trop 6.19.  In the early am, the case was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] (interventional attending) who did not wish to take
patient to the cath lab immediately.  The patient was found to
have a systolic murmur.  No valvular pathology was noted on
previous TEE (normal EF with normal wall motion).  A bedside TTE
was performed to assess mechanical complication of STEMI.  TTE
showed EF 30%, 1+MR, mid anterior wall and apex akinetic, no
thrombus.

Past Medical History:
DM1 x 12 yo
R toe amputation
Osteopenia
Urethral stricture
Penile implant
Sleep apnea history
Kidney/pancreas transplant [**2183**]:
His kidney transplant is present in his RLQ, pancreas transplant
is in his LLQ (enteric conversion was performed where pancreas
was moved from bladder to GI).  He had one rejection episode in
[**2183**], but transplant has generally taken well on prednisone and
prograf.  Since the pancreas transplant, the patient has not
required any insulin since [**2183**], and he does not need to check
his blood glucose at home.  He has been completely compliant
with his medications, and has not been taking ASA.

Social History:
No ETOH, 20 pky smoker, quit [**2183**] before transplant, smokes
marijuana rarely, no heroin, no cocaine. Married with 2
children, works for [**Company 11293**].

comfortable
HEENT: JVD to 8 cm, no LAD, PERRL, no carotid bruits
LUNGS: Rales 1/2way up both lungs
HEART: 3/6 systolic murmur increasing on inspiration, [**4-17**]
systolic murmur radiating to axilla, no r/g, no S3, no S4
ABDOMEN: Kidney transplant in RLQ, Pancreas transplant in LLQ,
+BS, soft, nonobese, ND NT
NEURO: [**6-16**] motor, CN 2-12 intact

CXR: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to the most
recent prior chest radiograph, [**2195-6-1**]:

There is a severe interstitial pulmonary abnormality
predominantly in the lower lungs with some coalescence in the
right middle and lower lobes accompanied by small bilateral
pleural effusions. This could be due to pulmonary edema except
that the heart is normal size and there is no mediastinal,
pulmonary or hilar vascular engorgement. Alternative
explanations are acute interstitial pneumonia or acute
myocardial infarction.
.
TTE: Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with  severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the distal half of
the septum and anterior walls and distal inferior and lateral
walls. The apex is akinetic and mildly  aneurysmal. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right  ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
stenosis (AoVA =  0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are  mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular  inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left  atrial pressure. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD (mid-LAD territory).  Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
Adenosine MIBI: IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate, predominantly fixed
perfusion defect involving the mid-distal anterior wall, the
apex, and the distal septum. 2. Marked left ventricular
enlargement. 3. Severe global hypokinesis, with superimposed
apical dyskinesis. LVEF=18%.
.
Adenosine MIBI:
SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
mg/kg/min.

METHOD:

Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Tracer was
injected approximately one hour prior to obtaining the resting
images.
Two minutes after the cessation of infusion of dipyridamole,
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc99m sestamibi
was administered IV. Stress images were obtained approximately
one hour following tracer injection.
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate.
Left ventricular cavity size is markedly enlarged.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform moderate,
predominantly fixed perfusion defect involving the mid-distal
anterior wall, the apex, and the distal septum.
Gated images reveal severe global hypokinesis, with superimposed
apical
dyskinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 18%.

IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate, predominantly fixed perfusion defect
involving the
mid-distal anterior wall, the apex, and the distal septum. 2.
Marked left
ventricular enlargement. 3. Severe global hypokinesis, with
superimposed
apical dyskinesis. LVEF=18%.
.
[**1-5**] CXR: CHEST: Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray
of [**1-4**]. The perihilar interstitial opacities, most
marked in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe are again
seen. This pattern of interstitial infiltrate would be unusual
and prolonged for simple failure and I suspect the presence of
pneumonia in addition. The size of the effusions has decreased
consistent with improved failure, but I doubt the infiltrates
are caused by this.
IMPRESSION: Persistent perihilar infiltrates, pneumonia is
suspected.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 47 M with DM1, kidney/pancreas transplant [**2183**], HTN,
CRI, who is here s/p anterolateral STEMI, presenting with
shortness of breath which is likely attributed to a CHF
exacerbation.
