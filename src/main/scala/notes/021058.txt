Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this Admission


History of Present Illness:
80 y/o M with history of a-fib on coumadin presents to OSH
s/p unwitnessed fall today at rehab facility. He states that he
does not recall the event, the last thing he remembers is waking
up with people surrounding him. He reports episodes of dizziness
for the past couple of weeks and a mild headache, but denies any
blurred vision, neck tenderness, nausea, or vomiting. He was
transported to OSH where a head CT was performed revealing R
temporal contusion. INR was 2.5 at OSH and was reversed with Vit
K and FFP. Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
neurosurgical workup.


Past Medical History:

vertigo, adenoidectomy, CAD w/ stent placement x 5, hernia
repair, tonsillectomy, TURP, PNA x 2 in past 6 weeks, diabetic
neuropathy, community acquired MRSA, orbital blowout.


Social History:
Previous smoker, quit years ago, [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from a rehab facility

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Upon Discharge:
Alert and oriented x 3. PERRL. EOMs intact.
Face symmetric, tongue midline.
No pronator drift.
Full strength and sensation in all extremities.
Bilateral pedal edema.
Patient is oxygen dependent and desaturates when sleeping.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2179-12-25**]: Right temporal SAH. No edema, mass effect or
midline shift.

ECHO [**2179-12-27**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. There is trace aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
Is there a history to suggest a primary pulmonary process (e.g.,
pulmonary embolism).

Carotid Series Complete [**2179-12-27**]:
Impression: Right ICA stenosis 40-59% (low end).
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
Resistive, almost to-fro right vertebral artery flow conistent
with more distal stenosis or occlusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted after sustaining a fall and was found
to have a right temporal SAH. He had been on aspirin, plavix,
and coumadin and due to his high risk of increase in hemorrhage
he was admitted to the ICU for Q1 hour neuro checks. The patient
was given FFP and vitamin K to reverse his INR. He was evaluated
by trauma who did not feel there were any other injuries. He had
xrays of the right scapula, right ankle, and hips which showed
no fractures but there was degenerative disease present. The
patient was transferred out of the ICU to the neuro step down
unit on [**12-26**] because his neuro exam was stable and his head CT
was stable as well. His aspirin was restarted that day.

The patient underwent a sycope work-up because his fall was
unwitnessed and he reportedly had a brief LOC. His Echo showed a
normal EF with mild mitral regurgitation and pulmonary
hypertension and his carotid ultrasound revealed mild stenosis
bilaterally. His cardiac enzymes were not elevated. He did not
have chest pain during his hospital course.

Mr. [**Known lastname 39713**] did require oxygen during his hospital course and this
is consistent with his needs at rehab prior to admission. When
he sleeps his oxygen requirement increases.

On [**12-28**] the patient was transferred out of the step down unit to
floor status for Q4 neuro checks because he was neurologically
stable. He was evaluated by PT and OT who felt that he was safe
to go back to rehab. Overnight he required one dose of IV
Lopressor for tachycardia to the 170s. He responded well to
this. Additionally, his medication regimen was adjusted so that
his cardiac medications were given in the morning rather than at
night. His insulin was adjusted due to high blood glucose
levels. On [**12-29**] his heart rate and glucose had improved. He was
discharged to the facility where he was at previously on [**2179-12-29**].
