Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
62 yo M w/ longstanding history of COPD p/w respiratory distress
today from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Per ED notes and family, pt c/o
increased SOB x 4d, worse today, w/ cough productive of
yellow/green sputum. He is on vanc/meropenem to complete a 4
week course due to end on [**7-27**].
.
Pt has had recent long course of hospitalizations beginning in
[**3-18**] with PNA; no pathogen was identified and he received an
empiric 4 week course of levofloxacin, after which he improved
to his baseline and returned to work.
.
In late [**Month (only) 547**] he relapsed with cough and shortness of breath; he

was admitted [**Date range (1) 65562**]. Sputum cultures including routine cx,
legionella cx, PCP staining were again not diagnostic and he was
treated with empiric vanc/zosyn for 4 weeks.
.
On admission in [**Month (only) **], from [**Date range (1) 65563**] a CT scan demonstrated a
large LUL bulla with fluid level, left lingular pneumonia and L
pleural effusion. Sputum cultures failed to identify pathogen.
He was initiated on a steroid taper and empiric vanc/meropenem,
and his clinical status improved. After several days his WBC
count rose to 21k and repeat imaging demonstrating new RLL
aspiration pneumonia.
Discussion was held re interventional procedure to tap L chest
and/or to have CT surgery perform bullectomy, though it was felt

at the time that the risks of these procedures outweighed the
benefits. Conservative management with antibiotics was planned.

.
He had a repeat CT [**7-15**] which showed slightly decreased fluid in
the LUL bulla. He was just seen [**7-17**] in [**Hospital **] clinic and no change
was made to his course of abx.
.
In the ED it was thought he had a COPD flare vs. PNA. He was not
given further abx or steroids, but was given a combivent neb. He
was also given ativan, after which time he became somnolent but
in the ED was recorded as "resting comfortably". On arrival to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was unarousable; his ABG was 7.03/156/68. He was
intubated, and became responsive within an hour.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M w/ severe COPD and necrotizing PNA/empyema in LUL bulla
on several months of abx since [**3-18**] p/w respiratory failure.
Brief hospital course as follows:
.
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Very elevated PCO2
initially, likely acute on chronic from somnolence [**2-15**] ativan,
nonrebreather O2 in ED, as he is a CO2 retainer. Last (6:30am on
[**7-28**]) was 7.37/69/96.  Goal O2 sats were in low 90%s, PCO2 50-60
to help drive down alveolar ventilation needed for extubation.
Extubated per patient and family's expressed wishes and [**Month/Year (2) 3225**] per
patient and family.
.
2) PNA: Difficult to clear infected organisms from loculated
bulla. Likely had anaerobes which are not well grown from
routine suptum culture. Not able to drain fluid as any needle
introduction will give PTX and track through pleural space.
Stopped abx as pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].
.
3) COPD: Probably contributed to hypoxia.
.
4) Anemia: Last Hct was 29.8 (was 35.1 on [**2176-7-3**])
.
5) UE edema: Improved but presumed to be secondary to aggressive
fluid recuscitation. Monitored edema/chest exam and gave lasix
as appropriate before becoming [**Date Range 3225**].
.

On [**2176-7-28**], pt and family expressed wish to extubate patient and
make him [**Date Range 3225**]. Patient expired in the late afternoon on [**2176-7-28**].
