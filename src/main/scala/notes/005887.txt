History of Present Illness:
47 yo M with EtOH/hep C cirrhosis, HTN, DM who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] for liver transplant evaluation and
management of Hepatorenal syndrome.

Patient has a 10yrs of HCV (never tx and no bx, genotype 3a) and
EtOH hepatitis and cirrhosis.  His initial decompensation
appears to have occured in [**2194-1-25**] with ascites, edema and
deconditioning.  Reportedly he quit EtOH use at that time.  He
was seen at the [**Doctor Last Name **] state Liver transplant center in may with
w/up including EGD with Grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy,
CT abd/pelvis ([**10-6**]) with hepatosplenomgealy w/o lesions, RML
nodule in the lung and large ascites.  He has never had a
variceal bleed.  He has been undergoing biweekly paracenteses
since spring [**2194**], however there is no documentation of diuretic
refractory ascites.  He did have grade 2 HE and had no hx of
HRS, HPS or HCC.  His labs at time of that evaluation were
notable for Cr of 0.9, INR 1.1 and Bili of 0.9.   Fe studies
were notabel for ferritin of 621, FeSat 49% and Fe 86. MELD was
7 and CPS 10.  He was initially seen at [**Doctor Last Name **] state in [**Month (only) 116**] and
then in [**Month (only) **], when majority of the work up was initiated.
Of note he did not complete further evaluation as he moved to MA
to be with his son 1 mo ago.
.
Patient was in USOH with recurrent ascites, non-encephalopathic
until ~ 2 wks ago when he developed increasing abdominal
distension and pain.
.
per NF note: "The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **]
on [**2194-12-21**] with 2 weeks of malaise, body aches, chills, poor PO
intake, non-bloody diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal
discomfort, dysuria, and jaundice. No sick contacts. Traveled to
[**Male First Name (un) 1056**] 3 months ago.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], exam was notable for jaundice and ascites.
Admission labs showed WBC 8.8 (8% bands), Hct 33.7, Plt 136, Na
126, Cr 2.1 (up from normal on [**2194-12-2**]), albumin 2.0, ALT 53,
AST 61, alkphos 314, Tbili 18.9 (up from 1.9 on [**2194-12-2**]), Dbili
14.3, lipase 249, INR 1.5. Urine sodium was 23. FENA 0.3%.
Abdominal ultrasound showed normal portal and hepatic venous
flow, moderate ascites, splenomegaly, no biliary dilatation, no
stones or hydronephrosis."
.
His UA was positive with nitrates, but Cx was negative. He
received ketorolac for pain at [**Hospital3 **] ED.
.
"Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis was performed, with WBC
50, 4% polyps. A total of 7.5 L of fluid was removed. The
admission (written prior to the paracentesis) suggests empiric
ertapenem for SBP, but it is unclear from the available records
if this was given.  Quinapril was stopped. and the patient was
challenged with fluids and albumin. Midodrine and octeotide were
started. Renal was consulted and recommend transfer to [**Location (un) 86**]
for transplant evaluation.
.
On transfer, BUN was 35, creatinine 3.1, tbili 22.3, dbili 16.8,
INR 1.6. Urine output during the 24 hours prior to transfer was
200 cc."
.
On the floor, patient appeared to be encephalopathic and had no
complaints other then pain at the site of the foley catheter.
Above history was also confirmed with his son, [**Name (NI) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
47 y.o. male with h/o EtOH abuse/hep C cirrhosis (see above for
detailed history), HTN, poorly controlled DM who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] for transplant evaluation in the setting of
markedly worsening hepatic and renal function, and concern for
hepatorenal syndrome. Meld was 34. Admission labs revealed VRE
UTI.
He completed a course of Linezolid. Liver function worsened with
sequelae. Meld score increased to 40s. Lactulose and Rifaximin
were started for hepatic encephalopathy. Frequent therapeutic
paracentesis were needed for refractory ascites. Liver
transplantation was pursued with subsequent workup.  He agreed
to participate in substance abuse relapse programs and his son
agreed to be his advocate and care giver. Pre transplant workup
was completed and approved.

As an outpatient he was given diagnosis of HRS as renal function
worsened in setting of receiving Toradol,and volume depletion
post large volume paracentesis. Renal US was unrevealing for
abnormalities. Nephrology was consulted. Etiology for [**Last Name (un) **] was
likely pre-renal and some component of ATN in the setting of
worsening liver failure.  Octreotide/midodrine were started, but
were discontinued as there was no improvement. Hemodialysis was
initiated. Nephrology deemed him a suitable candidate for
combined liver kidney transplant.

He had a lower GI bleed requiring blood products and transfer to
SICU. EGD on [**1-7**] showing severe gastropathy, previously banded
varices were not actively bleeding. Colonoscopy showed 4 cords
of small rectal varices that were not bleeding. Ulceration,
friability, erythema and mosaic appearance from 50 cms until
Cecum were compatible with portal colonopathy which seemed to be
bleeding spontaneously from low platelets and elevated I
