Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
b/l saddle pulmonary embolism

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
73 yo with h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia presented to [**Hospital **]
hospital with sudden onset of pain b/w shoulder blades at 11AM,
while walking from car to house. He felt as though he would pass
out but made it inside. He suddenly lost consciousness without
warning signs or symptoms, falling to the ground and hitting
head on floor (carpet). Pt thinks he had LOC for 20 min. When he
awoke, he felt he was breathing rapidly. He took 2 baby aspirin
and waited about 1.5 hours until his wife came home and brought
[**Last Name (un) **] to the OSH. At [**Hospital1 **], he was found to have large
bilateral main pulmonary emboli, as well as right popliteal DVT.
A CT head was negative for bleed. He was given IVFs, 100mg of
Lovenox , ASA 325, and 5mg of Coumadin at 3PM. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
He denies any recent travel (did travel by airplane to Novia
Scotia in [**Month (only) 216**]). No family or personal h/o DVT or PE. He had a
colonoscopy 2 yrs ago which was unremarkable and states his PCP
likely checks his PSA regularly.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 98.3, HR 74, BP 171/82, RR 22, 100% 2L. Labs
revealed a creatinine of 1.4 (baseline unknown) and TropT 0.17.
He was admitted to the MICU on [**12-25**] where he was put on a
heparin drip w/ bridge to coumadin. His INR on admission was 1.1
and on transfer was 1.3. During this time his Troponins trended
down 0.17 -> 0.11 -> 0.05. He was hemodynamically stable and
transferred to [**Wardname 27095**].
.

Hyperlipidemia

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y.o. man with sudden onset back pain and LOC. Found to have
b/l main pulmonary artery PEs and R popliteal DVT.
.
# Pulmonary embolism - OSH PECT indicated bilateral main
pulmonary artery emboli. Pt lost consciousness indicating some
hemodynamic instability, but has had normal vital signs since.
OSH head CT indicated no evidence of acute hemorrage or
cerebrovascular changes.  Troponin leak on admission indicated
heart strain (as evidence on admission EKG) or ischemia and is
correlated w/ worsened prognosis. His troponin trended down over
time and there was no evidence of STEMI on repeat EKG [**12-26**].
Patient was put on heparin gtt scale for a coumadin bridge.
.
In investigating source of clot, it may be possible that
sustained time sitting may be responsible but there is no
obvious source; in context of no recent immobility or travel,
must consider two other arms of Virchow's triad: endothelial
damage and hypercoagulable state. Patient has no history of
smoking or DM, although he does have a h/o HTN and
hyperlipidemia which may have contributed to endothelial damage.
Patient had normal colonoscopy 2 yrs ago; will hold off checking
PSA to look for Trousseau's syndrome. The question of whether Mr
[**Known lastname 76191**] has a hypercoagulable state, whether genetic or acquired,
can be worked up as outpatient. Given slow increase in INR,
patient was discharged with lovenox 100 q12H with sufficient
quantity to get him to his PCP appointment on the following
Wednesday after his Friday discharge.
.
# DVT - R popliteal DVT found at outside hospital. Denies travel
or family hx of thromboembolic disease. Anticoagulation as above
and no need for repeat LENIs or IVC filter unless fails
anticoagulation.
.
# Renal failure- Creatinine 1.4 on admission, was 1.3 at outside
hospital. Unknown baseline. Pt. did get CTA with dye load at
OSH. Urine lytes were drawn and FeNA = 0.008% and BUN/Cre = 28
indicating prerenal state. This was likely due to a combination
of IV contrast given at OSH and dehydration. Creatinine came
down to 1.1 by the day of discharge.
.
# Hypertension - BP @ basline hypertension 150s/80s. Will
restart home HTN HCTZ, but held lisinopril for concern about
renal function. Will not use BBlockers as baseline HR is 40-60
(apparently has long h/o this per patient and is consistently
asymptomatic). On discharge, given hypertension in the hospital
and normal renal function, his home dose of lisinopril was
restarted.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - continue lipitor at home dose
.
# Hyperglycemia: FSBG 134-174. HBA1c is 5.8 indicating no
evidence of hyperglycemia. Getting RISS and FSBG QID in MICU and
O/N on floor. In AM FSBG well controlled 113,107, no h/o
diabetes, and no evidence of current glucose intolerance.
Elevated BG likely due to acute stress secondary to PE and D5W
that heparin drip was administered in. His RISS and QID
fingersticks were discontinued.
.
# MAINTENANCE
FEN - Cardiac diet
Prophylaxis- heparin gtt, bowel regimen, restart ASA 81.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
pulmonary embolism
deep vein thrombosis
.
Secondary Diagnosis:
hypertension
hyperlipidemia

Discharge Condition:
good

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hosptial for a pulmonary embolism and
deep vein thrombosis.
.
You were treated with anticoagulants and were discharged once it
became evident that your pulmonary and cardiovascular status had
improved.
.
We incidentally found that your creatinine, a measure of renal
function, was elevated on routine labs, suggesting somewhat
decreased kidney function. This returned to [**Location 213**] by the time
of your discharge. This likely does not reflect an ongoing
problem but it's something that you and your doctor can check on
from time to time. If your urine becomes foamy, bloody, brown,
or you start having much more or much less urine, let your
doctor know.
