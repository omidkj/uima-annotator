Allergies:
Demerol / Vicodin / Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
S/P Fall with multiple fx

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R humerus closed reduction
R humerus ORIF


History of Present Illness:
71 M c CAD/CHF, AICD c BiV pacer, Afib on coumadin, DM on
insulin who presents after a mechanical fall onto R side.
History from wife who is at patient's bedside; pt. somnolent.
Pt. squatting to feed cat and on rising had mechanical fall with
twisting motion onto R side. Unwitnessed. Denies LOC. Wife found
patient down complaining of pain at R shoulder and R hip. Also
denies any preceding CP, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness,
palpitations, bowel/bladder incontinence.
.
Presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] ED and found to have R transverse humeral
neck fracture and R acetabular fracture and pubic ramus
fracture. Transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In ED, VSS and AF. Seen by ortho; closed reduction performed on
R humeral fracture and felt to require ORIF for acetabular
fracture. Recommended hold on all anti-coagulation. Pain well
controlled with IV Dilaudid 1 mg * 2 though pt. somewhat
somnolent. Noted to have Cr 2.5 in ED; baseline is unknown.
.
Per conversation today with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 3314**], (OSH records
pending), pt is CRF with baseline creat 2.5-2.7. Per
conversation, PCP has old notes that indicate baseline O2 sats
in high 80s - low 90s. Pt had angiograms of legs recently by
vascular which worsened his renal function (now returned to
baseline CRF).
.
ROS: No recent orthopnea, PND, urinary problems. Wife does
report two recent hospitalizations; first at [**Hospital3 417**] for
lower extremity pain thought [**12-30**] PVD. Pt. underwent angiography
c intervention as per wife with some relief of symptoms. Second
at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital 1 week prior for lower extremity pain and
SOB; found to have O2 sat 84% RA; thought [**12-30**] URI and pt.
treated with a prednisone taper; however, pt. lacks a formal
diagnosis of COPD. Wife mentions that pt's potassium level was
high on that admission but unclear etiology of this. Normally
the patient is able to walk about 50 feet across his ranch
house, prepares his own meals, dresses himself, and occasionally
drives.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 y/o M h/o CAD, CHF (EF 25-30%), Severe TR, AICD w/ [**Hospital1 **]-V
pacer, DM2, chronic renal failure, who presents with right hip
and humerus fractures, MICU callout for respiratory failure [**12-30**]
nosocomial pneumonia and volume overload. Now respiratory status
is stable on nasal cannula.  s/p R humerus ORIF.  R hip not
repaired given surgical risks. Pt was made CMO and passed away

.
# Hypoxia: combination of vol overload and aspiration PNA> for
the vol overload the pt was diuresed with torsemide and lasix.
he aspirated twice leading to desatt and tranfer to ICU. he was
weaned down to O2 by NC and transferred back to the floor. he
was treated with vanco nad aztreonam (zosyn was d/c'ed because
of the concern for AIN). also received nebs.
.
# Systolic/Diastolic Heart Failure: TTE on [**2197-2-20**] showed EF
25-30%, also w/ 4+ TR. SvO2 54%. Clinically volume overload.
continued carvedilol 25mg po bid. planned to start ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] once
ARF resolves. had a BIV pacer and AICD
.
# Fractures:  s/p humerus ORIF.  Surgical repair of R hip
fracture was on hold given surgical risk. OOB to chair, NWB R
arm and RLE.  continued PT
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr rose from 2.4. Thought
initially to be [**12-30**] diuresis however creatinine continued to
rise despite holding diuresis. FeNa 0.67% indicating a prerenal
process also +urine eos indicated AIN. AIN most likely [**12-30**] zosyn
and changed to aztreonam. Renally dosed meds and antibiotics.
held ACE in setting of ARF
.
# CAD: No evidence for active CAD. S/p CABG in [**2184**]. continued
beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]. held ACE in setting of [**Doctor First Name 48**]. EP interrogated

# Afib: Currently paced; unknown what current underlying rhythm
is.  Continue anticoagulation with coumadin. held digoxin in
setting of ARF
.
# PVD: was on pentoxiphylline. vascular saw the pt and did not
feel that there was an acute need for an invasive procedure. pt
was to f/u with his outpt vascular surgeon
