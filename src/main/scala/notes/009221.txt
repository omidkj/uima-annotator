Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Weak/Lethargic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 yoF w/ a h/o ESRD secondary to HTN and DM,
failed renal tx (primary graft non function), and recent
admission for staph epi bactermia thought to be related to an HD
catheter infection presented initally to the ER at [**Hospital 6451**] with R sided weakness and blurred vision, the patient
was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER after a Head CT without
bleed.
.
Per the family her bilateral blurred vision started the day
prior to her admission, she said this improved with glasses.
Then the day of admission she began to feel as though her vision
was "enclosed in glass" and she began to have abnormal speech
and tongue swelling, she had some R sided weakness and was at
that time her home health aide called 911.   EMS reported the
patient had slurred speech.  The patient had recently started an
albuterol inhaler this a.m.
.
In the ED, initial VS:  T 97.9 HR 60  BP 85/40 RR 12 O2 sat:
90's. In the ER she was noted to be hypotensive, anasarca with
facial / tongue / arm swelling.  She was noted to be
intermittently hypoxic without a good pleth.  Neuro was
consulted and thought a stroke versus septic emboli was
possible.  Neuro recommended an LP and then anticoagulation for
her possible intracardiac thrombus.  A femoral line was placed
in the ER.  She was started on a bicarb drip for metabolic
acidosis  She rec'd benadryl 50mg IV, famotidine 20mg,
solumedrol 125mg x 1 IV, epi pen, Calcium gluconate, vancomycin
1g, zosyn.  The patient was intubated.  She rec'd 1 L NS.
.
She was intubated mainly for airway protection. (and unable to
get good pleth).  HR 51, BP 92/66,  93% FiO2 400x20, PEEP 10.
On levophed 0.1 and propofol.


Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
- Stage V CKD secondary to hypertension/diabetes and was HD
dependent (R sided indwelling line) s/p cadaveric renal
transplant [**2144-8-15**] c/b delayed graft function and wound infection

- Diabetes type II
- Depression
- multiple DVT
- Atrial fibrillation in setting of parathyroidectomy.
- Coag negative staph bacteremia during [**3-/2145**] admission in
which HD line was removed and replaced, which then needed to be
replace and found to be Pseudomonas positive cath tip. Tx'd with
one month Vancomycin and Ceftazadime. Seen to have clot at
junction of RA and SVC, Cardiac surgery recommended completing
antibiotics course.
.

.
[**2145-5-4**] CT head:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or process.
2. Interval partial opacification of the ethmoid air cells and
mild mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses. Stable partial
opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
.
[**2145-5-4**] CT TORSO:
1. No definite evidence of thrombus within the SVC. Lower SVC is
still
probably slightly narrowed as seen on the recent angiography
study of [**2145-4-1**]. Evaluation is somewhat limited due
to cardiac motion and presence of central venous line through
the SVC. The azygos vein remains mildly dilated as seen on the
previous study.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
The
right-sided pleural effusion has increased in size since
previous study and the left-sided pleural effusion has decreased
in size. There is bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Small amount of free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.
Three large
calcified gallstones noted within the gallbladder with
pericholecystic fluid. Findings are likely due to third spacing,
but in the appropriate clinical setting, cholecystitis is not
excluded. Further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed
for further evaluation.
4. Normally enhancing renal transplant within the pelvis.
5. Severe wedge compression fracture of L1, stable since
[**45**]/[**2144**].
.
[**2145-5-4**] Unilateral LE U/S:Extremely limited exam due to diffuse
edema and body habitus. Distal left superficial femoral vein not
imaged in addition to the calf veins. However, no evidence of
DVT within the visualized veins.
.
[**2145-5-5**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and

disorganization of the background rhythm. No areas of focal
slowing,
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures were seen
during this
recording.
.
[**2145-5-6**] MRI brain: 1. There is no evidence of large acute
infarction, mass effect, or hemorrhage. A tiny focus of
increased DWI signal in the right medial temporal lobe which may
represent an artifact or less likely a very tiny acute infarct.
Attention on follow up can be considered.
2. The right posterior inferior cerebellar artery is not
visualized. This
might be secondary to its small caliber less likely disease
process. CTA can be considered if there is clinical concern. 3.
Unchanged opacification of the mastoid air cells bilaterally.
This is nonspecific but can be seen in mastoiditis. Please
correlate clinically.

.
[**2145-5-5**] ECHO: There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation is probably
moderate but was not fully assessed. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation is
present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. A catheter is seen in the right
atrium. There is a small mobile echodense structure (~0.4x1.0
cm) near the junction of the SVC and right atrium (see cell 28)
that may be adherent to catheter. This structure is in the same
vicinity as echodense structures seen in the prior study of
[**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is
limited.
.
[**2145-5-5**] RUQ U/S: Cannot assess for acute cholecystitis given
limitations and inability to asses for son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**]
sign. Cholelithiasis and similar appearance of gallbladder as
seen on recent CT. Small right pleural effusion.
