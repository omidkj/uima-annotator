History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old male with history of mental
retardation, [**Known lastname **] (see below), who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from his
adult day care center yesterday after having increasing dyspnea
and wheezing despite increased nebulizer use. Patient also noted
to have non-productive cough, no other URI symptoms. No
headache, myalgias, no known fevers at home. No known sick
contacts, but attends day program.
.
In ER, patient was uable to perform peak flow, and was given
continuous nebs, then peak flow=120. Was also febrile to T101.2
and tahcycardiac to 120-130's. O2 sats were in the 90's on nebs.
He was given heliox, Combivent, Solumedrol 125 mg, magnesium,
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin. He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He
was continued on continuous nebs overnight, and was started on
high dose steroids and an inhaled steroid as well. Antibiotics
were not felt to be warranted at this time. Patient was also
ruled out for flu.
.
Patient currently is c/o increased cough, non productive. Feels
that breathing has improved since admission, but is not at
baseline. Denies F/C/N/V, no chest pain or pleuritic pain. Per
family, patient has been using nebulizers at the day program up
to 3 times per day whether he needs them or not. Feel that
patient has been worse ever since going out in the cold Friday
night, ? trigger. Family also concerned b/c they feel patient
has lost significant amount of weight over this past year.

Physical Exam:
GEN: NAD, lying in bed, awake, alert. Thin, with temporal
wasting and interosseus muscles

dentition

no crackles, no conversational dyspnea
HEART: RRR, S1/S2 normal, no murmur

SKIN: diaphoretic, some excoriations and eczema on LE
EXT: multiple excoriated and eczematous areas on both lower
extremities. trace edema B/L. No clubbing, full DP pulses B/L
NEURO: CN II-XII intact no focal deficits, AAO x 3, appropriate
affect


Pertinent Results:
admission CXR: increased right pulmonary artery and opacity of
the left lung vascularity - findings which may represent
pulmonary emboli.
No evidence of congestive heart failure or pleural effusion.
.
CTA OF THE CHEST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels
appear unremarkable. Note is made of coronary artery
calcifications. No filling defects are identified within the
central or segmental pulmonary arteries to suggest embolism.
There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is complete collapse of the right middle lobe and total
opacification of the right middle lobe bronchus. The remaining
lung demonstrates stable scarring at the apices bilaterally. No
lung nodules or masses are identified. There is thickening of
the bronchial walls, most notably in the lower lobes
bilaterally, which appears slightly worse than on the prior CT
from [**2189**].
The osseous structures demonstrate degenerative changes of the
spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Complete right middle lobe collapse. Bronchoscopy is
suggested to evaluate for obstructing endoluminal lesion.
2. Thickening of the bronchial walls, most notably in the lower
lobe is slightly worse since [**2189**] and is consistent with chronic
airway inflammation.
3. No evidence of central or segmental pulmonary emboli.
.
Compared to the film from the prior day, there has been no
significant interval change. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouette is normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The
right middle lobe collapse is better visualized on the lateral
view. Again seen is blunting of the right costophrenic angle.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in right middle lobe collapse.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo with h/o MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after
presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of mild to
moderate [**Hospital Unit Name **] exacerbation.  While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient
improved with 24 hours of continuous nebulizers and IV steroid.
No intubation was required, no antibiotics were started.  His
hospital course is discussed by problem.
.
# [**Hospital Unit Name **]: The exact trigger for his exacerbation was unclear,
possibly cold exposure w/ viral infection vs. poor medication
compliance with control meds, as patient had not been taking his
inhaled steroid on a regular basis, but rather relying solely on
nebulizers multiple times throughout the day (administered at
the group home).  He was ruled out for influenza, and although
her was febrile initially, he remained afebrile for the
remainder of his hospitalization.  He was continued on high dose
oral steroids with a slow taper.  His PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6431**], was
[**Name (NI) 653**], and explained the patient was supposed to be on 10mg
of prednisone daily.  He was provided with standing albuterol
and Atrovent nebulizers.  Although his oxygen saturation
remained stable, the patient persistently complained of
difficulty breathing on a daily basis.  A chest CTA was done
given the findings of the initial CXR, and although PE was ruled
out, the patient was found to have a RML collapse from most
likely a mucous plug.  The patient was provided with a flutter
valve, expectorants, fluid hydration, and chest PT to help clear
the plug.  The pulmonary service was [**Name (NI) 653**] and felt that
bronchoscopy would be unnecessary given his hemodynamic
stability, and to increased his inhaled steroid in addition to
the afore mentioned measures.  The patient's lung exam continued
to improve despite no interval change by CXR.  The patient was
eventually weaned off oxygen and remained stable at rest and
with ambulation.  It was suspected that his complaints of
dyspnea may have been associated with anxiety as well, as the
patient appeared quite comfortable when watched from afar, but
appeared anxious while being interviewed/ examined.  On the day
of discharge, the pulm service suggested pursuing a
bronchoscopy, but it was felt that this may cause the patient
more harm than benefit at this time given the stability of his
oxygen requirements and his improvement on exam and by symptoms.
 The patient was scheduled with an earlier appointment to see
his PCP within two weeks of discharge, and will need a follow-up
