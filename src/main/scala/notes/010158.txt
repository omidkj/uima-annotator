Admission Date:  [**2163-11-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-11-30**]

Date of Birth:   [**2087-4-9**]     Sex:  F

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain; status post cardiac arrest
during cardiac catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 76-year-old
hypertension, and extensive coronary artery disease history
grafts in [**2163-1-7**].

The patient was in her usual state of health until two day
prior to admission when, while shopping, she experienced
substernal chest pressure for 10 minutes with spontaneous
the day but resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin.  The pain
recurred one day prior to admission and again on the morning
dizziness and diaphoresis.  The pain resolved spontaneously
again, but the patient awoke again on the morning of
admission at 6 o'clock in the morning with chest pressure and
shortness of breath and proceeded to drive to the Emergency
Department.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have an
electrocardiogram with greater than 1-mm ST depressions in I
and aVL and V5 and V6 with questionable 0.5-mm ST elevations
in V4 and aVR.  All of these findings were while the patient
was pain free.  She was also noted to have a creatine kinase
of 716 and an increased MB, index, and troponin.  The patient
was given 5 mg p.o. intravenously Lopressor.  During her time in
the ED she developed progressive signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure.  She was taken to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory.

In the cardiac catheterization, the patient was noted to have
a pulmonary artery saturation of only 40%.  She was found to
have a saphenous vein graft (Y graft) to the diagonal and left
anterior descending artery which had a proximal 95% lesion.  Her
SVGs to RCA and OM were totally occluded.  The SVG to LAD/
diagonal was treated with PTCA/ stenting.  During the procedure,
the patient became bradycardic with heart rates in the 30s, and a
temporary pacing wire was placed.  She also developed respiratory
distress and hypotension.  At that point, the patient was
intubated, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and the
patient was started on Levophed and dopamine. The patient had a
short period of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter during this
episode.  An amiodarone drip was started, and the patient was
stabilized, and she was brought to the Cardiothoracic Intensive
Care Unit for further care.

Of note, the patient's decompensation in the cardiac
catheterization laboratory occurred in the context of
shooting dye into the single remaining patent vein graft to
the left anterior descending artery and diagonal.  When the
dye was shot into this vessel, the patient became hypotensive
and bradycardic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Coronary artery disease; status post percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty to the right coronary
artery in [**2155**].  Status post coronary artery bypass graft
times four with all venous grafts; no left internal mammary
artery was available, in [**2163-1-7**].  At that point,
she had the following catheterization findings:  A 70%
occluded left main, 90% occluded proximal left anterior
descending artery, first septal 80% occluded, first diagonal
was 80% occluded, proximal circumflex 99% occluded, second
obtuse marginal was 90% occluded, third obtuse marginal was
80% occluded, and the medial right coronary artery was 100%
occluded.  At that point, she also had an ejection fraction
of 26% and an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure of 27 mmHg.  The echocardiogram at that time also
found a hypokinetic anterolateral and inferior wall and
posterobasal wall.  She had a coronary artery bypass graft in
[**2162**] with the four grafts to the left anterior descending
artery, diagonal, obtuse marginal, and distal right coronary
artery.  As mentioned previously, all were venous grafts.
 2.  Hypertension.
 3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
 4.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital **] Clinic.
 5.  History of excessive smoking.
 6.  History of post operative atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular rate; status post cardioversion in the context of her
coronary artery bypass graft.
 7.  Chronic anemia.
 8.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
 9.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10.  Status post cholecystectomy.
11.  Status post hernia repair.
12.  History of E alloantibody with hemolytic reaction to
blood transfusions requiring E negative blood.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (The patient's home medication
included the following)
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 50 mg p.o. q.p.m.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lantus 22 units subcutaneously q.p.m.
8.  Humalog sliding-scale t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a widow.  She lives alone,
but her daughter is extremely involved in her life and able
to provide a great deal of assistance to her mother.  She has
a significant tobacco history; but she quit 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
upon arrival to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had the
following vital signs:  Temperature was 96.9, blood pressure
was 118/69, heart rate was 108 (at that time she was on
dopamine 15 mcg/kg per minute, Integrilin at 7.5 cc per hour,
and amiodarone 1 mg per minute).  She was ventilated at AC,
respiratory rate was 14, tidal volume was 600, and a positive
end-expiratory pressure of 7.5 on 80%.  She had a central
venous pressure at that time of 12 and pulmonary artery
pressure of 29/16.  Her gas on 100% oxygen was 7.25 was her
pH, 40 was her CO2, and 304 was her PAO2.  Physical
examination was as follows:  In general, intubated and
sedated with an intra-aortic balloon pump.  She had bilateral
femoral catheters.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed pupils were 4 mm and reactive.  The neck
was obese.  Cardiovascular examination revealed aortic
balloon sounds, but a regular rate and rhythm.  No extra
sounds.  Lungs revealed mechanical breath sounds bilaterally
and symmetric.  No wheezes or crackles.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
No masses.  Extremities revealed bilateral femoral catheters.
She was oozing at her right groin site.  She had 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.  She had trace edema bilaterally in
her lower extremities.  Neurologically, not responsive to
commands, but withdrew all four extremities to pain.  She had
upgoing toes bilaterally and intermittent fasciculations of
her left cheek and intermittent flexion of both arms.
