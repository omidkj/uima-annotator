Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 88582**]
Chief Complaint:
SVC Syndrome

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Stent placement in SVC
Stent placement in right mainstem bronchus


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o IBS and "irratic heart
rate," who presented to the IR suite today for elective SVC
stent placement.  The patient was reportedly in his normal state
of health until approximately [**Month (only) **], when he developed a
non-productive cough.  The cough worsened and he had occasional
blood flecked clear expectorate.  Three weeks ago, he then
developed RUE and facial swelling.  A CT performed at an OSH
revealed a large RUL mass with compression of the right mainstem
bronchi and SVC.  He was also noted to have a large pleural
effusion.  He was then seen on [**3-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was
scheduled for a SVC venogram with stenting prior to rigid
bronchoscopy tomorrow.  He thus presented today for SVC
stenting.
.
In the IR suite, he was given Fentanyl and Verset and the
obstructed SVC was stented with 3 stents (the first two were in
suboptimal position, so a third was placed).  Per report, the
patient then developed sinus tachycardia at the end of the
procedure, which was reportedly thought to be secondary to
either pain or dehydration.  There was concern because the
patient was in sinus tach at the end of the procedure.  He was
admitted overnight to medicine for observation until the rigid
bronchoscopy tomorrow morning.
.
On the floor, the patient immediately triggered for AFib with
RVR with rates to the 140s and stable BP.  He states that he has
a history of AFib, but he does not take any medication for it.
He was incredibly anxious and stated that he wanted to leave the
hospital and no longer wants the procedure tomorrow.  After
discussion with the patient and his wife, he agreed to take
medication for treatment of his anxiety but otherwise deferred
further medical management for his AFib.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: The patient is a 61 yo man with h/o AFib
who presented to the IP suite for SVC venogram and bronchoscopy
with right mainstem stent placement.
.
The obstructed SVC was stented with 3 stents; pt then developed
sinus tachycardia and was admitted to SIRS (medical floor) on
[**2165-3-14**] for observation until rigid bronchoscopy planned for the
next morning. Upon admission to SIRS, pt triggered for AFib with
RVR (HR 140s, BPs stable). He initially refused cardiac meds and
would only accept Ativan. Tachycardia subsequently resolved and
pt was taken for rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy on [**2165-3-15**]. Plan
was to stent right mainstem bronchus but this was not possible
given obstructive nature of tumor and its friability. Biopsy was
taken and sent for stat pathology.  Pt was intubated for the
procedure and extubated afterwards but became agitated and
hypoxic. Due to worsening hypercapnia and agitation, he was
re-intubated and transferred to MICU. He was re-extubated
without difficulty at the MICU. He did also have a troponin leak
that was believed to be [**1-23**] demand ischemia in setting of afib.
Plan initially was to have pt go home and return for XRT as
outpatient, particularly as pt reluctant to stay in hospital.
However, pt's HR was unstable and he was transferred to OMED for
further management and initiation of radiation. Final RLL lung
pathology pending at the time of discharge.
.
Pt was seen by radiation oncology and had XRT mapping as well as
his first session of XRT on [**2165-3-18**] prior to discharge. He did
have an episode of AF with RVR he morning prior to discharge,
which was managed with po metoprolol. He was also given Ativan
for anxiety, which was felt to be precipitating the rapid HR. He
will be discharged on 100mg of metoprolol succinate for rate
control.
.
Pt was confirmed full code this admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10010**],
It has been a pleasure taking care of you here at [**Hospital1 771**]. You were admitted to the hospital
because you have a mass in your lungs that is causing
compression on your right mainstem bronchus (the large airway).
While you were here, you underwent a stent placement in your
superior vena cava, one of the large veins returning blood to
the heart.  Furthermore, you had a ste
