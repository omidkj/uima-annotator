History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 104743**] is an 81 year old man with a history of PAF, PVD,
hypertension and MSSA endocarditis who presents from home with
mental status changes.  He was accompanied by his daughter who
stated that she had noticed the patient was increasingly
confused, and had subjective fevers.  He had a fall last night
without hitting head or loss of conciousness.  He also has been
having increased dyspnea on exertion that has progressed over
several weeks.  The patient has also had worsening lower
extremity edema.  Today, his legs have become warm, red and
tender.  He also has difficulty walking due to the pain.

He was diagnosed with MSSA endocarditis in [**3-5**] and he
finished a 6 week course of iv abx in mid [**Month (only) 958**]. He later had
MSSA grow out from his knee and had hardware there removed.  He
has no knee pain currently.

In the ED he was started on IV oxacillin.

CXR: Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions
and mild left lower lobe atelectasis. Cardiomegaly without
evidence for heart failure.

NCHCT: Stable appearance of the brain without evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect

LENIS: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower
extremity.

ECG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response
Loss of R waves in leads V1 and V2 consider old anteroseptal
infarct
Inferior/lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Repolarization changes may be partly due to rate/rhythm
No change from previous

ECHO: ([**11-16**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion subtending primarily the
inferior and posterior walls. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
collapse is seen.

Video Swallow: Mild-to-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia and
weakened oral phase, resulting in premature spillover and silent
aspiration of thin liquids.

ECHO ([**11-24**]):
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are  normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
2. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5. There is a moderate sized, circumferential, pericardial
effusion with
fibrin deposits on the surface of the heart. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
6. Compared with the findings of the prior report of [**2128-11-22**],
the pericardial effusion may be smaller.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pneumonia: Patient was initially admitted due to cellulitis
and delirium.  On hospital day # 3 patient became more agitated
and was noted to be hypoxic.  A new left lower lobe pneumonia
was found on CXR.  Given his poor mental status, aspiration was
presumed.  He was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxia,
hypotension , and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response.  His pneumonia was treated with Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole and subsquently Vancomycin as well (sputum grew
MSSA).  He required significant amount of supplemental oxygen,
however mechanical ventilation was avoided (he is DNR/DNI in any
case).  His mental status improved with treatment and his oxygen
was weaned.  He had a speech and swallow evalutaion which showed
a significant risk for further aspiration and so he was
maintained on thickened liquids, and pureed solids with
aspiration precautions at meal times.  He will require a repeat
evaluation as his mental status returns to normal.

2) Cellultitis: Given history of MSSA endocarditis, he was
initially started on Oxacillin for bilateral lower extemity
cellulitis.  His chronic lower extremity edema was felt to be
the risk factor for developing this infection.  His antibiotic
was changed to Vancomycin when he clinical course worsened.  An
attempt to change back to Oxacillin resulted in a worsening of
the cellulitis so he was changed to Vancomycin to complete a 14
day course.  He also had local wound care and his cellulitis
resolved nicely.

3) Atrial fibrillation: He has a history of PAF was was in
atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital course.  His rate
was difficult to control and was complicated by episodes of
hypotension.  He was tried on a sotalol drip and a diltiazem
drip, but these medications had to be stopped due to low blood
pressure.  Eventually he was loaded on digoxin with good effect.
 Metoprolol was started and titrated up and a heart rate of
80-90 bpm was achieved.  He may need further titration of his
lopressor dose for rate control.  He will need to have digoxin
levels checked if his renal function worsens in the future.  He
was maintained on coumadin and was supratherapeutic at time of
discharge.  He will need his coumadin restarted once his INR
drops to below 2.5.

4) Delirium: The patient was intermittently delirious throughout
his hospital stay.  It was felt to be due to his infections.
His mental status improved as his clinical status improved.  Low
dose Seroquel at bedtime and prn was utilized.  Wean off
psychotropic meds as mental status improves.

5) CHF: Patient likely has diastolic dysfunction worsened by
atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.  His echocardiogram
revealed a normal EF.  After his fluid resuscitation in the ICU,
he required
