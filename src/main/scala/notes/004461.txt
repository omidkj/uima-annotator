Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 yo woman with history of type II diabetes,
peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipid who
was recently admitted to CCU for respiratory distress in the
setting of decompensated heart failure and NSTEMI. She presented
to the ED last night from rehab less than 24 hours
post-discharge for increasing shortness of breath.

She says that she arrived at rehab yesterday afternoon feeling
generally well. She ate dinner after which she developed mild
abdominal discomfort that resolved spontaneously. She then felt
as if her heart was beating fast, and she also felt tired. There
was no chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or dizziness. She
says she was diaphoretic at the time. Her daughter, concerned,
called 911. En route to the hospital, she was noted to be
tachypnic and hypoxic (per ED report).

Initially in the ED she was hypoxic to mid 60s. She was also
hypertensive to 180s initially. EKG showed sinus tachycardia
with LAD (unchanged). Widened QRS (114 ms) with ST elevations in
anterior precordial leads (unchanged) and ST-depressions/T-wave
inversions in lateral leads (unchanged). CXR showed bilateral
perihilar consolidations worse from two days prior with
persistent pleural effusions; overall impression was worsening
pulmonary edema, although infection could not be excluded. ABG
showed 7.43/36/124. Lactate was 2.4. Labs were notable for white
count of 16.1 with 66.2% neutrophils and no bands. BMP showed a
bicarb of 21 with anion gap of 12. Renal function was normal. Of
note, her troponin was 2.63 (down from previous 6.41 on [**2-17**])
with flat CK. BNP was 14,871 (no prior for comparison). She was
placed on a nitro drip intially; this was quickly weaned off.
She was also placed on BiPAP intially. There were attempts made
to wean her to face mask or nasal cannula. However, per ED
report she became tachypnic to 30s with these measures, and
therefore she was readmitted to the CCU.

At time of admission, her sats were 95-96% on NRB, RR 27-32,
heart rate in the 90s with systolic BP 110s. In the ED she
received aspirin 325 mg x1, levofloxacin 750 mg x1, and Lasix 40
mg IV x1.

Of note, during her previous admission ([**2-15**] to [**2-21**]), she was
intubated for respiratory distress secondary to mitral
regurgitation which was believed secondary to ischemia. This all
had happened after an elective left total hip replacement at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**]. She underwent echocardiogram that showed a new
antero-apical wall motion abnormality and underwent cardiac cath
that revealed LAD disease for which a bare metal stent was
placed. She was started on Plavix and high-dose aspirin, as well
as Lovenox with bridge to coumadin for apical akinesis (LVEF
30-35%) noted on echocardiogram. She worked with physical
therapy for two days without chest pain or dyspnea and was felt
to be ready for discharge to rehab.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: currently, patient denies shortness of
breath, chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or dizziness.
She denies nausea, abdominal discomfort, cough, or sputum
production.

Past Medical History:
1) History of diabetes type II, although most recent HgA1c was
5.8 ([**2-/2170**]) off of all medications
2) Peripheral vascular disease: s/p left common femoral to below
knee popliteal artery bypass with in situ saphenous vein and an
open transluminal angioplasty of the anterior tibial and below
knee popliteal arteries in [**5-14**].
3) Hypertension
4) Hyperlipidemia
5) Hx of R breast ca s/p lumpectomy
6) Depression

Social History:
Originally she is from [**Country 3397**]. Prior to her discharge to rehab,
she lived at home with her husband and was independent in her
ADLs, IADLs and very functional. She denies history of smoking,
alcohol or drug abuse. Her daughter, who lives in [**Country 19828**], has
been recently staying in [**Location (un) 86**] and has been involved in her
care on a daily basis during her two recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**].

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 97.9, HR 93-94, BP 119-127/58-66), RR 12-20, sat
90-98% 5L
Urine output: 400 cc
General: elderly woman, generally anxious-appearing, lying
comfortably in bed, speaking in complete sentences without
pauses, no accessory muscle use or labored breathing
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRLA, EOMI
Neck: supple, no appreciable JVD
Chest: RRR, normal s1/s2, systolic murmur loudest along left
sternal border, radiating toward apex although not audible in
axilla
Lungs: crackles halfway up posterior fields
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds
Extremities: trace pitting edema to ankles bilaterally; feet
warm and well-perfused
Neurological: AAOx3, moving all extremities

At time of discharge, her oxygen saturations are in the mid to
high 90s on RA. Her blood pressures have been well-controlled
with systolic blood pressure ranging from 110 to 130. There is
no lower extremity pitting edema.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2170-2-19**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the distal halves of the anterior septum,
anterior and inferior walls as well as apex. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 30-35 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regur
