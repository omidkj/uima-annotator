Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
epistaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-1-4**] - Bilateral sphenopalatine and left descending palatine
artery embolization by Interventional Radiology
[**2199-1-2**] to [**2199-1-5**] - Intubation and mechanical ventilation
[**2199-1-5**] - Bronchoscopy
[**2199-1-11**] - Direct current electrical cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
This is a 68-year old Male with a PMH significant coronary
artery disease (s/p PCI with stenting of LAD, [**4-/2195**]), alcoholic
vs. infarct-related dilated cardiomyoatphy (EF 20-25%), s/p
biventricular [**Year (4 digits) 3941**] placement in [**6-/2195**], persistent atrial
fibrillation (s/p multiple cardioversions), h/o embolic renal
infarct ([**2-/2195**]) with prior left atrial appendage thrombus,
alcohol abuse who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with uncontrolled
left-sided posterior epistaxis and coagulopathy with INR of 5.2
requiring ENT consultation and Epistat packing. The bleeding
progressed to bilateral involvement and he was not clearing the
brisk [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was intubated for airway protection and a
right Epistat was placed by ENT. He received 2 units of FFP, but
had a stable HCT at the time. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management; vent settings 500/16/5/100%.
.
While in the MICU, patient received 1 unit of PRBCs (HCT nadir
of 24.8%), 4 units of FFP total (INR peak 5.2) and was continued
on Augmentin given packing placement. ENT evaluated the patient
and agreed with iniatial management with packing for 5-days. On
[**1-4**], the patient underwent IR-guided successful embolization
of the right sphenopalatine artery and embolization of the left
sphenopalatine artery and left desecending palatine artery
utilizing coils. OG lavage following the procedure was
reassuring. Bronchoscopy in the MICU showed minimal clot burden
and was otherwise normal. The patient did receive intermittent
IV Lasix (20 mg IV x 2) given some volume overload concerns
while in the MICU (net negative 1L for [**1-5**] prior to transfer,
but positive LOS fluid balance of 3L). He was extubated on [**1-5**]
without issue. He did have some ICU-delirium concerns requiring
Haldol IV. Patient was transferred to the Medicine-SIRS team at
that time.
.
While on the Medicine floor, the patient was noted to have
substantial hypoxia to the 80% on room air with evidence of an
A-a gradient and persistent cough concerns. He was dosed Lasix
60 mg IV, received Albtuerol nebs and his CXR showed stable
frank pulmonary congestion with minimal bilateral effusions and
no evidence of consoldiation. Of note, a positive sputum culture
from [**1-4**] showed sparse coagulase positive Staphylococccus.
Given his worsening acute hypoxic failure (ABG 7.43/27/55 on
facemask) and concern for acute congestive heart failure
decompensation, he was transferred to the CCU. Prior to transfer
from Medicine floor, 98.6 60-80 102/60 35 92-94% FM.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is speaking in short
sentences on a Venturi mask.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or pre-syncope.
.
ROS: The patient denies a history of prior stroke/TIA, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. Denies headaches or
vision changes. Denies chest pain, dizziness or lightheadedness;
no palpitations. No nausea or vomiting, denies abdominal pain.
No dysuria or hematuria. No change in bowel movements or bloody
stools. Denies muscle weakness, myalgias or neurologic
complaints. No exertional buttock or calf pain.
