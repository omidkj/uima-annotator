History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yoM with a history of HTN, HL, s/p
bioprosthetic AVR who presented to the ED today after several
weeks of progressive fatigue and moderate malaise. The patient
reports that beginning several months ago he began to note
shortness of breath. Whereas he was previously able to do any
physical activity he desired, he began to have trouble breathing
with activities such as climbing a flight of stairs. His PCP has
been evaluating this with reportedly unremarkable echo, PFTs,
stress test and ECG (reportedly showing sinus brady at 54); he
has recently been started on supplemental oxygen. Two to three
weeks ago the pt noted a fairly acute worsening in his dyspnea,
such he was now SOB with even minimal activities such as
brushing his teeth. Climbing a half a flight of stairs would
greatly fatigue him. He also began to note a sense of
intermittent nausea (no vomiting) and feeling unwell. He denies
any sense of dizziness, weakness or CP, but has noted an
intermittent sense of palpitations as if his heart was racing.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.3, 36, 16, 175/68, 96% 2L. A
basic work-up was performed and the patient was admitted to the
CCU for further care.
.
On arrival to the CCU the pt is comfortable. On complete review
of systems, he denies fevers, chills, cough, black stools or red
stools. No weight change. He does endorse occasional PND
although this has not changed recently; he sleeps on two pillows
at home for general comfort. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Intriguingly, the patient reports an episode one year ago when
he "blacked out" while driving and crashed his car. A trauma
work-up at that time was negative; no explaination for the
apparent syncope was identified per the patient, although he
does report having a carotid duplex performed which showed no
significant abnormalities.
.
Given the patient's significant bradycardia, non-emergent
placement of a temporary pacing wire was attempted by the EP
service on arrival the the CCU. Right IJ access was difficult to
obtain and the wire was unable to be placed.

ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of 45. Left
bundle-branch
block with secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared to
the previous
tracing of [**2091-8-6**] cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation
with a slow
ventricular response.

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets are thickened. The transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

CXR:
Left transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in the standard
position in the
right atrium and right ventricle. There is marked cardiomegaly.
There is no
pneumothorax. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate.
Mild
interstitial edema has improved.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yoM presents with two weeks of shortness of breath and
weakness, found to be in AF with severe bradycardia.
.
RHYTHM: Pt appears to be in AF, of which he does not have a
prior history, as well as bradycardia. Suspect that this
dysrhythmia is likely causing his symptoms. No clear precipitant
for either dysrhythmia (i.e. thyroid dysfunction, medication
effect), thus suspect the bradycardia is secondary to
age-related fibrosis of the conduction system, occuring now in
the setting of idiopathic AF. He was evaluated by EP and
recommended pacemaker placement.  There was an attempt at temp
pacing, but patient was difficult access. Pacer pads were
placed, but patient did not have any episodes requiring pacing.
The pacemaker was placed on [**2108-6-14**] and post-procedure Hct
remained stable.  The patient received vancomycin 1 dose prior
to the procedure and post-procedure.  He was continued on 3 days
of levofloxacin after placement.  The patient had a CXR that did
not show PTX and pacemaker in proper position. An ECHO was
performed on [**2108-6-15**] a
