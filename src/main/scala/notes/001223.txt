History of Present Illness:
21 y/o AAM with PMHx of asthma who was at work and had a
witnessed collapse at work at 11:40am today.  Employees heard
"gasp" and then patient collapsed to floor.  Per family,
employees described some sort of movement while patient was
unresponsive on the floor. Not able to give a time frame for
unconsciousness.
.
EMS was called, described pt as "agitated and fighting."
Conversed but screaming, not able to obtain history, AAOx0.  Had
L supraorbital laceration from fall on L head on counter.  VS in
field HR 90, RR26.
.
At [**Location (un) **] OSH, VS T99.1, HR126, BP140/70, RR27, 98%RA.  Head
and c-spine CT were negative for any bleed or mass.  Intubated
at [**Location (un) **], received Succ/Vecuronium prior to intubation.  Got
Ativan 1mg x6; loaded with Dilantin 1g IV.  Received Vanco 1g
and CTX 2g x1.  U/A neg, utox/stox (-), blood cx's x2 sent.  Had
ABG of 7.40[32[ 275.
.
ROS could not be obtained.  Per family, pt was feeling well last
night and this morning and was not complaining of any fevers,
photophobia, neck stiffness, fatigue or any other systemic
symptoms.

limited study due to motion.  Somewhat prominent cardiac
silhouette and small bowel gas.

elevations or depressions.  No previous to compare.

[**2107-7-29**] CT head: FINDINGS: Consistent with the recent MRI,
within the left parietal lobe is an area of low attenuation
consistent with edema. The known mass in this region is not
clearly appreciated on this CT scan. However, there is a single
focus of high attenuation on series 2, image 25, which could
represent a small focus of calcification versus hemorrhage.
There is no evidence of subdural or subarachnoid, or epidural
hemorrhage. There is no hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline
structures, or alteration in the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation. There are no other areas of mass effect. The
osseous structures are normal. There is mucosal thickening
within the ethmoid air cells as well as sphenoid sinus.

IMPRESSION: Consistent with the recent MRI which showed the
lesion in the left parietal lobe, there is evidence of edema in
this region. There is a punctate focus of high attenuation which
could represent calcification or less likely hemorrhage. No
evidence of subarachnoid, subdural, or epidural hemorrhage.
.
[**2107-7-29**] MRI/MRA Brain: TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 - and
T2-weighted pre- and post-contrast imaging of the brain was
reviewed. In addition, MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]
with 3D time-of-flight imaging and 3D reconstructions was
reviewed.

MR brain with contrast: Within the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the left
parietal lobe is a small thick rim enhancing 7 mm round lesion
with moderate amount of associated vasogenic edema. Signal is
slightly hyperdense to [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter on T2 imaging with a
hypodense surrounding rim. There is no susceptibility to
indicate hemorrhage. Diffusion-weighted imaging demonstrates
mild high signal consistent with slow diffusion. There is no
evidence for dural extension. No other lesions are identified.
Otherwise, the brain is unremarkable with no shift of midline
structures, or abnormal T1 or T2 signal. The ventricles, sulci,
and cisterns appear normal. There is a small amount of mucosal
thickening in the sphenoid sinuses. The paranasal sinuses are
otherwise unremarkable.

MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]: Appropriate flow signal
is present within the internal carotids and common circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] and its major tributaries. Note is made of a right
dominant vertebral artery posterior circulation without evidence
for hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:
1. Thick rim enhancing 7 mm right parietal lesion with
associated edema that represents abscess versus neoplasm.
Correlation with outside CT to determine presence of
calcification is advised, and if access to outside CT is not
available, reimaging is advised for further characterization.
2. Normal MR angiography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]. These findings
were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at 5 p.m. on [**2107-7-29**].
.
[**2107-7-29**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Motion artifacts limit the evaluation
of this study. The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina. The NG
tube tip is in the stomach, but the side hole is at the level of
the gastroesophageal junction. The heart size is normal. A left
lower consolidation is most probably due to atelectasis and is
mild. The pulmonary vasculature engorgement is mild,
representing mild congestion which could be due to volume
overload.
.
[**2107-7-29**] ABNORMALITY #1: This recording appears to have taken
place in about three phases with the first phase the patient was
sedated with Propofol and background rhythms are slowed with
overlying faster beta activity seen. The Propofol was then
turned off and the patient arouses easily and appears agitated.
Background rhythms at this time vacillated
between about an 11 Hz posterior rhythm and were obscured by
faster beta
rhythms and muscle artifact. The Propofol was reinstated and the

background rhythms, once again, became of a lower voltage with
slowing
and faster beta overlying the slowing seen. No epileptiform
activity
was observed throughout any of this recording.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed as this
was a
portable EEG.
SLEEP: No definitive sleep/wake cycles were observed.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a regular rate and rhythm with a rate of

approximately 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of
suppressed
background rhythms and secondary medication effects. With
weaning of
medication, a more normal alpha background-type rhythm does
appear;
however, not for long as this is obscured by mostly muscle
artifact as
well as medication side effect. No focal or epileptiform
features were
seen on this EEG. No electrographic seizures were observed.
.
[**2107-7-30**] CXR: CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2107-7-29**],
again shows the NG tube, which would need to be advanced
approximately 7 cm to have all the side ports within the
stomach. There is decreased pulmonary vascular congestion. There
is a new consolidation within the right lower lobe consistent
with pneumonia. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac contour is
stable. No new pleural effusions.
.
[**2107-8-1**] CXR: There has been removal of endotracheal tube and
nasogastric tube. Previously reported bilateral lower lobe areas
of consolidation have improved, with residual consolidation
predominantly in the right lower lobe. There are probable small
bilateral pleural effusions.
