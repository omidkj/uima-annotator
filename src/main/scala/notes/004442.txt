Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyperglycemia after starting dexamethasone

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2197-8-4**]: LEFT FRONTAL CRANIOTOMY FOR MENIGIOMA RESECTION


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60843**] is a 76 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI in
[**2188**] (subsequent normal cath in [**2193**]), CVA w/o residual
defecits, sCHF, DMII, OSA (nonadherant with bipap), who is
admitted for preoperative hyperglycemia management prior to
meningioma removal scheduled for [**2197-8-4**]. Per the patient and
patient's family, he was in his usual state of health until this
spring when he and his family noticed headaches and generalized
cognitive decline. He began forgetting dates and mixing up his
medications. He then went to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2197-6-15**] where an
MRI revealed a large frontal meningioma. He was then seen by
neurosurgery there who recommended surgery, however, he decided
to come to [**Hospital1 18**] for a second opinion. He then established care
here with neurooncology who noted RLE edema and obtained an U/S
which revealed a DVT. He was started on lovenox. It is unclear
if this is provoked or not. He was started on dexamethasone and
Keppra for his meningioma but he has developed hyperglycemia as
a result. His neurosurgeons therefore decided the patient should
be admitted to medicine for hyperglycemia management prior to
the operation. Of note, his aspirin and plavix were discontinued
on [**7-24**] in preparation of surgery.

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria. Also denies focal weakness, visual problems. [**Name (NI) **] DOES
report unsteady gate and memory difficulties.

[**2197-8-4**] ct brain
FINDINGS: The patient is status post post-left frontal
craniotomy, with
changes related to excision of the previously described left
frontal mass. A moderate amount of pneumocephalus is noted in
the left frontal region. Trace amount of dense material is seen
layering in the resection cavity, compatible with subarachnoid
blood. The sulci of the left frontal lobe are mildly effaced as
is the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. Subtle
left-to-right shift of midline structures is seen, with the
maximum
displacement measuring 3 mm in the transverse plane (2; 15).
Otherwise, there is no large subdural collection, hydrocephalus,
or intraventricular
hemorrhage. Small amount of subcutaneous gas is seen along the
left aspect of the scalp in the region of the surgical
intervention. The visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Incidental
note is made of a hearing aid on the left ear.

IMPRESSION: Immediately status post resection of left
frontovertex
extra-axial mass, with moderate post-procedural pneumocephalus
and trace
subarachnoid blood at the operative bed; mild effacement of
sulci and the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], with 3 mm rightward shift of
midline structures, is unchanged from the pre-operative studies.


[**2197-8-5**] MRI

FINDINGS:

The patient is status post left frontal craniotomy, with
post-surgical changes in the left frontal region as well as the
adjacent parenchyma of the left frontal lobe.
Pneumocephalus and blood products and fluid are noted. There is
moderate
surrounding FLAIR hyperintense signal that is not significantly
changed from the preop study. Areas of increased signal
intensity are noted on the DWI sequence in the periphery of the
resection cavity with decreased signal on the ADC sequence,
which may relate to blood products/areas of ischemia or
infarction in the adjacent tissue. Attention on followup can be
considered (series 502, image 20).


Evaluation for enhancing areas is limited, given the
pre-contrast T1
hyperintense areas. However, there is slightly vague enhancement
surrounding the surgical resection cavity. No areas of abnormal
enhancement are noted elsewhere in the brain. Small fluid
collection is noted in the left subdural space, in the frontal
region. There is also soft tissue swelling with fluid collection
in the soft tissues overlying the left frontal and the parietal
bones (series 6, image 21) along
with blood products. Mild enhancement of the overlying dura in
the left side. Multiple FLAIR hyperintense foci are also noted
in the cerebral white matter, likely related to small vessel
ischemic changes. There is mass effect on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle, with mild rightward shift of the
midline structures and subfalcine herniation measuring
approximately 5 mm. The major intracranial arterial flow voids
are noted, with a diminutive distal vertebral and Basilar artery
with a fetal PCA pattern. There is increased signal intensity in
the mastoid air cells on both sides and in the petrous apices
from fluid/mucosal thickening.

IMPRESSION:
1. Surgical changes in the left frontal region and in the left
frontal lobe parenchyma with presence of blood products as
described above. Unchanged appearance of the surrounding FLAIR
hyperintense signal in the left frontal lobe. Interval
development of an area of decreased diffusion surrounding the
blood products, which may relate to infarction/ischemic changes
in the parenchyma. Assessment for infarction is limited given
the presence of blood products adjacent. Consider followup as
clinically indicated for better assessment.

2. While there is no significant abnormal enhancement to suggest
an obvious residual tumor, followup evaluation can b
