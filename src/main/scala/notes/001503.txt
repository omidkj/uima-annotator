Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
complete sinus arrest, hyperkalemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
64F w/ PMH significant for DM2, CAD, HTN, CRI, CHF was in her
usual state of health until 4 days prior to arrival when she
developed a urinary tract infection and began to take
ciprofloxacin [**Hospital1 **], prescribed by her PCP (of which she took 4
pills thus far). On the morning of admission, she developed an
acute episode of nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, shortness of
breath, light headedness, near syncope, pallor, and garbled
speech for a few minutes.  No witnessed LOC/CP/palpitations/sz
activity.  EMS found patient with heart rate in the 20s in
complete sinus arrest (junctional escape beat), SBP 60/palpable
with no response to IV atropine, so she was transcutanteously
paced.  There were peaked Ts on EKG in field with K=7.3 in our
ED.  She was given CaCl/Bicarb/D50/insulin/kayexalate with good
response of K falling to 5.4 and sinus node recovered without
the help of an intravenous pacer.  SBP remained 70s-90s, so
dopamine was started.  Other initial labs were notable for Hct
19 (bl 30), Na 134, Cr 3.3 (bl 2.5), glucose 324, lactate 3.2,
troponin 0.12, and negative toxicology screen.


Past Medical History:
severe pulmonary hypertension (PAP 60), DM2, CAD s/p NSTEMI '[**52**],
diastolic CHF, HTN, migraines, anxiety/depression, CRI (bl 2.5),
hypercholesterolemia, GERD, ASTHMA, gastroparesis, anemia of
chronic dz, hypothyroidism, pernicious anemia


Social History:
Denies EtOH, tobacco, drugs. Lives with daughter, here from PR
for 26 years, no longer cooks because at times is dizzy.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 97.8, 167/43, 70, 18, 95% on RA
Gen: alert and cooperative, oriented x 3, flat affect, poor
insight since she did not understand that she has chronic renal
insufficiency despite the fact that she continues to urinate
HEENT: MMM, poor dentition, EOMI, PERRLA, CN II-XII individually

Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiovascular: Mrs. [**Known lastname 22003**] had positive troponins but these
were attributed to her asystolic arrest and insufficient
clearance in the face of her chronic renal insufficiency. She
was placed on telemetry, which only showed a few PVCs. Her
potassium was monitored and controlled to within normal limits.
Her ACE inhibitors were held as these can cause hyperkalemia.
The patient was hypotensive in MICU, but stable and even
hypertensive on the floor. Her metoprolol and norvasc were
restarted but the hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued in light
of her acute on chronic renal insufficiency. Her hypertension
was controlled with metoprolol, norvasc, and PRN hydralazine on
the floor. Her metoprolol was not changed to toprol XL in light
of the expense of the latter medication and to reduce confusion
from a changed medical regimen.

Pulmonary: Ms. [**Known lastname 22004**] pulmonary exam was remarkable for
crackles and O2 sats 100% on RA throughout her course. CXR was
consistent with interstitial disease and she was found to have
pulmonary hypertension as well. The patient is currently
asymptomatic. However, we were unable to diagnose any acute or
chronic process as the patient refused CT scan and states that
she would also refuse biopsy.

Heme: Ms. [**Known lastname 22003**] has chronic anemia, worked up in [**Month (only) 547**]. Her
anemia is likely a combination of her poor renal function,
pernicious anemia, and small chronic GI blood losses. An iron
panel, a B12 and a folate were sent and revealed a high ferritin
and a low TIBC consistent with anemia of chronic disease. She
was transfused 2 units PRBCs in the MICU and had a stable HCT on
the floor. Of note, the patient has a history of pernicious
anemia and was restarted on daily oral B12 as well as one IM
injection. Apparently, the patient has missed several nephrology
appointments and was supposed to have been started on Epogen.
The patient stated that she was not interested in ongoing weekly
epogen injections. She did have guiaic positive stools while in
the MICU and so was encouraged to have an outpatient
colonoscopy. Per her outpatient doctor, she has declined these
interventions in the past. Her aspirin was decreased to 81 mg
per day and she was discharged with protonix [**Hospital1 **].

Endocrine: Ms. [**Known lastname 22003**] has well controlled DM with a hemoglobin
a1c of 5.6 on [**6-20**] per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She was placed on SSI in the
MICU but it was discontinued before discharge. On the floor, her
glipizide was restarted with good blood sugar control by the end
of her course. She also has a history of hypothyroidism and on
[**6-20**], her TSH was normal at 3.6 per her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) 22005**]
was continued.

Renal: Ms. [**Known lastname 22003**] had acute on chronic renal failure. The
aspirin, lasix, and lisinopril were discontinued. She returned
to her baseline creatinine of 2.5. Nephrology has been consulted
in past but the patient has missed several outpatient
appointments. Medications were dosed for CrCl of 20. She was
encouraged to call for an appointment with a nephrologist and
given the telephone number at the clinic.

GU: Mrs. [**Known lastname 22003**] was being treated for a UTI shortly before
admission. The organism was klebsiella, sensitive to all
antibiotics except ampicillin. She had 7 total days of a
flouroquinolone, renally dosed (cipro for 4 days before admit,
levofloxacin in the hospital).
