History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86744**] is an 87-year-old man with a history of hypertension,
atrial fibrillation previously on coumadin, and dementia who was
recently admitted for symptomatic cholelithiasis versus
cholecystitis, underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy, was
discharged to rehab, and is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after
presenting to an outside hospital with a GI bleed.
.
He was in his usual state of health until [**2105-9-6**] when he was
admitted for symptomatic cholelithiasis versus acute
cholecystitis and underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy.  His
procedure was uncomplicated and he was discharged to rehab on
[**2105-9-10**].  He was previously on aspirin and coumadin and these
medications were held on discharge, with a plan to restart on
[**2105-9-12**].  He was doing well until the following day when he had
an episode of sharp, periumbilical abdominal pain that lasted
several hours and resolved after an episode of dark brown
emesis.  He presented to an OSH for further evaluation.  There,
his hct at presentation was 26 from a baseline in the low 30s,
and he had an episode of coffee ground emesis and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  En route, he had
an episode of melanotic diarrhea.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: 98.3 62 183/84 16 97%2L.  His
exam was notable for a nontender abdomen and melanotic liquid
stools per rectum.  He denied chest pain, light-headedness, or
dyspnea.  Pantoprazole bolus followed by gtt was initiated and
ED staff consulted ERCP.  They recommended supportive care with
possible endoscopy in the a.m.  Peripheral IVs (16G and 18G)
were placed, and he was crossmatched for four units.  An NG
lavage was deferred per ERCP and he was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
 Hct was 28 prior to transfer.
.

[**2105-9-18**]: Left leg ultrasound.  PRELIM!! No DVT

[**2105-9-15**] echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior
walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve
leaflets are thickened. The transaortic gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak (mild) is
present. The valve appears stable without evidence of
dehiscence. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2105-9-13**] chest x ray:
Cardiac size is top normal. The lungs are hyperinflated. A small
left and
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion have increased
associated with
adjacent opacities consistent with atelectasis. Left pacer lead
terminates in standard position in the right ventricle. There is
no pneumothorax. The
lungs are hyperinflated. Moderate degenerative changes are in
the thoracic
spine. Sternal wires are aligned.


Brief Hospital Course:
GI bleed:
Pt underwent ERCP w sphincterotomy on [**9-7**], had previously been
taken off aspirin and coumadin, now presenting w melena and
coffee ground emesis.  HCT stabilized after 4 units of PRBC.  He
also rec'd IV vitamin K for an INR of 1.5.  He did not undergo
repeat EGD given stability and that the sphincterotomy site was
very likely the culprit.  His hct was stable over days and a
plan was made with the patient and his outpatient cardiologist
to cautiously re
