Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital after being kept in
PACU overnight for cardiac monitoring (enzymes were negative
x3).  He was hep-locked on POD 1, and meds were given via his
G-tube.  On POD 1 he was trasferred to the CSRU for hypoxia,
chest XR showed ? of hemothorax.  Over the next 24 hrs he has a
falling hematocrit, for which he was transfused PRBC and
platelets due to his recent use of plavix.  On the night of POD
2, the patient was intubated secondary to worsening pumonary
function, worsening mental status and worsening CXR c/w
hemothorax.  On the AM on POD 3, he returned to the OR for VATS
chest exploration which found gross hemothorax and oozing at his
staple line.  The details of this procedure can be found in the
appropriate op-note.  Post-operatively, he was returned to the
unit.  He was extubated on POD 1 and did well from this point,
aggressive pulmonary toilet was initiated.  His BP ran hign
postoperativly, and his meds were adjusted appropriatly.  He
underwent broncoscopy in the unit which showed heme tinged
secretions but no pna or gross plugging.  He was being treated
for pneumonia however with vancomycin, ceftaz, flagyl, and
fluconazole (which is lifelong, per his [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgeon). Over
the next few days he improved somewhat, but not enough to
transfer to the floor.  He then made gradual progress ove the
next several days as his respiratory status and mental status
began to markedly improve.  On [**7-11**] his central line was
removed and a PICC line was placed for longterm antibiotics.  On
[**7-12**] the patient had a fever to 102F and was pancultured with
urine culture growing 10,000-100,000 yeast.  The remainder of
the cultures were unremarkable and two of the blood cultures are
still pending at this time though are no growth to date.  Also,
on [**7-12**] the patient had a video swallow study performed that
he failed and thus had to remain NPO.  At this time it was
determined that use of the PEG be the means to continue enteral
feeding and to give medications.  The patient was continued on
tubefeeds of promote with fiber at 55mL per hour as the goal
rate.  On [**7-14**] the patient was deemed fit for discharge to
the floor as he had now improved remarkably and was off the
ventilator.  Also of note the patient did receive occasional
doses of lasix 20mg to keep his fluid balance even as measured
over 24 hour periods.  The patient then had another oral and
pharyngeal swallow study performed on [**7-16**] and again failed
and the patient remained NPO until the time of discharge.  At
the time of discharge the patient was noted to be significantly
improved and to have regained baseline mental status and
activity level, having worked with physical therapy.  The
patient was eager to eat though had to remain NPO as described
above.  He was also afebrile and was requiring minimal care of
his wounds.  Antibiotics were to be continued for pneumonia
described above for a total of three weeks and fluconazole was
to continue indefinitely.
