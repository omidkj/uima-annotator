HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80-year-old
Spanish-speaking woman with an extensive medical history
notable particularly for auto-immune hepatitis cirrhosis and
encephalopathy who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2185-3-19**].  She was discharged
to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation facility.

Her last admission was notable for an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography that was complicated by acute renal
failure and pancreatitis.

On this admission, [**3-30**], the patient was brought from
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation reportedly for a general decline in
her condition that occurred over several days to weeks as
well as an apparent complaint of more recent chest and
abdominal pain.  The records at the rehabilitation facility
indicate the patient has been increasingly lethargic and
confused over the past several days and exhibited worsening
lower extremity edema.  The rehabilitation facility was
unable to maintain intravenous access.  Laboratories there
revealed, among other things, an increased white blood cell
count and worsening liver function tests.  Their records did
not show any recent history of fever.

The patient was unable to give history secondary to
encephalopathy, for which she has had multiple admissions in
the past for.  To be clear, she has a history of multiple
events hospitalization specifically for encephalopathy.

On the last hospitalization (ending on [**2185-3-21**]), she was
admitted to the ACOVE Medicine Service with vague complaints;
including weakness, confusion, and mild epigastric
tenderness.  She was found to have an elevated bilirubin, and
it was felt that common bile duct was dilated.  She underwent
an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2185-3-14**].  There was an unsuccessful attempt to cannulate the
papilla despite sphincterotomy.  Post endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography course was complicated by
pancreatitis and acute renal failure which responded modestly
to intravenous fluids and holding her ACE inhibitor and
diuretics.  Pancreatitis resulted in bile fluid.  An
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on [**2185-3-17**]
had a motion artifact but revealed changes in liver
consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

No dilation of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ducts.
There were stones/sludge in the gallbladder and thrombosis of
the right anterior and right posterior branches of the portal
vein.  The patient was placed on Actigall and sent to
rehabilitation.  Her white blood cell count at that time was
16.6, total bilirubin was 3.2, and creatinine was 2.9.

On this admission, in the Emergency Department, the patient
was briefly hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the
80s which responded well to the intravenous fluids.  Also of
note, at her rehabilitation facility, she was found to be in
atrial fibrillation.

During this hospital admission, she ruled out for a
myocardial infarction.  The Congestive Heart Failure Service
was consulted during this admission.  They recommended
discontinuing her amiodarone and felt that the patient's
fluid overload was secondary to cirrhosis and low albumin in
conjunction with pulmonary hypertension that was not related
to systolic dysfunction.  The patient was also found to have
a lower lobe pneumonia.  She had been treated with
Levofloxacin and Flagyl with an associated leukocytosis and
hypothermia.

Her hospital stay, prior to being transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, was complicated by acute renal failure
(secondary to acute tubular necrosis), and relative
hypotension with atrial fibrillation, and hypercalcemia (with
calcium levels as high as 12), and creatinine as high as 3.6,
and hypernatremia (her sodium was 155 when she was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit).  In
addition, her total bilirubin had been rising with worsening
coagulopathy.  Her INR was 2.7, and her total bilirubin was
4.3 when she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.

Given her poor hospital course, the patient was initially do
not resuscitate/do not intubate by the family; especially
given her history of cirrhosis and auto-immune hepatitis.
However, on [**4-2**], new members of the family had come from
[**Male First Name (un) 1056**], and a family meeting was held, and her code
status was reversed.  She was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for management of her worsening
coagulopathy, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, and declining
mental status.
