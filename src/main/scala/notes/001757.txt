Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18995**] was admitted on [**2199-9-17**] for planned repair of his
thoracic aortic aneurysm.  After appropriate preparation and
informed consent, he underwent endovascular stent graft repair
of his thoracic aortic aneurysm.  He tolerated the procedure
well, and after initial recovery in the PACU, he was admitted to
the cardiovascular ICU for post-operative monitoring, management
of his blood pressure and ICP, and frequent neurologic exams.

Through POD#1, Mr. [**Known lastname 18995**] remained hemodynamically stable and
his neurologic exam continued to be intact.  His lumbar drain
was removed on [**9-18**] without complication.  His diet was
advanced, and he was able to be out of bed to a chair.  His
blood pressure was closely monitored, and kept within the target
range.  He was transferred to the vascular surgery floor in good
condition.

On [**9-19**], he was able to ambulate and his arterial line and foley
catheter was removed.  He voided without difficulty.  His home
medications were resumed, and his fluids heplocked.

On [**9-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname 18995**] was evaluated by the physical therapy team,
who cleared him for home with home physical therapy and a
walker.  He was found to be ambulating at baseline, tolerating a
regular diet, taking oral pain medication, and with a stable
neurovascular exam.  He was instructed to undergo an abdominal
CT scan and follow up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in one month.
He will receive daily home physical therapy, and will follow up
with his PCP for blood pressure management.  He was started on
aspirin, and given prescriptions for oral pain medication.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 18995**] and his wife understood and agreed with the plan.  He
was discharged home with a walker and home PT in good condition
on [**2199-9-20**].
