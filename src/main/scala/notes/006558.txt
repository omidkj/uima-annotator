Admission Date:  [**2116-9-27**]     Discharge Date:  [**2116-10-2**]

Date of Birth:   [**2089-2-18**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 27-year-old
male without a significant past medical history who presented
to an outside hospital and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of 10% to 15% as well as a history of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.

Of note, the patient emigrated from [**Country 4194**] approximately five
months ago.  Approximately over the past one year, he has
noted (per his wife) increased shortness of breath which had
been noted while talking on the telephone.  At this point, it
was not particularly bothersome.  However, over the past
month he had noted mild chest discomfort and increased
shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, as well as
abdominal discomfort (mostly in the right upper quadrant).

He had a workup at an outside hospital which included a
negative right upper quadrant ultrasound, negative lower
extremity Doppler studies for deep venous thrombosis,
negative CT angiogram for pulmonary embolism.  A chest x-ray
at an outside hospital revealed cardiomegaly, angioedema
consistent with heart failure.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further evaluation and
care.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was notable increased
shortness of breath over the past year; especially over the
past month.  The patient denies any orthopnea.  He sleeps
with one pillow.  At this time, the patient tends to gain
weight.  He has no history of weight loss.  The patient has a
history of occasional gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Also of note, the patient has recently moved from [**Country 4194**]
approximately five months ago.  He lives in [**Location (un) 44761**]
and does not travel significantly outside of that area.

Also of note, he had a history of a gastrointestinal
infection with diarrhea approximately two years ago which
lasted for five to six days and has had a history of
bronchitis approximately one year ago.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history is notable for
right knee surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient used to work as a cashier when
he was in [**Country 4194**].  He is currently working at a store that
makes sandwiches.  No tobacco.  Occasional alcohol.  The
patient is married.  The patient has a 5-year-old child.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Mom with a history of a thyroid condition;
questionable if she has diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed temperature was 99.2, pulse was 106,
blood pressure was 122/64, saturating 97% on room air,
breathing at a rate 18.  In general, the patient was a
well-developed and well-nourished male in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed normocephalic and
atraumatic.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Jugular venous pressure was at approximately 6 cm.
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was
regular in rate and rhythm.  Notable for a loud third heart
sound.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended,
with good bowel sounds.  Extremities were without clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  There were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories on
admission revealed sodium was 139, potassium was 4.7,
chloride was 98, bicarbonate was 34, blood urea nitrogen was
13, creatinine was 0.9.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a 27-year-old male with
a past medical history of right knee surgery who presented
from an outside hospital with cardiomyopathy and nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient is a 27-year-old male
presenting with increased shortness of breath; worse over the
past month.

He had an echocardiogram which showed mild left atrial
enlargement.  The left ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.
There was severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.  The
overall left ventricular systolic function was severely
depressed and was estimated to be less than 15%.

Given these findings, the differential diagnoses for the
patient with this low ejection fraction included idiopathic
and viral etiologies, paracytic and bacterial etiologies,
endocrine, and infectious.

Regarding the workup for the patient's low ejection fraction,
the patient had a cardiac stress test.  He underwent an
exercise MIBI test with [**Doctor Last Name 4001**] exercise protocol.  He
exercised for 8.5 minutes, achieving 74% of his maximum heart
rate.  The electrocardiogram findings were interpretable
secondary to digoxin therapy at that time.  However, at the
level of exercise achieved, there was no evidence of focal
perfusion defects.  There was left ventricular enlargement
which was more prominent during stress.  The ejection
fraction was estimated to be 17% with global hypokinesis.

Other etiologies for the workup included a human
immunodeficiency virus test which was negative.  A
thyroid-stimulating hormone was also sent and was within
normal limits.  Treponemal, IgG, and IgM titers were sent
which were pending at the time of discharge.

He also had iron studies sent which were within normal
limits.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Concerning the patient's
congestive heart failure, the patient was started on a beta
blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretics.  His symptoms were
stable, and he did not have any difficulty with shortness of
breath or edema.

3.  ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  The patient was placed telemetry.  At
the outside hospital he was noted to have two runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with 6 and 8 beats.
During the hospital course, he was noted to once again have
brief episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  One
was a run for 16 beats.

The Electrophysiology Service was consulted.  They
recommended starting amiodarone for his rhythm.  Amiodarone
was started, and he was to start at 200 mg p.o. t.i.d. for
two weeks, then to continue at 300 mg p.o. q.d.  His
thyroid-stimulating hormone was 2 (within normal limits).
His liver enzymes were also within normal limits.

Pulmonary function tests were obtained and were pending at
the time of discharge.  During the episodes, the patient was
not noted to be symptomatic.  He was also to follow up as an
outpatient with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts Holter monitor for further
electrophysiology monitoring.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  At the outside hospital, the
patient had some right upper quadrant pain.  At that time, he
had a right upper quadrant ultrasound which was negative.  He
denied any abdominal pain.  His abdominal discomfort may have
been secondary to some volume overload experienced due to
congestive heart failure.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:
1.  The patient was to follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 44762**] for congestive
heart failure treatment on [**10-12**].
2.  The patient was also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] as
an outpatient for further electrophysiology followup.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (His medications on discharged
included)
1.  Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d. (times 14 days total) then
amiodarone 300 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
