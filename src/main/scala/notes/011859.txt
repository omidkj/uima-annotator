Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p falls

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
64 yo female w/hx of DMII, polio (childhood; uses walker and
cane at baseline), mod MR, CKD (beleived to be drug related to
allopurinol or HCTZ, now stopped) associated w/edema, presented
w/ 2 episodes of falling due to bilateral lower extremetiy
weakness. Pt denies having LOC, no pain or head strikes. No
chest pain or SOB. Pt woke this AM unable to get out of bed due
to weakness; had leg numbness and fell x2 w/out LOC or head
strike. Per report, tried to get up to use the bathroom, put
feet in ground and was very weak and fell when she tried to
stand. She had help standing and was ok for few seconds. Denied
SOB, CP, blurry vision. No F/C/N/V, cough, SOB. Had similar
episode 20 days ago that resolved on its own and had not had any
issues since then. Awake and alert. Called EMT given significant
weakness; at time of medic arrival pt was ambulatory. No pain or
injury/numbness or tingling.

In [**Name (NI) **] pt's VS were 98.6 68 135/44 16 98% RA, afeb and normal HR.
Initially, no pain anywhere when presented to ED. On exam, found
to have weakness in straight leg raises bilateraly. Sensory
intact. Lungs sounded clear. However, pressures were labile (SBP
70s-100s); BP 70s and bounce back up on repeat, then sustained
in 80s so RIJ placed and gave 10mg decadron. HR stable. EKG was
unchanged from prior, CE Trop: 0.07->0.05, CK: 1163, MB: 16 (but
in setting of CKD) and no chest pain; pt was given ASA 325.
Elevated LFTs on labs but bedside US or RUQ showed normal
GB/biliary tree. Pt also had elevated WBC 21.7, CXR showed +LLL
hazziness on prelim read and pt was started on vanc/zosyn (after
also getting ceftriaxone). Lactate 1.2. Lipase 90. Given Cr
elevated at 3.0 from baseline of 1.8-2.0 and labile BPs, pt
received 2L IVF and also central line placed. Start on tamiflu.
SBP to 50s with no mental status changes. Started on levophed
BPs to 90s and started having increased work of breathing. Worse
breathing put on bipap lowest to 92% on bipap at 350. Bedside
echo looks like hyperdynamic function. Similar to yesterday
routine echo. Pt was asymptomatic during this, felt fine. X-ray
of lower extremeties and spine performed given symptoms; premil
read does not show any acute process. Neuro consulted. Pt was
admitted to ICU for continued management and treatment. Arms
different BPs, labile in the past because of different arm
pressures. Take BPs on right arm 130-140s. Making urine.

On the floor, patient was on Bipap but quickly taken off. She
was pleasant and in no distress. Denied complaints including CP,
SOB, cough, fever, chills, N/V/D. She reported feeling improved
since arriving in ED.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

Polio as a child

Social History:

previously worked asa seamstress. She has never married nor does
she have any children. She lives with her father in [**Name (NI) 583**].

due to restrictions around where she lives.

Imaging:
TTE [**2201-7-1**]: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic left ventricular function and mild outflow tract
obstruction. Moderate mitral regurgiatation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Elevated estimated left ventricular end diastolic
pressure. Mild functional mitral stenosis due to annular
calcification.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2198-8-20**], LV function is now hyperdynamic with
accompanying outflow tract gradient. Pulmonary hypertension is
identified. The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.

L-spine, pelvis [**2201-7-1**]: Profound osteopenia and degenerative
change. If clinical concern for acute compression fracture is
present, consider MRI for more sensitive evaluation.  No gross
malalignment is seen. There is no pelvic fracture. Hypoplastic
left pelvis is stable.

MRI Head: FINDINGS:

There is extensive, confluent T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity seen in
the
periventricular and deep white matter, consistent with sequelae
of
microvascular ischemia. In addition, there are scattered lacunar
infarcts in the cerebral hemispheres, unchanged since the CT of
[**2198-8-17**].
There is no evidence of acute infarction or hemorrhage. There is
no mass, mass effect, edema or shift of normally-midline
structures. Noted is a
partially-empty sella turcica, a common variant. The paranasal
sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear. There is no abnormality of bone
marrow signal.
IMPRESSION: Sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease,
without
evidence of acute intracranial process.

MR Chest:
FINDINGS:
Some of the images are degraded by motion artifact.
Within limitations of a non-contrast study, no major aortic
abnormality
including dissection, aneurysm, or traumatic injury is
identified.
There is cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions more
prominent on the right, small to moderate in size. In addition,
there is enlargement of the pulmonary artery up to 3.3 cm,
denoting pulmonary arterial hypertension. Chest wall and
mediastinum are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
No acute aortic syndrome, although study is limited due to
motion artifact. Signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension and
cardiomegaly.
