Fever and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
78 yo F h/o DM, CAD, OSA, HTN, PMR on steroids, presenting from
rehab facility with fever to 102.7 and AMS. Patient was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 66503**] for a presumed viral
gastroenteritis. She was dishcharged to a rehab without
incident. While in her rehab facility, noted to be alert and A
&O x3. On [**2163-2-13**], patient was started on levofloxacin for an e.
coli UTI. The night of [**2-17**], the patient developed vomiting and
diarrhea with a temp of 101.4 -> 102.7. BP at that time was
noted to be 133/70 with HR of 128 and o2sat or 90% RA and
patient was reportedly moaning and pale, but cooperative. Noted
to have crackles in LLL. Labs on [**2-18**] showed a wbc of 10.8, Hct
41, cr of 1.1. Patient was started on 75 cc/hr of NS at 0900.
Given concern for new PNA vs. further GI pathology, patient was
sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

In the ED inital vitals were, 103.0 155 103/31 24 96% 4L Nasal
Cannula. Tmax was 104.9 (rectal). Notably blood pressure on
prior hospitalization and in outpatient ranged from 130s-160s.
Mental status was felt to be more lethargic than agitation upon
arrival, however did improve with IVFs. WBC 10.3 with 8% bands,
lactate 3.1. Also noted to have elvated Cr to 2.2 (from 0.8 on
[**2163-2-9**]). CXR concerning for LLL PNA and UA was mildly positive
with 8 wbcs and small leuk esterase.  ED noted abdominal
tenderness and having diarrhea so CT abd/pelvis performed which
suggested enteritis. She received 5 liters NS. 1 gram of
acetaminophen. 4 mg Zofran and 1 gram of vanc and 4.5 gm zosyn.
VS prior to transfer: 102.2 120 18 102/39 124 98%4L.

On arrival to the ICU, patient is sleepy but arousable to voice.
Does drift off back to sleep within seconds. Follows commands.
Requesting to drink water.

Review of systems:  Unable to obtain completely. Does deny pain.

Microbiology:
C diff [**2-19**] and [**2-22**]: negative
blood cx [**2-18**]: no growth
urine cx [**2-18**]: no growth

Studies:
CXR [**2163-2-18**]:
IMPRESSION: New left basilar opacity worrisome for pneumonia.

CTAP [**2163-2-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Fluid-filled small and large bowel which could
potentially be
seen with enteritis, but otherwise unremarkable study.

CXR [**2163-2-19**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval improvement in aeration. No focal airspace
consolidation is
appreciated on the current examination and therefore the
previously described abnormality likely reflected atelectasis
which has resolved in the interim.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, pneumothorax or pleural
effusions.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours remain
stable given relatively diminished lung volumes.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F PMHx PMR on steroids, diagnosed with E coli UTI and
started on levaquin on [**2-13**] who presented w/ AMS, relative
hypotension, fever concerning for sepsis, however infectious
work-up was unremarkable and pt inproved with symptomatic care.

Active Issues:

# SIRS: Patient p/w AMS, hypotension, fever, with uncertain
source of infection; initial CXR w/ possible LLL PNA, so started
on HCAP coverage, but follow-up CXR appeared clear; UA on
admision w/ 8 WBC, few bacteria, culture negative. Given recent
abx usage was also concerned for cdiff, but c diff toxin
negative x 2. Pt was hypertensive and afebrile on transfer to
the medicine floor s/p aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad
spectrum antibiotic coverage (Vanc/Zosyn).  I suspect that the
two most likely etiologies were urinary tract infection (pt grew
E coli on [**2-10**]) or viral gastroenteritis (possibly secondary to
norovirus: pending at the time of discharge).  Therefore pt was
discharged with cefpodoxime x 10 days for treatment of presumed
complicated urinary tract infection.

# AMS: Likely secondary to cause of fever/sepsis, appeared to be
largely resolved by time pt was transferred to the medical
floor.  Unlikely to be caused by [**Last Name (un) **] and electrolytes are within
normal range.  Pt was at baseline mental status on discharge.

# PMR: On chronic prednisone, 15 mg daily, s/p 3 days of stress
dose steriods in the ED.  Pt was restarted on pred 15 mg at
discharge.
