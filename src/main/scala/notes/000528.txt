Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 87 y/o F with h/o CAD s/p CABG [**01**] who is transfered
from OSH after having PEA arrest s/p Right knee replacement.
.
Patient underwent Right knee replacement [**2115-3-28**] without aparent
complications. This morning at around noon patient went into
afib with RVR, diltiazem drip was started but after a bolus she
started droping her HR and BP, code blue was called, patient
received epinephrine, atropine x1 and was intubated.
There were no strips sent during the code. EKG were received and
it seems that patient had an inferior MI and also escape
junctional rhytm after the events. Echocardiogram was done that
showed dilated RV and given high suspicion for PE patient was
started heparin. Patient remained hypotensive levophed and
dopamine were started.
.
Patient transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

4. Hyperthyroidism
5. History of seizures
6. Paroxysmal SVT
7. Osteoarthritis

EKG: Hr 53, junctional scape rhytm. St elevation III.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM bed side echo: largely dilated RV. EF ~ 10-15%


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 87 y/o with h/o HTN, CAD s/p CABG, s/p recent R knee
replacement c/b PEA arrest likely secondary to PE transfered for
further management.

# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Patient with an elevatede A-a
gradient, FIo2 100% and PaO2 60, x ray with no clear evidence of
infiltrates, this is more likely secondary to pulmonary embolism
- continue vent support
- heparin drip
- midazolam - fentanyl drip
- recheck x ray after transfer for ETT tube
.
# Hypotension: Patient with severe hypotension on dopamin and
levophed drip on arrival. Likely secondary to poor cardiac
output secondary acute PE.
- continue IV fluids
- continue dopamin, levophed, and add vasopresin
- Bedside Echo
- holding all BP meds
- Stat labs - lactate
.
# Cardiac:
CAD: EKG from OSH showed st elevations in the inferior leads.
Last troponin 3.36
More likely demand ischemia in the setting of acute hypotension.
.
Rhytm: after external pacer was discontinued, patient with a
junctional escape rhytm.
- continue to monitor
.
Pump: cardiogenic shock
- Bed side echo
- continue dopamin, levophed
.
# Neuro: patient with fix dilated pupiles and dull eyes which
represent severe brain injury. Very poor likelyhood of recovery.
.
# Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) **] HCP - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6621**] cell
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6622**] (H), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6623**] (w)

Addendum:
After patient evaluation, patient clinical status was discussed
with daughter [**Name (NI) **] at length. Given the poor prognosis of
recovery,  worsening acidosis, poor neurological status
patient's code status is changed to DNR. No further scalation of
care.  The patient died within 4 hours of admission to the
hospital.
