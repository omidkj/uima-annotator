Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with history of diastolic heart failure (EF 55%),
PAF not on Coumadin, critical AS valve area <0.8, congenital
VSD, mild dementia, and RLS who presents with shortness of
breath, and transferred to MICU for hypoxia, requiring BiPAP in
the ED.  Beginning last night, she was sitting trying to fix the
cord on her phone, when she became frustrated, and became more
short of breath. She also had some palpitations but denied any
chest pain. She also started to feel some nausea, but had no
emesis and no abdominal pain. She says that this is similar to
previous admissions where she had SOB. She also had a mild
cough, non-productive. She denies any fever, chills or sweats.
She has been eating well, though over the last 2 months has lost
~ 20lbs. Also endorses some mild leg swelling, though this is
unchanged.
.
In the ED, initial VS T 96 HR 68 BP 182/81 RR 32 100% 15L. She
was 97% on 3L NC upon EMS arrival to [**Hospital1 599**] where pt is from. EKG
showed SR 95, LAD, RBBB, V3 now non-inverted. CXR read by the
resident as possible RLL PNA, for which she was given Vanc 1gm
x1, Zosyn 4.5mg x1. She was also given 700cc NS as she appeared
dry. She was subsequently put on BIPAP PEEP 8 Psupport 10 for
1hr. Blood cultures were sent. She had 1 20g for access, with
plans to place another prior to transfer. She was also given
Zofran 4mg IVx1 with resolution of her nausea. VS prior to
transfer 99.0 66 115/39 22 100% on BiPAP.
.
On the floor, she says that she feels much better and is no
longer SOB. She also no longer has any nausea.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with history of heart failure (EF 55%), paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, severe AS valve area <0.8,
congenital VSD, mild dementia, and RLS who presents with
shortness of breath, and transferred to MICU for hypoxia,
requiring BiPAP in the ED. On admission to the MICU, was able to
be weaned to nasal cannula. At this point she was transfered to
the Medical floor for further care.

# Shortness of breath: Most likely [**3-2**] flash pulmonary edema as
similar to previous episodes. Possibly flashed [**3-2**] hypertension
as elevated BP to 180s in ED initially vs. afib with rapid rate.
Other ddx includes ACS vs. PNA. Pt denies any chest pain, ECG
unchanged, and clinical picture more c/w flash pulmonary edema.
Initial trop <0.01. PNA considered given mild cough; however,
without sputum production, fever or chills, in addition to the
fact that CXR findings are unchanged from recent CXR at last
admission, unlikely PNA. Antibiotics of Vanc/Zosyn were given in
the ED x1 dose, but were not continued in the ICU. She was
monitored, and able to be transitioned to nasal cannula the day
of admission. Cultures were sent and showed no growth on
discharge. She was maintained on 2L nasal cannula and this was
continued on discharge with plans to wean at [**Hospital1 **] facility.
.
# Hyperglycemia: Unclear etiology, though possibly [**3-2**] stress
response as pt seems to always come in hyperglycemic with her
flash pulmonary edema. Pt with trace ketones, concerning
initially for DKA, though now BG 77 on admission here prior to
any insulin. Resolved without further issues.

# Chronic renal insufficiency: Cr 1.3 on admission, at baseline.

# Elevated AG: Likely [**3-2**] elevated lactate of 3.1 on admission.
Also likely [**3-2**] CKD. Considered also DKA given hyperglycemia as
above & trace ketones, but as above, hyperglycemia resolved
without intervention. Lactate was repeated and was stable.
.
#. CHF, acute on chronic: Most recent TTE from [**6-/2107**], showing
EF EF>55%, critical aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis and severe
regurgitation, as well as pulmonary hypertension. Pt did not
appear clinically volume overloaded on admission. Lasix was
initially held given pt did not seem volume overloaded, and was
held on discharge with recommendation to consider PRN doses if
volume overload ensues, given her critical aortic stenosis. Her
beta-blocker was h
