CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elective surgery for kyphoscoliosis

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 53-year-old woman
without significant past medical history, who was in her
usual state of health until about two months ago.  On [**2120-5-31**], she suffered an L1 burst fracture and left rib fracture
secondary to a fall from a ten foot ladder (per patient) or
from a second-floor window (per patient's daughter) at home.
She was initially seen at an outside hospital two days later,
after the incident.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
immediately for surgical intervention.  She had a relatively
uneventful perioperative course except for one unit of packed
red blood cell transfusion postoperatively.  She had a total
L1 vertebrectomy, fusion and segmental instrumentation of T12
to L3, cage placement at L1, and autograft during the first
surgery.  She was evaluated by Psychiatry at that time for
possible paranoia and questionable suicidal ideation
postoperatively. Medical workup at that time included a
negative RPR, normal thyroid function tests, and a head MRI
showing possible chronic microvascular ischemia.

She was sent to a rehabilitation facility on [**2120-6-7**], in
stable condition.  About one month later, on [**2120-7-9**],
she was readmitted for elective second operation to correct
kyphoscoliosis.  Again she had an uneventful operative
course.  The second operation included a posterior fusion of
T9 to L3, multiple thoracolumbar laminectomies, segmental
instrumentation of T9 to L3, and right iliac crest graft.
Postoperatively, however, she suddenly decompensated in the
Post-Anesthesia Care Unit while she was receiving a
transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells.  She
complained of sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of
breath with oxygen saturations dropping to 70%, blood
pressure dropping to 70/40.  She was intubated immediately,
and transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.  Progressive loss of bilateral
translucency on chest x-ray and positive anti-HLA and
anti-granulocyte antibodies on hematological workup were all
consistent with TRALI (transfusion-associated lung injury).
While in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, her postoperative
course was further complicated with methicillin-sensitive
staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, pneumonia, and wound
infection (which were documented with positive cultures on
[**7-17**]).   These events eventually led to a prolonged
intubation.  After she was started on intravenous oxacillin
on [**7-20**], she had very good response, with decreased fever
and decreased white blood cell count, as well as clearing of
bacteremia which was documented by several blood cultures
drawn on later days.  She also underwent incision and
drainage of posterior wounds on [**7-23**].  Wound cultures
showed decreased colonization of methicillin-sensitive
staphylococcus aureus and rare colonies of E. coli.  She also
had a diagnostic pleural tap on [**7-26**] for persistent left
pleural effusion.  The final culture was negative.  She had
repeated TTE on [**7-22**] which showed no vegetation and left
ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%.  She also had
a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis on [**7-25**], which
showed improving effusion and normal bowels with old splenic
infarct.  CT angio was also performed, which showed improving
atelectasis and effusion without evidence of pulmonary
emboli.  She was extubated on [**7-28**], and transferred to
Medicine on [**7-30**] in stable condition.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unavailable

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.9, blood pressure
132/80, pulse 122, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 94% on
room air.  General:  Thin, middle-aged woman, lying in bed,
with thoracolumbar brace in place.  A little confused, able
to follow simple commands, answering simple questions.  Alert
and oriented x 1 (person).  No apparent distress.  Head and
neck:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric, pupils equal,
round and reactive to light. Neck supple.  Chest:
Well-healed left lateral posterior surgical scar, nontender,
no erythema.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2, no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally
(anterior and lateral).  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm to touch, no edema or
cyanosis.  Distal pulses 2+ bilaterally.  No calf tenderness.
On Venodynes.  Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through XII
intact, strength equal bilaterally, sensory intact.
Psychiatric:  Appeared disoriented and paranoid.  Skin
intact, no rashes.

LABORATORY DATA:  White cell count 17.9, hematocrit 34.1,
platelets 509.  Differential:  71% neutrophils, 19%
lymphocytes, 8% monocytes, 2% eosinophils.  Sodium 138,
potassium 3.8, chloride 104, bicarbonate 24, BUN 7,
creatinine .3, glucose 76.  Calcium 8.2, phosphorus 3.6,
magnesium 1.6.  PT 13.0, PTT 30.4, INR 1.2.  Liver function
tests:  AST 82, ALT 52, LD 319, alkaline phosphatase 201,
amylase 29, lipase 22.  Two recent blood cultures on [**7-22**]
and [**7-27**] were negative.  Urine culture on [**7-22**] and [**7-27**] were negative.  Wound culture on [**7-23**] showed decreased
methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus.  Stool cultures
were negative for C. difficile. Catheter tip culture on [**7-25**] was negative.  Chest x-ray on [**7-26**] showed decreased
left pleural effusion without pneumothorax, decreased
congestive heart failure, persistent left basilar
atelectasis.  CT on [**7-25**] showed an old splenic infarct, no
abnormal bowel or liver or fluid collection.  CT angio showed
no evidence of pulmonary emboli, increased left pleural
effusion, ground-glass attenuation consistent with volume
overload.  TTE:  Left ventricular ejection fraction greater
than 55%, small pericardial effusion.  Pleural tap showed no
malignant cells.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  While on the Medical service, she was
continued on oxacillin and showed improvement with decreased
white blood cell count and decreased temperature.  Six weeks
of intravenous oxacillin was recommended by Infectious
Disease consult, given the patient's high risk of relapse due
to the hardware placed inside the originally-infected wound.
A PICC line has been placed for the long course of
intravenous antibiotic treatment.  So far, all blood cultures
drawn after starting oxacillin were negative to date.

Her initial symptoms of tachycardia have also resolved,
likely due to a combination of measures including intravenous
hydration, improved pulmonary function with incentive
spirometer.  Repeated chest x-ray showed improving
atelectasis.  Repeated CTA revealed no evidence of pulmonary
emboli.

After she was medically stabilized and weaned off all
sedatives including Haldol, Ativan, Zantac, her mental status
improved dramatically.  Signs of underlying psychiatric
disorder became more obvious.  She appeared paranoid and
delusional at times, and seemed lacking of insight into her
disease.  Given her questionable history of alcohol abuse and
poor nutritional status currently, vitamin B12 and folate and
thiamine and a multivitamin were given as supplements.  A
head CT revealed age-inappropriate atrophy such as seen in
increased risk for dementia.  Psychiatry recommended
restarting on Haldol to control psychotic symptoms and
continue one-to-one sitter until the patient was no longer at
high risk of eloping from the hospital.  The patient's
psychotic symptoms improved with gradually increased doses of
Haldol.  Now the patient has been doing well without a
one-to-one sitter for more than 24 hours.
