[**6-15**] IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Evaluation of the
subsegmental
arteries is limited by motion and low lung volumes.
2. Findings suggesting congestive failure, including
cardiomegaly, bilateral effusions, interstitial thickening and
edema, and contrast reflux into the hepatic veins. Marked
prominence of the main and right and left pulmonary arteries,
suggesting associated pulmonary hypertension.
3. Consolidation at the left greater than right lung bases with
associated
volume loss most likely representing atelectasis. Impaction of
the left lower lobe bronchi suggests aspiration or mucus
plugging. No definite evidence of pneumonia.
4. Small lung nodule in the left upper lobe (4 mm). Since the
patient has a risk of obstructive lung disease, follow-up CT
surveillance is recommended in one year.
.
[**6-17**] Rotated positioning. There is moderate to moderately severe
cardiomegaly. Dual-lead pacemaker is present, with lead tips
normal in position. Diffuse vascular blurring and a presumed
prominence is compatible with interstitial edema. There are
small bilateral
effusions with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
Increased
retrocardiac density. Rounded lucency seen in the region of the
left hilum
may represent airways seen on end. No pneumothorax is detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 year old Russian-speaking woman with history of
diastolic CHF (EF 55%, [**4-/2170**]), COPD who lives at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
presents with worsening hypoxia.
.
# Dyspnea:  Patient with clinical history of both COPD
exacerbation as well as CHF.  She presented to the floor and was
started on Prednisone 60mg ([**6-12**]), nebulizers and levofloxacin.
She was also actively diuresed.  Her O2 requirement did not
improve and on day 3 she became slightly unresponsive and there
was some concern that she was going into hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  pCO2 at the time was 88, but her pH was within normal
limits.  She was given a face mask as opposed to nasal cannula
and her pCO2 decreased to 60s and she became slightly more
responsive.  However, on day 5 of admission after sleeping for
the night she awoke and was very unresponsive and shaking.  She
urinated and her shaking resolved slightly, but unresponsiveness
continued.  Her pCO2 was in the 70s and continued to rise.  She
was tried on BiPAP on the floor and this did not help.  She was
transferred to the unit for further management on BiPAP.
Unfortunately the patient did not tolerate bipap well and it was
hard to find a mask that sealed well to her face. This was
decided not to be an option for her. Her c02 continued to climb
into the low 100s.  Patient was continued on 02 to maintain sats
in the low 90s (with COPD).  If her oxygen got too high, her
mental status worsened.  She was treated for HAP with 10 day
course planned for Vanc/Zosyn started on [**6-16**]. She already
completed 5 day course of levaquin. She was also planned for
long steroid taper or steroids, methylpred chosen because NPO.
The methylpred 40mg IV q8h([**6-13**]) was started day prior unit
transfer. She remained on that until [**6-18**] in which she was
started on 20mg IB q8. She was tapered to 10mg IV BID today
which should be continued for [**2-4**] more days and then tapered per
[**Hospital **] rehab.  She tends to be a mouth breather so sometimes
requires face mask. Only on 2L upon discharge satting 95%. Her
lasix is currently on hold an
