History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 32090**] is a 69 yo F with sig PMH for DM, CAD s/p CABG,
a.fib and CHF with LVEF of 20-25% presents to ED feeling weak
and fatigued. She started dialysis two weeks prior and since
then her BP has been low, she has been dizzy, LH with nausea.
She states that all of these symptoms are aggrevated with
movement. She also stated that since dialysis has started her
glucose levels have been low and her appetite has been
decreased. She has difficulty lying flat and uses 3 pillows at
night. She denies any new medications recently, she also denies
fever/chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, syncope and rash. Her
last dialysis treatment was yesterday.
.
ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults):
- Initial Vitals/Trigger: trigger for hypotension
- EKG: ST elevations but unchanged from prior
- ASA taken in the AM
- troponin elevated to 0.3 in setting of elevated Cr
- BPs down to 80s with normal mentation -> 1 L bolus given
slowly and BP increased from 80s to 100s
- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] alerted -> can scale back meds
- Hyperkalemia -> no ekg changes, 30 g kayelexate, 1 L fluids
.
On arrival to the CCU pt was mentating well, able to answer all
of my questions appropriately in NAD. She was denying symptoms
of CP, SOB, N/V, LH or dizziness.
.
On review of systems, she denies  bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  All
of the other review of systems were negative.

Baseline artifact. Probably sinus rhythm with A-V nodal
Wenckebach.
Poor R wave progression. Cannot exclude an old anteroseptal
myocardial
infarction.

ECHO [**9-3**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is milldy dilated. There is
akinesis of the septum, and moderate to severe hypokinesis of
the remaining left ventricular segments. LVEF (20-25%) .The
right ventricular cavity is dilated and hypokinetic. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. The study is inadequate to exclude
significant aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild
to moderate ([**1-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with mild cavity dilation and severe
left ventricular systolic dysfunction as detailed above. Dilated
and hypokinetic right ventricle. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation.

Compared to the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-7-31**],
estimated pulmonary artery pressures are lower (may be
underestimated due to poor acoustic windows). The severity of
mitral regurgitation has increased.

CARDIAC CATH [**9-5**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild

non-obstructive plaquing. The LAD is occluded proximally. There
was
severe in stent restenosis of the distal OM1 and a de [**Last Name (un) 11083**]
lesion more
distal to this. The RCA was not injected and is known to be
occluded.
2. Venous conduit angiography demonstrated an ostial/proximal
90%
stenosis in the SVG to RCA. The RCA system was free of
significant
disease. The SVG to OM was patent with new disease at the
anastamosis
and in the bypassed vessel.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated the LIMA to LAD to
be
patent.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right heart
filling
pressures (RVEDP 24mmHg and LVEDP 27mmHg). There was moderate
pulmonary
artery hypertension (52/32mmHg). The SVR was low and was
significantly
elevated (500 dynes*sec*cm-5 and 186 dynes*sec*cm-5). The CO and
CI were
normal in the context of anemia (5.6L/min and 2.4 L/min/m2).
There was
no gradient across the aortic valve on careful pullback from the
LV to
the ascending aorta.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Occluded SVG to Diagonal and new stenosis of SVG to RCA.
3. Patent LIMA to LAD.
4. Significantly elevated left and right heart filling pressures
with
moderate secondary pulmonary artery hypertension.
5. Hypotension likely due to a
