Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis






Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
upper endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 84 yo F w/ h/o GERD, AFib, CAD, COPD, HTN, TIA,
PVD, w/J tube recently admitted ([**Date range (1) 16006**]) with J-tube
dysfunction.  The patient was admitted [**2147-7-10**] because she
awoke and vomited bright red blood two times (each approxmiately
1 cup). In the ED, the patient was afebrile and normotensive.
She was found to be in Afib with rates to the 120s. A NG lavage
showed 150cc coffee grounds, and the patient had melena from
below. Pt. not clearing completely after 500 cc NS and was
transfused 1 Unit. The patients hct was 28 from a baseline of
approximately 30. GI was called and wanted to admit to ICU for
EGD. Also, troponin elevated to 0.06. Per cardiology likely
demand ischemia and recommeneded transfusing PRBC.
.
The patient was in the ICU and her brief hospital course is
listed below.  Her EGD showed friable esophag. mucosa and
[**Last Name (un) **].  For her drop in hct from 28.4-27.7, she was given 2
Units of PRBC and responded appropriately (hct 35.8).  She was
maintained on a PPI, carafate, and her ASA was held per GI
consult.  For her UTI, she was started on bactrim, and had no
issues.  For her afib, her digoxin and metoprolol were held, in
the setting of the GIB.  In addition to the above issues, she
was found to have a troponin leak, but this was attributed to
demand ischemia, and no intervention was required.  The
patient's rheumatoid medications were held during her course as
well.  Finally, per imaging her G tube was found to be displaced
and surgery will be notified.
.
On the floor, the patient denied increased SOB, CP, dizziness,
increased weakness, back pain, suprapubic tenderness.  Unchanged
dysuria.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**7-10**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.
2.  Improvement of the congestive heart failure and left lower
lobe
atelectasis
.
EGD: Grade 4 esophagitis in the GE junction and distal lower
third of esophagus.  Patchy erythema in the stomach body.  G
tube in place with distal end near cardia.
.
[**2147-4-28**] ECHO (most recent):
1.The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
2.There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Though the views are limited, it appears that there might be a
small area of distal septal hypokinesis.[Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3.The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is a small pericardial effusion. No tamponade is
present.
9. There is a large pleural effusion present.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84 year old female with history of reflux,
atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), COPD,
hypertension, TIA, PVD, who presents with Upper GI bleed due to
esophagitis, and urinary tract infection.
.
1) Upper GI Bleed - The source of the patient's GI bleed was
likely from her friable esophageal mucosa, we continued to
monitor her hematocrit, until it was stable.  Once she was
stable, we restarted her home medications through her GJ tube.
We continued her on a proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **], carafate and
held her ASA.  After being in the ICU, she did not require any
further transfusion.  We stopped her IVF, once she was stable
and she did well with her diet being advanced as tolerated.
.
2) Atrial Fibrillation - The patient was having afib with rate
up to 150's in ED, and up to 120's in ICU.  Once on the floor,
she was not actively bleeding so we restarted her home
medications of digoxin and metoprolol, and maintained her on
telemetry.  She remained stable on these medications, and her
tachycardia improved.
.
3) Troponin Leak - This was likely demand ischemia, in the
setting of a GI bleed, so we continued to check her hematocrit
to keep her stable.  She did well and her tropinins improved.
She would likely benefit from seeing her outpatient cardiologist
once she is out of rehab.
.
4) Urinary tract infection - Her UA was positive, so we sent
urine cultures.  She was started on bactrim, but when her urine
culture was negative we stopped her antibiotic.  She remained
afebrile, and did not have signs of symptoms of infection.
.
5) Coronary artery disease - The patient was stable, and as
above her troponins improved.  Per the GI service, we restarted
her metoprolol and lipitor through her GJ tube.  We held her ACE
and lasix, to avoid hypotension and the patient did well.  Her
aspirin was held due to her bleed and this as well as her ACE
and Lasix should likely be restarted by her primary care
physician.
.
6) Diabetes - We held her home medications of metformin and
glipizide.  She was given sliding scale insulin and had one
episode of hypoglycemia which responded well to half an amp of
dextrose.  She did well once we halved her dose of sliding scale
insulin.
.
7) Rheumatoid arthritis - In the ICU, her hydroxychloroquine,
prednisone and sulfasalazine, were held initially.  She was
stable on the floor, so we restarted these medications through
her GJ tube and she had no problems.
.
8) LUQ tenderness (at GJ site) - The patient had just had her GJ
readjusted, so this was likely normal.  She remained afebrile
and her pain improved, but we notified Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the
physician who placed the tube) about this and the suboptimal
placement of the tube.  No intervention was necessary and the
patient's pain improved.  Dr.
