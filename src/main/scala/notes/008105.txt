Service:  MEDICINE CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 31-year-old
female with past medical history of pulmonary embolism and
pulmonary hypertension status post thromboendarterectomy at
UCSD three weeks ago, who had been started on Coumadin prior
to her discharge, who for the past week had been complaining
of increasing shortness of breath with exertion and at rest,
and substernal chest pain x1 week.  The morning of admission
she had complained of orthopnea, no PND, so she went to the
Pulmonary Clinic, where Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] had a CT of the chest
done, which showed that she had a pericardial effusion.

She was sent to the Emergency Room.  An echocardiogram done
in the Emergency Room showed a 3-4 cm circumferential
pericardial effusion with right atrial and right ventricular
collapse.  The patient was sent to the Catheterization
Laboratory for pericardial centesis after having been given a
unit of fresh-frozen plasma.  No vitamin K was given
secondary to the patient's anticoagulation needs.  850 cc of
fluid were drained.  The patient's hemodynamics and symptoms
improved.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient had chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, orthopnea, shortness of breath, presyncope, no PND,
no edema, no palpitations, or syncope.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. She had a pulmonary embolus which was diagnosed in [**2199-9-17**] in the distal left main with extension to the upper
and lower bronchi and right main bronchi.
2. Pulmonary hypertension.  She had been starting on Coumadin
in [**3-20**]. Status post thromboendarterectomy at UCSD.
4. Placental abruption.
5. Postpartum thyroiditis.
6. IVC filter in place.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Coumadin 10 mg [**Month (only) 766**], Wednesday, Friday, 15 mg Tuesdays,
Thursdays, Saturdays, Sundays.
2. Tylenol #3 prn.
3. Tylenol PM prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  She has no history of
tobacco use, social alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had a pulmonary embolus.  Her
father had a DVT.  She has an aunt with lupus.

EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs in the Emergency Room:  97.2,
121/74, heart rate of 99, respiratory rate of 18, and sats
100% on room air.  In general, she was alert and oriented
times three, a thin white female in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Mucous
membranes moist, oropharynx clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular,
rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  She had a three-component
friction rub, no murmurs.  She had jugular venous distention
to 9 cm.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds
present.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Her
pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  Groin:  She had
postcatheterization left femoral A-V sheath.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count was 10, hematocrit
was 33.7, platelets of 502.  Her complete blood count within
normal limits.  Her INR was 4.2.  Her LFTs were within normal
limits.  Hypercoagulable workup in the past had been
negative.

STUDIES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM:  CTA of the chest showed no
pulmonary embolus, large pericardial effusion.  The last
echocardiogram in [**5-20**] showed an ejection fraction of 55%
with right ventricular hypertrophy.

The transthoracic echocardiogram on the day of admission
showed a 3-4 cm circumferential pericardial effusion with RA
and RV collapse, and respiratory variations consistent with
tamponade.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate of 100,
it was normal voltage.  She had T-wave inversions in V3 to V5
which were old and questionable pulsus alternans.

The patient was admitted to the CCU after having gone to the
Catheterization Laboratory, where they drained 850 cc of
bloody fluid.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  Cardiovascularly:  The patient's
drain was left in place.  The plan was not to discontinue the
drain until the output had fallen to almost 0, but with the
plan of restarting the Coumadin prior to pulling the drains
to make sure that no further accumulation of fluid would
happen.  Her hematocrit after the drain was placed were
checked q3h until they stabilized.  Even though the patient's
hematocrit dropped to 33 to 27, she was not transfused as she
was a healthy female with no coronary artery disease.

On the evening of admission, followup chest x-ray showed
pneumopericardium.  Thoracic Surgery was consulted.  They
felt that this was not significant.  It was probably likely
due to having drain the pericardial effusion, and her
pericardium having been stiff from being expanded for so
long.  Thus, no action was taken.  She was hemodynamically
stable.  Of note, the pericardial drain significant amounts
of fluid and air were drained from the patient and the
pneumopericardium had resolved as of the 9th.

The patient on the 9th, had drained 875 cc of fluid.  Her
pain was being controlled.

Pulmonary wise:  She was being weaned off oxygen.  She had
been on 3 liters of oxygen prior to going to pericardial
drainage.  Her Coumadin had been held as her INR was 4.0 on
admission.  Echocardiogram done on the 9th showed an ejection
fraction of 55%.

On the 10th, the pericardial drain drained 150 cc.  Her
Coumadin was restarted that evening and Heparin was started
as well as the patient's INR had become subtherapeutic.  Her
pain was still being controlled.

On the 11th, the patient had a small nosebleed likely due to
the oxygen.  She was given humidified air to breathe.  Her
sats had remained stable throughout.  The pericardial drain
was discontinued on the 11th as it had put out less than a
half a cc in 24 hours.

On the 12th, the patient had been stable overnight.  Her INR
was 2.5, and her pain has been controlled.  As she had no
other acute needs, she was discharged home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  If she experiences any chest pain,
felt short of breath, or increasing fatigue, to please [**Name6 (MD) 138**]
her M.D. or go to the Emergency Room.  She is being
discharged on Coumadin 10 mg tablet to be taken every
evening.  Her Coumadin level was currently therapeutic.  She
needs to have her INR level checked by her PCP later that
week.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Pericardial effusion.
2. History of pulmonary embolism status post
thromboendarterectomy.
3. History of pulmonary hypertension.
4. Hypomagnesemia which was repleted.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  She was to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**8-4**] at 1:45 pm.  She was to have a
follow-up echocardiogram, [**First Name3 (LF) 766**], [**8-11**] at 11 am.  She
was to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] on [**9-29**] at 11:30 am.

MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  Cardiac
catheterization, repair of pericardial effusion drainage.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

POST-DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Ibuprofen 600 mg take one q8h prn for seven days.
2. Coumadin 10 mg po q hs at bedtime.  This would be dosed by
her primary care physician.
