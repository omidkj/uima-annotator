Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Unsteady gait

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis [**2142-1-14**]

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81-year-old female with a history of stage IV NSCLC
diagnosed in [**5-/2140**], now getting palliative XRT, who presents
today after she was unable to rise from a seated position on her
bed. Patient states that she was sitting on her bed tonight and
tried to get up to go to the comode, but felt "very imbalanced"
and sat back on the bed. She subsequently was able to make her
way to the toilet, but her husband was worried that she was so
unsteady that he called 911. Patient reports noticable
instability for the past few weeks; nothing acute, but increased
trouble rising from a seated position and extra help needed with
ADLs. She denies any falls in the past few weeks.
Upon arrival in the ED, patient was found to be short of breath,
with an 02 sat of 50-60% on room air. She immediately came up to
100% with a face mask. A CXR was done, which showed a
significantly larger pleural effusion. Patient received a CTA
over concern for PE, which was negative. EKG showed frequent
PVCs, but no concerning ST changes. Troponin was 0.02 and
patient received ASA. Initial vitals were: T: 98.0, HR 86, BP:
146/71, RR: 22. Vitals upon transfer were: HR: 103, BP: 160/83,
RR: 25, SP02: 98% on 5 liters. Patient was more comfortable,
though still breathing at 25 times/minute.
ROS: Patient actually denies any trouble breathing, stating that
she has had some DOE, but nothing at rest. She also denies any
fever, "chest congestion," nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest
pain, hemoptysis, dysuria, or other symptoms.


Past Medical History:
--NSCLC: Patient is followed closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] of heme/onc
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of rad-onc. A CT scan on [**12-25**] showed extensive
disease (though slightly diminished from prior) with large
right-sided tumor and metastatic spread to liver. Plan is for
further review of cytology by pathology, and then possibly
initiation of systemic chemotherapy.
--Asthma as a child
--Left knee replacement
--Right hip fracture s/p ORIF [**2140**]
--Hypertension
--Amaurosis Fugax in [**2129**]
--AAA repair [**2140**]
--Tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, mastoidectomy as a child
--Appendicectomy
--2 C-sections


Social History:
Patient is married and has 2 sons. [**Name (NI) **] husband is a
psychiatrist, and one son is a neurologist in [**Name (NI) 760**]. She
used to work at [**Hospital3 1810**] as a medical librarian. She
is a longtime heavy smoker, [**1-20**] a pack per day from age 18, for
an estimated total of 30 pack years. Occasional ETOH.

Family History:
Father with chronic leukemia and mother with HTN.

Physical Exam:
On admission
Temp: 98.6 HR: 98 RR: 28 BP: 132/92 SP02: 96% on 5 liters
General: Thin, no acute distress, tachypnic
Chest: Diminished breath sounds on right, scattered crackles
Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2; frequent
PVCs
Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, non-distended. +BS
Extremities: Trace edema bilaterally; in pneumoboots
Neuro: A&O x3, though initially thought it was [**2140**]. Easily
re-directable. UE and LE motor exam grossly intact. Rectal tone
deferred.


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-13**] Portable: Increased now large right effusion.
Underlying consolidation not excluded. Right upper lobe
mass,increased in size from [**2141-7-19**], but likely similar to CT
[**2141-12-25**] . Additional lung findings and lymphadenopathy
are better assessed on a prior CT.
.
NCHCT [**1-13**]:
1. No acute intracranial process. Please note limited
sensitivity of
non-contrast CT for intracranial metastases for which
gadolinium-enhanced MRI is a better modality.
2. Moderate atrophy which may reflect age-associated
involutional changes.
3. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
.
CTA chest [**1-13**]:
1. Overall worsening multiloculated right pleural effusion with
interval
increase in multiple necrotic masses, compatible with
progression of
metastatic lung cancer.
2. Multiple foci of air within the right pleural cavity admixed
with
associated pleural effusion, mildly increased since the prior
study which may be due to necrosis but raises the possibility of
a bronchopleural fistula.
3. Rounded 2.1 cm hepatic dome low-attenuation lesion (3:88),
suboptimally
characterized given arterial phase of imaging. This could
represent a new
metastasis or venous structure and attention on followup is
recommended.

CT Head [**1-16**]
1. Study significantly limited due to motion.
2. No CT evidence of large metastases, within the limitations.
Pl. check the model and MR safety of aortic graft and if safe,
consider MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] without and with contrast.
3. Unchanged moderate volume loss and chronic small vessel
ischemic disease



Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81-year-old female with a past medical history of
NSCLC who presents from home with a 2-day history of worsening
shortness of breath.
.
SHORTNESS OF BREATH: Shortness of breath most likely from
increasing tumor burden and worsening pulmonary effusions. Other
possibilities include infection, cardiac cause, or pulmonary
embolus (though ruled out with CTA). Infection is unlikely given
absence of fever, leukocytosis, or localizing symptoms. Cardiac
cause is also lower on the differential given an absence of
cardiac history.  The patient continued to have an oxygen
requirement following admission, and underwent an IR-guided
thoracentesis after CT chest showed a loculated right-sided
pleural effusion.  1.1 liters of exudative pleural fluid were
removed, with subsequent improvement in oxygenation.  The
interventional pulmonology service were consulted regarding
possible placement of pleurx catheter in right thorax given
likely recurrence of malignant pleural effusion in setting stage
IV non-small cell lung cancer. The patient was transferred to
the MICU in anticipation of bronchoscopy. IP performed rigid
bronchoscopy on [**1-17**] which was consistent with postobstructive
pneumonia. Patient became progressively more hypoxic after this
procedure despite supplemental oxygen and antibiotics. Patient
underwent repeat bronchoscopy on [**1-18**] with additional removal
of purulent material. Patient subsequently became bradycardic
apneic and expired on [**1-18**]. DNR/I status was confimred with the
patients husband and HCP prior to the patient's passing.
.
INSTABILITY/WEAKNESS: Ms. [**Known lastname 100083**] main complaint on arrival is
instability and inability to get up off her bed without falling.
Complaint is likely multifactorial, with etiologies including
hypercalcemia, deconditioning, and poor appetite and intake.
Patient also has a history of cervical spondylotic myelopathy,
which could contribute to her weakness.  Mild hypercalcemia was
treated with IVF.  TSH and cortisol were normal.  The patient
received physical therapy during her admission.

.
HYPERCALCEMIA: Patient with elevated calcium, espeically in
light of low albumin. In addition to other etiologies,
paraneoplastic syndrome were entertained in an individual with
lung cancer (possibly squamous cell -> PTHrP).  The patient
received IVF initially during her hospital course, and calcium
was monitored.  Hydrochlorothiazide was held because of
hypercalcemia.
.
LUNG CANCER: Patient with stage IV NSCLC. Patient was unable to
tolerate chemotherapy after her initial diagnosis, and is
currently being treated with palliative XRT. The plan is for
further evaluation of her cytology, with the possibility of
further systemic treatment.  Her primary oncologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3274**], suggested interventional pulmonology consultation as
above.

HTN: Held HCTZ.
.
HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA: Continued statin.
.
DECREASED ENERGY: Continued Ritalin 5 mg daily.
