Allergies:
Simvastatin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Flail mitral valve leaflet

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left and right heart catheterization,coronary angiography, left
ventriculogram
[**2174-3-25**]:
Mitral valve repair with a triangular resection of the middle
scallop of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (P2) and a
mitral valve annuloplasty with a 28 mm future CG ring.
Coronary artery bypass grafting x2 with reverse saphenous vein
graft to the marginal branch of the posterior descending artery.
[**3-25**]:  Re-exploration of mediastinum for postoperative
hemorrhage


History of Present Illness:
80yoM with h/o AFib, CHF, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia transferred
from Caritas [**Hospital6 5016**] for evaluation of flail
posterior mitral valve repair.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital6 3105**] in [**9-/2173**] for
Legionella pneumonia when he had multilobar infiltrates,
received 2-3wk course of oral ABx and resolution of PNA. He was
doing well, then had a motor vehicle accident [**9-/2173**] due to
syncopal episode at which point per pt he began to have off and
on SOB and was told to have a stress test and echocardiogram,
the results of which are below, but basically the stress test
was negative and the TTE was most significant for flail
posterior mitral leaflet with either subchordal rupture or
vegetation, 4+ MR, 3+ TR, concentric LVH, and evidence of volume
overload.
Pt was then admitted to Caritas [**Hospital3 **] for further workup
of what appears to be initially most concerning for the
vegetation, which included TEE. TEE ruled out vegetation and
showed a flail posterior mitral leaflet with subchordal rupture
with severe 4+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] there were mostly significant for WBC
count 10.3, BUN/Cr 28/1.3-1.4. BCx's negative x3. The pt is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for workup of mitral valve repair.
ROS significant for increased fatigue, SOB, DOE, occasional
PND/orthopnea, occasional palpitations. He also endorses two
syncopal episodes in the past several months. He mentions a 30lb
wt loss when he was recently diuresed with Lasix, he denies that
he's ever had heart failure or swelling before. He feels that
his condition has been deteriorating since his episode of PNA.
He denies f/c/ns, no CP, no HEENT problems, no n/v/d/c/abdominal
pain, no dysuria, no skin changes, no joint changes.

1. 70-79% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery.
2. Less than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.
[**2174-3-22**] cardiac cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
free of
angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.  The LAD had
a 40%
stenosis in the proximal vessel, and a 40% stenosis in the
distal
vessel.  There was a small first diagonal branch that had an 80%

stenosis.  The LCx had mild luminal irregularitites.  The mid
vessel had
an eccentric lesion with a 70% stenosis prior to bifurcating
into a
large OM1.  The lower pole of OM1 had a focal 80% stenosis.
There were
also serial 40-50% stenoses in the remainder of the first OM
branch.
The RCA had diffuse 80% proximal and mid vessel stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with RVEDP 13 mmHg and mean PCWP 16 mmHg.
There was
moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension PASP 54 mmHg.
The
cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 l/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Slightly elevated left sided filling pressures.
[**2174-3-22**] CT chest without contrast
FINDINGS: 16 x 7 mm left upper lung spiculated nodule adjacent
to the
ascending aorta (4A:71) has slightly irregular margins. 5 mm
nodule in the
right middle lung is perifissural (4A:119). Few other bilateral
sub 5-mm
nodules, the largest in the right middle lobe (4A:140) are
noted. The
airways are patent to the subsegmental level.
Heart size is mildly enlarged. There are small simple right
greater than
left pleural effusions. There is no pericardial effusion. There
are small
atherosclerotic calcifications along the ascending and
descending aorta.
This exam was not optimized for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
Bilateral high
density material in the renal collecting system which represents
minimal
residual contrast from prior study. Hypodense liver lesions
likely
representing cysts and gallstones are noted.
Bone windows demonstrate no lesion concerning for metastasis or
infection and no evidence of acute fracture.
IMPRESSION:
1. 16 x 7 mm left upper lung spiculated nodule may represent
infectious,
inflammatory or neoplastic etiology. Given history of pneumonia,
recommend
followup in 3 months after therapy to document expected
resolution or
stability and to excluded neoplatic growth.
2. Small bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions.
3. Scattered borderline enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and
sub-5-mm
pulmonary nodules can be followed in 3 months.
4. Moderate cardiomegaly.
