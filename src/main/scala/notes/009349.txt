History of Present Illness:
71 year old male with h/o Hodgkin lymphoma, s/p LAD stent in
[**2099**] [**Hospital1 2025**] after abnormal stress test who presented to [**Hospital1 3325**] with epigastric pain and was found to have elevated

but developed fever 101.7 and he was transferred overnight for
ERCP. He underwent ERCP yesterday successfully. He developed
shortness of breath, wheezing with no chest pain. He received
nebulizers and 5 mg IV of IV lasix with improvement. His EKG
showed a NSR, with HR 94, NSR, st flattening depressed in v5-v56
and v1<1mm up. poor R progression. Troponins were checked and
came back as 0.03. Then at 5 am, he had another episode of
shortness of breath in the absence of chest pain. His EKG showed
HR 96, NSR< st scooping avr
and v1 with st depression 1mm I avl, v6. He was sent for cardiac
catheterization and was found to have left main and three vessel

DIAGNOSIS:
Polyp, intra-ampullary:
- Fragments of adenoma (low grade dysplasia).
- Additional levels were examined.

ECHO [**2-20**]
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild to
moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with h/o CAD s/p LAD stents, Hodgkins lymphoma
s/p radiation, HTN, DMII who presented with cholangitis,
admitted for ERCP - followed by perioperative development of
recurrent episodes of SOB and elevated cardiac biomarkers, was
found to have 3 vessel & LMCA disease. Patient was transferred
from [**Hospital3 **] for cholangitis. He underwent emergent ERCP
with stone/sludge via balloon.  There was an incidental finding
of a 8 mm polypoid mass in the common bile duct, in proximity to
the ampula.  The biopsy of which showed adenoma with low grade
dysplasia.  Pt was treated with unasyn between [**2110-2-15**] and [**2-18**].
Pt will need a repeat ERCP for removal of the adenoma. He
underwent cardiac catheterization, and was found to have three
vessel and left main disease. The patient was brought to the
Operating Room on [**2110-2-20**] where the patient underwent coronary
artery bypass grafting times 5
with left internal mammary artery grafted to left anterior
descending, reversed saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending artery, posterior left ventricular branch, marginal
branch and diagonal branch. See operative note for full details.
 Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  He developed a leukocytosis of 21,000.
Urinalysis and culture and blood cultures were negative and he
remained afebrile. All antibiotics were stopped and his WBC was
13.3 at this time of discharge.  He did have a small amount of
erythema at upper sternal pole and a minimal amount of turbulent
drainage was able to be expressed. He was given 1 dose of
Vancomycin and sent home with Keflex x 7 days with strict
instructions for daily showers, betadine wipes with dry sterile
dressing changes twice a day and to call the office with any
temperatures >100.4, increased drainage or erythema. He will
return in 1 week for a wound check. The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was
ambulating freely, he was afebrile and the wound was healing
with a small amount of turbulent drainage at upper sternal pole
and pain was controlled with Tylenol.  The patient was
discha
