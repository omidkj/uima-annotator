Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9223**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, headache

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
evacuation of left subdural hematoma

History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year-old man readmitted to neurosurgery on [**10-31**]
for reaccumulation of left subdural hematoma, now s/p [**10-31**]
evacuation. The patient was previously admitted on [**9-27**] to [**Hospital1 **]
neurosurgery ICU after falling backwards down 5 steps with LOC
found to have bilateral SDH, extensive SAH and intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.  During that stay patient had complicated course
including craniotomy and evac of right subdural hematoma, MRSA
pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, right hemisphere stroke, sent to
rehab [**Location (un) 38**] with trach and peg on [**10-27**] and then returned
for headaches, fevers.  Found to have subdural hematoma,
evacuated and in ED found to have temp to 103.8, started on
vanc, ceftriaxone, flagyl, (had completed course of vanco on
[**10-28**] for MRSA pneumnia) switched to vanc, ceftaz, flagyl on
[**11-1**] after subdural hematoma evac for possible pseudomona.
Subsequently found to have [**4-29**] blood culture positive (initially
GPC pairs/chains--switched to vanc for few days then  Vanco
resistent Enterococcus facecium back on  [**11-5**] so switched to
linezolid.  Blood cultures cleared after [**10-31**]. Urine has been
negative, chest x-ray likely failure and cannot rule out
pneumonia.  IVC filter placed [**11-5**]; rash on torso on Lidex;
[**11-4**] head CT stable.  Probable sources include line from
previus admission, sskin breakdown, PEG, angio cath peripheral
line .  TTE today to rule out endocarditis. Bandemia and fevers
resolved since admit(afebrile since admission.  LUE pICC placed
[**11-5**], without central access on this admit. (since [**10-11**]) No
central line preceding or during bactermia.

HEAD CT with 10/05CLINICAL INDICATION: This is a 76-year-old man
status post fall on [**2125-9-27**]
with increased lethargy, bilateral subdural hematomas, left
frontal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage status post right-sided craniotomy
and evacuatgion
of a right subdural hematoma. Also with multiple infarcts.
Assess for
interval growth of hemorrhages.
TECHNIQUE: Axial 5 mm sections of the brain were obtained and
compared to the
most recent prior non-contrast head CT dated [**2125-10-8**].
FINDINGS: When compared to the prior study of [**2125-10-8**], there has
been
pronounced interval increase in the size of the chronic-
appearing, left
subdural hematoma. This subdural hematoma now demonstrates
severe mass effect
on the left cerebral hemisphere. There has also been interval
development of
rightward shift of the midline structures and a prominent amount
of subfalcine
midline shift. There has been interval resolution of the
hematoma in the
inferior left frontal lobe. The right subdural hematoma is
stable in size and
there has been evolution of the blood products within it. There
are stable
areas of encephalomalacia in the right anterior and middle
cerebral artery
territories, consistent with chronic infarctions. The
subarachnoid blood in
the right cerebral sulci has resolved when compared to the prior
study.
IMPRESSION: Significant interval increase in the size of a left
chronic
subdural hematoma with new rightward midline shift and mass
effect.
This report was called immediately to you on [**2125-10-31**] at 9 a.m,
with
recommendation for emergent neurosurgical consultation, in view
of the size
of the left sided subdural hemorrhage.

[**2125-11-2**] chest xray:
INDICATION: History of pneumonia.
CHEST X-RAY, PORTABLE AP: Comparison made to prior study of one
day earlier.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The tracheostomy
tube is unchanged
in position. There are increased interstitial markings within
the lower lobes
which are not significantly changed in the interval and are
suggestive of
congestive heart failure and pneumonia cannot be excluded.

[**2125-11-6**] chest x-ray:PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2125-11-6**] COMPARED
TO [**11-5**].
CLINICAL INDICATION: PICC line placement.
A left PICC line is present, with the distal tip terminating in
the region of
the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium. A
tracheostomy tube
remains in place. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable,
allowing for
marked leftward patient rotation. There has been interval
worsening of
congestive heart failure and worsening of a confluent left
retrocardiac
opacity, as well.
IMPRESSION: Left PICC line terminates in region of junction of
the superior
vena cava and right atrium. Repeat non-rotated radiograph may be
helpful to
confirm that it has not extended into the proximal right atrium.


[**11-6**] Ultrasound abdomen:

INDICATION: 76 year old with bacteremia, assess PEG site for
fluid
collection.
LIMITED ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: Selected images were obtained
adjacent to the
patient's feeding tube site. There is no evidence of abnormal
fluid
collections. Noted is adjacent peristalsing bowel within the
peritoneum.
There is a mild amount of subcutaneous edema adjacent to the
tube insertion
site.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of abnormal fluid collections adjacent
to PEG site.

[**11-6**] upper extremity ultrasound:
INDICATION: History of bacteremia, assess for thrombophlebitis
of the right
internal jugular vein.
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color
Doppler images
of the right internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial
and basilic
veins were obtained. Normal compressibility, wave forms and
augmentation was
demonstrated. No intraluminal thrombus was identified. Noted is
calcified
plaque within the imaged portion of the right common carotid
artery.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.

[**2125-11-6**] hip:
HISTORY: Subdural hematomas and stroke. Assess for left hip pain
status-post
fall.
AP PELVIS AND AP LATERAL VIEWS OF LEFT HIP. There is
mild-to-moderate degenerative change in the left hip with joint
space
narrowing and marginal osteophytes. The AP view of the pelvis is
obtained in
obliquity. Allowing for this, no fracture or dislocation is
detected
involving the proximal left femur.
