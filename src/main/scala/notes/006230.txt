Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath [**2154-8-9**]
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated
two-vessel disease. The LMCA had no significant stenosis. The
LAD had a diffuse 70% stenosis in the mid portion. The LCx had a
99% thrombus in the proximal portion. There was a small OM2 with
diffuse disease and high OM1 free of significant disease. The
RCA was small and non-dominant with an anterior take-off.
2. Inferolateral STEMI
3. Successful aspiration thrombectomy and PCI of the proximal
LCx with 3.0x18mm drug-eluting stent post-dilated to 3.5mm (see
PTCA comments).

device.


History of Present Illness:
70 year old female with a history of hypertension,
hyperlidipemia, diabetes, smoking history and no known CAD who
presented to the ED complaining of chest pressure. Patient
reports that about six months ago started experinced substernal
chest pressure with radiation to the neck, jaw and back on
excertion after walking for 2 blocks which would resolve after
resting for few seconds. In the interim she was seen by her PCP
who recommended [**Name Initial (PRE) **] stress test which patient refused.  Yesterday
patient reports as she was walking outside she starting getting
similar chest pain that were happening more frequently with less
amount of exertion and she had to rest frequently to relieve her
symptoms.  Then this morning at 7:30 am she was in her bed when
she developed [**5-/2102**] dull ache in the chest associated with
worsening SOB, nausea and diaphoresis.  She took aspirina and
tylenol which did not relive her symptoms.  She continued to
have constant pain and SOB until 12:30pm when her daugther
insisteted that she co to the ED and called EMS. EMS arrived
today and administered aspirin and one nitroglycerin and her
symptoms almost completely resolved. She has not had any recent
surgeries travel immobilization, no history of thromboembolic
disease in self or family.
.
Initial vitals in ED triage were T 97.2, HR 114, BP 127/70, RR
22, and SpO2 90% on RA.  Initial Troponin was 0.03 with CK 101
and CKMB 5.  Labs were notable for WBC 13.0 (N 87.8%), Hct 36.4
(unclear baseline), Plt 269, Cr 1.1 (at baseline), unremarkable
electrolytes, and normal coags. EKG showed sinus tachycardia
with inferolateral
.
Code STEMI was called.  She was given Nitroglycerin SL, Morphine
5 mg IV, Metoprolol 5 mg IV, and started on a Heparin drip.  She
was taken directly to the cath lab.  Vitals prior to cath lab
transfer were HR 125, BP 156/84, RR 24, and SpO2 96% on RA.  She
was found to have a proximal LCx 99% lesion with thrombus which
was treated with Export aspiration thrombectomy followed by PTCA
and stenting with a Promus DES.  Her RFA access site was closed
with a 6F ExoSeal device.   She was admitted to the CCU for
post-cath monitoring.
.
On reaching the CCU, she reports feeling well without any chest
pain or shortness of breath.  She dnies any hsitory of
orthiopnea, PND or peripheral edema, syncope, lightheadedness.

Cardiac Echo:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF = 25 %) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis
of the inferior septum, inferior free wall, posterior wall, and
lateral wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Impression: inferoposterolateral myocardial infarct; severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction; inferobasal aneurysm

Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this left dominant system
demonstrated
two-vessel disease. The LMCA had no significant stenosis. The
LAD had a
diffuse 70% stenosis in the mid portion. The LCx had a 99%
thrombus in
the proximal portion. There was a small OM2 with diffuse disease
and
high OM1 free of significant disease. The RCA was small and
non-dominant
with an anterior take-off.
2. Inferolateral STEMI
3. Successful aspiration thrombectomy and PCI of the proximal
LCx with
3.0x18mm drug-eluting stent post-dilated to 3.5mm (see PTCA
comments).
4. Successful right femoral arteriotomy closure with 6F ExoSeal
device.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old female with a history of hypertension,
hyperlidpiemia, diabetes, smoking history and no prior known CAD
who presented found to be having a inferolateral STEMI with
thrombotic lesion in the proximal LCx treated successfully with
aspiration thrombectomy and DES.

Active Issues addressed on this hospitalization:
# Inferolateral STEMI: Patient with multiple cardiovascualr risk
factors (obeseity, HTN, HLD, smoking history)and 6 months of
exertional chest pain presented LCx STEMI. She had successful
PCI to the LCx with placement of a DES. She did well
post-procedure. She was started on ASA 81mg, Plavix, Metoporol,
and atrovastatin and her home lisinopril was continued. She had
a follow up echo (report included in this D/C summary) that
showed significant wall motion abnormalitis with a moderatly
depressed ejection fraction. She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
an outpatient for follow up cardiac echo and for nuclear stress
test for her CAD as discussed below.

# CAD: The patient had a stent to the LCx but was also found to
have that her LAD had a diffuse 70% stenosis in the mid portion.
There was a small OM2 with diffuse disease and high OM1 free of
significant disease. The RCA was small and non-dominant
with an anterior take-off. She has proper medical managment for
this level of disease at this time. It was also stressed to her
that she needed to kee
