Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain
Transfer from [**Hospital3 35813**] Center in [**Location (un) 37361**] RI, for left
main cardiac catheterization.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
   68yo M with no prior hx of CAD but multiple risk factors
including DM, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, active tob use and
obesity who initially presented to OSH ED on [**2129-6-15**] with 3
weeks of stuttering chest pain acutely worsened while playing
pool.  As per OSH report, he had excruciating mid epigastric
pain described as "punched in the stomach" on the morning of
admission.  In the ED, he was given SL Nitro, Morphine IV,
Phenergen IV, PPI IV and GI cocktail.  At the OSH, he had peak
CEs with positive troponins (0.14 -> 4.56 -> 11.87 -> 8.32 this
AM with normal range between 0 to 0.03) and CK/MB (313/46 this
AM with normal range between 38 to 174).  Once he ruled in he
was started on integrillin gtt and brought to the cardiac cath
lab pain free on 5L O2.  A cardiac catheterization was performed
through the right femoral artery resulting in a laceration of
the profunda s/p covered stent with development of a thigh and
pubic hematoma for which he was given 1unit PRBC.  Subsequently
a radial approach was attempted and the pt was found to have a
critical stenosis of the left main (80% LMCA, 80% ostial LCx,
60% mid LAD, 40 to 50% mid RCA).  A 30cc IABP was placed through
the left femoral in the cath lab for the left main disease and
he was transferred to the CCU.  At this time, the integrillin
was discontinued and he was started on heparin gtt at
1000units/hour instead.  In the CCU, the pt developed
hypercapnea and hypoxia with PCO2 of 70 and PaO2 of 80-90s on
oxygen.  He was started on BiPAP but continued to decline
clinically with worsening hypercapnea, and given the added
possibility of impending surgery he was intubated and vented on
AC at 550 x 20 with PEEP of 5 and FiO2 of 50%.  At this time, he
was transiently placed on neosynephrine.  A CABG was considered
but deferred due to high surgical risk and instead the pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization of the left
main disease.  A subclavian TLC was placed prior to transport.
He was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2129-6-16**].
.
   The pt arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] at 22:30.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, the pt
was intubated and sedated, unable to unaswer questions.

ECHO (TTE) [**2129-6-18**]: 1. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is at least mildly mildly
depressed. (no percentage assigned) The septum and inferior

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68yo M with DM, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, + active tob use
transferred from OSH in IABP in L femoral for intervention of
left main disease.  He is s/p failed attempt at access in the
right common femoral with perforation of right profunda femoral
requiring covered stent and his hospitalization at OSH was
otherwise complicated by hypercapnia/hypoxia thought to be due
to COPD/OSA.
.
1.  CV:
A.  Coronaries: The pt has left main disease as per report from
OSH, however he has been declined for CABG due to his poor
candidacy for invasive surgery.  Instead underwent high risk
interventions - stents from LM to LAD and LM to LCX as well as
RCA. Continue ASA 325mg once daily, Atorvastatin 80mg QHS,
loaded w/ Plavix at 600mg --> now 75mg once daily.  Ace
inhibitors and beta blockers held due to hypotension. Would
considering starting ace inhibitor and beta blockers in
out-patient setting if blood pressure tolerates. Patient has
follow-up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 553**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 496**] in the cardiology clinic in one
month.
.
B.  Pump:
Echo shows mildly depressed EF (no # assigned). Appears
euvolemic currently. Should have repeat echo in [**2-4**] months.
.
C.  Rhythm: NSR by ECG and telemetry.
.
D.  Valves: No significant disease by echo.
.
2.  Right femoral lac: The pt is s/p covered stent at OSH for
laceration. Given the size of ecchymosis and bleed, at this
point, further anticoagulation was avoided.
Patient initially treated empirically with cefazolin. He was
discharged on a course of levofloxacin.
.
3.  Respiratory: Patient arrived intubated. The pt's ABG on
admission suggested respiratory acidemia with low oxygenation.
Likely COPD and OSA contributing. Patient received course of
stress dose steroids. Patient was weaned off vent and continued
on nebs given his COPD history. He was discharged on Atrovent
nebs and a prednisone taper.
.
4.  DM: Initially held oral hypoglycemics and covered
hyperglycemia with an insulin gtt. Transitioned off the gtt and
started on NPH  ultimately required 35 units q.am and 20 units
qp.m. Amaryl was restarted on discharge.
