RADIOLOGY IMAGING

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:[**2169-12-19**]
Large right frontoparietal subdural hematoma. This likely
represents a subacute/chronic hematoma with recent
re-hemorrhage. There is associated mass effect, compression of
the right lateral ventricle, and slight leftward subfalcine
herniation.Small left frontal convexity chronic subdural fluid
collection.No other foci of hemorrhage are identified.


HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: [**2169-12-25**]
Reason: seizure post craniotomy - is there a bleed?

No significant interval change in the appearance of the right
subdural hemorrhage with pneumocephalus. No new intracranial
hemorrhage identified.

[**Last Name (un) **] DUP EXTEXT BIL (MAP/DVT)  [**2169-12-27**]
Reason: r/o DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old woman with low grade temp - prolonged Bedrest and
Increase HR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVT
INDICATION: History of low-grade temperature and prolonged bed
rest and increased heart rate. Evaluate for DVT.
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUNDS: Grayscale and color
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was performed of the right and left common
femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal veins. Normal
compressibility, waveforms, augmentation, and flow demonstrated.
No intraluminal thrombus is identified.

IMPRESSION: No DVT is identified.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] from outside hospital. She
was intubated in emergency department for cognitive decline and
was transferred to the ICU in preparation for surgical
decompression. She underwent a right-sided craniotomy for
evacuation of hematoma, adhesiolysis, duraplasty (for further
details please see dictated operative report dated [**2169-12-20**]).
Post-operative management included dilantin and decadron, strict
blood pressure control, blood sugar control, and
hyperventilation. Vent was progressively weaned and patient was
extubated on post-operative day 2 without sequele.

As patient remained stable, she was transferred to the
neurosurgery step-down unit on [**2169-12-24**]. The following day,
patient developed a seizure (as described by RN) which lasted
1-2 minutes and had resolved by the time house officer arrived
to examine the patient.  Neuro exam was essentially unchanged
after the described seizure and she remained hemodynamically
stable with good oxygen saturation. She was administered ativan
and transferred to the ICU for further observation. Dilantin
dosing was increased per neurology recommendations.
Patient's neurologic status improved and she continued to be
without seizure activity. She was subsequently transferred to
the step-down unit and continued to be free of seizures. Since
patient was unable to successfuly pass a Speech and Swallow
challenge, a percutaneous endoscopic gastric tube was placed on
[**2169-12-27**] for nutritional support.

Syncope work-up was also initiated. Post-operatively patient
experienced tachycardia with heart rates reaching 140's.
Cardiology service was consulted and patient was started on
lopressor and digoxin.  TEE was obtained and showed a left
atrium that is mildly dilated, a moderately dilated right
atrium, severe global left ventricular hypokinesis to akinesis
with some preservation of basal inferior and basal lateral wall
motion and a severely depressed left venttricular function,
severe global. Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
On admission patient was found to have a urinary tract infection
that was treated with levaquin.

Patient failed speech and swallow evaluation and a percutaneous
endoscopic gastric tube was placed on [**2169-12-28**] for nutritional
support.  On [**2170-1-3**] patient passed video swallow and was placed
on a regular diet with no restrictions.  Poor PO intake so tube
feeds were continued cycled at night until pt pulled out her
gtube on [**2170-1-20**].  PO intake alone has been encouraged since
that time with supplements.
On [**1-5**] cspine flex/ex films done. Cspine cleared clinically and
collar was removed.

Her digoxin level has been followed and dosages c
