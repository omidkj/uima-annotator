PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgitation is present. There is a well position intra-aortic
balloon pump catheter in the descending thoracic aorta

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic pressure remains preserved. The remaining
study is unchanged from prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
At catheterization she developed hypotension during ultrasound
and an intra aortic balloon was placed and pressors begun.  She
continued to be mildly hypotensive after that and medications
were adjusted.  On [**10-18**] she was taken to the Operating Room
where revascularization was undertaken as noted in the operative
note.  She weaned from bypass with the balloon in place, Neo
Synephrine and Propofol infusions. She transiently lost foot
pulses, but these returned.  She was stable, the intra aortic
balloon was removed on POD 1 and she was aggressively diuresed
for fluid overload.

A Lasix infusion was continued for 48 hours and she was
extubated on POD 2. CTs and pacing wires were removed on POD 3,
she remained stable.  Beta blockade was resumed and oral
diuretics begun.  Physical Therapy was consulted for mobility
and strength.  She continued to make good progress and was
cleared for discharge to [**Hospital 54752**] [**Hospital **] Nursing Home an Rehab
on  [**10-24**].  All follow up appointments  were made.
