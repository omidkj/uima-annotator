Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
PEA arrest in the ED

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Temporary pace wiring placed on [**2127-7-31**] and removed
on [**2127-8-3**]


History of Present Illness:
Prior Hospitalizations
74F with a hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, diabetes who has recent
complicated medical admissions.  In [**2127-2-25**], she had an
intracatheterization MI (clotted off LAD, LCX on [**2127-3-24**]) with
cardiac arrest and subsequent resuscitaiton requiring ECMO.
Kissing stents of the LMCA into the LAD and Lcx were deployed.
The patient course was complicated by RP bleed. Her last echo
([**2127-3-28**]) shows LVEF 30% with LV basal and mid inferior
hypokinesis with basal and mid inferolateral and lateral
akinesis.
.
The patient most recent hospitalization was [**7-17**] -[**7-24**].  During
which time she had CHF symptoms and found to have an increase PA
pressure.  The patient was started on Amiodarone and instructed
to restart Toprol.
.
Current hospitalization
Pt was in usual state of health until day of admission when she
took first doses of Toprol XL (25mg) (~2PM). She began to
complain of DOE and headache and presented to the ED ~11PM on
day of admission.
.
EMS found HR to be in 50s, BP 70s/palp. In ED was given fluids,
and began to feel slightly better. Admitted to OBS. Patient then
began to brady down to 40s in junctional rhythm ultimately
requiring Atropine, then Epinephrine and transcutaneous pacing
as well as a second liter of fluid.


Cardiology consult was called and at the time of arrival,
patient had been intubated for airway protection given continued
bradycardia and hypotension. Dopamine was started with minimal
effect. During evaluation, patient went into PEA and was given
epinephrine 1mg with good effect, and pulse was reestablished.
Dopamine was run wide-open. Following initial stabilization,
patient returned to PEA, and ACLS/CPR was initiated. Patient
continued to receive epinephrine up to a total dose of 5mg as
well as glucagon, at which point she was again stabilized on
dopamine drip 20mcg.


STAT Echocardiogram following stabilization revealed:
No effusion, mild RV hypokinesis, good LV function, 2+MR.

Once the patient stabilized she was tx to the CCU.

ECHO [**2127-8-1**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is moderately depressed with focal akinesis/thinning of
the basal  2/3rds of the inferolateral and inferior walls. The
remaining segments contract well. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with severe hypokinesis of the apical 2/3rds
of the free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. ?Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen (focused views). There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
ECG [**2127-7-31**]
Junctional mechanism at rate 52 with marked Q-T interval
prolongation and
anterolateral T wave inversion. Consider drug effect, primary
CNS pathology and/or myocardial ischemia. Also noted is right
axis deviation. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2127-4-15**] the
mechanism is junctional rather than sinus, the rate is slower,
Q-T interval prolongation (borderline on the prior tracing) is
now marked, and there is new T wave inversion in leads V2-V5. T
waves are inverted in leads I, aVL and V6 on both tracings.
.
ECG [**2127-8-1**]
Compared to the previous tracing the rhythm is now sinus
bradycardia at
rate 51 rather than junctional at rate 52. Q-T interval
prolongation and
precordial and lateral T wave inversions persist. The
differential is as
before.
.
ECG [**2127-8-4**]
Sinus rhythm
Consider left atrial abnormality
Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure
Consider right ventricular overload
Nonspecific T wave abnormalities
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2127-8-3**], no significant change





Brief Hospital Course:
Course in the ED
EMS found HR to be in 50s, BP 70s/palp. In ED was given fluids,
and began to feel slightly better. Admitted to OBS. Patient then
began to brady down to 40s in junctional rhythm ultimately
requiring Atropine, then Epinephrine and transcutaneous pacing
as well as a second liter of fluid.


Cardiology consult was called and at the time of arrival,
patient had been intubated for airway protection given continued
bradycardia and hypotension. Dopamine was started with minimal
effect. During evaluation, patient went into PEA and was given
epinephrine 1mg with good effect, and pulse was reestablished.
Dopamine was run wide-open. Following initial stabilization,
patient returned to PEA, and ACLS/CPR was initiated. Patient
continued to receive epinephrine up to a total dose of 5mg as
well as glucagon, at which point she was again stabilized on
dopamine drip 20mcg.


STAT Echocardiogram following stabilization revealed:
No effusion, mild RV hypokinesis, good LV function, 2+MR.

The patient was transferred to the CCU and her course was as
follows:

1. Cor: The patient has a hx of CAD s/p kissing stents of
LAD/LCX.  The patient was maintained on aspirin and plavix.  The
BB and amiiodarone were initially held.  The BB was later
restarted.

2. Rhythm: The etiology of the patient's PEA was unknown.
During the initial part of her course she was in a junctional
rhythm and hypotensive.  An atrial pacer was placed  and the
patient remained in NSR and her BP improved.    The patient was
later weaned off of the dopa gtt and the pacer was removed.  Her
BB and Amiodarone were held as this may have contributed to her
PEA.  It was later felt that the patient's presentation was
secondary to the amiodarone.  The patient was restarted on
lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].  Amiodarone has since been listed as one of
her allergies.

3. Pump: During the code, an emergency ECHO was performed.  No
pericardial effusion was noted.  The patient's EF was 35-40%.
The final report was significant for the following:
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic
   function is moderately depressed with focal akinesis/thinning
of the basal
   2/3rds of the inferolateral and inferior walls. The remaining
segments
   contract well. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with severe
   hypokinesis of the apical 2/3rds of the free wall. The aortic
valve leaflets
   (3) are mildly thickened but with good leaflet excursion. The
mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. ?Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen
   (focused views). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.

After reviewing the ECHO , the patient's cardiologist
recommended MV re
