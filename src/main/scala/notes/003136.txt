Radiology:
CXR [**2151-3-9**]: Interval development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary
edema.
KUB [**2151-3-9**]: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern.
.
CT Abd [**2151-3-7**] OSH: Pancreatic edema with extensive pancreatic
inflammation, no free air, pseudocyst.
.
ABD US [**2151-3-8**]: no gallbladder thickening, stones, or ductal
dilatation

[**3-10**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The
increased transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac
output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**3-26**] ECHO: no vegetations
.
[**3-11**]: CT abdomen/pelvis: 1. More than 50% areas of
non-enhancement within pancreatic bed consistent with necrosis.
No pseudocyst or abscess is seen within the pancreatic bed. No
biliary ductal dilatation of pancreatic dilatation is seen.  2.
Non occlusive thrombus of superior mesenteric vein is noted.  3.
Extensive fluid accumulation within the abdominal cavity
predominantly anterior to the stomach and in the anterior
pararenal space.
.
[**3-24**]: CT abdomen/pelvis: 1) Pancreatic pseudocyst measuring 13.7
cm x 5 cm with significant inflammation and fat stranding noted
in the peripancreatic area. 2) Bilateral pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis. 3) Sigmoid diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis. 4) Bilateral inguinal hernias.
.
[**3-31**]: CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: 1.  Extensive pancreatic necrosis
with large pancreatic fluid collection, probably slightly
increased since the prior study.  2.  Bilateral moderate pleural
effusions with compressive atelectasis.  3.  Multiple lower lobe
lung nodules some of which are tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] in configuration and
may represent an infectious process versus aspiration.  4.
Stable bilateral large fat containing inguinal hernias.  5.
Filling defects versus contrast mixing in the bilateral internal
jugular veins. Ultrasound could be performed to exclude
thrombus.  6.  Fluid collection next to the left adrenal gland
versus small adrenal
lesion.
.
[**4-6**]: CXR: Interval decrease in the bibasilar pleural effusion.
Otherwise,
stable as compared to yesterday.

[**4-8**]: CT abdomen/pelvis: pending

Brief Hospital Course:
42M h/o hypertension, presents with idiopathic acute necrotizing
pancreatitis with pseudocyst.  Hospital course by problem:
.
# Pancreatitis: Etiology unclear on presentation (no h/o EtOH
abuse, no stones on RUQ U/S, normal Ca2+, only mildly elevated
TG, no trauma). Perhaps medication related (lisinopril, HCTZ) or
viral. CT abdomen as above demonstrated extensive pancreatitis.
Followup film showed pseudocyst formation.  There was no abscess
seen in either film.  Patient was followed closely/daily by both
the GI service and pancreatic surgery service.  They
participated actively in his management.  His disease, although
severe, was not deemed necessary for surgical repair.  Instead,
we provided supportive care with respiratory ventilation,
nutritional needs, and prophylactic management.  Amylase and
lipase normalized by [**3-13**]. He aggressively treated with IVF
early in his hospital course.  We maintained his UOP greater
than 100cc/h.  He then mobilized his third-spaced fluid and we
assisted with his diuresis.  The prolongation of his ventilatory
requirements was largely [**3-5**] elevated intraabdominal pressures
and significant pulmonary edema. PEG-J tube was placed by IR for
tube feeds. After extubation, he was started on POs which he
tolerated well with no increase in serum pancreatic enzymes.
Consider pancreatic enzyme replacement if develops steatorrhea.
A repeat abdominal CT scan was performed prior to discharge per
surgery. Followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks (he would like to
be called if not tolerating POs, develops abdominal pain, or
requires re-admission to the hospital).
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient was intubated on [**3-10**].
Given bilateral infiltrates seen on CXR, he was initially
ventilated under ARDS-net protocol with use of an esophageal
balloon pump to monitor pleural pressures and a triadyne bed for
rotational support.  His PEEP was initially high but we weaned
down gradually over the course of several weeks.  It was thought
that his PEEP requirements were [**3-5**] large abdominal girth from
third spacing.  This improved with diuresis and we weaned him
down to more typical vent settings. Received diamox transiently
for metabolic alkalosis. He also developed VAP and completed a 7
day course of vanc/cefepime with improvement in his secretions.
Noted to have wheezing and was given combivent inhalers and
nebulized steroids with improvement. Given the prolonged
intubation a tracheostomy was performed by thoracic surgery. He
was succesfully weaned off of the ventilator.
