Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with increasing respiratory distress
and was intubated. He then completed a seven day course of ABX
for CAP. A definite pathogen was not identified, but atypical
(possibly malignant vs premalignant) cells were seen in BAL
along with chest imaging revealing upper lung-zone infiltrates.
He improved from a respiratory standpoint and was weaned from
MV. He suffered several episdoes of new-onset AF/RVR in the
setting of his acute illness - a BB was added and titrated. Of
note, the patient had SBPs to the 200s upon extubation, but
otherwise tolerated it well. His BB and ACe-i were increased
accordingly. The patient's post-ICU course was complicated by
resolving confusion as well as an incidental upper GI bleed
(proven to be from PUD).

1. Resp Distress: The patient had an ICU MV/intubation course as
above. On admission, he leukocytosis, increased lactate, and
fever with multifocal PNA vs ARDS on CXR. His Chest CT showed
dense apical infiltrates of unclear etiology, but he did well on
CAP Rx (Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin). There was likely
underlying lung disease of unclear etiology contributing to his
clinical picture. His BAL was without organisms , but showed
atypical cells (see below). Amongst and after MV, he was
continued on Ipratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H:PRN and O2: by
the middle of his course (soon after transfer to the floor) he
was stable on room air and seemed comfortable. He was scheduled
for Pulmonary follow-up.

2. UGIB: Late in his course, the patient had asymptomatic
melena. He was consistently hemodynamically stable and c
omfortable. He had a positive NG lavage (red-brown, coffee
grounds) and a subsequent EGD showing a duodenal
clotted/bleeding ulcer and received cautery and local
epineprhine INJ. He received one unit of PRBC and was
hematocrit-stable thereafter. He was followed by the GI service
and was commenced on PPI [**Hospital1 **]. H. pylori antibodies were pending
on discharge.

3. Atypical Lung Cells: Upon BAL, abnormal cells were visualized
which were deemed likely mucinous metaplasia, but the low
possibility of mucinous adenocarcinoma existed. Pulmonary
follow-up and repeat imaging was arranged.

4. PAF: He had new onset PAF/RVR over this hospital course,
which was possibly related to the acute stress of infectiona and
resp distress. This initially manifested in the MICU, but he
then had brief bursts (3-5 seconds) of SVT vs PAF and sinus
tachycardia on the floor. He was continued BB, while monitoring
his PR prolongation. Anticoagulation was not started given the
fact this was a new-onset AF in the setting of acute illness and
his new UGIB. A possible Holter as outpatient after acute
stressors resolved was deferred to his PCP.

5. HTN: He was titrated on the following regimen for relatively
difficult to manage HTN: Lisinopril 40 mg PO DAILY, Metoprolol
37.5 mg PO TID, HCTZ 50 mg PO DAILY, and Amlodopine 5 mg PO
DAILY.

6. DMII: He was on FS QID with Insulin SC. He was controlled
with Metformin at home.

7. Enlarged Thyroid: An incidental heterogeneous thyroid with
coarse calcifications and associated adenopathy was seen on CT,
concerning for malignancy. His TFTs were  normal. An U/S showed
a large dominant nodule within the right lobe of the thyroid
gland (5.4 cm) and a heterogeneous appearance of the left lobe
of the gland. He was slotted to have outpatient endocrine
follow-up and a biopsy for a malignancy evaluation.
