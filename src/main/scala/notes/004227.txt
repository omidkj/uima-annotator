Service:  NEONATOLOGY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby girl [**Known lastname 32348**] [**Known lastname 40930**],
twin number two was born at 24 and 5/7 weeks gestation to a
40 year-old gravida 3 para 1 now 3 woman.  Her prenatal
screens were blood type A positive, antibody negative,
Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis surface antigen
obstetrical history is significant for a history of maternal
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4585**].  The first pregnancy went to term without any
complications.  The mother's past medical history is
remarkable for a congenital hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism and
hypercholesterolemia.  This pregnancy was conceived with
Clomid.  The mother was treated with cerclage placement at
eighteen weeks and then she presented at 22 weeks for
cervix and was placed on bed rest.  A course of betamethasone
was given and completed on [**2126-5-1**].  Rupture of membranes
occurred 24 hours prior to delivery and then the mother had a
fever to 100 and labor progressed and so a cesarean birth was
performed.  This infant emerged with good tone and activity,
spontaneous cry and respiratory effort.  Apgars were 7 at one
minute and 8 at five minutes.

The infant's birth weight was 640 grams, 30% percentile,
birth length was 30.5 cm, 15% percentile and head
circumference 20.5 cm 10th percentile for gestational age.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed an extremely
preterm infant.  Anterior fontanel soft and flat.  Palette
intact.  Nondysmorphic appearance.  Breath sounds tight with
moderate retractions, a grade 2/6 systolic murmur at the left
upper sternal border.  Pulses full.  Three vessel umbilical
cord.  No organomegaly.  Immature female genitalia and age
appropriate tone and reflexes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory status, the infant was
intubated at the time of delivery.  She received three doses
of Surfactant.  She successfully weaned to nasopharyngeal
continuous positive airway pressure on day of life 51 and
then weaned to nasal cannula oxygen on day of life 55.  On [**7-29**],
day 85 she weaned to room air.  At this stage she requires
approximately 75 cc/min flow with feeds.  She was treated with
caffeine citrate for apnea of prematurity from day of life five
until day of life 70.  Her apnea and bradycardia is very
infrequent at this stage.  On examination she has comfortable
respirations and her lung sounds are clear and equal.

Cardiovascular status, she required Dopamine for blood
pressure support for the first 36 hours of life and has
remained normotensive since that time.  She was treated with
Indocin for a clinical presentation of a patent ductus
arteriosus on day of life number one with resolution of the
symptoms.  She does continue to have an intermittent grade
1/6 systolic murmur consistent with flow murmur without any
hemodynamic significance.

Fluid, electrolyte and nutrition status, enteral feeds were
begun on day of life number four, but she was made NPO on day
of life number nine with the onset of sepsis.  She had
enteral feeds reinitiated on day of life number twenty four
and reached full volume feeds by day of life thirty and then
was advanced to 32 calories per ounce breast milk with added
ProMod.  Enteral feeds were again stopped on day of life
number forty two with a clinical presentation of sepsis.
They were restarted again on day of life forty four and to
reach full volume feeds on day of life forty eight and then
advanced to the present feeding plan of 30 calories per ounce
breast milk with added ProMod.  Total fluids are 150 cc per
kilogram per day and she is beginning to feed orally.  Her
last laboratories on [**2126-7-22**] were sodium 141, potassium 5.4,
chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, BUN 17 and creatinine 0.2,
calcium 10, phosphorus 5.8, albumin 3.5, alkaline phosphatase
492.  At the time of transfer her weight is 2475 grams,
length 43 cm and her head circumference 30.5 cm.

Gastrointestinal status, she was treated with phototherapy
for hyperbilirubinemia prematurity from day of life one until
day of life eleven.  Her peak bilirubin occurred on day of
life number one and was total 3.4, direct 0.2.  She has had
some intermittent dymotility with dilated loops of bowel
associated with her episodes of infection, but never any
evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis.

Hematological status, she was transfused a total of six times
of packed red blood cells.  The last transfusion occurred on
[**2126-6-16**].  Her last hematocrit of [**2126-7-22**] was 28.5 with a
reticulocyte count of 7.7%.  She is receiving supplemental
iron of 2 mg per kilogram per day in addition to her
feedings.  Her blood type is A positive, her direct Coombs is
negative.

Infectious disease status, she was started on Ampicillin and
Gentamycin for sepsis risk factors at the time of neonatal
Intensive Care Unit admission.  She completed seven days of
antibiotics for presumed sepsis.  Her blood and cerebral
spinal fluid cultures did remain negative.  On day of life
number nine she was started on Ampicillin, Gentamycin and
Cefotaxime for clinical presentation of E-coli sepsis.  She
completed a fourteen day course of Gentamycin and Cefotaxime.
A renal ultrasound on [**2126-5-27**] was completely within normal
limits.  She remained off antibiotics until day of life forty
two when she had a clinical decompensation and had
Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter diagnosed from her tracheal
aspirate.  She completed a fourteen day course of Gentamycin
and Meropenem.  Her blood and cerebral spinal fluid cultures
did remain negative.  She has remained off of antibiotics
since that time.

Neurological status, head ultrasound on [**4-18**] and [**6-5**]
are all within normal limits.  Her eyes were examined most
recently on [**2126-7-24**] revealing retinopathy of prematurity stage
one, six clock hours, zone two, O.U.  A follow up examination
is recommended for one week from that time.  Audiology,
hearing screen was performed with automated auditory brain
stem responses and the infant passed in both ears on [**2126-7-14**].

Psycho/social status, parents are married.  They have been
very involved in the infant's NICU care throughout the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay.  [**Known lastname 40933**] sibling [**Doctor First Name 1453**]
died at one week of age.  She had a diagnosis of trisomy 21.
Chromosomes were sent on [**Known lastname 32348**] and they were 46 XX.
