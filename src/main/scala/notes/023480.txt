HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 46**] is an 84-year-old
woman with a history of hypertension and hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, as well as an atrial arrhythmia requiring
placement of a pacemaker in [**2162**], who presented with a one
day history of generalized weakness and "feeling bad."
According to the patient, she did not have any pain or any
abnormal palpitations, but she did have some occasional chest
tightness and shortness of breath, mostly with exertion.
According to her family, she has had decreased appetite and
nausea for one to two days prior to presentation.  She denied
any nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or change in her bowel
habits.  She had no pain with inspiration and no hemoptysis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for atrial arrhythmia with
a DDI pacer with a rate of 70 paced in [**2162**], hypertension,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgitation and a ventral hernia.

MEDICATIONS:  Verapamil 240 mg a day, ranitidine 150 mg
b.i.d., Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone in [**Location (un) 86**] with a cat, but
has family near by; multiple daughters, and one son.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination shows a pleasant
woman lying in her gurney in no acute distress.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Mucous membranes were dry.  She had evidence of
bilateral cataract surgery.  There was no lymphadenopathy in
her neck.  Her neck was supple.  There was no jugular venous
distention. Her heart had a 2/6 systolic murmur in the upper
left sternal border.  No rubs or gallops and the rate and
rhythm were regular.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender and
nondistended with normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants.
Extremities had strong dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally
without any edema.  Rectal exam was performed showing guaiac
negative brown stool.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  White blood cell count 7.6,
hematocrit 37.8, platelet count 327,000.  Serum chemistries
were notable for a BUN of 29 and a creatinine of 1.4.  Chest
x-ray showed no change from prior x-ray and no acute
infiltrate or effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Cardiac Medicine
Team and placed on telemetry to rule out myocardial
infarction.  Multiple sets of CK enzymes and troponins were
normal.  Her initial electrocardiogram showed a paced atrial
rhythm with normal QRS with a small S wave in lead I and a
small Q wave in lead III.  On the telemetry, there were no
events overnight and the following day, the Electrophysiology
Team was requested to interrogate her pacemaker and found
that her pacer was functioning normally.

After this, she had an echocardiogram which revealed
significant elevation in right-sided in pulmonary artery
pressures with right ventricular dilatation and tricuspid
regurgitation.  Immediately after the echocardiogram, she was
noted to be hypotensive.  She was then, because of a
suspicion of a pulmonary embolism, she underwent a CT
angiogram of the lungs which showed a large pulmonary embolus
in the right main pulmonary artery, as well as some extending
into the left pulmonary artery.  Immediately after this, the
patient was taken to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and
intravenous access was established in order to initiate TPA
therapy.  Immediately after the first dose of TPA, she
developed significant hematomas in her right neck and groin
at the site of attempted central line placement.  The TPA was
then stopped, and heparin was started instead.

While she was observed in the Medical Intensive Care Unit,
she did not have evidence of respiratory distress, and her
blood pressure was managed with intravenous fluids.  On
[**2172-7-17**], her hematocrit was noted to decline to a
level of 29.
