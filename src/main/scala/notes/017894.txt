Brief Hospital Course:
1. The patient had a CXR suggestive of a LLL PNA, although it
was unclear if this was a new process or a persistent old
process. Sputum showed 3+GPC in pairs and clusters, and
sensitivity showed MRSA. Blood cultures also grew MRSA. She was
started on vancomycin on [**2183-8-23**], for a 14 day course. (Day of
discharge is day 5 of 14 days.) At the time of discharge, the
patient had been afebrile for several days.

2. Trach stoma infection/cellulitis. MRSA was grown from trach
site and the patient was placed on vancomycin as above. Her
trach was replaced on [**2183-8-26**] with improved fit.

3. The patient had a Foley catheter-related UTI. Her Foley was
changed, and acinetobacter (pan sensitive) and enterococcus
(sensitivities pending) was treated with ciprofloxacin, in
addition to the vancomycin, for a 14 day course. On the day of
discharge she was on day 3 of a 14 day course of ciproflox.

4. Abd pain was of unclear etiology, possibly a resolved partial
SBO. The patient did not complain of abdominal pain during her
admission. Tube feeds were restarted, which she tolerated well.


5. GI: Intermittent diarrhea. C. diff was negative. Lactulose
was stopped while the patient had diarrhea.

6. Chest pain: Had very brief episode of CP on [**8-24**] evening -->
EKG neg, enzymes neg.  No interventions done.

7. A right shoulder anterior dislocation was seen on CXR. Ortho
was consulted and recommended a splint for comfort.

8. Multiple foley catheters were placed during the patient's
stay due to poor fit, the most recent on [**2183-8-26**]. She began to
have hematuria after this placement, likely due to foley trauma.
On [**2183-8-27**], the hematuria began to worsen, and SQ heparin was
held while bleeding. The hematuria improved.

9. Lines: PIV. PICC line placed ([**8-27**]).

10. Prophylaxis: heparin SC (held on [**2183-8-27**]), PPI, compression
stockings.
