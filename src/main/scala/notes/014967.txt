Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Cystoscopy, right retrograde pyelogram, and right ureteral
stent placement on [**6-19**]
-Intubated and sedated from [**6-19**] to [**6-27**]


History of Present Illness:
73 yo F h/o CNS lymphoma, h/o CVA, afib, CHF, OSA presented with
nausea, vomitting, dyspnea and abdominal pain to the ER. Patient
was in discomfort, but apparently could not localize where pain
was originating. She was felt to be somewhat disoriented at this
time, but this is not documented in the ED notes.
.
In the ED, she was febrile to 101.2 and treated with vancomycin
1 g and Pip/Tazo 4.5 g. She was also given 650 mg po tylenol.
Workup included CT abdomen/pelvis which revealed a 7 mm
obstructing stone in the right ureter, with a UA significant
only for many bacteria. Urology was consulted re: the
obstructing stone, and they advised consulting IR for
percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. IR was consulted and decided
patient was not a candidate for perc tubes because of her body
habitus. CXR revealed a RML opacity and she was given combivent
nebs and solumedrol 125 mg IV x1. Patient subsequently developed
hypoxic respiratory failure while in CT, with desaturation to
the 70s. She improved to the 80s on a NRB. At this time, her
mental status apparently improved but she was intubated for her
respiratory distress. She placed on Bipap during the interim,
and eventually intubated. Post intubation ABG was 7.21/37/75/16.
Saturations remained in the high 80s despite FiO2 100%, so
patient was given 20 mg IV lasix and PEEP was increased from 10
to 15. Saturations transiently improved to the 90s, but them
went back to 80s so she was given vecuronium 10 mg prior to
transfer. On transfer VS were 114, 144/69, sat 88%.
.
In the ICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

Pertinent Results:
[**6-19**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Diffuse repolarization changes that are non-specific. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2205-2-26**] there is no significant
diagnostic change.
.
[**6-19**] CT head without contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. No CT evidence of recurrence of tumor.
.
[**6-19**] CXR: FINDINGS: Lung volumes are diminished. Mild hazy
opacity is noted over the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with
atelectasis. There is an indwelling left subclavian Port-A-Cath,
with the catheter tip projecting over the area of the superior
cavoatrial junction. There is mild aortic tortuosity. The
cardiac silhouette size is difficult to truly assess, but is
likely at least borderline enlarged. No definite effusion or
pneumothorax is noted.  Degenerative changes are noted
throughout the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute pulmonary process.
.
[**6-19**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. 7-mm obstructive renal stone within the right proximal ureter
with
associated moderate hydronephrosis, periureteric and
perinephritic stranding.  Perinephric fluid is concerning for
forniceal rupture.
2. Unchanged left medial limb adrenal hyperplasia.
3. Unchanged pneumobilia.
4. Stable hypodensity in the upper pole of the right kidney.
.
[**6-20**] ECHO: The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate LVH with hyperdynamic LV systolic function.
Dilated and hypokinetic RV. Mild mitral and moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 73 year old female with PMH of CNS lymphoma, history
of CVA, atrial fibrillation/flutter, diastolic CHF, and OSA who
presented with nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and abdominal pain and
found to have obstructive nephrolithiasis and Klebsiella
bacteremia/sepsis.
.
#. Klebsiella Sepsis/Obstructive nephrolithiasis.  The patient
was found to have an obstructing 7mm right ureteral stone and a
right middle lobe lung opacity.  In the ED, the patient rapidly
developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and MICU
admission.  For the obstructing stone, the patient underwent
placement of a ureteral stent by urology and will have the stent
removed in a month at an outpatient urology appointment.  She
was growing Klebsiella in her blood and urine culture on
admission.  She cleared her subsequent blood cultures with
appropriate antibiotic treatment.  The patient was initially
treated with meropenem, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin, narrowed
to just ciprofloxacin on [**2205-6-22**] when the patient's urine grew
pan-sensit
