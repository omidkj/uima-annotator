History of Present Illness:
This 78 year old white female presented in late [**Month (only) **] with an
acute infarction and undewrwent catheterization, angioplasty and
drug eluting stent to the right coronary artery.  She was found
to have a ventricular septal defect with left to right shunting
on echocardiogram.  She was assymptomatic and was sent to rehab
after discharge, having been consulted by the cardiac surgical
service.

She continued to fail, with significant lower extremity edema
and weakness.  She was admitted now for repair of the defect.

INTRAOPERATIVE TEE: [**2139-9-23**]

PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
There is a post-infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD) at
the basal infero-septal wall measuring 1.3 cm. Color flow
doppler demonstrates a significant left to right shunt.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
annulus is 3.8 cm.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time
of surgery.

POST-BYPASS:
The patient is status post VSD repair. The patient is on an
epinephrine infusion and is AV paced.
This is a technically suboptimal study.
There is an echogenic density at the site of the previous VSD
likely representing a patch repair. There is no blood flow
across the patch. There does appear to be a small jet by color
flow Doppler from the LV outflow tract into the RV.
The left ventricular function is preserved. Right ventricular
function appears moderately depressed.
Mitral regurgitation is unchanged.
Tricuspid regurgitation is moderate (2+).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. No aortic stenosis is seen.
The ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta are
intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Following same day admission she was taken to the Operating Room
where the defect was repaired using a Dacron patch on the
muscular septum.  She was weaned from bypass on Epinephrine and
TEE revealed no residual defect as well as minimal tricuspid and
mitral regurgitation and the valves were left untouched.

After transfer to the CVICU she required a moderate amount of
volume resuscitation and awoke intact.  She was subsequently
extubated.

 She became hemodynamically unstable and progressively acidotic.
Cardiac catheterization was performed on [**9-25**] demonstrating
patent grafts and an intra aortic balloon was placed.
Exploratory laparotomy was performed which reveaed low flow
ischemic small bowel.  She was resuscitated and prerssors
resumed.  Her renal function deteriorated and CVVH was
instituted on [**9-26**].  She developed ischemic feet and hands with
sloughing of skin and coldness.

The balloon pump was removed.  She remained in multisystem organ
fsailure on multiple pressors.  Family meetings were held and on
[**10-1**] a DNR staus was begun.  In keeping with family wishes she
was made CMO on the 26th. She was extubated and all pressors
discontionued.  With the family at bedside, she expired at 15:08
on [**2139-10-2**].
