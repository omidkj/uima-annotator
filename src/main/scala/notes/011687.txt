History of Present Illness:
44 yo male with HCV (VL 37,000), HIV (CD4 of 284, VL<50),
previously on liver transplant list, DM2, ESLD, secondary
polycythemia, and hepatopulmonary syndrome who presented
initially with fevers/chills to 103.5.
Patient states that in the last two weeks, he [**Known lastname **] had myalgias,
rhinorrhea, and fatigue, as well as low grade fevers. Over the
course of the last day, he developed acute worsening of his
symptoms, with associated abdominal bloating, abdominal pain,
profuse diarrhea and emesis, as well as high fevers to 103-104.
Patient states that he had a less severe episode last year,
which resolved with outpatient antibiotics.
Patient denies neck stiffness, headache, photophobia, chest pain
except in the context of anxiety, trouble breathing, sputum
production, hemoptysis, hematuria, dysuria, or blood in stool.
.
At OSH, patient was noted to have 26% bandemia. In the ED,
patient complained of RUQ tenderness, and had bedside ultrasound
which showed gallstones. patient with SBPs 79/42 with HR of 103,
O2 sats in 88 on RA, 93% 4L. Patient had LSC placed and code
sepsis was initiation. Patient was given levo, flagyl and
ceftazidime and placed on a levophed gtt. Patient also had
arterial line placed, and LP performed.


Past Medical History:
1. Chronic hepatitis C genotype 1, biopsy proven cirrhosis
([**2107**]) s/p interferon and ribavarin therapy for 48 weeks
([**Date range (1) 17637**]). Initially with SVR then with relapse after [**4-11**]
months. HCV VL 502,000 [**6-12**]. - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**], recently
off the transplant list (since [**2117-6-8**] ) due to concurrent
marihuana use, unresolved medical problems.
2. HIV (dx [**2107**]) last CD4 = 284 ([**5-15**]) viral load = < 50 ([**5-15**])
No history of OI. - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
3. DM (dx [**5-12**]) thought due to pegIFN. Did not tolerate oral
hypoglycemics, on insulin. - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9978**]
4. Hypothryoidism [**5-12**]
5. Grade I varices and portal gastropathy [**7-13**]
6. Cholestatic jaundice thought to be due to glipizide
7. Hepatitis B with undetectable VL.
8. Hyperthyroidism, briefly on PTU-thought to be due to pegIFN
9. Hypoxemia/home O2 - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**] -
hepatopulmonary syndrome, parenchymal lung disease related to
his smoking, or an intracardiac shunt. on 2L NC at home
10. Mild pulmonary HTN on Echo
11. Recent PFTs [**5-15**] - subtle obstructive defect and a mild
reduction in his diffusing capacity
12. [**5-15**] Bubble Echo - showed delayed bubble entry into [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/w
pulmonary shunt.
13. Marihuana use - due to anxiety and poor appetite per patient

14. Secondary Polycythemia - followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**], elevated
EPO, elevated iron, ferritin - ? due to hepatoma vs renal cell
Ca.
15. L cheek swelling - ? due to parotid gland
obstruction/infection.

.
EKG: NSR.
CXR 5/15a: Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis. No
pneumonia or CHF.
.
Abdominal ultrasound [**6-22**]:
COMPARISON: [**2116-10-27**].

FINDINGS: Nodular hepatic contour and coarsened echotexture is
again consistent with cirrhosis. Perihepatic ascites is noted
with extension of fluid into the gallbladder bed. Previously
noted lesion within the left lobe of the liver is not evaluated
on this limited bedside evaluation. No stones are identified
within the gallbladder with mild-to-moderate gallbladder wall
thickening, likely secondary to underlying cirrhosis. No intra-
or extra- hepatic ductal dilatation is seen. The aorta is of
normal caliber. The right kidney measures 10.5 cm. The left
kidney measures 12.0 cm. No focal renal lesion nor
hydronephrosis seen. Previously identified left renal cyst is
not identified today. Splenomegaly with varices at the splenic
hilum again seen.

The main portal vein, its branches, and the hepatic vein and its
branches, and the hepatic artery and its branches are patent
with appropriate directionality of flow. Mild slowing of flow
within the hepatic veins is suggestin, but unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis with ascites. Focal hepatic lesion not evaluated
today.
2. Splenomegaly with splenic varices.
3. Patent hepatic vessels.
.
CXR 5/15b: No acute change from above.

Echo [**2117-6-25**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular  systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and  free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally  normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral  valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.  The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no  pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2117-6-27**]:
In comparison to the prior day study, the position of both the
endotracheal and nasogastric tubes [**Known lastname **] been optimized and both
tubes are now in satisfactory position. Otherwise, no new
support tubes or lines have been introduced. There [**Known lastname **] been a
redistribution of the diffuse interstitial and alveolar
edema-like pattern. There is marked improvement in the right
perihilar region and decrease in the edema of the right lower
lobe. There [**Known lastname **] however been increased density of the large
opacity of the left lower lung and worsening edema in the left
upper lung as well. No definite effusions are noted, there is no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: As above, there [**Known lastname **] been a redistribution of the
edema in this ARDS pattern. Endotracheal and nasogastric tube
positions have been optimized.
