HOSPITAL COURSE:

Pulmonary:  The patient was intubated for respiratory failure
thought to be secondary to narcotic overdose.  He was able to
be weaned off the vent and extubated later that day.
Eventually, his 02 requirement diminished so that he was in
the mid to low 90s on four liters of nasal cannula at his
baseline.  Patient continued to have a productive cough and a
chest x-ray suggested bilateral aspiration pneumonia.  He was
put on ceftazidime and Flagyl, to cover a Pseudomonas that
was grown from his sputum culture on his previous admission
earlier this month.  He should continue on ceftazidime and
Flagyl for a two week course.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Patient with borderline low blood
pressure.   He was started on methedrine 2.5 one hour before
hemodialysis.  He was not restarted on beta-blocker, ACE
inhibitor at this time because his blood pressure was not
high enough to tolerate.

3.  Renal:  Patient continued on hemodialysis, Tuesday,
Thursday and Friday's without complications.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient's Synthroid was increased to 50
mcg q.d.

5.  Pain management:  The patient was weaned to 40 mg a day
of methadone.  He should remain on this dose for about two
weeks and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding a further
taper of this.  He is written for Percocet prn for
breakthrough pain.  He was given a prescription for a one
months supply at 1 tablet t.i.d. prn.

6.  Infectious Disease:  Please note, in addition for
Infectious Disease, the patient had a positive blood culture
on [**5-8**], 1/2 bottles, the aerobic bottle was growing gram
positive rods.  The speciation is not known at time of
dictation.  He had repeat blood cultures drawn and these are
still pending.  These results should be follow-up by the
patient's PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] antibiotics should be changed to cover
any new organisms if any should arise.  It was thought these
were most likely contaminant, so the patient's discharge was
not held up because of that.
