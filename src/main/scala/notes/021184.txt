[**6-8**] cxr:
IMPRESSION: Appearance of partial right upper lobe lung collapse
with associated volume loss and tracheal deviation to the right.
A chest CT is recommended to further evaluate this finding.
Enlarged left hilum and foci of air within the right apex could
reflect an underlying infectious process such as tuberculosis or
fungal infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o male with a h/o asthma who presented to the ED with the
acute onset of facial swelling.
.
# Facial swelling: The patient presented with mild angioedema
that was attributed to his lisinopril use.  His ace inhibitiors
were stopped and he was treated with prednisone, Ranitidine and
Diphenhydramine. His facial swelling improved and he had no
evidence of airway compromise in the MICU.  He was stable at
discharge and will complete a steroid taper.  He will need to
avoid ace inhibitors as an outpatient
.
# Asthma: The patient has chronic asthma and was weaned off
oxygen in the micu without signs of asthma exacerbation.  He did
well with prn nebulizers and was stable at discharge.  He will
complete a steroid taper and will take albuterol prn and
standing atrovent as an outpatient.  He should be closely
monitored for his asthma as an outpatient and would likely
benefit from a pulmonary follow-up in the future.
.
# Hypertension: The patient was controlled on amlodopine and
this was titrated up prior to discharge for optimal control.
The patient should continue to have his blood pressure monitored
as an outpatient.
.
# partial collapse of the right upper lobe: The patient had an
abnormal cxr, and the findings were thought to be chronic.  The
patient should have this finding pursued as an outpatient and
will likely benefit from an outpatient CT scan.
