Brief Hospital Course:
During [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, pt was initially on 95% face mask, which was
titrated to 5L NC. Hypoxia was thought to be multifactorial
secondary to COPD exacerbation, aggressive IVF hydration, ?CHF
in setting of IVF. However, echo and MUGA showed EF 61% with
moderate pulm art systolic htn. Pt was given nebs, steroids for
tx of COPD. Pt was concurrently given IVF hydration and Lasix
for diuresis for CHF.
.
Pt presented with acute renal failure thought secondary to uric
acid nephropathy vs. rhabdomyalysis. Was given IVF with bicarb.
Had tn leak, likely on setting of renal failure.
.
Etiology of initial presentation of left leg pain was not found.
Pt had no evidence of neurologic compromise and leg pain
improved. No imaging was performed.
.
After improvement of pt's respiratory status, he was transferred
to the floor for further management of the following issues:
.
1. Hypoxia: Pt's hypoxia is most likely multifactorial in
etiology secondary to COPD exacerbation, CHF in the secondary of
aggressive IVF, and possible underlying OSA. Pt diuresed well on
IV Lasix. Serial CXR showed improvement in bilateral pleural
effusions. CXR did not show any evidence of pneumonia; there was
no clinical evidence of pneumonia. Pt was treated for COPD
exacerbation on steroids, standing albuterol and atrovent nebs,
and azithromycin. Pt was switched to oral prednison on arrival
to the floor; he is to complete a slow taper. Pt was continued
on oxygen supplementation with a goal O2 level ot 90-92%. Pt had
evidence of moderate pulmonary hypertension on echo, which may
be secondary to left heart failure (perhaps diastolic, since the
echo showed preserved EF). However, given the pt's body habitus,
we would recommend an outpatient sleep study to look for OSA.
.
2. Heme/Onc - After serial cbc/differential, it was felt that pt
has MDS with blasts secondary to reactive marrow. Pt has 15%
blasts on his bone marrow biopsy, which does not quality for
acute leukemia. Also, he showed evidence of steadily decreasing
blast count on serial differentials. Pt should have his MDS and
blast count closely followed by an outpatient
hematology/oncologist to look for acute leukemic transformation.
Pt was transiently neutropenic, but then recovered his counts.
Pt was admitted with a signficantly elevated uric acid level,
LDH in the setting of hemolysis for which he was given IV
hydration and allopurinol with subsequent normalization. Pt was
noted to have steadily decreasing platelet counts. The
differential for pt's thrombocytopenia included MDS, HIT, less
likely drug related (on Lasix). Pt's anticoagulants (plavix,
aspirin) were held.  No evidence of DIC; HIT antibody is
pending.

.
3. Renal Failure: Pt was admitted in acute renal failure thought
to be secondary to uric acid nephropathy. Less likely etiology
is rhabdomyalysis (peak of 1500).  Resolved with IV hydration
and allopurinol.
.
4. CV: No active issues. Pt was ruled out for MI. Aspirin was
held in setting of low plt and increased INR. Pt was continued
on lopressor, lipitor, isordil, amlodipine, and lisinopril
.
5. Leg Pain - Initial concern for nerve compression or blastoma.
However, pain resolved without intervention or need for imaging.
.
6. Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. CK peaked at 1525. CK
normalized with IV hydration.
