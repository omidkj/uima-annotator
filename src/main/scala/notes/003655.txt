Date of Birth:  [**2098-8-2**]             Sex:   M

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Benzodiazepines / Terazosin Hcl / Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3283**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF exacerbation and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation
PICC placement, removal
Right subclavian line
Hemodialysis
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 year old Polish speaking man with a history
of diastolic CHF (EF 65% in [**6-24**]), atrial fibrillation (refusing
anticoagulation), HTN, DM, CRI who presented with pitting edema
and shortness of breath on [**2177-11-24**].  Per nursing home notes,
patient's weight had increased 15 pounds from his baseline (dry
weight 265).  Prior to early [**Month (only) **], patient's urine output
was approximately 3-4 liters per day, but had dropped to less
than one liter per day, despite lasix dose of 60mg [**Hospital1 **] not
changing.
.
In the ED, diuresis was tried with 120mg IV lasix and 250mg
diuril.  A COPD flare was suspected and IV solumedrol 80mg and
azithromycin 500mg was started.  Levofloxacin 250 mg IV was
added for a positive UA.  As the patient's ABG was 7.25/70/242,
Bipap was started and the patient was transferred to the MICU.


Past Medical History:
-Atrial fibrillation: not on anticoagulation because of lack of
adherence
-Coronary artery disease: refused catheterization
-CHF (diastolic dysfunction with last EF 65% on echo [**6-24**], dry
wt 125kg)
-CRI (baseline Cr 2.7)
-BPH
-HTN
-DM (diet controlled)
-OSA - pulmonary HTN, requiring supplemental night oxygen and
BIPAP before intubation
-Anemia (baseline hematocrit 23-27)


Social History:
Married, lives with daugther. Wife lives at [**Hospital1 1501**]. Polish speaking
but understands some English. Per pt's daughter (who is
researcher at [**Hospital1 18**]) no tobacco, alcohol or other drugs; stopped
smoking 40yrs ago (smoked a lot while being captain on a ship)

STUDIES:
Chest Xray([**2177-11-24**]):  Very limited radiograph, small bilateral
pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema cannot be excluded.
PA and lateral radiographs with improved suspension of
respiration is recommended, if feasible.
.
Chest Xray([**2177-11-28**]):  There has been interval placement of a
right IJ CVL with the tip extending to the cavoatrial junction.
Cardiomegaly is stable.  Perihilar interstitial opacities have
improved in the interval, compatible with improving pulmonary
edema.  There are likely bilateral pleural effusions, although
the study of limited secondary to patient's body habitus.
.
Chest Xray([**2177-12-4**]): 1. Standard ET tube placement. 2.
Cardiomegaly with no evidence of congestive heart failure on the
current
chest radiograph.  Bilateral atelectasis right more than left,
right pleural effusion.
.
Chest Xray([**2177-12-10**]): 1.  Persistent failure and bilateral
pleural effusions. 2.  Tip of the nasogastric tube not
visualized, but below the level of the diaphragm.
.
PICC placement ([**2177-12-12**]):  Successful placement of a 40-cm 4
French single lumen PICC via the right brachial vein.  The tip
is in the central superior vena cava.  The line is ready for
use.
.
Brain MRI ([**2177-12-13**]):  No evidence of acute infarct.  Moderate
brain and medial temporal atrophy.  Moderate small vessel
disease.
.
Temporary Catheter Placement([**2177-11-27**]):  Uncomplicated ultrasound
and fluoroscopically guided temporary dialysis catheter
placement via the right internal jugular venous approach with
the tip in the right atrium.
.
Chest Xray [**12-19**]: IMPRESSION: Improvement in the appearance of
the previously described cardiac failure and bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
Abdominal CT: [**12-26**]
1. Malpositioned Foley catheter; the balloon is inflated within
the penile urethra.
2. Moderate left hydroureteronephrosis to the level of the left
ureteovesicular junction without a clear obstructing lesion. No
stones are identified within the ureter or bladder.
3. No evidence for diverticulosis or diverticulitis.
.
Echo: [**12-31**]
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is
