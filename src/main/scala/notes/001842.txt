History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 year old female who underwent a mechanical aortic
valve replacement, replacement of ascending aorta and myomectomy
in [**2156-5-19**]. She recently was hospitalized for congestive heart
failure. Workup was notable for severe tricuspid regurgitation,
mild aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, and normal
LVEF. Cardiac catheterization in [**2168-1-20**] showed normal
coronary arteries. Based upon the above results, she was
referred for cardiac surgical intervention. Since her
hospitalization, she has been placed on Lasix with improvement
in symptoms. At the time of this admission, she denied chest
pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND and pedal edema. She
was also recently treated with Amoxicillin for community
acquired pneumonia. A follow up chest x-ray from [**2168-3-19**]
confirmed improving right lower lobe pneumonia. She currently
denies fevers, chills and  rigors. She admits to improving cough
of only white sputum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 65582**] was admitted several days prior to surgery for
routine preoperative evaluation and heparinization. Workup was
unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery. On [**4-21**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed a redo sternotomy and a tricuspid valve
replacement utilizing a 29mm pericardial valve. The operation
was uneventful and she transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition. On postoperative day one, she was noted to have a
leukocytosis with significant elevation in lactate and bilirubin
levels. Some RUQ abdominal tenderness was concomitantly noted. A
RUQ ultrasound found no focal liver lesions or biliary
dilatation. Subsequent CT scan revealed findings consistent with
colitis involving the right colon and proximal transverse colon.
She was empirically started on broad spectrum antibiotics and
transplant surgery was consulted for exploratory laparoscopy.
Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed on [**4-22**]. The mesentery,
gall bladder, bowel and appendix all appeared normal. The liver
appeared cirrhotic, micronodular. She returned to the CSRU in
stable condition. Over several days, she made clinical
improvements. Her white count, lactate and LFTs improved. She
was eventually extubated and weaned from inotropic support.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were continued. C. Diff cultures were
checked and remained negative. She otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
four. She intermittently required Haldol for confusion. By
discharge, her mental status completely returned to baseline.
Warfarin was resumed for her prior mechanical AVR and dosed for
a goal INR between 2.0 - 3.0. Heparin was transiently required
for some time for a sub therapeutic prothrombin time. She
continued to have elevated bilirubin levels for which the
hepatology service was consulted. Lactate and total bilirubin
levels peaked to 687 and 10.6 respectively. She progressively
became jaundiced and started on Ursodiol for cholestasis, the
most likely etiology for elevated bilirubin levels. The
micronodular liver was attributed to right sided congestive
heart failure. Over her hospital stay, her total bilirubin
eventually improved to 5.3. The remainder of her LFTs were
stable and essentially remained normal except for her LDH. The
ID service was also consulted for a persistent leukocytosis. Her
white count remained mostly remained in the 20K range. During
her hospital stay, she remained afebrile. Broad spectrum
antibiotics were empirically continued for a total of 10 day
course. The leukocytosis was attributed to postop pleural
effusions with bilateral upper lobe pneumonia which was
confirmed by chest CT scan. On [**5-3**], left sided
thoracentesis was performed without complication. Approximately
one liter of bloody fluid was drained. Her white count gradually
improved. Serial chest x-rays showed improvement in pleural
effusions. Chest x-rays were also notable for a persistent
finding of a retrosternal opacity corresponding to fluid
collection on recent CT which remained stable in appearance -
most likely mediastinal hematoma. The remainder of her hospital
course was uneventful. She remained mostly in a normal sinus
rhythm with only intermittent atrial arrhythmias and continued
to maintain stable hemodynamics. She was stabilized on medical
therapy and continued to make clinical improvements with
diuresis. She worked daily with physical therapy and continued
to make steady progress. She was eventually cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day 18.
