Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yom w/ CAD s/p CABG and stenting, diastolic
dysfunction, with multiple admissions for pneumonia, pleural
effusions and empyemas who was admitted to ICU for hypotension
and hypoxic respiratory distress. Patient developed acute
shortness of breath, unproductive cough, and fever that began
earlier this evening. He has dyspnea on exertion at baseline,
but does not require home O2. Patient has had difficulty with
thin liquids in past resulting in reported aspiration pneumonia.
His last choking episode was over 2 weeks ago. He also reports
some middle back pain which had started over the weekend, and
was worse when walking per patient. Patient currently denies any
back pain. He has not had any chest pain, recent illness or
trauma. He denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Of note, patient has been "unsteady" for past few weeks with
walker at home. Last BM was [**11-1**], and was normal.

Patient was 92% on RA when seen by EMS and started on 2L NC.

Preliminary Reportgreater than right basilar atelectasis.

MRI T-spine
THORACIC SPINE:  The thoracic spinal canal is capacious.  The
thoracic spinal cord is normal in signal intensity and
morphology.  There are no significant degenerative changes in
the thoracic spine.  There is no abnormal enhancement to suggest
epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, discitis or metastasis.  There
are several T1-bright and T2-bright lesions in the vertebral
bodies, compatible with benign intraosseous hemangiomas.

The cervical spine is only partially visualized, which
demonstrates various degrees of disc bulges and spinal canal
narrowing, but no evidence of infection or metastasis.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of infection or metastasis.  Multiple
intraosseous
hemangiomas.

Echo [**11-2**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal basal
inferior hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2169-8-15**], mild regional LV systolic dysfunction
is apparent. The other findings appear similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yom w/ CAD, diastolic dysfunction, hx
multiple admissions for pneumonia, pleural effusions and
empyemas presenting with acute onset shortness of breath and
fever with mild leukocytosis and CXR without focal opacity
admitted to MICU for hypoxic respiratory distress concerning for
pneumonia, later transferred to CCU for NSTEMI which was likely
due to demand in setting acute illness.

Acute issues:

# Hypotension: Concern for sepsis initially, with concern for
pulmonary source given pt was complaining of cough and dyspnea,
however no focal infiltrate on CXR. Pt was admitted to the MICU
and required no pressors. He was volume-resuscitated and started
on Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin initially for community-acquired
PNA. Cultures were sent and there has been no growth to date.
Given pt's acute onset back pain, epidural abscess vs
osteomyelitis was also considered. ESR and CRP were elevated.
MRI showed no osteomyelitis or epidural abscess; just revealed
multiple intraossesous hemangiomas.
TTE showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
consistent with CAD. This finding was expected given known
inferior wall disease on previous P-MIBI study (fixed defect
inferiorly) and occluded SVG-PDA during [**2164**] cath study.
Pt's troponins found to be elevated and uptrending and was
transferred to the CCU for further workup and management of
presumed NSTEMI. Pt was received by CCU team on HD1 with pt on
heparin gtt, statin, and beta blocker. Pt remained
hemodynamically stable during stay in CCU without pressors. In
addition, antibiotics were stopped on HD2 as leukocytosis
resolved, pt remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable and
demonstrated no source of infection.

#NSTEMI: Troponins elevated to peak of 1.2, likely due to demand
NSTEMI in setting of acute hypotension. Troponins were elevated
and intially uptrending. Patient started on heparin drip and
transferred to the CCU. Troponins stabilized and trended down,
and patient was persistantly asymptomatic. He remained
hemodynamically stable after transfer to the CCU and serial ECGs
