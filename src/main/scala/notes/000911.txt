Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Elongated LA. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA. No
mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. PFO
is present. Left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum at
rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV
cavity size. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall
normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal
aortic arch diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA
<0.8cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
No MVP. Severe mitral annular calcification. Severe thickening
of mitral valve chordae. Mild valvular MS (MVA 1.5-2.0cm2).
Moderate to severe (3+) MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] vena contracta is >=0.7cm

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Moderate
to severe [3+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears
to be A-V paced. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is > 20 cm/s. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. The non-coronary cusp is
immobilized. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The posterior mitral valve leaflet is
severely thickened, calcified, and immobilized. The anterior
mitral valve leaflet is moderately thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification.
There is thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the operating
room at the time of the study.

POST CPB Normal biventricular systolic function. There is a
bioprosthesis in the aortic position. It is well seated. The
leaflets are not seen. There is trace aortic regurgitation the
source of which can not be determined. The mean pressure
gradient across the aortic valve is about 20 mm Hg with a
maximum gradient of about 30 mm Hg. A tricuspid valve
annuloplasty ring is in situ but not well seen. There is trace
tricuspid regurgitation. There is some improvement in the mitral
regurgitation, now moderate. The thoracic aorta appears intact.
The PFO remains visible with left to right flow.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
