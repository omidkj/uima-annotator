CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluation for effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
44 year old man s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 74870**], MV repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluation for effusions
STUDY: PA and lateral, [**2102-10-8**].

HISTORY: 44-year-old man with mitral valve repair.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2102-10-4**].

Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed. Median sternotomy wires and
valve prosthesis is again seen. There is unchanged left-sided
pleural effusion. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema.
A small right-sided pleural effusion is also seen.

Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity. Severely depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Moderate global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Markedly dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma
in descending aorta. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal arch
coarctation.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Moderate to severe (3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Eccentric
MR jet. Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. The aortic root is markedly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Pulse wave of the pulmonary veins demonstrates systolic
reversal.

POST-BYPASS:
Pt removed from cardiopulmonary bypass on milrinone, epinephrine
and phenylephrine infusion and AV paced.
1. Biventricular function is unchanged at LVEF of [**8-28**]% with
noted dysynchrony.
2. Pt s/p mitral valve annuloplasty; there in no mitral
regurgitation. Mean gradient across the valve is 2.3mmHg. Mitral
valve area is 2.6 cm2.
3. An aortic mechanical prosthetic valve is noted in the aortic
position. The valve is well seated with good leaflet excursion.
There is no [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 17008**] [**Last Name (un) **] or aortic regurgitation. Mean
gradient across the valve is 6mmHg.
4. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.
1. Biventricular fu
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
