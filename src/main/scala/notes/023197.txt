Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84 year old
male with a past medical history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, known coronary artery disease, and
aortic stenosis, status post a coronary artery bypass graft
in [**2122**], secondary to three vessel disease, who presented
with increased shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion
times several months.  He denied paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  There was increased orthopnea and peripheral edema.
He denied chest pain or palpitations.  The patient had an
echocardiogram in [**2127-7-4**], which was done as part of
aortic stenosis screening, which revealed mild left
ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of 60%, with
transvalvular mean pressure of 65 and aortic valve area of
0.45.  Repeat echocardiogram on [**2127-10-17**], revealed dilated
left atrium and right atrium, ejection fraction of 55%, mean
gradient of 92 and a valve area of 0.5 centimeter squared.
Due to these symptoms and aortic stenosis, the patient was
referred for cardiac catheterization, which he underwent on
[**2127-1-19**], which revealed an aortic valve gradient of 35.8 and
a valve area of 0.64.  Additionally, the catheterization
revealed his native three vessel disease and additionally an
occlusion of the left anterior descending distal to the
touchdown of his saphenous vein graft and an 80% stenosis in
the proximal obtuse marginal three.  The patient was admitted
to the CCU for observation and diuresis, as well as workup
for possible redo coronary artery bypass graft/aortic valve
replacement.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

4.  Lipitor 20 mg once daily.
5.  Coumadin 6 mg Monday, Wednesday and Friday and 4 mg other
days.
6.  Folic Acid 1 mg once daily.
7.  Tylenol 650 mg q4hours.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, heart rate was 76, blood
pressure 149/85, oxygen saturation 99% in room air.  In
general, the patient was in no acute distress.  The
oropharynx was moist.  Elevated jugular venous pressure to
the angle of the jaw.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2, no S3 and no S4.  There was a II/VI
crescendo decrescendo murmur at the right upper sternal
border.  The extremities showed chronic venous stasis
changes.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.

LABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 70 beats per minute, normal axis,
slightly long Q-Tc, peaked T waves in II, III, V2, V3 and V4,
upsloping ST elevation in V2.

Cardiac catheterization [**2127-11-18**], showed worsening native
disease, patent grafts with an occluded left anterior
descending distal to the touchdown of the saphenous vein
graft, 80% stenosis in the proximal obtuse marginal three,
two serial 90% stenoses in the obtuse marginal two proximal
to the saphenous vein graft touchdown.  Hemodynamics showed
wedge 35/30, cardiac output 3.8, cardiac index 2.0, SVR
18/32.

Chest x-ray from [**2127-11-13**], showed mild congestive heart
failure.

Sodium 140, potassium 4.8, chloride 107, bicarbonate 24,
blood urea nitrogen 36, creatinine 1.5 with baseline 1.1 to
1.3, glucose 64.  White blood cell count 6.3, hematocrit
30.9, platelet count 195,000.  INR 3.4, partial
thromboplastin time 45.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Congestive heart failure - The patient had a preserved
ejection fraction but it was felt his severe aortic stenosis
was leading to his dyspnea on exertion and his congestive
heart failure by evidence of his elevated wedge on
catheterization.  The patient had Swan-Ganz catheter in and
he was diuresed with intravenous Lasix with a goal of a
pulmonary artery diastolic of about 28 mmHg.  During his stay
in the CCU, the patient diuresed greater than five liters
negative with resolution of his lower extremity edema.
Although his pulmonary artery diastolic number never reached
20, it was felt based on the resolution of his edema and the
evidence of hemoconcentration on his laboratory values that
the patient had been adequately diuresed.  The patient was
therefore changed to p.o. Lasix and transferred to the
regular cardiac floor.

2.  Aortic stenosis - In terms of the patient's critical
aortic stenosis leading to his congestive heart failure, a CT
surgery consultation was obtained for the question of aortic
valve replacement.  The patient was unsure if he wanted to
proceed with this option understanding that it would be a
long road and that he was not the best surgical candidate.
After much discussion with the patient and his family, the
patient opted to defer the decision, to return home for the
holidays and to decide as an outpatient whether or not to
proceed with aortic valve replacement.  At the time of his
discharge, the patient was leaning towards not opting for the
surgery understanding that he would likely have continued
problems with shortness of breath, fluid overload.

3.  Ischemia - The patient had no chest pain while he was in
the hospital, however, he did have worsening coronary artery
disease by evidence of his catheterization and, if he had
opted for the aortic valve replacement, he would likely also
undergo a redo coronary artery bypass graft.  In the
meantime, the patient was continued on his cardiac regimen of
Captopril, Lopressor, statin and an Aspirin.

4.  Rhythm -  The patient with chronic atrial fibrillation.
His Coumadin was held initially for his cardiac
catheterization and he was therefore post catheterization
maintained on a Heparin drip until the decision regarding
cardiothoracic surgery was made.  Once the decision was made
that he would not be undergoing the surgery during this
hospitalization, Coumadin was restarted with a goal INR of
greater than 2.0.  Early in his hospital course, the patient
was well rate controlled, however, later in his course, he
started having heart rates above 100.  His beta blocker was
titrated up with good effect.  The patient did have one
thirteen beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
which was asymptomatic.

5.  Anemia - The patient received one unit of packed red
blood cells and started on iron replacement for iron
deficiency anemia.

6.  Gastrointestinal - The patient had some hemorrhoidal
bleeding while on the Heparin drip treated with local care.
He was continued on H2 blocker for peptic ulcer disease.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home with
services and instructed to weigh himself every morning and to
call his medical doctor if it is greater than three pounds
and to adhere to a two gram sodium diet.
