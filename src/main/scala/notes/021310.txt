Inferior vena cava filter placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110842**] is a 86 y/o woman with PMH sig for osteoporosis, recent
C. diff infection, s/p ORIF in [**3-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab who [**Street Address(1) 110843**]
House on [**5-14**] with difficulty breathing and O2 sat of 82% RA.
Afebrile per NH notes. She went to the ED where initial VS were:
99.1 110 132/80 22 99%4L, and was given Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin
for "pneumonia" on CXR. She had a LENI which showed extensive
right sided DVT, so she was started on heparin without a bolus
and admitted to the east medicine service.

On the floor, BNP was >40,000. CTA was done which showed
multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli and large effusions. She was
tachycardic on room air with stable blood pressure, but there
was concern for the possibility of decompensation so she was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring.

Per family members, reported worsening SOB over past couple
days, along with worseing LE swelling/declining MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] daughter
says she is not independently mobile, can occasionally feed
herself, and will talk with them. On admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she
was minimally verbal.

Pt was watched overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she remained stable
on room air alternating with 2L NC. She remained tachycardic and
cards was consulted for concern of TWI's on ECG as well as
positive biomarkers. She was called out to the floor but the
hospitalists on the [**Hospital Ward Name **] requested that she be
transferred to a cardiology service.

1)Hip fracture s/p ORIF [**3-12**]
2)C. diff colitis--tx recently stopped [**5-7**]

Relevant Imaging:
1)LE Doppler: 1. Acute deep venous thrombosis of the right
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. 2. No
evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.

2)Cxray: Moderate/severe CHF

ECG: Sinus Tach @ 115, NL axis/intervals, no LVH, no s1q3t3 new
Q waves in V1/V2, TWI in precordial leads V1-V3 with TWF all
leads (Q and T wave changes new since [**3-/2127**])

3)Echo ([**2127-5-15**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
septal akinesis, apical akinesis, lateral akinesis/hypokinesis.
Left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] LVEF
20-25%. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the report of
the prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2122-4-13**]
left ventricular systolic function is now severely impaired.
Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.
Mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now more
prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110842**] is  86 y/o female with PMH significant for recent ORIF,
recurrent C diff infections, now with CHF, PEs, leukocytosis,
and depressed mental status, transferred from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to [**Hospital1 1516**]:

1) Bilateral PE's: Likley from immobility after recent hip
surgery. Also explains EKG changes, elevated troponins, elevated
BNP, and initial hypoxia she presented with on admission. She
was started on heparin gtt with bridge to Coumadin. Cardiology
was consulted and felt that she would benefit from an IVC filter
given her burden of PE and ECHO findings. She underwent IVC
filter placement with no complications. She was restarted on
heparin gtt and Coumadin but given difficult blood draws heparin
was changed to Lovenox. Lovenox should be stopped once INR>2.0.
INR at discharge was 1.8.

2) CHF: No known history of CHF. Likely secondary to high
burdern of PE. Cardiac enzymes elevated in setting of PE.
Cardiology team was consulted and recommended medical management
of heart failure including beta-blocker, ace-inhibitor, and
diuresis with Lasix. She diuresed appropriately and tolerated
medications well. She will be discharged on fixed dose of Lasix
with close monitoring of her I/O's. If there is >3 lb weight
gain, she should receive an additional dose of Lasix. She is
also being discharged on supplemental potassium since she is
being diuresed. Her potassium levels should be monitored
closely.

3) Leukocytosis: Patient presented with leukocytosis ~30 on
admission. Unclear etiology. All culture data were negative. C.
diff negative x3; checked given recent history of infection. She
was empirically started on Flagyl, which she should take for
total of 2 weeks until B toxin result returns. Likely elevated
in context of PE and slowly coming down; ~15 at time of
discharge.

5) s/p hip replacement: Physical therapy worked closely with
patient. Scheduled for follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in few weeks.

6) dementia: Ms. [**Known lastname 110842**] appears to have dementia, corroborated
with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the last couple years. This was
addressed with the family in multiple family meetings with
social work, specifically regarding her health care proxy who is
primarilly her brother. Secondary HCP is her daughter.
