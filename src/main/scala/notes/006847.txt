Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum

Colonoscopy
Packed red blood cell transfusions


History of Present Illness:
62 yo M with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease and diverticulosis
transferred from an OSH with BRBPR concerning for a lower GI
bleed. Patient experienced some flu-like illness over [**Holiday **]
and reports taking Ibuprofen for her symptoms. This morning, she
was baby-sitting with another elderly female friend when she
reported having new onset crampy bilateral lower quadrant
abdominal pain this afternoon, followed by one large, cathartic
bloody BM at 2:30 PM today. She placed a diaper and after the
bloody BM walked to another room when she felt LH, saw 'all
white' and then had a witnessed syncopal event by her friend.
She was told she syncopized for a few seconds, without a head
strike. She was not post-ictal, had no tongue biting, seizure
activity, or loss of bladder, but was still having BRBPR at the
time. She was transported to [**Hospital3 **] by ambulance. At
the OSH, she was also reported to have an episode of near
syncope with SBPs to the 70s and HR to the 50s (likely thought
to be vagal) along with multiple episodes of continued BRBPR.
Labs at OSH significant for Hct of 33.4. She was transfused 2 U
PRBCs prior to transfer, but no other plasma products. Per the
patient, her VWD is very mild and only has required ddAVP prior
to surgery in the past. Pt c/o some sore throat after the
lavage, but denies fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath (but did aspirate some of the NG fluid during the
lavage), lower extremity swelling, or dysuria.
.
In the emergency department, VS were: 102 92/46 10 100% on RA.
Pt received Zofran 4 mg IV x1. Labs sig for WBC of 15.1 and Hct
of 32.5 (baseline of 33.4 at OSH). NG lavage negative. 2 PIVs
placed. Patient had one large bloody BM in the ED. GI and
surgery were consulted. In the MICU, pt was noted to have active
bleeding with 2 episodes of BRPBR, approximately 500 ccs each.
Her Hct dropped ~10 pts from 32.5 -> 23.9 within four hours of
admission requiring urgent transfusion of 4 PRBCs, initiation of
humate-P (human pooled VW factor and Factor VIII), and urgent CT
angiogram.

CTA: IMPRESSION:

1. No definite evidence of active extravasation seen. Dense
fluid within the colon suggests hemorrhagic products in the
distal colon.

2. Diverticulosis, with no evidence of diverticulitis.

EKG: Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature beats in a
quadrigeminal pattern. No previous tracing available for
comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Colonoscopy: Findings:
 Protruding Lesions Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula with medium openings
were seen in the ascending colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be
of moderate severity. There was a small amount of fresh blood
seen in the ascending colon and this was the only area of the
colon with bleeding. The cecum and the rest of the colon had no
blood in it. Multiple diverticula were seen in the sigmoid
colon. Diverticulosis appeared to be of moderate severity.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the ascending colon
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] disease who presents with
continued BRBPR.
.
#. GI bleed: Patient with brisk lower GIB in the setting of
known bleeding diathesis.  Nasogastric lavage was negative so
the patient was not started on a PPI. Patient received ddAVP as
well as Humate-P in setting of previous diagnosis of [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 4516**] Disease.  Patient received 10 units packed red
blood cell transfusions to keep her hematocrit stable.  She had
a CT angiogram that did not show active extravasation.  A
colonoscopy on [**12-7**] showed diverticula throughout with old blood
in the colon.  The bleed was thought to be secondary to a
diverticular bleed.  The patient had no more episodes of
bleeding and her hematocrit remained stable.
.
#. Bleeding diathesis: Pt with history of easy bruising and
bleeding from reported VWD, uses ddAVP around time of procedures
only and has never required resuscitation before. She was
started on DDAVP and Humate-P as above. Heme-onc was consulted
and felt that her factor VIII and vWF levels were not consistent
with vWF deficiency but family and personal history were
consistent with bleeding diathesis. Humate-P and DDAVP were
discontinued.  HemOnc suggested she should get outpatient workup
for functional platelet analysis with platelet aggegation
studies.
.

Transitional Issues
Would recommend outpatient platelet aggregation studies to
evaluate for a qualitative platelet abnormality, given that the
laboratory testing done does not support the diagnosis of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] disease.
