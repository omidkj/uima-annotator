Admission Date:  [**2197-7-16**]       Discharge Date:  [**2197-7-27**]


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old woman with
a history of coronary artery disease, noninsulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, and hypertension who was admitted to the
CCU with hypotension and new atrial fibrillation in the
setting of urosepsis.  The patient was intubated for airway
protection.  She was in her usual state of health which was
mildly confused and occasionally agitated but able to
converse and propel herself in a wheelchair until the day of
admission [**2197-7-16**] when she was noted by the nursing
staff in her nursing home to be somnolent and diaphoretic
with elevated fingerstick blood sugars.  She was also
relatively hypotensive with a blood pressure of 80/60.  Her
white blood cell count at [**Hospital1 2670**] was 16,000 with 2%
bandemia.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] for evaluation.  At the nursing home, she had
received 500 mg of Levaquin.

Upon presentation to the emergency room in the afternoon, her
vital signs revealed temperature 101.8, heart rate 109, blood
pressure 107/43.  Intravenous fluids were initiated at that
time.  Head CT was negative for bleed.  Blood pressure stayed
in the high 90s systolic until the evening of admission when
she developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
rate to 160-170.  Three cycles of cardioversion were
attempted with apparent atrial rhythm induced but not
sustained.  An Amiodarone drip with bolus, Dopamine, and
Levophed were started.  A right subclavian line and femoral
arterial line were placed.  The patient had a blood pressure
of 60-90/palpable for approximately 90 minutes.  A blood
pressure of 150/110 was achieved with Dopamine 20, Levophed
30, and after 8 liters of normal saline.  The Dopamine was
weaned to off in the emergency room.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU.  She did transiently assume what
appeared to be atrial rhythm.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5762**] and the CCU fellow
were contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding the plan.  The strategy was to
intubate the patient and to use pressors/inotropics and
cardioversion as needed but not to pursue catheterization.

irregularly irregular, normal S1 and S2, no S3, no S4, and no
murmurs.  Carotids revealed normal volume and upstrokes, no
bruits.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended
with hypoactive bowel sounds.  The extremities revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There were 2+ dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.  There was
positive hyperpigmentation of the right shin.

intervals 0.94 and 0.485, ST elevation of 1.5 mm in III and
0.5 mm in aVF, ST elevation of 1 mm in V1 and V2-V4, and
inversion in V5.  The next EKG also on [**2197-7-16**]
revealed normal sinus rhythm at 96, axis 68 degrees, and

the head was negative for intracranial hemorrhage.
Echocardiogram on [**2197-5-26**] revealed normal size left
atrium, normal size right atrium, left ventricular thickness
size normal, ejection fraction of 40%, right ventricular
chamber/motion normal, no aortic stenosis or aortic
insufficiency, no mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis, no
tricuspid regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and
severe hypokinesis of all apical segments.  In the apex,
there was no thrombus.  There was hypokinesis of the anterior
septum, akinesis of the apex, no thrombus, and hypokinesis of
the anterior septum and free wall.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 77-year-old woman with history of
coronary artery disease (positive troponins and abnormal
echocardiogram, no catheterization) who presented with
hypotension, increased CK and troponin, and new atrial
fibrillation in the setting of urosepsis.

HOSPITAL COURSE
Cardiovascular/myocardium:  The patient had an ejection
fraction of 40% by echocardiogram on [**2197-5-26**] with
residual hypokinesis.  Outpatient medication regimen
consisted of ACE inhibitor and beta blocker.  It was decided
to reassess the myocardial function after the episode of
atrial fibrillation and hypotension was passed and to restart
the ACE inhibitor and beta blocker when the patient was no
longer pressor or inotropic dependent.  The patient's
decreased blood pressure was thought to be secondary to
sepsis and atrial fibrillation with good response to the
Dopamine and Levophed.  The Levophed was weaned off by
hospital day #2 with systolic blood pressures in the 110s
over diastolics in the 60s.  She was maintained on Diltiazem
drip for three days for atrial fibrillation but this was
discontinued by hospital day #3.  She was started on
Captopril on hospital day #2 and titrated gently.  This was
held on hospital day #4 for systolic blood pressure in
