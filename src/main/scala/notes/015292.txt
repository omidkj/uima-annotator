Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
 Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 85 F with history of HTN, Afib, moderate aortic stenosis,
GI bleed, presents with four days of increasing shortness of
breath. She feels she may have overdone herself on a recent trip
to [**State 531**]. She sat next to a sick person at the Rockettes.
This Sunday, she had chills, cough and a running nose. She
improved somewhat with hydration. She denies cp, fever, h/a,
changes in vision, leg swelling. She called her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 9006**]
who recommended holding of on the Lasix, which she had been on
in the past.
She continued to worsen over the next day and was having
signficant breathing difficulty. Her family called EMS. She was
found by EMS to be in respiratory distress with at sat in the
70s and RR 30-40. She was started on BiPAP on scene. EMS started
on CPAP, NTG x [**3-11**], Lasix 40mg IV.

In the ED, intial vitals 99.6 111 133/73 39 97%/ BiPAP. A&Ox3.
Lungs with crackles to mid lung fields. No JVD or LE edema.
Blood cultures were sent. She was on a nitro gtt for about 10
minutes, which was stopped for pressures in the 100s. Her RR
improved, and her more comfortable. Prior to transfer, VS: 82
109/54 24 100 on [**11-13**] and 100% CPAP. Levo/CTX were started prior
to transfer. She had 1 PIV, getting a second.
.
Currently, her breathing is better.

REPORTS:

CXR AP [**2129-1-19**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with small right
pleural
effusion.

Transthoracic Cardiac Echo [**2129-1-20**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal
half of the inferolateral wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral
annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2127-7-2**], a
mild left ventricular wall motion abnormality is now apparent
and the severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly worse. The
severity of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation are
similar. Is the patient a candidate for intervention?

Renal U/S [**2129-1-24**]:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Bilateral renal cysts.

CXR PA/LAT [**2129-1-25**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Mild pulmonary edema is still present. Moderate
cardiomegaly.
Neither of the frontal nor the lateral radiographs show evidence
of pleural
effusion. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No
pneumothorax.



Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo woman with a h/o paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not on
coumadin, HTN, HLP, moderate AS (valve area 1.0-1.2, gradient
55), moderate MR, ischemic colitis with LGIB who presents with
acute dyspnea and respiratory failure in setting of URI.
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This was thought to be
secondary to acute on chronic heart failure secondary to
worsening valve disease and likely triggered by an respiratory
infection (question URI vs PNA?). She was initially admitted to
the ICU where she improved after positive pressure ventilation
and some diuresis. She arrived on the floor looking well and
feeling asymptomatic. After some further diuresis she continued
to improve. She finished a 5 day course of levofloxacin However,
she continued to desat upon ambulation and it was felt that she
was not at her baseline. Therefore she underwent several days of
diuresis until she was able to ambulate without desaturating and
was able to go home with physical therapy. She was also to
follow up with her outpatient cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
continued management of her congestive heart failure.
.
# Guiac positive stool with melena: We considered GI bleed in
the setting of a pt with h/o GI bleed and receiving sub C
heparin. However, given melena asymptomatic PUD was also
possible. We continued Pantoprazole 40mg PO BID and an active
type and screen was maintained. Fortunately, this self resolved
and HCTs remained stable. She was not interested in any
aggressive measures to intervene. She was to follow up with her
PCP regard
