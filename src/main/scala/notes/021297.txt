Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
AFib, flash pulmonary edema following DCCV


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Direct current cardioversion - [**2156-6-7**]


History of Present Illness:
65 yo F with history of rheumatic mitral valve disease with 4+
MR and [**2-18**]+ TR, recently diagnosed AFib on warfarin (2-3 weeks
ago), now s/p DCCV complicated concerns for flash pulmonary
edema.  She has been feeling fatigued and short of breath for
the last 2-3 weeks, was found to be in atrial fibrillation.  She
had been experiencing some orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, and
overall fatigue.  She underwent TEE/cardioversion today,
following which she was hypotensive with SBP in the 70's.  She
received IV fluids, following which she became acutely short of
breath.  Thought to be in flash pulmonary edema and received a
total of 60 mg of IV lasix, to which she put out 500 cc of urine
with symptoms improving.  Patient was started on a nitro drip
and transferred to the CCU for further medical management.
.
Currently patient is still feeling a little short of breath but
much improved.  Having a slight headache, but otherwise no other
complaints.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
TEE (Complete) Done [**2156-6-7**] at 5:28:18 PM
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 50 %). [Intrinsic function is likely depressed given the
severity of mitral regurgitation.] Right ventricle with
depressed free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened with characteristic
rheumatic deformity. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No spontaneous echo contrast or intraatrial thrombus
identified. Mild global [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Severe mitral regurgitation. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo F with history of rheumatic MV disease with 4+ MR and [**2-18**]+
TR, recently diagnosed AFib on warfarin (2-3 weeks ago), now s/p
cardioversion, complicated by flash pulmonary edema.
.
# PUMP/MR/TR/pulmonary edema: patient has history of rheumatic
heart disease.  TEE on this admission shows mild global
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral
regurgitation, mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and
mild aortic regurgitation.  Her last EF on TTE was 60%.  Her
post cardioversion course was complicated by flash pulmonary
edema for which she was admitted to the CCU where she was
diuresed with improvement of her symptoms.  She responded well
to IV lasix 40 mg doses.  She was discharged on metoprolol.
Initiation of an ACE inhibitor can be considered as an
outpatient, as her EF is likely overestimated on her TTE given
her severe MR.  Valve replacement/repair was discussed with the
patient on this admission.  She is a candidate for valve
replacement/repair given that she is symptomatic with new onset
Afib.  She will discuss this further with her outpatient
cardiologist.
.
# RHYTHM/A fib - patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation
2-3 weeks prior to this admission, her symptoms being fatigue
and dyspnea on exertion.  She is now s/p TEE and cardioversion,
reverted back to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient will continue
with warfarin and lovenox bridge (discharge INR of 1.9) until
she can have her INR rechecked at [**Hospital 191**] [**Hospital3 **] on
[**2156-6-10**].  Per EP recommendations, she was also started
amiodarone 200 mg TID for 3 weeks, then will decrease to 200 mg
daily.  Patient will need outpatient PFTs because of initiation
of amiodarone.
.
# CORONARIES - patient has no history of coronary disease
.
# Anxiety - patient was continued on home regimen of clonazepam
