discomfort which occurs at rest, about once per month. It lasts
for 1-2 hours and then subsides on its own. Over the last 2
months he has had 2 admissions at [**Hospital6 4620**] for
extreme fatigue and then with pneumonia.  He has been caring for
his wife who has jaw cancer with lymph node involvement. She is
due to start radiation therapy in [**Month (only) 547**].

been referred for TEE, outpatient cardiac catheterization and
surgical consultation for a mitral valve replacment.

Pertinent Results:
[**2146-5-24**] Ultrasound
1. No etiology for acute right upper quadrant pain localized.
Gallbladder
lumen containing sludge and rounded complex cystic structures
within it, which could either represent a polypoid lesion,
forming hematoma, or less likely a forming stone. Recommend MRI
for further evaluation.
2. Echogenic liver, most compatible with fatty infiltration.
Other forms of liver disease including more significant disease
such as significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be
excluded on this study.
3. Small right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2146-5-20**] where
the patient underwent Mitral Valve Repair with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  He was on
coumadin preoperatively for history of pulmonary embolism.  He
developed brief post-op a-fib and coumadin was resumed on [**5-24**].
ACE inhibitor was not restarted for heart failure as his BP
would not tolerate it.He will continue lasix until wound check
appt [**6-1**] and will evaluate further therapy at that time.

By the time of discharge on POD #5 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with
tylenol.  The patient was discharged to home with VNA in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions. First blood
draw Friday [**5-27**]. Target INR 2.0-3.0 for PE.
