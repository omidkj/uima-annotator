History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 50 year old man with history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), afib, DM2, obesity presenting after
being found down. He was found by his girlfriend "flailing" at
~1am on [**2174-8-18**].  EMS was called. EMS found him to be in afib
with RVR (120s) and with gurgling in his chest. A fingerstick
was normal. He was found to be hyperventilating.  He was
intubated for airway protection (ETT 7.5). Per report the
initial rhythm was afib with rate of 120.

Intraventricular conduction delay. Late R wave progression. ST-T

TTE [**2174-8-19**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS [**2174-8-24**]
1. No detectable paraspinal abscess; however in the absence of
OV contrast, this cannot be ruled out with certainity.
2. Persistent multifocal pneumonia with bilateral pleural
effusion.

B/L TIB/FIB AP/LAT [**2174-8-24**]
Nonaggressive periosteal new bone formation along the tibiae
bilaterally. Tiny lucency in distal right tibia of uncertain
etiology, but considered unlikely to represent a focus of
osteomyelitis. If clinically indicated, MRI or CT could help to
further assess this finding.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 50 year old man with history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 10%), afib, DM2, obesity presenting after
being found down on [**2174-8-18**]. EMS found him to be in afib with
RVR (120s) and in respiratory distress. He was intubated for
airway protection and brought to OSH.  RIJ placed and started on
dopamine gtt for hypotension and sedated with versed.  EKG
showed a.fibb with RVR, Peak troponin 0.56.

Initial workup at the OSH showed an elevated BNP of 310,
elevated WBC to 14. He did spike a temp to 101 and was started
on vancomycin and imipenem after blood and urine cultures
obtained.   He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU.

CCU course: Pt was weaned off dopamine and antibiotics were
changed to vanco and zosyn for suspected pneumonia.  ECHO done
showed stable cardiomyopathy (EF 10%) and CXR with infrahilar
opacification.  Sputum cultures grew proteums with GS + GPC
(pairs/clusters), GPR and GN diploccci.  Pt was persistently
febrile despite vanc/zosyn and thus ID called.

Pulmonary also consulted and underwent BAL.  BAL showed viral
inclusions on cytology.

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
Pts failure likely multifactorial.  From an infectious
standpoint, multi-lobar pneumonia is contributing, cultures
postitive on [**8-18**] as listed above, then on [**8-25**] positive HSV1 on
BAL. Sputum positive for MSSA. However, pt also has severe CHF
(EF 10%). Pt remained intubated and unable to wean from vent. Pt
felt to be severely volume overloaded and wt as droped over 30
kg since coming to CCU. He was aggressively diuresed, first with
bolus lasix, escalating to lasix gtt @ 20mg/hr and metalazone,
and diamox.  The process was complicated by hyponat
