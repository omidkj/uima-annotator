Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
fevers, cough

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old female with DM2 who presented to OSH ED
with flu like symptoms, fever, and SOB. Her symptoms began
Friday [**11-16**] with body aches and a cough. She also reports an
H1N1 outbreak in her area. She then developed fever to 102 and
chills last night, and today developed wheezing. Cough was dry,
non-productive, thinkns there might have been some blood in it
today. Symptoms associated with generalized fatigue and weakness
and lightheadedness especially on standing. She had nausea but
no vomiting, and did have diarrhea x 3 today. She presented to
an OSH ED, where she was noted to be hypoxic to 85% ra, and
hypotensive to 80s. CXR showed bilat infiltrates. CBC with
49%bands and wbc 5.2. Received 2l ivf, CTX, azithro, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the emergency department, triage VS were: t=unable, 117
90/50, 38, 95%. Pressure dropped to 70s. Was mentating fine,
satting well on NRB. A RIJ was placed and levophed was started.
Vancomycin, zosyn, and tamiflu were added to previously given
abx regimen. Lactate returned at 4.4. 1.5 liters of IVF were
given with lactate improved to 3.2. CXR revealed retrocardiac
consolidation which may represent pneumonia or atelectasis.
Intubation was considered but pt appeared well enough on NRB
that this was not performed. Most recent VS: 101/59 101 27 97%
NRB. Levophed at 0.04.

Of note, en route to the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) 8125**] Hospital called with report
that patient flu swab returned positive for H1N1- however,
reports were never confirmed and when [**Hospital 8125**] hospital sent
records, there was no documentation of flu swab.

Pertinent Results:
Lactic Acid:3.2 mmol/L
CXR [**2187-12-11**]:  FINDINGS: The right lateral chest is not included
on the study. In comparison with the previous chest radiograph,
the diffuse multifocal airspace opacities are unchanged with
mild superimposed pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax,
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with mild
cardiomegaly.

CHEST CTA [**2187-11-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse multifocal airspace consolidations in both lungs, not

significantly changed. Mediastinal lymph nodes are likely
reactive.
2. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
3. Right distal renal artery rim-calcified aneurysmal dilatation
measuring
1.2 cm.
4. Perirectal fat stranding with small amount of fluid within
the presacral space. Clinical correlation is recommended.
IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac consolidation which may represent
pneumonia or atelectasis.

LIVER ULTRASOUND [**2187-12-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffusely echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration.
Other forms
of liver disease and more advanced liver disease cannot be
excluded.
2. No abnormality at the gallbladder fossa.
3. No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. CBD measures up to 8
mm in a
post-cholecystectomy patient.

ECG: EKG:
sinus tachy at 116, NA/NI, no ST changes.

CT ABD [**2187-11-28**]
1. Diffuse multifocal airspace consolidations in both lungs, not

significantly changed. Mediastinal lymph nodes are likely
reactive.
2. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
3. Right distal renal artery rim-calcified aneurysmal dilatation
measuring
1.2 cm.
4. Perirectal fat stranding with small amount of fluid within
the presacral
space. Clinical correlation is recommended


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year old lady with diabetes who was admitted to
the ICU on [**2187-11-20**] with fevers and respiratory distress.

#. Sepsis/Pneumonia:  Due to concern for influenza and possible
superimposed bacterial pneumonia, she was started on tamiflu and
empiric antibiotics including
vancomycin/ceftriaxone/levofloxacin on admission.  She had
worsening respiratory distress and was intubated on [**11-21**], with
multifocal infiltrates on CXR.  Gram stain of sputum
demonstrated gram positive cocci and gram negative rods but
cultures were ultimately negative, including a negative
influenza DFA.  She developed ARDS and was managed with the
ARDSnet protocol, eventually having an esophogeal balloon
placed.  Antibiotics were broadened to include cefipime, which
was later changed to meropenem.  Her respiratory status
gradually improved and she was extubated on  [**2187-12-10**].  By the
time of transfer, she was satting comfortably on nasal cannula
and able to converse in a soft voice with some understanding of
our conversations. She is slightly confused, likely due to heavy
amount of sedative medications and prolonged intubation.

#. Acute Renal failure:  She developed acute renal in the
setting of sepsis and likely acute tubular necrosis.  Her renal
function normalized with continued treatment of her sepsis.

#. DM2:  She was treated with an insulin sliding scale.  She can
restart metformin as an outpatient.

#. Hyperlipidemia:  She can be restarted on lipitor. During her
hospitalization, she did develop transaminitis (which was the
reason lipitor was held), but this was thought to be secondary
due to an antibiotic sided effect, as liver enzymes trended
downward upon discontinuation of the offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

# Depression:  She can be restarted on prozac and amitryptiline.
