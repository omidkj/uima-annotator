Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs [**Known lastname 107933**] is an 87 year-old
female.  No prior medical history of coronary artery disease.
A prior echocardiogram showed an EF of 30 to 35% with
moderate LV systolic dysfunction with 3+ MR and 2+ AR.  She
presented with one day of chest pain localizing to the mid /
left side of chest.

The pain first occurred on the day before day of admission
and resolved with two sublingual nitroglycerin.  The patient
does not recall what she was doing at the time of onset but
denies any exertion in general.  The pain was associated with
diaphoresis and was not radiating and was not associated with
any nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath.  The pain
recurred at 5 AM on the day of admission and woke the patient
up from sleep.  At this time, the patient did not take any
medication, since the pain was relenting.  She called her
neighbor who is a nurse and had her family taking her to the
Emergency Department.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department the patient was
found to be in atrial fibrillation.  In the Emergency
Department and EKG was taken, which showed ST elevation in
the septal anterior leads.  She received nitroglycerin,
Lopressor 30 mg, aspirin, a GI cocktail.  She was started on
Heparin drip and Integrilin drip, finally with complete pain
resolution.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Status post LMCA.
4.  Right carotid artery stenosis.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Psoriasis.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 100 p.o. q.d.
2.  Isosorbide mononitrate 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Coumadin 1 mg Tuesday and Friday and 2 mg Monday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
4.  Norvasc 7.5 mg.
5.  Levoxyl 0.085 mg.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives by herself.  She denies any
alcohol or tobacco use or any IV drug use.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Cozaar.
3.  Digoxin.
4.  Benadryl.
5.  Hydrochlorothiazide.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General appearance:  She was lying in
no acute distress.  She appeared mildly anxious.  HEENT:  She
was anicteric.  Pupils:  Sluggishly reactive to light.
Tongue:  Has a [**Doctor Last Name 352**] plaque throughout its entire length.
Heart:  Irregularly irregular, S1, S2 with a systolic murmur
II / VI louder at the apex.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema and dorsalis
pedis are palpable bilaterally.

EKG:  In atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 127, normal
axis, and normal intervals.  ST depressions in leads II, III,
and aVF.  ST elevations in leads V1 through V4.  Q-waves in
leads V1 through V2.

CHEST X-RAY:  Clear costophrenic margin.  No consolidations.
Increased fuzziness at the right base and 2 x 2 cm round
opacity at the left upper lobe.

LABORATORY:  WBC 9.5; hematocrit 44.2, platelets 198.
Chem-7: Sodium 136; potassium 3.7; chloride 98; bicarb 27;
BUN 13, creatinine 0.9; glucose 177; LDL 114; CK 326;
troponin 20; MB 40; INR 3.4.

Cardiac catheterization:  Three vessel disease.  LMCA 30%
proximal stenosis.  LAD 99% after D-1.  Left circumflex 60%
stenosis after OM-1.  RCA 80% stenosis proximal.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 107933**] is an 87 year-old
woman with a prior history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
with no prior coronary artery disease presenting with angina,
EKG changes and troponin higher than 2.0 consistent with
septal anterior acute myocardial infarction.  At presentation
the patient was chest pain free.  She could not be taken to
cardiac catheterization immediately because of her elevated
INR.  She was initially treated with Vitamin K po and
subcutaneous to bring down her INR to a point where cardiac
catheterization could be safely performed.  Also she was not
started on 2B / 3A inhibitors or Heparin because of her
increased risk of bleeding in the context of an elevated INR.

On the second day of hospitalization, the INR had decreased
and the patient complained once again of chest pain which was
treated with sublingual nitroglycerin and then with
nitroglycerin drip with complete resolution.  Events of
unstable angina prompted the team to take the patient to
cardiac catheterization even though the INR had not yet
achieved the goal value of 1.6.

Cardiac catheterization:  Three vessel coronary artery
disease was found.  Both the LAD and the RCA were stented
with good results.  The patient was then started on aspirin
and Plavix.  During the rest of her hospital stay the patient
did not have anymore chest pain.

Rhythm:  On the day of admission the patient presented with
atrial fibrillation.  After cardiac catheterization the
patient underwent successful cardioversion and normal sinus
rhythm.  She was then started on amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
which was changed to amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.o.d. at the
time of discharge.

Congestive heart failure:   On the third day of hospital stay
the patient had one episode of pulmonary edema which
presented with shortness of breath.  A chest x-ray was taken
which showed increased vascular marking and encephalization
consistent with pulmonary edema.  The patient was treated
with morphine nitro drip and lasix to which she responded
with an urine output of 1200 cc in four hours with complete
resolution of the shortness of breath.  Her oxygen saturation
never dropped lower than 97% on six liters of oxygen.

Anticoagulation:  The patient is being anticoagulated on
Coumadin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  At the time of
presentation her INR was excessively elevated at 3.4.  The
patient was restarted on a low dose of Coumadin 2 mg on the
day before discharge.  On the day of discharge her INR level
was higher than 2.0.  The patient was discharged home on
Coumadin with a visiting nurse to measure her INR.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with visiting nurse and physical
therapist.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Lateral myocardial infarction /
pulmonary edema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.o.d.
3.  Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW UP PLAN:  The patient was set up with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts
monitor for the next two weeks.  She will follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] who will also review the results of the [**Doctor Last Name **] of
Hearts.  She will follow up with her primary care doctor
within the next week.
