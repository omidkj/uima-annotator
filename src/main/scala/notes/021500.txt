Admission Date:  [**2186-11-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2186-11-24**]


Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with coronary artery disease (status post ST-elevation
myocardial infarction), congestive heart failure (with an
ejection fraction of less than 20%), 4+ aortic regurgitation,
and a moderate large pericardial effusion who presented with
respiratory failure.

The patient was in her usual state of health until one day
prior to admission when she began experiencing chest pain and
shortness of breath.  The patient took 10 sublingual
nitroglycerin tablets for chest pain.  She went to [**Hospital6 4299**] where was intubated and started on
intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, and given Lasix and
levofloxacin.

A chest computed tomography was done to rule out dissection
and was negative.  The patient became hypotensive with
nitroglycerin, so she was switched to nitroglycerin paste.
her first set of cardiac enzymes was negative.  An
electrocardiogram revealed a left bundle-branch block (which
was old).  An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.33, a
PCO2 of 41, and a PO2 of 185 on an FIO2 of 1.  A computed
tomography scan showed bilateral pleural effusions with a
pericardial effusion and a thoracic aortic aneurysm.  The
chest x-ray showed left lower lobe and left lingular
collapse.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for a bronchoscopy.  On arrival, the patient's vital
signs were stable.  A bronchoscopy was performed which showed
moderate secretions in the posterior right lower lobe and a
left upper and left lower lobe obstruction by a mucous plug.
The mucous plug was aspirated, and a repeat chest film showed
re-inflation of the lung.  A bronchoalveolar lavage specimen
showed 2+ polymorphonuclear lymphocytes and no organisms.

The patient was initially hypertensive on admission.  She was
given fluids and Lopressor.  She then experienced transient
hypotension which led to an emergent echocardiogram which
showed 4-chamber enlargement, severely depressed left
ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 20%, a
large pleural effusion, and a moderate pericardial effusion
without echocardiogram evidence of tamponade.  There was also
severe aortic insufficiency, mild mitral regurgitation, and
mild tricuspid regurgitation, with a dilated aortic root.

The patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes with a peak troponin of 0.83, and a heparin drip was
started.

The patient then developed hematuria, and as the troponin
leak was thought to be due to demand ischemia the heparin was
dropped.  The patient's respiratory status improved, and the
patient was extubated and transferred to the floor.

The patient had been hypertensive and was treated with
hydralazine.  Initially, the patient's ACE inhibitor was held
for acute renal failure.

3.  Imdur 45 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Lasix 20 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on transfer to the floor revealed the patient's temperature
was 99 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate was 78 to 95, her
blood pressure was 132/40 to 180/50, her respiratory rate was
17 to 22, and her oxygen saturation was 97% to 100% on 2
liters.  In general, the patient was a pleasant female in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination was normal.  There was no lymphadenopathy and no
jugular venous distention.  Thoracic examination revealed
rales bilaterally two third of the way up the posterior lung
fields with decreased air movement and rhonchi.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate with a [**5-2**]
diastolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border, and
a 5/6 systolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal
border, and a [**3-2**] murmur heard at the apex.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Bowel sounds were
present.  Extremity examination revealed no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic examination revealed the
patient to be alert and oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Pertinent
laboratories on transfer to the floor revealed the patient's
blood urea nitrogen was 69 and her creatinine was 2.7 (which
was trending down from a value of 2.9 prior).

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient's respiratory failure was
likely due to a combination of pneumonia and congestive heart
failure.

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy with mucous plug removal
and re-inflation of the left lower lobe and left lingula.
The patient was also placed on a 14-day course of
levofloxacin.  On the day of discharge, the patient was day
13/14.

The patient continued to do well from a pulmonary standpoint,
and she was diuresed with Lasix and Natrecor, and her
respiratory status improved so that by the time of discharge,
she was oxygenating at 96% on room air.  In addition, the
patient's cough decreased during her hospitalization although
her lungs continued to have rales bilaterally and decreased
breath sounds at the bases.

The possibility of a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis
was discussed; however, the patient stated that she would
prefer no invasive measures.

 2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient ruled in
for a myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes with a
troponin peak of 0.85.  This was most likely due to demand
ischemia and not to atherosclerotic infarction.

The heparin drip was discontinued due to hematuria.  A beta
blocker was not added due to the patient's significant aortic
regurgitation.  Captopril was held for acute-on-chronic renal
failure.  Therefore, the patient was maintained on
hydralazine and Imdur for afterload reduction.  These
medications should be titrated up as much as possible as an
outpatient as the patient's blood pressure allows.  In
addition, the patient was maintained on aspirin.

 3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  During the patient's
hospitalization, she was at times fluid overloaded and at
times hypovolemic.  It was thought that part of her decreased
oxygenation was due to increased volume overload in her
lungs.  In addition, her jugular venous pressure when she was
transferred from the Unit was elevated at 12 cm.  Therefore,
the Heart Failure Service was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they recommended
starting a Natrecor drip with intravenous Lasix boluses.  The
patient diuresed very well to this with a net loss of
approximately 3 kilograms to 4 kilograms with improved
respiratory status.  Prior to discharge, it was thought that
the patient was euvolemic; although she did have some
persistent rales in her lung fields.  Therefore, the Natrecor
was discontinued.

The patient was to be discharged on 80 mg by mouth twice per
day of Lasix; however, this was held on the day prior to
discharge due to increasing renal failure.

 4.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with a
creatinine of 2.9.  The patient has a baseline creatinine of
1.6 to 2.1; implying acute-on-chronic renal failure.  A
fractional secretion of sodium on admission was greater than
1%.  Therefore, it was most likely that acute tubular
necrosis was the cause of the renal failure, and it was
likely due to a combination of hypotension on admission and
dye load from the computed tomography at the outside
hospital.

The patient's ACE inhibitor was held due to her acute renal
failure, and for several days her Lasix was held.  It was
then noted that the patient was hypervolemic, and the Lasix
was restarted with Natrecor (as mentioned above).  Since the
patient's ACE inhibitor was held for renal failure, she was
started on a c
