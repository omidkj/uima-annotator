HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83 year old
man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, tobacco abuse, coronary artery disease status
post MI, peripheral vascular disease status post right lower
extremity bypass, who was originally admitted for angioplasty
of his right lower extremity.

Ultrasound graft surveillance had demonstrated a stenosis of
his right bypass. During the procedure he was doing well
until the sheath was pulled. At that time he was noted to
have a blood pressure of 50/palp, he became acutely short of
breath and was placed on a 100% non-rebreather. A code blue
was called. IV fluids were given and Dopamine was initiated.
His blood pressure recovered and was 112/60 upon transfer to
the MICU. He was found to have a hematocrit of 27 and was
given 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient underwent angiogram on [**11-7**] and became
hypotensive with shortness of breath and transiently lost his
pulse when the sheath
was pulled. He was initially resuscitated with Dopamine and IVF
and
stabilized briefly in the CCU and went back to the vascular
service.

This episode could have been vasovagal. The hematocrit was
stable. The patient was ruled out by enzymes. The patient had
new EKG changes and had a new T wave inversion in V2 through
V6, and therefore underwent an echo, which showed worsening
EF of 25% to 30%, compared to 45% to 50% in [**2152-7-9**]. An
extensive LV systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel
coronary artery disease. He then went on the P-MIBI. There
was thought a possible reversal defect, so the patient
therefore underwent cath on [**11-10**].

Cath demonstrated severe 80% proximal RCA and stent
restenosis, moderate diffuse disease of the mid and distal
RCA. The LMCA had a 30% stenosis. The mid LAD stent was
patent with a 50% stenosis proximal to the stent. The D1 had
a 99% ostial stenosis and was a large vessel. The left
circumflex was diffusely diseased and it was a 100% occluded
after the OM1. PCI of the RCA in D1 was planned and heparin
and Integrilin were administered. The patient became
hypotensive shortly thereafter requiring IV pressors (Neo).
Right heart cath demonstrated extremely low filling
pressures. MRA is 3, RV of 25/1, PAP of 17/12 and wedge of 5.
Angiography of the left iliac and femoral artery demonstrated
retroperitoneal bleed from the earlier distal external iliac
puncture from 1 to 2 days ago. The site of the bleed was
tamponaded using a 7 x 40 mm Agile track balloon for 6
minutes with successful sealing of the bleeding site. Heparin
was reversed with protamine and Integrilin was discontinued.
The patient was unable to provide further history on transfer
to cardiology. At the time of the examination he denied chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, any pain or
other symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, coronary
artery disease (3 vessel disease), cath [**2152-7-14**] status
post stent to mid LAD (80%, 70%), distal, mid and proximal
RCA with fiber metal stents, hypertension, history of CVA in
[**2144**] with residual left-handed weakness, diabetes mellitus
type 2 with neuropathy, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
history of colon cancer status post colon resection, and BPH.

CHF, status post right leg grafting x2, status post right
jump graft from right femoral artery to popliteal artery, BPG
to DP with right arm vein, status post right vein ligation
[**2130**], status post colon resection for cancer in [**2135**], status
post right femoral artery to popliteal artery bypass graft in
[**2145**], status post right first toe amputation with debridement
of his right fifth metatarsal [**2151**], status post left CFA to
DP arterial bypass with vein, first toe amputation, left
fifth toe.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of transfer, afebrile,
blood pressure 126 to 150/50 to 75, pulse 86, respirations
20, 100 room air, lying in bed in no apparent distress,
smiling. Neck supple. PERRLA. MMM. MNO moist and clear. No
lymphadenopathy. CTAB anterior exam. Normal S1 and S2.
Normoactive bowel sounds, not tender, not distended.
Ecchymosis tracking on right down to buttocks. Extremities 1
times 4, no palpable DP or MM pulses bilaterally. Trace
bipedal edema. Right arm cath swollen, erythematous, but with
good distal pulse. CN II through XII grossly intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 134, potassium 4.2, chloride 100,
bicarb 25, BUN 22, creatinine 0.9, glucose 212 for a gap of
9. White blood count 7, hematocrit 35.2, platelets 171, CK
