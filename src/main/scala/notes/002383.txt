History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 4027**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with atrial fibrillation on
warfarin admitted for multifactorial hypoxia secondary to
pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and question of COPD exacerbation,
transfered to ICU in setting of acute intracranial bleed s/p
fall.  She was started initially on vancomycin and zosyn for
pneumonia, transitioned to community acquired coverage with
cefpodoxime and azithromycin.  She was also given lasix for
pulmonary edema which improved her respiratory symptoms.  There
was also some concern initially for a potentialy COPD
exacerbation, so she was given a dose of methylprednisolone
125mg then switched to prednisone.  She received one dose of
prednisone, and it was discontinued.

Patient fell out of chair around 3:30am morning of MICU
admission.  Head CT showed small right subdural bleed, and
mental status was alert and oriented x3. In late morning,
patient complained of headache and had new word finding
difficulties.  Neurosurgery was consulted and suggested repeat
Head CT 12 hours after previous one and reversal of INR.  She
was given 1 unit of FFP and 10mg IV vitamin K along with an
extra dose of 40mg IV lasix in the late morning.  Because she
sounded fluid overloaded on morning rounds, she had received an
extra dose of 40mg IV lasix in addition to home dose 2mg bumex
as well.  After FFP, patient developed respiratory distress,
presumed to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema.  She was
triggered on the floor for tachypnea.  She received an extra
dose of 40mg IV lasix in early afternoon, and a foley was
placed. Nitro paste was also placed. CXR showed pleural
effusions, right greater than left, and pulmonary edema.  MICU
consult was initiated, at which time, patient was verbally
responsive to her name but not oriented and not able to hold
conversation.  She was weaned from face mask to 2L nasal canula,
on which she was satting 93%.  She underwent stat head CT which
showed significantly expanded subdural hematoma bilaterally,
left worse than right.  She had an episode of nausea with
dry-heaving on return to the floor.  No mass effect was seen on
CT.  Neurosurgery evaluated patient at bedside, had coversation
with family that patient may recover if INR is reversed quickly.
 Patient was given another unit of FFP and transfered to the
MICU for further management in setting of mental status and
concern for potential respiratory instability.

Of note, patient was also noted to be having loose stools on the
floor.  Stool sample was sent for c diff prior to MICU transfer.


On arrival to the MICU, patient was somnolent and tachypneic,
unable to converse
