History of Present Illness:
48F with COPD and HTN, presenting to OSH with dyspnea and upper
abdominal pain.  He was recently admitted to OSH (2 weeks ago)
with 5 day stay for presumed COPD exacerbation, ?pneumonia at
that time.  This started after doing some yardwork outside -
thought perhaps had allergy to pollen.  Sent home on O2,
levofloxacin, and prednisone.  Improved quite a bit at home, but
again started feeling unwell yesterday.  Stayed in bed all day
and had poor PO intake.  Wife reports slightly loose bowel
movements.  Also c/o mild abdominal pain and seemed to have
worsening breathing difficulties.  Mild cough.  No fevers.  At 1
am today, asked his wife to call EMS.  Per wife, has depression
but does not believe he would be at risk for OD of any type.
.
He presented to OSH.  O2 sat in 80s initially, started on Bipap
and nebs.  Sats did not improve and looked fatigued, so was
intubated.  Pre-intubation developed hypotension and started on
levophed.  Of note pulse as low as 49 even with hypotension.
Initial K was 7.5, BNP was 8500.  He got lasix, D50, calcium,
and possibly kayexalate.  Also given hydrocortisone 100 mg IV,
vanco, zosyn, flagyl.  Medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**].  En route
hypotension worsened and he was started on dopamine.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T97.1 P67 BP114/48 R16 O2 sat 97% on
vent. Lab derangements include ARF, hyperkalemia, combined
met/resp acidosis (7.16), transaminitis with hyperbilirubinemia.
 CT abdomen without contrast performed and showed multifocal
pneumonia, equivocal peripancreatic stranding (lipase normal).
Head CT done prior to transfer - no bleed seen.  Patient was
continued on pressors - currently 0.06 levophed and 15 dopa.
Also got zosyn here.  CVL placed.  Current vent settings 550 x
?, FiO2 1, PEEP 12, and satting low to mid 90s.
.
On the floor, patient intubated and unresponsive.  Per ED,
unresponsiveness unexplained and has persisted, ?meds from OSH.

Lungs: Right slightly decreased compared to left, generally
coarse but no crackles or wheezes appreciated.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,

middle lobes, most likely reflecting multifocal pneumonia. Given
the
location, component of aspiration cannot be excluded. Follow-up
