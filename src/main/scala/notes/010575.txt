Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim DS / Atenolol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain, STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with 3 bare metal stents placed in the
SVG-to-LAD graft

History of Present Illness:
71 yo M w PMH of Stable Angina, CAD (CABG [**54**] SVG-LAD (2 stents),
and LIMA-OM, SVG-RCA(100% occlusion, non-revascularizable), LMA
100% prox occlusion)), PVD, One episode of Afib (post MI [**Month (only) **]
[**2184**], none since then, stopped warfarin after consultation with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
- Presented to Urgent care clinic with Dr.[**Name (NI) 93011**] [**9-15**] 9:30AM
due to chest pain, EKG there suggested, SVG-LAD occlusion =>
activated cath lab for direct-to-cath. Symptoms started on
Sunday night when he awoke with chest pain without any other
associated symptoms, pain was localized to the left chest
without radiation. Pain relieved with 1 SL Nitro. On Monday he
took SL Nitro q 4 hours which prevented pain that day, on
Tuesday he had to teach a finance class so he took Nitro patch
which also prevented pain that day. On Wednesday morning pain
returned and refractory to 4 SL Nitro, taken prior to visit with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16157**]. At baseline difficulty walking due to spinal
stenosis, but no SOB or DOE or PND. Plays golf regularly and on
average uses 1 SL Nitro every 3-4 days which alleviates his
Angina.
- In Cath Lab had 3 non-continuous stents to proximal, mid, and
distal SVG-LAD graft.

NC SaO2 100%. HD stable with HR 78, BP 135/75, comfortable, in
Sinus Rhythm

EKG [**2184-9-15**]:
Sinus with ST Elevation in aVR, depression in II, III, aVF,
V4-V6
.
CATH [**2184-9-15**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Venous conduit angiography demonstrated total SVG-LAD
occlusion
proximally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure with a central aortic pressure of 132/75 mmHg.
3. Successful stenting of the distal SVG-LAD with a 3.0x16mm
Promus
Element RX stent which was postdilated to 3.0mm.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid vessel SVG-LAD stent
thrombosis with a 4.0x28mm Promus Element RX stent which was
postdilated
distal and mi to 4.0mm and proximally to 4.5mm.
5. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal SVG-LAD stenosis
with a
3.5x20mm Promus Element RX stent which was postdilated to 4.0mm.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Total proximal occlusion of SVG-LAD graft.
2.  Normal systemic arterial pressure.
3.  Successful PCI of the distal SVG-LAD with a DES.
4.  Successful PCI of the mid SVG-LAD with a DES.
5.  Successful PCI of the proximal SVG-LAD with a DES

ECHO [**2184-9-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with globally preserved left ventricular systolic
function (EF>55%) in the presence of hypokineisis of the basal
and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and
distal septal segments. At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
There is mitral valve leaflet buckling, but frank mitral valve
leaflet prolapse is not appreciated. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-3-26**],
the septal wall motion abnormalities are new and the severity of
mitral regurgitation has increased (previously mild to
moderate).

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo male with long h/o CAD, mild stable angina, who presented
to clinic with severe chest pain not relieved by SL Nitro and
EKG consistent with STEMI with global ischemia.
.
# STEMI: The patient was taken to the catheterization lab where
he recieved 3 non-consecutive BMS to SVG-LAD.  His chest pain
resolved.  He was hemodynamically datble with no evidence of
arrythmia and no signs or symptoms of volume overload.
Integrilin was continued for 18 hours after the patient was
admitted to the CCU from the cath lab.  He was treated with ASA
325, Plavix, Crestor 40mg, and Metop succinate 25mg [**Hospital1 **].  He was
also started on a low dose ACEI prior to discharge.  Follow-up
echo on [**9-16**] showed normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with globally preserved LV systolic function (EF>55%)
in the presence of hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior and
inferolateral, as well as the mid and distal septal segments.
The option of a second CABG for repair of the SVG was discussed
with the patient, but he was not interested in this option.  He
was discharged on [**9-17**] in improved condition.  He will follow up
with his PCP for hospital [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
Cardiology.
.
# dCHF with Mild MR: The patient has a history of diastolic
heart failure, but was euvolemic during his hospital stay.  His
home HCTZ was stopped, but Metop succinate 25 [**Hospital1 **] was continued.
 Follow-up echo on [**9-16**] showed Normal left ventricular cavity
size and wall thickness with globally preserved left ventricular
systolic function in the presence of hypokineisis of the basal
and mid inferior and inferolateral, as well as the mid and
distal septal segments. At least moderate mitral regurgitation.
There is mitral valve leaflet buckling, but frank mitral valve
leaflet prolapse is not appreciated. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
 He was treated with medical management as noted above and will
follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient..
