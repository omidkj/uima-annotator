Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2534**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo R handed man with a PMH significant for
HTN, COPD and CAD s/p multiple coronary stents. He is maintained
at baseline on plavix and baby
ASA.

He was in his USOH until about 6:30pm on the evening of [**10-1**]. At
that time he was working in his garden, watering his flowers. He
then believes that he tripped and began to fall down an adjacent
[**Doctor Last Name **] or embankment and rolled down [**11-1**] feet. He does think
that he was dazed as a result of the injury but does not belive
he had LOC. His wife was able to see him, but could not go to
him as she is wheelchair bound. He last remembers watering
flowers and next remembers his daughter taking him to a nearby
hospital in [**Location (un) 3844**].

There, he was noted to have multiple areas of trauma, all on his
right side including a small R pulmonary contusion, a possible
liver lacertaion and an expanding bleed in his abdominal wall.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] where he has been hemodynamically
stable.

with
the exception of Right arm which is limited by pain.

Coordination: FNF without dysmetria.

Pertinent Results:
CT C-spine [**2120-10-2**]: 1. No fracture or acute alignment
abnormality.
2. Extensive degenerative changes, as outlined above, with most
marked right neural foraminal narrowing at C3-4 and C4-5.
However, these may predispose the patient to spinal cord injury
in the setting of trauma, and MR could be obtained as clinically
indicated. 3. Emphysema, limited imaging. 4. Status post
thyroidectomy; correlate clinically.

CT chest [**2120-10-2**]: 1. Peripheral opacity in the right upper lobe,
most likely scarring from prior infection though neoplasm is not
excluded. In addition, multiple pulmonary nodules as detailed
above for which outpatient followup with Chest CT in 3 months
unless stability from prior imaging can be shown. 2. Extensive
upper lobe predominant centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema.
3. Known right abdominal wall hematoma is more fully
characterized on concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

CT AP [**2120-10-2**]: 1. Large right lateral abdominal wall hematoma
with internal active extravasation of contrast. 2. Small
peripherally located right hepatic lobe low attenuation which
courses along the normal diaphragmatic muscular slip is normal
and not a
laceration. 3. 1.9 cm hemangioma within segment V of the liver.
4. Cholelithiasis. 5. Prostatic enlargement.

Trauma AP & pelvis xray [**2120-10-2**]: Right upper lobe lung lesion
(better defined on concurrent Torso CT), neoplasm until proved
otherwise. Suggest followup Chest CT in no

Xray R wrist 4 views [**2120-10-2**]: No fracture or dislocation.
Degenerative
changes are noted involving the first CMC joint. There are no
soft tissue
calcifications or radiopaque foreign bodies. There is soft
tissue swelling
involving the radial aspect of the wrist.

CT head [**2120-10-2**]: No interval change in small right subarachnoid
hemorrhage, without evidence of new hemorrhage, compressive
lesion or shift of normally midline structures.

R Shoulder and R hand xray [**2120-10-3**]: Views of the right shoulder
show no definite fracture or dislocation, though they are
technically sub-optimal. No fracture of hand or wrist.

F/u CXR [**2120-10-5**]: Comparison is made to prior study [**10-3**]
and 17. Cardiac size is normal. Bibasilar opacities have
minimally improved; still they could correspond to aspiration,
less likely atelectasis or contusions. There are no new lung
abnormalities, pneumothorax, or pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service after
sustaining a fall down a [**Doctor Last Name **], which resulted in R periorbital
ecchymosis, R pulm contusion, and R flank hematoma, noted to
have active extravasation. Because of the active extavasation
seen, he was admitted to the Trauma SICU for observation. He was
transferred to the floor as his respiratory status improved and
diet was advanced as tolerated. The rest of his hospital course
is summarized below by system.

Neurologic: Pt remained awake and alert, with normal mental
status. Repeat head Ct showed stable SAH and so no further
repeat CTs were deemed necessary. Neurosurgical consultation was
obtained who recommended Keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis for
one week. He received Dilaudid prn for pain and was transitioned
to PO meds when appropriate. Pt. will follow up in neurosurgery
clinic with a follow up non-contrast head CT in one month.

Cardiovascular: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was followed with serial hematocrits
and was bolused prn for tachycardia and mild hypotension. His
hematocrit slowly drifted down and finally reached it's nadir at
26.7. Since then, it has been progressively rising.

Serial hcts
41.5-31.6-30.2-31.7-29.1-27.4-26.8-26.7-27.3-30.3-28.9-30.4-31.4

He did develop some gross hematuria with clots. Urology was
curbsided and thought this was likely due to traumatic foley
placement on ASA and plavix and so the patient was monitored
with resolution of hematuria by the end of the hospital stay.

He did not require any blood transfusions. Of note, his aspirin
was restarted, however, as his stents are older than one year,
it was thought best not to restart his plavix.

Pulmonary: H/o COPD; albuterol nebs prn. Pt remained in the ICU
over the few days after his fall secondary to desaturation when
shovel mask removed. He ultimately improved with lasix diuresis
and was able to be transferred to the floor.

Gastrointestinal/Abdomen: His R abdominal wall hematoma was
noted to have expanded some since admission, but eventually
became stable.

Nutrition: Was advanced to regular diet when appropriate.

Renal: He developed some gross hematuria with clots. Urology was
curbsided and thought this was likely due to traumatic foley
placement on ASA and plavix and so the patient was monitored
with resolution of hematuria by the end of the hospital stay.
His foley was removed and he was able to void.

ID: no infectious problems during this hospitalization.

PT: Pt was seen by physical therapy who recommended discharge to
rehab for further physical therapy, but was optimistic about his
rehabilitative prognosis.

Medications on Admission:
ASA, plavix. lipitor, propanolol, imuran, amiodorone,
