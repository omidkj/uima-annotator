History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 y/o male with CKD stage IV, atrial fibrillation on
warfarin, T2DM, HtN, and asthma, admitted to the Trauma SICU
[**2177-2-10**] with flaccid paralysis in all extremities and
incontinence of bowel, after falling backward from a standing
position. He notes that during that day, he had some diminished
strength in his legs, which apparently accompanies gout flares.
He was otherwise feeling well. He was climbing the stairs with
crutches when he fell backwards. He struck his head but did not
lose consciousness. He had paralysis in his four limbs
immediately. He was attended to by family immediately and EMS
was called and brought to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was awake and alert in the
ED, and was able to recall all events. He denied chest pain or
shortness of breath at the time.
.
Initial imaging of the patient's cervical spine is concerning
for C3-4 fracture and resultant spinal cord injury. Labs in the
ED were notable for Hct 34.9. His INR was supratherapeutic to
7.6. His Cr was 3.5 at his baseline, other electrolytes were
normal. Serum and urine tox screens were negative. ECG showed
atrial fibrillation at a rate of 91 bpm, with lateral TWI in
V4-V6.
.
In the ED, he was given one unit of FFP and 10 mg of IV vitamin
K
to reverse his INR. Ortho spine was consulted and admitted him
to the TSICU. The night of admission, he was intubated for
airway protection. He has a known difficult airway, and a
fiberoptic intubation with 7f tube. Neurosurgery did not think
he was an operative candidate because of the extent of the
injury. Prior to the fall, he already had an 80% canal stenosis,
and his cord was likely permanently damaged. He has been
hemodynamically stable since admission to the TICU. He complains
of back pain when the propofol is stopped.

IMAGING:
[**2-10**] CT head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. No fracture.
3. Old right parietal lobe infarct.
4. Right frontal scalp lipoma.
.
[**2-10**] CT T spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or malalignment.
2. Degenerative changes as described above.
.
[**2-10**] CT C spine:
IMPRESSION: Large posterior bridging osteophytes extending
through most of
the cervical spine severely narrowing the central canal and
placing the
patient at increased risk for cord injury. Additionally,
osteophyte vs
osteophyte fracture fragment of posterior osteophyte of
indeterminate age also noted within the central canal at C3-4
level. Possible C6 osteophyte fracture of indeterminate age. MRI
is pending to further evaluate for cord injury.
.
[**2-10**] MRI C spine:
IMPRESSION:
Extensive posterior osteophytic formation, severely narrowing
the spinal canal dimension with cord flattening, most marked at
C3-4 level with myelomalacia changes in the cord at this level.
Findings are compatible with diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis. Multilevel canal narrowing at the remaining levels
is as described above.
.
[**2-11**] CXR:
An endotracheal tube lies with its tip between the clavicles,
approximately 7 cm proximal to the carina, this could be safely
advanced 2-3cm. An NG tube lies with its tip below the
diaphragm, the tip is not visualized on this study. There has
been interval development of a right mid lung airspace opacity,
the appearances are concerning for right lower lobe pneumonia.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
.
[**2-18**] CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-17**], there is little
overall
change. Cardiac silhouette remains at the upper limits of normal
or slightly enlarged with some fullness of pulmonary vessels
suggesting elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at
the right base is consistent with pleural effusion and
atelectasis. The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have
to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
.
[**3-3**] Head CT:
1. no acute intracranial process. MRI can be considered if there
is a high
suspicion for stroke.
2. Old infarct within the right parietal lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:

stroke, T2DM, Htn, asthma, presenting with spinal cord injury
after a fall, noted to have elevated INR and creatinine in
setting of warfarin therapy and Stage IV CKD.

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: secondary to spinal cord
injury.  Was intubated the night of admission electively.  Had a
trach and peg placed without problems.  [**Name (NI) **] did have some
intermittent plugging with secretions and at one time here
needed an emergent bronch for plugging.  He was dypsneic and his
vital volumes were slowing increased.  His dyspnea continued,
and was switched him to pressure control.  He was stable on vent
after with much PT and suctioning.  Also started abx for HAP
given CXR finding of PNA, rising wbc and fevers.  He was treated
with vanco/cefepime for 8 days.  Thoracic surgery and IP were
following along.  He should continue the inexsufflator while at
rehab.  He eventually was able to speak and eat with the cuff
down.  He is on a regular diet with thin liquids.  He is on
pressure control as stated in the discharge paper work.
.
# Spinal cord injury:
Secondary to traumatic fall with C3-4 fracture.  Has
quadraparesis now, with very low likelihood of any recovery per
surgery team.  He will now be vent dependent.  Is s/p trach/PEG.
 He has some spontaneous movements of his L side and mild
sensation in his L side as well.  Per ortho needs hard collar
for 8 weeks since his injury.  He should continue PT/OT.  For
pain control, we used dilaudid and oxycodone.  We started a
fentanyl patch after he was more stable on a regimen, and
eventually just transistioned him to oxycodone and fentanyl
patch.
