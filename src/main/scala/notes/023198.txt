Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI/ Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
81 yo female with history of DM, afib, CAD s/p CABG with LIMA to
LAD, SVG to RCA and OM who presented to [**Hospital3 6592**] with
chest pain that started at around 2pm while she was watching TV.
Pt reports a pressure like pain across her anterior chest with
radiation down both arms and pain in back.  She notes associated
diaphoresis and malaise but denies associated palpitations or
nausea.  She took nitroglycerin as well as 81 mg ASA at home
with no relief and then called 911.  At [**Hospital1 **] ekg was concerning
for inferior STEMI. She was started on a Heparin gtt, given
300mg Plavix and 325mg ASA and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  Cardiac catheterization showed 3 vessel CAD with
patent SVG to OM and LIMA to LAD as well as occlusion of SVG to
RCA.  Pt underwent placement of DES to the in the mid RCA.  She
was loaded with plavix 300 mg x 2 and transferred to the CCU. On
arrival to the CCU patient denied any further chest pain or
shortness of breath.
.
The patient notes increasing chest pressure over the past month
that has been responsive to NGT.  She has significant shortness
of breath at baseline and states that she cannot walk from one
room to another in her home without becoming short of breath.
She also notes 3 pillow orthopnea as well as peripheral edema at
baseline but denies PND.
.
She reports a 1 month history of cough productive of clear
sputum but denies associated fevers or chills, hemoptysis, blood
in stools, urinary frequency or urgency, history of stroke, or
GI bleed.  All of the other review of systems were negative.

Pertinent Studies
- ECG ([**8-31**]):
Most prominent are ST elevations in II, III, and AVF. Question
biatrial enlargment post prominent in RA, NSR, normal intervals.

.
- ECHO ([**2166-9-1**]): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). The estimated cardiac index
is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild-moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild-moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

- CARDIAC CATH ([**2166-8-31**]):
Findings:
  LMCA: Open
  LAD: 60% prox / 60-70% mid prior to LIMA
  LCX: 90% Prox / OM occlusion
  RCA: 90% mid / Diffuse distal
  SVG: 1) OM Patent 2) RCA occluded
  LIMA: LAD patent
Intervention:
  Intervention with DES to mid Native RCA with 0% residual.
Assessment:
  3 vessel CAD with patent SVG to OM and LIMA to LAD
  Occlusion of SVG to RCA as culprit for STEMI
  Successful DES to native RCA
  ASA 81mg daily and Plavix 75mg daily

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
81 yo female with history of CAD s/p CABG, DM, HTN p/w STEMI
with thrombosis of SVG to RCA now s/p placement of DES to the
RCA.
.
Active Issues:
# STEMI: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 6592**]
where she had presented with chest pain with EKG concerning for
interior STEMI. She was started on a heparin drip, plavix loaded
and underwent cardiac catheterization which showed 3-vessel
disease and thrombosis of her SVG to the RCA. Her LIMA graph and
SVG to OM were patent. She underwent placement of one DES to her
native RCA with restoration of flow.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well with impovement in ST elevations on her EKG.
Troponin and CK were noted to peak at 1.24 and 350 (CK-MB 46)
and then trend downward.  She initally had [**1-20**] residual chest
pain after the cath which resolved the following morning. She
remained chest pain free for the remainder of the admission.
She should continue taking plavix 75mg PO daily for at least one
year and aspirin 325mg daily indefinitely. She was also started
on atorvastatin 80mg daily.
.
# Acute on Chronic diastolic CHF: Pt reports history of CHF
requiring home lasix. She was clinically volume overloaded on
exam, with eleva
