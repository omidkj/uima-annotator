Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2109-9-9**] Aortic Valve Replacement(23mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine
Valve), and Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, vein graft
to obtuse marginal).


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2405**] is an 80 year old female with history of
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation(PAF) who presented with fatigue
and shortness of breath for approximately one week.  She has PAF
diagnosed 7 years ago and follows Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She manages her PAF
with Sotolol and Coumadin and has been largely asymptomatic
since her diagnosis.  She does not have palpitations or SOB and
she does not know when she is in sinus or afib.  About a week
ago, she noticed easy fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.  She
works 4 days a week as a salesperson and normal walks up and
down the stairs multiple times without difficulty.  Over the
past week, she gets SOB with exertion and on Saturday, she felt
dramatically weak while doing up the stairs and had to pause in
the middle.  She denies chest pain.  Seeing that her symtoms did
not resolve, she presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

[**2109-8-26**] Cardiac Echocardiogram: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35% %). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area =0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
[**2109-8-29**] Carotid Ultrasound: Less than 40% stenosis of the
bilateral internal carotid arteries.
[**2109-9-2**] Chest CT Scan: 1. Dense calcifications in the aortic
valve, mitral annulus and coronary arteries. Ascending aorta
measuring up to 41 mm. Moderate cardiomegaly. 2. Mild pulmonary
edema. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated adjacent
relaxation atelectasis. 3. Dense atherosclerotic calcification
of the abdominal aorta, proximal bilateral renal arteries and
celiac trunk. 4. Bilateral non-obstructing kidney stones. 5.
Hypodense lesions in the liver, too small to be characterized,
likely cysts. 6. Mildly enlarged pulmonary arteries, consistent
but no diagnostic of pulmonary hypertension.
[**2109-9-2**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system revealed 2 vessel disease. THe LMCA had a
discrete 30% lesion at the origin. The LAD had a discrete 70%
distal lesion. The LCX had a 60% lesion. The RCA was occluded
and filled by collaterals. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed
elevated right and left sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20
mmHg and LVEDP of 35 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension with a PASP of 50 mmHg. The cardiac index
was slightly decreased at 2.3 L/min/m2. 3. There was severe
aortic stenosis with a peak to peak gradient of 50 mmHg and a
calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.45 cm2. 4. Left ventriculography revealed 1+
mitral regurgitation. The LVEF was calculated to be 34%. 5. The
ascending aorta was extensively calcified.
[**2109-9-3**] Myocardial Viability Stud: The LV cavity is not dilated.
There is a moderate to severe defect in the MIBI portion of the
study in the mid to basilar inferior wall; it is unclear if this
is a true perfusion defect or an attenuation artifact. No
correlative defect is seen on the FDG portion of the study. The
FDG was overall not optimally taken up by the myocardium,
however, given this limitation, the walls appear symmetric and
all demonstrate glucose metabolism. IMPRESSION: Moderate to
severe defect in the inferior wall on the MIBI portion of the
study, but normal metabolism in this region on FDG. The defect
may be attenuation related, but this may also represent a region
of hibernating myocardium.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman s/p AVR/cabg and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
INDICATION: Rule out pneumothorax after chest tube removal.

COMPARISON: [**2109-9-9**].

PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 P.M:
There has been interval removal of all tubes except the right IJ
introducer catheter. There is no pneumothorax. Hazy opacity in
the left lower lobe indicates pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis. Equivocal underlying consolidation.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax after interval removal of tubes and
catheters. New left pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 2405**] was admitted to the medicine service with
congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation. She ruled out
for myocardial infarction. The EP and cardiac surgical services
were consulted and further evaluation was performed.
Cardioversion was initially performed on [**8-26**], and again
on [**8-29**] for recurrent atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone was
initiated at that time. Additional cardiac surgical workup
included echocardiogram, cardiac catheteterization, chest CT
scan, carotid ultrasound and viability study - please see result
section for details. Given her aortic valve disease, she was
cleared by the dental service after clinical and radiographic
examinations found no evidence of infection. She otherwise
remained stable on intravenous Heparin and was eventually
cleared for surgery. On [**9-9**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed an
aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting.
For surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative
note. In summary the patient had AVR(#23 [**Company 1543**] Mosaic
Porcine)CABGx2(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM),bypass time was 93 minwith
crossclamp 67 min. She tolerated the surgery well and was
transferred to the ICU in stable condition. Ms [**Known lastname 2405**] was kept
sedated on the day of surgery, on POD1 her sedation was
discontinued she was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.
She was noted to have afib and
