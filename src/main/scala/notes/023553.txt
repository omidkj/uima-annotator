Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, Hypoxia, Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F who goes to [**Location (un) **] for care, coming from rehab.
Presenting with several days of SOB, URI symptoms. At [**Location (un) **]
had SBP in mid-80's, CXR done -> ?PNA, got vanco/levaquin.
D-dimer sent. Positive. Could not get CTA, so got lovenox
empirically. Transferred here for lack of ICU beds.
.
On arrival to the ED, T 96.5, HR 74, BP 103/47, RR 20 96% 4L NC
demented at baseline (AOx1), coarse b/l breath sounds, ECG ->
unchanged, trop of 0.59, BNP 8445, Cards felt it was primarily
infectious picture and troponin represented demand ischemia.
CXR: ?retrocardiac opacity. SBP dropped to 80's in ED. 1.5L
fluid given. Started on dopamine peripherally. Extensive
discussion with the family undertaken by phone and confirmed
that patient is DNR/DNI. Do not want a CVL, okay with
antibiotics and dopamine.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient was comfortable and denied pain,
difficulty breathing or other complaints. VS: T98.1, HR 76, BP
105/43 (on dopa at 5ucg), RR 23, O2 sat 87% RA, and 93% 4L NC.
Was continued on pressors and antibiotics with improvement in
oxygenation and hemodynamics. Family discussion with daughter
[**Name (NI) 4134**] determined that patient is DNR/DNI with no pressors, no
unit transfers, no escalation of care.
.
Patient unable to confirm history secondary to baseline
dementia. Denies chest, abdominal or leg pain. Denied shortness
of breath or cough.

atelectasis or pneumonia. 2. Coarsened interstitial markings
which likely relate to chronic interstitial lung disease.

MICRO
Urine Cx ([**3-16**]): No growth
Blood cx ([**3-16**]): No growth to date
Sputum cx ([**3-17**]): GP rods, budding yeast
Urine legionella ([**3-17**]): negative
C Diff ([**3-18**]): Negative


Brief Hospital Course:
# Pneumonia/Hypoxia: Patient presented with acute hypoxia with
associated shortness and breath and hypotension concerning for
sepsis with pneumonia as source. On admission she had coarse
breath sounds bilaterally, leukocytosis and retrocardiac opacity
on CXR. She is a nursing home resident therefore initially
treated as HCAP with vancomycin/cefepime. She is also demented
at baseline and elderly, therefore coverage was subsequently
broadened to Vanc/Zosyn. Urine negative for legionella and
sputum culture with GP rods. Was empirically started on lovenox
for PE at [**Location (un) **] since she can't get CTA because of likely ARF,
however given that there is no clinical evidence for DVT,
D-Dimer positive but [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] score is 1.5 this was not continued
on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]. Was initially admitted to MICU for
hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation, but stabilized within
24 hours and was transferred to general medical floor. Her lasix
and anti-hypertensives were held and not restarted prior to
discharge. On general medical floor she had a speech and swallow
evaluation that was negative for any signs of aspiration. She
was discharged back to nursing home where she should continue on
Vancomycin/Zosyn until [**2155-3-25**] to complete a 10 day course.
.
# Hypotension: Blood pressures in 70-80's on admission likely
septic physiology with primary pulmonary process as underlying
etiology. Also had leukocytosis with abdominal distention and is
a nursing home resident so she was also ruled out for C Diff.
Elevated troponin to 0.59, but this was thought [**2-17**] to demand,
unlikely to be cardiogenic shock. Required pressors briefly
while in MICU. BP's remained in 110-120's after fluid
resuscitation. Her anti-hypertensives were held on admission and
not restarted prior to discharge.
.
# UTI: Urinalysis on admission with pyuria, bacturia, leukocyte
esterase positive however urine culture was negative therefore
she was not treated for urinary trct infection.
.
# ?CHF/CAD: Unclear history from family regarding prior cardiac
history. No documentation of EF, but did not appear volume
overlaoded on admission. On toprol, imdur, lasix and
spironolactone as outpatient but these were held during
hospitalization. Elevated troponin T to 0.59 on admission, but
this was thought [**2-17**] to demand.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure?: Unknown baseline renal
function, but admission creatinine of 2.0 likely from pre-renal
failure given hypotension and other evidence of dehydration.
Improved to 1.4 with IVF. Vancomycin and Zosyn were
appropriately renally dosed.
.
# Anemia: Patient has macrocytic anemia with hct in upper 20's
and MCV of 102. No prior records to determine whether this
represent patient's baseline, but no signs of active bleeding
while inpatient.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on synthroid
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued on paxil
