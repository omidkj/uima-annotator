Service:  FENARD-ICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Hematemesis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58 year old
male with a history of Hodgkin's Disease status post XRT to
the chest with resultant esophageal stricture, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, transient ischemic attacks
with occluded right internal carotid artery, who presents to
the [**Hospital1 69**] with frank
hematemesis.

The patient had a routine esophageal dilation performed
earlier on the day of admission.  Apparently three hours
after the procedure, the patient began vomiting frank bright
red blood.  The patient estimates about six to eight ounces
in several episodes.  Positive lightheadedness and dizziness.
No chest pain, no bright red blood per rectum, no melena, no
prior history of GI bleeding.

The patient came to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department, was tachycardic, but had stable blood
pressures.  He had a few episodes with decrease to the high
80s which responded to fluid boluses.  NG lavage was deferred
secondary to concerns for esophageal perforation.  The
patient was sent for a chest CT scan with no extravasation of
contrast or air from the esophagus was seen per Emergency
Department Radiologist.

The patient currently without any new complaints.  He states
only complaint currently is of thirst.  The patient has not
eaten or drank since noon on [**2141-3-20**].  No chest pain, no
abdominal pain.

[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.5 F.; blood pressure
117/62; heart rate 102; respiratory rate 14; saturation of
95% on room air.  In general, the patient is awake, alert, in
no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equally round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Anicteric.  Oropharynx dry.  Neck was supple, no
bruits.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No
subcutaneous emphysema.  Cardiovascular:  Normal S1 and S2.
II/VI systolic ejection murmur in left upper sternal border
to apex.  Abdomen with positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive abdominal bruit.  No
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities with no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII grossly intact.  Moves all four
extremities.

LABORATORY:  CBC is white blood cell count 16.1, hematocrit
34.9, platelets 370; 84% neutrophils, 6% lymphs, 7%
monocytes, 6.5 eosinophils.  INR 1.2, PTT 30.7.  Chem-7
within normal limits.

EKG sinus tachycardia at 118, normal axis and intervals.  No
ischemic ST-T segment changes.

Chest x-ray with bibasilar atelectasis, no free air.  CT scan
of chest by report, no free air or extravasation of contrast
from esophagus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 58 year old male with a
history of Hodgkin's Disease status post chest XRT and
resultant esophageal strictures, status post esophageal
dilatation, who now presents with hematemesis.

1.  Hematemesis:  Because of the time course, it was felt
that the patient's hematemesis was probably related to the
patient's esophageal dilation done earlier in the day.
However, it could not be ruled out that the patient had
coincidental hematemesis on aspirin and Plavix.

The patient was treated conservatively with serial hematocrit
checks.

2.  Esophageal stricture status post dilatation, no obvious
clinical signs of perforation.  The patient was kept NPO and
was monitored closely in the Intensive Care Unit.  The
patient did not have any further evidence to suggest any more
imaging necessary to assess whether this patient had any
further perforation.

3.  Low grade temperatures:  The patient had evidence of
Candidiasis on esophagogastroduodenoscopy earlier during the
day.  It was thought that this might be the cause of the
patient's low grade temperatures.  The patient was started on
intravenous Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl and blood cultures were
drawn.  The patient's Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl was eventually
discontinued and the patient was continued on Diflucan 100 mg
p.o. q. day to complete a ten to 14 day course.

4.  Tachycardia:  Most likely secondary to hypovolemia.  The
patient was aggressively volume resuscitated and closely
monitored.  The patient's anti-hypertensive medications were
held due to his borderline low blood pressure.

5.  Access:  The patient had two large bore intravenous lines
placed.

6.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was started on intravenous
Protonix and pneuma-boots.

7.  Hematologic:  Repeat hematocrit showed a drop from 34.9
to 25.9, however, the patient declined blood transfusions at
this time.  It was felt that the patient's hematocrit drop
was partly hemodilutional due to the large amount of fluid
that the patient received.  Hematocrit remained stable
without any transfusions.  Repeat hematocrits were 26, 27,
28.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophageal Candidiasis.
2.  Esophageal stricture status post dilatation.
3.  Hematemesis secondary to esophageal dilatation.
4.  Hemodynamic instability and anemia secondary to
hematemesis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Flovent.
2.  Lipitor.
3.  Albuterol.
4.  Serevent.
5.  Accupril.
6.  Levoxyl.
7.  Theophylline.

The patient's Plavix and aspirin were held.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**],
the patient's gastroenterologist will decide on when to
restart these medications.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient was discharged directly
from the Fenard Intensive Care Unit to home and will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 349**] as an outpatient.
