Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14961**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 89 year old female from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with a
past medical history significant for CAD s/p CABG x3, left basal
ganglia CVA with residual right-sided hemiparalysis, chronic
constipation, HTN and GERD who presented to the ED from HR on
[**2155-6-19**] with the chief complaint of abdominal pain and nausea,
vomiting. A physician at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab evaluated the patient for
abdominal pain and nausea and vomiting x 1 that began at 3 pm
the day of presentation. She did not have any fevers/chills at
rehab. Her baseline is intermittent diarrhea and constipation
with a history of chronic constipation. Thus, she did not note
any change in her bowel movements or blood in her stool or
emesis. She had no cough, chest pain or shortness of breath. No
clear sick contacts.
.
In the ED, the patient was afebrile at 96.5 with a HR of 87, BP
170 systolic. She had an NGT placed for recurrent emesis in the
ED and both her NGL and rectal was guaiac positive (rectal only
occult). Her K was found to be 6.5 and she was given 1 amp D50,
bicarb, 1 amp calcium gluconate, and 10 units of regular
insulin. In addition, she received 3 amps of bicarb in 1 liter
D5W as well as Anzemet for nausea, hydralazine 10 mg IV and
Lopressor 5 mg IV for hypertension. She also received phenergan
for nausea.
.
A CT of her A/P showed:
.
1. 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 1.5 cm mural
thrombus, with
high density within the thrombus concerning for content rupture.

.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal arteries
and iliac
arteries, as described above.
.
3. Cholelithiasis.
.
No prior CT for comparison.
.
Her EKG showed NSR2 smm concave ST elevations V1-V3 with peaked
T waves. LAD. Biphasic T waves in I and AVL. The T waves
appeared more prominent than her baseline in 12-00.
.
In the ED, the patient had witnessed recurrent episodes of
emesis and therefore, had an NGT placed. She had a reported
episode of hypoxia after her emesis and was felt to have
aspirated. Repeat CXR was unremarkable. She was given empiric
Levo/Flagyl in ED for aspiration pneumonia.
.
ROS:
.
Decreased PO intake over past 24 hours secondary to recurrent
emesis. Also notable for weight loss -unknown amount per son. [**Name (NI) **]
chest pain, shortness of breath.

without difficulty at baseline. No tobacco/EtoH at present. No
history of significant use of either.

Physical Exam:
Tc and Tm=99.5 P=72 BP=114=130/44 RR=20 99% on 4 liters O2
Gen - Arousable, somnolent, responds to voice, mumbles
HEENT - dry MM, NGT in place with brown liquid
Heart - RRR, Grade II/VI rumbling holosystolic murmur at LUSB
Lungs - CTAB
Abdomen - Soft, NT, ND, no bruits, palpable pulsatile mass to
left of umbilicus. No rebound/guarding
Ext - No C/C/E
Rectal - Guaic positive (occult), NG guaiac positive


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2155-6-19**]: Mildly prominent pulmonary vasculature, no
effusions.
.
CXR [**2155-6-21**]: The lungs are clear without infiltrate or effusion.

.
CT A/P [**2155-6-19**]:
1. 5 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 1.5 cm mural
thrombus, with high density within the thrombus concerning for
content rupture.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal arteries
and iliac arteries, as described above.
3. Cholelithiasis.
.
Abd U/S [**2155-6-20**]
1.  No evidence of free fluid in the abdomen or retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2.  4.8-cm AAA.
3.  No evidence of cholecystitis.
.
CT A/P [**2155-6-22**]:
1.  5-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with somewhat
increased contrast filled lumen measuring 3 cm, with hypodense
mural thrombus measuring 1.1 cm, representing contained rupture
as described previously.
2.  Diffuse wall thickening of the large bowel from ascending,
transverse, and descending colon, with ascites in the bilateral
paracolic gutter, worrisome for colitis, which may be infectious
versus inflammatory type, or, can be ischemic colitis.  Clinical
correlation is recommended.
3.  Extensive atherosclerotic disease with calcification of
abdominal vessels.
4.  Small left kidney.
5.  Small pleural effusion with atelectasis.
.
video swallow:
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW EXAMINATION: A video oropharyngeal
swallowing fluoroscopy was performed today in collaboration with
the speech and language pathology division. Various
consistencies of barium including thin liquid, nectar thickened
liquid, puree, and a cookie coated with barium were administered
to the patient.

The oral phase was notable for impaired bolus formation and
control with premature spillover into the valleculae and
piriform sinuses. There was prolonged oral transit time and
mild-to-moderate oral cavity residue. The pharyngeal phase was
notable for delayed swallow initiation, reduced laryngeal
elevation, and absent epiglottic deflection. There was
aspiration into the airway before the swallow due to swallow
delay and premature spillover as well as after the swallow due
to residue. Both spontaneous and cued coughs were ineffective at
clearing the aspirate. Bilateral vocal fold adduction was
observed.

IMPRESSION: Oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration.

For greater detail and for treatment recommendations, please see
the dedicated speech and language pathology division report of
the same date.
