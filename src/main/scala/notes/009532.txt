Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Aortic Valve Replacement (#21mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] tissue)/ Coronary

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old Spanish speaking male with a history of
Burkitt-like Lymphoma/Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and coronary
artery diseas s/p multiple PCI/stents. He initially presented
with an acute MI and rescue PTCA/stenting of his LAD back in
[**11/2090**] and stenting of his OM1 in [**2093-3-11**]. On [**2094-2-26**] he
was re-cathed d/t progressive dyspnea and
complaints of chest pain. Angiography revealed a 30% stenosis
proximal to the LAD stents and partially in the first stent, LCx
with no significant disease, OM1 stent widely patent, small OM2
with a 80% stenosis, RCA with a 90% lesion in the proximal
portion, mid RCA 80%. EF at that time was noted at 39%.
Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal and mid RCA
completed at this time.He underwent a cardiac cath on [**2105-9-3**]
which revealed a patent left main stent and LAD stents, 70%
diagonal lesion, LCX ostial
90% stenosis in jailed segment, RCA with proximal in-sent
restenosis 70-80%. Echo on this day showed moderate aortic
stenosis. He was then referred for surgery.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity. All four pulmonary veins identified and enter
the left atrium.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Lipomatous hypertrophy
of the interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity
size. Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately
depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened
aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+)
AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular calcification. No MS. Physiologic MR (within
normal limits). LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
apical,mid-distal anterior, and mid-distal septal akinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: There is normal right ventricular systolic
function. The left ventricle continues to display apical and mid
to distal anterior and septal akinesis but basilar and mid
segments of all the other wall segments show improved function.
The left ventricular EF is about 40%. There is a well seated
prosthetic valve in the aortic position with no evidence of
perivalvular or valvular regurgitation. The peak gradient was 30
mm Hg, with a mean of 14 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 3.8. The
effective valve area is about 1.2 cm2. The rest of valvular
function is unchanged from the prebypass study. The thoracic
aorta is intact aft
