PORTABLE CHEST, [**2196-9-3**]

COMPARISON: [**2196-9-2**].

INDICATION: Lung [**Hospital3 **] distress.

Endotracheal tube, tracheobronchial stent and vascular catheter
are unchanged in position. Large right lung mass measuring
approximately 10 cm is unchanged, as well as an area of
predominantly discoid atelectasis at the right lung base. Upper
lobe predominant emphysema is present. Left lung is grossly
clear

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was transferred from [**Hospital6 12112**] intubated for
evaluation.  She was apparently having increased SOB and cough
for 2 weeks prior to presentation.  On evaluation at [**Last Name (un) 4199**] she
was in respiratory distress and was intubated.

At [**Hospital1 18**] she was taken for bronch and showed:
The left mainstem, left upper lobe and left lower lobe
segmental bronchi appeared normal. The right mainstem
bronchus showed evidence of extrinsic compression, especially
in the distal aspect. The bronchus intermedius appeared to be
compressed from an extrinsic mass to the level of the right
middle lobe. The right lower lobe bronchi are completely
obscured with tumor. The bronchoscope could be advanced into
the right upper lobe with patent segmental bronchi, however,
the takeoffs to the right upper lobe appeared to be
compressed extrinsically.

Using the balloon dilation, the right mainstem was dilated to
13 mm in diameter. Following this, tracheal bronchial (Y)
stent was prepared with the following dimensions. The
diameter of the tracheal limb 16 mm, diameter of the right
and left mainstem bronchial limbs 13 mm, length of the
tracheal limb 4 cm, length of the left mainstem limb 2 cm,
length of the right mainstem limb 1.5 cm. The stent was
deployed in the trachea in the usual manner and was
manipulated into place. Following this, an Ultraflex
uncovered metallic stent (10 mm x 2 cm) was advanced into the
bronchus intermedius and deployed. Using a balloon, the stent
was dilated to 10 mm in diameter. The bronchoscope was then
advanced into the stent and appeared to be patent distally.
The right middle lobe orifice could be easily visualized. The
right upper lobe orifice remained unobstructed by the
metallic or the silicon stents.

She was extubated and brought out of the OR and brought back to
the ICU.  She had some respiratory distress and required
re-intubation.  On [**9-3**] she was extubated and did well.

She has been stable and plans have been made for the patient to
be transferred back to [**Last Name (un) 4199**].
