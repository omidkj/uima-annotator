HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year old
female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia, and glottic/subglottic stenosis with an
esophageal by computer tomography who was admitted for a
workup of this mass.

The patient first developed neck pain and persistent phlegm
and a hoarse voice approximately six months ago.  The patient
was initially treated conservatively with antibiotics and
saline mist with some improvement in the hoarseness of her
voice, but no complete resolution of symptoms.  Evaluation by
bronchoscopy showed a laryngeal mass.  The mass was biopsied
but reportedly was benign.

A follow-up neck computer tomography showed a high-grade
narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway with extensive
edema and soft tissue thickening as well as an esophageal
mass impinging on the trachea.  She has recently noticed
worsening neck pain with the left greater than right and
odynophagia.  However, the patient denies any fevers, chills,
chest pain, or shortness of breath.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
temperature was 98, heart rate was 86, blood pressure was
136/64, respiratory rate was 20, and 96 percent on room air.
In general,  in no acute distress.  Awake and alert.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed
normocephalic and atraumatic, anicteric.  Pupils equal, round
and reactive to light.  OC/OP clear.  The chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Extremities revealed 1 plus
pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities.

RADIOLOGY:  A computer tomography from [**2157-6-1**] showed
high-grade narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway
with extensive edema and soft tissue thickening.  There was a
soft tissue density at the level of the glottis which
appeared to cause obstruction of laryngeal cartilage and
extended laterally to the cartilage.  There was a proximal
esophageal mass displacing the trachea anteriorly.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to
undergo an ENT evaluation and possible biopsy.  This took
place on [**2157-6-21**].  The patient was taken to the
operating room and underwent a laryngoscopy, esophagoscopy,
and three biopsies.

The patient was noted to have a normal esophageal mucosa.  No
lesions or masses were seen.  There was a sluggish right
vocal cord, a normal right vocal cord, and a normal left
vocal cord.  There was no glottic or subglottic mass seen.
The [**Doctor Last Name 19634**] formed sinuses were clear.  This was an
essentially a normal examination.  Please see the dictated
Operative Note for further details.

Postoperatively, the patient was found to have right-sided
back pain - pleuritic in nature - and difficulty breathing.
The patient denied any chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, or
vomiting.  The patient received albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers without improvement.  A bedside laryngoscopy
showed laryngeal edema; unchanged from appearance in the
Operating Room.  A chest x-ray showed dulled costophrenic
angles consistent with effusions, but no pneumomediastinum.

Because the patient had undergone a rigid esophagoscopy,
there was some concern that the patient may have received an
esophageal perforation; however, the chest x-ray did not show
this.  The other concern was that the patient was having
possible bronchospasm.  The patient was therefore given
Decadron 10 mg intravenously and kept nothing by mouth.  The
patient was also continued on her nebulizer treatments.

A chest computer tomography was obtained later that day which
showed an interval development of a right-sided pneumothorax
and pneumomediastinum with ill-definition of the inferior
esophagus and new bilateral pleural effusions.  Therefore,
the patient was returned to the Operating Room with the
Thoracic Surgery Service and underwent a right thoracotomy
with repair of an esophageal perforation along with an open
gastrostomy and open jejunostomy.  The perforation was
approximately 1 cm long in the right anterolateral mid
esophagus.  A right neck mass was also removed and sent for
pathology.  The pathology on that mass later came back
showing a benign cyst outlined by respiratory epithelium with
acute and chronic inflammation with fibrosis; most consistent
with a bronchogenic cyst.  Please see the dictated Operative
Note for further details of the operations.

The patient was started on imipenem postoperatively, and the
endotracheal tube was switched from a double to a single
lumen tube.  On postoperative day one, the patient spiked a
temperature to 101.9 degrees and was pan-cultured.  All
cultures taken in the Operating Room came back negative;
however, the Operating Room cultures taken during the repair
of the esophagus later showed methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus along with sparse growth of
Enterococcus and Streptococcus viridans.  As a consequence,
the patient was switched from imipenem to vancomycin; to
which imipenem was then added back.  The patient was
ultimately discharged on vancomycin and meropenem for a total
6-week course.

On postoperative day three, the patient continued to be
stable and was extubated without incident.  On postoperative
day five, the patient's tube feeds were started via the
jejunostomy tube.  Over the course of the next several days
tube feeds were advanced without incident.  The patient's
chest tubes were changed from bulb suction to water seal on
postoperative day seven.  Also on postoperative day seven,
the patient was noted to have some right arm swelling.  The
patient underwent a right upper extremity ultrasound which
showed no deep venous thrombosis.  The swelling in the leg
resolved by the time of the patient's discharge.

On postoperative day eight, the patient underwent an upper
gastrointestinal swallowing evaluation which showed no
evidence for a leak.  On postoperative day nine, as the
patient continued to do well, the patient's chest tube was
removed.  An Infectious Disease consultation was obtained; in
which the total 6-week course of vancomycin and
imipenem/meropenem was recommended.  The patient was also
started on a clears diet, which she tolerated well.

Over the next several days, the patient was kept in house due
to continual spiking of fevers.  As noted above, all blood
cultures were negative.  However, the patient did have chest
x-rays showing right middle lobe and right lower lobe
parenchymal opacities consistent with either atelectasis or
pneumonia.  Therefore, the patient received aggressive chest
physical therapy; especially on the right.  On postoperative
day eleven, the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of
22.5, for which she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells
- bringing her hematocrit up to 30.5.

On postoperative day thirteen, the patient underwent a chest
computer tomography wi
