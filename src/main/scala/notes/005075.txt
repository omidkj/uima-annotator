Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
apical and anterior and lateral wall hypokinesis. The remaining
left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Preserved [**Hospital1 **]--ventricular systolic function.

2, No change in valve structure and function

3. Intact aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2113-8-10**] where
the patient underwent Coronary Artery Bypass x 3 with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].   Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time
of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
The patient was discharged home with VNA in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
