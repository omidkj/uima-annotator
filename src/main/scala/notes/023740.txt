Chief Complaint:
RLE swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
peripheral catheterization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 year old man with a history of dilated
cardiomyopathy, anterior [**First Name3 (LF) **] in [**9-17**], and atrial fibrillation
who presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from clinic on [**2177-11-18**] for
evaluation of bilateral lower extremity edema and possbile right
leg gangrene. He had noticed increasing lower extremity edema
over the previous few months.

Past Medical History:
Cardiac cath [**9-17**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant
circulation with single-vessel and branch coronary artery
disease. LMCA and LCx had no angiographically-apparent
flow-limiting stenoses. LAD was totally occluded after a small
first diagonal branch, with TIMI 1 flow beyond the occlusion.
RCA was a large dominant vessel, with a 90% stenosis in the PDA
branch.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severe pulmonary
hypertension, with markedly elevated filling pressures and low
cardiac output. RA mean was 19 mmHg, PAP was 87/38 mmHg with a
mean PA pressure of 59 mmHg. PCWP was 41 mmHg. Cardiac output
and index were low at 2.7 L/min and 1.35 L/min/m2, respectively.
Initial PA oxygen saturation was 44%.
4. Stenting of the LAD was performed with overlapping 3.0 x 18
mm
and 2.5x28 mm Cyper stents dilated to 3.5 and 3.0 mm.

Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) [**9-17**]:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(ejection fraction 20 percent) secondary to severe global
hypokinesis with some relative preservation of the basal and
midventricular segments of the inferior and posterior walls.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. There is focal hypokinesis of the apical free
wall of the right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but not stenotic. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

ankle.

Echo [**2177-11-26**]
Conclusions:  EF 20%
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe regional
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities
include septal akinesis, apical akinesis, lateral
hypokinesis/akinesis, and
inferior hypokinesis/akinesis; the basal inferior segment
contracts best. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2177-9-15**],
tricuspid
regurgiation peak gradient is now higher. Ventricular systolic
function
appears similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) [**Year (4 digits) **]: He was admiited to the surgical service and worked
up for peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] catheterization due to ischemic lower
extremities, with necrotic toes on the right foot. He was
started on vancomycin, flagyl, and vancomycin for empiric
therapy for gangrene. He underwent lower extremity angiography
which revealed proximal superficial femoral artery stenosis, and
distal superficial femoral artery stenosis. However, due to
subsequent fluid overload and renal failure from the contrast
dye, no further procedures were performed. He will follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.

2) Pump - Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed acute decomensated heart failure
with renal failure from the contrast used for the angiogram.  He
had increasing respiratory distress and changes in mental status
consistent with decreased cardiac output from worsening CHF.  He
failed to respond to lasix and was intubated for respiratory
distress the morning of [**11-24**]. After this, he became hypotensive
with SBP to the 80's. He received fluid and the CHF service was
consulted, who felt that the hypotension was secondary to the
propofol and CHF. A swan Ganz catheter and central line were
placed, which showed CO 3.0, CI 1.5, and wedge around 25.
Dobutamine was continued and dopamine was added for pressor
support. He was transferred to the CCU team for tailored CHF
therapy.  He was originally maintained on dopamine, dobutamine,
and vasopressin. The dopamine and dobutamine were weaned and
niseritide was begun together with [**Hospital1 **] lasix. The vasopressin
was weaned and a lasix drip was started. After the patient's
foley was readjusted, he began to make about 1-2 liters of urine
output per day. Digoxin was added to his regimen to boost
output. He was continued on lasix and niseritide until just
prior to discharge when niseritied was discontinued and pt was
converted to 60 mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **].

2) CAD - The patient had an anterior [**Hospital1 **] with cardiac
catheterization and Cypher stenting in [**9-17**]. His troponins were
elevated to 0.25 during hospitalization which were likely due to
renal failure.

3) rhythm - The patient was in A. fib during hospitalization. He
has a VVIR Pacer in place which was interrogated by EP twice
during the hospital course. Anticoagulation with heparin was
done with switching to
