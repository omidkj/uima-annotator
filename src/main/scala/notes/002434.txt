Intubation

History of Present Illness:
81 yo M with COPD, HTN, end stage dementia with alzheimers
(averbal baseline) who presented from [**Hospital3 **] with
respiratory distress and intubated in ambulance on way here. He
has had a recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 336**] for ?L. wrist fx and

contractures. He was noted after starting baclofen to retain
food in his mouth more and then he began to have temps 101-103

[**Hospital1 18**].

Pertinent Results:
INDICATION: 81 year old with respiratory failure, post
intubation.

PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL RADIOGRAPH. No prior studies.

FINDINGS:
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. The lungs
appear grossly
clear. There is no evidence of CHF. No pneumothorax is
identified. An
endotracheal tube is seen with its tip in the mid trachea at the
level of the
clavicles.

No focal pneumonic consolidation or evidence of CHF. No
pneumothorax. ET
tube with its tip in the mid trachea.
THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

INDICATION: 81 year old with respiratory distress with
anisocoria.

TECHNIQUE: CT brain without IV contrast. No prior studies for
comparison.

FINDINGS:
Extensive hypodensity is seen in the periventricular and
subcortical white
matter consistent with chronic small vessels infarctions. There
is no acute
intracranial hemorrhage. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
appears preserved.
The ventricles and sulci are prominent, though the ventricles
including
lateral, third, fourth, and temporal horns appear somewhat more
prominent than
the degree of sulcal prominence. No prior studies are available
for
comparison. Incidental note is made of a cavum septum
pellucidum. Dense
arterial calcifications are seen in the vertebral and internal
carotid
arteries. Calcifications are also seen in both right and left
basal ganglia.
The osseous structures and soft tissues are unremarkable. A
fluid level is
seen within the sphenoid sinus. The patient has been intubated.
The
remaining paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:
Extensive hypodensity consistent with small vessel ischemic
changes and
chronic infarction. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Marked
prominence of
the ventricles may be related to age related atrophy, but no
comparison is
available. An element of communicating hydrocephalus is not
excluded.

CLINICAL HISTORY: An 81-year-old male with aspiration pneumonia
status post
central line placement.

TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest.

COMPARISON: Examination performed 12 hours prior.

FINDINGS:

Endotracheal tube remains in stable, satisfactory position.
There has been
interval placement of a right subclavian central venous
catheter, which
terminates within the distal SVC. There is no definite
associated
pneumothorax. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable and
within normal
limits. Lung fields appear grossly clear. Osseous structures are

unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

Satisfactory positioning of subclavian central venous catheter
without
evidence of pneumothorax.
-
-
INDICATION: An 81-year-old male with aspiration pneumonia,
status post right
subclavian line placement. Verify placement of nasogastric tube.


COMPARISON: Made with a prior AP supine portable chest x-ray,
dated [**2157-12-22**]
at 1711.

FINDINGS:

AP supine portable chest x-ray: A nasogastric tube is seen
extending below
the diaphragm in the fundus of the stomach. An endotracheal tube
seen in
place approximately 4 cm superior to the carina. A right
subclavian central
venous catheter terminates in unchanged position in the middle
superior vena
cava. There is no evidence of pneumothorax on the supine chest
x-ray. Cardiac
and mediastinal contours are stable and within normal limits.
Lung fields
appear grossly clear bilaterally. The osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

Placement of the nasogastric tube tip in the fundus of the
stomach.
Endotracheal tube, and right subclavian central venous catheter
in unchanged
position.
-
-
CLINICAL INDICATION: Respiratory failure.

Endotracheal tube, central venous catheter and nasogastric tube
remain in
place. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. The right
lung is clear
except for minimal discoid atelectasis at the left lung base.
Within the left
lung, there is minimal hazy opacity in the left infrahilar
region. This
appears not significantly changed.

IMPRESSION:

Stable radiographic appearance of the chest.

INDICATION: An 81-year-old with this respiratory failure,
increased white
blood cell.

TECHNIQUE: Portable AP chest radiograph.

Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated
[**2157-12-24**].

FINDINGS:

The right IJ line is terminating at the junction of SVC and
right atrium. No
pneumothorax. Left costophrenic angle is not included in the
present study.
Thoracic aorta is tortuous. Note is made of opacity in the right
lower lobe,
probably representing pneumonia. However, please evaluate by
repeated PA and
lateral chest x-ray with better view. No CHF is noted.

IMPRESSION:

Patchy opacity in the right lower lobe, probably representing
pneumonia. Left
costophrenic angle is not included. Please further evaluate
repeated PA and
lateral chest x-ray with better quality.

INDICATION: An 81-year-old man with respiratory failure, status
post
extubation, now with increased white blood cell and neutrophil
count.

Comparison is made with a prior AP portable chest x-ray dated
[**2157-12-28**], at 8:20.

AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: A right subclavian central
venous catheter
is seen with the tip terminating in the distal superior vena
cava. The
cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar silhouettes remain stable. A
tortuous aorta
is seen with mural calcifications. The appearance of bilateral
pulmonary
vessels appears normal. The left
