Brief Hospital Course:
55yo female with extensive medical history s/p total abdominal
colectomy with end ileostomy and mucous fistula underwent
takedown of her ileostomy and ileocolonic anastamosis without
complication.  Post-operatively, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital Ward Name **] PACU secondary to persistent somnolence. She was
found to be tachycardic and tachypneic with bilateral rale and
rhonchi throughout. O2 sat was 90% on 100% face mask.  CXR
revealed mild pulmonary edema with poorly aerated lung fields.
Patient was intubated for respiratory failure. Patient was
tranferred to the ICU for ventilatory support.

On POD 1, patient was extubated and placed on face mask.
Pulmonary medicine consult was obtained.  Patient began
treatment with Levo 500mg for likely aspiration pneumonia.  Ms.
[**Known lastname 104972**] respiratory status failed to improve and on POD 2,
patient was re-intubated for repiratory distress and a right
subclavian line was placed.  CTA was obtained, which was
negative for pulmonary embolism, however revealed left lower
lobe collapse.  Antibiotics were switched to Vanco/Zosyn.
Patient underwent bronchoscopy for BAL, with no evidence of
infection and minimal secretions.  She received albuterol nebs
q4 hours. On POD 3, repeat CXR showed left lower lobe
retrocardiac opacity and new left mid lobe opacity worrisome for
aspiration.

On POD 4, tube feeds were initiated via oral gastric tube. [**Name8 (MD) **]
RN, patient had small amount of liquid stool. Patient placed on
CPAP with pressure support.  On POD 6, patient was extubated
with difficulty to high flow face mask.  Steriod burst given
secondary to patient's history of COPD.  On POD 7, diet was
advanced slowly to a regular diet and tube feeds discontinued.
On POD 8, patient's O2 requirement was weaned to room air. On
POD 9 she was discharged home from the ICU (because there were
no beds on the floor).  She went home on 2 more days of
prednisone, as well as pain medication.
