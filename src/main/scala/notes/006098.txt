History of Present Illness:
**Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge**
Ms. [**Known lastname 99956**] is a 60 year-old female with a history of metastatic
breast cancer who presents with shortess of breath and findings
suspiscious for PE on an outpatient CTA. Patient has been
experiencing occasional SOB for the last two weeks. She was
treated with levofloxacin for ?PNA during the last week per
patient. No significant change in breathing in the last two
days. No chest pain, PND, orthopnea, lower extremity swelling or
palpitations. Has a stable nonproductive cough for the last few
weeks. Patient went for a previously scheduled out patient CT
today and was asked to come to the hospital due to bilat DVT and
suspected LLL PE and left basal effusion.
.
In the ED, temp 99.2, HR 120, BP 115/72, RR 18 and 77% on room
air. O2 sats improved to 87% on 4 liters then 100% on NRB. HR
decreased to 100. She was given protonix then heparin IV (4,400
unit bolus).
.
In the MICU, started on a Heparin drip for thought of PE. Lenis
this am were negative. Attending radiologist reviewed film today
and ruled out PE and confirmed effusion. Heparin gtt was
stopped. ECHO with bubble study ordered and pending. Bactrim
started for UTI. Pt did well and is being called out tonight
with minimal SOB.

midpeaking systolic murmur at RUSB.

Pertinent Results:
**Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge**
.
Echocardiogram [**2118-9-7**]
- A patent foramen ovale is present.
- Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global
  systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%)
- Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
  regurgitation is seen.
- The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined.
- There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Bilateral lower ext u/s [**2118-9-6**]
No evidence of lower extremity DVT.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Low volate. Flattened T-waves
throughout.
.
CT ABD/CHEST:
1. Overall interval progression of disease with increased
abdominopelvic ascites as described above.
2. Filling defects in the femoral and iliac veins bilaterally
suggestive of DVT.
3. Stable hepatic hypodensities, too small to characterize.
4. Increased confluence of the skeletal metastases involving the
axial and appendicular skeleton suggestive of disease
progression.
5. Stable enlarged left ovarian lesion.
.
CTA CHEST:
1. Filling defect in the branches of the left lower lobe
pulmonary artery are highly suggestive of pulmonary emboli.
2. Interval increase in the left basal effusion with passive
atelectasis of the left lower lobe.
3. Large amount of peritoneal ascites.
4. Diffuse skeletal metastasis involving the axial and the
appendicular skeleton, this appears more confluent suggestive of
increased tumor burden
.
CT HEAD:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. No edema.
Detection of smaller mass lesions is limited due to lack of IV
contrast.


Brief Hospital Course:
**Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge**
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 60 year-old female with a history of metastatic
breast cancer, admitted as outpt. chest imaging was worrisome
for PE
.
# SOB: Pt was admitted to MICU, however appropriate oxygen
saturation on room air. Repeat [**Location (un) 1131**] of PE without definite
PE, and lower extremity ultrasound negative for DVT. Transferred
to OMED, underwent bubble study which was positive; pt was
notified of this finding. Small L pleural effusion was not
tapped, as did not appear significant enough to be causing pt's
symptoms. Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge.
.
# Breast cancer: Metastatic to peritoneum & bone. No active
therapy while in house. Pt to follow up with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 19**] as

.
# Anemia: Macrocytic anemia with baseline in the mid-30s. No
acute isssues. Pt eloped from hospital prior to discharge.
