History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52**] is a 63 year-old female with Burkitt's lymphoma
(last chemo [**2134-4-29**]) with recent parainfluenza pneumonia who
presented on transfer with sepsis.

Over past three weeks has had cough.  Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**6-29**] and felt to be consistent with postviral irritative
bronchitis; at that time had had no fever.  She was given a
brief course of steroids followed by inhaled steroids.

Then presented to an OSH with continued cough and fever to 103.
Found to have a RLL and RML PNA on CXR and was given 2 L NS and
azithromycin/ceftriaxone and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as she
receives all of her oncologic care here.  Enroute in the
ambulance, she developed hypotension.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals included P 106  BP 78/45.  She
was fluid resusicated with 5 L NS, however remained hypotensive
with SBPs in the 80's-90's.  She was treated with vancomycin and
cefepime and admitted to the ICU.  A CTA was done which showed
no PE, but did show opacification in the RML concerning for
infection.

[**7-13**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. Right perihilar opacification is new since [**2134-6-17**] and
may represent early infectious process versus nodule. Correlate
clinically. Recommend follow up imaging post treatment or
dedicated CT chest for further evaluation.
2. Right-sided pleural effusion is resolved compared to the
prior chest x-ray.
3. Minimal right basilar atelectasis is noted.

[**7-13**] CTPA:IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Focal nodular opacity in the right middle lobe measuring up
to 2.4 cm in cross-section with surrounding ground-glass halo,
new from prior study from three weeks ago, likely represents
pneumonia.
3. Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] micronodularity in the lower lobes most likely
related to
aspiration or pneumonia. Please note the presence of mild
bronchial wall
thickening in the lower lobes and right middle lobe could also
indicate
chronic aspiration, though airways disease/bronchitis is also
considered.




Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia / Septic shock:  Presented with fever and
hypotension and imaging showing infiltrate.  Bronchoscopy with
BAL showed 1+ GNR, 1+ GPR and yeast.  Initially treated with
vancomycin and cefepime with marked improvement.  After 48+
hours afebrile and stable, transitioned to oral regimen.  Given
no GPC on BAL, did not cover staph auerus (MRSA).  Given allergy
to levofloxacin, oral options were more limited; as there had
been improvement without coverage for atypicals, switched to
cefpodoxime alone.  Plan was for 14 days total with follow-up
three days post-discharge.

2. Burkitt's lymphoma:  Felt to be in remission; WBC trended
down during stay with resolved bandemia; LDH was normal.
