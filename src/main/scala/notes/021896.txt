Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
Ms. [**Name (NI) 69876**] was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital in [**9-24**] and again
earlier this month with a partial small-bowel obstruction
proximal to the level of the terminal ileum.  She was discharged
from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2180-1-31**] and presented for an initial
visit with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] yesterday. Since her discharge, her diet
has
consisted entirely of liquid nutritional supplements.  Although
this has reduced her diarrhea from 15 episodes per day to 2, her
abdominal distention has returned.  She has been admitted for
management of a high grade functional small bowel obstruction.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2180-2-7**] - laparotomy, lysis of adhesions, small bowel resection
(25cm)
[**2180-2-12**] - Right nephrostomy inserted in interventional radiology


History of Present Illness:
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 69876**] is a 59-year-old woman who underwent
sigmoidectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy on [**2179-1-8**] for a
large obstructing mass near the rectosigmoid junction.  She had
presented for a colonoscopy after developing small frequent
bowel movements.  Pathology revealed T4 colon adenocarcinoma.
Surgical margins and 26 lymph nodes were negative. Ms. [**Name (NI) 69876**]
was subsequently treated with infusional 5-FU and radiation for
5 weeks from [**Month (only) 956**] to [**2179-3-18**].  On [**2179-5-18**] she began FOLFOX
chemotherapy. Treatment was complicated by the development of
diarrhea, abdominal distention, and 25-lb. weight loss starting
in [**7-24**] and requiring chemotherapy to be postponed on multiple
occasions. She last received chemotherapy on [**2179-12-27**].

Physical Exam:
Vital signs: T 98.2 BP 120/60, P 58, R 18, O2 sat 100% RA
General:  cachectic but in no acute distress.
CV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, minimally distended. Normoactive bowel
sounds present. Liver margin is palpable but non-tender. No
splenomegaly or ascites.

Pertinent Results:
   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2180-2-18**] 4:16 PM
INDICATION: Status post small bowel resection and right ureteral
damage. Please assess fluid collections, urinoma, and damage of
right ureter.
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with small bowel obstruction with a
transition point at the anastomotic site in the pelvis. New
marked edema within a loop of bowel in the left lower quadrant
is potentially concerning for ischemia.
2. Progression of pneumoperitoneum, both free and loculated in a
lower abdominal/pelvic collection with rim enhancement.
3. Right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter with nephrostomy
catheter in place.
4. Anasarca.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions and patchy opacities likely
reflecting infectious or inflammatory process.
6. Probable severe fatty infiltration of the liver.
.
  RADIOLOGY  Final Report
ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT  [**2180-2-3**] 4:23 PM
Reason: 59 yo abd pain r/o obstruccion
IMPRESSION: Probable partial small-bowel obstruction, although
if large-bowel contrast material was introduced from below this
could represent a complete obstruction.
.
   RADIOLOGY
PICC LINE PLACMENT SCH  [**2180-2-4**] 8:54 AM
Reason: please place DL PICC unsuccessfull bedside placement
IMPRESSION: Ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided left brachial
PICC line placement via the left brachial venous approach. Final
internal length is 39 cm with the tip positioned in the distal
SVC. The line is ready to use.
.
   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2180-2-5**] 10:04 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old woman with sigmoidectomy for bowel cancer, now with
high grade SBO
IMPRESSION: Persistent features of mechanical small-bowel
obstruction without evidence for free air or pneumatosis.
.
   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2180-2-6**] 4:50 PM
Reason: BOWEL OBSTRUCTION
FINDINGS:
A Port-A-Cath is seen on the right with the tip in the SVC and
there is a left central venous catheter with the tip at the
distal brachiocephalic vein. No PTX. Left hemidiaphragm is
slightly elevated with an air-filled loop of colon just below
it. There is no focal consolidation and some left basilar
atelectasis is seen on the lateral view. This is accompanied by
posterior effusion likely on the left as well. There is no free
air under the diaphragm.
.
   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
59 year old woman with ureteral injury s/p exlap/LOA, now
draining urine into abdomen.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
placement of R nephrostomy tube
INDICATION: 59-year-old woman with ureteral injury and
hydronephrosis based on recent CT.
IMPRESSION: Ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided right
nephrostomy tube placement for right-sided urinary obstruction
