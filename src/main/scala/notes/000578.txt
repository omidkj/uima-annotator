Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive

Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
 This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of recent ICU stay
for pneumonia who presents unresponsive from her nursing home.
Per EMS notes, patient had a roughly 24 hr decline in MS to the
point that she was unable to take any meds. She arrived via EMS
who had to bag-mask her for airway protection.
.
In the ED, Patient was intubated for airway protection. intitial
vitals were T: 100.3 BP: 155/85 HR: 101 RR: O2Sat: 97% Ambu bag.
CT scan showed consolidation in LLL. Central line was placed and
patient transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Upon arrival patient was hypotensive to 70s/30s with sats in 80s
despite AC 100% fio2, peep 5. Pressors started. CXR showed large
Pneumothorax, presumably from R IJ placement in ED. ED attending
arrived minutes later and placed 14 G angiocath in 2nd
intercostal mid-clavicular line with rush of air. Thoracic
surgery resident arrived and assisted Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11721**] with R chest
tube placement. Repeat CXR with small Pneumothorax, much
improved and patient weaned off pressors.
.
ETT suctioning reveal copious amounts of food indicating
aspiration, probably chronic.
.
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 98899**] was admitted [**Date range (1) 98900**] for respiratory
failure, pneumonia, hypotension and required intubation and
pressors at that time as well.  During that admission, she had
atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and
amiodarone was started. She was only discharged for 8 days when
she presented for this admission.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain as patient intubated.

her last ICU admission, during her approximate 1 week stay at
[**Hospital1 599**], nursing staff reportedly required a [**Doctor Last Name 2598**] lift to
transfer her.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2106-1-3**] 11:50 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue density within the left main bronchus may
represent
aspiration with collapse of the left lower lobe. Small
left-sided pleural
effusion and trace on the right.
2. Multifocal patchy opacities as described above may represent
inflammatory
vs small airway infection.
3. Limited study for the evaluation of the pulmonary embolism
due to poor
opacification of the pulmonary artery without central or
interlobar evidence
of PE.
4. 5 mm lung nodule in the right lower lobe. According to the
[**Last Name (un) 8773**]
society guidelines, in low- risk patient, followup CT at six
months is
recommended.
5. Malpositioned endotracheal tube and NG tube as described
above. Re-
positioning is recommended.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Degenerative changes of the spine with multilevel compression
deformities
as described above.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2106-1-3**] 11:50 AM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology. Brain and medial
temporal
atrophy.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2106-1-3**] 4:04 PM Final Report
CLINICAL HISTORY: 91. New central line placed. Check position.
Patient is considerably rotated. A large right-sided
pneumothorax is present, which may actually cross the midline
and indicate some mediastinal shift.  Medical team informed.
IMPRESSION: Large right pneumothorax.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2106-1-3**] 4:04 PM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-3**]:
Right apical pleural tube still in place. Minimal if any right
apical
pneumothorax and no right pleural effusion. Left lower lobe
atelectasis and a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion are
unchanged since [**1-3**].  There is mild residual edema in
the perihilar left lung. ET tube is in standard placement.
Nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach. No
pneumothorax on the left.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2106-1-20**]
The right apical pneumothorax has now resolved.
Small right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged. Left
retrocardiac atelectasis accompanied by a small-to-moderate
sized left-sided pleural effusion is stable. Mild cardiomegaly
persists.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98899**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of recent ICU
stay for pneumonia who presented to the ED unresponsive with
poor respiratory effort on [**2106-1-3**].  She was found to have LLL
infiltrate.  She was intubated and admitted and treated for
aspiration pneumonia with septic shock.  She had LLL collapse
(or at least partial collapse) and underwent a bronchoscopy.
Her course has been complicated by a tension pneumothorax on
[**2106-1-3**] after central line placement with transient hypotension
prior to decompression.  She had a Chest tube placed [**1-3**] and
removed [**1-16**].  Her initial antibiotic regimen included
vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole.
.
She was intubated from [**2106-1-3**] through [**2106-1-16**] and initially
required pressors for BP support. While her aspiration pneumonia
was felt to have improved, she was felt to develop a Ventilator
Acquired Pneumonia.  Sputum culture has grown pan-sensitive
Klebsiella pneumonia and Methicillin-resistant Staph aureus.
She has been treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin with plans
to continue this course through [**2106-1-24**].

PNEUMONIA - VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED/RECURRENT ASPIRATION:
clinically improved with O2 sat in the high 90s on room air.
--to complete levofloxacin and vancomycin through [**2106-1-24**]
--continue aspiration precautions, HOB > 30 degrees with meals
with supervision, and HOB > 30 degrees after all meals
--thin liquids and ground co
