Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
hepatocellular carcinoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2109-9-6**] liver wedge resection


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 84 y.o. female who presented to her PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 116**]
[**2109**] w/ 25 lb weight loss, fatigue, and anorexia. CT scan showed
a new 2.6 cm isodense lesion with a hypodense rim of right liver
lobe anteriorly. A repeat CT scan on [**2109-7-23**], demonstrated
a 2.5-cm enhancing mass in the inferior aspect of the right lobe
suspicious for neoplasm.  A CT guided liver biopsy was performed
on [**8-2**] and showed a well-differentiated hepatocellular
carcinoma. She was referred to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]  in Oncology who
then referred the patient to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] who had performed
an ERCP in [**2107**] for choledocholithiasis.  A chest CT did not
show evidence of pulmonary metastases.  An abdominal CT
demonstrated a 3.0 x 3.0 cm heterogeneous lesion within segment
5 of the liver where there is an arterial enhancement and subtle
delayed phase washout consistent with biopsy-proven HCC. In
segment 7, there was an 11 x 8 mm arterial enhancing lesion that
had a slight washout on delayed imaging.  Additional
subcentimeter arterial enhancing lesions throughout the liver
did not show portal venous or delayed phase washout.
Additionally in segment 7, there was a 1.8 x 1.3 cm flash
filling hemangioma and a 4mm round hypodensity in segment 6,
likely a cyst.  Her LFTs were: AST 20, ALT 12, alk  phos 50,
total bili 0.3, AFP 1.7 and CA19-9 6.  Hepatitis serologies were
all nonreactive. The patient underwent further workup in
preparation for
surgical resection. PFTs were obtained because of her extensive
smoking history, and showed: FEV1 of 0.86 (76% predicted), FVC
1.39 (77% predicted) and FEV1:FVC 62 (99% predicted).  She was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4512**]from Pulmonary who felt that she was
at moderately increased risk for pneumonitis and/or respiratory
failure and prolonged ventilation postoperatively.  A
dipyridamole stress thallium demonstrated normal myocardial
perfusion with no areas of
ischemia.  There was normal wall motion with normally calculated
ejection fraction of 74%.  An echocardiogram was obtained and
showed mild pulmonary hypertension with pressures of 44 mmHg and
with a normal EF of 65%.  There was
no abnormality in the right or left ventricular function. She is
to undergo a hepatic resection after providing informed consent.

Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hepatobiliary service on
[**2109-9-6**] after undergoing a segment 5 mass resection with
intraoperative ultrasound. In the operating room, she received
3000 mL crystalloid, 1 unit of packed red cells and made 270 mL
of urine. She tolerated the procedure well. She was NPO,
received IV dilaudid for pain control and was on maintenance IV
fluids. On POD 1, she was advanced to sips and restarted on her
home medications. She complained of some intermittent nausea
that resolved. On POD 2, her IV fluids were discontinued and she
was advanced to a clear liquid diet. On POD 3, her foley was
discontinued, she ambulated out of bed, and was put on a regular
diet, which she tolerated well. On POD 4, she passed flatus and
had a loose bowel movement. Her wound remained clean, dry, and
intact, without discharge. She was ready for discharge to home
