Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
left leg infection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Operative Debridement for Necrotizing fasciitis
Cardiac Catheterization
Upper Endoscopy with injection and clipping of esophageal bleed

History of Present Illness:
65 y/o male with a history of sub total colectomy for colon
cancer in [**2101**] who presented to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] hospital with
pimple on left buttock. He was diagnosed with necrotizing
fasciitis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where he underwent
surgical debridement. His post-op course was complicated by
developement of hypotension and a STEMI which is being treated
medically. The patient is now extubated and hemodynamically
stable and therefore is being transferred to the cardiology
service for further management of STEMI.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient reports that he is doing well.
He has some discomfort in the affected groin area that is well
controlled with current pain regimen. He reports that his
breathing has improved significantly from prior.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Other Studies:
Left buttock debridement path report([**2107-10-24**]):
Soft tissue with extensive infiltrating suppurative inflammation
and necrosis, consistent with necrotizing fasciitis.
.
TTE [**2107-10-24**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There seems to be mild to moderate
inferior lateral wall hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %). The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
TTE [**2107-10-25**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near-akinesis of the inferolateral and basal lateral segments
(left circumflex/OM distribution). The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 35-40%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. At least mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis w/o Contrast [**2107-10-25**]:
1. No collection or fistula identified.
2. Bibasilar consolidation and small bilateral pleural
effusions.
3. Trace amount of free fluid within the right paracolic gutter.
No drainable
collections.

[**2107-11-1**] EGD:
Blood was seen in the esophagus. There was a linear
erosion/ulceration from the GE junction to the extending
proximally for 2cm. Active bleeding was seen from the proximal
edge of the lesion. It was felt to be consistent with either a
linear ulcer or [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear. (injection, endoclip)
Furrowing of the mucosa was noted in the mid-esophagus.
Blood in the whole stomach
Blood in the second part of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Cardiac Cath (prelim report) [**2107-10-31**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
revealed
moderate multivessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had a
20% ostial
and 20% mid vessel lesion.  The LAD had moderate calcification
with a
30% ostial, 75% mid vessel occlusion after D2 involving the
origin of
S1.  A mid vessel D2 with a 50% stenosis at the originas well as
slow
flow consistent with microvascular disease is also noted.  The
LCX had a
proximal 30% tubual stenosis, a large OM2/LPL with a proximal
30%
stenosis and tortuous terminal pole.  A modest caliber AV
grossve with
50% stenosis just after the origin of the OM2 and slow flow is
also
noted.  The RCA was mildly calcified with diffuse plaquing
throughout, a
mid vessel 45% stenosis at a large AM2, a large tortuous AM2, a
small
toruous RPL1 and RPL2 arising from large distal AV groove RCA.
Slow
flow is likewise noted.

2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normotensive systemic
arterial pressure of 92/55 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Moderate three vessel coronary artery disease without obvious
culprit
