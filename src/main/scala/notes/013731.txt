Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the West 2A surgery service on
[**2161-10-17**] for small bowel obstruction with a very dilated gastric
remnant, then she had an exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesions, and a gastrostomy tube placement. Postoperatively,
she was still intubated and transferred to the SICU. She was
later extubated without difficulty.

Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. Her bariatric diet was advanced when
appropriate, which was tolerated well. She was also started on a
bowel regimen to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on
POD#3. Intake and output were closely monitored.

ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV Cipro and
Flagyl, then discontinued on POD#4. The patient's temperature
was closely watched for signs of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on POD#5, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a bariatric stage 5
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.
