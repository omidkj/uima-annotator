Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
found unresponsive after not showing up for HD


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 yoM with brittle Type I DM c/b insulin
antibodies, retinopathy & nephropathy, who was found at home
unresponsive with core body temperature of 32 degrees celsius
and a fingerstick glucose of 33 (his home [**Hospital **] clinic called EMS
when he did not show up for his scheduled HD session).  There
was also concern upon arrival he was having a tonic seizure.
Unclear course in the field.

Of note, he has had multiple episodes of severe hypoglycemia
complicated by prfoundly altered mental status.  During the most
recent of these episodes in [**6-/2127**] he was found to be bacteremic
and was treated with two weeks of vancomycin (last dose to be
given [**2127-7-24**] per DCS).  A diagnosis of "bacteremia" was listed
on discharge paperwork; [**Month/Day/Year **] cultures from [**2127-8-18**] grew Staph
epi; subsequent cultures were negative.  He was discharged to
rehab.

In the ED, he was groggy but arousable initially and then had a
tonic clonic seizure.  He was given ativan 1 mg x 2 with seizure
termination, but he was intubated (with rocuronium + etomidate)
for concern for airway protection.  He received an amp of D50 as
well as IV thiamine.  This raised his fingerstick glucose to 175
mg/dl.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
Admission EKG: sinus; no evidence of ST wave changes,
non-specific T wave inversion in V5-6 (not seen on priors)

Admission CXR: ET tube in place; no evidence of infiltrates or
effusions on our read (official read pending).

[**8-30**] N/C Head CT: Probable swelling along the right frontal
scalp. Otherwise, no evidence of skull fracture or acute
intracranial pathology on non-contrast CT. If there is concern
for more subtle intracranial process, [**Month/Day (4) 4338**] would be recommended.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yoM with brittle T1DM, admitted with hypoglycemia,
hypothermia and seizure.
.
# Altered Mental Status: A head CT on admission showed swelling
along the right frontal scalp (chronic based on head CT from
[**7-6**]) w/o evidence of skull fracture or acute intracranial
pathology on non-contrast CT.  Patient was intubated in the ED
and on [**8-30**] patient was extubated when mental status improved.
He was calm at first, but shortly thereafter wanted to leave AMA
and became aggressive towards staff. A code purple called. Pt
was given 5mg IV haldol.  Patient refused all medications while
in the ICU.  Upon transfer to the floor patient was A&Ox3 and
had no further episodes of AMS.  Patient unable to confirm his
home medications, was maintained on meds per OMR notes and
records.
.
#. Hypoglycemia: Patient has had similar episodes in the past
without clear mechanism found.  Infectious work up initially
negative but given concomitant hypothermia patient was placed on
cefepime/vancomycin then switched to levofloxacin/vanc.  Cardiac
enzymes were negative.  [**Last Name (un) **] team consulted and initially
patient kept on lantus 3 units [**Hospital1 **] and D5 drip.  Subsequently
patient maintained on lantus 3U w/ conservative ISS. Upon
transfer to the floor, antibiotics were discontinued and patient
was maintained on conservative ISS.  Fingersticks remained in
200s and patient was discharged on lantus 4U QHS.
.
#. Seizure: in setting of hypoglycemia; no structural
abnormalities on head CT.  Patient had right forehead swelling
but this was also noted on last admission; no evidence of facial
fx on CT.  Patient was monitored and had no further seizure
activity after being admitted to the ICU.
.
#. Diabetes Mellitus: Very brittle at baseline.  While on the
floor patient maintained on lantus 3U w/ conservative ISS and
discharged on lantus 4U QHS (see above). Patient unable to
confirm his home medications, but was continued on prednisone
(per OMR recs) for insulin antibodies was continued.
.
#. ESRD: Patient got one round of HD in ICU [**8-30**]. Remained
hemodynamically stable while on the floors and was continued on
nephrocaps, sevelamer.
.
#. HTN: Patient's home meds were initially held except for
clonidine patch.  BP remained stable 120s. Home
antihypertensives were restarted.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on home rosuvastatin.

#. PVD: Patient was continued on home aspirin
