History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] is a 55 year old man with history of COPD on 3L home
O2, hypertension, diabetes, history of stroke, hypertension, IV
drug use on chronic methadone, history of pancreatitis, history
of PE with IVC ([**2137**]) who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2138-12-27**] for
unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. He was found minimally
responsive at his long-term facility and brought to the ED,
where his O2sat was 71% on 3L NC. He was febrile to 101.6F in
the ED. He was initially given 2mg Narcan and placed on BiPap
with improvement in respiratory status. His respiratory rate
increased after the Narcan. CXR was performed which demonstrated
a RUL pneumonia. He received CTX, Flagyl, and Vancomycin. During
his stay in the ED, he became unresponsive at which time ABG was
7.10/168/356/56; he was again given Narcan with improvement. He
was then transferred to the MICU after moderate improvement.
.
In the MICU, he was initially treated with BiPAP and he was
continued on vancomycin and zosyn for his RUL pneumonia. He
received nebs and prednisone. His Utox was negative except for
opiates. He came off of BiPAP, was stabilized on 3LNC, afebrile,
and breathing comfortably, and was called out to the general
medical floor. His ABG improved to 7.37/77/153/46 at the time of
transfer.
.
Over the preceding days, patient required between 3-6LNC with O2
sats 89-91%. On the morning of transfer, his oxygen saturation
was noted to be low, between 70-mid 80s. He was given a
nebulizer treatment, after which he transiently improved. At
that time he was A+Ox3. A CXR was performed which was showed
improvement in RUL infiltrate. He then became more sedated and
was given 0.4mg ov Narcan with no improvement. At that time, ABG
showed 7.43/70/64/15. His saturation increased on a venti mask
(up to 96% sat), then trended down to 84%. Again, he recovered
spontaneously. He was then noted to be increasingly somnolent
and transiently unresponsive (with no movement and unrousable to
sternal rub); ABG at that time was 7.50/54/83/44. Patient was
then transferred to the MICU.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient is mentating without
difficulty. Alert and oriented x3. States he does not understand
why he needs to be in intensive care. He does remember having
low oxygen this morning but does not remember being unresponsive
or frequent attempted arousals. O2 sat is 86-91% on 6L O2. He
denies any chest pain, pleuritic chest discomfort, palpitations,
leg pain, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, constipation. He
does feel like his breathing is somewhat more difficult than at
home. He notes that he typically only wears his oxygen at night.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
.
ECG [**2138-12-29**]: NSR @ 88. LAD. Nl intervals. LAFB. Delayed RW
progression. Early repolarization changes in inf leads. Compared
to prior, no [**Month/Day/Year 65**] change.
.
CXR [**2138-12-29**]: writers read: improved consolidation in RUL.
.
CXR [**2138-12-28**]: There is interval improvement of the consolidation
within the right upper lobe. There is some atelectasis of the
right base. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is within
normal limits.
.
CXR [**2138-12-26**]: Right upper lobe pneumonia. Repeat radiography
following appropriate therapy recommended to document
resolution.
.
ECHO [**2138-12-5**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is borderline right
ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined (probably at least
mildly elevated but Doppler measurements were technically
suboptimal). There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4401**] is a 55yoM with history of COPD on 3L home O2, DM,
HTN, chronic methadone use admitted with altered MS found to
have hypercapnea and pneumonia. The patient was initially
admitted to the MICU, then transferred to the floor. In the
MICU, he was initially treated with BiPAP and he was continued
on vancomycin and zosyn for his RUL pneumonia. He received nebs
and prednisone. His Utox was negative except for opiates. He
came off of BiPAP, was stabilized on 3LNC, afebrile, and
breathing comfortably, and was called out to the general medical
floor. His ABG improved to 7.37/77/153/46 at the time of
transfer.
.
Over the preceding days, patient required between 3-6LNC with O2
sats 89-91%. On the morning of transfer, his oxygen saturation
was noted to be low, between 70-mid 80s. He was given a
nebulizer treatment, after which he transiently improved. At
that time he was A+Ox3. A CXR was performed which was showed
improvement in RUL infiltrate. He then became more sedated and
was given 0.4mg ov Narcan with no improvement. At that time, ABG
showed 7.43/70/64/15. His saturation increased on a venti mask
(up to 96% sat), then trended down to 84%. Again, he recovered
spontaneously. He was then noted to be increasingly somnolent
and transiently unresponsive (with no movement and unrousable to
sternal rub); ABG at that time was 7.50/54/83/44. Patient was
then transferred back to the MICU.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was mentating without
difficulty. Alert and oriented x3. O2 sat is 86-91% on 6L O2.
After further improvement in his respiratory status, he was
transferred back out the the floor on 3-4L O2.

Hospital Course by problem:

# altered mental status: waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] on floor. Ddx
includes med induced, hypercarbia, seizure, infection,
toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. Patient was back to MS baseline
at time of admission to the MICU. Not clearly related to CO2 and
did not have evidence of worsening CO2 rentention from baseline.
Suspect significant contribution of psychoactive medications
including methadone, gabapentin, zyprexa, theophylline. Should
