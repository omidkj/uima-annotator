HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 95660**] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman with a history of dementia, hypertension, CAD, CHF,
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, who was brought to the
Emergency Room for confusion where she was found to be
hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s as well
as hypoxic and complaining of severe abdominal pain.

Per her [**Age over 90 802**], over the past week, the patient had increasing
confusion and had been unable to perform her ADLs which was
unusual for her.

In the Emergency Room, the patient received 4 liters of IV
fluid, levofloxacin and Flagyl.  She had a CT of the torso
showing a subcarinal mass and bulky mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.  She was also noted to have a large pleural
effusion.  A right main stem pulmonary embolism was also
noted, but not further characterized.

Prior to transfer to the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was
started on a dopamine drip for support of her blood pressure.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs revealed a
blood pressure of 85/60, temperature reported to be 90
degrees rectally, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 15,
saturating at 95% on 4 liters.  In general, somnolent,
talking to herself, acutely ill appearing.  Dry mucous
membranes.  The pupils were 2 mm and sluggish.  Breath sounds
decreased in both lung fields.  No rales or wheeze.  The
heart rate and rhythm were regular with normal S1, S2, no
murmur.  The abdomen was soft with marked right lower
quadrant tenderness.  No guarding, no rebound.  Her
extremities were cool and dry with no edema.  Neurologically,
she did not respond to commands.  Her face was symmetric.

LABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  White count 15.2, 89%
neutrophils, 8% lymphs, 2% monos, hematocrit 36.0, platelets
192,000.  Chem-7 revealed a sodium of 141, potassium 5.5,
chloride 101, bicarbonate 16, BUN 118, creatinine 3.6, up
from 1.6, glucose 34.  ALT 21, AST 74, alkaline phosphatase

IMAGING ON ADMISSION:  Chest x-ray showing large left pleural

CT of the chest:  1.  PE in right main pulmonary artery at
first bifurcation.  2.  Bulky lymphadenopathy with
mediastinum and hilar.  3.  Large left pleural effusion.  4.
Diverticulosis versus diverticulitis.  5.  No aortic aneurysm
or dissection.

CT of the head:  Extensive brain atrophy, no bleed, no mass.

EKG showing normal sinus rhythm at 91, old Q wave in III, no
acute ST changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 95660**] was admitted in an acutely ill
state with a very guarded prognosis.  Given her hypotension
in the setting of likely sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and
cardiac shock, compounded by the fact that she had what
appeared to be newly diagnosed lung cancer on CT scan, her
poor prognosis was conveyed to her health care proxy, her
[**Name2 (NI) 802**], as well as her lawyer who is very involved in her
care.

Supportive care was provided overnight including aggressive
IV antibiotics and IV pressors to maintain her blood pressure
and perfusion.  Overnight, she was able to maintain her
pressure with the support and was confused, but comfortable.
The subsequent morning, contact was reestablished with her
health care proxy and after a long discussion with her, her
lawyer, and the attending on service, the decision was made
that the prognosis was exceedingly grim and that Ms. [**Known lastname 95660**]
would not have wanted to have received invasive procedures if
the chance of return to baseline was as low as it was felt to
be.

After these discussions and documentation of them, supportive
care was withdrawn including antibiotics and pressors.  A
morphine drip was started for comfort and Ms. [**Known lastname 95660**] passed
away subsequently in the next several hours.

Her family was notified and an autopsy was declined.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pulmonary embolism.
2.  Cardiogenic shock.
3.  Sepsis.
4.  Volume depletion.
5.  Acute renal failure.
