SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco, one pack per day.
Occasional alcohol.  No street drugs.  He is married.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the
Catheterization Laboratory after transfer from the outside
hospital.  Please see catheterization report for full
details.  In summary, the catheterization report showed 30 to
40% left main, left anterior descending with minor
irregularities, left circumflex 40 to 50%, right coronary
artery total occlusion and vein graft to the right coronary
artery also totally occluded.  An intra-aortic balloon pump
was placed for hemodynamic stability.  The patient was
transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory to the
Coronary Care Intensive Care Unit.  Also, the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Group was consulted.

An echocardiogram done prior to his catheterization showed an
ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with global hypokinesis,
inferior lateral akinesis, four plus mitral regurgitation.
The patient was consented for surgery and on [**1-4**], was
brought to the Operating Room at which time he underwent a
mitral valve replacement.  Please see the OR Report for full
details.  In summary, the patient underwent mitral valve
replacement with a 29 CarboMedics Mechanical Valve.  He
tolerated the surgery well and was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient had aprotinin, Levophed
and Epinephrine infusing.  He had arterial lines, a Swan-Ganz
catheter and intra-aortic balloon pump in his right groin,
two ventricular and two atrial pacing wires, two mediastinal
chest tubes.

Shortly after arrival in the Intensive Care Unit the patient
was noted to have absent left pulses in his right lower
extremity.  The intra-aortic balloon pump was removed without
a return of his pulses, therefore Vascular Surgery was
consulted.  Following the vascular consult, the patient
returned to the Operating Room where he underwent a right
ilia-femoral embolectomy and patch angioplasty.  He tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred from the Operating
Room back to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At that
time, he had a weak dorsalis pedis pulse by Doppler.

The patient's embolectomy was complicated by compartment
syndrome as evidenced by increasing right calf pain over the
next 12 hours with CPKs that climbed to 12,000.  He continued
to be followed by the Vascular Surgery service.  No
additional interventions were required.

From a Cardiothoracic standpoint on postoperative day one,
the patient was doing well.  He remained hemodynamically
stable.  He was weaned from his Milrinone.  His Propofol was
discontinued.  He was weaned from the ventilator and
successfully extubated.  On postoperative day two, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  His Swan-Ganz
catheter was discontinued.  His chest tubes were removed.
His diet was advanced and he was transferred to the floor for
continuing postoperative care.

On postoperative day three, the patient was noted to have
increasing severity of pain in his right calf.  His right
foot was noted to be cooler than his left foot and Doppler
pulse signals in his right foot were now absent.  Vascular
Surgery was again consulted and he was brought for an
angiogram of his right lower extremity.  The angiogram showed
that he had an occlusion of his distal SFA.  At that time,
they did not want to do any further intervention other than
starting the patient on intravenous heparin.

With the initiation of the intravenous heparin, the patient
slowly regained color and temperature in his foot.  He also
had a faint dorsalis pedis pulse later on during that day.
Over the next several days, the patient remained on bed rest.
His intravenous heparin infusion was continued.  The pain in
his right lower extremity gradually diminished until, on
postoperative day eight, with the guidance of the Vascular
Surgery Service, the patient was allowed ambulation with
assistance of Physical Therapy.

Over the next two days, the patient continued to ambulate
with the assistance of Physical Therapy.  His heparin and
Coumadin were continued.  On postoperative day ten, his INR
was 2.2; his heparin was discontinued and he was felt to be
stable and transfer to rehabilitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of transfer, the patient's
physical examination is as follows:  Vital signs, temperature
97.7 F.; heart rate 66 atrial fibrillation; blood pressure
133/64; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 98% on room air.
Weight preoperatively 96 kilograms; at discharge 96.3
kilograms.  On physical examination, alert and oriented times
three.  Conversant; moves all extremities.  Respiratory:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds are
irregular rate and rhythm; S1 and S2 with loud clicks.
Sternum is stable with staples open to air, clean and dry.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities are warm.  Right leg with Doppler-able
pulses.  Diminishing pain in the right calf.  Right SVG sites
open to air, clean and dry.
