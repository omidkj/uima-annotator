Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 18369**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronch

History of Present Illness:
HPI:  49 yo man w/ known renal cell carcinoma with mets to lung
admitted w/ worsened dyspnea and hemoptysis. Lung mets were
diagnosed [**2171-10-9**] when he had flex bronch for evaluation of
diffuse, bilateral infiltrates, dyspnea, hypoxia in setting on
known renal cell carnicoma. DDx at that time included
lymphangitic spread vs. infection vs toxic reaction, but
bronchial washing and tissue bx showed malignant cells. He is
followed closely by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 15521**] in onc clinic.
He has been on study drug C3 SU11248/Gemzar for 2 cycles with
last dose [**2171-9-18**] but has now progressed on this drug. Pt noted
to have 94% O2sat on RA dropping to 91% with ambulation on last
clinic visit on [**2171-9-25**]. Since bronch, pt has been having
worsening SOB for 3-4 days, pleuritic chest pain, that became
acutely worse last night, after eating a snack (nuts and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Location (un) 2452**]). He denies any aspiration event or emesis. He had
subjective fevers overnight with persistent coughing, called his
PCP who told him to take codeine for cough suppressant and to
try to rest. On day of admission, he still felt unwell and was
told to come to the ER for evaluation. Regarding his hemoptysis,
he reported having "specks" of blood in his sputum which turned
more bright in color on morning of admission. His chest pain is
post tussive and with shallow breathing. Although worse over
last 24 hours, he feels that his breathing has been getting
progressively worse over last few weeks. In [**Name (NI) **], pt with temp
100.6, slight tachy to 109, and sats 90% RA. Concern for PE
warranted evaluation, but given dye allergy/ ARF and abnormal
chest xray, options were limited. LENI dopplers were negative.
Chest CT w/o contrast shows dramatic metastatic lung
progression. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close observation. He received
approx 6 mg total IV morphine w/o significant relief in the ER.
Chest pain is his main discomfort at this time. He has had
orthopnea ([**3-14**] pillow) over last few weeks. This is unchanged.

that time with left renal mass.
--[**2170-7-2**] Left nephrectomy was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49 yo man w/ met renal cell carcinoma to lung now w/
progressive shortness of breath.
*
1. Dyspnea: Pt has known metastatic disease in lungs, secondary
to lymphangitic spread of renal cell CA. This is likely etiology
of hemoptysis and dyspnea, but other possible etiologies include
community acquired or aspiration pneumonia. PE also concern
given malignancy, SOB and tachycardia, but this is very
difficult to evaluate given his ARF/contrast allergy (no CTA)
and abnormal CXR (no v/q). Patient appears clinically well, had
negative LENI's, and is oxygenating well on nasal cannula.
Heparin administration could be difficult, given his hemoptysis
as well. Goal of care was to concentrate on comfort. Patient was
empirically treated for CAP with Levofloxacin 500mg PO q24 hours
and his resp status was closely monitored.
-Sputum cultures were consistent with oropharyngeal flora.
-MDI's prn and antitussives.
-Narcotics will help suppress cough/discomfort as well.
-BNP very low, making CHF unlikely -- exam not consistent w/
this either.
.
2. Fever: As above for resp symptoms. Started Levaquin for
suspected PNA, could be post-obstructive given known mets to
lungs. Lactate 2.5 in ED. No bandemia or signs of sepsis during
admission.
- U/a and cx ordered were negative for UTI.
- Sputum cx as above
.
3. CRI: Baseline creat 1.4-1.7. Likely [**3-13**] nephrectomy, chemo
and possible disease infiltration.
- Patient was hydrated with IVF for possible pre-renal causes.
.
4. Renal Cell CA: Pt last seen in clinic on [**2171-9-25**] per notes
and discussed possible results of bronch. Felt that that
malignant cells seen on bronch indicated treatment failure.
Patient's code status was addressed and patient was full code. A
palliative care consultation with the patient, his wife and his
mother was done and patient was not ready at prese
