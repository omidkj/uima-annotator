History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 54 F with h/o non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, diastolic CHF
with EF >55%, MR, severe pulm HTN thought [**2-21**] UIP/IPF on
steroids, DM2, HTN, PAF on coumadin, s/p renal Xplant in [**2143**] on
IS, who presents from [**Hospital 21970**] Hospital after asystolic arrest.
Per report, the patient presented to [**Hospital 1474**] hospital on
[**2149-8-2**] after feeling sudden onset of palpitations, chest pain,
and SOB. In the ED, she was treated for her CP but was found to
be in pulm edema and rapid afib. She was admitted to the ICU for
further care, where they aggressively rate controlled her and
diuresed her with lasix. Given her rapid afib, the patient was
started on sotalol on [**8-4**], where she converted to sinus rythm
on [**8-5**]. The patient remained stable until the afternoon of
transfer.

Per report, the patient subsequently went into asystolic arrest
at about 2:30PM on [**8-10**] requiring defibrillation, epi 1mg x4,
atropine 1mg x1, vasopressin 40units x1, lidocaine 100mg x1,
Amiodarone 150mg x1, bicarb, Ca returning her to sinus rythm.
There were no reported shocks. She was intubated during this
event and started on dopamine/neo for sbps in the 80s. In the
ICU, a PA line was placed demonstrating CVP 16, PAP 85/35 and
PCWP 40 with CO 1.4. A R fem A-line was placed, as was a temp
pacing wire for bradycardia. The patient was then switched to
nitro/levophed and given lasix 100mg IV x1. Bedside echo showed
EF 40%. ABG at the time of transfer was 7.35/31/60 on 100% Fi02
and PEEP 5. Due to family request, the patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated and sedated with
possible responsiveness. She arrived on nitro/levophed drip. She
was unable to provide history.

Also of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2149-6-12**] for increased abd girth and SOB thought [**2-21**] CHF
exacerbation. She was diuresed at that time with
lasix/metolazone. The patient also underwent R heart cath
confirming pulm hypertension(RVEDP = 20 mm Hg, mean PCWP 11 mm
Hg, pulmonary artery pressure 79/59 mm Hg). She underwent lung
biospy and evaluation by pulmonology showing likely UIP/IPF and
was started on high dose prednisone. She was also maintained on
cytoxan for her renal transplant.

ROS: Unable to obtain review of systems due to patient being
intubated/sedated.

Cardiac History: CABG: N/A

Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2140-10-21**]:
1. Resting hemodynamics demonstrate mildly elevated right heart
filling pressures. The mean RA pressure was 5mm Hg. The RV
systolic pressure was 42mm Hg. The mean wedge pressure was 12mm
Hg. The pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was 42mm Hg, with
an elevated PVR of 200 dynes-sec/cm2. LVEDP was 12mm Hg. The
cardiac index was 4.5 l/min/m2.
2. Coronary arteriography demontrates no siginifcant disease,
with mild luminal irregularities of the LAD.
3. Left ventriculography demonstrates moderate LV dysfunction
with
global hypokinesis. There was moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation.

[**2149-8-10**] CXR: Swan-Ganz catheter remains distally positioned with
the tip projecting lateral to the right hilum, likely within a
segmental branch of the right middle or right lower lobe artery.
Other devices remain in standard position except for a right
PICC line, which crosses the midline to terminate at the
junction of the left brachiocephalic and left subclavian veins.
Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial opacities are again
demonstrated. Alveolar opacities improved on the left but worse
on the right, likely due to rapidly shifting edema, although
superimposed secondary process in the right lung such as
hemorrhage or aspiration is also possible in the appropriate
setting. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged, but
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has increased.

Position of the PICC line and Swan-Ganz catheter have been
communicated by telephone to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20858**] by telephone on [**2149-8-10**]

[**2149-8-10**] CXR: Swan-Ganz catheter projects distal to the right
hilar contour, likely within a proximal segmental vessel of the
right middle or lower lobe. Right PICC line courses medially
within the left brachiocephalic vein with distal tip at the
junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and left subclavian
vein.
Endotracheal tube tip is not well demonstrated, but has been
better visualized on the subsequent radiograph performed 2215
(dictated under clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) 21971**]). Temporary pacing lead terminates
in right ventricle and nasogastric tube courses below the
diaphragm to terminate in the distal stomach near the junction
with the duodenum.

Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and pulmonary vascularity is
engorged. Bilateral combined alveolar and interstitial pattern,
worse on the left than the right probably reflects pulmonary
edema. Small pleural effusions are present as well as
preexisting right-sided pleural thickening.

Position of lines and tubes was discussed by telephone on the
morning of [**2149-8-11**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 21972**].

[**2149-8-10**] ECG:Probable sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia and
extensive baseline artifact. Low voltage in the limb leads. ST-T
