History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 y.o. female w/ history of two liver transplants for
hemochromatosis and EtOH (first in [**2136**], second following
hepatic artery thrombosus in [**2137**]) and ESRD on TuThSa dialysis,
who was transferred from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**7-23**] with abdominal pain and
hematemesis.  The morning of admission, the patient had been
feeling weak with DOE.  She then went to her dialysis

 vomited a large volume of blood. At that time, she was
transfused 2 units, Pantoprazole drip was started and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Studies:
EGD [**7-24**]: Varices at the fundus.  Erythema, congestion and
mosaic appearance in the whole stomach compatible with portal
hypertensive gastropathy. Otherwise normal EGD to second part of
the duodenum

RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION: Normal hepatic echotexture with patent
vessels. Trace free fluid. Splenomegaly to at least 13 cm.

CXR: FINDINGS: Right-sided internal jugular dialysis catheter
terminates with tip in the right atrium. The lungs demonstrate
bibasilar atelectasis and scarring in the left upper lobe. There
is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is normal in
size. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.

EKG: Regular. P wave axis is abnormal. Normal QRS.

Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 55-60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old woman with EtOH cirrhosis s/p two liver transplants
([**2136**] and [**2137**]), ESRD on TuThSa HD here with hemodynamically
significant upper GI bleed and abdominal pain.  Now with
improved abdominal pain and no further episodes of UGI
bleed/melena.

#Upper GI bleed: Patient with history of liver disease and is
s/p two liver txpts.  She reports having an EGD performed
approximately 2 years ago for reasons unrelated to her liver
disease that did not show varices. She presented [**7-23**] following
an episode of hematemis at OSH.  She received 1 unit of blood at
OSH and then an addional 2 units here.  She was also started on
a PPI drip in the ED and a 7 day course of ciprofloxacin.  She
was initially transferred to the MICU, where her HCT remained
stable following transfusion.  An EGD on [**7-24**] revealed
non-bleeding varices at the fundus and portal hypertensive
gastropathy.  Transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 in stable condition on
[**7-25**].  On the floor she remained stable without further
bleeding.

#Hypotenstion: The patient has chronically low blood pressures
in the 70-90s systolic.  She describes even lower BPs during
dialysis.  The patient denies any symptoms related to her low
BP.  In the MICU, the patient was started on midodrine and an AM
cortisol was checked that revealed a level of 4.9, indicating
likely adrenal insufficiency.  She was started on high-dose
hydrocortisone.  The following day, a repeat AM cortisol was
perfomed >12 hours after the prior steroid dose, and the level
was 21.3.  The steroids were stopped and the patient's BP
remained >90 systolic for the remainder of her inpatient stay.
She will be discharged on midodrine.

#Abdominal pain: The patient developed abdominal pain following
her episodes of hematemesis.  Likely related to spasming during
vomiting but also considered ischemia related to low BP.
Lactate was measured to be 1.2 on admission and climbed to 5.5
during her hospital stay.  Unclear etiology, but may be related
to hypotension/ischemia vs. inability to clear lactate due to
ESRD and skipped dialysis sessions while inpatient. The
patient's abdominal pain resolved largely by the end of the
first hospital day.  She was continued on her home doses of
oxycontin.

#ESRD: The patient developed ESRD during her prior admission in
early [**2144**].  On 3x weekly dialysis.  She was dialysed as an
inpatient on [**2144-7-27**].

#Fall: The patient frequently left the floor for extended
periods of time during her inpatient stay.  Often left to smoke
despite counseling.  During one trip on the night of [**7-25**], the
patient tripped and fell causing a laceration above her left eye
that required 3 sutures by surgery and a Head CT.  The head CT
did not reveal any ICH.  She will require suture removal by her
PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 2974**], [**7-31**].

#Liver transplant: Continued cellcept and sirolimus. No active
issues.

#Possible PE: The patient was started on warfarin x3 months
during her last admission due to a possible PE. She reported
being on warfarin at home at admission although was
subtherepeuticwith [**Name9 (PRE) 263**] 1.3.  As an inpatient, coumadin w
