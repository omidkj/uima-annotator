History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 76783**] is a 56 yo f with COPD on 2L home O2 who was
brought in by ambulance when found cyanotic by daughter at home.
 Had altered mental status today and was not answering the phone
when her daughter called.  She was intubated in the field for an
O2 sat in 60's with bp 220/110.  Per family patient had 3 week
hx of uri/copd exacerbation sx and was treated with po
prednisone until about 1 week ago.  Was again prescribed
prednisone 60mg qd and levoquin on tuesday by her pcp.

In ED, patient was febrile 101.2 rectal HR 130 BP 144/91 RR 12
100% on bag ventilation.
She was treated with combivent, solumedrol 125mgx1, 1L NS,
Ceftriaxone 1g IV, Azithromycin 500mg IV.
Propofol bolus was given for agitation and patient's blood
pressure dropped to 73/50, propofol was turned off and ivf bolus
was given.  One hour later bp dropped again with no response to
fluid resuscitation.  Levophed started.

Of note, pt did recieve influenza vaccine and pneumovax

Pertinent Results:
Labs:

Microbiology:
[**4-9**] sputum: MRSA.
[**4-10**] BAL: MRSA, AFB negative.
[**4-11**] sputum: MRSA.
[**4-11**] flu: positive for influenza A.
[**4-20**] BAL: MRSA, pan-sensitive Klebsiella.
[**4-25**] Pleural fluid: gram stain 4+ PMNs, no organisms, culture
negative.
[**4-9**], [**4-22**] blood: negative.

Cytology:
[**4-10**] bronchial washings: negative.
[**4-/2094**] [**Doctor Last Name **] needle biopsy: positive for malignant cells c/w poorly
differentiated non-small cell carcinoma.

Imaging:
[**4-9**] Initial CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Extensive right upper lobe consolidation consistent
with
pneumonia.  Question of possible cavitary lucency within the
right upper lobe.
Serial CXRs demonstrated persistent right upper lobe
consolidation and eventual opacification of nearly the entire
right hemithorax due to consolidation and progressive pleural
effusion.

[**4-10**] Chest CT:
1)  Large consolidation in the right upper lobe with bulky
mediastinal and
right hlar lymphadenopathy.  These findings together with the
narrowing of the segmental right upper lobe bronchi raise the
differential diagnosis of bulky reactive nodes from an
infectious process vs. a post-obstructive pneumonia due to
neoplastic process. Further evaluation of the patient with
bronchoscopy and/or close follow-up with chest CT in [**4-18**] weeks
after antibiotic therapy is reccomended.
2)  Moderate dependent right pleural effusion.
[**4-20**]/ Chest CT:
1) Worsening right upper lobe bronchial obstruction with
complete right upper lobe collapse.  Increase in bulky
mediastinal and right hilar adenopathy. Increase in size of
right pleural effusion with new small left pleural effusion.
Findings are concerning for neoplasm such as primary lung cancer
with postobstructive changes in right upper lobe.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 76783**] is a 65 yo female with a history of COPD (FEV1
0.81 liters/37% predicted) who presented with respiratory
distress.

1. Respiratory distress:
Her respiratory distress was thought to be due to a combination
of pneumonia (MRSA on sputum [**4-9**], klebsiella on BAL [**4-20**]),
influenza (positive influenza A [**4-11**]), her underlying COPD, and
a non-small cell lung cancer and associated right sided effusion
discovered during this admission.  She was intubated in the
ambulance on her way to the ED and remained intubated until [**5-1**]
(see below).  Her MRSA pneumonia was treated with vancomycin and
her klebsiella was treated with a seven day course of
levofloxacin.  Her COPD was treated with albuterol, atrovent and
steroids.  Her NSCLCa was treated with five doses of palliative
XRT (finished [**4-30**]).  Her right effusion which was thought to be
due to her malignancy was treated first with a therapeutic
thoracentecis ([**4-25**]) and eventually IP was consulted to place a
pleurex catheter ([**4-29**]) for continued drainage.  Despite all of
this treatment she required excessive settings on the ventilator
including FiO2 up to 70% and a PEEP of 15 to keep her O2 sat in
the 90s.  Eventually both she and her family decided to extubate
her (see below).

2. Dispo:
Multiple family discussions were had both with Mrs. [**Known lastname 76783**] and
her family about her course and prognosis.  Her combination of
severe COPD, pneumonia, and the new diagnosis of NSCLCa with
likely malignant pleural effusion made it very difficult to wean
her off the ventilator.  She made it clear that she would not
like to have a tracheostomy and that she would like to have some
time extubated to talk with her family.  She also was clear that
she would not like to be re-intubated if necessary.  Thus on
[**5-1**] she was extubated and started on a morphine drip.  She
passed away on [**5-2**] at approximately 4:45 pm.
