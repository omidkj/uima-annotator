Carotid Bruit        Right: no   Left: no

Pertinent Results:
[**2171-4-30**] Carotid U/S: Moderate heterogeneous plaque at the ostia
of both internal carotid arteries. This together with the
findings on the peak systolic and diastolic velocities suggests
a 40-59% stenosis on both sides. However, this is clearly much
closer to 40%.  The vertebrals are unremarkable.
.
[**2171-4-30**] Echo: Pre-Procedure: No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic [**Month/Day/Year 5236**]. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. The
IABP is well-positioned in the proximal descending [**Month/Day/Year 5236**].
Post-Procedure: The patient is in SR, on no inotropes. Preserved
biventricular systolic fxn. No AI, trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5235**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39428**] is 77 year old male with history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, status post angioplasty
20 yo with a negative pharmacologic stress test last year,
presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] complaining of substernal
chest pain on [**2171-4-22**]. Further cardiac workup revealed
multivessel coronary artery disease (55% prox RCA,MCA-60%
OSTIAL, LAD-80%PROX). He was transferred to BIDMCfor evaluation
of coronary revascularization.

During the pre-operative period he developed chest pain and an
intra-aortic balloon pump was placed and he was subsequently
taken urgently to the operating room where he underwent Urgent
off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x3:  Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending artery; saphenous vein graft
to obtuse marginal and distal right coronary arteries (see
operative note for details).
Post operatively he was admitted to the ICU intubated and
sedated requiring milrinone and neo for hemodynamic support.
Hemodynamic support was weaned off and Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed. He awoke somewhat anxious
and was extubated requiring moderate pulmonary toilet due to
extensive pulmonary history and Bipap support. He was started on
statin, betablocker and ASA therapies. Plavix was started due to
his off pump CABG but was later discontinued when he was started
on coumadin for afib. Post-operative afib was started on
amiodarone and coumadin therapy. He converted to sinus rhythm.
He had baseline CRI and developed post-op ATN. Nephrotoxic drugs
were d/c'd and renal was consulted. His creat peaked at 3.7 and
is down to 2.8 at the time of his discharge today. Low dose po
lasix is ordered to begin on [**2171-5-8**] and his bun/creat and K
should be checked everyother day while on diuretic therapy.
He was evaluated by Physical therapy for strength and
conditioning and rehab was recommended.
