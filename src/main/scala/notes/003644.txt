Date of Birth:  [**2080-7-26**]        Sex:  M

Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 78-year-old male
with a past medical history of seizure disorder, found by
family at the bottom of the stairs unconscious with seizure
activity.  Patient failed field intubation and was made an
oral airway, bagged with an O2 saturation of 98 percent.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 2561**], where he
was intubated and stabilized.  Head CT demonstrated bilateral
subarachnoid hemorrhage and subdural hematoma.  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department as a hemodynamically stable patient.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD.
2. Seizure disorder.
3. Bladder cancer in [**2153**] status post urostomy.
4. Status post femoral bypass.


ALLERGIES:  None.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Dilantin.
2. Lamictal.
3. Aspirin.

Upon admittance to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center, physical exam
showed systolic blood pressure of 218/106, O2 saturation was
99 percent.  Respiratory rate was 20.  Heart had a regular,
rate, and rhythm, S1, S2 present, no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Bowel sounds times four.  His lungs were clear bilaterally,
and his extremities had no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
HEENT:  Right eye bruise with swelling.  No other lacerations
or battle signs.  Neurological exam:  Patient opens eyes to
voice, moves arms to command, squeezed left hand to command.
Pupils were 4 to 3 mm reactive bilaterally.  Does not blink
to visual threat.  No facial asymmetry.  Positive corneal and
gag reflex.  His motor activity:  He moves upper extremities
to antigravity.  No lower extremity movement.  Sensory:
Withdraws to pain in the left lower extremity only.  Reflex:
Trace.  Left lower extremity reflex with muscle, mute toes
bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He is a 78-year-old man with a fall
secondary to seizure now with bilateral subdural hematomas
and subarachnoid hemorrhage without midline shift.
Assessment and plan for this patient at this time was to keep
his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 140, hourly
neurologic checks.  He was given mannitol 50 grams q.4h.
Check q.4h. serum sodium and osmolality.  He was given
Dilantin 500 mg times one.  Recheck Dilantin one hour after
bolus.  Hyperventilated with goal pCO2 between 32 and 35.  He
was administered Solu-Medrol per Spine protocol.

MRI of the spine per trauma protocol with possible MRI of the
brain.  A stat noncontrast head CT was ordered for four
hours.  He was given 10 bags of platelets.  Held all aspirin
and he was at full code at this point.

On [**2159-3-23**], the patient's vital signs were a temperature of
98.8, pulse was 63 and 114, his blood pressure was 100/54,
and his respiratory rate was between 22 and 25.  He was
ventilated, and his O2 saturation was 98 to 100 percent.  He
was on propofol 50 mcg/kg/minute.  At this time, the patient
was localizing the pain in the upper extremities only.  His
pupils were 3 to 2 mm bilaterally.  Slight left outward eye
deviation.  Toes mute.  No movement in the lower extremities.
No reflex.

The assessment and plan at this time:  He was under sedation.
Plegic in the lower extremities.  We wanted to keep his blood
pressure between 100 and 140.  Hourly neurologic checks.
PCO2 between 33 and 35.  Keep him euvolemic.  Serum
osmolality q.4h.  If less than 320, given him mannitol.
Continue Solu-Medrol times 24 hours, subQ Heparin tonight,
serial hematocrits.

On [**2159-3-27**], he spiked a fever at 102.8.  His systolic blood
pressure was 110-146/51-66.  His heart rate was between 73
and 129.  His respiratory rate was between 24 and 37.  His
pupils were trace reactive to ambient light.  He was moving
his upper extremities spontaneously.  No lower extremity
movement at this time.

His assessment and plan:  Neurologically no change.  Replaced
TC from oral A line.  He was to have a full fever workup,
chest x-rays, correct the sodium with free water, and the
plan was to talk to the family at this time.

On [**2159-3-28**], on Neurosurgery, his temperature was 101.7.  His
pulse was between 88 and 101.  Respiratory rate was between
21 and 36.  He was intubated and saturating between 93 and 99
percent.  His eyes were closed.  He localized to pain on the
left.  Right arm flexed posture versus localized.  Pupils 3
mm reactive to ambient light.  Paraplegia of the legs.

Assessment and plan:  CT of the head shows evolving
subarachnoid hematoma with contusions.  There is minimal mass
effect.  Awaiting family discussion regarding CMO status.
The goal is to keep his blood pressure below 140.

Later on [**2159-3-28**], attending in the Trauma ICU spoke with the
family and explained the developments in his case.  They told
me that the patient had often expressed a strong desire not
to be kept alive if he would be physically impaired.  They
asked that the patient be removed from mechanical ventilation
and made comfort measures only.  In light of his grim
prognosis, I agree that this is a reasonable course.

At 10 p.m., the patient was pronounced dead by Trauma
attending physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 10 p.m.  He was without
spontaneous respirations, no heart activity on telemetry.
Exam confirms no breath sounds, heart sounds.  Pupils were
fixed and dilated.  No brain stem functions.
