Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo m with HTN, CHF, CAD, p/w N/V/D found to be
septic.
.
1) Sepsis: The patient was admitted with leukoctyosis, lactate
elevation to 2.4 and fever. Initially there was question of PNA,
thought to be aspiration given his h/o vomiting and the patient
had a dirty urine with > 50 leukocytes. The patient was found to
be profoundly volume depleted and was resuscitated with IVF.
He was empirically started on Vanc/levo/flagyl for broad
coverage, including MRSA given pt's history, aspiration
pneumonia, and likely UTI. Legionella antigen was negative.
Blood, sputum, and urine cultures were sent. After the
aforementioned interventions, the patient's BP normalized and
the patient quicklyl defervesced. After 48 hrs, blood and sputum
cultures were negative but urine culture grew out coag positive
staph aureus. Sensitivities are pending. Given the patient has
not spiked in house, and has no other clinical signs of PNA,
coverage for asp PNA was stopped. We will continue the
vancomycin for possible MRSA in his urine. This should be
continued for ten days or until sensitivities suggest otherwise.
C.diff is also pending upon discharge. This will also need to be
followed up and flagyl restarted if positive.
.
2) conjunctivitis: The patient was noted to have erythemetous
conjunctiva L>R and was started on erythromycin eye drops. This
should be continued for a seven day course.
.
3) Anemia: The patient has a normocytic anemia with a HCT today
of 25.8. The patient was found to have guaiac + stools. However,
the family does not with to pursue any diagnostic procedures and
would like to minimize any interventions. Therefore, we did not
work the anemia up any further.
.
4) CAD/CHF: After aggressive fluid resuscitation the patient
briefly experienced pulmonary edema and was put on a NRB with
sats in the mid 90's. He was given lasix and was taken of the
NRB mask and transitioned to 6L 02 via NC with SaO2 100%. The
patient's aspirin was discontinued as his stool was found to be
guaiac positive and his HCT was 25.8 with a baseline crit in
high 20s low 30s.
.
5) HTN: Initially the pt's Toprol and amlodapine were stopped
given his hypotension. However, the patient was given 5mg Toprol
IV prn for hypertension as he was unable to take PO medications
and the family did not want an NGT placed. The amlodapine was
not continued. The patient was discharged on no BP meds.
However, metoprolol IV may be needed in the future for blood
pressure control as the patient continues to recover from his
infections.
.
6) Elevated trop: The patient's CK's and Trops were elevated
upon admission, but MBs were negative. EKG did not show evidence
of ischemia. Therefore, the elevated trops were likely secondary
to increased demand in the setting of renal failure and severe
hypotension.
.
7) Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's most recent Cr
prior to admission was 1.3 in [**2092**]. He was initially thought to
be pre-renal in setting of sepsis with FENa<1%. However, his cr
did no
