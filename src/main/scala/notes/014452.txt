Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Benadryl / Morphine / Ativan / Compazine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1781**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal discomfort; non-healing Right 1st toe amputation site

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2166-1-31**]: Diagnostic right lower extremity arteriogram via
antegrade right axillofemoral approach. Percutaneous balloon
angioplasty of the posterior tibialis, tibioperoneal trunk and
below-the-knee popliteal


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 108560**] is a 64 year old male a complicated past medical
history (including CAD/CHF/ESRD/PVD, among others) who presented
to the ED on [**1-23**] with nausea and pressure in his
abdomen/chest. The patient states that he was in his usual state
of health until yesterday when he felt a little off - he cannot
clarify further what was wrong. He awoke this morning and felt
nauseated; had some dry heaves with spit production - no blood.
Also felt a pressure on his chest and abdomen (he points to
epigastrum and lower chest). Different from his pancreatitis
pains. This pressure did not radiate anywhere and was not
worsened by deep breathing or anything else. He does say that he
has some SOB ("can't take a deep breath") but this is unrelated
to pain. Reports a cough since this morning, productive of
yellow sputum. Denies fevers/chills.

In the ED, vitals were: 98.0, BP 140/90, HR 80, 94% on room air.
Blood pressures were as high as 180s systolic in the ED.
Was given: ceftriaxone 1g IV, azithromycin, [**Last Name (LF) 28920**], [**First Name3 (LF) **],
reglan.

On HOD #1 on the medicine floor, the patient received compazine
and ativan approximately 45 minutes prior to having a change in
mental status. The patient became increasing somnolent. BP and
HR were stable and glucose 150's. An ABG was 7.35/59/238. EKG
was unchanged. Last HD was [**2166-1-22**].
.
In the MICU, patient was put on Bipap which he usually uses at
home. Mental status cleared within 5 hours and was thought to be
due to medications (ativan and compazine) he received on the
floor. He was back to his baseline mental status and was
transferred back to floor.
.
On admission to floor, patient was alert and oriented, asking
for pain medication for his feet. He denied dizziness, headache,
chest pain, sob, abdominal pain, mild nausea, no vomiting,
constipation, no diarrhea. C/O B/L lower extremity pain.

Imaging:
[**2166-1-23**] 10PM CXR -diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema
[**2166-1-23**] 10AM CXR - Likely multifocal pneumonia and mild
congestive heart failure
[**2166-1-23**] 8:30AM CXR - Bilateral patchy infiltrates likely
consistent with multifocal pneumonia.

[**2166-1-23**] CTA Abd/Pelvis -
Reason: eval for aortic disection, mesenteric ischemia
1. Patchy consolidations at the lung bases along with a large
hiatal hernia likely represents aspiration pneumonia.
2. No evidence of aortic dissection or mesenteric ischemia.
3. Unchanged appearance of left inguinal and umbilical hernias.
4. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.
5. Changed appearance of the femoral-femoral bypass graft of
which only the left portion is visible without evidence of
contrast within the graft. This patient had a bypass revision in
this region. ?
6. Unchanged appearance of both kidneys with multiple cysts,
likely representing lithium toxicity.
7. Polychamber cardiomegaly.

[**2166-1-23**] CT HEAD - No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Lateral ventricles are normal in size configuration and are
unchanged from the prior examination.

[**2166-1-28**]  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
Reason: Assess for abscesses in abdomen
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal occult abscess.
2. Stable appearance to bilateral patchy basal lung
consolidation.
3. Unchanged bowel containing left inguinal and umbilical
hernias with no evidence of incarceration or obstruction.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
5. Unchanged bilateral cystic kidneys, as mentioned on prior
reports may represent lithium toxicity
