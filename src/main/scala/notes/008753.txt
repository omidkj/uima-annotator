[**2166-4-30**] CT abd/pel: Large intermediate density
subhepatic/gallbladder fossa fluid collection with internal air
pockets and a thin enhancing rim, consistent with an abscess.
Additional smaller fluid collections in the right perihepatic
space, likely communicate with the larger abscess. A linear
track extends down to the right flank, with a smaller right
anterior abdominal wall fluid collection, at the site of the
previously placed drains.

[**2166-5-1**] CT-guided drainage: 8 French pigtail [**Last Name (un) 2823**] drainage
catheter inserted. A total of 150 cc of purulent material was
aspirated into
the bag at the time of the procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the West 3 surgery service on
[**2166-4-30**]. He was initially admitted to the ICU due to a blood
sugar of 532, and required an insulin drip. He was started on
vanc/zosyn for broad antibiotic coverage. On HD2, patient's
wound was opened slightly at the bedside to improve drainage.
The patient went to IR to have CT guided drainage of his
peri-hepatic abscess. (Please see procedure note for further
details.) A drain was placed by IR and left to bag drainage.
This put out large amounts of purulent fluid. Overnight on
[**2166-5-1**], patient's urine output began to drop substantially. He
received fluid boluses along with a unit of PRBCs with no
improvement in his Uop. Cr increased to 2.3 on HD2, and
nephrology was consulted. He was started on Regular diet on HD2
which was well tolerated. Due to significant cardiac history,
and EKG was checked, which was not different from baseline.
Enzymes were cycled that also were not concerning for acute
ischemic event. On [**5-2**], Zosyn was changed to meropenem. Due to
renal failure, [**Month/Year (2) **] troughs were checked daily and
[**Month/Year (2) **] was dosed appropriately. On [**5-3**] he was transfused 1
u pRBCs for an HCT of 26.3. Geriatrics was consulted for advice
on management of cardiac issues and diabetes. Nephrology was
consulted for management of acute kidney injury and volume
status. Throughout the course of hospitalization, urine output
improved and creatinine decreased (to 1.2 by [**5-8**]). Nutrition
was consulted and found dietary intake to be adequate; insulin
drip was discontinued. On [**5-3**] the abdominal wound incision was
extended laterally 2 cm and a Penrose drain was placed. On [**5-4**]
