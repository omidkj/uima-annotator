CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
female, transferred from an outside hospital, with a history
of abdominal pain, status post aorta celiac SMA bypass for
mesenteric ischemia in [**2154-7-8**]. Status post right
axillobifemoral in [**2155-7-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
patient complained at the outside hospital of six weeks of
post prandial abdominal pain and upper gastrointestinal
bleeding. The patient did receive 10 units of packed red
blood cells at the outside hospital.  The patient was
subsequently discharged from the outside hospital but
continued with the lower abdominal pain. The patient was then
referred to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Peripheral vascular disease.
2.  Aortic insufficiency.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Status post myocardial infarction.
6.  Status post left carotid stenosis.
7.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
8.  History of fecal impaction.
9.  History of upper gastrointestinal bleeds.
10. Status post axillo-bifemoral in [**7-10**].
11. Status post aorta celiac SMA bypass graft, [**7-9**].

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dilaudid PCA.
2.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Compazine 5 mg intramuscular q. six hours prn.
4.  Senokot.
5.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Nitropaste one inch q. six hours prn for a blood pressure
greater than 140.
7.  Folate 1 mg p.o. q. day.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin and Erythromycin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  97.9; 180/80; 80; 20 and 94% on room
air.  No acute distress.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Clear to
auscultation.  Abdomen:  Soft, positive bowel sounds.
Negative peritoneal signs.  No inguinal hernias.  Initial
pulses:  Carotid bruits bilaterally; radials +2; femorals
Dopplerable; dorsalis pedis Dopplerable on the right;
posterior tibial Dopplerable bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
with question of mesenteric ischemia and was followed by the
vascular service.  The patient had an uneventful course.
Gastrointestinal was consulted for an evaluation and
recommended a GoLYTELY prep and a colonoscopy.  During that
time, a duplex of the axillo-bifemoral showed a patent
axillary conduit to the femoral outlet.  It did show an
occluded left femoral crossover.  The patient was initially
continued n.p.o. and had TPN for nutrition.

General surgery was consulted for an evaluation for a feeding
tube.  It was decided that the patient, when ready, could
receive a gastric tube placement via general surgery and/or
IR.  The patient was transitioned from TPN to N-J tube
feedings without complications. Prior to the colonoscopy, the
patient went into flash pulmonary edema and required
Intensive Care Unit monitoring. During that time, a central
line, A line and an endotracheal tube was placed.  Cardiology
was consulted and initially thought that the patient's flash
pulmonary edema was secondary to cardiac diastolic
hypertension. The patient's course in the Intensive Care Unit
was initially uneventful.  On the [**7-27**], the patient
became hypotensive with a metabolic acidosis.  The acidosis
worsened and the patient became hyperdynamic.  Aggressive
volume resuscitation was initiated.  At that time, it was
thought that the patient's axillo-bifemoral may have clotted
off.  During that time, it was also thought that the
patient's SMA may also have clotted off.  Aggressive
resuscitation was continued.  The patient's acidosis did not
improve and her lactate continued to rise.  It was decided
that the patient would have an angiogram done through
interventional radiology to evaluate the SMA.  Prior to the
angiogram, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest.  ACLS was
initiated.  CPR, epinephrine, calcium, magnesium, Lidocaine
and cardioversion were attempted to revive the patient.
These attempts were unsuccessfully and the patient expired at
6:25 p.m.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the family were notified.
