History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38669**] is a 68 year old man with HCV cirrhosis on transplant
list MELD 27, AF, and portal vein thrombosis on coumadin
admitted with fever, abd pain and LE pain and rash. Per wife,
patient reported intermittent periumbilical abdominal pain x 1
week and fatigue/lethargy x 1 day. This am, wife found patient
in bed where he stated he had severe [**10-4**] LE pain like "being
stabbed with 1000 knives". He also was diaphoretic, slightly
confused and had new rash on LEs associated with fever to 102.5
and chills. Abd pain and HA at this time were [**2178-4-30**]. He was
taken to ED by ambulance. He had not had recent N/V/D, prior
confusion, melena, hematochezia, new cough, SOB or sick
contacts.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 102.5 84 119/49 22 1002L. Patient
was given 2.5L NS, tylenol, total 6mg IV morphine per report,
Ceftriaxone for possible SBP, Cipro for possible intra-abd
process, Vanco for possible cellulitis and underwent U/S which
was unremarkable. When he returned from U/S, he was altered and
minimally responsive as well as tachypneic but not hypoxic and
was intubated with 8.0 ETT for airway protection. He was also
given 2 units FFP in case of procedure but CT A/P was without
ascites so did not have para. Also noted to have trace 50cc
blood from OGT after placement which cleared but clot and type
and cross sent. LENIS negative. Prior to transfer, head CT
obtained which was unremarkable and LENIS negative for DVT. VS
97.6 76 92/59 100% on AC 50% 14x500 PEEP 5.
.
He was extubated and transfered to the floor.

LENI [**6-17**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of bilateral lower extremity DVT.
.
TTE [**6-18**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. No
vegetations identified.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
.
TEE [**6-19**]
The left atrium is dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque to 34 cm from the incisors. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Mild mitral and tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
CT LEs [**6-18**]
1. Non-specific diffuse soft tissue edema in the bilateral lower
extremities,
left greater than right. Infection cannot be excluded. Clinical
correlation
is advised. There are superficial dermal fluid collections on
the left
compatible with bulla formation. No deep fluid collection or
soft tissue air.
2. Status post left knee arthroplasty, with moderate left knee
joint
effusion. No evidence for hardware-related complication.
3. Tricompartmental degenerative change of the right knee.
4. Bilateral osteochondral lesions of the talar domes.
5. Marked atherosclerotic calcification.
.
MRI LEs [**6-18**]
1. Extensive soft tissue edema in the bilateral lower
extremities, with fluid seen tracking along the deep fascial
planes. This is a nonspecific finding, and can be seen with both
third spacing and fasciitis. Infectious etiologies cannot be
excluded. There is no evidence of soft tissue air, though CT is
more sensitive. Clinical correlation is advised.
2. Dermal bullous change in the bilateral lower extremities.
