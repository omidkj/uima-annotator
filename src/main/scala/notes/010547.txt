On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were T: 98.3 BP: 116/67 HR:
80 rr: 28 sp02: 99% on BIPAP 5/5. Pt desaturated to 80s when
mask removed to deliver nebulizer and cpap reinstituted. Pt
alert and oriented. Does c/o pain at incision site. Lung sound
rhonchi and wheezes throughout. Sp02 97% on BIPAP. RR in high
20??????s to low 30??????s at times. The patient became hypotensive with
SBP high 80s, so was given 1 L NS.


Past Medical History:
-Renal Cell Ca: Diagnosed and resected his R kidney mass in [**2141**]
after the mass was found incidentally on CT scan. A 14.5 cm soft
tissue mass was found on follow up CT scan in [**2151**], which was
resected. He also had a VATS RU lobectomy in [**2158-7-7**]. In [**2156**]
CT scan showed RUL lung mass, which was resected. He also had
pancreatic involvement. Recently, he experienced leg pain and
was found to have a L femer met. His cancer has been overall
growing slowly, and prior to surgery he experienced great
quality of life and was very active.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo M w/ HTN and metastatic renal Ca (to lung, chest wall,
pancreas, femur) was transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after left femur
rodding procedure for tachpnea and hypoxemia.

# Post-surgical hypoxemia and tachypnea - Differential diagnosis
included pulmonary edema, tranfusion relation blood injury,
negative pressure pulmonary edema.  Patient improved with
diuresis.  CT chest revealed infiltrates in lower lung bases,
but with the absence of clinical symptoms including cough,
fever, leukocytosis, he was not treated for pneumonia. CTA
performed and b/l LE dopplers were negative. Initially on BIPAP,
transitioned to nasal canal.

# A. fib/tachycardia: Rated controlled on diltiazem gtt,
transitioned to diltiazem XR 120mg po. Given conversion back to
NSR, not need to anti-coagulation.

Post operative has been doing well however has failed 3 voiding
trials and has required an extended duration foley (5-7 days) as
well as a lingering oxygen requirement with exhertion - Home or
Rehab O2 PRN. After trying to arrange for Home care he has
elected to go to a rehab facility
