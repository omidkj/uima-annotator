[**2157-8-4**] CTA Neck: 1. Nonopacification of V2 segment of right
vertebral artery closely abutting site of right submandibular
laceration is highly concerning for dissection or intimal
injury.
2. Apparent contrast extravasation within superficial right
submandibular
laceration and post surgical exploration site (3, 167), possibly
contiguous with adjacent venous  structures.
3. Short segment left internal jugular vein non-opacification
below the
jugular foramen may indicate vascular injury with thrombosis.
4. Multiple stab wounds and extensive superficial and deep soft
tissue
emphysema including air extending within the danger space into
the
mediastinum.
5. Bilateral pneumothorax with chest tubes in place. Small right
hemothorax.

[**2157-8-3**] CT Chest :
1. No vascular or solid organ injury identified. Predominantly
simple fluid noted within the abdominal cavity with slightly
denser fluid noted within the pelvic cavity. While this may
simply reflect third spacing from vigorous fluid resuscitation,
occult mesenteric or bowel injury cannot be entirely excluded
although.
2. Small right and minimal left remaining pneumothoraces with
bilateral chest tubes in place of which the right is partially
intrafissural and the left has portions completely surrounded by
lung likely related to lung collapsed around the tube within the
pleural space (less likely the tube may be partially
intraparenchymal in location).
3. Bilateral lower lobe patchy opacities which may reflect
pulmonary
contusion or underlying aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
4. Subcutaneous emphysema within the superior mediastinum, neck,
and chest
with no large intramuscular hematoma noted.
5. Slight hyperenhancement of the bowel mucosa suggestive of
underlying
hypertension/shock. Multiple scattered mesenteric lymph nodes of
uncertain
significance but presumably reactive.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the Emergency Room by the Trauma
team and bilateral chest tubes were placed.  He was then
emergently taken to the Operating Room for neck exploration &
packing, esophagoscopy and laryngoscopy. His admission
hematocrit was 31 and fell to a low of 22.  He was resuscitated
with multiple units of packed cells and fresh frozen plasma as
he had greater than a liter of blood drain from each chest tube.
Following this initial resuscitation he was taken back to the
Operating Room for reexploration and closure of his wounds. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and remained intubated overnight.
 He was extubated on [**2157-8-5**] but had an episode of desaturation
while turning and was immediately reintubated.  Subsequent
bronchoscopy revealed multiple bilateral airway mucous plugging
and some airway edema.  A BAL showed only minimal GNR's.  He
underwent vigorous pulmonary toilet and was diuresed.  He was
successfully extubated on [**2157-8-8**].

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
good progress.  His hematocrit was stable, his bilateral chest
tubes were removed without difficulty and then his ability to
cough and deep breath improved.  He was gradually able to
tolerate a regular diet and he was seen by both Physical Therapy
and Occupational Therapy to help increase his mobility.  The
Social Worker was involved with both he and his family to help
with coping during this difficult period.  There was also a
question of the patient being sexually assaulted by the intruder
and for that reason was seen by the Center for Violence
Prevention.  He underwent testing for hepatitis and HIV and was
prophylactically placed on anti virils.  He wiil need to follow
up with the Infectious Disease service following discharge for
management of these drugs.  Treatment is anticipated to go over
4 weeks.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] multiple surgical sites were healing well although
his right shoulder wound may need a skin graft in time.  He was
discharged to his former wife's home with VNA follow up for
wound care and general assessment.  He has multiple follow up
appointments in the next few weeks to both keep a close check on
his physical and emotional progress.
