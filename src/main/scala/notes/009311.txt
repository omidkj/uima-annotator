PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs showed her to be afebrile,
respiratory rate of 50, blood pressure 91/27, saturating 97%
on 40% FIO2 while intubated and sedated, with a tidal volume
of 466.  Generally she was sedated and intubated.  HEENT:
Atraumatic, intubated, not responsive while intubated.  Neck:
Supple, no LAD.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no
murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Lungs:  Respiratory crackles at
bases, otherwise clear to auscultation.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, no rebound, no guarding.
Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission the white blood count was 6.1,
hematocrit 33.4, platelet count 150, sodium 141, potassium
4.3, chloride 109, bicarbonate 18, BUN 38, creatinine 1.9, CK
43, CK MB 0, troponin less than .01.  Differential on the WBC
was 76.1 neutrophils, 18.7% lymphocytes, 3.6% monocytes, 1.3%
eos, and 0.3 basophils.

Urinalysis showed specific gravity of 1.020, no blood, no
nitrites, no leukocyte esterase, 30 protein, otherwise
negative.  Urine culture was pending.  Arterial blood gases
were 7.31 pH, 42 CO2, 212 O2, 100% FIO2.

Chest x-ray showed left retrocardiac density, no overt
pulmonary edema, prominence of pulmonary vasculature,
layering of pleural effusion.  An endotracheal tube was
placed to 1?????? cm above the carina.

Electrocardiogram was a rate of 66 and no significant changes
from prior EKG.  There was some T wave flattening in V4, T
wave in V5 and V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Congestive heart failure:  The patient
was admitted for congestive heart failure exacerbation,
intubated, with shortness of breath, and admitted to CCU.
From a coronary standpoint there was no coronary artery
disease status post stenting.  He was continued with aspirin
and Plavix and was cycled for enzymes which were shown to be
negative, ruled out myocardial infarction.

Pump:  She was afterload reduced with captopril.  The
captopril was actually increased while she was in the
hospital daily, and she was given Lasix for diuresis.

She continued on telemetry with no events on telemetry since
admission.

2. Pulmonary:  She did well and was extubated on day two
without any difficulty, did very well and was transferred to
the floor without any difficulty.  She was weaned off of her
O2 and on the day of discharge she was down to two liters,
saturating well in the mid-90s.

3. Renal:  There was no appreciable acute renal failure.
Cardiovascular risk factors was at 1.5 to 1.9.  She remained
close to that, about 2.0.  She was followed daily for her
creatinine given that she was on Lasix.

4. Gastrointestinal:  She was given prophylactic PPI and her
multivitamins.

5. Psychiatry:  Her psychiatric medications were continued
and she was continued on Regular Insulin sliding scale and
good blood sugar control.

6. Prophylaxis:  She was on subcutaneous heparin and PPI for
prophylaxis.

7. Code status:  On the day before discharge per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
her code status after discussing with the family was changed
to DNR/DNI.

The patient was discharged on her home medications with
