History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 yo woman with HTN, DM and HCV cirrhosis admitted
for HRS, on liver and renal [**First Name3 (LF) **] list who is being
transfered to MICU for development of AMS and identification of
embolic strokes on head MRI. The history was obtained from chart
and previous providers. Neurology, [**First Name3 (LF) **] and renal are
following.
She was admitted three weeks ago whith worsening abdominal
ascites and found to have hepatorenal syndrome. She had a
dialysis line placed at the begining of [**Month (only) **] and initiated
dialysis. She She also underwent two paracentesis on [**6-14**] (21
WBCs, 94 RBCs, 15 polys, 36 lymphs; culture negative) and [**6-27**] (
4lts therapeutic only). She has been on cipro ppx but changed to
cefpodoxime for long qt recently. Two days ago she was noted to
be unsteady and complained of dizziness, suffered a reporeted

negative. Subsequently she was noted to have slurred speach,
right eye droop and AMS and Neurology was consulted. Repeat head
CT was negative, but a subsequent MRI was notable for new
embolic appearing stroke. Also of note this morning, after

pressure in the 80s, but this corrected to her baseline of 90s
with 1 LT NS and albumin. In addition she was also noted to have
asterixis and was started on lactulose. She has been afebrile

   54 year old woman with ESLD and acute on chronic renal

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Renal failure worup
Final Report
EXAM: Renal ultrasound obtained [**2121-6-13**].

HISTORY: A 54-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease and
acute on
chronic renal failure.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple static grayscale images through the abdomen
were obtained
and submitted for evaluation.

Findings: Note is made of a significant amount of ascites. The
liver is
shrunken and coarse in echotexture with nodularity, consistent
with the known
history of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.

The right kidney measures 9.6 cm in size. A 2.3 x 2.1 x 2.3 cm
anechoic
structure along the upper pole of the right kidney demonstrates
posterior
enhancement and is most consistent with a simple cyst. There is
no evidence
of hydronephrosis or renal calculi within the right kidney.

The left kidney measures 9.6 cm in size. There is no
hydronep
