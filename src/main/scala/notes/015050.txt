Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-intubation/extubation
-bronchoscopy
-lumbar puncture
-placement/removal of arterial line, PICC line, central venous
line


History of Present Illness:
25 yo gentleman with remote hx brain PNET s/p LS internal shunt
placement for increased ICP in [**2101**], who now presents to the ED
with AMS.  Per the pt's family, the patient had not been feeling
well starting last wed, with complaints c/w URI including cough,
fever, chills, myalgias, lethargy, diarrhea and decreased PO
intake which progressed throughout the week.  They also stated
that he had difficulty navigating around the house which he is
usually able to do despite legal blindness.  Several family
members have been ill with URI symptoms.  He did not feel well
enought for work/usual activities on Tuesday/Wed and therefore
stayed home.  When his parents left on Wed morning, he was
feeling sick and staying in bed, but MS was normal.  When they
returned Wed night, they found him down on the floor of his
room, altered and incontinent of urine and therefore called EMS.
 No seizure activity was observed.  He didrecieve his flu
vaccine this year.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T102.9 P130 BP 111/67 R17-29 O2 sat
93% on 4L. CXR/chest CT performed and was concerning for a
R-sided PNA.  Neurosurgery was consulted out of concern for
infected shunt/meningitis and ceftriaxone, azithro and vanc were
started and he was given tylenol for fever.  After vancomycin
was administered, breathing became more difficult and stridorous
and pt was intubated and treated for anaphylactic reaction with
epipen, solumedrol, famotidine and benadryl.  LP was not done
given pulmonary source was thought to be more likely and pt
would require IR-guided tap given hx of shunt.  CT abd/pelvis
was performed and showed no evidence of infection.  A foley was
placed for a distended bladder and he was started on 5 L NC.  He
was also given 3-4 L IVF.
.
On arrival on the floor he is intubated and sedated, not
responsive to voice.
.

IMAGING:
[**2119-2-15**] CXR: Right middle lobe pneumonia.
.
[**2119-2-15**] CT Head:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Hypodense
areas may relate to prior radiation treatment or
microangiopathic changes. However, MR without and with contrast
can be considered if not contra-indicated for better assessment
of the parenchymal abnormalities and excluding acute conditions
such as infarction.
2. Mildly dilated ventricles- may relate to volume loss.
Attention on close folow up to exclude hydrocephalus given the
h/o Lumbar drain and altered mental status.
3. Diffuse cortical calcification along with basal ganglia and
cerebellar calcifications most likely represents mineralizing
microangiopathy from radiation therapy, or other etiology,
metabolic/infectious etiologies, etc. Correlate clinically.
.
[**2119-2-15**] CT C-Spine: Motion limited study. No gross fracture. If
there is concern for cord, ligamentous or neural injury,
consider MR if not contra-indicated. Thyroid not well seen-
correlate with hormone labs.
.
[**2119-2-16**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Middle lobe consolidation as described.
2. Enlarged fatty liver.
3. Minimal pelvic free fluid which may be related to the shunt.
No localized fluid collection is seen.
.
[**2119-2-16**] CTA Chest:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Severe multifocal pneumonia predominantly in the right middle
lobe, mildly in the right upper lobe and minimally in the right
lower lobe.
3. Subtotal collapse of left lower lobe. Mild atelectasis in the
right lower lobe.
4. Severely and diffusely fatty liver. Bilateral gynecomastia.
