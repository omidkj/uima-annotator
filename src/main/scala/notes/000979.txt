Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, mechanical intubation, continuous
[**Last Name (un) **]-venous hemofiltration

History of Present Illness:
85 year old woman with hx of CAD s/p prior PTCA, pVD, DM2, htn,
chol and anemia presented to NWH on [**2167-4-8**] with unstable
angina. Her EKG was described as unchanged from prior. Her labs
were notable for Trop0.06. BNP 234. creat 1.3 on arrival
(baseline 1.2).
Her evaluation there was notable for cardiac enzymes as above.
She was felt to be in mild congestive heart failure after 1 unit
of pRBCS which she received for a Hct of 26. She received 2
doses of lasix. She was started on a heparin gtt (not listed in
discharge meds. She did have small amount of blood on her toilet
tissue thought secondary to hemorrhoidal bleed. She did receive
a 2nd unit of PRBCs. A TTE (prelim only) LAE, preserved LVEF,
mild MR/TR.
.
She describes her baseline at chronic stable angina with chest
pressure at similar level of exertion such as walking [**5-17**] block
of level ground. However over the past month she noted a
decreased threshhold for her discomfort now after only 1 flight
of stairs. On the day prior to her admission she had the similar
sensation of chest pressure while at rest. It lasted for ~2
hours and improved with nitroglycerin. She had recurrent event
at 1:30pm on the 25th so she presented to the hospital. She
states her weight has been stable. She has chronic venous stasis
and has had new lower extremity swelling over the past few
weeks. She has no orthopnea or PND.

.
On floor, patient was feeling short of breath with walking to
the bathroom but otherwise feeling well. She has no current
chest pain.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools. She has been having small amount of blood on the toilet
tissue over the past few weeks. She denies recent fevers, chills
or rigors. She has exertional leg pain at 4 blocks of walking.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

STUDIES OF RELEVANCE IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER:

[**2167-4-9**] CXR:
Lungs clear, mild pulmonary engorgement and top normal heart
size suggest
borderline cardiac decompensation, but there is no edema or
appreciable
pleural effusion.

[**2167-4-10**] Card Cath:
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had a proximal <50% stenosis.
--the LCX had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the RCA had an ostial >90% stenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated
left-sided
filling pressures, with LVEDP 30 mmHg.  There was mild systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with SBP 149 mmHg.  There was no gradient
across
the aortic valve upon pullback of the angled pigtail catheter
from LV to
ascending aorta.
3.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with two
overlapping
bare metal stents - Minivision (2.5x15mm distally; 2.5x12mm
proximally)
postdilated with a 2.75mm balloon. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III
flow throughout the vesel (See PTCA comments).
4.  Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a 6F
Angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Significant one coronary artery disease.
2.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with two
overlapping
bare metal stents.
3.  Successful clousre of the right femoral arteriotomy site
with a 6F
Angioseal closure device.

[**2167-4-11**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with mild basal and mid-anterior septal
hypokinesis, distal septal akinesis and probable apical
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40-45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericar
dial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal right ventricular systolic function. Mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

[**2167-4-11**]:
IMPRESSION: CT A and P
1. Multifocal consolidations may represent pneumonia, however
pulmonary
hemorrhage in the setting of hyperdense, and likely hemorrhagic,
effusions
should be considered.
2. Retained renal contrast with vicarious excretion via the
gallbladder, all
consistent with renal failure.
3. Fibroid uterus.

[**2167-4-13**] CT Chest:
Followup of a patient with bilateral pleural
effusion, consolidations, and known pneumothorax.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen from [**2167-4-11**] and multiple chest
radiographs
obtained in the interval be
