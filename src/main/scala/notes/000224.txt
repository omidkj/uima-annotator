DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Bacteremia/hypotension.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension/bacteremia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Sixty-year old female with
history of CAD status post CABG, end-stage CHF on chronic
dopamine, status post biventricular pacer with an EF of 20%,
a transthoracic echocardiogram on [**11/2127**] and diabetes
mellitus.  Recently admitted on [**7-2**] to [**7-3**] for
bacteremia, coag-negative Staph, plus Stenotrophomonas, who
presents complaining of diarrhea x2 days, also with positive
fevers up to about 102.  Pertinent details of her previous
hospitalization include a similar presentation with diarrhea
and fevers.  The decision was made with ID to not to treat
her systematically and to leave her Hickman line intact.
She was then discharged on antibiotics.

Husband noted that patient was weak and unable to get out of
bed this morning and was lightheaded.  Had diarrhea with mild
abdominal cramping, no nausea, no vomiting, nonbloody.  No
change in diet.  No sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] chest pain, shortness
of breath, or dysuria.  States that she has occasional calf
pain with no swelling.  On arrival to ED, noted to be
hypotensive with blood pressures of 40s/20s.  Normally she
runs 60s-80s/30s-50s.  Noninvasive cuff correlates with
manual readings.  Her dopamine was increased to 20 and was
given IV fluid bolus 500 cc x1.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) 13588**].

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 101, her T max and her T
current was 99.7 on admission.  Her blood pressure was 63/33
on admission to CCU.  Her pulse was 80.  Respiratory 18.  She
was sating 96% on 2 liters, later on 91% on room air.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Generally:  She was awake,
diaphoretic, sleepy, but easily arousable and verbally
responsive.  HEENT:  PERRLA and extraocular motor is intact.
Moist membrane mucosa.  Neck was supple.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Cardiovascular:  She had a metallic sound, more of a systolic
murmur best heard on her apex.  Otherwise, regular, rate, and
rhythm.  Abdomen:  Bowel sounds were present, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Cool extremities,
unable to palpate dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurologic is oriented x3.  Strength is [**3-22**] throughout, no
focal deficits.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cells 3.0, hematocrit
29.3, platelets 150.  Sodium 131, potassium 5.3, chloride 96,
bicarb 20, BUN 71, creatinine 2.9, and glucose 80.  Albumin
3.7, calcium 8.7, magnesium 1.8, phosphorus 5.3, INR 4.0, and
PTT of 39.1.  ALT of 77, LDH 27, alkaline phosphatase 189,
AST 71.  CK 318.  Total bilirubin 1.6, and lipase 27.

EKG was AV sequentially paced, left bundle branch block, rate
81, normal QRS axis, no ST-T wave changes.

Chest x-ray:  No acute redistribution of flow. Enlarged heart.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  For CAD, no acute issues at this point.
She is continued on her aspirin and statin since she was
admitted.  Her beta blockers and ACE initially were held in
the setting of low blood pressures.

For her pump, well compensated and likely hypovolemic.  She
was challenged with IV fluid boluses 250 cc each time and the
Bumex and Lasix were held at that time initially, and
continued with the aldactone for now.

For hypotension, she was kept on dopamine.  Dopamine drips
were increased with a titration goal given a systolic blood
pressures of greater than 60 with IV boluses and dopamine
drip.  Her picture was most likely a mix between a
cardiogenic component and a distributive secondary to sepsis.

Rhythm:  She was placed on telemetry, and was paced, and she
was biventricularly paced, but no right bundle branch block,
questionable though.

She had an acute renal failure on top of her chronic renal
insufficiency likely related to her hypovolemia which had
resolved upon her discharge and possibly secondary to her
diarrhea in setting of chronic requirement for diuretics.

Her fevers were likely secondary to infection of the Hickman
based on previous admission.  We are awaiting culture data.
There was much discussion of her Hickman line previous
admission.  We will need to clarify at time with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for possible plans for her central access.  On admission, she
was started on empirical Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl
to cover the GI scan and Clostridium difficile, and she was
added for stool studies.  Her Coumadin was held at the time
because she was supertherapeutic, INR of 4.0.  Her goal INR
is 2.5.  On her discharge, according to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her goal
INR has changed, now between 2-2.5 given that she has a
valve.

For diabetes, she was put on regular insulin-sliding scale.
She tolerated that well and sugars within acceptable goals.

Prophylactically, she was ambulating later on day two of
hospitalization.  For her cardiovascular, we will still
continue with her aspirin and statin.  We are still holding
the beta blockers until volume status stabilizes.  Considering
restarting beta blocker as she can tolerate her blood
pressure.

In terms of her ID status, she was continued on her
Vancomycin, levofloxacin, Flagyl, and Zosyn for broad
coverage, and ID was consulted for further input.  ID was
then consulted.  ID recommended to discontinue Zosyn,
discontinue Vancomycin, and discontinue Flagyl, to continue
levofloxacin and to change the dose to 250 q.24h., also check
the stool for Clostridium difficile.  They also recommended
repeat blood cultures x2 and labeled the site of the
specimens, which was done when she was admitted.  They also
said that if blood cultures from [**8-6**] show Stenotrophomonas,
would consider transesophageal echocardiogram, and would
consider removing her Hickman catheter. It is recognized that
access for Hickman is formidable issue, requiring prior
replacement in operating room.

On [**8-8**], her levofloxacin was increased from
250 to 500 given that 2/3 bottles from [**8-6**] grew
gram-negative rods.  She remained afebrile meanwhile and
lungs were clear.  Her blood pressures with dopamine drip was
much improved by [**8-8**], and she was back to her home IV
dose of 8 mcg/kg/minute, which she continued to be on that
dose until discharge date.

On [**8-9**], ID suggested to continue levofloxacin, and also
because the blood cultures also grew budding yeast.  They also
recommended to start fluconazole at which point, she was
started on fluconazole 400 mg IV q.24h. with close [**Month/Year (2) 7941**]
of INR because of the interaction of fluconazole with
Coumadin.  Though her blood cultures from the previous
gram-negative rods actually grew Klebsiella, she was
continued on levofloxacin to cover the Klebsiella, which was
sensitive to levofloxacin.

Surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **]. The  Cardiology service,
and Medicine service, and Infectious Disease service, they
all agree that the Hickman line should be removed and replaced
if feasible.  Balancing risk/benefit, surgery disagreed and
wanted the Hickman line in thinking that
since the patient has been asymptomatic and afebrile, and
because of the need for dopamine drip and the need for central
acc
