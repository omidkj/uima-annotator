Allergies:
Percocet / Percodan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Contained rupture of an  infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, repair of ventral
hernia.

1.Placement of open tracheostomy 2.therapaeutic bronchoscopy 3.
esophageoscopy


History of Present Illness:
This is an 83-year-old woman who presented emergently to [**Hospital 29158**] Hospital with abdominal and back pain and tenderness who
was noted on CT to have a likely
contained rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where contrast CT was performed, again
showing likely contained rupture of an  infrarenal abdominal
aortic aneurysm. She was not a candidate for an Endograft
repair due to severe angulation of the proximal neck, inadequate
neck below the renal arteries and very small iliac arteries. She
was taken emergently to the operating room for aneurysm repair

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR. LV inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes. Suboptimal image quality -
ventilator.

Conclusions

There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Cannot exclude basal
inferior hypokinesis; image quality technically suboptimal for
assessment of regional wall motion. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion


Brief Hospital Course:

Emergent AAA repair - intra op recieved PRBC / PLT / FFP / Fluid
resusitation

Sent to the CVICU in critical condition

Presuure support and resusitation while in the CVICU

While in the CVICU multiple atempts to wean patient. Could not
Thoracics consulted. Trach and peg placed.

Pt also experienced in crease in WBC / febrile / All lines
changed out. Pan cx'd. Pos urine and sputum. Pan sensitive to
cipro.  Sputum - E Coli treated with cipro, urine - Morganelli
also sensitive Cipro. Pt to be on Cipor for 14 days upon DC.

Pt also had agitatiion. Haldol given with good results

Pt also had elevation in cardiac enzymes. Cardiology consult -
demand ischemia, cardiology followed. On Enzymes are decreasing.
Pt needs full Cardiac work-up as an out patient.

Once completely resusitated from CVICU. Pt sent to the VICU for
further care. PT consult and Case Management involed
