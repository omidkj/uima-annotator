Radiology
.
CXR [**2148-9-1**]:
1. Interval increase in size of right pleural effusion, which is
now large, with adjacent right basilar atelectasis.
2. Left basilar opacity, which could represent an infection,
atelectasis, or aspiration.
.
CXR [**2148-9-2**]
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2148-9-1**].

There is significant interval decrease in the right pleural
effusion with no
definite evidence of pneumothorax. Multiple left rib fractures
are
redemonstrated. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
.
CT CHEST [**2148-9-2**]:
1. New large right pleural effusion since [**2148-7-8**] on a
background of subacute
healing right comminuted rib fractures.

2. Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.

3. Healed left rib fractures with associated pleural thickening.


4. Mixed solid and ground-glass left lower lobe nodule,
concerning for
bronchoalveolar carcinoma with a central adenocarcinoma, stable
since [**2148-7-8**]
but enlarged since [**2147-3-9**].
.
Renal U/S [**2148-9-5**]
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.7 cm and the left kidney
measures 11.1
cm. There is no hydronephrosis and no stone or solid mass is
seen in either
kidney. Multiple simple cysts are identified bilaterally. One
contains thin
septations within the right kidney, however, this cyst
demonstrates no
vascularity within these septations. The largest cyst in the
right kidney
measures 9.2 x 7.5 x 7.7 cm and
