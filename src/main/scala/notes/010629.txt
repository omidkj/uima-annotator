Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral line placement

History of Present Illness:
76 year old gentleman with trachestomy/PEG, bronchopleural
fistula, CHF, CVA who was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] MICU 4
days ago to [**Hospital **] rehab after prolonged hospitalization for
cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury and status epilepticus.
The injury to his brain was apparently severe and his prognosis
on discharge on [**5-23**] was very poor. At rehab on [**5-26**], patient
found unresponsive in pulseless electrical activity, CPR
performed, pt placed back on ventilation with return of pulse.
Mental status reportedly worsened, however, and pt is
unresponsive with decorticate posturing.
IN [**Name (NI) **] pt received vancomycin, levofloxacin and flagyl. L SC line
attempted but was removed as coiled upward; subsequent R femoral
line placed.


Past Medical History:
1) prior cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury
2) Bronchopleural fistula with MRSA, chest tube in place
3) Chronic respiratory failure, with tracheostomy/PEG
4) Ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 15%

[**2141-5-28**] BILAT UPPER EXT U/S:
Limited study. The left basilic vein is not visualized. It is
uncertain if this represents a remote history of occlusion. The
remaining of the study demonstrates no evidence of DVT.

1. No acute intra-abdominal pathology.
2. Persistent right basilar hydropneumothorax (with chest tube)
with decreased atelectasis or consolidation adjacent to it.

5. Overall decrease in abdominal ascites with persistent
anasarca of the soft tissues.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 M admitted s/p PEA arrest, h/o prior arrest with anoxic brain
injury, trach/PEG for resp failure, bronchopleural fistula with
chest tube, CHF with EF 15%, CVA with seizure disorder, s/p
treatment for MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia, and VRE UTI.

1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt likely suffered PEA arrest due to
hypoxic resp failure secondary to ESBL Klebsiella pneumonia.  On
admission to MICU, pt was intubated and placed on PSV.  He was
treated with vancomycin/meropenem for h/o MRSA and ESBL
klebsiella identified on sputum cx, and switched to
linezolid/meropenem for new onset VRE from urine cx.  He
remained hemodynamically stable in the ICU, and PSV was
progressively weaned over several days.  On [**2141-5-31**], he
successfully underwent a spontaneous breathing trial, and was
switched to a trach mask.  His chest tube demonstrated
persistent air leaks likely from his bronchopleural fistula.  It
was placed on a clamp trial on [**2141-5-31**], but pt showed increased
work on breathing and became tachycardic within 30min.  The
chest tube was unclamped and left on water seal for the
remainder of his MICU course, which the patient tolerated well.


Of note the [**5-31**] pleural fluids had rare gram negative rods, his
chest tube is draining to a 'pneumostat seal', interventional
pulmonary was notified and will follow him to manage the chest
tube.   Chest x-rays should be repeated every few days to see if
the broncopleural fistula has healed, and that point
consideration will be given toward discontinuing the chest tube;
in the interval; linezolid and meropenem should be continued for
a total of 6 weeks.
.
2) FEVER/LEUKOCYTOSIS: On [**2141-5-27**], pt became febrile up to 102,
with WBC to 12, and was hypotensive to SBP 90s.  His BP
responded quickly to fluids, not requiring pressors.  Sputum cx
demonstrated ESBL Klebsiella and urine cx showed VRE.  He was
switched from vancomycin/meropenem to linezolid/meropenem for
treatment of his pneumonia and UTI.  His R femoral line was also
removed for concerns of a line infxn, though blood and cath tip
cultures remained negative at time of discharge.  Both his
leukocytosis and fever resolved within 24hrs, and he remained
afebrile for the duration of his hospital course.
.
3) ANEMIA: At initial presentation, pt's hct trended down
slowly, requiring transfusions with 3u pRBCs over 3 days.  Small
amounts of blood was initially noted draining from his chest
tube and PEG tube, and stool was guaiac+.  CT abdomen and pelvis
revealed no intraabdominal pathology.  Later, frank bleeding was
noted from the underside of his tongue, likely a laceration
secondary to tongue biting.  ENT was consulted and the site was
cauterized with silver nitrate and packed with gauze with good
effect.  Pt's hct stabilized after cauterization.  Aspirin and
heparin SC were held but restarted on discharge.
.
4) CHF ischemic with systolic dysfunction (EF 15%): Given his
hypotensive episode on [**2141-5-27**], his home blood pressure
medications were held.  Lasix was periodically given for gentle
diuresis.  Diuretics remain held given that his creatinine would
rise with attempts at diuresis.
He came in on 100 IV lasix with 100 IV chlorthalidone TID, he
may need to restart this should he oxygenation deteriorate.  The
pt has anasarca.  Diuresis will need to be restarted with
caution with his low nl blood pressure and known infections.
-aspirin restared on discharge, consider restarting metoprolol
12.5 TID if blood pressure tolerates.  Goal SBP in 90-100 range.
.
5) CRI: Pt's creatinine was near baseline for most of his MICU
stay.  It did tend Medications were renally dosed as necessary.
.
6) F/E/N: Pt was maintained on tube feeds with protein supp
.
7) PPx: IV PPIs, pneumoboots, hep SCbowel regimen
.
8) Access: L arm PICC placed on [**6-4**]
.
9) Code: Despite h/o anoxic brain injury and pt in a persistent
vegetative state, pt remains full
