asymptomatic at that time without CP/SOB, lightheadedness or

Imaging:
[**2195-4-14**] LENI- IMPRESSION:  Limited examination due to patient
discomfort and extensive subcutaneous edema with no evidence of
deep venous thrombosis in the left common femoral, superficial
femoral, or popliteal veins.

[**2195-4-14**] CXR- Severe cardiomegaly has worsened, but pulmonary
edema has cleared.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  Right
supraclavicular dual-channel [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] catheter ends in the
region of the superior cavoatrial junction, unchanged.
Transvenous right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer
defibrillator leads are in standard placements.  No pneumothorax
or appreciable pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71F with history of CHF, CAD, afib on coumadin, ESRD on HD and
COPD presenting with LLE cellulitis.
.
# Cellulitis - patient with chronic ulcers on left lower
extremity presented with inreased pain and erythema and elevated
WBC consistent with cellulitis.  She was recently treated for
cellulitis in that leg with vancomycin on previous
hospitalization in [**2194-1-28**]. After two days of vancomycin, she
had marked improvement in the leg with decreased erythema in
color and was dramatically receeding from the marked border
below the area. There was still [**12-1**]+pitting edema in the left
thigh, but improved compared to admission when it was harder and
was obscuring the anatomical markings of the knee on extension.
LENI of the leg was negative for DVT.  She was seen by vascular
surgery during this admission, who did not feel that surgery was
indicated and agreed with the proposed medical management.
-Vancomycin dosed with HD x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
-Ciprofloxacin 500mg po qday x 2 weeks (last day [**4-28**])
.
#Hypotension - patient hypotensive to SBPs in 80s. In the ED
there was concern that she was possibly septic, so she was
admited to the ICU. She received 1.5L of IV fluids and her BP
repsonded well. Her baseline blood pressure is in the low 90s
systolic.  After being on the floor she continued to have lower
blood pressures and was asymptomatic with them.
-She will require monitoring of her blood pressure during
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**] sessions
.
# Afib - on amiodarone and coumadin as outpatient.  Stable.  INR
therapeutic at 2.1 on admission.  Continued on home medications
- cont warfarin and amiodarone
.
# CAD - Continued on amiodarone, pravastatin and SLNGT
.
# COPD - on spiriva, alubterol and fluticasone at home. Also
uses 2L NC at night at home. Has had cough for the past [**3-6**]
weeks and recently started on doxycycline on [**4-10**], which was
continued for planned 7 day course total and will be completed
on [**4-16**].  No worsening SOB.  CXR showed no evidence of PNA
.
# chronic sytolic CHF - Continued on home furosemide dose.
Patinet is not on ACEI prior to this admission, and this was not
started given her hypotension.
.
# ESRD - Continued on HD schedule of T-TH-SAT. She received an
extra ultrafiltration session on [**4-17**] (friday) to try to remove
more fluid from her left leg.
.
Transitional Issues:
Pending labs/studies: Blood cultures from [**2195-4-14**]
Medications started:
1. Vancomycin (antibiotic) to be given with [**Month/Day/Year 2286**] through
[**4-28**]. Cipro
