Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, syncope

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 53899**] is a 65 year old female, with history of CAD s/p
NSTEMI [**2108**], STEMI [**9-16**] with proximal LAD occlusion treated with
BMS, systolic heart failure with EF 25%, LV hypertrophy and
hypertension, current LLE DVT and multiple pulmonary emboli.
The patient had a recent admission for multiple syncopal
episodes when she was found to be in cardiogenic/septic shock
with Strep pneumo pneumonia with admission complicated by PE,
DVT and right-sided penumothorax, and was discharged to [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab MACU yesterday evening with plan to return [**2113-10-17**] for
ICD placement. Today, patient became unresponsive and unable to
follow commands.  Per report from EMS, she was hypoxic to the
60%s.

ED course: 97.6 92 105/73 20 99%RA.  EKG showed NSR at 90 bpm
with Q waves in V1-V3, slight ST elevations in V3-V4 and
prolonged QT, which were all unchanged from before.  Labs
notable for BNP 2398, K 3.1 and WBC 12.2 with 82% PMNs.
Troponin was 0.01 and lactate 1.7.  Blood cultures were drawn.
Given cefepime and vancomycin.

EKG in the ED showed NSR at 90 bpm with Q waves in V1-V3. CT
head did not demonstrate any evidence of intracranial
lesions/hemorrhage/masses, but there is sinus opacification.
- Chest x-ray shows mild-mod pneumothorax at the right base,
?small PTX at apex too. Patient had a chest tube in which was
discontinued yesterday without any post x-ray.  RIJ terminating
in mid-SVC
- CT w/ & w/o contrast: 1. Moderate right basal pneumothorax,
increased since the prior study; 2. No interval increase in
Bilateral pulmonary embolism in the LLL, RUL. No right heart
strain; 3. Bibasal consolidations, atelectasis/infection.
- Central line [**10-11**] still in place
- Bedside cardiac ultrasound shows poor ejection fraction, no
pericardial effusion no obvious right-sided heart strain
- CTA: 1. Moderate right basal pneumothorax, increased since the
prior study. 2. No interval increase in Bilateral pulmonary
embolism in the LLL, RUL. No right heart strain. 3. Bibasal
consolidations, atelectasis/infection.

On admission to the CCU, she is afebrile, 93% on 2L NC, with no
specific complaints. She remembers being SOB earlier today, and
says this has now resolved. She does not remember further
details and does not remember syncopizing. She denies any
current SOB, cough, chest pain, palpitations, LH, dizziness. She
has not had a BM in 2 days. No dysuria, urgency, or frequency.

IMAGING
[**2113-10-17**] TTE:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined.
Microbubles are seen in the left atrium. This could represent a
right to left shunt through the inter atrial septum. A complete
transthoracic echo looking for right-to-left shunt is
recommended.
IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Tricuspid regurgitation.

[**2113-10-14**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY:
1. No significant interval change in the bilateral pulmonary
emboli involving the lobar and segmental branches of the right
upper lobe and left lower lobe.  No evidence of right heart
strain.
2. Possible developing infarction in the left lower lobe
(superior segment).  Bibasilar consolidations, due to aspiration
are similar.
3. Interval increase in the moderate right pneumothorax.

[**2113-10-14**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
re is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
masses or mass effect. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. The ventricles and sulci are mildly dilated,
consistent with involutional changes. The basal cisterns are
normal. Calcifications are seen in bilateral vertebral arteries
and cavernous internal carotid arteries. There is near-complete
opacification of the left maxillary sinus, and partial
opacification of
bilateral ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. The mastoid air cells
are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality. Extensive
pansinus disease.

CXR: [**2113-10-20**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, the right-sided chest
tube
has been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other
complication. A minimal right pleural effusion with a small
right basal atelectasis persists.  Unchanged mild to mode
