Service:  ACOVE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old male with a
past medical history significant for throat cancer, status post
surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy with a history of
minor aspiration events, who presented to an outside hospital on
[**2101-5-29**], status post a mild choking episode while eating while
in [**State 48158**] with cough, hypoxia, shortness of breath.  He was
found to have a severe right sided infiltrate on chest x-ray.  He
was ruled out for tuberculosis.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] ICU on [**2101-6-3**], and intubated
for hypoxic respiratory failure.  Originally, he was on
Levofloxacin and Clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia.  He had
persistent fevers in the ICU.  Because of his significant travel
history, serologies for coccidioides and strongyloides were sent.
He also received Vancomycin for a seven day course.  There was a
question of possible drug fever because of persistent fever and
persistent elevated peripheral eosinophils.  Clindamycin was
discontinued and he was on Levofloxacin and Flagyl upon transfer
to the floor.  Malaria workup was negative.  His arterial line
grew coagulase negative Staphylococcus and the line was
discontinued.  However, since transfer out of the unit, he has
been afebrile for a total of two days.  He was extubated on
[**2101-6-13**], with a slow wean likely secondary to his severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  He failed video swallow study on
[**2101-6-13**], and since then has been NPO with a nasogastric tube in
place.  He was called out to the ACOVE service and currently was
without any complaints.  He denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
change in stool.  He wanted to ambulate.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his girlfriend,
[**Name (NI) **] in [**Location (un) **], [**State 350**].  She is also his health
care proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] was a former smoker and denies current
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.9, heart rate 83 to
100, blood pressure 107 to 125 over 54 to 60, respiratory
rate 17 to 23, oxygen saturation 93 to 97% on four to five
liters oxygen via nasal cannula. In general, the patient is
alert, oriented times three in chair.  Head, eyes, ears, nose
and throat - normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  OG tube in place.  Neck -
2+ carotids, supple, no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular is
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Respiratory - crackles at the right base greater than the
left base, some bronchial breath sounds on the right upper
border.  The abdomen is normoactive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing
or edema.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII are
intact with 5/5 strength in the lower extremities and upper
extremities bilaterally.  Nonfocal examination.

LABORATORY DATA:  Upon transfer to Acove, white blood cell
count had come down to 17.8, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count
1091.  Chem10 was unremarkable. ALT 42, AST 28, alkaline
phosphatase 160, total bilirubin 0.3.  Differential
significant for 57% polys, 2 bands, 4 lymphocytes, 7
monocytes, 28 eosinophils, and 2 basophils.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 61 year old admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
Intensive Care Unit from [**Hospital 48159**] Hospital for hypoxic
respiratory failure and severe right sided pneumonia.  Past
medical history is significant for throat cancer, status post
resection/reconstructive surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy
in remission, history of minor aspirations, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, sciatica, malaria which recurs annually
(former Green Beret).  He was intubated shortly after his
admission here and his chest x-ray was significant for infiltrate
throughout the right lung.  On transfer to the floor, his severe
aspiration pneumonia was improving both clinically and
radiographically.  He was doing well on Levaquin and Flagyl.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Aspiration pneumonia - This was thought to be secondary to
aspiration, however, given his travel history, he was worked up
for coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis.  At the time of this
dictation, these serologies are still pending. He was intubated
on [**2101-6-3**], upon admission and extubated on [**2101-6-12**], with a
slow wean from the ventilator secondary to his severe underlying
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Radiographically,
infiltrates have improved though a couple of areas on the CAT
scan appear to be possibly evolving abscesses.  Antibiotics were
changed around though he was finally placed on Levofloxacin and
Flagyl.  His course in the ICU was complicated by recurrent
fevers of unclear etiology. Drug reaction was considered given
the peripheral eosinophilia and malaria was also considered but
parasite smear was negative.  The A line which grew out coagulase
negative Staphylococcus was pulled.  While on the floor, he
was continued on Levaquin and Flagyl.  His white blood cell
count continued to trend down.  He remained afebrile and he
was using an incentive spirometer at the bedside.  He
remained NPO with an OG tube for medications with a plan to
be reevaluated by speech and swallow service on Friday, [**2101-6-17**].
His reevaluation did demonstrate some improvement from the
initial study of [**2101-6-13**].  The patient continues to present with
severe to profound pharyngeal dysphagia. ENT was consulted and
they recommended as well to either place a percutaneous
endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding and that he was at severe
risk for aspiration, to NPO.  They recommended a CT scan of the
oral cavity and neck with contrast to rule out tumor recurrence
which was done and revealed no new mass.  They also recommended
an outpatient barium swallow to rule out esophageal mass or
obstruction.  He will need to follow-up with his ENT as an
outpatient for this.  At this point, the conversation about
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement was brought up
with he patient and his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **] was reluctant to have a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed since he had
already experienced this in the past, however, since it was
unsafe for him to take any food by mouth, he agreed to go ahead
with a temporary percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
placement.  The procedure is planned for [**2101-6-20**].  For his
pneumonia, he will continue on Levofloxacin and Flagyl to
complete a four week course, i.e., [**2101-7-7**].  Infectious disease
service was also following the patient and they will be following
up on the serologies that are still pending.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - He was continued
on Flovent, Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers.

3.  Eosinophilia - The patient was noted to have rising
peripheral eosinophils up to the low 30s on [**2101-6-12**].  At around
that time, he also developed maculopapular rash consistent with a
drug reaction only on his abdomen. However, this resolved in a
few days.  The etiology of the eosinophils was unclear.  The
differential diagnosis included a drug reaction, ho
