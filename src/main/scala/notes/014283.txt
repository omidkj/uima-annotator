Admission Date:  [**2179-11-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2179-11-29**]


Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery Service

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  This is an 82-year-old woman who has
had a history of atrial fibrillation for the past 20 years.

In [**2178-6-26**], she was admitted to [**Hospital1 190**] with congestive heart failure.  A cardiac
catheterization was performed at that time which revealed 2
to 3+ mitral regurgitation with a small atrial septal defect,
as well as no flow-limiting coronary artery disease.

Since that admission, she has done well symptomatically until
recently when she was admitted to [**Hospital3 24768**] again
with congestive heart failure and lower extremity edema.  She
diuresed her while she was there, and then she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**2179-11-16**]; at which
time the ejection fraction was noted to be 55%.  The left
atrium was markedly dilated with a left-to-right shunt noted
across the intra-atrial septum.  A secundum atrial septal
defect was also present.  There was 3+ mitral regurgitation,
1+ aortic insufficiency, and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation at
that time.

She was discharged home, taken off of her Coumadin, and had
been managed with Lovenox, and she was to be admitted with
her date of admission on [**2179-11-22**] for a repeat
cardiac catheterization with mitral valve surgery to follow
the next day.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (This is an 82-year-old woman with a
past medical history significant for)
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Mitral regurgitation.
3.  Atrioseptal defect.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has a remote
history of cigarette smoking (quitting 20 years ago).

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Past surgical history is significant
for lens implants.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had drug allergies to ACCUPRIL and an
ANGIOTENSIN MEDICATION (the exact medication unknown).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (The patient's medications on
admission were)
1.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.
3.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Isordil 10 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Lovenox 60 mg p.o. b.i.d. (the last dose given on [**2179-11-21**]).

HOSPITAL COURSE:   She underwent a mitral valve replacement
with a 31-mm [**Company 1543**] mosaic porcine valve as well as left
atrial atherectomy and atrial septal defect closure with
left-sided maze procedure on [**2179-11-23**].  The total
cardiopulmonary bypass time for this procedure was 124
minutes, and the total cross-clamp time was 92 minutes.

The patient was transferred in stable condition, being
arteriovenous paced at 80 beats per minute, to the Cardiac
Surgery Recovery Unit on Neo-Synephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg per
minute and propofol at 25 mcg/kg per minute.

On postoperative day one, the patient was extubated at
approximately 5 o'clock in the morning without complications.
The patient was afebrile, being arteriovenous paced at 80
beats per minute.  The patient's white blood cell count of
18.4, hematocrit was 30.6, and platelet count was 153.
Otherwise, electrolytes were stable.

On postoperative day two, the patient remained afebrile.  Her
vital signs were stable, and a junctional rhythm at 68,
saturating at 94% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  White blood
cell count was down to 18.1, hematocrit was down to 26.4, and
the platelet count was 138.  Electrolytes were normal.
Physical examination was unremarkable with a plan to begin
Lasix and to transfer to the floor.

Cardiology/Electrophysiology Service was consulted for the
patient's persistent atrial fibrillation at which time they
recommended to continue with beta blocker for now and
Coumadin with an INR goal of 2 to 3.  They also stated that
they would discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding
antiarrhythmic therapy, future cardioversion, and possible
future electrophysiology procedures.

On postoperative day three, the patient was afebrile.  Heart
rate was 68.  In atrial fibrillation.  Otherwise, vital signs
were stable.  White blood cell count was 18.1.  The plan was
to consult with Cardiology regarding Coumadin and amiodarone
use.  Cardiology consulted with the patient again at that
time; at which time they suggested intravenous heparin until
her INR was greater than 2 with a goal of 2 to 3, to utilize
a low-dose Lopressor for high heart rates (for example,
greater than 80 to 90), and to maintain it for 24 hours if
the beta blocker was started for bradycardia, and if the
patient required beta blocker and became bradycardic the
patient may need a pacemaker.  They also recommended to
follow up with a private cardiologist after the patient was
discharged.

On postoperative day four, the patient was still afebrile.
In atrial fibrillation at 77 beats per minute.  Otherwise,
physical examination was unremarkable.  The plan was to
discharge the patient when her INR was greater than 2, and to
administer 5 mg of Coumadin today and then 2.5 mg of
Coumadin.  INR at that time was 1.6.

On postoperative day five, the patient was still afebrile.
In a normal sinus rhythm at 71 beats per minute.  The patient
received a total of 7.5 mg of Coumadin the night prior, and
the plan was to continue to monitor the patient's INR with a
plan for discharge when INR was greater than 2.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged on
postoperative day six (which was [**2179-11-29**]) in stable
condition.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Physical examination upon
discharge was unremarkable.  The patient was in sinus rhythm
at 73 beats per minute and afebrile.  INR was 2.4.  White
blood cell count was 15, and hematocrit was 25.2, and a
platelet count of 142.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient was discharged on the
following medications)
1.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.d. (with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3).
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Sarna lotion (for her skin rash).
5.  Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4h. as needed (for
pain).
