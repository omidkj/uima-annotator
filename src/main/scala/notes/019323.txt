Reason: Please place PTC and stent
IMPRESSION: Cholangiogram demonstrates moderate dilation of the
intrahepatic biliary ducts as well as partial obstruction at the
level of the confluence of an anomalous right bile duct and the
right and left hepatic ducts. The exact appearance of the
obstuction may be better delineated by pull- back
cholangiography after the ducts have decompressed in [**1-18**] days.
Successful placement of an 8-French internal-external biliary
drain through an anomalous right biliary duct.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2128-3-10**] 9:03 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogeneous pancreatic mass extending into the root of the
mesentery as above, compatible with recurrent pancreatic
adenocarcinoma.
2. Ascites, prominent enhancing mesenteric lymph nodes as above.
3. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions with associated airspace
disease, likely reflecting atelectasis.
.
IR Biliary Drain [**2128-3-12**]
Biliary obstruction appears to be secondary to narrowed, encased
Roux loop, which we were unable to cross distally to stent.
Successful placement of 8 Fr left internal-external biliary
drain with the tip positioned within the Roux loop, connected to
a bag for external drainage. This should decompress the left and
right bile ducts as well as the obstructed roux loop.
The previously placed biliary drain through the right anomalous
biliary duct was removed and the tract was embolized with
Gelfoam.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 65 year old female with recurrence of pancreatic tumor
who presented with abdominal and back pain and obstructive
jaundice.
ERCP was unsuccessful in cannulating her duct to relieve the
obstruction.
She went to IR for a PTC and had dilated intrahepatic ducts, and
successful placement of an 8-Fr internal-external biliary drain
through an anomalous R biliary duct.
A CT showed recurrent pancreatic cancer.
She then went to IR for stent placement on [**3-12**]. However, the
biliary obstruction appears to be secondary to narrowed, encased
Roux loop, which we were unable to cross distally to stent.
Successful placement of 8 Fr left internal-external biliary
drain with the tip positioned within the Roux loop, connected to
a bag for external drainage. This should decompress the left and
right bile ducts as well as the obstructed roux loop.
The previously placed biliary drain through the right anomalous
biliary duct was removed and the tract was embolized with
Gelfoam.

Chronic Pain was consulted for a Celiac Plexus Block. she went
for this procedure on [**2128-3-15**] and had some expectant relief.

She developed clear evidence of precipitace recurrent disease.
She has a large [**Location (un) 21851**] at the root of the root of the
mesentery on CT scan. It is
obstructing her full pancreaticobiliary efferent limb rendering
her jaundice and bilirubin rising each day. She has a mild
septic picture and now comes to the operating room on [**2128-3-17**] for
an attempt to decompress this obstructive pancreaticobiliary
rim. This is a last ditch effort change in the patient but
clear aggressive recurrent pancreatic cancer with a hope at
palliation.
Upon opening she had ischemic infarcted small bowel.

Her family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and her abdomen was closed. She was
made CMO and passed away early the next morning.
