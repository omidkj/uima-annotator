Chief Complaint:
Syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female with HTN, CAD s/p CABG presents with nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea since this morning.

Patient was in her usual state of health until this morning when
she awoke with nausea, bilious vomiting and diarrhea.  No blood
loss reported.  She was help to the toilet and then had the
first of two witnessed syncopal events (witnessed by caretaker).
 EMS was called.  She had another episode in front of EMS who
found her to be pale and hypotensive.  Each episode is reported
as less than 1 minute long with no seizure activity.  She was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, she was found to be hypotensive to SBP in the 70s and
bradycardic to the 50s.  EKG showed RBBB with no ST changes.  On
exam, she was tender to palpation on abdominal exam.  CT scan
showed sigmoid thickening to descending colon consistent with
ischemic vs infectious colitis.  Surgical team was consulted but
after discussion between PCP and family, it was decided that
surgery would not be pursued.

She received 3L NS and had a right IJ placed.  Started on
levophed with improved in SBP to 110s.  Mental status also
improved.  She had more bilious emesis in the ED.  NG tube was
placed with 600cc of bilious emesis returned.  No further
episodes of diarrhea occured in the ED.  Of note, she had
isolated oral temp of 92.0.  Rectal probe placed with repeat
temp of 35.4.  CVP was 7.  Foley was in place and patient had
good UOP.  She was started on cipro/flagyl in the ED.

Goals of care discussion with famiy; she is DNR/DNI, but
pressors are okay to use.  No compressions.

On transfer to the floor, patient was afebrile with HR- 74, BP-
161/68, RR- 20, SaO2- 99% on 2L NC.

On the floor, patient was feeling better.  SBP was in the 160s
and patient's HR was in the 80s.  She continued to have
abdominal pain but mental status had improved.

Pertinent Results:
HCT: 37 --> 27
WBC: 3.2 --> 28 --> 14

Cr: 1.3
Bicarb: 30 --> 18

LFTs normal

Troponin negative x3

TSH: 10 (recommend outpt follow up, recheck when pt not ill)

Lactate: 2.5 --> 1.9 --> 0.8

Urine culture:  MSSA

CTA ABD/PELVIS:
1. No definite signs of vascular occlusion though segments of
bowel wall
thickening in the distal descending and sigmoid colon raises
concern for
ischemic bowel versus infectious colitis. No free air or
evidence of
perforation. Abdominal ascites noted.
2. Small right pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, with evidence of
CHF.
3. Interstitial lung disease notable at the lung bases.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
5. NGT tip in distal esophagus. Recommend advancement.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female with CAD s/p CABG, HTN admitted with syncope x2,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and hypotension. Found to have bowel
wall thickening, concerning for ischemic colitis vs ischemic
colitis. Also found to have MSSA UTI. Clinically improved.
.
.
# Sepsis / Septic shock / MSSA UTI (blood cultures negative).
The patient was initially admitted with hypotension and concern
for sepsis. Her hypotension resolved with fluid resuscitation.
She was briefly on pressure support medications but was weaned
from these upon arrival to the ICU. Her pressures remained
normotensive while in the ICU. Blood, urine, and stool cultures
were drawn. She was treated empirically with antibiotics for a
suspected GI source given her abdominal pain and history of
diarrhea.
- see colitis below
.
# Colitis, Ischemic vs Infectious.
CT Abd performed in the ED showed bowel wall thickening
concerning for ischemic vs. infectious colitis. The patient and
her family expressed that surgical management was not an option
and she was managed conservatively with antibiotics and fluid
resuscitation. Her diarrhea resolved and her pain was controlled
with morphine. She has remained abdominal pain-free on the
floor, and is now tolerating a regular diet.
Pt is being treated with Cipro/flagyl with plan for 10 day
course to end [**6-18**]. (Cipro dosing remains appropriate for renal
function)
Pt's diet was advanced, and she tolerated a regular diet without
difficulty.
.
# MSSA UTI
A urine culture grew MSSA and she was started on IV vancomycin.
This was later changed to dicloxacillin (avoided Bactrim d/t
potential renal toxicity). D1 of appropriate antibiotics was
[**6-8**]. Plan for 14 day course to complete [**6-22**].
.
# Coronary artery disease/Malignant hypertension.
The patient has a h/o CAD s/p CABG. Her blood pressure
medications were intially held out of concern for hypotension.
Pt became very hypertensive, with max SBP 220, but asymptomatic.
Her home BP medications were resumed, and her BP is under
improved control.
- Contin Labetolol to home dose 100 mg po bid
- contin Lisinopril 10 mg po q day
- Contin Nifedipine SR 30 mg po q day
- Want to avoid possible hypotension, as may have led to
ischemic colitis as possible inciting event.  It is important
for patient to maintain adequate hydration to avoid further
episodes.
- contin asprin / statin
.
# Acute renal failure.
The patient's creatinine improved with fluid resuscitation.
Renal function continues to improve.
- avoid renal toxins
.
# Goals of care. contin DNR/DNI. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] discussing possible
bridge to hospice.
