Date of Birth:  [**2054-12-25**]             Sex:   M

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Hurricaine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2121-1-20**] 1. Placement of two epicardial left ventricular pacing
leads via a left anterior thoracotomy. 2. Evacuation of hematoma
from previously- placed pacemaker generator in the upper left
pectoralis region.


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 65yo M with a PMH significant for DM, HTN, HL, COPD,
left atrial tumor resection in [**2118**], s/p mechanical AVR [**2106**],
s/p pacemaker most recently revised in [**2120-11-20**], transferred for
a-flutter ablation/ BIV ICD placement/pacemaker removal and
initiation of Dofetilide. The patient states that he has had
occasional palpitations without any specific pattern or inciting
events. The patient states that he has had rare episodes of SOB.
He states that he can walk several blocks without SOB/ CP. These
symptoms have improved with lasix. The patient denied
orthopnea/PND. The patient does have c/o lower ext edema that
has also improved since initiation of his lasix.
.
The patient reports that he has had drainage from a pin-point
lesion from his pacer site that began a few weeks after the
revision on [**2121-11-20**]. He states it was a rusty color and no
visble pus. He denied fevers, chills, or other systemic signs of
infection. He was starte on Keflex and the wound healed. The
lesion opened up again and began to drain again about 2 weeks
ago. He was again started on Keflex and is still currently
taking it.
.
Patient underwent an isthmus ablation on [**2120-1-14**] for his
a-flutter. Started on dofetilide. On [**2120-1-15**] BiV ICD placement
was attempted, but the LV lead could not be placed; therefore,
he only received a dual chamber pacer on the left. His old
right-sided generator was removed, with the old leads left in.
After the procedure, he experienced dyspnea, desating to the 80s
on 4L NC. ABG 7.36/43/83. He received furosemide 20 mg IV x 1
and ondansetron for nausea. CXR revealed no PTX. Got a dose of
gentamicin--already on vancomycin for old pacer site infection.
Transferred to CCU for close monitoring. Cardiac surgery was
consulted on epicardial lead placement.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient looked comfortable, no longer
dyspneic. Oxygen was weaned down to 2L NC.

[**2121-1-16**] TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis with septal dyskinesis (LVEF
= 40-45 %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with normal free wall contractility. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
[**2121-1-20**] Intraop TEE:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40
%). with mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical aortic
valve prosthesis is present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 65yo M with a PMH significant for DM, HTN, HL,
COPD, left atrial tumor resection in [**2118**], s/p mechanical AVR
[**2106**], s/p pacemaker most recently revised in [**2120-11-20**],
transferred for a-flutter ablation/ BIV ICD placement/pacemaker
removal and initiation of dofetilide, transferred to CCU after
having respiratory distress after attempted BiV ICD placement.

Patient underwent an isthmus ablation on [**2120-1-14**] for his
a-flutter. Started on dofetilide. On [**2120-1-15**] BiV ICD placement
was attempted, but the LV lead could not be placed; therefore,
he only received a dual chamber pacer on the left. His old
right-sided generator was removed, with the old leads left in.

After the procedure, he experienced dyspnea, desatting to the
80s on 4L NC. ABG 7.36/43/83. He received furosemide 20 mg IV x
1 and ondansetron for nausea. CXR revealed no PTX. He received
of gentamicin and was already on vancomycin for old pacer site
infection. He was transferred to CCU for closer monitoring.

In the CCU, the patient had an expanding hematoma on chest wall
over the site of hte new pacer.  A pressure dressing was
applied.  Patient received 2 units packed RBC (along with
several liters of fluid).  Hct was stable.

CT surgery was consulted and agreed to place an epicardial lead
on [**2121-1-20**].

Postoperatively, his heart failure therapy was resumed and EP
service continued to titrate his anti-arrhythm
