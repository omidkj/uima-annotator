Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain and back pain with hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization

History of Present Illness:
Patient 83 year old female with PMHx significant for
hypercholesteremia who presented to OSH on [**12-21**] when she
developed chest pain that radiated to her back. She describes
the pain as a dull pain (not sharp or tearing pain). Patient
denies any SOB, n/v, diaphoresis. Patient states that associated
with her chest pain was confusion and trouble speaking(trouble
finding words to speak). Patient then became weak and had a fall
(did not hit her head). Patient denies LOC. At OSH patient found
to be hypotensive (59/37), got CT which r/o aortic dissection.
Patient intially started on levophed and later requiring
dobutamine. No explaination of decreased BP found per report of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**] and ICU RN at OSH. Pt tachycardic on dobutamine so
weaned off and switched to dopamine. Patient had EKG done at
outside hospital which showed sinus bradycardia with ST
depression II,III,AVF, V5-V6 and J pt elevation in leads V2-V4.
Cardiac enzymes done at OSH showed CK 363, CK-MB 33, TropI 6.78.
Echo done at OSH reported as consistent with "apical MI" but
preserved EF. Given EKG changes, increased cardiac enzymes and,
and echo findings patient transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP): No priors for comparison. There is an
intrafemoral Swan-Ganz catheter with its tip in satisfactory
position, in the proximal portion of the right interlobar
pulmonary artery. There is prominent, ill- defined pulmonary
vasculature, with bilateral CP blunting, likely consistent with
moderately sized bilateral pleural effusions. These findings are
consistent with congestive heart failure. There is no obvious
underlying consolidation, however, a basilar process cannot be
excluded. No pneumothorax. Visualized soft tissue and osseous
structures are unremarkable.

Cardiac Cath:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
no
significant angiographically apparent coronary disease.  The
left main
coronary artery, LAD, LCx, and RCA demonstrated minimal luminal
irregularities.
2.  Resting hemodynamics were performed.  Right sided filling
pressures
were moderately elevated (RA mean pressure was 16 mm Hg and
RVEDP was 19
mm Hg).  Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated (PA

pressure was 53/22 mm Hg).  Left sided filling pressures were
moderately
to severely elevated (mean PCW pressure was 28 mm Hg and LVEDP
was 30 mm
Hg).  Prominent V waves were noted in the PCW tracing consistent
with
mitral regurgitation. Cardiac index was low normal (at 2.4
L/min/m2).
There was no significant gradient across the aortic valve upon
pullback
of the catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated left
ventricular ejection fraction of 39%.  Severe anteroapical,
apical, and
inferoapical akinesis to dyskinesis was noted.  2+ mitral
regurgitation
was noted.

Echo ([**12-23**]): LVEF 25-30%
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction
with the apical half of the LV being akinetic. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is a trivial pericardial effusion.

Echo: ([**12-25**]): LVEF 35%-40%
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular chamber size
is normal.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include mid to distal
anteroseptal
and apical hypokinesis/akinesis Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve
appears structurally normal with mild mitral regurgitation. The
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is trivial
pericardial
effusion.
Comapred to the prior study of [**2165-12-23**] (tape reviewed), left
ventricular
systolic function appears slightly improved.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE: Less than 40% right ICA stenosis. No
stenosis of the left ICA.

EKG [**12-22**]: sinus at 98 TWI in V3-V6 flat Twaves and low voltage
in limb leads.




Brief Hospital Course:
## Cardiomyopathy - Unclear etiology.  Differential include
takotsubo, coronary vasospasm, myocarditis.  Patient from cath
revealed no
significant angiographically apparent coronary disease.  The
left main
coronary artery, LAD, LCx, and RCA demonstrated minimal luminal
irregularities.  Based on history and cath film most likely
takotsubo.  On admission patient initial echo revealed an LVEF
of 25-30% with LV apical akinesis.  Based on akinesis patient
was put on heparin for anticoagulation.  However her platelet
count dropped from 140 to 75 after two days in hospital so
heparin stopped and HITT antibody sent.  Patient was started on
argatroban to anticoagulate until HITT Ab results came back.
HITT Ab came back negative so patient started back on heparin
and coumadin.  Her platelets remained stable after being
restarted on heparin and coumadin.  Patient had TSH and iron
studies sent which came back normal.  Patient also had
edenovirus and [**Location (un) **] virus antigens sent which were pending
upon discharge.  While in hospital patient started on
beta-blocker and ACEI.  On exam patient appeared wet and CXR
consitent with CHF so patient given prn doses of lasix which she
responded very well to.  During hospital course patient had
second episode of chest pain (without EKG changes) but with
enzyme leak.  Her chest pain seemed to last a few hours and
resolved with SL nitro.  Felt that chest pain maybe secondary to
vasospasm so patient started on long acting nitrate Imdur.  She
remained chest pain free while on Imdur.

## Hypotension - After cath patient was still hypotensive and
was initially kept on dopamine.  Cause of hypotension was felt
to be most likely due to cardiomyopathy event (Takotsubo).
However patient also spiked a fever on HD #2 and blood, urine
cultures sent which showed no growth.  Patient never looked
septic while in hospital and had normal WBC.  Patient was
eventually taken off dopamine and BP continued to improve.

## ?TIA - From history of slurred speech and weakness with CP
sympto
