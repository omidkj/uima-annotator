HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57-year-old
woman with multiple medical problems including coronary
artery disease, status post inferior Q wave MI in [**2184**], COPD,
CHF/MR who presented to outside hospital with progressive
shortness of breath and chest pain.  The patient was noted to
be hypoxic and was intubated.  She had a severe respiratory
acidosis with a PH of 6.99 shortly after intubation.  EKG
showed old inferior Q waves and [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in the
anterior leads.  She was initially started on Heparin and
Nitroglycerin for ischemia.  A TTE was performed emergently
on [**1-16**] and showed hyperdynamic LV function with an EF of
75%.  Small amount of inferobasilar wall hypokinesis, trace
TR, normal aortic valve, [**1-28**]+ MR and normal RV function.  The
patient ruled out for MI with negative enzymes.  The patient
was extubated on [**1-17**] although she was still requiring 50%
FIO2 and ventilating well with normal PH.  She was fatigued
but not retaining CO2 and tolerated extubation early in a.m.
on [**1-18**] when she was noted to be in severe respiratory
distress, tachycardic to 150 and hypertensive to 160/112, O2
sat on 100% non rebreather.  The patient was given 100 mg IV
Lasix.  Chest x-ray showed flash pulmonary edema.  The
patient was also having long runs of V tach and given
Lidocaine 100 mg IV bolus.  She had a seizure for which she
was given Ativan.  The patient was intubated.  A repeat TTE
was performed and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and remained
intubated on the coronary care unit service.  Repeat TTE at
[**Hospital1 69**] showed severe MR and a
hypodynamic left ventricular function.  The patient was
requiring Levophed for blood pressure support.  The patient
was started empirically on Vancomycin, Flagyl and Levaquin
for presumed sepsis.  The patient was aggressively diuresed
in the CCU.  Cardiac catheterization demonstrated severe MR.
[**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]-aortic balloon pump was placed.  Cardiothoracic
surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] for mitral valve replacement and one
