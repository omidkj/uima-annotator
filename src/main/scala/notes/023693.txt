Service:  ACOVE Medicine Service

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for
questionable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
schizoaffective disorder, dementia, and hypertension who was
admitted for fever and shortness of breath.

The patient is a resident of [**Hospital3 **] Home; where,
on the day of admission, she was noted to develop acute
shortness of breath, wheezing, and fevers.  Her oxygen
saturations were transiently in the 70s.  She was then placed
on supplemental oxygen at which time her saturations improved
to the 90s, but she then desaturated again on a nonrebreather
mask.  She was also given albuterol nebulizers and one dose
of levofloxacin.  Given her continued hypoxemia, the patient
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation.

Upon arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient's blood
pressure was stable at 142/62 with a heart rate of 102.  She
was in mild respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of
24 and was saturating 96% on 4 liters.  However, since her
arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient became
hypotensive.  She was aggressively fluid resuscitated and
received a 4-liter boluses.  Her blood pressure stabilized;
however, she then developed increased shortness of breath.
The patient was placed on a face mask and given a dose of
levofloxacin, clindamycin, and Solu-Medrol.  She was then
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation
and stabilization.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any current alcohol or
tobacco abuse, but records revealed a history of alcohol
dependence and current tobacco abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Physical examination
revealed vital signs with a temperature of 99.9 degrees
Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 98/49, her heart rate was
93, her respiratory rate was 23, and her oxygen saturation
was 95%.  General physical examination revealed an obese and
lethargic female.  She obeyed simple commands and responded
to simple questions only.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  The
pupils were 2 mm and reactive.  The sclerae were anicteric.
The oropharynx was clear.  The mucous membranes were moist.
Neck examination revealed the neck was supple.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination revealed distant
heart sounds.  There was a regular rate.  No murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  The lung examination revealed coarse breath
sounds bilaterally with diminished air movement in the right
upper lobe.  She was using abdominal muscles while breathing.
The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and nondistended.
There were normal bowel sounds.  The liver edge was 2 cm to 3
cm below the costal margin.  Extremity examination revealed
1+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Neurologic examination
revealed the patient responded to simple commands.  She had
garbled speech.  Otherwise, the patient was uncooperative
with neurologic examination.  The patient moved her
extremities times four.  The toes were downgoing.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed the patient's white blood cell count was 7.8, her
hematocrit was 32.8, and her platelets were 192.  The
patient's sodium was 136, potassium was 3.8, chloride was 95,
bicarbonate was 32, blood urea nitrogen was 18, and her
creatinine was 0.9.   Urinalysis was negative.  Arterial
blood gas revealed 7.31/57/86.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was consistent
with increased fluid overload and congestive heart failure.
No infiltrates.

Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia at 102.  There
were flat T waves in leads V3 through V6, I, aVL, II, III,
and aVF.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  FEVER AND HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was
transferred from her nursing home with a fever.  Upon arrival
in the Emergency Department, she was afebrile but soon became
hypotensive and required significant fluid resuscitation.
The patient's examination on admission was consistent with
shock, and there was concern that the patient might be
septic.

The patient was started on levofloxacin and clindamycin
initially, and her cultures were followed.  Her blood
pressure remained stable following the initial fluid bolus.
Cultures were followed, and no organism was isolated.  The
patient was thought to likely have a bronchitis, as no clear
infiltrate was every isolated on her chest x-rays.  She was
continued on levofloxacin and was to complete a 10-day
course.

2.  HYPOXEMIA ISSUES:  The patient was hypoxic prior to
admission at her nursing home.  This was thought to represent
a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with a
superimposed infectious process.

Following arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient
was initially stable on a face mask.  However, following
fluid resuscitation, her hypoxemia worsened.  This was likely
due to congestive heart failure.  A subsequent chest x-ray
did show significant fluid overload.

The patient was gently diuresed in the setting of infection.
She also was started on nebulizers and prednisone to treat
her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.  The
patient was briefly on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure on
the Unit but was then placed back on oxygen via face mask.
As her symptoms improved, she was slowly weaned off the
oxygen.  On the day of discharge, the patient was saturating
well on room air.

3.  CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE EXACERBATION
ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with an extensive smoking
history and a questionable diagnosis of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  She was started nebulizers and a
prednisone taper before being transitioned over to inhalers,
and a steroid inhaler was added.  The patient was stable on
this regimen and was quickly weaned off oxygen.  She was
discharged on by mouth prednisone with a taper to be
continued over the week.  She was also to continue to use her
meter-dosed inhalers as prescribed.

4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient was
admitted without a history of congestive heart failure or
coronary artery disease; except for her hypertension.

The patient did develop congestive heart failure soon after
admission with aggressive fluid resuscitation.  This did
resolve with diuresis.  She was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction with her cardiac enzymes negative.  She was also
started on aspirin, and her hypertensive medications were
added back.  The plan was for the patient to have cardiac
followup as an outpatient when her current symptoms had
stabilized.

The patient was instructed to follow up with her primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] stress test will be arranged in the near
future after discharge.

5.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient's blood pressure
medications were initially held on admission given concern
for sepsis and her initial hypotension.  However, her blood
pressure stabilized, and as she actually did become
hypertensive at this point, she was started back on her
verapamil and dyazide per her home regimen which she
tolerated well.

6.  SCHIZOAFFECTIVE DISORDER ISSUES:  The patient was
admitted with a complicated psychiatric history including
schizoaffective disorder, depression, and a history of
suicide attempts.  She also has a component of dementia.

The patient was lethargic and confused on admission w
