CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and cough.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year old
woman with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic
renal failure, congestive heart failure, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and atrial fibrillation.  She presented
with a three day history of increasing shortness of breath,
cough and fevers.  The patient normally requires oxygen at
home (started [**10-28**]), however, she has appreciated increasing
shortness of breath and cough producing green sputum for the
three days prior to presentation.  She also states that she
has had chills for one day prior to presentation.  She states
that she has been short of breath since [**2122-6-27**], and has
been hospitalized once when she required mechanical
ventilation.  She states by the fall of [**2120**], she could walk
approximately one half mile and go up one flight of stairs.
Of note, the patient underwent cardiac catheterization after
her mitral valve repair and aortic valve repair in [**2122-6-27**].
Cardiac catheterization showed a 50% left anterior descending
stenosis.  She was admitted in [**Month (only) 359**] of that same year for
congestive heart failure, oxygen saturation down to 85% on
ambulating.  Her ejection fraction on echocardiography was
greater than 55% and she was discharged on home oxygen after
being diagnosed with congestive heart failure secondary to
diastolic dysfunction.

She underwent outpatient evaluation with pulmonary function
testing which showed normal lung function with the exception
of decreased diffusion capacity and a computed tomogram nine
days prior to presentation showed moderate emphysema.  The
patient denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
increased lower extremity edema or weight changes.  However,
she states she did have chest pain in the Emergency
Department.  Her oxygen saturation there was 84% and she had
a temperature of 102.6.  She received Levofloxacin 500 mg
intravenously for a chest x-ray suggestive of pneumonia.  She
also received Furosemide 40 mg intravenously twice followed
by another 60 mg once.  She had arterial blood gas performed
there as well which showed 7.47/37/59 on six liters nasal
cannula.  She received Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers
with resolution of her chest pain.  She also was placed on
intravenous Nitroglycerin drip, temporarily placed on BiPAP
due to increased respiratory rate and distress.  Her repeat
blood gas was as follows:  7.42/43/61 with an oxygen
saturation of 95% in room air on BiPAP.  She was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for treatment of pneumonia.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Status post mitral valve repair and aortic valve repair.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Coronary artery disease.
8.  Chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine of 2.1 to
2.6.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q6hours.
2.  Warfarin 2 mg in the evening.
3.  Furosemide 40 mg twice a day.
4.  Atenolol 75 mg daily.
5.  Atorvastatin 10 mg in the evening.
6.  Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. once daily.
8.  Lorazepam 1 mg in the evening as needed.
9.  Iron Sulfate.
10. Vitamin D.
11. Calcium Carbonate.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone.  She quit smoking tobacco
fifteen years ago.  She has a previous forty pack year
history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 101, heart rate 56,
blood pressure 124/38, respiratory rate 36, oxygen saturation
94% on four liters.  Blood gases as stated above.  In
general, she is a pleasant elderly woman in moderate
respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat -
Moist mucous membranes.  Extraocular movements are intact.
The throat is clear.  Neck reveals no jugular venous
distention.  There is no hepatojugular reflux.  There is no
lymphadenopathy.  Chest - Bibasilar crackles and rhonchi
without wheezing.  Heart - Irregularly irregular, normal S1
and S2, I/VI systolic murmur at the apex.  Abdomen - Normal
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, organs are not
palpable.  Extremities - Warm with trace lower extremity
edema.  Vascular - +2 dorsalis pedis pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.6, hematocrit
35.1, platelet count 234,000.  Initial chemistry panel was
significant for a hemolyzed potassium specimen level of 7.4
and the repeat was 4.4.  Serial CK and troponin levels
revealed myocardial infarction.  Urinalysis showed a urinary
tract infection as well.

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 55 beats per
minute, normal axis, approximately 1.0 millimeter ST segment
depressions in limb leads II and III, as well as anterior
leads V4 through V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After a brief stay in the Intensive Care
Unit, the patient was transferred to the Medical floor after
her oxygen requirement decreased and she was able to maintain
adequate oxygen saturation without mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination upon transfer was significant for
temperature of 98.2, heart rate 80, blood pressure 122/44,
oxygen saturation 92% on four liters.  Lung examination at
that point revealed decreased breath sounds at both bases
with dullness bilaterally and egophony at the right base.
[**Doctor Last Name **] was poor air movement and bilateral wheezing.  With the
exception of trace pedal edema, the remainder of the
examination was unchanged.

The remainder of the hospital course was summarized by
systems.

1.  Pneumonia - The patient continued to receive Levofloxacin
250 mg every 48 hours (dose was decreased given the patient's
chronic renal failure). She had decreased cough.  There was
no sputum production and her oxygen requirements decreased to
no supplementation except while walking.  This represents
return to her baseline as described above.  The patient
received bronchodilator therapy for two days while on the
Medical floor after transfer from the Intensive Care Unit for
persistent wheezing.  This resolved prior to her discharge.

2.  Cardiology - The patient was continued on her Warfarin
anticoagulation with adequate maintenance of anticoagulation.
There were no changes made in her Aspirin, Atorvastatin,
Hydralazine or Metoprolol doses.  Likewise, she remained free
of congestive heart failure on her standing Furosemide dose.

3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease - No changes were made in
her proton pump inhibitor for the duration of her hospital
stay.

4.  Depression - No changes were made in her selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

5.  Osteoporosis - For osteoporosis, the patient was
continued on Calcium Carbonate and Vitamin D.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was evaluated by physical therapy
service and deemed safe to go home.  VNA services were also
arranged for her to have outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation
evaluation.  Her home oxygen was also reinitiated.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Rheumatic heart disease, status post aortic valve and
mitral valve repair.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Depression.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
8.  Osteoporosis.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was discharged to home with
evaluation for home pulmonary physical rehabilitation.  She
was instructed to make an appointment with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] , within two weeks.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
