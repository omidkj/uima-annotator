Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2150-4-21**] Mitral Valve Repair(30mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] Band) and Three Vessel
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting utilizing the LIMA to LAD, and
saphenous vein grafts to OM and PDA.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15582**] is a 57 year old male with known coronary artery
disease. He had recent complaints of increasing dyspnea on
exertion and chest discomfort. Recent stress echo was "abnormal"
showing an LVEF of 30% with anteroapical and inferobasal
hypokinesis along with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
He subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed
worsening three vessel coronary artery disease. Based upon the
above, he underwent routine preoperative evaluation and was
eventually cleared for cardiac surgical intervention.

Physical Exam:
PREOP EXAM
Vitals: 120/85, 100, 16
General: WDWN male in no acute distress
HEENT: Oropharynx benign, EOMI
Neck: Supple, no JVD
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal s1s2, no murmur or rub
Abdomen: Soft, nontender with normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: Warm, no edema
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: Alert and oriented, CN 2- 12 grossly intact, no focal
deficits noted

Pertinent Results:
[**2150-4-21**] Intraop TEE:
PRE CPB - The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). There is some
septal hypokinesis and the anterior wall is close to being
akinetic. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
It is centrally directed and likely due to mitral annular
dilitation.

POST CPB - The patient is receiving epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and milrinone by infusion. An intra-aortic balloon pump has been
placed with its tip 2 cm below the distal aortic arch. There is
normal right ventricular systolic function. The right ventricle,
initially, appears underfilled. The left ventricle displays more
septal dyskinesis than in the pre-CPB study. There is inferior
and inferolateral severe hypokinesis. The anterior wall function
is improved. Overall EF is still about 20-25%. A mitral valve
annuloplasty ring is in situ. It appears well seated. There is
trivial mitral regurgitation. The peak gradient across the
mitral valve is 11.5 mm Hg with a mean of 8 mm Hg.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
57 year old man with s/p cabg mv repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? infiltrate
HISTORY: CABG and MV repair.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-27**], the right IJ
catheter has been removed. Again there is enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette and intact multiple midline sternotomy wires.
Mild blunting of the left costophrenic angle persists.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15582**] was admitted and taken directly to the operating
room where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting and a mitral valve repair. Operative course was notable
for prophylactic placement of an IABP given his very poor
ejection fraction and severe mitral regurgitation. In addition,
he required multiple inotropes to wean from cardiopulmonary
bypass. For additional surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CVICU in critical condition.

He remained pressor dependent and remained intubated for several
days. He maintained good urine output while on a Lasix drip.
Around postoperative day 2 to 3, developed atrial fibrillation
for which he was started on Amiodarone. Also started on broad
spectrum antibiotics for postoperative fevers associated with
copious, yellow respiratory secretions. He continued to
experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but over several
days, his heart rate and hemodynamics improved.  The IABP was
eventually removed without complication and pressors were
gradually weaned. Once off all inotropic support, he was
extubated on postoperative five. Sputum cultures eventually grew
out Moraxella catarrhalis for which antibiotics were titrated
accordingly. He was also noted to have a lower extremity
cellulitis and started on warm compresses. He will need a 7 day
course of ciprofloxacin for both.

He transferred to the SDU on postoperative day six. Given
postoperative atrial fibrillation, he was started on Warfarin
anticoagulation.

He did well and was ready for discharge home on POD #8.
