Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells on [**2143-9-4**].


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o F with hx of CAD, CHF, HTN, DM and PVD with recent DVT
and IVC filter and GI bleed presented with worsening LE edema
and blisters. She also had been just seen by nephrologist who
was concerned about anemia, and possible decompensated heart
failure as cause of LE edema.

She has had worsening of her LE edema, and chronic pain in her
legs. No fevers, chills. She has severe PVD and R toe necrosis
and well as bilateral heel ulcers. She had an IVC filter placed
approximately 1 week ago. She denied any chest pain, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills. She
had not noticed any blood in her stool or urine. She came in
from rehab, hated it, and had been having worsening depression.


On review of systems, she denied any fever, chills, night
sweats, headache, vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore
throat, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, hematochezia,
dysuria, hematuria.

Social History:
Currently coming from rehab.  Has family in the area whom she

use.

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
On admission to the floor, vitals were: temperature 99, blood
pressure 147/58, heart rate 74, respiratory rate 20, oxygen
saturation 98% on room air.  General examination revealed an
obese, elderly lady in no acute distress.  Her jugular venous
pressure was less than 10 and her cardiac exam showed regular
rate and rhythm, without rubs, murmurs or gallops.  Exam of the
lower extremities revealed 2+ edema and right 1st-3rd toes with
necrotic black tissue, no warm or surrounding erythema, no
lymphangetic spreading; bilateral heel ulcers also without
erythema or signs of infection; L dorsum of foot with multiple
vesicles, L lateral shin with skin tear and scant weeping and
bleeding.  The remainder of the exam, including pulmonary,
neurologic and abdominal components, was normal.

TESTING
[**2142-9-5**] LENIs:  Partial thrombus is again seen in the right
common femoral vein and occlusive thrombus is again seen in the
right superficial femoral vein. On today's exam, there is
incomplete compression of the left common femoral vein
demonstrating nonocclusive thrombus. Images of the left
superficial femoral vein demonstrate no flow on color Doppler
imaging and this vein does not compress. This is consistent with
deep vein thrombosis. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable appearing DVT in the
right superficial femoral vein with non-occlusive thrombus in
the right common femoral vein. 2. New deep vein thrombosis
identified within the left superficial femoral vein and new
nonocclusive thrombus seen within the left common femoral vein.

[**2143-9-2**] EKG:  Sinus rhythm. Short P-R interval. Late R wave
progression. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing
of [**2143-8-15**] probably no significant change.

[**2143-9-2**] CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly
enlarged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleura
effusion or pneumothorax is seen. There is a stable, rounded
retrocardiac opacity, best seen on the lateral view, which is
unchanged since [**2143-5-21**], and felt to represent focal
dilatation of the esophagus as seen on prior CT. Median
sternotomy wires and clips in the epigastric region are
unchanged. No acute osseous abnormalities are noted. IMPRESSION:
1. Mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 2.
Stable retrocardiac opacity, consistent with esophageal
dilatation seen on prior CT.

[**2143-8-14**] LENIs: 1. Extensive deep venous thrombus extending from
the right common femoral vein through the posterior tibial vein
on the right side.
2. Normal left deep venous system without evidence of DVT.

[**2143-5-28**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. The overall left
ventricular ejection fraction is normal (LVEF 60%). However, the
basal anterior septum is fibrotic and akinetic, and the basal
inferior septum and apex are hypokinetic. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
focal wall motion abnormalities in the left ventricle with a
normal ejection fraction

Brief Hospital Course:
68F with hx of CAD, CHF, DM, PVD and DVT who presents with
worsening LE edema in setting of IVC filter placement 2 weeks
ago for RLE DVTs as well as low hematocrit at 26.6 on admission
found to have new LLE DVTs.  Her hospital course is detailed
below:

Lower extremity edema/new LLE DVTs:  Worsening lower extremity
edema was thought to be attributable to increased clot burden in
the lower extremities, with possible contributions from heart
failure (with elevated BNP).  Bilateral lower extremity venous
ultrasound on [**2143-9-5**] revealed new deep vein thrombosis
within the left superficial femoral vein and new nonocclusive
thrombus within the left common femoral vein. Vascular therapy
was consulted, and no further therapy initiated at this time as
anticoagulation is contraindicated due to recent history of a
severe gastrointestinal bleed, and the patient already has an
IVC filter in place. Patient has follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]
from vascular surgery. Educated to use waffle boots at night,
compression stockings, and leg elevation.

Anemia: Patient had a normocytic anemia with a hematocrit of
26.6 on admission, down significantly from her baseline around
31.7 on [**2143-8-15**].  Guaiac testing was negative, and iron
studies were not suggestive of deficiency.  She likely has
anemia of chronic disease.  She was transfused 1 unit of packed
red blood cells on [**2143-9-4**] with a good response (3 point
increase in hematocrit).  She may benefit from treatment with
erythropoeitin as an outpatient, in the setting of chronic renal
insufficiency.
