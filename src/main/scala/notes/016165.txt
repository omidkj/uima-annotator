Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64 year old man with relapsed [**Hospital **] transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after being admitted for febrile neutropenia,
found to have MRSA bacteremia, pneumonia, course complicated by
Afib with RVR, acute renal failure, short course in the MICU.
.
# AML relapse: Very high blast count (95-98%), received DLI on
[**2136-12-21**].  He was started on hydroxyurea as well as stress dose
steroids, which should be continued at the discretion of his
outpatient oncologist.  He was transfused as needed for blood
and platelets. He was also continued on allopurinol and
hydroxyurea. His uric acid was low at time of discharge.
.
# Bacteremia/Pneumonia: MRSA bacteremia, still febrile on broad
spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin, imipenem and azithromycin.
Caspofungin was started ([**2136-12-20**]) to cover for fungal source of
the fever.  Vancomycin was renally dosed.  He was started on
standing tylenol 1g q6h to prevent fever and subsequent afib
with rvr.  Ativan prn for shortness of breath. Blood and urine
cultures with no growth to date at time of discharge.
.
# Acute Renal Failure: Likely [**2-23**] Afib/flutter with RVR causing
CHF with poor forward flow. Minimized fluids, patient was given
blood in lieu of fluids.  He was given IV Lasix, to help with
diuresis, and his creatinine was monitored closely.  It was
increasing at the time of discharge, but it was felt that given
his tenuous breathing situation, diuresis was important.
.
# A.fib/flutter: Initally, patient was on a diltiazem drip on
admission, which had controlled his rate during his past
hospitalization.  Initally it was controlling his rate, but then
he was persistently in the 140s near the limit of diltiazem.  He
was transitioned to an esmolol drip, and then eventually to
metoprolol PO, which helped maintain his heart rate in the 110.
However, his rate climbed into the 150's the follo
