Attending:[**Known lastname 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intra arterial balloon pump placed [**2145-1-27**].

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 56-yo Caucasian gentleman with CAD (h/o longstanding
angina) poorly controlled HTN, hyperlipidemia who was
transferred from an OSH with acute CHF s/p v fib arrest with
severe 3 vessel disease on cardiac cath., not ammenable to PCI.

.
Per pt., he was in his usual state of health until the day prior
to admission when he began to experience worsening chest pain
after breakfast at McDonald's. He describes the pain as his
typical anginal pain, with some substernal CP and tightness in
the neck. However, the pain was constant this time and not
relieved by nitroglycerin. He also reports two episodes of
vomitting and one episode of diarrhea during this time. The pain
continued unrelieved overnight and worsened until the afternoon
of admission when the patient's son finally called 911. On
arrival of EMS, he was pale and diaphoretic and then went into V
fib arrest, was shocked twice in the field, bolused with 100mg
of lidocaine and converted to sinus rhythm. He was then
ventilated via a BVM, started on aspirin 324mg, lidocaine drip
and taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for an emergent cath. EKG in the
field showed transient anterior ST elevations in V2 and V3 which
resolved. CK 1237. He was found on cath to have severe 3 vessel
disease not ammenable to PCI with 99% occlusion of the mid LAD,
99% mid circ, 99% large OM, and 100% RCA with collaterals. PCWP
of 42, PAP 58/30. Estimated LVEF 15%. During his cath he
received Lasix 20 mg IV x1, then an additional 60 mg IV x 1. He
also received Heparin 4000u x 1 and gtt, lopressor 5 mg IV x 2,
lipitor 80 mg po x 1, and was started on a nitro gtt. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU via medical helicopter for
stabilization and possible further surgical magament of his CAD.

.
Of note, pt. reports worsening dyspnea on exertion but denies
any previous heart attacks, no orthopnea, no PND. He reports a 5
year h/o chest pain (substernal with some neck tightness)
typically relieved by nitro and atenolol.

Past Medical History:
angina symptoms - no prior caths/documented CAD
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
.
Meds at home:
atenolol 100 mg qd (restarted two weeks ago)
SL nitro - uses it many times a day, everyday, for years


Social History:
90 pack per year h/o of smoking, no h/o alcohol or drugs. Lives
with his wife at home and works as a fisherman on [**Hospital3 **].

Family History:
Grandfather died of MI at age 69? Father - ALS

Physical Exam:

in bed, uncomfortable, tachypneic and diaphoretic but in NAD.
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.
SKIN: No gross lesions or rashes.
LUNGS: Diffuse late expiratory wheezes in anterior lung fields.

HEART: Distant heart sounds, tachycardic, regular rhythm, nl S1,
S2, no m/r/g. JVP not appreciated secondary to body habitus.

sounds.
EXT: Warm, no edema, 1+ pedal pulses in bilateral lower
extremities, R. femoral artery sheath in place.
NEURO: A & O X3, appropriate, no focal neurologic deficits.


Pertinent Results:

V2 and V3. Q waves in II, II, a VF, V4-V6.
.
Studies:

MARG2 (Ostial), Diffuse 99% lesion
RCA: (Mid) 100% lesion
Ventricle: 15% LVEF estimated, LV function markedly reduced with
severe global hypokinesis.
Aortogram shows severe right ileofemoral disease and moderate
left iliofemoral disease.
.
Dobutamine Echo ([**1-26**]):
The patient received intravenous dobutamine in 5 min (low
dose5mcg/kg/min) for 5 minutes. Resting images were acquired at
a heart rate of 130 bpm and a blood pressure of 99/68 mmHg.
These demonstrated extensive regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal near akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the
septum and anterior wall and severe hypokinesis of the inferior
and inferolateral wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and
akinetic. After 5mcg/kg/min, there was augmentation of the basal
and mid-septum with no change in other regions. Mild mitral
regurgitation is seen.

FINDINGS:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. The basal septum and
anterior walls contract best. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/near
akinesis of the inferior, inferolateral and distal 2/3rds of the
septum and anterior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal and
akinetic. A left ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a very small, circumferential pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
CXR ([**1-26**]):
An intraaortic balloon pump terminates 6.5 cm below the aortic
arch.  A femoral Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the main
pulmonary artery.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits.  Bilateral pulmonary edema appears
slightly more prominent than on prior exam.  Left retrocardiac
opacity has decreased in density and may represent resolving
pneumonia or atelectasis.  Peripherally based right upper lobe
opacity is slightly more prominent than on prior exam, possibly
representing an evolving pneumonia.  Surrounding soft tissue and
osseous structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Mild interval worsening in pulmonary edema.
2.  Increase in prominence of right apical consolidation,
concerning for
evolving pneumonia.  Recommend follow-up.
3.  Improved aeration at left lung base likely related to
resolving
atelectasis.
