Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line

History of Present Illness:
72 yo M with DM2, HTN, h/o L carotid artery stenosis now p/w
shortness of breath. The patient was in his usual state of
health until yesterday when he had poor PO intake due to
anorexia. He was driving when he noted marked weakness. States
his vision has been fluctuating recently (due to L cataract) but
seemed worse. Upon returning to his house he had significant
difficulty ambulating up a flight of stairs. The patient had to
sit on the steps and states it was difficult for him to raise
his head up or his arms. States he tried to "scoot" up the
stairs but felt that he pulled a muscle in his L side.
.
On ROS he notes that he took antibiotics a couple of months ago
for an upper resp infection. States this initially improved, but
then for the last month he has noted some yellow sputum
production. He denies any abdominal complaints, including no
nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. At baseline he has severe DOE and
it takes him "awhile" to get up his stairs to his apartment.
Denies PND, orthopnea, chest pain. No LE edema. No fevers,
chills, night sweats.
.
In the ED, T 98.4 at presentation with a spike to 101.4, hr 78,
bp 81/40, rr 22, 94% RA improving to 99% 3L. He received aspirin
325mg po, levofloxacin 500mg IV, flagyl 500mg IV, Acetominophen
1g, and was started on Norepinephrine for persistent
hypotension.

Pertinent Results:
admission WBC 17.5, 85% N 10% L, Hct 44.1, Lactate 2.4. Most
recent WBC 11.1, Hct 37.1, Lactate 1.1, LFT's within normal
limits. Na 146, BUN/Cr 30/2.5.
iron 54, tibc 231, ferritin 200, folate > 20, b12 629
cortisol 13.0
.
Micro:
Blood culture ([**2168-5-21**]) x2 sets: no growth
Urine culture ([**2168-5-21**]): no growth
.
EKG ([**2168-5-21**]): Sinus rhythm with a rate of 78. Normal axis.
Less than 1mm ST depressions in V4-6, unchanged from prior.
.
Imaging:
CXR ([**2168-5-21**]) x2: Linear atelectasis at left lung base.
Emphysema. Comparison is made to the study from five hours
earlier. New left subclavian central venous line tip is in the
upper SVC. No pneumothorax is identified. Cardiac size,
mediastinal contours, and pulmonary vessels are within normal
limits.
.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2168-5-21**]): 1. Limited examination without
intravenous contrast. No intra-abdominal or pelvic fluid
collection or abscess. Normal appendix. Diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis.
2. Anterior wedging and superior endplate depression in the L3
vertebral body likely represents a compression deformity of
unknown chronicity. Clinical correlation is requested.
.
Echo ([**2166-10-31**]): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include anterior, lateral, and inferior
hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension/bacterial pneumonia. Low bp and lactate elevation
on presentation were concerning for sirs/sepsis physiology. Most
likely source was pulmonary given complaints of cough with
sputum production, though imaging not conclusive. Unlikely
abdominal source given negative CT. Urine culture was negative.
Patient was quickly weaned off levophed.  Of note, cortisol
showed no evidence of underlying adrenal insufficiency.  He
completed a 5 day course of high dose levofloxacin for treatment
and is stable on room air.
.
# Acute renal failure. Likely hypovolemia, resolved with IVF.
.
# CAD:  Patient has known 3 vessel CAD and has been referred for
CABG but does not follow-up.  Most recently he completed the
preop work-up at [**Hospital1 756**] but then did not follow through, per
his surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66293**], with the surgery.  He now states he
is finally ready to go through with the surgery given he is
scooter-bound due to his baseline dyspnea.  No evidence that
patient's hypotension was cardiac in origin.  ECHO shows
improved EF from prior and patient ruled out with serial
enzymes.  He reports stable exertional dyspnea which has not
recently changed.  He was thus referred back to his surgeon, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 66293**], to pursue CABG.  He was urged to avoid significant
exertion in the interim but is scooter-bound at baseline due to
his dyspnea.  He is on an ASA, statin, BB, and ACEI.
.
# Visual changes:
Patient described pre-syncope like visual changes (blacking out
of both eyes) in the setting of an extreme urge to pass a bowel
movement prior to admission with no recurrence of these symptoms
in house.  Given a history of carotid disease Carotid
ultrasounds were pursued and show 60-70% bilateral disease.  No
clear indication for surgical intervention at this time.
Patient instructed to follow-up with his primary if he develops
monocular vision loss or any TIA symptoms.  He was continued on
his ASA, plavix, and statin.
.
# PVD. No acute issues.  Outpatient follow-up.
.
# COPD.  Stable on room air.  Patient encouraged to take his
albuterol and atrovent inhalers.  Incentive spirometry was
reviewed and encouraged in anticipation of future surgery.  He
does not smoke.
.
# DM2: Patient covered with insulin in house but was restarted
on his home glyburide prior to discharge.
.
# Opthalmic. History of glaucoma and s/p right sided cataract
surgery.
- outpatient follow up.
.
# Anemia:  Labs unrevealing.  Needs continued work-up
outpatient.
.
# Hematuria:  Likely due to trauma from foley placed in ED.
Needs repeat urinalysis outpatient and cystoscopy if this
persists.
.
# Access: Left subclavian placed in ED for pressors
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
.
# Dispo: discharged to home
