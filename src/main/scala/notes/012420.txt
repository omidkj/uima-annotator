Service:  CARDIOTHOR

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old
female with a history of diabetes mellitus with a previous
hospitalization at an outside hospital with recurrent nausea
and vomiting.  This was associated with a fluttering in the
chest.  She was ruled out for an myocardial infarction.
Electrocardiogram was without significant changes and an
echocardiogram on that admission showed an ejection fraction
of 50% and mild mitral regurgitation.  Gastrointestinal, she
revealed gastroparesis.  She was discharged and ten days
later, was readmitted again for severe nausea and vomiting
and symptoms of pulmonary edema and fluttering in her chest.
An ETT thallium done during that admission revealed mild left
ventricular dilatation with stress and an ejection fraction
of 38%.  Imaging revealed a fixed apical defect along
anterior and along anterior wall.  Subsequent to that, she
was discharged.  An echocardiogram done on [**2133-2-24**]
showed an ejection fraction of 50%, no significant valve
disease and borderline pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Since the episode, she has had no similar symptoms.  Denies
any chest discomfort.  She has noticed though an increase in
dyspnea on exertion.  She must stop several times to rest
when walking short distances. She now presented to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further work-up.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes mellitus type
1, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroparesis.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a fifth toe
amputation on the right foot and teeth extraction.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking 21 years ago.  She
is single and works in computer operations.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.8.  Pulse 68.  Blood
pressure 154/54.  Respiratory rate 18, 98% on room air.
Glucose is 164.  Patient is alert and oriented times three in
no acute distress.  No jugular venous distention.  No bruits.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen is soft, nontender with normal abdominal bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No edema with good veins.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 6.5,
hematocrit of 34.2, platelets of 260,000.  Sodium 142,
potassium 4.8, chloride 102, bicarbonate of 31, BUN 23,
creatinine 1.0, INR 1.2.  Electrocardiogram shows sinus
rhythm at the rate of 66, nonspecific T wave changes in the
anterolateral leads.  The chest x-ray done on [**2133-2-4**]
showed evidence of slight congestive heart failure but no
pneumonia.  There was bilateral pleural effusions at the
bases.

Cardiac echocardiogram on [**2133-2-24**] significant for left
ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, otherwise, normal.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2133-2-26**].  This was significant for an ejection fraction of 40%.
Hypokinesis globally.  There is 80% stenosis of the right
coronary artery, 70% stenosis of the left anterior
descending, 90% stenosis of the OM1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.  The patient was taken to the
Operating Room where she underwent coronary artery bypass
graft times three.  The grafts were left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to
OM and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery.
She tolerated this procedure well.  She underwent an EPH
performed on the right thigh.  Patient was transferred to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit hemodynamically stable.
Patient was extubated without incident.  Patient was weaned
off all drips without incident.  Patient's chest tube output
decreased appropriately.  Patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Patient's diet was advanced as tolerated.

On postoperative day number one, the patient was seen by
[**Last Name (un) **] for better glucose control.  Patient was transferred
to the floor for the remainder of her recovery.

On postoperative day number two, patient's hematocrit was
found to be 20, down from 25.  She was transfused two units
of packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit remained stable at
29.  She otherwise remained hemodynamically stable.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 14810**]perative day number three and four, patient developed
some nausea with emesis.  The patient's nausea became
refractory to antiemetic therapy.  Due to her presentation
initially with nausea and vomiting, it was thought this might
be an anginal equivalent.  The patient was taken for an
emergency catheterization which was significant for left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending being
patent.  Saphenous vein graft to OM patent and vein to
posterior descending artery patent.  Patient tolerated this
procedure well.  Her nausea and emesis resolved over the next
ensuing days.  Patient has remained stable and has been
ambulating to a level five.  Patient is now ready for
discharge home with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four
weeks and patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her
primary care physician in two weeks.
