History of Present Illness:
88 F with hx HTN, HLD, and a recently discovered aortic
aneurysm, was last seen well by her daughter with whom she lives
at about 11:30 pm last night. This morning at about 4 am the
daughter awoke, and noticed a banging noise coming from the
bathroom. When she opened the door, she found her mother on the
floor, flailing her arm against a vanity. Her mother was
non-verbal and was just repeatedly moaning. She called EMS and
on their arrival she was noted to have vomited.

MICRO:
Blood Cx ([**6-3**], [**6-7**]): No growth x2
Urine Cx ([**6-7**]): No growth

IMAGING:
CXR ([**6-3**]): IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube 4.8 cm from the carina.
2. Enlarged calcified tortuous aorta and apparently widened
mediastinum.  Consider CT for further evaluation.

CT Head ([**6-3**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. MR is
more sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia.

CT C-Spine ([**6-3**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine, but severe
degenerative disease predisposes this patient to spinal cord
injury with minor trauma. In the appropriate clinical setting
(for example myelopathy), consider an MR for further evaluation.

2. Retrodental hyperdensity and calcification is likely
degenerative in origin. In the appropriate clinical context, an
MR for further evaluation is indicated.
3. Pulmonary edema.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is a small midline disk
protrusion at C3-4. This does not appear to contact the spinal
cord.

EEG ([**6-4**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy
states due to the widespread slowing over the left hemisphere.
This suggests a subcortical dysfunction on the left but cannot
specify the etiology. There were no clearly epileptiform
features.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] ([**6-4**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Acute stroke in the left lentiform nucleus and left internal
capsule, corresponding to the territory of left lenticulostriate
artery and left distal M2 and M3 segment.

CXR ([**6-4**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**6-3**], the
endotracheal tube has been removed. The nasogastric tube is also
no longer present. The cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits and there is no change in the appearance of the calcified
and tortuous aorta. Widening of the mediastinum suggested on the
previous study is not appreciated at this time. There is mild
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. No evidence of vascular
congestion or pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia.

Carotid Ultrasound ([**6-4**]): Impression:
Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis 40-59%.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] ([**6-6**]): CONCLUSION: Severely limited study due to a
combination of thoracic kyphosis lifting the cervical spine far
from the surface coil, and motion artifact.  Severely limited
sensitivity for detecting ligamentous injury. No such injuries
are identified on this examination. Similarly, severely limited
sensitivity for detecting spinal cord signal intensity
abnormalities, although no such abnormalities are seen.
Degenerative disc disease with spinal canal narrowing at C3-4
and [**5-2**], again poorly characterized.

ECG ([**6-7**]): The rhythm is probably sinus rhythm with atrial
premature beats at a rate of 75. Non-specific anterolateral ST-T
wave changes. No previous tracing available for comparison

CXR ([**6-7**]): IMPRESSION:
Stable left basilar airspace opacity and new small left pleural
effusion, which may be attributed to developing pneumonia.
Aspiration is thought to be less likely given the persistence of
the opacity over several days.

TTE ([**6-8**]): The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or
saline contrast (at rest only; patient unable to perform
maneuvers). There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>60%). There is a mild resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
No cardiac source of embolus identified.

Video Swallow ([**6-9**]): IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe
oropharyngeal dysphagia with penetration and silent aspiration
with all barium consistencies. For further details, please refer
to the speech and swallow pathologist's note of the same day.

Abdomen Film ([**6-14**]): IMPRESSION: Moderate amount of stool
throughout the colon. No evidence of obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 88 year old woman with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and 40 pack year smoking history
who presented after being found down. Physical exam on admission
showed she was intubated, moves LUE and LLE
