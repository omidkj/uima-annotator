61 year old man with CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? infiltrate
STUDY: AP CHEST, [**2158-3-5**].

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus in the body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary
veins not identified.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Mild symmetric LVH. Top
normal/borderline dilated LV cavity size. Moderately depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Borderline normal RV
systolic function.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). AVR
leaflets move normally. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move
normally. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST:
Prosthetic valve in aortic position.
Well seated and mechanically stable.
No appreciable gradient.
Improved biventricular systolci function


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2-20**] he underwent redo-sternotomy and AVR. He was transferred
to the ICU in stable condition on epi, neo and propofol. He was
extubated the morning of POD #1 secondary to agitation. He was
started on coumadin for his mechanical valve. He was transferred
to the floor on POD #1. His white count remained elevated and he
was pancultured and started on azithromycin for ? of
bronchitis/pneumonia. He became confused and on [**2-25**] a code
purple was called. He was started on ativan. Neurology was
called and a head CT which showed nothing acute was obtained. He
was started on IV thiamine. He continued to be confused at times
and on [**2-27**] overnight another code purple was called. A
psychiatry consult was called, ativan was tapered and haldol was
started. He began to clear, and was weaned from his haldol. He
awaited placement, and was ready for discharge home on POD #14.

Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] office who has agreed to manage his
coumadin.
