Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain
mental status change

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
89 F with pmhx afib, CVA x 2, dementia, hypothyroidism who was
originally admitted [**2-21**] to the SICU after noting abdominal pain
x 4d and decreased responsiveness. In the SICU she was found to
have have thrombus in L atrium, left renal artery, and SMA.
Radiographic L renal infarction, but bowel "looked good, no sign
peritonitis."
.
She was managed conservatively given lactate was relatively low
and interpreted as no evidence of mesenteric ischemia, with NGT,
heparin gtt, and pain control. Decision was made by family and
pt not to pursue aggressive intervention.
.
Pt was started on anticoagulation and empiric antibiotics and
was going to be transferred to the medicine floor when she was
noted to be anuric and unresponsive to verbal stimuli. [**2-21**]
ABG=7.5/28/100. Per report, this family was called to discuss
goals of care. They essentially do not want anything aggressive
done including further scans and want her to be comfortable but
did not want to completely withdraw care at this time.
.
Pt transferred from MICU service to medical service for ongoing
management of SMA infarction, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**], mental status changes
felt likely [**3-7**] repeat CVA, and ?PNA (on levaquin/flagyl for
PNA, not for abdominal process per MICU team)

Past Medical History:
1. CVA - x 2, most recently [**4-10**].
2. Atrial fibrillation, on coumadin.
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. Hypothyroidism
5. Dementia - per daughter at baseline pt is able to converse.


Social History:
Emigrated from [**Country 3587**]. Lives with her daughter. Smokes a
pipe every month. No etoh/drugs. Occasionally attends an elder
day care program. Daughter works during the day so patient is
occasionally unsupervised.


Family History:
No history of stroke, diabetes, coronary artery disease.

STUDIES:
* [**2-20**] CT abd/pelvis: Thrombus in the left atrium. Thrombosis of
the proximal superior mesenteric artery with distal
reconstitution probably through collateral flow. No evidence of
small or large bowel wall thickening or adjacent inflammatory
change to suggest ischemia. Thrombosis of the left renal artery
and associated infarction of the left kidney. Wedge compression
deformities of L1 and L3 are probably chronic.
* [**2-20**] CXR: NG tube in good position. Stable cardiomegaly, mild
left lower lobe atelectasis. No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
* [**2-20**] Head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
Overall similar appearance of the brain compared to [**2188-10-19**] with
multiple areas of old infarction demonstrated. Please note that
MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3631**]-weighted imaging is more sensitive for
evaluation of acute infarction if this is a significant clinical
concern.


Brief Hospital Course:
a/p:  89 yo female with afib, CVA x2, dementia, now with SMA
clot, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**], non-enhancing kidney on CT and anuria with
unresponsiveness.
.
# abdominal pain/hypotension - pt admitted to the surgical
service, and found to have thrombus in left renal artery (with
complete left renal infarction), and superior mesenteric artery.
 She had radiographic L renal infarction.  serial lactates were
trending down, and pt was without peritonitis.  She was treated
conservatively with antibiotics and NGT decompression and
heparin gtt.  she was not felt to require surgical intervention.
 her abdominal pain resolved.  She was awaiting transfer to the
medical service when her mental status acutely declined as
below.
.
# Altered mental status: Per family, patient's mental status has
been declining ever since her last CVA.  Admission CT HEAD
showed no acute bleeding, but could not exclude embolic event.
She has known clot in SMA, left renal artery and LEFT atrial
thrombus (seen on CT superior cuts of CT abd/pelvis) despite
anticoagulation with coumadin.  She was placed on heparin during
this hospitalization for concern for SMA and renal artery
thrombosis.  However on [**2-22**] pt's mental status acute declined.
She was no longer able to communicate reliable.  Concern was for
recurrent stroke given her history of atrial fibrillation and
left atrial thrombus as above, in spite of heparin
anticoagulation.  Given her acute mental status decline, despite
anticoagulation, decision was made with family to change goals
of care to DNR/DNI.  Pt's mental status failed to improve after
transfer to the MICU, and given goals of care did not include
BIPAP or invasive lines or procedures, she was [**Last Name (un) 4662**] to the
medical floor.  Her mental status remained poor.  She was
continued on empiric antibiotics for concern for PNA, though CXR
was unremarkable.
.
On [**2-23**], mental status had failed to improve.  After extensive
discussion with both pt's HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12149**] and her
son [**Name (NI) 12150**] [**Name2 (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12151**], decision was made to change
goals of care to comfort measures only, as it was felt that she
had likely suffered a recurrent stroke in spite of heparin
anticoagulation.  Family clearly did not desire PEG tube
placement, and agree that further anticoagulation would not
likely alter her prognosis.  Her coumadin was discontinued.  Her
urine out
