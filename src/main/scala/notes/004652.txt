Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Rib fractures and hemothorax.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2177-1-31**]:
1. Right thoracotomy and evacuation of hemothorax.
2. Rib plating, multiple ribs (5).
3. Primary repair of diaphragmatic laceration.
4. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3123**] is an 87 year old Caucasian male with history of [**1-16**]
falls first starting 7 weeks ago per patient, although he was
slightly confused during interview. The falls occured while
going to the restroom at night, preceded by dizziness and a fall
while micturating. He suffered per pt report 2 rib fxrs 7 weeks
ago, was hospitalized for a short time, to rehab, to home then
fell
again five weeks ago, then again ? 2 weeks ago. Records reveal
an admission with discharge [**1-23**] for COPD exacerbation with
right sided rib fractures. He completed levaquin and steroids,
and was readmitted [**1-26**] for cough and WBC 36,000- + ecoli UTI
and staph oxacillin sensitive pneumonia. He was started on
doxycyline, zosyn. He was also noted to have ileus by KUB. CT
done [**1-27**]
revealed a right moderate to severe right effusion and R [**2-21**]
rib fractures. Thoracentesis was done without success, therefore
this was thought to be a right hemothorax. He was transferred
from [**Hospital1 1562**] arrived [**2177-1-29**] at 730pm. Of note he required a
unit of blood per notes to maintain hct around 30 on the
outside.  The patient's main symptoms are right sided pain,
shortness of
breath and 2 week constipation.

CXR:
[**2177-2-9**]: FINDINGS: There is a prominent hiatal hernia. There
has been priorthoracotomy with rib plating identified. There are
pleural parenchymal
changes seen at the lung bases. Aside from this, no definite
consolidation is seen.
[**2177-1-30**]: Large right pleural effusion, largely predominantly
layering, with associated atelectasis, as on the recent OSH CT.
N.B. That study demonstrates several significantly displaced
posterolateral right rib fractures and the effusion measures up
to 30 [**Doctor Last Name **] in attenuation and may represent an organizing
hemothorax, related to trauma. No pneumothorax is identified on
that study.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal IVC diameter (<2.1cm)
with >55% decrease during respiration (estimated RA pressure
(0-5mmHg).
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. No MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>65%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.1cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3123**] was transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on the night
of [**2177-1-29**] with a right hemothorax and a flail chest from
multiple rib fractures. Hospital Day 1 pre-operative work-up was
done.  On [**2177-1-31**] he was taken to the operating room for
Right thoracotomy and evacuation of hemothorax. Rib plating,
multiple ribs (5).
Primary repair of diaphragmatic laceration and Bronchoscopy with
bronchoalveolar lavage.  He was transferred to the ICU
postoperative intubated and postoperative hypotension.
Postoperative day 1 he was successfully extubated. He was
started on a ketamine and midazolam drip for better pain
control. He still remained hypotensive requiring placement of a
right internal jugular TLC for continued pressor support. On
[**2177-2-2**] following transfusion of 1 unit of PRBC.  The ketamine
and midazolm drip were discontinued. He was started on Dilaudid
PO/IV with good pain control. On [**2177-2-4**] he still required
low-dose pressors.  An echocardiogram revealed moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.1cm2). Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. On [**2177-2-5**] he was transfused 2
units of PRBCs and was able to wean off pressors.  He continued
to do well aggressive pulmonary toilet, mucolytic nebs and
transferred to the floor on [**2177-2-6**].

Respiratory: aggressive incentive spirometer, mucolytic nebs,
chest PT, and pain control his oxygen requirements improved to
95% on 2L.  He had a persistent cough which tesselon pearls and
guaifensin cough suppressants were started with some
improvement.
