Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred for hypoxia and bronchoscopy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
pulmonary artery catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
68 y/o male with a history of angioimmunoblastic T cell Lymphoma
s/p 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy diagnosed in [**2144-9-23**] on [**6-9**] with increasing hypoxia
(90% on RA), orthopnea, decreasing appetite, increasing weakness
and increasing abdominal girth.  He was thought to be in
decompensated CHF with pulmonary edema and ascites and underwent
aggressive diuresis with no improvement in his symptoms. On
admission he was started on azithromycin and ceftriaxone for
community acquired pneumonia.  Per report he was not febrile
thru out his hospital stay. He was evaluated by infectious
disease given his lack of improvment who recommended vancomycin
for MRSA infection, bactrim for PCP pna, cefepime for GN
coverage, and gatifloxacin for atypical pna.  HIs WBC trended
downward however his oxygen requirment continued to increase.

He underwent CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which demonstrated
extensive hilar, mediastinal, retroperitoneal, iliac and
inguinal adenopathy. A 2.5 cm left perihilar mass and and 8 mm
nodule in  left lung near the descending aorta.  Right sided
pleural effusion.  Small bilateral renal calculi with no
obstructive changes. He underwent CT neck which revealed stable
LN dz in neck, and LN enlargement in mediastinum

He underwent echo with normal EF and was evaluated by cardiology
who felt his symptoms were consistent with CHF.

His hospital course was complicated by the development of acute
renal failure with a Cr of 4.6 and agitation requiring haldol.
And supratherapeutic INR.

Worsening of his rapid afib with RVR to the 140s for which he
was started on diltiazem.  There were also rate related ST
depressions reported.

He underwent diagnostic paracentesis which revealed atypical
cells on cytology and WBC 14,030,  RBC 38,000, with 41%
Neutropil concerning for SBP.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for bronch.

Radiologic Studies:

CXR [**6-17**]: There are diffuse bilateral opacities and this is a
cardiomegaly, consistent with CHF. However, a multifocal
pneumonia cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 y/o male with progressive pulmonary decline unresponsive to
diuresis and broad spectrum antibiotics and new onset of ascites
concerning for rapidly progressive metastatic lymphoma and new
acute renal failure. Intubated emergently for refractory
hypoxemia on [**6-17**] w/prolonged ICU stay c/b vent-assoc MRSA PNA,
periods of rapid Afib, drug rash, and diffuculty weaning off
ventilator.
.
# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/SIRS: Emergently intubated on
admission to the ICU for refractory hypoxemia. The cause of his
respiratory failure was unclear. However, infectious etiology
was felt to be high given his immunosuppressed state from his
T-cell lymphoma. He was covered broadly with ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, bactrim, vancomycin, and voriconazole. Was on
Vanco/CTX/Azithro/Vori x 14 days([**Date range (1) 62192**]), on Zosyn for
increased fever and secretions, 7 day course ([**7-1**]- [**7-8**]).
Bronchoscopy/BAL was performed and was negative for AFB, PCP or
bacterial microorganisms. Induced sputum was also negative. He
was continued empirically on antibiotics given his clinical
decline with sepsis physiology. Tumor burden with lymphangitic
spread was also considered as a potential etiology of his
respiratory distress, but was felt less likely given the stable
appearance of his tumor on imaging studies. CTA was negative for
PE as a potential source. He had a tracheotomy tube placed on
[**7-14**] and was slowly weaned off the ventilator.  Weaning was
complicated by large amount of bleeding from tracheostomy while
on heparin and by large amounts of secretions leading to mucous
plugging.  Heparin was d/ced [**2-24**] to bleeding from tracheostomy.
Course was further complicated by MRSA tracheobronchitis treated
with Vancomycin ([**7-20**]-expected [**7-29**] to complete 10 day course).
He improved greatly with decreased secretions with Vancomycin.
Recent speech consult for passey muir valve, patient was able to
tolerate for short periods of time (approximately 30 seconds [**2-24**]
secretions) - currently able to tolerate longer periods of time.
 Currently patient with O2 sats @ 100% on 60% face mask.
Current respiratory treatments include Vancomycin 1gm q12hr (day
[**9-1**]), Albuterol q 6hr. It is hoped that in the next week or so
he will have the trach removed and return to breathing from his
oral airway.
.
# Hypotension: Hypotension felt to be septic in etiology given
its distributive nature. SVR was found to be low, in 500's, by
pulmonary artery cath, with normal cardiac output. He was
treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as outlined above. In
addition he was started on pressors with neosynephrine. However,
he remained persistently hypotensive, with decreasing SVR's.
Therefore vasopressin was added to his regimen. Subsequently his
MAP's increased >60 with steady UOP >30 cc/hr. He was also noted
to have initial evidence of low-grade DIC with increasing
PT/PTT, and decreasing fibrinogen
