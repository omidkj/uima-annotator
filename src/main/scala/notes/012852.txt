Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Tongue laceration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement
Teeth Extraction, OMFS
TEE, Cardiology


History of Present Illness:
43 yo male with a history of anoxic brain injury living at a
Radius, who is trach and PEG dependent, who presents from his
rehabilitation facility with a tongue laceration.  Patient is
s/p brain injury after a PEA event following a VT ablation
procedure in the EP lab here at [**Hospital1 **] and is vent dependent.  He
was seen by ENT in the ED, who said he can have an out-patient
elective procedure if his family elects to repair the tongue,
which is forked. VS were T 96, BP 132/80, HR 79, 100% on vent on
100% O2.


Past Medical History:
Diabetes
Dyslipidemia
Hypertension
s/p STEMI [**6-/2193**], w/ large thrombus in the proximal LAD
complicated
by cardiogenic shock w/ DES to prox LAD
[**11/2193**]: [**Month/Year (2) 3941**] placement for Low EF, runs of NSVT.
h/o alcohol and substance abuse
h/o deep vein thrombosis partially treated with Coumadin
positive hepatitis B serologies in the past
s/p PEA arrest in [**9-/2202**] with resulting anoxic brain injury
during VT ablation in EP lab. at baseline, the pt is responsive
only to deep painful stim (such as deep suctioning), although he
does appear alert and open his eyes (no tracking). He is
completely dependent for all ADLs.

Social History:
He had been on disability for 10 years since his first heart
attack. Prior to that he was a manager at [**Company **]'s.  He
reported smoking approximately one pack of cigarettes per week.
He also reported history of ETOH but denied any IVDA. Now
unresponsive to all but deep painful stim, and completely
dependent for all ADLs.

Family History:
non-contributory.
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
VS on arrival to the floor: T 98.7, HR 93, BP 127/75, 100% trach
with BIPAP  [**4-6**] rate 31

Cardio: RR, II/VI SEM at USB B/L, no r/g
Abd: + BS, PEG; somewhat distended and firm though no rebound or
guarding, no fluid wave or HSM appreciated
Extremities: [**12-4**]+ [**Location (un) **] right slightly greater than left but
fairly symmetric, no erythema or TTP; arms somewhat contracted
though mobile; right PIV
Skin: no ecchymoses; no evidnece of trauma

[**11-20**] EEG - This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of a low voltage background rhythm. This finding
is
consistent with a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Medications,
toxic/metabolic, infection, and anoxia are common causes. No
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are seen
during this
recording. Note is made of a bifid p wave in a single EKG
channel.
.
[**11-20**] KUB - There is relative paucity of the bowel gas with the
bowel loops centered in the mid lower abdomen. There is no
evidence of bowel dilatation.There is no evidence of extensive
amount of stool within the colon. The gastrostomy is projecting
over the left upper quadrant.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present.
.
[**11-20**] LUE US - Left brachial vein thrombus with questionable
minimal flow around it, new since prior exam from [**2202-9-29**].
.
[**11-23**] TEE - No valvular or pacemaker associated vegetations
seen. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (leaflets do
not coapt). Severely depressed left ventricular systolic
function.
.
[**11-23**] RUQ US - 1. Contracted gallbladder without stones. No
son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence for cholecystitis or significant biliary
ductal dilatation.
2. Equivocal nodularity to the hepatic contour may suggest
underlying chronic liver disease.
.
[**11-25**] CT neck w. and without contrast -1. No obvious large focus
of abnormal enhancement rim-enhancing lesions to suggest
abscess. 2. Obliteration of the oropharynx secondary to
apposition of nasopharyngeal
soft tissues, the soft palate and the base of the tongue. 3.
Prominence of hypopharyngeal and nasopharyngeal soft tissues,
which requires clinical correlation with direct ENT examination.
4. Thickening of palatine tonsils, right greater than left,
which require clinical correlation by direct ENT examination. 5.
Mildly enlarged level IIa lymph node, most likely reactive, less
likely infective. 6. Changes in the lung apex- likely pleural-
consider dedicated chest imaging, if not performed earlier.
.
[**11-25**] CXR: The cardiomegaly is unchanged. The left retrocardiac
opacity has increased in the interim slightly, but it might be
associated with interval development of mild interstitial
pulmonary edema that contributes to worsening of the left basal
opacity. The tracheostomy and the pacemaker leads are in
unchanged position. The left costophrenic angle was not included
in the field of view.


Brief Hospital Course:
43yoM with anoxic brain injury, s/p PEG & trach, after a PEA
arrest on the EP table in [**9-/2202**] (pt was undergoing VT
ablation); admitted with stable tongue laceration (1 week old)
from biting tongue, found to be bacteremic with MRSA.
.
#. TONGUE LACERATION: The laceration was covered with
granulation tissue, no purulence/erythema, and ENT (who was
consulted in the ED) thought no urgent intervention was
required. On talking to the patient??????s sister and mother further,
it seems that the patient??????s tongue biting occurred
intermittently for the week or two prior to admission, when he
was on medication ??????to bring down his K??????. He underwent CT neck
w/contrast to evaluate for an irritative focus (no abnormality
was seen).  He then bit off more tongue on [**11-25**], OMFS was
consulted, and pulled 2 loose teeth that were thought to be the
culprit.  Finally on [**11-28**] the pt underwent total teeth
extraction. He will need an out-pt appointment with ENT if
family elects to have tongue fixed for cosmetic purposes.
.
# MRSA Bacteremia:  High grade bacteremia with 6/6 bottles
positive on [**11-20**], negative cultures since then. The patient
will need a 4 week course of Vanc 1g q12h, ending on [**12-19**], and
will need Vanc level, BUN, Cr weekly until then. Additionally,
the patient will be treated with possible VAP with
Cefepime/Cipro (Day 1 = [**11-24**], 7 day course will end on [**12-12**]).
TEE did not show vegetations or involvement of [**Month/Year (2) 3941**]; per ID recs,
will keep cardiac hardware in place for now.
.
# Aspiration PNA:  Resolved. Sputum cx c/w aspiration pna, pt
noted to also have secretions and suspect high aspiration risk.
Sputum growing respiratory flo
