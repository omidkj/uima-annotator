CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: spinal/vascular injury?
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
20 year old man s/p GSW to left lower flank, no exit wound, cant
feel or move below knees bilaterally - vital signs stable, gcs
15
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
spinal/vascular injury?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT TORSO PERFORMED ON [**2182-4-24**].

IMPRESSION:

Gunshot wound to the abdomen with injuries to the descending
colon, bilateral psoas muscles, spinal cord (L3-4 level)
inferior pole of the right kidney, and segment VI of the liver.
Active extravasation of urine is noted on delayed imaging,
though no evidence of active bleeding. Bullet is noted lodged in
the liver in segment VI.

MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2182-4-25**] 1:14 AM

IMPRESSION: Status post abdominal and lumbar gunshot injuries as
described above. There is evidence of heterogeneous signal
intensity in the filum terminale at the level of L3/L4 likely
consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage and multiple bone
fragments within the spinal canal. There is no evidence of
epidural hematoma or significant narrowing of the spinal canal.

At L2/L3, there is evidence of right paraspinal gunshot injury
involving the right psoas muscle with extension at the level of
the corresponding right neural foramen with possible lesion
along the nerve root and the dorsal root ganglion at L2 nerve
root, please correlate clinically. Similar findings are observed
at L3 on the left side. Free fluid is observed in the abdominal
cavity as described in the prior CT of the abdomen.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2182-4-28**] 9:55 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple dilated loops of jejunum with air fluid levels and
wall thickening, ileal decompression. Findigs are c/w SBO.
2. Liver and right renal lacerations stable, no hematoma no
assocted adjacent fluid.
3. Tiny amount of fluid seen within the left paracolic gutter
and right perirenal space.
4. Foci of free air within the abdomen and pelvis likely due to
recent surgery.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and taken directly to the
operating room for
exploratory laparotomy, primary repair of left colon colotomy
x2, exploration of retroperitoneum, right and left and
evaluation of hepatic through-and-through gunshot wound with
drainage. There were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained
sedated and intubated. On [**2182-4-25**] he was taken back to the
operating room for placement of an inferior vena cava filter.

He was eventually weaned and extubated and was later transferred
to the regular nursing unit. He developed an ileus; an NG tube
was placed, his output was high initially. The NG tube remained
in place for several days. A PICC line was placed in preparation
for possible TPN. A CT of the abdomen was performed to rule out
intra-abdominal fluid collection; none was identified. Bowel
function did eventually return and the NG tube was removed. His
diet was advanced slowly and he is currently tolerating a
regular diet. The PICC line was removed.

Orthopedic Spine surgery was consulted for his spine injury;
this was non operative.
He was evaluated by Physical therapy and was strongly
recommended for [**Hospital **] rehab post acute hospitalization. He has
slowly begun to have intermittent sensation in both lower
extremities.

Psychiatry was also consulted because patient began to have
nightmares of the events surrounding the trauma. It was
recommended to try Clonidine 0.1 mg qhs to treat the nightmares
and insomnia and to titrate up as needed. Because at the time he
was NPO he was started on Clonidine 0.1 mg patch. His overall
mood and mental status have improved significantly; he is more
engaging and participatory with his care; he even appears to be
more optimistic regarding the progress that he has made so far.
There have been no behavioral problems.

Social work has also been following closely with patient and his
family for emotional support. The Center for Violence Prevention
& Recovery were also consulted; providing information on
victim's compensation and counseling post hospitalization.

He does continue to have pain control issues; initially he was
on PCA and was later changed to oral Dilaudid with IV for
breakthrough pain. The Dilaudid was later changed to Oxycodone
prn. His current regimen appears to be more effective.

He developed a UTI and was treated with Cipro course. He does
have an indwelling Foley catheter and this was changed.

He continues to work with PT & OT and had made some progress; he
will clearly benefit from a [**Hospital **] rehab post acute hospital stay.
