EAST HOSPITAL MEDICINE ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE

Date: [**2188-4-5**]
Time: 21:15

The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]yo [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] resident PMHx vascular
dementia, chronic dCHF p/w cough and hypoxia. Per report, on day
of admission, patient was found to be short of breath, febrile
to 100.7, with O2 sat of 69% on room air.  On exam patient had
thick yellow secretions.  She was placed on 2LNC and saturation
improved to 91%. Patient was started on nebs, and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] via EMS.

On presentation to the ED, her vitals were 85 24 99%RA. Exam
with sparse crackles. EKG was unchanged from prior.  Labs were
remarkable for WBC 4.5 (58%N), Hct 44.4, lactate 1.1, BNP2677,
trop.02. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy opacities. Patient
was given CTX, azithromycin, vancomycin, for HCAP+CAP, as well
as solumedrol for possible COPD exacerbation.  ED course was
notable for desaturation to 79% on 3L; patient was attempted on
BIPAP but reportedly did not tolerate.  On admission, vitals
were 98.4 118/87 94 18 98%neb.

On arrival to the ICU vital signs were T98.4, HR90, BP123/69,
satting 100% on NRB. She was lethargic on exam, arousable to
voice. She was not able to complete a review of systems. In the
ICU, she was extubated on [**4-3**], she was given IVIg 60gm IV daily
for two days (5d equivalent). Her fluid status was unclear, but
at transfer to medicine floor it was thought she was euvolemic.

IMAGING STUDIES:
.
[**2188-3-31**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Moderate left pleural effusion and
left lower lobe atelectasis or worsening. Moderate cardiomegaly
slightly larger today than on [**4-24**], stable since [**3-29**],
when mild pulmonary edema, subsequently resolved, was stable.
The pulmonary and hilar vascular engorgement have also improved.
ET tube in standard placement. Right subclavian line ends in the
upper SVC and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and
out of view. Calcifications and contour of the thoracic aorta
suggest aneurysm is present but difficult to assess on this
radiograph alone. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**2188-4-14**]: Chest (Portable)
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. No pneumonia. Small lung volumes. Moderate fluid
overload. The
presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The nasogastric
tube has been removed in the interval, the PICC line has been
slightly
advanced, the tip now projects over the lower SVC. No evidence
of
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:

IMPRESSION: [**Age over 90 **]F with PMH significant for dementia, chronic
diastolic CHF presenting with cough, lethargy and evidence of
acute hypercarbic-hypoxic respiratory distress requiring
intubation, initially thought to be neuromuscular in origin with
potentiating URI, on IVIG, s/p extubation and transfer to
medicine floor.

##. Acute respiratory failure/Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart
Failure - The patient was initially intubated given concerns for
neuromuscular respiratory failure given a prior diagnoses of at
least partial ptosis and a positive anti-cholinesterase antibody
on outpatient laboratory studies. She was evaluated by Neurology
and trialed on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy (pyridostigmine)
with IVIG infusion with minimal improvement in her NIFs and
respiratory status. She was also diuresed with Lasix to promote
a negative fluid balance and she showed no signs of infectious
concerns. Cultures remained reassuring. She tolerated
intermittent transition to pressure support ventilation but
overall failed to show marked improvement and tracheostomy was
considered. After discussion with her family members, it was
noted that long-term ventilatory support would not be something
she would have wanted, and thus a plan for extubation was
employed. On [**2188-4-3**], she was successfully extubated and was
weaned to an oxygen facemask and then nasal cannula for
supplemental oxygen.  She initially required 3-5 liters of O2 to
maintain SaO2 94% on the medicine floor, but was weaned to room
air successfully.  She will complete a pyridostigmine taper.
She remains on PO Lasix at this time, slightly reduced from her
home dose and has remained on room air, appears euvolemic,
without evidence of pulm edema.  Her current dose is 40mg po
daily, previously had been on 60mg po daily at home.  Given
recent decreased PO intake, would continue t
