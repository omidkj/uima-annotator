RUQ U/S [**9-27**]: 1. Echogenic liver, commonly seen in hepatic
steatosis. However, other forms of liver disease and more
advanced liver disease, including significant hepatic cirrhosis
and fibrosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this study. 2.
Ascites. 3. Normal appearance of gallbladder.

CT C/A/P [**9-27**]: 1. Interval development of moderate-to-large
abdominal ascites. 2. Tiny filling defect in the subsegmental
branches of the posterior segment of the left lower lobe,
compatible with acute PE.
3. Left greater than right basal patchy opacities, as well as
bronchial wall thickening and minimal post-inflammatory,
bronchiectasis, persistent in changes since the prior study,
mean reflect recurrent aspiration, infectious causes are also in
the differential. 4. Fatty liver. Limited evaluation for focal
liver lesions. Questionable focus of increased attenuation in
the posterior right lower lobe, as there is clinical concern;
MRI with gadolinium could be performed. 5. 13 mm nodular density
in the lingula, 3 months follow up is recommended.

TTE [**9-28**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity appears moderately dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved systolic function. Probable right ventricular dilation
with borderline normal function. Compared with the report of the
prior study (images unavailable for review) of [**2153-1-12**], the
right ventricle now appears dilated with low-normal function.

LENIs [**9-28**]: FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of
both lower extremities including the common femoral, superficial
femoral, and popliteal veins demonstrate normal flow,
augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms without evidence
for intraluminal thrombus. IMPRESSION: No DVT in either lower
extremity.

CT Chest [**9-30**]: 1. Increased moderate bilateral pleural effusion
with bibasilar alveolar opacities, mostly on the left,
atelectasis versus pneumonia. 2. Mild bibasilar areas of
bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening suggest
peribronchial inflammation. 3. Lingular atelectasis without
suspicious lesion for neoplasia. 4. Severe fatty liver and
ascites. 5. Bilateral gynecomastia.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M w h/o alcoholism, hyperlipidemia, COPD and afib p/w
watery diarrhea, jaundice and increasing SOB admitted to MICU,
then called out to medical floor.
.
1) Diarrhea: Initially with 10-15 watery bowel movements/day.
Although pt initially described some blood to the BMs, he later
stated that he only rarely noticed small amounts of red blood
upon wiping with toilet paper and not in the stool itself.
Stools studies for E.Coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter,
and C diff were negative. O&P tests were also negative. There
was evidence of cecal to ascending bowel wall thickening on his
admission CT abd/pelvis but this was in the setting of no
accompanying abdominal pain and an unimpressive lactate thus
making an embolic or frank ischemic colitis less likely. It was
thought that the diarrhea was likely viral in nature, which then
preciptated low BPs in a gentleman on multiple BP agents (SBP
noted to drop as low at 60s in MICU while p
