lung cancer
- Brain MRI [**5-14**]: ring-enhancing mass lesion on the left
occipital lobe; lesion associated with vasogenic edema; no
significant midline shift demonstrated.  Mild mass effect is
noted on the left occipital ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**]

Imaging:
.
CT Chest [**4-23**]: this was a screening high res CT scan (part of
clinical trial and showed a 4x4 left hilar mass.
.
- CT Brain at OSH showed left parietal lesion
.
- Brain MRI [**5-14**]: ring-enhancing mass lesion on the left
occipital lobe; lesion associated with vasogenic edema; no
significant midline shift demonstrated.  Mild mass effect is
noted on the left occipital ventricular [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
.
- CT Abd/Pelvis [**5-15**]: Numerous hepatic metastases involving all
lobes of the liver. Lytic lesion within the left femoral head
and left acetabulum
Echo: ([**5-13**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral akinesis, inferior and inferoseptal hypokinesis.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. No major valvular abnormalities seen.
Bilateral pleural effusions. Technically-difficult study.
.
EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is a moderately abnormal EEG due to the
presence of a  slow background with multifocal slow transients;
this pattern is most consistent with a mild to moderate
encephalopathy or other process involving both hemispheres
equally. No epileptiform features were seen.
.
Pathology:
Tissue specimen: (Lung)
Left main bronchus, endobronchial biopsy:

Poorly differentiated carcinoma, consistent with small cell
carcinoma; see note.

Note:  By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells are positive for
cytokeratin cocktail, TTF-1, synaptophysin and chromogranin.
Focal, faint staining by cytokeratin 7 is identified. The tumor
cells are negative for cytokeratin 20 and leukocyte common
antigen, with satisfactory controls. This immunophenotype
supports the above diagnosis.

[**2120-5-21**] NON-CONTRAST CHEST CT:
1. Large left sided pleural effusion.
2. Small right sided pleural effusion.
3. Large left hilar mass with resultant bronchial obstruction.
Confluent
liver metastases.
4. Large right paratracheal lymph node with mass effect on the
SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 66 yo man with newly, incidentally diagnosed SCLC
with metastases to the liver, bones, and brain, who was admitted
on [**2120-5-13**] for AMS attributed to worsening encephalopathy.  He
was started on Keppra for seziure prophylaxis, as well as
dexamethasone; XRT was deferred this admission due to his
tenuous overall status.  On [**2120-5-17**] he began a three-day course
of carboplatin/etopiside chemotherapy.

On [**2120-5-19**], he developed worsening mental status and was
intubated for hypoxemia.  He was treated with levofloxacin and
metronidazole to cover CAP or possible postobstructive PNA.  He
also required pressor support with phenylephrine, as well IVF.
Repeat chest CT was performed on [**2120-5-21**], which showed a new,
left-sided loculated effusion, as well as possible increase in
the size of the tumors in his chest.  There was also concern for
compression of the SVC by a large right paratracheal lymph node,
likley contributing to his hypotension and pressor-dependence.

On [**2120-5-22**], the patient's sedation was lightened and the decision
to withdrawal the ET tube was made after a conversation with the
patient and his family (wife and four children).  It was felt he
was fully competent to make the decision to become CMO, and the
family felt this would be consistent with his prior wishes given
the progression of the tumor and its effects.  The ET tube was
removed in the early afternoon and he was placed on a morphine
drip.  He had several hours of consciousness where he was able
to talk to his family at the bedside before he passed away in
the early morning on [**2120-5-23**].
