Brief Hospital Course:
A 61 yo woman with CRI, WPW s/p 3 mechanical valves, cirrhosis
thought to be cardiac in etiology, presents with acute on
chronic renal failure and ascites.
.
# Renal failure: Creatinine rose from 2.8 to 5.9 in the month
prior to admission. Exam was consistent with anasarca and volume
overload of 20-30 liters.  The likely contributing factors were
felt to be  poor forward flow (from cardiac failure and from
overdiuresis) with possibly a lesser component of hepatorenal
syndrome. Urinalysis and smear for eosinophils was negative, the
sediment was bland, and there was  trivial protein in the urine.
 Albumin was given initially, but renal failure persisted and
continued to worsen. Diuretics were held.  Plans were made for
dialysis.  Given that she was s
