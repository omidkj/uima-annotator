Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
left BKA sore, malaise, n/v

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 63 yo M w/DM2, s/p left BKA, h/o multiple
episodes of cellulitis now with a non-healing LBKA sore x 3
weeks. He was started on Keflex with intial improvement, but he
became more lethargic and developed malaise, body aches, n/v,
and intractable hiccups. On a f/u visit to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 25194**]
was noted and he was sent to the ED.
.
Patient has been non-compliant with his Diabetes medications FS
x 1 month. No h/o previous admissions for DKA.

He has had recurrent episodes of cellulitis of his LBKA in the
past which have always responded to Keflex.

.
At presentation to the ED, his vitals were 100.2, 102, 157/72,
94%/RA. He then spiked to 101.2. Labs were significant for DKA
with BS ~580, AG ~20. He was given 1 L of NS and started on
Insulin gtt. He was also found to have elevated Creatinine to
4.8 (baseline unknown). His CE's were elevated with CK of 580
and Trop-T of 0.1 but did not experience chest pain. His EKG
showed LVH with ST dep in lateral I, aVL, V4-6. He was started
on Heparin gtt, given lopressor, ASA. His CXray showed right
upper lobe opacity and was given Levoflox. He was given one dose
of Vanc for his cellulitis.
.
In the MICU, the Pt was started on an Insulin gtt overnight for
DKA which was thought to be due to DKA with component of
starvation ketosis and ARF on CRF. Hydration was given and
potassium was repleted. Pt was subsequently transitioned to NPH
in am. He was continued on Cephalexin (day 6) for cellulitis and
on Levo/Flagyl for PNA. Subsequently Flagyl was discontinued and
only Levo and Cephalexin were continued. Blood Cx were obtained.
Pt was also found to have mild troponin lead and ST depressions
in lateral leads which were stable overnight. Heparin gtt was
started initially but was subsequently discontinued.

On ROS the pt denied dizziness, SOB, chest pain abdominal pain,
burning micturition. Bowel movements are normal. He has had a
cough for several days PTA.

Labs:
See below
.
EKG:
Initial: Sinus @ ~95, LAD, ST dep in I, aVL, V4-6, 1mm elevation
in aVR, III
.
CXRAY [**2192-9-12**]
Right upper lobe opacity, possibly aspiration, although
bronchopneumonia is also a diagnostic consideration

Echo:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Renal U/S [**2192-9-15**] No comparison. Right kidney measures 11.9 cm,
and is without evidence of masses or hydronephrosis. Normal flow
is seen. The left kidney measures 12.7 cm, and is also normal in
son[**Name (NI) 493**] appearance, without mass or hydronephrosis. Normal
flow is seen.

IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.
.
A/P:
63 M with DM2, noncompliant on meds, p/w DKA (now resolved),
cellulitis, NSTEMI, PNA, and ARF (on CRF).
.
# DKA: Likely precipitated by med noncompliance, infection
(cellulitis and PNA), and starvation. Acidosis possibly
contributed to by ARF. Pt has been febrile to 101F during the
admission.
