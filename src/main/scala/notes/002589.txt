Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
SBP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis x 2, left IJ, right temp HD line, A-line x 3, Left
PICC

History of Present Illness:
53-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis
status post liver and kidney transplant in [**11/2169**] who presented
to [**Location (un) 12017**] with abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, found
to have SBP, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
She states the non-bloody/non-billous vomiting started Monday
evening as well as the diarrhea. She states she drank a boost
that exacerbated this. No fevers. She continued to have this
intermittently overnight and awoke Tuesday morning with severe
lower and left sided abdominal pain, 15/10, and constant and
releived with dilaudid. In the OSH, her blood pressures were
noted to be in the 80s with a lactate of 2.4. She was started on
ceftriaxone and given 1.5 grams/kg of albumin. On day of
transfer, other notable lab findings include a wbc of 19,900,
INR: 1.7, and Cr of 2.0 (baseline around 1.5).
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2172-11-16**] for acute renal failure due to volume overload, as
well as an E. Coli UTI. Her Cr prior to d/c was 1.4. With the
question of outflow obstruction vs. rejection in the outpatient
a transjugular liver biopsy [**12-12**] was attempted, but failed due
to diminutive right hepatic vein. There is also speculation from
her Hepatologist that her worsening liver failure is due to
recurrent EtOH use, and she admits to resuming EtOH use in the
fall.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is complaining of abdominal
pain that has somewhat improved from initial presentation.
.

LIVER HISTORY:
- previously been on azathioprine, prednisone, and tacrolimus
immunosuppresion. Azathioprine, previously DC'd due to hair loss
in early [**2169**] and patient was, maintained on prednisone and
tacrolimus, before switching to, tacro sole therapy. Patient
recently restarted on azathioprine again in [**2171-8-24**].
Azathioprine dose decreased in mid [**Month (only) 1096**] for apparent concern
of peripheral edema. Given concern
of diarrhea, azathioprine was discontinued, and patient was
maintained on tacrolimus sole therapy. Due to sole therapy,
would target slightly higher goal of [**5-2**]. Continued atovaquone
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

Imaging:
CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2170-3-5**], there
are lower lung
volumes. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications, most prominent in the
central region,
consistent with pulmonary edema. Poor definition of the left
hemidiaphragm
could reflect atelectasis and effusion.

Although the radiographic abnormalities are most consistent with
pulmonary
edema, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
.
[**1-18**] CXR: CHF with pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions,
together with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation, similar
in appearance to [**2172-1-15**].
[**Last Name (un) 1372**]-/orogastric tube as described.

Brief Hospital Course:
53-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis
status post liver and kidney transplant in [**11/2169**] who presented
to an outside hospital with abdominal pain and found to have
SBP, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
The patient was on the medical service for the first 27 days in
the hospital before being transferred to the liver service.  She
was continued on daptomycin for VRE bacteremia, as well as
ultrafiltration, lasix, and hemodialysis was continued to reduce
volume as she remained oliguric. Supportive nutrition was
continued through Dobhoff. On occasion she developed a rapid
ventricular rate (atrial tachycardia) which responded to IV
metoprolol.  Her standi
