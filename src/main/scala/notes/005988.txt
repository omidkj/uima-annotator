Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory decompensation, transfer from rehabilitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79y/o male with DMII, PVD, CAD s/p CABG and aortic valve
replacement in [**8-12**] course complicated by left arm plegia, HIT
and unable to wean off vent s/p tracheostomy and PEG.  He was
discharged to rehab on [**2104-9-15**].  He was weaned off the
ventilator early in his rehab stay but within the past couple of
weeks has been vent dependent.  It was felt that he may have
developed a vent-associated pneumonia and he was started on
zosyn ([**9-25**] for 7 day course).  He then was started on
levofloxacin when his sputum grew stenotrophomonas
(pan-sensitive) and felt to have persistent "right lung"
consolidation.  He did not have fevers during this time, but did
have significant sputum/secretions.  His BUN/creatinine was
noted to rise and peaked at 2.6 within the past 2 weeks from
unclear etiology.  His diuretics were held during this period
and may have contributed to congestive heart failure.  (BNP 200
checked at rehab and CXR with pulm edema on [**2104-10-10**]).  Within
the past 2-3 days, his diuretics were restarted and on day of
transfer, creatinine 1.8.  An Echo was performed within the past
couple of days showing EF 40% and moderate aortic insufficiency.
 Per rehab he has gained 8lbs since admission on [**9-15**].
Patient's family requested he be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  The wife
states she was concerned that he wasn't sleeping well at night.

.
Of note, since his surgery, he has had a left arm plegia which
was thought to be either from CVA or a brachial plexopathy.

Studies:
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Low
limb lead voltage. Compared to the prior tracing of [**2104-8-24**] no
diagnostic change.
.
ECHO:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 50 %). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There
is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve leaflets
appear normal The transaortic gradient is normal for this
prosthesis. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is probably
present. At least mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. No valvular vegetations are seen.The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2104-8-14**], an
[**Year (4 digits) 1291**] is now present with a mild to moderate paravalvular leak. If
clinically indicated,a TEE may better assess the basis and
severity of the aortic valve prosthesis regurgitation.
.
CXR ([**10-17**]): Comparison made to the prior chest x-ray of
[**9-9**].  The heart is enlarged.  Bilateral pulmonary
edema with alveolar opacification and bilateral effusions is
present.  Tracheostomy tube remains in a good position.
