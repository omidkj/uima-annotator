History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of prostate cancer, stroke,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was recently discharged to
[**Hospital 100**] rehab after an admission for frequent falls.  He had a
history of atrial fibrillation during that recent admission;
however, he was not continued on anticoagulation due to frequent
falls.  He was initially on digitalis, which was stopped due to
a question of MAT.  While at [**Hospital 100**] rehab, he had an elevation
in his BUN and creatine.  He was transfered to the [**Hospital1 **] emergency

was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate to the
130s.  The patient was assymptomatic without chest pain,
shortness of breath, or palpitations.  In the ED, he was given 5
mg IV lasix times four, 10 mg IV labatelol times one, and 25 mg
PO lasix times one without any response in his heart rate.  He
was admitted for rate control.  On review of systems, the
patients notes a productive cough for one week but denies fever,
chills, nausea, or vomiting.

5. History of prostate cancer
6. Questionable history of parkinsonism
7. Multiple falls
8. Right renal mass.

HISTORY:
Returned today to reattempt the consult for this [**Age over 90 **] year old man
who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-11-22**] for ARF and rapid
ventricular rate a-fib, dehydration and pna. PMH includes: CVA
[**79**]
yrs ago resulting in gait ataxia and dysarthria, PAF, h/o
prostate cancer, frequent falls, a question of Parkinsonism,
w/recent admit ([**2173-11-1**]) for multiple recent falls and for rehab
placement. Pt was d/c'ed to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and readmitted from
there.
Wife reports that pt's communication at baseline was noted for
