Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2100-7-2**]  4:36:36 PM
Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Poor R
wave progression. Cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2099-12-13**] ventricular rate is significantly
slower. Lateral
ST-T wave changes have resolved. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

Echo [**2100-7-6**]
Conclusions:
The left and right atria are markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function  (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic root and
ascending aorta are moderately dilated. There are three
moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. There is a minimally
increased  gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) central  aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-7**]+) mitral  regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial  effusion.
IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with preserved global and regional
biventricular  systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid  regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Moderately dilated thoracic  aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2099-12-16**],
estimated  pulmonary artery pressure are slightly higher. The
other findings appear similar.
.
.
CT Pelvis [**7-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large hematoma in left nephrectomy bed, consistent with
acute hemorrhage.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7933**].
2.  Cystic mass in head of pancreas for which followup MRI is
recommended when patient is stable.
3.  Large right renal cysts.
4.  Anterior abdominal wall hernia.
5.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and patchy airspace
disease.
6.  Cardiomegaly.

GI Bleeding Study [**7-9**]
INTERPRETATION:  Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells  labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained.  A left lateral
view was also obtained.  Blood flow images are normal, without
focal abnormal hyperemia. Dynamic blood pool images show no
focal abnormality to suggest active
hemorrhage.
Delayed images obtained 8 hours later also fail to demonstrate
any definite site of active hemorrhage. There is vaguely
increased background activity over the region of the left
nephrectomy bed but none approaching the intensity of the
vascular blood pool.
IMPRESSION: No site of active hemorrhage identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 year old female who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-1**], [**2099**] with multiple medical problems, recently diagnosed
renal cell carcinoma, recent pancreatic cyst aspiration on
[**2100-6-29**], post op for hand-assisted laparoscopic Left nephrectomy
on [**7-1**]. She was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 25503**]#2 becuase of uncontrolled
atrial fibrillation.
.
Her heart rate was stabilized in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] using 60 mg diltiazem
PO qid. She was then transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 on [**2100-7-6**] for further
eval of need for pacemaker and re-starting anti-coagulation for
afib. From a urology point of view, she was stable.
.
Echo on [**2100-7-6**] showed no significant change from [**12-11**] except new
PAH. She was re-started on a heparin drip on [**7-6**] after being
cleared with urology. Given the echo results, there was no need
to place a pacemaker, and per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recs, she was started on
15 mg coumadin (twice her daily home dose) on [**2100-7-7**] at 12:30pm.
On the morning of [**7-8**], she developed diffuse abdominal pain and
tenderness, nausea, and her BP dropped to 80s systolic. [**Date Range **] had
dropped from 28 to 19.9 overnight. BP remained stable with IV
fluids, and she was taken to the SICU for emergent blood
transfusion and monitoring.
.
Of note, she had also developed worsening joint pain and had
been given 30 mg prednisone on the evening of [**2100-7-7**] for a
presumed pseudogout flair.
.
Ms [**Known lastname 45417**] was transfered to the T-SICU on [**7-8**] with an indication
of an  Acute [**Month/Day (4) **] drop 26->19->12, an episode of hypotension
(with symptoms). An immediate CT abdomen was ordered, which
showed a significant hematoma at the nephrectomy site. On this
day, she was given 5 units of packed Red Blood Cells.
.
On [**7-9**], she had an episode of a rash and hypotension during
administration of packed red blood cells. The packed red blood
cell administration was immediately stopped by the nurse. She
was treated with  hydrocortisone and benadryl. The episode
resolved and there were no further complications on this day.
.
On [**7-10**], Ms [**Known lastname 45417**] was given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma as she
had an INR of 2.5. She did not require further packed red blood
cells.
.
On [**7-11**] she was given another 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, 2
units of packed red blood cells 2U FFP, and both her A-Line and
metoprolol were stopped/removed.
.
The following day, her hematocrit remained stable, and she was
due to be transfered to the floor. However, this did not happen
until the following day on [**7-13**] due to lack of bed
availability.
.
On the floor, she did extremely well. She was stable from a
cardiovascular point of view. Physical therapy came in to see
her; they felt she could not go home immediately as she was
slightly unsteady on her feet. Hence, Ms [**Known lastname 45417**] spent another
night in the hospital to be seen by PT the following morning.
That same evening, she was able to walk down the hallway and was
slowly regaining her strength and balance. She complained of
some pain, and was given IV morphine which helped resolve the
pain.
.
Ms [**Known lastname 45417**] was discharged on [**2100-7-15**] with th
