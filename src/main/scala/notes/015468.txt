of pain in his legs.

[**2169-12-7**] Head Ct :
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mild sinus disease.

[**2169-12-7**] CT torso :
1. Left first rib fracture with adjacent stranding which
encompasses the left common carotid artery. The neighboring
[**Name2 (NI) 56207**] appear patent and normal in caliber.
2. Right fifth through eighth rib fractures.
3. Pulmonary contusions within the anterior aspect of the right
middle and
upper lobes and posterior aspect of the left lower lobe, with a
small
laceration within the lower lobe.
4. Tiny left apical pneumothorax.
5. Stranding about the left groin near the external iliac
[**Name2 (NI) 56207**], likely
secondary to attempted vascular access.
6. A small focus of air posterior to the right humeral head is
likely from a recent intramuscular injection.

[**2169-12-7**] CT c spine :
1. No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical
spine.
2. Thickening and focal hyperdensities witin epidural space
raises concern
for an epidural hematoma. MRI is recommended for further
evaluation.
3. Tiny left pneumothorax.
4. Left first rib fracture with neighboring soft tissue
stranding.

[**2169-12-7**] CT Right leg :
Comminuted and impacted fracture of the distal femur, resulting
in splaying of the femoral condyles against an intact tibial
plateau. There are neighboring multiple hematomas and areas of
intramuscular edema. Overlying subcutaneous air is compatible
with an open-type fracture.

[**2169-12-8**] Right hand :
Non-displaced fracture of the distal ulna

[**2169-12-10**] MRI spine :

1. Unusual anterior cervical spinal subdural ("extra-arachnoid")
fluid
collection, extending from C2 to the T2 level. There is stable
longitudinal extent and degree of mass effect on the spinal
cord, with no cord signal abnormality or evidence of evolving
blood products, within. Given the significant injuries elsewere,
as well as evidence of cervical posterior ligamentous sprain,
this likely represents a post-traumatic subdural "hygroma,"
related to CSF leak from occult injury to the [**Doctor First Name **]-arachnoid
membrane.
2. Likely DVA in the left cerebellar hemisphere, incompletely
imaged.


[**2169-12-12**] MRI Head :
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Stable fluid collection posterior to the clivus compatible
with known
spinal subdural hygroma.

[**2169-12-12**] MRI Head :
1. No acute intracranial pathology.
2. Stable fluid collection posterior to the clivus compatible
with known
spinal subdural hygroma.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency
Room and scns were reviewed. He had multiple orthopedic injuries
for which the Ortho Trauma service took care for and he also had
multiple rib fractures, a tiny left pneumothorax and a spinal
epidural hygroma.  He was admitted to the Trauma ICU for
frequent neurologic checks, pain management and pulmonary toilet
due to his multiple rib fractures.

Following 24 hours of neurologic stability he was taken to the
Operating Room on [**2169-12-8**] for ORIF of the right femur and
malleolus.  He tolerated the procedure well
and returned to the TICU in stable condition.  He maintained
stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled.  He
continued with pulmonary toilet and remained free of any
pulmonary complications.

From a neurologic standpoint, the initial CT of the C spine
noted a possible epidural hematoma and therefore he underwent an
MRI of the C spine to further define the anatomy. There was a
substantial size  extra-arachnoidal fluid collection both
anterior and posterior to the spinal  cord.  He had no change in
his neurologic exam but developed a positional headache, quite
severe at times and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] was consulted. After
reviewing the imaging and examining the patient, he felt that
there was a CSF leak due to a spinal dural tear.  An MRI of the
head ruled out any other central etiologies.  Treatment was a
blood patch to the thoracic and lumbar spine which lead to the
successful resolution of headache.

The Psychiatric service also followed Mr. [**Known lastname **] given his prior
history of adjustment disorder/depression.  They contact[**Name (NI) **] his
outside therapist and spoke in detail with both the patient and
his parents.  All agree that he needs close follow up and their
preference is with his own therapist which his parents will
arrange.  In general he has been quiet and slightly withdrawn as
opposed to agitated.  He was placed back on his Prozac.
