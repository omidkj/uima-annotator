Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6075**]
Chief Complaint:
right-sided weakness and worsened mental status


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of afib, HTN, CAD s/p CABG,
dementia, s/p recent R hip fracture and repair (admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**]
[**Date range (1) 89662**]) presents from nursing home with right-sided weakness
and worsening mental status. According to discharge summary,
pt's
INR was reversed with vitamin K prior to recent surgery, and INR
is still subtherapeutic. She has been on lovenox prophylaxis,
though only at 1/2 dose due to a potentially high risk of
bleeding.

Per rehab records, pt was last known well at 11AM, talking
coherently and moving right side well when she complained of
some
right hip pain and was given oxycodone 5mg (her usual dose). Of
note, she had also refused her AM meds today. At lunch (~12:30)
pt noted to be sleepy and difficult to arouse. Physical
therapist
noted right-sided weakness, and pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
evaluation. Arrived in ED at ~2:15 pm (3hrs, 15min since last
known well).

On arrival, pt awake with flaccid right side, moaning, not
following commands. Narcan 0.4mg was given with a positive
effect
on patient's attentiveness, though she remained hemiplegic and
aphasic. Head CT to rule out bleed was done, but required 1mg
ativan for her to remain still in the scanner. After arriving
back in her room in ED, she acutely decompensated with tachypnea
and decreased O2 sat (88%). She was placed on a NRB, and
continued to drop sats to 85%. She was given another 0.4 mg
narcan without effect and flumazenil x2 without effect. She was
also given lasix 20mg, and albuterol MDI. She had good response
to lasix, and respirations improved.

ROS: Per nursing home, prior to event she had no fever,
headache,
abdominal pain. Also no recent falls. Unable to obtain current
ROS as pt aphasic.

Family History:

Physical Exam:
On admission:
General: Frail elderly woman, moaning
HEENT: NC/AT Sclera anicteric. MM dry
Neck: Supple
Lungs: Initally clear to auscultation bilaterally. After
respiratory decompensation, +bilateral wheeze
CV: Irreg irreg, nl S1, S2, no murmur
Abd: Soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Extr: [**12-12**]+ edema bilaterally to knees. Staples on right lateral
thigh, c/d/i.

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status: Eyes closed, but opens to voice. Attends to
people
on both sides, no apparent neglect. Some moaning and babbling
sounds, otherwise no words except after narcan did say "hi" in
response to "hello" one time. Does not follow commands.

Cranial Nerves: PERRL. EOMs full. Does grimace to nasal tickle
bilaterally, though with right facial droop.

Motor: Decreased tone right arm, leg. Moves left arm
spontaneously. Right arm, leg plegic except minimal withdrawal
to
pain. Minimal movement in left leg as well.

Sensation: Minimal withdrawal to pain on right

Reflexes: DTRs intact. Toes were down on left, up on right

Unable to assess coordination and gait.

On discharge: expired.
No spontaneous breathing x1 min.
No palpable or auscultatable pulse >1min.

Pertinent Results:
CT head: Examination limited by motion. Allowing for this
motion, no definite intra-axial or extra-axial fluid
collections, including hemorrhage are identified. There is
prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with
age-related involutional change. There is no shift of normally
midline structures. There is no mass effect. Again noted is
diffuse periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent with
chronic small vessel ischemic change. There is no gross area of
loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation to suggest an acute
infarction. The surrounding osseous structures are unremarkable;
however, the surrounding soft tissue structures show a small
amount of subcutaneous air in the right infratemporal fossa in
the region of the right masseter muscle. There is no air noted
within the brain. This raises the question of trauma to this
area or possibly intravenous air from a recent intravenous
injection.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathology. Small amount of
subcutaneous air in the right infratemporal fossa, suggesting
possible recent trauma or intravenous injection producing this
subcutaneous air.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to Neuro ICU where she had dense R hemiparesis and
global aphasia.  After discussion with the [**Hospital 1094**] health care
proxy it was determined that care would be withdrawn and comfort
measures instituted.  Pt was extubated and she was transferred
to the general floor where she expired peacefully the morning of
[**2191-4-19**].
