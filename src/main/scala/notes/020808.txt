History of Present Illness:
This is a 48-year-old woman with a past medical history of CAD,
HTN, HL, chronic abdominal pain, headaches and fibromyalgia who
presented to ED with nausea. She reports nausea started
approximately one week ago and was concerned it was related to
restarting reglan. She called the covering gastroenterologist
and was referred to the ED. Of note, verapamail was also
recently started and uptitrated by neurology for headaches. She
had brief "twinge" of chest pain which she associated with
feeling anxious in ED and did not require nitro but resolved on
its own. It did not radiate nor was it associated with symptoms
other than nausea.
.
In ED, initial VS: 98.8 107/78 87 18 100%RA. There was concern
for ECG changes (ST depressions III and AVF) so she had two sets
trops which were both negative. She received Ativan 1mg IV x 2
and zofran 4mg IV. BP 110/78 prior to ativan and 80s/50s after
ativan. She subsewquently received 5L NS for hypotension as she
remained in the 80s. She was guaiac negative. Labs significant
for WBC 11.5, HCt at baseline, normal lactate, normal LFTS and
negative UA. Surgery was consulted for abdominal pain and did
not recommend any further workup. Ct A/P unremarkable. ED TTE
with no effusion. VS prior to transfer: 95/63 61 98%RA.
.
On arrival to the unit, she reports her usual chronic headache
and nausea but denies CP, SOB, palpitations, LE edema, fevers,
chills, dysuria, abdominal pain, weight loss.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 45-year-old woman with CAD, fibromyalgia, chronic
migraines who presents to ED the with nausea, who subsequently
developed hypotension in the setting of multiple medications.

HYPOTENSION:  Likely in the context of receiving ativan in the
ED and recently starting verapamil.  Although sepsis,
hypovolemia, and adrenal insufficiency were in the differential,
Ms. [**Known lastname 39729**] did not have any signs/symptoms to suggest these
etiologies.  The patient received a total of 5L of fluid in the
emergency department and her pressures normalized.  A CXR was
not suggestive of an acute process, and blood and urine cultures
are negative to date.  Verapamil, ACE, and other sedating
medications were held.  On day one of hospital admission,
patient was normotensive.  Her blood pressure was 130/80 on
discharge without further intervention.  Her ACE was restarted
but she was instructed to hold the Verapamil until further
discussion with her PCP and neurologist.

CAD:  Although Ms. [**Known lastname 39729**] had initially complained of a "twinge"
of chest pain in the ED, she gave a more concerning story for
unstable angina while in the unit.  Ms. [**Known lastname 39729**] stated that she
has persistent angina, even at rest.  An EKG performed in the ED
was significant for ST depressions in inferior leads during
episodes of chest pain.  She was ruled-out for MI by enzymes.
Patient was seen by cardiology in the ICU and it was recommended
that she have a persantine stress test either during admission
(over the weekend) or very early next week.  Due to the holiday,
patient requested to go home.  Cardiology was in agreement with
this plan.  An email was sent to stress lab director inquiring
about scheduling stres test for early next week.  Patient was
continued on statin, ASA, and ACE.  She is not on metoprolol due
to hypotension with this drug in the past.

DEPRESSION:  Patient was ontinued on fluoxetine and
amitriptyline.

GERD:  PPI continued.

ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Unclear etiology.  LFTs, lipase, and CT were
unremarkable. Could be attributed to ferrous sulfate or reglan.
Patient is encouraged to discuss this with her PCP at next
visit.  Her symptoms subsided throughout admission and she
tolerated a normal diet.

MIGRAINES:  Verapamil was held in context of hypotension.  She
was given tylenol as needed for headaches.
