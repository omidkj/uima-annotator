Pertinent Results:
[**2143-11-19**] Echo: Pre CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
A patent foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results.
POST CPB: 1. Improved left ventricular systolci function with
background inotropic support (Epi and milrinone). 2. Transent
moderate mitral regurgitation after separation from CPB, which
improved to trivial MR/. 3. Preserved right ventricular systolic
function. 4. Moderate eccentric AI.

hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one he was started on beta
blockers and diuretics and diuresed towards pre-op weight. Later
on this day he was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed pre protocol.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, incentive
spirometer he titrated off oxygen with saturations of 93% on
room air.

Cardiac: Beta-blockers were titrated as tolerated. Episode of
Atrial Fibrillation rate 140's. Amiodarone drip was started he
converted to sinus rhythm transition to PO amiodarone remained
in sinus rhythm 60-80.s  Blood pressure stable 100-130's.

GI: H2 Blocker and bowel regime continued

Renal: gently diuresis for volume overload.  Cre peak 1.5
baseline 1.0.  Good urine output.  electrolytes were repleted as
needed.

ID: On post-op day two he had large amount of sternal drainage
and left arm phlebitis.  He was prophylactically started on
Cephazolin, sternal bedatine swab and monitored closely.  On
[**2143-11-28**] he developed LLE cellulitis.  Vancomycin was started.

IV: R. PICC line 48 cm was placed on [**2143-11-29**] terminates in the
SVC was placed for poor IV access and IV antibiotics.

Pain: well controlled on PO narcotics.

Neuro: no neurological deficits noted.

Disposition: he was seen by Physical Therapy and discharged to
home with VNA on [**12-2**]
