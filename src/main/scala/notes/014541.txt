Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
morphine / Cephalosporins / doxycycline

Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p fall, neck fracture and cardiac arrest.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-C5-6 laminectomy and posterior fusion of C4-T1 on [**2126-6-1**].
-Endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o COPD, dementia and HTN who originally presented
to an OSH after he had been found down by his wife after a walk.
As per report, he had fallen down 5 steps and was at his
baseline mental status and taken to an OSH. While at the OSH, he
was noted to be bradycardic to 20s and lost his pulse. Pt
received atropine and CPR was initiated for 1-2 minutes with
ROSC. His imaging at the OSH was significant for a normal head
CT and CT of the C-spine with noted C6 fracture and C5/6
subluxation. He was then med-flighted to [**Hospital1 **] for surgical
evaluation.

Past Medical History:
-COPD
-HTN
-Dementia

Social History:
Pt lives with his wife and previously was independent in some of
his ADLs including but limited to dressing and feeding himself
though over past year his clinical status has been deteriorating
and he now is only oriented to himself and requires full time
care.

Family History:
Not relevant in this [**Age over 90 **] yo male

Studies-
-CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**2126-6-1**])
Small right subgaleal hematoma. No acute intracranial injury.
-CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST ([**2126-6-1**])
Bilateral interfacet dislocation at the C5-C6 level with locked
facets on the left and jumped facets on the right.  Comminuted
fractures at the C5-C6 level, likely from the vertebral bodies.
 Right C7 facet non-displaced fracture.
-CT CHEST, ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST ([**2126-6-1**])
Right lower lobe aspiration.  Followup of several incidental
imaging findings will depend on the patient's overall clinical
status. Thyroid nodules could be evaluated with thyroid
ultrasound. A pancreatic head hypodense mass could be evaluated
with MRI.
-pCHEST ([**2126-6-7**])
As compared to the prior radiograph from [**2126-6-6**], bilateral
lower lung opacities which are from a combination of
mild-to-moderate pleural effusion and accompanying atelectasis
have not really changed much. On the left side, at least a small
component of this effusion appears to be loculated. Since the
patient is rotated, the assessment of cardiomediastinal
silhouette was further limited. Upper lungs are clear. A feeding
tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, its
distal end is off the radiographic view. fixation device in the
cervical spine regions is seen.
-CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT ([**2126-6-1**])
There has been placement of a right-sided subclavian catheter
with distal lead tip in the mid SVC. There is a cervical spinal
hardware. There is atelectasis of the lung bases. There are no
signs for overt pulmonary edema.  Mediastinum is within normal
limits. There is a feeding tube whose distal tip and side port
are not well seen distally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with h/o HTN and dementia initially
admitted to surgical service after he had been found down by his
wife and found to have [**Name (NI) 110670**] subluxation vs frature, received
c5/c6 laminectomy and posterior fusion on [**2126-6-1**]. Post-op
course complicated by respiratory distress code blue on [**2126-6-5**]
which resolved after short term T-SICU intubation transferred to
medicine service for further management

# S/p respiratory Distress
Following his operation, the patient was noted to be in
respiratory distress on [**6-5**]. His oxygen saturation was noted to
be in the 70s and he was intubated.  This was felt to be
secondary to a likely mucus plug.  The patient was successfully
extubated and his gag reflex began to improve.  He continued to
require frequent suctioning to help with his secretions but this
has improved and his saturation has been stable on [**4-7**] liters of
nasal cannula oxygen supplementation though with intermittent
transient desaturations requiring nasotracheal suctioning. The
patient will likely continue to aspirate and he is unable to
clear secretions. He will require intermittent [**Last Name (un) **]-tracheal
suctioning. Failed speach and swallow and he remains NPO with
Dophoff for feeding. Sputum gram stain and culture sent off
nasotracheal suctioning with only oropharyngeal flora and no s/s
of pneumonia.

# S/p cardiac arrest
As per report, the patient became bradycardic to the 20s and
subsequently lost his pulse soon after his arrival to an OSH
prior to [**Hospital1 18**] transfer.  He was given atropine and underwent
CPR for 1-2 minutes with return of spontaneous circulation.
Although the etiology may not be clear, it was felt that it was
possibly secondary to increase vagal tone in the setting of his
neck fractures.  The patient should avoid nodal blocking agents
given the reports of bradycardia preceding the arrest at the
OSH. He does have occasional transient drops in HR to 20s after
nasotracheal suctioning, this is most likely vagal and his HRs
return to 60s after completion of suctioning.

# C6 fracture, C5/6 subluxation
Occurred following a fall down 5 steps as per his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
underwent a successful C5-6 laminectomy and posterior fusion of
C4-T1 on [**2126-6-1**].  The patient is to keep the C-collar in pla
