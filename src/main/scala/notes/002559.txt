NOTE:  This dictation will cover the period from the point
that the patient was admitted to the point that the patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  Hence, it will
serve as a dictation from [**2160-1-28**] to [**2160-1-29**].  The rest will be dictated by the Medical Intensive
Care Unit house staff.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient's chief complaint is chest pain
and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft (saphenous vein graft to left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to diagonal,
and second obtuse marginal to posterior descending artery) in
[**2152**], with a history of an abnormal MIBI studies times two,
status post abnormal MIBI in [**2159-9-3**] with moderate
reversible defect at the apex, septum, inferolateral wall.
She deferred catheterization on last admission in the setting
of flat enzymes and positive MIBI.

The patient now presents with shortness of breath that awoke
her this morning which has progressively worsened through the
morning.  The patient has no chest pain.  No fevers.  No
chills.  No nausea.  No vomiting.  No abdominal pain.  No
dysuria.  No melena.  No swelling in the lower extremities.

At 6:45 a.m., she developed 8/10 chest pain which decreased
to [**6-12**] with three sublingual nitroglycerin and then [**3-12**]
status post 2 mg of morphine sulfate.  She was started on
nitroglycerin drip in the Emergency Room.  She was
guaiac-negative.  She was started on a heparin drip.  The
patient was then chest pain free.  She states that otherwise
she has not had chest pain or shortness of breath since her
last admission.  She states that she is able to do all of her
activities of daily living without difficulty.

On [**2159-9-24**], the patient had a Persantine MIBI with
a moderate reversible perfusion defect in the apex, septum,
inferolateral walls, and an ejection fraction at that time of
59%.  She had apical hypokinesis new since MIBI in [**2157-9-3**].  An echocardiogram in [**2158-11-3**] revealed an
ejection fraction of 60%, nonobstructive focal hypertrophy of
the basal septum.  No aortic stenosis.  No aortic
regurgitation.  Trivial mitral regurgitation.  There was 1+
tricuspid regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Otherwise, the patient's past medical
history is significant for)
 1.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft with saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft to diagonal, and
second obtuse marginal to posterior descending artery in [**2142**]
with a recent abnormal stress MIBI (as mentioned above).  The
patient is status post four catheterizations.
 2.  History of emphysema.
 3.  History of hypertension.

catheterization (per patient).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Tylenol 325-mg tablets one tablet by mouth at hour of
sleep.

 7.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 8.  Valium 5 mg by mouth as needed.
 9.  Ranitidine 150 mg by mouth twice per day.
10.  Albuterol as needed.
11.  Nasacort.
12.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:   The patient's allergies are to SULFA.

FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient's family history is significant
for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and myocardial
infarction in father.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Her social history is significant for the
fact that she lives alone in [**Location (un) **] housing.  She is
divorced.  She does all of her activities of daily living.
No ethanol.  No tobacco.

CODE STATUS:  She is a full code.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
her temperature was 96.3 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart rate
was 57, her blood pressure was 110/48, her respiratory rate
was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on room air.
Generally, a very pleasant female in no acute distress.  She
was alert and oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
The extraocular movements were intact.   The oropharynx was
clear.  The mucous membranes were moist.  The neck was supple
with no jugular venous distention.  There was no
lymphadenopathy.   Cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rhythm, bradycardic.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops
were noted.  The lung examination revealed there were
bilateral bibasilar crackles.  No wheezes or rales.
Otherwise, the lungs were clear.  The abdomen was flat, soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Guaiac-negative.  There were
good bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed the
extremities were clear of any clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
There were 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Bilaterally, the
patient groin was free of any bruits.  Neurologic examination
revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  Strength
was [**5-7**] and symmetric.  The toes were downgoing.  The skin
was clean, dry, and intact.  There were no lesions or rashes
were noted.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
admission laboratory data included a white blood cell count
of 4.8, her hematocrit was 40.5, and her platelet count was
91 (baseline 82 to 150).  Differential revealed neutrophils
of 61 and lymphocytes of 26.  Sodium was 138, potassium was
4.3, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 30, blood urea
nitrogen was 26, creatinine was 1, and her blood glucose was
156.  Her calcium was 9, her magnesium was 1, and her
phosphate was 4.  Creatine kinase was 44.  Troponin was less
than 0.01.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING FINDINGS:  A chest x-ray was significant
for mild tortuosity.  The lungs were clear.  Chronic scarring
of the right lung base.  Scoliosis, status post median
sternotomy.

Electrocardiogram revealed a right bundle-branch block.
There was a sinus rhythm.  There were ST depressions in V4
through V6.  There was a normal axis.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
[**Hospital 228**] hospital course by issue/system was as follows.

1.  CHEST PAIN ISSUES:  The patient's first set of cardiac
enzymes were negative.  She was continued on nitroglycerin as
well as heparin drip.  The plan was that the patient would be
ruled out for a myocardial infarction.

Initially, the patient was resistant to have cardiac
catheterization.  Hence, it was decided that the patient
would be medically managed.  The patient did rule out for a
myocardial infarction.

On day two of admission, the patient agreed to a cardiac
catheterization which revealed the following.  Left
ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation with an
left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%.  Coronary
angiography revealed a right-dominant system.  The left main
coronary artery with mild diffuse disease.  The left
circumflex with serial 70% stenosis before grafted obtuse
marginal.  The right coronary artery to mid PL filled by
left-to-right collaterals.  The saphenous vein graft diagonal
to obtuse marginal was patent with 70% focal stenosis in
obtuse marginal limb.  The saphenous vein graft to left
anterior descending artery had a 3-mm X 13-mm cypher stent
delivered to obtuse marginal.

Status post procedure, the patient was maintained on
Integrilin.  Status post procedure, the patient was noted to
be hypotensive to 96/57.  The patient underwent a computed
tomography scan to rule out a retroperitoneal bleed due to a
6-point hematocrit drop from 40 to 33.  This computed
tomography scan revealed no retroperitoneal bleed.  However,
the patient became agitated again and became hypotensive t
