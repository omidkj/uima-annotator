referred for evaluation of leukocytosis.

History of Present Illness:
75yo man with h/o metastatic prostate ca, status post
chemotherapy and XRT in [**2118**] and [**2119**], on Lupron, dementia, EtOH
aubse, transferred from NH [**2126-5-17**] for evaluation of leukocytosis
(WBC 18.9) and ARF (Creat 1.7). Patient initially diagnosed with
RML pneumonia and hyperanatremia for which he was being treated
with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and 1/2NS hydration. On morning
of [**2126-5-19**] patient had generalized seizure involving
tonic-clonic movements of right side. He was treated with
lorazepam 4mg iv and Dilantin load. He continued to be somnolent
all day, responsive only to pain. At baseline per NH, patient is
oriented to person and place. Today patient again noted to have
seizure like activity, tremoring in left arm and responsive only
to pain. Hospital course also complicated by onset of
thrombocytopenia and 10-pt Hct drop on day one. Hypernatremia
and renal failure resolved with 1/2NS fluid hydration. He was
initially treate with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for presume
community acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic coverage expanded to
include vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir as
empiric treatment for meningitis.
.
Patient unable to provide history. Per records, NH had noted
decreased po intake prior to hospitalization and complained of
cough, no fevers or chills. He was admitted to [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital [**12/2125**] for agitated behavior and started on Depakote at
that time.

HOSPITAL COURSE LABS OF INTEREST:
.

.
IMAGING:
ADMISSION CXR: Right middle lobe pneumonia. Followup imaging is
necessary to document radiographic resolution.
.
[**5-19**]: CT HEAD: Left sphenoid sinus air cell mucosal thickening
and air-fluid level consistent with acute-on-chronic sinusitis.
Otherwise no significant change from [**2125-4-7**].
.
[**5-21**]: Bilat LENI's: Negative
.
[**5-22**]: Renal ultrasound: The right kidney measures 9.3 cm. The
left kidney measures 9.4 cm. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis. There is again noted a complex cystic structure
in the upper pole of the left kidney which could not be
completely evaluated in this study due to inability of the
patient to hold the breath.
.
[**5-22**]: MRI/A:
1. A very small right parietal subdural fluid collection.
Alternatively, this could represent dural metastatic disease or
benign intracranial hypotension.
2. Questionable left anterior cerebral artery 2-mm dilation
versus, possibly a vessel loop for which a repeat MR angiography
when patient's condition improves would be helpful for further
evaluation to more conclusively exclude an aneurysm.
3. Probable chronic infarcts, as noted above.
.
[**5-23**]: CT head: Tiny chronic right parietal subdural extra-axial
fluid collection.
.
[**5-23**]: CXR: Nasogastric tube and right subclavian central venous
catheter remain in standard positions. Heterogeneous opacity in
the right lung base is worse, likely progressive pneumonia.
Additionally, worsening right perihilar opacity is likely
pneumonia or possibly hilar lymphadenopathy. New left lower lobe
opacity is atelectasis or loculated fluid simulating
atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusion are slightly
increased. There is no pneumothorax.
.
[**5-24**]: Bone Scan: 1. New mild, heterogeneous increased uptake of
the upper thoracic spine and left posterior ribs, as well as
greater tracer uptake of previously described left anterior
iliac spine lesion. Findings are compatible with progression of
metastatic disease.
2. Band like increased uptake greater at T12 and new at T10 is
most compatible with progression and development of osteoporotic
compression fractures, respectively.
3. Focal increased uptake at right maxilla, more notable on
today's exam;
findings would be unusual for site of metastasis and may relate
to sinus
inflammatory disease.
.
[**5-28**] CT sinus/mandible: Sphenoid sinusitis.  Bilateral
mastoiditis, left greater than right.  .
.
[**5-30**] RUQ u/s: 1.  Coarsened liver echotexture without definite
signs of cirrhosis. 2.  Three suspicious-appearing lesions in
the right liver lobe, concerning for metastases.
3.  All hepatic vessels are patent with appropriate waveforms
and direction of flow. 4.  Gallstones.
.
[**5-31**] MRI C and T spine c gadolinium: 1)  No abnormal epidural
fluid collections or soft tissue density in the cervical and
thoracic spine.
2)  Compression deformity of the T12 vertebral body with
retropulsed bone
fragments extending into fixed narrowing the spinal canal
without associated soft tissue component.  This T12 compression
deformity was identified on a CT from [**2125-4-6**].
3)  Diffusely abnormal signal throughout the cervical and
thoracic spine
vertebral bodies that are consistent with diffuse metastatic
disease.
4. Approximately 3cm soft-tissue mass within suboccipital
subcutaneous fat to the right of midline, clinical correlation
suggested.
.
[**6-2**] Portable CXR: Worsening right mid and lower lung pneumonia.
.
[**6-2**] RUQ u/s: 1. Gallstones with somewhat complex
pericholecystic fluid, worrisome for acute cholecystitis in the
appropriate clinical setting.  The patient was somewhat
combative, and assessment of [**Doctor Last Name **] sign was limited. This could
be further evaluated with HIDA scan.
2. No definite intrahepatic ductal dilatation
3. Pleural effusion.
4. Redemonstration of target lesion in the right lobe of the
liver, suspicious for metastasis as noted previousely. .
.
[**6-3**]: Portable CXR: 1.  Stable right mid lung pneumonia and
bilateral pleural effusions.
2.  Well-circumscribed, oval nodule in the right mid lung.
Location is
difficult to assess on a single-view chest radiograph, and this
may represent an intra- or extra-pulmonary finding.  Continued
followup is required after treatment to assess resolution. If
persisent, CT would be recommended.
.
[**6-5**]: Portable CXR: 1.  Progression of right lung
