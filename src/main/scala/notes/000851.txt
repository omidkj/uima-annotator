[**Last Name (STitle) 82578**]


History of Present Illness:
71 female with cholangiocarcinoma scheduled for surgery now with
a single episode this AM of blood in the toilet bowl mixed with
[**Known lastname **] BM, also colored a bit of the surrounding water. No blood
on tissue.  Isolated episode, BM after that was normal. Ate
beets with her dinner.
Per Dr[**Name (NI) 1369**] note:
Briefly, she was evaluated for abdominal pain in [**2195-5-15**]. She
had prior outside CT scans on [**2195-4-8**] that demonstrated a
6 cm focus of decreased density within the liver and a 2.6 cm
exophytic mass coming off the posterior
cortex of the left kidney. On [**4-17**] an outside MRI
demonstrated a 7 x 4.5 x 7.5 cm mass thought to possibly
represent an atypical area of focal nodular hyperplasia. She was
also noted to have a fatty liver. The exophytic mass off
the left kidney measured 2.8 x 1.8 x 2.7 cm concerning for renal
cell carcinoma. On [**6-5**] a MRI demonstrated a mass measuring
7.7 x 6.1 x 6.9 cm within segment 4 of the liver but extending
into the anterior segments of segment 5. There was an obstructed
dilated bile duct raising the possibility
of a peripheral cholangiocarcinoma. There was also a second
discrete progressively enhancing lesion within the peripheral
aspect of segment 5 and it was thought to either represent
metastases versus FNH. There is also a subtle third lesion in
the dome at the junctions of segment VII and VIII. She also had
a 2.2 x 2.4 x 2.6 cm exophytic lesion of the lower inner pole
lesion of the left kidney. There was a 1 cm left adrenal nodule
not characterized at the time of this workup. A biopsy of the
lesion on [**6-18**] demonstrated metastatic moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma positive for CK7, cytokeratin
cocktail, P504S/AMACR and carbonic anhydrase 9. The tumor was
negative for mammoglobin, GCDF, TTF-1 and PAX-2. The immuno
phenotype was nonspecific.  The tumor was compatible with renal
artery  but failure to stain with PAX-2 was unusual and
additional sites were considered. Chest CT
demonstrated no evidence of metastases. CT colonoscopy
demonstrated only a 6.5 mm polyp in the mid transverse colon.
She was referred for consideration of resection. She was felt to
require a right hepatic trisegmentectomy and underwent right
portal vein embolization and this had adequate hypertrophy of
the left lateral segment.
The surgery will be performed in conjunction with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 82578**]

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 174**] was admitted to the transplant surgery service on
[**2195-10-2**] for right trisegment hepatectomy for cholangiocarcinoma
and left partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.  The
hepatic portion of the surgery was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and the partial nephrectomy was completed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of urology.  There were no complications during the
surgical procedures.  The patient remained intubated and was
transferred to the SICU from the PACU.  The patient was weaned
off of pressors and extubated on POD 1.  She remained stable
throughout the day and night and was transferred to the floor on
POD2.

Neuro:
Post-operatively the patient was delirious secondary to pain
medication.  After the IV pain medications were discontinued on
POD 2, the patient became much more responsive and remained
lucid (AAOx3, appropriate) throughout the remainder of her
hospital course.

Cards:
Patient was hypertensive with systolic blood pressures in the
180s on the floor (POD 2).  Her home valsartan dose was
increased from 160 qd to 320 qd and she responded with good
effect.  She was normotensive for the remainder of her hospital
course.

Pulmonary:
Her course on the floor was complicated by a pleural effusion on
the R.  This was drained by thoracentesis on [**2195-10-8**] and was
found to be concerning for exudative effusion secondary to
infection and therefore the patient was started on Unasyn.  A
repeat CXR on [**10-9**] showed residual fluid.  A CT chest and
abdomen was obtained to rule out residual effusion. A repeat
thoracentesis was performed on [**10-12**] and the WBC increased to
7625 with 50% polys. The antibiotics were changed to Levaquin
and Flagyl which she will be continued on for two post discharge
date ([**2195-10-28**])

Renal:
Following the surgeries, the patient was fluid positive almost
10kg.  Her UOP was adequate throughout her postoperative course,
and her creatinine remained stable (0.8-1.3).  She began
mobilizing fluid and had increasing UOP starting on
postoperative day 2.  In order to assist in diuresis, severel
one time doses of lasix were administered on days ([**Date range (1) 11879**]).
By the time of discharge, the patient was 5kg above her admit
weight. Monthly creatinine values are recommended to be obtained
per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 82578**].

GI:
The patient began taking sips on POD1, was advanced to clears on
POD2, and tolerating a regular diet by POD5 without any nausea
or vomiting.  She had return of bowel function by discharge
without any diarrhea.

Endocrine:
Patients finger sticks were all within an acceptable range
100-140s during her postoperative recovery on an insulin sliding
scale.

Musculoskeletal:
Patient was difficult to mobilize following surgery secondary to
pain and fatigue.  She worked with physical therapy and was able
to ambulate in the hallways with assistance however, it was
believed that she would benefit from a short stay in a rehab
facility but then was cleared by PT for home with home PT

Heme: CT of abdomen obtained on [**10-9**] to evaluate pleural
effusion and possible bile leak returned an incisdental finding
of "Status post left partial nephrectomy with thrombus in the
left renal vein." She was initiated on heparin and started on
Coumadin when appropriate. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 82578**] recommended a 3 month
coumadin course. She will be followed by VNA for PT/INR with
results to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 698**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 699**] RN for dosage changes initially.
