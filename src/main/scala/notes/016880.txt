Pertinent Results:
[**2146-8-8**]
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with normal free wall
contractility.
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS
The patient is AV paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
There is a new aortic valve bioprosthesis. It appears well
seated without evidence of aortic insufficiency. Residual
gradients are peak/mean of 22/16 mmHg.
Left ventricular systolic function continues to be normal.
Mitral regurgitation is now mild (1+).
Thoracic aorta is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted same day surgery and was brought to the operating room
for aortic valve replacement.  See operative report for further
details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative antibiotics
and was transfered to the intensive care unit for post operative
management.  In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
complications.  He was placed on CIWA with prn ativan due to
alcohol history. All lines and drains were discontinued in a
timely fashion. Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis was
initiated. On post operative day one he was transfered to the
floor.  Physical therapy worked with him on strength and
mobility. Pacing wires were left in an additional day due to
juctional rhythm on post operative day 3. He had an episode of
transient postop atrial fibrillation managed with increased
beta-blocker.  He was tolerating a full oral diet, ambulating in
the halls with assistance and his incisions were healing well.
It was felt that he was safe for discharge home with visiting
nurse services on post operative day #5.All follow up
appointments were advised.
