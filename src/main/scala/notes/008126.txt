Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3127**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right colectomy


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 46 y/o M with hx of ESRD on hemodialysis, DM, Htn, CAD
and recent diagnosis of SVT who presents with SOB. Pt normally
has HD on MWF. This am, he missed his HD because he was taking
care of his sister's children. Over the course of the day he
gradually became more short of breath and decided to come to the
ED. Pt denies any dietary indiscretion. He also tries to watch
his fluid intake but reports that he has more difficulty with
this. He estimates that [**5-6**] kilos of fluid are removed at each
dialysis session. Pt denies CP.
.
Of note, pt reports that he has had "a cold" since [**Holiday 1451**].
He was treated with a course of Biaxin with some improvement,
but that he has had worsening cough and fatigue again since the
end of that treatment. He reports temperatures around 99,
without chills. He also reports coughing up greenish-brown
sputum. He reports that the rest of the family is suffering with
similar symptoms.
.
He reports feeling extremely tired, especially since his
Toprolol XL dose was increased to 200mg. He denies CP. He does
complain of abdominal discomfort in the epigastric area, but
says this pain is not new for him. He had a EGD and colonoscopy
in the past which was normal according to the pt. He also
reports diarrhea but says that he has had diarrhea off and on
for "a long time". The diarrhea recently worsened, so he took
Immodium with some relief. He reports that the diarrhea is
liquidy but not watery and that he has been going to the
bathroom up to 7-8 times per day, at its maximum, but its now
improving. He does still make urine, approximately 1 L per day.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt had CXR consistent with fluid overload. He was
given Lasix 80mg IV and started on a Nitro drip to titrate BP to
110-130. He was also given calcium gluconate for his
hyperkalemia. He was sent for HD where he began to feel
decreasing SOB.

Studies:
AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY:  The cardiac silhouette is
enlarged.  There is bilateral hilar fullness in pulmonary
vascular distribution and interstitial edema. Consistent with
Moderate/severe volume overload.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2104-12-18**]:  Subtle pericolonic stranding in the
cecum, ascending colon, thought likely to reflect an infectious
etiology.  As the  patient has some subtle colonic thickening
here, a tumor with microperforation is considered, although
thought less likely.
.
ECHO [**2104-12-22**]:  EF  25-30%, new pan-wall motion abnormalities


Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB: The pt's shortness of breath is most likely related to
fluid overload since he developed the SOB after missing his
scheduled HD. On exam, the pt appeared to be working hard to
breathe, crackles were heard in both lower lung fields and the
pt had an elevated JVP and lower extremity edema.  The CXR was
consistent with fluid overload.  There were a few expiratory
wheezes bilaterally, indicating a component of reactive airway
disease likely exacerbated by a respiratory tract indection. The
pt reported that he has had a cough productive of greenish-brown
sputum since [**Holiday 1451**]. He also reports that the rest of the
family is suffering with similar symptoms. After dialysis the pt
was only mildly short of breath. He was also treated with
albuterol and then atrovent for presumed reactive airways
disease. By the morning after admission, the pt reported that
his SOB had resolved.
.
# Afib with RVR: The pt has had several recent ER visits for
paroxysmal Afib with RVR. Prior episodes were well controlled
with metoprolol. On the evening of admission, the pt was noted
to have a low blood pressure of 70/40 with a heart rate of 119.
The pt was mentating normally throughout the episode. He did not
complain of any CP, SOB, light headedness or dizziness. An EKG
showed Afib with RVR, in addition to anterior ischemia. The
patient's Afib did not repond to 2 IV doses of 5mg metorpolol,
but it did responded to Diltiazem 2x 10mg IV. The pt's heart
rate came down to the mid 80s to mid 90s. The pt's low BP
responded to IV fluids and was 100-110s/60-70s after the pt
received 1.5L of fluid during the episode of RVR. The pt
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm the following morning.
Pt had no further episodes of Afib. His Toprol dose was reduced
to 100mg QD and Diltiazem 60mg PO QID was added. Three sets of
cardiac enzymes were stable and did not suggest any myocardial
infarction. The pt's EKG after converting back to sinus rhythm
showed no persisting evidence of infarction. LFTs and TSH were
sent in case pt would need to be started on amiodarone. LFTs and
TSH were normal. PFTs should be done as an outpatient before pt
starts amiodarone. Pt will follow up with his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], on Monday and to get home monitoring to determine how
frequently he has episodes of Afib.
.
# Abdominal pain - On [**12-17**], after dialysis pt began to complain
of crampy abdominal pain. He had 3 normal bowel movements and
then developed non-bloody diarrhea. Overnight he vomited once,
non-bloody, non-bilious. On the morning of [**12-18**] the pt spiked a
temperature to 102.2. Pt's labs showed a WBC of 17.8. The pt's
pain became worse over the morning. Pt was extremely tender in
the right upper and lower quadrants. His abdomen was soft, but
he did have some voluntary guarding. Pt was made NPO and had an
upright AXR which showed no free air but was limited due to pt's
body habitus. Pt was evaluated by surgery who recommended a CT
abdomen which showed mild stranding around the cecum and mild
wall thickening???? Pt's history is concerning for ischemic
bowel in the context of atrial fibrillation with possible clot
vs hemoconcentration after hemodialysis
