History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6943**] is a 60 y/o male with polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] for past 20+
years c/b portal hypertension, esophageal varices, portal vein
and splenic vein thrombosis presents with 1 week history of
progressively worsening right arm pain, swelling, and erythema.
He has a history of prior portal vein thrombosis, on coumadin.

He reports that he had been doing a lot more manual labor as of
late
including moving furniture and weight lifting with his son. His
arm became more swollen the morning of [**5-13**] and he applied two
Bengay patches with no resolution. He was advised by his PCP's
nurse that if it did not resolve by Wednesday that he should
present himself to the ED.

He denied chest pain and cough but does report some shortness of
breath just prior to recieving his CT scan. He denies rest pain
and claudication. He also denies fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. For his PV, he has required yearly
phlebotomy when his hematocrit becomes higher than 42. He has
not required phlebotomy in over a year. He takes daily coumadin
for his PV.

In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5, 81, 110/71, 16, 100 RA. Exam
was guaiac negative. Patient was given zofran, morphine, heparin
gtt with 5000 unit bolus. Labs notable for INR 2.2, Hct 39, Cr
0.8. CXR wnl. Patient underwent CTA chest which showed PE within
right lower sugmental and right upper posterior brances, no
right heart strain. Thrombus nearby extends from right SVL to
confluence of of the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC. Small
ascites. RUE ultrasound confirmed, "Complete occlusion of the
right subclavian vein along with partial occlusion of the right
axillary vein. No clots visualized in left subclavian, right IJ,
right basilic, or brachials. Bilateral Lower extremity veins
negative.

Images:
[**5-15**] RUE US: Complete occlusion of the right subclavian vein
along with
partial occlusion of the right axillary vein due to thrombosis.
Proximal
extent of thrombus not seen. Patient to have chest CT.

[**5-15**] CT Chest WOW: IMPRESSION: 1. Pulmonary emboli within the
right upper and lower segmental and subsegmental arterial
branches, and distal left lower subsegmental branches. 2. Large
thrombus extending from the right subclavian/axillary junction
to the confluence of the right brachiocephalic vein and SVC. The
SVC and left brachiocephalic vein are patent. 3. No dissection.
4. Unchanged large hepatic cysts, splenomegaly, small amount of
ascites, and extensive intra-abdominal varices.

[**5-16**] Echo (TTE): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**5-16**] BL LE US: IMPRESSION: No DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6943**] is a very pleasant 60 y/o male with history of
polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] c/b portal hypertension, and PV/SV thrombosis
presents with arm swelling and DVT extending from the axillary
vein to the junction of the brachiocephalic and SVC, also noted
to have PE within right lower segmental and right upper
posterior segmental arterial branches.
.
# Extensive right sided DVT and PE as mentioned above: he
remained hemodynamically stable throughout his course. The DVT
extends from the axillary vein to the junction of the
brachiocephalic and SVC, and he was also noted to have a PE
within the right lower segmental and right upper posterior
segmental arterial branches. There is no evidence of right heart
strain and this all occurred despite of an INR 2.2 on ER
presentation. Vascular surgery was consulted, however decided
ultimately not to place and SVC filter not perform thrombolysis
given the risks of such an intervention.  The patient was
followed by hematology (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**], whose recommendations were
to continue heparin, and to order Factor V Leiden, PT gene
mutation, anticardiolipin IgG/M, B2 glycoprotein, CD55 and 59
for PNH, and DAT which were sent and pending. A LE duplex was
negative for DVT. He was transitioned to Lovenox and discharge
home in stable condition.
.
# History of Splenomegaly/Esophageal varices: These issues did
not appear active during this admission. He was continued on his
home doses of nadalol and pantoprazole.
.
# HTN: Nadolol was continued.
.
Pending labs: CD 55/59, and other hyper coagulable workup as
listed previously.
Transition of care: will follow up with hematology and vascular
surgery.
