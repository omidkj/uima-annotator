History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2391**] is a 66-year-old male with hx HIV on HAART,
lymphoma, LUL lung adenocarcinoma s/p resection, hx CAD s/p PCI
with DES in [**5-17**] to proximal circumflex artery. In [**11-16**] he had
elective cath showing 90% restenosis at proximal edge of
previously placed stent, treated with overlapping Cyper stent.
Mid-RCA was 80% occluded and treated with DES as well. In [**2-18**]
pt had a left femoral artery to dorsalis pedis artery bypass
graft with an in situ greater saphenous vein graft. His plavix
was discontinued at that time. He was recently admitted on
[**2188-4-30**] w/ STEMI over III, F, taken to cath, where he had a DES
placed in the LCX for the vessel being occluded by a thrombus
proximally. Of note, at cath [**4-30**], he had a totally occluded
right external iliac artery. The pt was discharged home [**2188-5-3**].
Since that time, per the pt, he felt at baseline, with the
exception of intermittent left leg pain (s/p vascular surgery,
bypass) that would occasionally awaken him at night. He stated
he was up this morning at 4am b/c of this left leg pain, when he
developed a "cold rough" feeling in his esophagus similar to his
pain that he had with all of his prior MIs. He states it was a
[**5-24**] in severity. He took 1 nitro, and it resolved. He reports
he did not take his plavix yesterday and today. He noted
intermittent right sided chest pain as well last night, which
felt like "gas pain", + SOB, no diaphoresis, + nausea, no
vomiting. He states the feeling returned and then persisted,
took a 2nd nitro but it only decreased the pain to a [**2192-2-16**]. He
called 911.
.
In the ambulance, the pt's pain decr to [**1-25**] and he received
ASA, another nitro en route. His pain, however, only resolved
completely on nitro gtt at OSH where he was given ASA, IV
integrillin, IV heparin, started on nitro drip with full
resolution of pain, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent cath. His
initial BP at OSH 130/75, down to 93/63 after nitro. Outside
labs with CK 60, other ezymes pending at time of transfer, BNP
17.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he was given plavix 600mg load prior to cath. In the
cath lab: LCX was totally occluded within proximal stents. A
wire was passed and flow was reestablished (likely development
of blood clots). 1 additional bare metal stent (no DES since he
had questionable compliance w/ plavix) placed distal to last
stent. Some non-occluding stenosis in the distal branches. Cath
was performed via radial artery (per lower ext arterial
disease). His right groin (femoral vein) developed a hematoma.
His left groin was not accessed given his c/o left leg pain post
surgery 2 months ago. He was subsequently transferred to the
floor. He then had BP drop to 90s/40s-50s and a pm HCT was found
to be 27.7 (6 point drop from pre-cath HCT). He is being
transferred to the CCU for unstable HCT and hematoma with labile
BP s/p catheterization today.
.
Brief CCU event: CT scan of abd neg for RP bleed. Neg groin for
psuedoaneurysm. Stable hct. Received total of 3 units of blood.
2 unit pRBC for hct 27 ([**5-9**]) -> 31.6 ([**5-10**] Am)-> 29.5-> 28.2
([**5-10**] 1pm)->32.3 ([**5-10**] 12pm)-> 31.8 ([**5-11**] 4am)


Past Medical History:
S/p left VATS and wedge biopsy of the left upper
lobe [**4-18**] for adenocarcinoma.
Non-hodgkins lung lymphoma
HIV
CAD
Bladder Ca, s/p resection
S/p bowel resection

Social History:

since lung operations, but smoked for 40 years 1ppd, still
smokes a cigarette ocasionally, no EtOH. No IVDA.

Pertinent Results:
CATH [**2188-5-9**]
LMCA: nl
LAD: 50% mid disease
LCX: Total occlusion within proximal stents
RCA: not injected
Abdominal aortography: mild left common femoral disease. femoral
graft patent with no signficant disease seen in graft or native
vessels to above the knee.
Intervention: Successful treatment of IPMI with BMS. Using right
radial approach, LCA engaged with AL2 guide. Stent occlusion
crossed with wire and bballoon with restoration of flow showing
progressed diesase to 80% just distal to stents. PTCA with
suboptimal result so 2.5X18 minivision stent placed into larger
upper pole which had multiple moderate lesions. prior stents
redilated with 3.0 balloon. No residual, normal flow in all
branches.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with HIV, CAD, recently admitted for STEMI
found to have 100% LCX lesion and stented w/ DES, who presented
with STEMI to OSH, and found to have total occlusion of proximal
LCX stent, now s/p bare metal stent placement. Pt was then found
to have a hematocrit drop and hypotension necessitating
transfuse to CCU, now stabilized.
.
Blood loss: Pt was s/p catheterization with R wrist for arterial
access and R groin for venous access. CT scan was performed, and
ruled out RP bleed and U/S ruled out AV fistula and
pseudoaneurysm. He received a total of 3 units PRBCs in CCU, and
his hct has been stable. Pt likely had blood loss during cath,
and in groin hematoma. After being transferred back to the floor
from the CCU, his Hct was stable. Low-dose metoprolol was
started the night before discharge, and he tolerated this with
SBP in the 100s to 110s.
.
Cardiac. Patient was admitted with a repeat STEMI secondary to
instent thrombosis. He had placement of a bare metal stent, and
was started on higher doses of plavix at 150 mg daily. He was
continued on aspirin and a high dose statin as well. His
antihypertensives were held due to hypotension, and restarted
prior to discharge.
He was not diuresed further, despite an elevated PCWP of 28 at
catheterization, due to hypotension. He remained in normal sinus
rhythm.
.
Hyperbilirubinemia: the pt was noted to have mild jaundice and
scleral icterus on [**5-12**]. LFTs were checked and his total
bilirubin was 6.6, direct bili was 0.2. His other LFTs were
normal. His hemolysis labs were normal. The hyperbilirubinemia
was felt to be most likely due to either reabsorption of the
large hematoma or a side effect from one of his HIV meds, most
likely atazanavir. His bilirubin continued to climb but he was
otherwise asymptomatic. A RUQ U/S showed small gallstones but no
evidence of cholecystitis or obstruction. His statin and HIV
meds were stopped on discharge.
.
HIV: Patient was continued on his outpatient HIV medications. He
was continued on prophylactic bactrim. He was continued on his
antidepressants.
.
Dispo. Patient was discharged to home with a stable hematocrit.
