Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9160**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia, S/P Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation and Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 y/o female with a h/o systolic heart
failure with an EF of 35-40%, atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
MDS requiring monthly transfusions whose family called EMS
initially due to lethargy and somnolence.  Last night at around
5pm her family noted that she was lethargic and sort of leaning
to one side, but initially left her alone because they thought
she was tired.  However, later that night at around 11pm she was
much less responsive than usual, so the family called 911.  She
lives with her grandson and has a full time nurse during the
day, yesterday she was complaining of an upset stomach and
having diarrhea.  Additionally, her family says that she has had
poor po intake for the few days prior to admission.
.
On arrival EMS found her minimally responsive, they put her on a
monitor and found that she was bradycardic to the 30's, so they
put pacer pads on her.  She then reportedly bradied down and
lost her [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report was PEA.  At that time she received 2
minutes of CPR and 1mg of epinephrine with ROSC, her heart rate
remained in the 30's and they began to externally pace her.  She
was then taken to the [**Hospital3 **] ER.  At the OSH ER she
was intubated due to significant pain associated with external
pacing, she was then started on a versed gtt for sedation which
caused her to become hypotensive so she was started on
peripheral neo.  Labs at [**Location (un) 745**]-[**Location (un) 3678**] were notable for an INR
of 2.0, BNP of 285.1, K of 6.0, Cr of 2.5 (baseline 0.8-1.0),
BUN of 69, AST of 60, ALT of 40, t-bili of 1.4, WBC of 8 (24N,
12 band, 44L, 10M, 2E, 2atypical, 1myelo, 4 blast, 7NRBC's), HCT
of 32.4, plt of 84, troponin I of 0.11. With the mildly elevated
troponin she was briefly started on a nitro gtt, but after
discussion with our ER physicians since she was on peripheral
neo the nitro gtt was discontinued.  A CT of her head was
negative.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 36.3C, 81, 135/114, 93% on AC
16x400, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 100%.  On arrival to our ER she was
initially on a versed drip but was agitated and biting on her
tube, so she was transitioned to propofol for sedation.  When
they went to transition her to the external pacer in our ER her
heart was in the 60's to 70's so she did not require external
pacing.  Cardiology was consulted who felt that she did not
require treatment for an NSTEMI since her troponin was
indeterminate at the OSH, they recommended adission to the MICU
and they would see the patient in consultation.  Labs were
notable for lactate of 6.9 that improved to 4.1, Cr of 2.3, INR
of 2.0, HCT of 31.4, plt of 94, CXR showed her ETT in the proper
position.  VS on transfer: 70, 118/64, 24, 100% on AC 100%, PEEP
5, 420 x 18.
.
On arrival to the MICU, her initial VS were: 97.3, 67, 128/50,
96% on 18x400, she was awake and following commands. Denied any
pain, otherwise appeared comfortable.

STUDIES

TTE [**2136-3-29**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Marked biatrial enlargement. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Moderately depressed global left ventricular systolic function.
