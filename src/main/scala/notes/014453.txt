CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 70-year-old male
transferred from an outside hospital, where he presented with
chest tightness and shortness of breath times one week.  At
the [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital he ruled in for an acute MI by enzymes
and ST depressions.  His troponin peaked at 13.3.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented to
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**9-12**] complaining of increasing dyspnea
times three months, usually, with exertion, but occasionally
occurring at rest, especially over the past twenty-four
hours.  He also reported new chest tightness at that time,
lasting ten minutes, relieved by rest, associated with
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and lightheadedness.  His
EKG showed significant LVH with anterolateral ST depressions.
His initial CPK was 460 with an MB of 49 and troponin of
10.5, which subsequently peaked at 13.3.  His symptoms were
relieved at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital, but IV nitrates, he was also
started on Heparin and aspirin at that time, as well as
Plavix.  Echocardiogram done, also at the [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital,
showed aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 cm squared,
peak gradient of 87 mmHg, apical hypokinesis and a normal
ejection fraction.  While at the [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital the
patient was also dose with IV steroids for COPD exacerbation.
He was then transferred to [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for
cardiac catheterization.  Please see catheterization report
for full details.  In summary, the catheterization showed an
LAD with 80% stenosis; circumflex with an 80% stenosis; RCA
with a proximal total occlusion with collaterals to the LAD.
Cardiothoracic surgery was then consulted, and the patient
was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting, as well as
aortic valve replacement.

On [**9-17**], the patient was brought to the operating
room, where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting
times four with a LIMA to the LAD and SVG to OM and SVG to
diagonal 1 and an SVG to the RCA, as well as an aortic valve
replacement with a #23 pericardial tissue valve.  He
tolerated the operation well.  Please see the OR report for
full details.  He was transferred from the operating room to
the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of
transfer the patient's mean arterial pressure 72; PAD 14;
heart rate was 84 normal sinus rhythm.  He was transferred on
nitroglycerin and propofol infusions.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Shortly, after arrival from the operating room, the patient's
anesthesia was reversed.  He was weaned from the ventilator
and extubated.

On postoperative day #1 he remained hemodynamically stable,
and he was transferred to the floor for continuing
postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next two postoperative days the patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was followed by cardiothoracic
surgery as well as physical therapy, who assisted in
increasing his activity level.

On postoperative day #4, the patient's course was complicated
by several runs of atrial fibrillation with a ventricular
response of 110 to 120 beats per minute.  He remained with a
blood pressure of 106/63 during these episodes.  He was
treated initially with IV Lopressor, followed by p.o.
Amiodarone, after which, the patient converted to normal
sinus rhythm.  The patient stayed in the hospital for an
additional three postoperative days, during which time he
remained hemodynamically stable with a heart rate between 60
and 80.  He occasionally had short episodes of atrial
fibrillation lasting from 5 to 15 seconds, always returning
to a normal sinus rhythm with a blood pressure between 90 and
110/50-60.  His Lopressor was increased during that period of
time.

On postoperative day #7, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready for transfer to a rehabilitation facility
for continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
At the time of transfer, the condition of the patient is
stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting times four with a LIMA to the
LAD and SVG to OM; SVG to diagonal and RCA; aortic stenosis
status post AVR with a #23 pericardial tissue valve;
hypertension; hypercompression; asthma/COPD; chronic renal
insufficiency; peptic ulcer disease; arthritis.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.
3.  Lasix 40 mg q.d. times ten days.
4.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq q.d. times ten days.
5.  Albuterol inhaler, two puffs q.4h.
6.  Serevent inhaler two puffs b.i.d.
7.  Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d. times seven days, then q.d.
times 30 days.
8.  Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.
9.  Zoloft 50 mg q.d.
10. Vioxx 25 mg q.d.
11. Lipitor 10 mg q.d.
12. Percocet 5/325, 1-2 tabs q.4h.p.r.n.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on [**9-24**] revealed the white
blood cell count 10.8; hematocrit 26.3; platelets 297; sodium
143; potassium 4.2; chloride 104; CO2 27; BUN 29 and
creatinine 1.7 from a baseline of 1.5; glucose 122.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  Physical
examination at the time of discharge revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.1; heart rate 72 sinus rhythm;
blood pressure 110/64; respiratory rate 20; O2 saturation 94%
on room air.  Weight preoperatively is 79.9 kg; on discharge
84.4 kg.

Physical examination revealed the patient to be alert and
oriented times three, moves all extremities, follows
commands.  Respiratory:  Diminished in the bases bilaterally,
no rales.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and
S2 with no murmur.  Sternum is stable.  Incision with
staples.  Small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the
base.  No erythema around the margins.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Warm and well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Right lower extremity incision with Steri Strips open to air,
clean and dry.

The patient is to be discharged to a rehabilitation center.
He is to have followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in three to four weeks
and followup with his primary care provider in four weeks.
