Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath
EP study s/p ablation
ICD placement

History of Present Illness:
69 yom with known CAD h/o MI in '[**59**], s/p PTCA in '[**55**], PAF, HTN,
DM, COPD, CRF, and hx of meningioma presented to [**Location (un) **] w/ [**7-4**]
SSCP for 4 hours.  Pt also complained of associated dizziness.
This pain was completely resolved with SLNTG.  He was found to
be in stable VT and was converted to NSR with lidocaine bolus +
gtt.  This sinus EKG was noted to be no different from the prior
ones.  Pt also got ASA, BB, Heparin gtt, ativan, lasix 20 mg iv
there.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Pt
CP free on arrival. Pt was taken straight to the cath lab/EP
lab.

NEURO: Alert+ oriented x3, CN III- XII intact.  Visual acuity

Pertinent Results:
EKG: NSR 68 BPM, nl axis, deep S in V1-V4, J-point elevation in
V1-V2, III, q-wave in III.  ST depression in V4-V6, I, aVL.  No
significant changes compared to the EKG from [**4-26**] except for
J-point elevation in III.

Cath ([**11-8**]): chronic occlusions of RCA + LCx with collaterals.
LMCA 30%, 50% LAD, 40% Ramus.  elevated LVEDP with LVEF 45%,
+MR, infero basal akinesis, inferior hypokinesis.

EP ([**11-8**]): Showed 2 foci of inducible VT which pt became
hypotensive requiring 200 J shock -> sinus rhythm. These foci
were ablated. A fib occured during the case and terminated
sponteneously c/w PAF.  The main foci of VT with same morphology
as the presentation EKG, unable able to map out and ablate.
Possibly in epicardium.

Echo: EF 45% E;A ratio 1.50  The left atrium is elongated. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include thinned/aneurysmal basal to mid
inferolateral segment and hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal
inferior wall. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with
trivial mitral stenosis. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
1)Rhythm: Pt presented to the OSH with stable VT that was
terminated with lidocaine bolus and drip.  Pt was in sinus
rhythm on arrival and went to the cath lab and underwent EP
study.  Multiple sites were mapped and ablated.  There were 2
foci that induced rapid VT resulting in hypotension requiring
cardioversion with 200 J.  These foci are were ablated
successfully.  They also detected a-fib whch terminated
spontaneously which is consitent with his history of PAF.  There
was a main focus of VT with the same morphology as the VT shown
on EKG at OSH.  This focus could not be mapped and ablated.  The
location wa inferobasal area that is presumed to be in
epicardium.  After transferred to the unit for observation, pt
had 5 episodes of asymptomatic 30-50 beat NSVT that terminated
on it's own.  Several hours later, pt had an episode of
sustained VT lasting 1-2 min and subsequently had chest pain and
became hypotensive to the SBP 50's.  Lidocaine 100 mg was given
and the VT terminated.  Pt was placed on lidocaine drip
initially at 3 mg/hr and was weaned to 1mg/hr.  Pt then got ICD
placed (Guidant VITALITY DS Model T125 DR [**Last Name (STitle) 23278**] [**Numeric Identifier 23279**]).  Due
to the history of paroxysmal a-fib, pt is recommended to be
started on coumadin as outpatient.  Pt was discharged with
metoprolol 50 mg po bid for rate control.  Pt got TSH and LFT's
which were normal.  CXR showed no acute pulmonary processs.  Pt
should get an outpatient PFT's since he will be started on
amiodarone.

2)CAD: Pt underwent cath prior to the EP study which showed
chronic occlusions of RCA + LCx with collaterals. 30% LMCA, 50%
LAD, 40% Ramus.  Elevated LVEDP with LVEF 45%, +MR, infero basal
akinesis, inferior hypokinesis.  Pt had an elevated CK, most
likely in a setting of VT with old occlusion of RCA + LCx.  Pt
was discharged with ASA, BB, Lipitor.

3)Pump: EF 45%, pt was continued on lisinopril 40 mg po qd, and
metoprolol 50 mg po tid.  Pt appeared euvolemic.

4)HTN: BP in good range with metoprolol + lisinopril

5)COPD: Advair and albuterol was initially held since it could
potentially trigger VT from B-receptor.  Smoking cessation was
encouraged.  Atrovent was continued but pt became wheezy.  After
the ICD placement, pt resumed his Advair, Atrovent, and
Albuterol.

6)F femoral a. bruit: Pt noted to have R femoral bruit after the
cath to the right groin.  Femoral artery ultrasound was done
which showed ###################.

5)DM: Glipizide was held initially for cath but was later
re-stasrted.

6)CRI: Pt got Mucomyst and peri-cath hydration.  Creatine was
stable post-cath.

7)Hyperlipidemia: Lipitor was continued
