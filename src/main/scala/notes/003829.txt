Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7015**]
Chief Complaint:
seizures, confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**1-16**]: Intubation for airway protection
[**1-17**]: Failed extubation, then re-intubation
[**1-20**]: Successful extubation

History of Present Illness:
In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 4640**] is an 83 year old male with past medical
history
significant for HTN, HL, MI s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, dCHF
(EF>55%), borderline DM, and mild COPD who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] TICU after onset of seizures of unclear etiology.
.
Per TICU summary, patient had been in his usual state of health
up until the early morning of [**1-16**] when he fell trying to walk
to bathroom around 3am. Per reports, wife witnessed patient
fumbling at the doorknob and subsequently fell to the floor
"like a log". He then had sudden stiffening, tremors and
residual right sided weakness, confusion and somnolence. EMS
took patient to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where code stroke called and
patient had a brief second repeat seizure that was effectively
treated with IV Ativan. He had right hemiparesis that persisted
and needed intubation for airway protection. Initial OSH head CT
negative. [**1-16**] MRI head also showed no acute infarcts but
evidence of chronic small vessel ischemic disease and volume
loss noted. OSH ED Labs notable for K of 7.8 (unclear if
hemolyzed) and he received calcium gluconate, dextrose/insulin
and K recovered. at initial ED evaluation, tPA was not pursued.

.
On [**1-16**] he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] TICU for further
evaluation. In the ED, CT/CTA performed which were unremarkable.
Infectious workup showed negative LP, CXR, and urine. Neurology
team felt that patient's history and exam was most consistent
with a post-ictal [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis verus CVA or infection. Since
patient was admitted he has been stable on Keppra therapy with
no repeat seizures thus far.
.
He initially remained intubated in TICU after admission for
airway protection and extubated on [**1-17**] but then required
repeat intubation after he had notable dyspnea, generous
yellowish sputum production and desaturations to high 80s range.
Extubated successfully on [**1-20**] and now comfortable at 93% O2
Saturations but continues to have mild cough and fevers.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4640**] was transferred to the neurology service on [**1-20**]
and additional workup has been limited from a neurological
standpoint with no clear cause for his seizures to date. As
above, he has been seizure free on Keppra management. On [**1-21**]
he had episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR to 120s per neuro
team but this resolved after IV metoprolol and he has since been
well controlled on higher oral metoprolol dose of 75mg TID ; up
from his usual home atenolol dosing.
.
He is being transferred to medicine service now for further
management due to more complicated hospital course which has
evolved and includes complicated HAP/VAP, intermittent atrial
fibrillation with RVR, hyponatremia, worse anemia and ongoing
fevers. [**1-17**] Sputum Culture grew out Moraxella catarrhalis and
he has been continued on IV ceftriaxone and Azithromycin
(started [**1-18**]) and . Vancomycin had been started but was
recently discontinued on [**1-23**].
.
He appears to be in no apparent distress at rest and is fully
alert and oriented now. Current vitals at time of transfer:
T:97.9F, BP: 143/72, HR: 88, RR: 24, O2: 97% 2L.

Past Medical History:
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia
-s/p MI and 5 vessel CABG in [**2114**]
-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
-diastolic CHF
-borderline DM
-BPH
-mild COPD

Social History:
Lives at home with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1727**]. He was very independent
with all ADLs at baseline prior to this event with seizure.
Stopped smoking about 40 years ago but had smoked 2PPD x 15-20
years. Drinks a glass of wine daily about 5 days week. No
illicits.
.


Family History:
 Father died of an MI and his mother had mild dementia.
