Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH after he presented there s/p fall, altered
mental status, hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal tube placement, extubation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 4597**] is a 63 yo male with hx of obesity, DM, CAD s/p
stent on [**1-17**] who presented to [**Hospital6 33**] today by
his wife who found him on the floor.  She had seen him around
945 am normal, left for an appointment, and when she returned
she was on the floor, but awake.  She called EMS.  EMS found the
patient dysarthric with difficulty moving.  FS was 70 and on
recheck 240.

At the [**Hospital3 **] ED he was aphasic.  He became cyanotic with
decreased respirations and was intubated.  Prior to intubation
it was reported that he had no focal neuro deficits, although he
was only partially following commands.  There was also concern
for a right-sided facial droop.  A code stroke was called and he
underwent a head CT which was negative for bleed.  Neuro
evaluated him and he was admitted to their ICU.  Of note, the
EKG in the ED showed new atrial fibrillation.  There was also
verbal report that he had persistent hypoglycemia and was
treated with D50 and placed on a D10 gtt.   He also underwent a
head CTA which was negative and right humerus X-ray which showed
an unchanged communited and impacted fracture.

On arrival to the MICU he is normotensive, sedated, and
intubated.

Unable to obtain ROS as patient is intubated and sedated

.
EKG:  sinus rhythm with no STE or STD
.
Imaging:
OSH imaging:
CTA head [**2160-2-18**]:
No major vessel stenosis or occlusion evident.
.
non-con head CT [**2160-2-18**]:
No large territtorial infarct of hemorrhage identified.

humerus X-ray [**2160-2-18**]:
Comminuted and impacted fracture of the proximal right humerus.
.
CXR [**2160-2-18**]: left-sided PICC line with tip projected over the
distal SVC.  Shallow inspiration.  Likely mild vascular
congestion.
.
CT C-spine ([**2-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or subluxation.
2. Left paracentral disc herniation at C5/6 deforms the spinal
cord and
causes moderate spinal canal narrowing. If there is a clinical
suspicion for a cord contusion or chronic myelopathy, MRI would
be helpful for further evaluation.
3. The endotracheal tube terminates. Recommend advancement.
.
CTA chest ([**2-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Central venous catheter terminating in the proximal azygos
vein.
3. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities likely representing
pulmonary
edema.
4. Bibasilar consolidation, somewhat heterogeneous within the
left lower lobe likely representing a combination of atelectasis
and pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
**OUTSTANDING ISSUE: Incidental finding on CT spine, C5-C6 disc
herniation
.
63 yo male with hx of obesity, DM, CAD s/p stent on [**1-17**]
transferred from an OSH after being found down, altered, and
possibly cyanotic in the setting of hypoglycemia.
.
#  Fall/altered mental status/?stroke:  Unclear etiology of his
fall, may be secondary to hypoglycemia.  Had head CT, C-spine,
and CTA which was negative for acute process or PE.  Nonfocal
neuro exam here.  Cortisol normal.  CE trend negative.  Still
unclear what caused his fall.  Mental status is currently at
baseline. Neuro exam non-focal, RUE exam limited by pain.
.
#  Hypoxic respiratory failure/PNA:  Most likely due to an acute
aspiration event during period of altered mental status, but PNA
could also have been the driving event causing his hypoglycemia
and acute mental status changes.  CTA demonstrating diffuse
bilateral ground glass opacities and bibasilar consolidation
concerning for  PNA and ruled out PE.  Given recent hospital
exposure and concern for aspiration he was initially started on
vanc/zosyn.  This was broadened the morning after admission with
cefepime (instead of zosyn) and levofloxacin.  Sputum culture
gram stain showed
