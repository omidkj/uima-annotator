Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. TDI E/e' < 8, suggesting
normal PCWP (<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Calcified
tips of papillary muscles. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness and cavity size are normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hyopkinesis of the distal half of the anterior septum. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55-60%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with mild regional systolic dysfunction but overall
preserved ejection fraction. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88842**] was admitted [**2116-10-9**] following Exploratory right
thoracoscopy, right
thoracotomy, right upper lobe and right middle lobe bilobectomy,
mediastinal lymph node dissection, intercostal muscle flap
buttress, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. He was
extubated in the operating room, transfer to the ICU on
Phenylephrine for hypotension. Cardiac Enzymes were negative x
3. Echocardiogram was done (see above report). Over the next 24
hours his blood pressure improved with small fluid challenges,
titrated off pressors and transfer to the floor [**2116-10-11**] with 2
right chest tube, Foley and Dilaudid PCA, Bupivacaine Epidural
managed by the acute pain service.

Respiratory: incentive spirometer, ambulation and good pain
control he titrated off oxygen with room saturations of 100%.

Chest-tube: apical removed [**2116-10-12**], basilar placed to bulb
suction removed [**2116-10-13**].

Cardiac: remained in sinus rhythm, Lopressor and diltiazem with
slowly titrated back as blood pressure improved.  On discharge
he was on his home dose of Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem 30 mg
tid.

GI: PPI and bowel regime

Renal: normal with good urine output.  Electrolytes replete as
needed.

ID: low grade temp, WBC 13, CXR with new left lower lobe
opacity.  He was started on a 10 day course of Levofloxican with
improved WBC.

Pain: Epidural and PCA were converted to PO oxycodone with good
pain control.

Disposition: he was seen by physical therapy, ambulated in the
halls independently and was discharged to home with his family
and [**Hospital3 **] VNA.  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
