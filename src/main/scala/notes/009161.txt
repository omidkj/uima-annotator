CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transfer from [**Hospital6 27369**] with
chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74 year old
woman with known CAD status post MI and cath in [**2100-2-5**]
with LAD stent placed at that time.  She presented to the
outside hospital with chest pain.  She complained of three
days of chest pain upon awakening across her shoulder blades
and down her arms, lasting one to 1 1/2 hours, worse at night
when she lays down.  She presented to the outside hospital
emergency room one day prior to admission to [**Hospital1 346**].  Given the history of CAD and
strong suspicion for acute coronary syndrome with troponin
that was mildly positive at 0.12 as well as break through
pain on heparin and nitroglycerin drip, the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
management and evaluation of chest pain.

which was treated with medicine.  Cath in [**2100-2-5**]
showed RCA 50%, LAD 95%.  The LAD was stented at that time.
Patient had complete heart block while the balloon was
wedged.  Following the procedure she had left bundle branch
block.  Status post right CEA in [**2099-1-5**].  COPD.
Hypertension.  Hyperlipidemia.  Osteoporosis.  C-section.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

over one year ago.  No alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission vital signs temperature
98.2, heart rate 85, blood pressure 142/72, respiratory rate
20, O2 sat 96% on 2 liters.  In general, in no acute
distress.  HEENT pupils equally round and reactive to light.
OP clear.  Mucous membranes moist.  Neck no JVD.  Chest clear
to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles.  Heart sounds
regular rate and rhythm, sounds distant, no murmurs, gallops
or rubs.  Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender, normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities with 1+ edema on the dorsal aspect
of the left foot.  No ankle edema.  Dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial 2+ pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.3, hematocrit 31.2, platelets
241.  PT 12.5, PTT 37.7, INR 1.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.7,
chloride 107, CO2 27, BUN 18, creatinine 0.7, glucose 99.  CK
44, troponin 0.03.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was followed by the medicine
service upon admission to [**Hospital1 188**].  On [**5-9**] she was brought to the cath lab.  Please
see the cath report for full details.  In summary, the cath
showed left main 40% to 50%, LAD 95% at proximal edge of
patent LAD stent, left circumflex 95% lesion, RCA with
diffuse luminal irregularities.  At that time CT surgery was
consulted and patient was consented for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  Prior to going to the operating room,
patient underwent carotid Doppler exams which showed no
significant lesions in either the right or the left carotid
arteries.

On [**5-11**] the patient was brought to the operating room.
Please see the operative report for full details.  In
summary, patient had coronary artery bypass grafting times
four with LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to OM2, saphenous
vein graft to diag sequentially to OM1.  She tolerated the
operation well and was transferred from the operating room to
the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.  At the time of
transfer patient's mean arterial pressure was 72, CVP 15.
She was AV paced at 80 beats per minute.  She had epinephrine
0.03 mcg per kg per minute and propofol 10 mcg per kg per
minute.  Additionally, patient was on milrinone 0.25 mcg per
kg per minute.  In the immediate postoperative period patient
was kept sedated and ventilated as she was hemodynamically
unstable with labile blood pressure and cardiac index which
resolved with the initiation of milrinone and additional
volume in the immediate postoperative period.  Additionally,
patient had mild respiratory acidosis.

On the morning of postoperative day one the patient was
hemodynamically stable.  She was weaned from milrinone.
Sedation was discontinued.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  Later in the day of
postoperative day one patient was begun on small doses of
Lopressor secondary to tachycardia.  However, with the
initiation of Lopressor, she displayed complete heart block
which required temporary pacing.  Several hours later patient
recovered her sinus rhythm and remained hemodynamically
stable throughout this period.  On the morning of
postoperative day three patient's PA catheter, chest tubes
and Foley catheter were discontinued and she was transferred
from the cardiothoracic intensive care unit to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Once the floor, with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapist, patient activity level was increased.
Over the next several days her Lopressor dose was gradually
increased until on postoperative day five it was decided that
patient was stable and ready to be transferred to
rehabilitation for continuing postoperative care and
rehabilitation.

At the time of transfer, the patient's physical exam was as
follows.  Vital signs temperature 98.4, heart rate 110 sinus
tach, blood pressure 142/80, respiratory rate 20, O2 sat 92%
in room air.  Weight preoperatively 69.9 kg, at discharge
76.4 kg.  Lab data white count 10.5, hematocrit 35.7,
platelets 214.  Sodium 139, potassium 3.4, chloride 97, CO2
34, BUN 27, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121.  Alert and oriented
times three.  Moved all extremities.  Followed commands.
Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart sounds
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 with no murmurs.  Sternum was
stable.  Incision with staples open to air clean and dry.
Abdomen soft, nondistended, nontender with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with 1+
edema bilaterally.  Left leg incision with staples.  Small
amount of serosanguineous fluid draining from the upper pole
of that incision.

vein graft to diag and OM1 sequentially.
2.  Status post right carotid CEA.
3.  COPD.
4.  Hypertension.
