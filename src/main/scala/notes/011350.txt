Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85113**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2130-4-6**]. He had a CT head and
C-spine and a pre-op work up. He had a craniotomy for tumor
resection on [**2130-4-7**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Debulking of the tumor was
achieved. The patient remained hemiparetic post-resection. CT
and MRI post-operative revealed expected post-operative changes.
He was observed in PACU overnight due to lack of SICU beds.
After a stable course in the PACU he was transferred to the
floor.  He remained stable on the floor workign with PT and OT
in preparation for discharge.  It was felt that he would be most
appropriate for rehab. He began being screened on [**4-10**]. On [**4-11**] he
was neurologically stable, tolerating a PO diet, voiding without
problem. [**Name (NI) **] was cleared for discharge to rehab.
