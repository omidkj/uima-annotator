Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
52F with history of likely COPD (on 2L O2 at home), T1-T2 spinal
injury and subsequent paraplegia c/b recurrent UTI's ([**First Name3 (LF) 40097**]
klebsiella) with multiple recent admissions for
hypoxia/pneumonia presented to the ED with complaint of dyspnea
and hypoxia 48 hours after discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] for similar
complaint. During previous admission, patient came in with
hypoxia and chest x-ray concerning for multi-focal pneumonia.
She was started on empiric antibiotics, CT was negative for PE.
Due to absence of other infectious symptoms - no fever or
leukocytsosis - antibiotics were discontinued and she was
treated with nebulizers as needed. She was discharged on home
O2. Since discharge, she has had gradually worsening secretions
- green, per husband. Despite aggressive chest PT by husband and
PCA, she was found to be hypoxic in mid-80's today on pulse
oximeter and unable to increase with additional oxygen. Poor Po
intake, talking to herself for past 24 hours. She was brought to
the ER for further evaluation. Of note, previous admission on
[**4-17**] for RLL pna, dc'd on linezolid, cipro) with 3 days of
levaquin, meropenem and 4 days of concomitant vancomycin before
dc'ing due to improved clinical status.
In the ER, initial vitals were afebrile, 78% on 4L with systolic
blood pressure 110. On exam, she had diffuse expiratory wheezes
bilaterally and 1+ non-pitting edema in bilateral lower
extremities (baseline). Also, notable for leukocytosis. She
recieved combivents with minimal improvement in oxygenation. She
was placed on NRB then 50% venturi mask. ABG prior to transfer
was 7.32/70/150 - on 6L NC. She recieved Vancomycin.

Chest X-ray [**2149-5-17**] - Findings suggestive of moderate
pulmonary edema. Bibasilar opacities, could represent a
combination of atelectasis and small effusions, however,
superimpsed infection cannot be excluded.
PFT's [**2148-9-30**] - FVC 25%, FEV1 31%, FEV1/FVC 125% (% expected)

Chest CTA [**2149-5-12**] - No evidence of pulonary embolism. 2. Left
upper lobe and lingular ground-glass opacities with smooth
septal thickening. Differential diagnosis includes atypical
infection, hemorrhage, or an unusual distribution of pulmonary
edema. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis with possible coexistent
aspiriation given plugging of the lower lobe bronchi and
fluid-filled upper esophagus.
4. Stable appearance of soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal
recess since [**2148-2-24**]. Further evaluation with MRI may
be helpful to distinguish duplication cyst from solid mass such
as lymphadenopathy. 5. Right hilar lymphadenopathy, increased
since the prior study, and likely reactive. Attention to this
area at the time of MRI (if performed) would be helpful to
ensure return to baseline size. If MRI is not performed to
evaluate the azygoesophageal recess mass, then follow up
contrast-enhanced CT would be recommended in 3 months. 6. Small
right-sided pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 52 female with a history of obstructive lung
disease, paraplegia c/b recurrent UTI's and recent admissions
for pneumonia admitted with hypoxia 48 hours after recent
discharge.

# Community Acquired Pneumonia and COPD Exacerbation: She
required frequent nebulizers and suction in the medical
intensive care unit but was transferred to the floor on hospital
day three. Due to her history of [**Known lastname 40097**] in her lungs, she was
maintained on vancomycin and meropenem while in house. Her
sputum culture grew pseudomonas. The vancomycine was
discontinued. The meropenem was switched to ertapenem for daily
dosing. She was discharged home with services with a total two
week course of antibiotics. She was also treated with frequent
nebulizer treatments, which she also uses at home. Due to her
history of COPD, a five day course of prednisone 60m daily was
added.

# Hypotension: In the MICU, she required fluid resuscitation and
brief pressors for treatment of sepsis. She stabilized and was
transferred to the regular medicine floor.

# Chronic Pain: She was continued on her home regimen below.
- continue methadone 5 mg TID
- continue pregabalin
- continue oxycodone 5 mg q8h prn pain
- continue lidocaine patches

# Anemia: Her hematocrit was stable. She has known anemia of
chronic disease.

# Gastritis - continued omeprazole, con
