CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted with a chief
complaint of hypotension and bradycardia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), type 2
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, polymyalgia rheumatica, and
osteoporosis who presents with fatigue and nausea after
taking an accidental extra dose of 240 mg of sustain release
verapamil and his first ever dose of atenolol (12.5 mg).

The patient was home alone and confused about whether he had
taken his medications.  He took atenolol and began to feel
fatigued and nauseated with substernal chest pain.  The
patient also has been complaining of increased palpations and
vision dimming lately which precipitated the addition of
atenolol in the setting of the patient's history of
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  The patient denies
any recent fevers, chills, sweats, shortness of breath, or
dyspnea on exertion.

After the patient began to experience these symptoms, he
phoned [**Pager number **].  On arrival of Emergency Medical Service arrival,
he was found to be hypotensive with a blood pressure of
80/60.  The patient was also found to be bradycardic with a
rate of 45.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have
severe sinus bradycardia versus sinus arrest and junctional
escape.  He was then given calcium, insulin, glucose, 7
liters of normal saline, Glucagon, and dopamine.  The patient
was subsequently intubated for airway protection.  He also
had a transcutaneous temporary wire placed and was then in a
normal sinus/an accelerated junctional rhythm.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Verapamil sustain release 240 mg by mouth once per day (as
   noted, the patient took and extra dose on the morning of
   admission).
2. Atenolol 12.5 mg by mouth once per day (which the patient
   started today).
3. Glucovance 5/500 mg by mouth in the morning and 2.5/500 mg
   by mouth in the evening.
4. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth once per day.
5. Prednisone 5 mg by mouth once per day.
6. Prilosec.
7. Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
8. Novolog 6 units in the morning and 4 units in the evening.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] denies
any drugs or a history of digoxin use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was not able to be obtained.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
afebrile, his pulse was 80 (which was paced), his blood
pressure was 40 to 113/19 to 70, and he was on 100 percent
FiO2 and intubated with a respiratory rate of 12, tidal
volume was 600, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.
The patient was intubated and agitated.  He had pessary
muscle contractions consistent with transcutaneous pacing.
The lungs were clear.  He had a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.
The abdomen was soft and distended.  There were positive
bowel sounds.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly.  The rest of
his examination was not pertinent.

LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial laboratory data
revealed his white blood cell count was 17.1, his hematocrit
was 36.7, and his platelets were 243.  Chemistry-7 revealed
his sodium was 138, potassium was 5.8, chloride was 102,
bicarbonate was 22, blood urea nitrogen was 31, creatinine
was 1.3, and his blood glucose was 234.  A creatine kinase
was obtained which was 86.  A troponin was negative.
Coagulations were unrevealing.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed a
likely high junctional escape rhythm at 40 with sinus node
activity.  QRS of 118, and no ST-T wave changes.

A chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema and endotracheal tube in
good position.  The pacing wire was also well positioned.

Of note,  the patient had a recent echocardiogram in
[**2106-10-4**] which showed an ejection fraction of 55
percent to 60 percent and symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy, a severe resting outflow tract obstruction of
the left ventricle, as well as 3 plus mitral regurgitation, 1
plus tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  The findings were consistent with hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUES-SYSTEMS:
1. HYPERTENSION AND BRADYCARDIA ISSUES:  It was felt by the
   Coronary Care Unit team that the most likely explanation
   of his hypertension and bradycardia was from the extra
   dose of verapamil he took on the day of admission.  The
   patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit intubated
   with a temporary pacing wire.  The patient was initially
   started on dopamine and then transitioned to phenylephrine
   for blood pressure support.  His nodal blocking agents
   were subsequently held.

Given the high white blood cell count and hypotension, there
was also some concern for sepsis.  The patient had an
infections workup which included blood and urine cultures
which were all negative.  The patient was initially
maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics to cover for
possible infection.

He was also initially given stress-dose steroids as there was
concern that he may have possible adrenal insufficiency given
he is on chronic steroids.  Furthermore, he had a set of
cardiac enzymes which were obtained which were negative.

The patient also had a subsequent echocardiogram done while
in house which showed severe concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy, an ejection fraction of 60 percent, and left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction.  Additionally, there
was mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation seen.

Eventually, the patient's blood pressure began to recover as
the nodal agents worked off and his pacemaker was
functioning.  He was initially started on a labetalol drip as
well as hydralazine for blood pressure control.  It was felt
that after a few days that his nodal blocking agents had
eventually worn off.  Therefore, he was started on metoprolol
and verapamil for blood pressure control and heart rate
control.  The Coronary Care Unit team felt that it was
extremely important he be on nodal blocking agents in the
future, as this is the treatment for hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy.  The patient was eventually continued on
verapamil 40 mg by mouth q.8h. and was then switched from
metoprolol to labetalol for further blood pressure control;
however, the patient stated that he felt extremely dizzy, and
the team attributed this to his beta blocker dose.
Therefore, he was continued on just verapamil 40 mg by mouth
q.8h., and his blood pressures subsequently returned to
[**Location 213**].

On [**2107-6-24**], the patient had a dual-chamber pacemaker
inserted.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did
not have any evidence of hematoma around the pacemaker
pocket.

1. OTHER ISSUES:  As noted, the patient was initially
   intubated for airway protection in the setting of
   receiving 7 liters of fluid.  The patient was eventually
   weaned from intubation and was extubated without incident.
   He was given Lasix as needed as he was clearly volume
   overloaded from having received large volume
   resuscitation.

As mentioned previously, none of the numerous blood cultures
that were obtained were revealing for any type of infection.
The patient was continued on an insulin sliding scale for his
type 2 diabetes mellitus.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
2. Calcium channel overdose with resultant intubation and
   large volume resuscitation.
3. Pacemaker insertion.
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
5. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
6. Hypertension.


DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to contact his primary care physician should he develop any
chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dizziness,
or lightheadedness, as well as any other serious complaints.

MAJOR SURGICAL-INVASIVE PROCEDURES PERFORMED:
1. Intubation.
2. Pacemaker insertion.
3. Temporary pacemaker wire placement.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
