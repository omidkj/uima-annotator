STUDIES
.
EGD [**2-2**]
Impression: 	
Normal mucosa in the esophagus
Gastric ulcer
Friability, erythema and nodularity in the duodenum compatible
with duodenitis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

EGD [**2-6**]
Abnormal mucosa in the esophagus
There was significant edema in the oropharynx and the adult
endoscope was unable to pass despite multiple attempts. The
pediatric endoscope was able to be passed without difficulty.
Erythema and nodularity in the duodenal bulb compatible with
duodenitis
(biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
.
[**2-5**] H. Pylori NEGATIVE
.
TTE [**2-2**]
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right-to-left intracardiac
shunt. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
.
CXR [**2-5**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-4**], the tracheostomy
tube remains in good position. Continued layering pleural
effusions bilaterally, more prominent on the right. Bibasilar
atelectatic change is seen. Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
is consistent with some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
.
CXR [**2-13**]
I see no radiopaque tracheostomy device. Moderate bilateral
pleural effusions mask considerable bibasilar atelectasis, but
there has been no change since [**2-9**]. Heart size is normal.
Pulmonary vasculature is now normal caliber. Mediastinal veins
are not dilated. Right PIC line ends in the mid-to-low SVC. No
pneumothorax.
.
L SHOULDER FILMS [**2-11**]
FINDINGS: Heterogeneous opacities seen at the left lung base
with blunting of the left costophrenic angle, most likely
representing atelectasis adjacent to a pleural effusion. The
visualized ribs are normal. The AC joint is intact with mild
degenerative change including spurring. Glenohumeral joint is
intact. Status post [**Month/Day (4) 24785**] of the left proximal humerus with plate
and screws.
The hardware is intact and unchanged in position. No evidence of
peri-hardware lucency. Unchanged alignment. The fracture line is
slightly less distinct, indicating healing. Ossific fragments
are seen inferior to the glenohumeral joint which may be from
the fracture or intervention.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hardware complication.
2. Mild AC joint osteoarthritis.
3. Probable left lower lobe atelectasis with adjacent left
pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
64M with PMH EtOH abuse, h/x alcoholic withdrawl seizures, HTN
and [**Hospital 982**] transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Hospital s/p
mechanical fall resulting in left humeral fracture found to have
Hct 20 presumed [**2-12**] to upper GI bleed, hospital course
complicated by emergent cricothyroidotomy during intubation for
EGD, and witnessed aspiration requiring percutaneous G-tube
placement.
.
# Left humeral fracture s/p [**Name (NI) 24785**]
Pt underwent [**Name (NI) 24785**] of left comminuted humeral fracture. Pain was
controlled with oxycodone, tylenol and IV fentanyl in the MICU;
transitioned to standing tylenol + occasional PRN oxycodone on
the floor. PT and OT followed. There were no complications.
Sutures removed by ortho; follow-up L shoulder films showed good
alignment and evidence of active healing.
.
# Upper GI bleed
Pt with coffee ground emesis with associated drop in hematocrit.
Initially transfused 2 units of packed cells. Pantoprazole drip
started. EGD revealed Gastric ulcer with blood vessel, however
no active bleeding. Also, friability, erythema and nodularity in
the duodenum compatible with duodenitis. No further bleeding
episodes and was changed to protonix 40 IV BID. After transfer
to the floor, however, he had melanotic stools and another Hct
drop. Repeat EGD again revealed no active source of bleeding.
Serum H pylori antibody was negative. Follow up of the GI
biopsies showed only duodenitis. The patient's hematocrit
stabiliized and subsequent stool was
