History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11946**] is a 76 year-old man with ESRD (dialysis T/Th/Sat),
DM2, CHF, and recent admissions for hypoglycemia who presents
with 4 days of watery diarrhea. He states that the diarrhea
began 4 days PTA on Saturday night. He had not eaten anything
different from his family members except some fish on [**Name (NI) 2974**]. No
one around him has been ill. The diarrhea is mainly watery,
non-bloody. He states he has been having > 20 episodes/day. He
denies abdominal pain, fevers, chills, n/v. Of note, he had one
dose of Ancef on [**5-26**] before his balloon dilatation of his R AV
fistula.
.
In the ED, vitals were 97.0 123/58 75 16 99% RA. CXR showed no
e/o PNA and he was guaiac negative. Lactate was elevated to 7.3
and only decreased to 3.4 after 2 L IVF. He was admitted for
further evaluation and further IVF.
.
Overnight, he continued to receive 125 cc NS/hr. This morning,
he states that he continues to have several episodes of watery
diarrhea. Denies fevers/chills, n/v, abdominal pain, HA,
dizziness, lightheadedness, recent travel. Diarrhea has not
slowed down.

CT abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Retroperitoneal adenopathy and trace pelvic free fluid, of
uncertain
etiology.
2. Gallbladder sludge and trace pericholecystic fluid, without
definite
evidence of acute cholecystitis. Please correlate clinically.
3. New pulmonary abnormalities and cardiomegaly could reflect
interstitial
lung disease such as non-specific interstitial pneumonitis.
4. Atherosclerosis, with mild-to-moderate stenosis of multiple
vessels. No
secondary bowel signs of mesenteric ischemia.
.
RUQ U/S: IMPRESSION: Moderately distended gallbladder with
sludge within and mild gallbladder wall edema. These findings
are most likely related to third spacing in this patient with
ascites and renal failure. Acute cholecystitis can not be
completely excluded, but is considered unlikely. Clinical
correlation is advised. If further imaging work up is
considered, a HIDA scan can be performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M with history of diabetes, ESRD on dialysis, heart
failure, originally presented to the ED with diarrhea on
[**2123-6-1**]. Unknown etiology. On transfer to the ICU, the patient
was on day 9 of hospitalization and has newly noted liver
failure in last 3 days. Patient s/p apnea and subsequent
intubation in dialysis suite and was transferred to the ICU on
[**2123-6-10**].
.
## Respiratory failure:
Apnea in dialysis suite was reason for intubation. Once patient
transferred to MICU, was noted to have a fingerstick blood sugar
of 30. During assessment in the dialysis suite, primary team
reported that he had been hypoglycemic immediately prior to
dialysis and had received an amp of D50. Given this information
and patient's blood sugar shortly after intubation, possible
that apnea related to hypoglycemia. Venous blood gas at time of
respiratory arrest was 7.39/34/318 on NRB, which indicates that
hypercapnea an unlikely cause of his altered mental status or
repiratory failure.
.
## Hypotension:
Underlying tenous volume status given that patient is anuric and
on HD. His baseline BP tends to be 90-100s systolic. All of his
periods of hypotension, including a fall to 60/palp on morning
of [**2123-6-8**] seem to correlate with periods of profound
hypoglycemia. Sepsis is another possibility; however patient has
not been febrile during his hospital course and his WBC count
had a maximum of 11.3 on [**2123-6-8**] after period of hypotension.
WBC count otherwise normal and was 8.0 at time of transfer to
the ICU. Patient was hypothermic to 95.3 upon transfer to the
ICU, but that in setting of FSBS of 30. Patient did have a
lactate elevation to 4.8 at time of respiratory arrest, though
has been as high as 6.8 during this hospitalization (on
[**2123-6-2**]). Possible cardiogenic component of shock related to
worsening systolic function. Related to this, should rule out
acute ischemic event. Cardiac enzymes at time of respiratory
arrest were CKMB of 6 and Trop of 0.22. Baseline troponin in
[**2123-4-20**] of 0.13.  The patient was started on empiric
vancomycin and zosyn, however he had progressively increasing
pressor requirements.  At the time of expiration, he was maxed
out on neo, levo and vasopressin.
.
## Liver failure:
Report that patient "triggered" on the floor for SBP in the 60s
on [**6-8**], which was coincident with sharp rise in liver enzymes.
This points to shock liver as an etiology of his acute liver
failure. In expanding the differential, the degree of enzyme
elevation would point to acute viral hepatitis, autoimmune
hepatitis, toxic ingestion, drugs. Negative for AMA, [**Doctor First Name **], smooth
muscle Ab, Hep C. Has immunity to Hep B (positive surface Ab)
and past exposure to Hep A (Hep A Ab positive). Does have a
ferritin that is greater than assay, which could indicate
underlying hemachromatosis. There is a hereditary
hemochromatosis mutation analysis pending.
.
## Hypoglycemia:
Patient with severe intermittent hypoglycemia of unknown
etiology. He is a diabetic at baseline, though not receiving
insulin this hospitalization gvein his hypoglycemia.
Hypoglycemia likely worsened in setting of liver failure
resulting in impaired gluconeogenesis.  The patient was
maintained on a D10W drip while in the ICU, with q1h
fingersticks and subsequent normalization of his blood sugars.
.
## Coagulopathy:
PTT and INR to 57.2 and 5.2 today from 32.4 and 1.8 in [**Month (only) 547**]
[**2122**]. He did not have coags at time of admission, so rapidity of
rise unknown. Associated with elevated LDH creating a concern
for hemolytic process. DIC at top of differential given concern
for septic physiology. All complicated by underlying liver
dysfunction with recent acute injury, though hepatology
reporting that degree of coagulopathy is out of proportion to
his liver failure.
.
#Shock:
Due to the above medical problems, the patient developed a
worsening lactate metaboli
