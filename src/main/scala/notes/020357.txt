CTA neck ([**2193-3-9**]):
1. Fluid collection in the left side of the neck with
surrounding enhancement
extrinsic to the internal jugular vein, likely an abscess or a
hematoma.
Clinically correlate.
2. Intracranial CTA demonstrates chronic-appearing
occlusion with moyamoya vessels in the region of left middle
cerebral artery.
3. Neck CTA shows calcification at the bifurcation with patent
carotid and
vertebral arteries. Occluded left external carotid is seen with
distal
reconstitution.
4. No evidence of intracranial dural venous sinus thrombosis
visualized but
the superior sagittal sinus is only partially visualized.
5. Degenerative changes are seen in the cervical spine.

CXR ([**2193-3-11**]): In comparison with the study of [**3-9**], the
endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the
carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the distal stomach.
Opacification at the right base medially again could reflect
atelectasis or crowding of vessels. In the appropriate clinical
setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to
be considered. Minimal atelectatic changes are seen at the left
base. No vascular congestion.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Vascular Surgery Service. She
was taken urgently to the OR on [**2193-3-9**] for irrigation and
debridement with wound vac placement. She was kept intubated due
to concern for airway compromise and remained in the ICU for
monitoring. She was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn. She remained
hemodynamically stable not requiring any pressors. She was taken
back to the OR on [**3-11**] for washout and primary closure with a
drain left in place. She was extubated on [**3-11**] without
difficulty. Cultures from the abscess grew Group A strep and her
antibiotic regimen was de-escalated to Penicillin G. An
Infectious Disease consult was obtained and they recommended
adding Clindamycin to cover toxin production. On POD #[**4-4**] she
was transferred out of the ICU to the VICU and her course
remained uncomplicated as follows:

Neuro: The patient remained neurologically intact throughout the
hospitalization. Her post-operative pain was controlled with
Ultram.

CV:  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. She was maintained on her
home cardiovascular regimen.

Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.  Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout this hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN:

Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.

The patient's diet was advanced POD# [**5-6**], which was tolerated
well.

The patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IVF
were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's electrolytes were
routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted
when necessary. Her foley was removed POD #[**5-6**] and she was
voiding without difficulty. She developed non-bloody loose
stools after starting Clindamycin. C.diff Ag was negative x2. If
she continues to have loose stools now that the Clindamycin was
discontinued she will need further workup.

ID: Intitially she was placed on Vancomycin and Zosyn. Initial
WBC was 16 and this normalized post-operatively. Cultures from
the abscess grew Group A strep and her antibiotic regimen was
changed to Penicillin G. Sensitivities are pending. She
initially had a fever to 101 on POD #1 and cultures were sent.
Urine culture was negative x2 and blood cultures were negative
from [**2193-3-9**] with no growth to date on cultures from [**2193-3-12**].
Infectious disease was consulted and Clindamycin was added. They
recommended long-term antibiotic therapy and a PICC was placed
on [**2193-3-14**]. Under guidance from ID her antibiotic regimen was
changed to Ceftriaxone 2g daily. She will continue IV
antibiotics until she follows up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2 weeks at
which point a decision will be made to continue IV antibiotic or
transition to an oral regimen. She will follow up with
infectious disease and will have weekly CBC, BUN/Cr, and LFTs
sent to the [**Hospital **] clinic. She remained afebrile thereafter.

Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
this stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required during this stay.

Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin, H2
blocker, and Aspirin during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without difficulty,
and pain was well controlled. She was discharged to rehab and
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2 weeks for a post-operative
check in addition to follow up in the [**Hospital **] clinic.
