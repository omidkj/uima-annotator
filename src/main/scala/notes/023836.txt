headache, neck pain, vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a 82 year-old RH woman w/ Afib (on coumadin),
HTN/CHF/HL/COPD who apparently had developed sudden onset R
sided
HA with pain behind the right eye with radiation to the neck and
difficulties with vision.  Apparently had called EMS herself and
was taken to [**Hospital **] hospital where on initial evaluation was
noted to have BP of 175/89, exam notable for being alert,
oriented, following commands and moving extremities
symmetrically
and to have a visual field cut.  She underwent a CT head w/
showed a R P/O 5.8x2.9 cm hemorrhage w/ surrounding edema.  INR
was 2.0.  She was given 10mg SC of Vitamin K, 2U FFP, 1g of
fosphenytoin and zofran.  She had subsequently developed
hypotension reportedly to 60s systolic and required Dopamine
temporarily.  She was not febrile.  Given ICH, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and was intubated prior to [**Last Name (un) 62483**] and
sedated w/ versed.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], VS were [**Age over 90 **]F 155/97 90 14 on CMV/AC.  She
was
awake, sleepy but arousable and following commands (see exam
below).  She received versed 2mg prior to repeat CT and was
restarted on gtt. Pt. also received 30U PCC.

and right thumbs, lifts both [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 85903**], points to

examiner only when on the right.  Reaches across to left side to

arm to request to lift L arm, however on tactile pointing to
left, will lift left arm.

formally.
III, IV, VI: No eye deviation, EOMI though would close eyes
before completely moved to each extreme.
V: intact to LT (nods for touch)
VII: No facial droop, facial musculature symmetric, though
intubated.
VIII: did not test.
IX, X: positive cough on demand.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii bilaterally.

TTE [**2126-2-20**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection
fraction 30 percent) secondary to extensive severe anterior and
apical hypokinesis/akinesis, and hypokinesis of the septum and
inferior free wall. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT head [**2126-2-20**]
IMPRESSION: Large right occipitoparietal lobar hemorrhage with
surrounding
edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricle, unchanged over
the short-
interval. No shift of midline structures, or transtentorial or
uncal
herniation.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: Also demonstrated is a very
small amount of
subarachnoid hemorrhage, localized in the immediately-overlying
parietovertex
sulci. In the context of the acute lobar hemorrhage (as well as
the patient's
advanced age), this finding - which raises the possibility of
associated pial
vessel involvement - is strongly suggestive of underlying
amyloid angiopathy.

Liver ultrasound [**2126-2-20**]
Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Note, other
more severe
forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be
excluded on
this study.

CT head [**2126-2-20**]

IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in right occipital hemorrhage with
persistent 2 mm
shift towards the left. Small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage
is also
stable. No new hemorrhage is identified.
2. Small calcified meningioma, stable in the left frontoparietal
region.

MRI/A
No iv contrast, giving suboptimal evaluation for mass. There is
a saccular 4 mm aneurism at the bifurcation of L MCA, with
vessels arrising.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 65763**] is an 82 year-old woman w/ Afib (on coumadin),
