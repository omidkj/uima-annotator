Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4071**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization [**2146-12-23**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14966**] is a 60-year-old man with history of severe dilated
cardiomyopathy (EF 10-15%, non-ischemic, likely familial) status
post ICD implantation with a biventricular upgrade in [**12/2145**],
amiodarone induced pneumonitis, multiple DVTs, chronic atrial
fibrillation,HTN, HLD, DM2, who was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] [**2146-12-13**] for ICD firing/V.Fib, and after attempting
several anti-arrhythmics, was eventually discharged on
quinidine. Seroquel was discontinued at that time due to its
arrythmogenic potential.
.
He developed constant dyspnea soon after discharge (about 10
days ago) occurring at rest and limiting his mobility to just a
few steps. This was accompanied by 2-pillow orthopnea and
frequent nightly episodes of PND limiting sleep. He notes
consistent compliance with all his meds, including his
diuretics, and denies dietary indiscretions. His appetite was
rather limited, in actuality. He is on chronic home 02 at 2L,
which he increased to 3L He has had multiple admissions in the
past few years for CHF exacerbation, and notes that his current
symptoms feel similar.
.
He also endorses consistent nausea over the past 10 days which
had been progressive, limiting his appetite, and resulting in
[**1-29**] daily episodes of dry-heaving. His symptoms seem to have
improved within the past 2-3 days, corresponding to a decreased
dose of quinidine.
.
While he denies chest pain, he does endorse a several year
history of intermittent chest pressure, occuring once a month.
The sensation is substernally localized with a [**Doctor Last Name **] sign,
though dissipates within 20 seconds, and is unrelated to
exertion. It does not radiate, and is unacompanied by
diaphoresis, anxiety, or dyspnea. He is currently chest
pain-free.
.
He has a history of multiple PE and DVT, but denies calf
tenderness, pleuritic chest pain, palpitations, or lower
extremity edema.
.
In the ED, his vital signs were 98 82 130/81 100% on 2L. His
examination was significant for a lack of JVD, crackles, or
lower extremity edema. His CXR demonstrated no congestion,
though a BNP was elevated at 6655. EKG demonstrated only Afib,
ventricular paced with PVCs. BP was running low in the upper
90's after giving anti-hypertensives that were missed that
morning.
.
On arrival to the floor, his vital signs were T=100.3 BP= 97/55
HR= 81 RR= 22 O2 sat= 97%2L.  He was comfortable in NAD.
Complaining only of some mild lower back pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On general review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, current myalgias, joint pains, cough, sputum,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.

an ankle trauma, and second episode of PE in [**2137**]. IVC filter
placed [**2137**]. Also had a right brachial vein DVT in [**2139**].
.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
- lap cholecystectomy [**2-/2144**]

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
 use. Quit smoking 7 years ago after smoking for 40 years x

plant making latex.


Family History:
There is family history of premature coronary artery disease in
patient's father, who had first MI at age 37. He had several
heart attacks, the second occuring in his 40s. Mother also has
dilated cardiomyopathy. Sister had ?[**Name2 (NI) 41267**] CMY (1 episode of
heart failure when very emotional and sad)

RIGHT CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2146-12-23**]:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right
heart filling pressures. The RVEDP was 16mmHg. The mean PCW was
31 in a tracing with come PA pressure artifact. The cardiac
output was 4.0L/min and cardiac index 2.0 L/min/m2 using the
Fick method assuming arterial oxygen saturation from peripheral
oximetry and mean arterial pressure from cuff pressures. The
oxygen consumption was assum
