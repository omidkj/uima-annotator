Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin / Ibuprofen

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
ASA desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization with placement of drug-eluting stent to
Right Coronary Artery
Aspirin desensitization


History of Present Illness:
72 y/o M with hypertension and asthma referred for aspirin
desensitization prior to cardiac catheterization [**5-7**]. He
describes taking aspirin many years ago in the hospital and
having throat swelling and shortness of breath. He gets similar
symptoms with ibuprofen. He does not get hives or itching.
 He has had recent intermittent episodes of
substernal/midepigastric discomfort described as gas pain,
lasting ~3 hrs., associated with belching, and relieved by TUMS.
No associated dizziness, lightheadedness, diaphoresis,
palpitations, shortness of breath, or vomiting. No component of
exertion or position. No orthopnea, PND, or edema. Symptoms
evaluated with ETT-MIBI [**5-5**] during which he exercised for 4:37
reaching 7 METS and 91% of max predicted HR. At peak exercise he
had chest discomfort with 2-[**Street Address(2) 82585**] depressions
inferiolaterally and ventricular ectopic activity with couplets
- chest pain resolved with NTG. Initial images showed inferior
defect. Also had asymptomatic 4-beat run of VT in immediate
post-recovery period. TTE [**5-6**] showed normal LV size and
systolic function (LVEF 65%), 2+ MR, 1+ TR, and trace AR.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools.  He denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative except as noted above.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Chest X-ray:  Normal heart, lungs, hila, mediastinum and pleural
surfaces aside from a descending thoracic aorta, which is at
least tortuous and may be mildly dilated. Conventional
radiographs recommended for initial assessment

Cardiac cath:(Prelim report)
Initial angiography showed 80% mid RAC and 50% distal RCA at
crux. We
planned to treat the mid RCA lesion with PTCA and stenting.
Bivaliruding
provided adequate support. The patient also received ASA and
Plavix
prior to the procedure. A 6 French JR4 guide provided adequate
suport.
Choice Floppy wire crossed the lesion without dufficulty and was

positioned in the distal RPDA. A 3.0x12 mm Quantum Maverick RX
predilated the lesion at 18 ATM. We then deployed a 3.0x15 mm
Endeavor
stent RX at 16 ATM. Final angiography showed 0% residual
stenosis with
TIMI 3 flow and no dissection or distal emboli. We then
successfully deployed a 6 French Angioseal closure device into
the RCFA.
The patient left the carth lab free from angina and in stable
condition.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

demonstrated two-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
no
significant stenoses.  The LAD had sequential 50% stenoses in
the mid-
and distal-vessel.  The LCX had mild insignificant plaque.  The
RCA had
an 80% mid-vessel stenosis and a 50% stenosis at the PDA/PLV
bifurcation.
2.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated high-normal biventricular
filling
pressures and mild pulmonary arterial hypertension as above.
3. Successful PTCA and stening of the mid RAC with 3.0x15 mm
Endeavor
DES. Final angiography showed 0% residual stenosis with TIMI 3
flow and
no dssection or distal emboli.
4. Successful deployment of a 6 French Angioseal closure device
to the
RCFA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid RCA with Endeavor
DES.
3. Successful deployment of 6 French Angoseal device to the
RCFA.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 72 M w/ HTN, CRI, asthma, and nasal polyps referred prior
to cardiac catheterization for ASA desensitization following a
positive ETT. He has Samter's syndrome given h/o asthma, nasal
polyp's and aspirin allergy. He underwent aspirin
desensitization per protocol and tolerated this well. It was
emphasized he will need to consistently and reliably take an
aspirin daily and that if he misses a dose, he could potentially
have an adverse reaction such as anaphylaxis to aspirin or
NSAID's.
.
Regarding his CAD, inferolateral EKG changes with exercise and
preliminary MIBI images, isolated inferior Q on ECG suggest LCx
vs. RCA disease. He was hydrated for cardiac catherization and
pre=treated with mucomyst for renal protection given his history
of chronic renal insufficiency. He then underwent cardiac cath
which showed 50% stenoses in the mid and distal LAD, LCX with
mild insignificant plaque and RCA with an 80% mid-vessel
stenosis and a 50% stenosis at the PDA/PLV bifurcation. He
underwent placement of a drug eluting stent in his RCA. No
complications form the catheterization procedure. He was started
on full dose aspirin and plavix and was continued on these
medications at time of discharge.
