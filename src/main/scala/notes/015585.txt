HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 55 year old
male with a history of end state renal disease who was
admitted from [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2154-8-31**], with
acute shortness of breath, chest pain and hypoxia.  He was
saturating 70% on room air, and was put on 100%
non-rebreather and was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], oxygen
saturation was 40% on 100% non-rebreather.  The patient then
went into cardiac and respiratory arrest with ventricular
tachycardia.  He underwent defibrillation three times,
received amiodarone, and was intubated and transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

Potassium was 6.3 on admission, and EKG revealed peaked T
waves.  Chest x-ray showed florid pulmonary edema.  He was
initially placed on a Nitroglycerin drip, given 4 mg of
morphine, one ampule of calcium gluconate, 10 units of
insulin intravenously with one ampule of D50 and Lasix 200 mg
intravenously.

The patient's wife reports that he does not comply with his
diet.  His two past episodes of congestive heart failure have
been secondary to dietary noncompliance and difficulty
adhering to his fluid restriction.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient had troponin peaking
at 0.16, which was attributed to recent cardiac
defibrillation.

The Renal Service got involved and dialyzed about two to
three liters off on [**9-2**].  The patient spiked a fever to
101.0 F., on [**9-2**], with a urinalysis with six to ten
white blood cells and moderate bacteria.  Zosyn was started.
A chest x-ray was questionable for aspiration pneumonia.

During his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay, the patient was
transiently on Dopamine which was attributed to sedation and
hypotension with propofol.  The patient self-extubated
himself on [**9-3**] and has been stable from the hemodynamic
and respiratory standpoint.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The impression was that
this is a 55 year old male with end-stage renal disease on
hemodialysis secondary to diabetes mellitus with congestive
heart failure who was admitted secondary to dietary and fluid
indiscretion with the most recent of several congestive heart
failure type exacerbations in between dialysis sessions and
also with hyperkalemia, again likely secondary to
indiscretion leading to severe shortness of breath, cardiac
arrest, intubation.

The patient was extubated with stable blood pressure, and was
being dialyzed down to his dry weight of 65.5 kilograms and
to a potassium in the normal range.  The patient had a
troponin leak associated with his cardiac arrest and
defibrillation.

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was followed by
the Renal Team and was dialyzed down to his dry weight.  On
the day of discharge, he was no longer hypoxic.  He had
decreased crackles on lung examination.

In terms of his anti-hypertensive regimen, the patient was
discharged on Metoprolol 100 mg twice a day, Norvasc 10 mg q.
day and Losartan 100 mg q. day.  Hydralazine was held on
discharge and is to be reinstituted later on an outpatient
basis.

2.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE:  The patient was dialyzed down
to his dry weight.  He was continued on Renagel and
Nephrocaps.

3.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient intermittently was
spiking fevers during his hospital stay.  He was initially
started on Zosyn to cover for a possible aspiration pneumonia
and urinary tract infection; however, towards the end of his
hospitalization he was afebrile.  As a source of his fevers
were unclear and he was no longer febrile, the Zosyn was
stopped.  Blood cultures and urine cultures remained negative
and white blood cell count was stable.

4.  ENDOCRINE, DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  The patient was
restarted on his NPH 7 units q. a.m. along with Regular
insulin sliding scale and fingersticks four times a day.
Glycemic controls remained within normal range throughout
hospital stay.

For hyperparathyroidism, a PPH was rechecked during the
hospital stay and was 1131.  The patient was continued on
Renagel.  He is to follow-up as an outpatient for a
parathyr
