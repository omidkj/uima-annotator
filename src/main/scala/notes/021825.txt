Service:  [**Last Name (un) **]


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was an 83-year-old
female with a past medical history notable for ischemic bowel
status post total colectomy and resection of one-third of her
small bowel in [**2200-3-25**], cholecystectomy for acute
cholecystitis in [**2200-9-25**], VRE UTI, coronary artery
disease status post RCA stent x 2, and a non-ST elevation MI
in [**2203**], with a recent hospitalization in [**2204-10-25**].

In [**2204-11-25**], the patient had urosepsis and pneumonia. She
presented on the day of admission to the [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] after being found unresponsive to
the nursing home. Per EMS records, she was found lethargic
and cyanotic with cold extremities on rounds there. Her heart
rate was in the 40s. Respiratory rate was in the 30s. Blood
pressure was in the 50s systolic.

Upon presentation to the [**Hospital6 2018**], she received approximately 9 L of intravenous fluids,
3 units of packed red blood cells and was placed on Levophed
drip. She was also started on broad-spectrum antibiotics in
the form of vancomycin, imipenem and Flagyl. She was sedated,
intubated and transferred to the surgical ICU with 500 cc of
red brown output.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ischemic bowel, short-gut syndrome,
acute cholecystitis, VRE UTI, Klebsiella UTI, hypertension,
COPD, CAD status post 2 stents to the RCA, non-ST elevation
MI in [**2203**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Total colectomy, cholecystectomy,
thyroidectomy.

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. daily,
Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Atrovent nebulizers, albuterol
nebulizers, Prilosec, ranitidine, Ambien, Maalox, Flovent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Temperature 97.8, the
lowest being 90, heart rate 144, blood pressure 99/43 on
Levophed and Pitressin drips, respiratory rate 12, 92% on
maximal ventilator support, FIO2 100% assist-control
ventilation. General: She was minimally responsive. Abdomen:
Ostomy had dark red blood. The abdomen itself was soft,
distended and relatively firm.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 32,000, hematocrit
40.9, 93% neutrophils; creatinine 1.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the intensive
care unit. The remainder of this dictation will be presented
in a system space format.

Neurologic: She was sedated using Fentanyl. Head CT scan was
obtained which revealed a questionable small frontal infarct
but no other mass or lesion.

Cardiovascular: She required maximal support with Levophed
and Pitressin throughout the intensive care unit admission to
maintain her support.

Respiratory: She required assist-control ventilation. She
developed an ARDS picture with an FIO2 requirement of 100%.
This was gradually weaned through her intensive care stay.

GI: She was maintained NPO and started on total parenteral
nutrition.

GU: In consultation with the renal service, the patient's
renal status was reasonable. Initially she had some polyuria,
but her urine status seemed to normalize. She also had a
significant lactic acidosis which only mildly improved.

Hematologic: The patient required transfusions of platelets
for a low platelet count. Hematology/oncology service was
also consulted for her thrombocytopenia. FFP was given for a
mild coagulopathy with elevated PT and INRs.

Infectious disease: She was kept on vancomycin, Imipenem and
Flagyl. She had no obvious source of infection, although her
urine did have E. Coli. The ostomy output continued to be
slightly bloody throughout the admission.

Tubes, lines and drains: She had a central catheter inserted
by the surgical intensive care team.

Prophylaxis: She was placed on Protonix. A HIT panel was sent
which was negative, although her platelets remained low
throughout the admission.

Endocrine: She was maintained on insulin drip for proper
glycemic control. The patient's electrolytes were followed
closely, and she maintained on maintenance fluid for
hydration.

The patient's status did not improve as the admission
progressed despite maximal vasopressor support. After a
detailed discussion between the attending surgeon and the
[**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxy, it ws decided to make the patient
comfort measures only.

On [**3-12**], the vasopressor support was stopped. The patient
was made comfortable with morphine and Fentanyl. She expired
at 1:13 p.m. on [**3-12**].
