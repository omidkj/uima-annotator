Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Incarcerated obstructed paraesophageal hernia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Left thoracotomy with extensive intrapleural lysis of
    adhesions.
2. Thoracoabdominal repair of incarcerated paraesophageal
    hernia with reduction of gastric volvulus.
3. Repair of esophagotomy and gastrotomy.
4. Dor fundoplication.
5. Feeding jejunostomy.
6. Drainage gastrostomy.
7. Diagnostic esophagoscopy.
8. Bronchoscopy with aspiration of secretions.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is unfortunate 41-year-old
gentleman with Marfan syndrome status post extensive aortic
dissection who has had multiple vascular procedures including
de-branching of the head vessels which are now fed with new
grafts from the ascending aorta and the femoral axillary
graft with Endo grafting of the ascending aorta, arch and
descending aorta, de-branching of the visceral aorta with
static grafting and extra-anatomic reconstruction of both
renal arteries, the celiac access and superior mesenteric
artery. About 10 months ago he presented with spontaneous
rupture of the esophagus and underwent a very complex repair
of the left thoracotomy with primary repair buttressed by
gastric fundus and transposition of the omentum. He had a
very long convalescence but eventually did well. He recently
returned to the hospital with evidence of herniation of the
entire stomach into the chest with organoaxial volvulus and
obstruction. After careful radiographic and endoscopic
evaluation it was recommended that he undergo a thoracoabdominal
repair of this. Given the prior Boerhaave contamination of
the left pleural space it was expected that there may be
extensive adhesions and
 a transthoracic approach was necessary. It was
unclear prior to surgery whether we would perform separate
thoracotomies and laparotomy or one thoracoabdominal
incision. This decision was deferred to the time of surgery.
The patient agreed to this treatment plan.


Past Medical History:
-Marfan Syndrome

ascending, arch, and descending aorta with right axillary -
femoral bypass grafting and reconstruction of innominate and
left carotid artery [**3-25**]; s/p visceral debranching procedure &
infrarenal aortobi-iliac graft [**6-26**]
-Boerhaave's esophageal rupture s/p repair [**11-25**]
-aortic dissection s/p aortic valve replacement & ascending
aorta replacement [**5-24**]
-h/o post-op DVT
-h/o post-op A-fib
-asthma
-GERD
-hiatal hernia, s/p hernia repair,
-s/p foot surgery

Social History:
Denies tobacco. Admits to occasional ETOH. He is married and
lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] is an electrical engineer.


Family History:
Denies connective tissue disorders. No history of premature CAD.

Physical Exam:
general: well appealing thin male in NAD
HEENT: unremarkable
chest:CTA Bilat
cor: RRR S1, S2
abd: soft, Nt, Nd, +Bs
extrem: no C/C/E
neuro: intact

Pertinent Results:
barium swallow [**2155-10-28**]:
No obstruction or extravasation. Luminal irregularity of the
distal esophagus in region of fundoplication likely represents
postoperative edema. Correlate clincially.

CXR [**10-27**] 07
Free air is still seen under the right hemidiaphragm. A very
small left apical pneumothorax is again noted.

A left chest tube is present at the base. Mediastinal changes
are essentially unaltered. Atelectasis of the left base is again
seen. The right lung remains clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
pt was taken to the OR on [**2155-10-21**] for repair of an incarcerated
hernia via the following procedures: Left thoracotomy with
extensive intrapleural lysis of
    adhesions, Thoracoabdominal repair of incarcerated
paraesophageal hernia with reduction of gastric volvulus, Repair
of esophagotomy and gastrotomy, Dor fundoplication, Feeding
jejunostomy, Drainage gastrostomy, Diagnostic esophagoscopy,
Bronchoscopy with aspiration of secretions.
OR course was w/o complications. Pt had a 2 chest tubes for
drainage, a g-tube and a J-tube. Post operatively, pt remained
intubated was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and management.

POD#1 pt was extubated w/o difficulty. Rec'd 2UPRBC for post
anemia.
POD#2 trophic J-tube feeds started. g-tube remains to gravity
d/t high vol output>1L/24hr period.
POD#3 pt transferred from ICU to floor for ongoing post op care.
POD#4 apical chest tube removed w/ stable CXR.
POD#[**5-25**] Tube feeds gradually increased to goal and is [**Last Name (un) 1815**]
well. Good bowel function. Gastric tube still w/ high vol output
~1 liter/24hrs.
Remaining chest tube d/c'd w/ stable CXR.
POD#7 passed barium swallow w/slow but complete passage of
barium into the stomach- see results section.
POD#8 cleared by PT for d/c to home w/ VNA for supportive
services.
