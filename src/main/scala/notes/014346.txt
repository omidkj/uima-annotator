History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with PMH of Parkinson's disease, [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body Dementia, CVA,
CAD and systolic CHF presented to OSH with worsening dyspena.
Three days prior to presentation, patient was found choking
during lunch, and since then has complained of something stuck
in her throat.  On day of presentation, she began to complain of
increasing pain in her throat and productive cough.  Her
breathing became more labored, she became hypoxic to 88-93% on
RA.  She denied chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, or
syncope.  At OSH, EGD was performed and found extensive
vegetable matter ahering to the wall of the esophagus, and
attempts to break up the vegetable matter or to push the matter
through to the stomach were unsuccessful.  There was a question
of a patch or a polyp in the stomach that was not biopsied.
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up of food
impaction.
Of note, at OSH, she was also noted to have b/l pleural
effusions, decreased since exam of [**2142-5-20**] as well as RLL PNA
for which she received IV Unasyn.  She had a BNP elevation to
1063, elevated troponin to 0.57, then 0.63, and then back down
to 0.49.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], patient went directly to endoscopy, where the
esophagus was found to be covered with food, not all of which
could be removed.  Layers of food were taken off of the upper
esophagus, and an ulcer was found at the GE junction, that based
on the induration, appeared to be chronic.  The lining
epithelium was completely gone.  The endpoint of the ulcer could
not be visualized, so it is unknown if the ulcer had perforated.

.
On arrival to the ICU, patient's vitals were 70s/50s, HR 70s, so
she was started on phenylephrine 2mcg/kg/min.  Her blood
pressures subsequently rose to 124/60.  The remainder of her
vitals were: T98.4  HR73  BP124/60 RR15 O2sat 100%(intubated.)

Imaging:
CXR ([**7-18**]):  Comparison is made with prior study performed a day
earlier.
The patient has been extubated. A right PICC tip is in the
cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium. Bilateral medial
radiolucencies are likely
bilateral pneumothoraces unchanged from prior study. There is a
questionable pneumopericardium. Increased withening of the left
hemithorax suggests loss of volume of the left lung likely
collapsing the left lower lobe. Bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged. A right lower lobe opacity is stable, could be
atelectasis or aspiration. Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards
the left side. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated.

Discharge Labs:

Brief Hospital Course:
## Esophageal perforation: Ms. [**Known lastname 106778**] was admitted for worsening
dyspnea and dysphagia, found to have food impaction along the
esophagus, with an ulcer and possible tear at the GE junction.
Immediately following the procedure, the patient was transferred
to the ICU for hypotension and inability to extubate. She was
briefly placed on pressors, and following their discontinuation
concern for accurate BP monitoring lead to placement of an
arterial line. This revealed she was hypertensive (rather than
hypotensive). She was extubated on [**2142-7-17**]. A PICC line was used
for hydration and medication administration.  This migrated and
was repositioned twice. Following discovery of food impaction in
the esophagus, the patient was made strictly NPO. CXR revealed
pneumomediastinum, likely due to a small perforation at the GE
junction.  Repeat EGD was considered too risky, and it was
determined that the lesion should be allowed to heal
spontaneously. PPN was started for nutrition. Although the
patient had expressed a wish to avoid tube feeding, in this case
it was accepted as it may be a short-term intervention that will
support the healing of the ulcer at the GE junction. She was
evaluated by Thoracic Surgery, who believed that she was not a
surgical candidate. She was made strict NPO , and was placed on
TPN. GI recommended a repeat endoscopy planned for [**8-6**] to
evaluate the status of the ulcer, given the patient and family's
hope that she would be able to take oral nutrition. The patient
had previously deferred other forms of feeding, per her family.
Currently she will be continued on TPN until the ulcer can be
further evaluated.  Please continue checking BMP, ca, mag and
phos to adjust TPN daily.
.
## Aspiration pneumonia: CXR revealed a likely RLL pneumonia
consistent with aspiration. In the ICU, she was given
Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl to cover HCAP, which was
transitioned to Vancomycin and Zosyn. She had a increase in her
wbc, but cultures were negative.  ID recommended broadening to
micafungin and flagyl(for c.diff coverage).  Blood, urine, stool
and thoracentesis cultures with no growth to date.  Zosyn,
micafungin and vanco are to be continued until [**8-1**] and flagyl
should be continued until [**8-3**].  Vanco trough should be checked
daily to dose vanco with goal 15-20. This was also complicated
by the fact that she had a pneumomediastinum, as well as
possible acute CHF.  Her o2 requirements improved, decreased to
2.5L on day of discharge.
.
## Acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure: She was
noted to have pleural effusions, which was likely due to volume
overload and uncontrolled hypertension. This was effectively
treated with small doses of IV Lasix. She developed flash
pulmonary edema on [**2142-7-19**] in the setting of SBP 210, which
improved w/ IV Lasix, Morphine, and Nitro paste.  Symptoms
improved and trop were neg.  no further issues.
.
## HTN: BP was quite elevated in the ICU requiring A-line for
accurate monitoring. Since she was NPO, she was given IV
Metoprolol 5mg Q6H with fair BP control.  ACE held as pt could
not
