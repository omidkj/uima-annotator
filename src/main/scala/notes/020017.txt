PERTINENT LABS:
SPEP - no abnormalities
UPEP - multiple protein bands, no monoclonal immunoglobulin,
negative for bence-[**Doctor Last Name 49**] protein

Imaging:
CXR: [**2108-12-3**]
In comparison with study of [**2108-4-5**], there is some enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette with mild indistinctness of pulmonary
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Probable bilateral
pleural effusions. Minimal atelectatic changes at the bases. The
relative
discordance between the cardiac size and pulmonary vascularity
raises the
possibility of underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial
effusion.

ECHO: [**2108-12-6**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A septal occluder device is seen across the
interatrial septum with small amount of persistent interatrial
shunting (direction of the shunt difficult to pinpoint based on
this study). . A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.
Left ventricular wall th
