fever, chills, cough
.
HPI: Mrs [**Known lastname 732**] is at 64 yo female with pmh of DM, htn, s/p CVA,
OSA, and asthma who was admitted to the MICU due to somulence
and concern for sepsis. The week prior to admission she
developed a sore throat and productive cough which caused her to
use her albuterl inhaler more frequently. Then the day prior to
admission she developed fever (to 103.4 at home), chills, and
urinary symptoms (dysuria, incontinence and frequency). She did
report several family members with viral illnesses.
.
In the ED she was febrile to 102.9 and tachycardic with HR in
the 120's to 130's. She required 4 L of oxygen to maintain her
sats in the mid 90's. She was cultured and started on
levofloxacin and vancomycin for PNA, although her CXR showed no
infiltrate. She was also given IVF. She remained tachycardic and
was noted to become somulent (although her ABG showed 7.41/46/81
on 4L) so she was admitted to the MICU.
.
Vanc was continued in the MICU and levofloxacin was changed to
zosyn due to concern for sepsis. She was also started on
oseltamivir due to concern for flu. In the MICU a DFA was sent
and was negative for flu. Swine flu confirmatory testing is
pending at the state lab. Urinary leginella also returned
negative. Patient also has a history of chronic skin ulcers on
her chest, leg, and vulva. These were considered as a possible
source of infection so her antibiotics have been continued.
During her MICU stay her tachycardia resolved and she was weaned
off oxygen, currently sattnig normally on RA.
.
Currently she denies pain or SOB at rest, but admits to SOB with
exertion. Had been constipated until today when she developed
diarrhea. Denies abdominal pain. She has been afebrile since
admission to the MICU.
.
ROS: Denies night sweats, headache, vision changes, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, hematuria.

CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there are no
relevant
changes. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the upper
range of normal.  There is no evidence of focal parenchymal
opacities suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions, no
evidence of overhydration.

MICROBIOLOGY:
BCx x 2 ([**6-1**])- NGTD
DFA ([**6-1**]) - negative
UCx ([**6-1**]) - NGTD
Ulegionella Ag - negative
BCx ([**6-2**]) - NGTD
.
STUDIES:
CXR ([**6-1**]): No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Stable
enlargement of both hila. No evidence of congestive heart
failure.
.
CXR ([**6-2**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, there are no
relevant changes. The size of the cardiac silhouette is at the
upper range of normal. There is no evidence of focal parenchymal
opacities suggesting pneumonia. No pleural effusions, no
evidence of overhydration.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo F with a history of morbid obesity, HTN, DM2, chronic skin
ulcers, who presents with fevers, chills, shortness of breath,
and cough.
.
# Sepsis: patient with fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia. Patient
with three criteria for SIRS and potential pulmonary source of
infection. Patient has WBC of 16.5 with left shift but no bands.
In the setting of fevers, chills, dysuria, and cough, concerning
for infectious etiology likely pneumonia. CXR w/o overt
infiltrate however patient has cough, productive sputum. Viral
potential but bacterial etiology possible. Given symptoms of
dysuria, frequency, and incontinence, assessment made for UTI.
Physical exam without CVA tenderness. Patient has hydradenitis,
which may be a source of infection and abscess. No history of
diarrhea.Influenza antigen test sent in ED. Given possibility of
H1N1 Influenza, treated empirically with oseltamavir pending
antigen testing. Pt. placed on droplet precautions, sputum
culture, blood culture, urine legionella sent, and patient
placed on vanc/levo empirically for abx.  Pt. afebrile and
eventually ruled out for the flu.  Her CXR was without evidence
of infection and her antibiotics were stopped.
.
# Hypoxia: unclear if primary related to pulmonary infection.
Sinus tachycardia. Fever. No infiltrate on CXR. Family with
viral illness, placed on vanc/levo with work as above.
.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3. Cr on
admission 1.5. Likely prerenal in the setting of viral or
bacterial infection. Patient received 1.5L of IV fluids in ED
with a resultant decrease in Cr.
.
# Wound Care:  Patient with several wounds in her pannicular
grooves an labia, not purulent, but draining clear liquid with
occasional blood.  Wound care consult placed, in addition,
general surgery consult placed given history of these wounds
being followed by general surgery.
.
# Tachycardia: HR to 130s in ED, unresponsive to IV fluids,
though in the setting of fever. This was likely secondary to
fever, and infectious syndrome.
.
# Lactic acidosis: Lactate 2.1. Differential includes tissue
hypoperfusion in the setting of sepsis. Patient denies abdominal
pain. No anion gap.
.
# Microcytic Anemia: HCT 33.1. Baseline HCT 36-37. BP stable. No
active signs of bleeding. On coumadin for CVA with mild
supratherapeutic INR to 3.4. Unlikely source of tachycardia.
Hemolysis and Iron deficiency labs sent.
.
# Somnolence: Patient thought to be somnolent in ED. ABG was
reassuring for no acute hypercarbia. Appeared talkative and
alert in the MICU. Potentially related to fever, i
