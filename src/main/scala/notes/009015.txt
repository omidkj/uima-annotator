Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Hip fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left hemiarthroplasty
Upper endoscopy (EGD) x2
Central venous catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] is an 85 year-old woman with ESRD on HD, PAD s/p RLE
stent on Plavix, HTN, DM2 admitted with left femoral neck
fracture after mechanical fall on [**2185-10-11**], now POD4 s/p left
hip hemiarthroplasty. On the day of mechanical fall, the patient
had just returned home from rehab, following a recent admission
to the MICU for flash pulmonary edema [**Date range (1) 57958**]/[**2185**]. She denied
any lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, visual changes before
and after the fall. She was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and CT
showed signal irregularity in the area of the left femoral neck
fracture, concerning for pathologic lesion. She was initially
medically optimized and then underwent left hip
hemiarthroplasty, and an area of ??????unusual-looking collapsed
comminuted fracture?????? was biopsied, pathology results pending.

The patient was recovering well following her operation and her
diet was advanced, but she had a sensation of food becoming
stuck in her chest and small episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody
emesis nearly every time she tried to eat. She denies any
associated nausea, odynophagia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. She
had been having normal BMs but noted that she had dark red blood
per rectum x2. She denies any associated pain, urgency, or
diarrhea, and reports the BMs felt normal to her but looked
bloody. She feels more fatigued today and has had minimal
ambulation due to left hip pain. She denies lightheadedness,
dizzinesss, chest pain, or dyspnea. She has had a ~10-lb weight
loss over the past 3 months, which she attributes to dialysis
and dietary modifications. Her last EGD in [**7-/2183**] showed chronic
antral gastritis with intestinal metaplasia and esophageal ring
at GEJ with small hiatal hernia. She reports having a
colonoscopy at an unknown OSH ~2 years ago, and her last
colonoscopy at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**9-/2179**] showed sigmoid diverticulosis.
The patient denies any previous hematemesis, hematochezia, or
melena. She takes ASA 81mg Daily and Plavix 75mg Daily at home,
and denies use of NSAIDs or other anticoagulants at home. She
was started on ASA, Plavix, and Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous
on admission, and also Coumadin 5mg Daily on [**2185-10-15**] for DVT
ppx. Coumadin and Heparin were discontinued when her Hct
decreased from 25.3 to 20.6 and she was noted to have
supratherapeutic INR 3.8, which peaked to 6.5. Hct rose to 22.5
with 1u PRBC, then 22.9 with another 1u PRBC. ASA and Plavix
were following dark red, foul-smelling BMs and continued Hct
drop, now at 19.2 despite 4 units PRBC today. In all, the
patient received 4units PRBC, 2units FFP, and Vitamin K 5mg x1;
2units PRBC on [**10-17**]; 1units PRBC on [**10-15**]; and 2units PRBC on
[**10-13**].

The patient is also complaining of substernal chest pressure,
and denies pain or tightness.

EIA

EGD [**2185-10-18**]:
A 1cm red spot with oozing blood was seen in the second portion
of the duodenum. (injection, endoclip)
Erythema, congestion and friability in the whole stomach
compatible with erosive gastritis
Erosions in the antrum and pylorus
Ulcers in the antrum
Esophagitis in the lower third of the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

EGD [**2185-10-21**]: Ulcers in the lower third of the esophagus
Small hiatal hernia
Friability, congestion and erythema in the whole stomach
compatible with gastritis
An active site of bleeding was seen in the duodenal bulb.
(endoclip)
The area in the proximal second part of the duodenum that had
previously been clipped no longer had clips placed. An ulcerated
lesion was seen which was not actively bleeding. An area
adjacent to it was erythematous but after washing revealed
eroded mucosa without evidence of active or recent bleeding.
(endoclip)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year-old woman was admitted after a fall which resulted in
left hip fracture s/p left hemiarthroplasty on [**2185-10-14**]. She was
started on warfarin for post-orthopedic surgery anticoagulation.
She subsequently developed an acute drop in hematocrit and had
melena and was transferred to the ICU.  She required multiple
PRBC (13 units) and FFP (7 units).  EGD performed twice for
continuing HCT drop and found severe esophagitis with
esophageal, antral, and duodenal ulcers.  HCT remained stable
after the 2nd EGD on [**2185-10-21**]. The patient's H.pylori antibody
test was equivocal, but given the severity of her ulcer disease,
it was decided that she may benefit from H.pylori eradication
therapy.  She was transferred to rehab after 5 days of HCT
stable at 33-35.

PROBLEM LIST
# L hip fracture: Pt was admitted with L hip fracture,
concerning for pathologic fracture. She went to OR on [**2185-10-14**]
and had L hemiarthroplasty. She was started on coumadin as
prophylactic anticoagulation and developed drop in hct with
melena (further outlined below). After her GI bleed issue
resolved, she began working with physical therapy in house and
did well. Pneumoboots were used as her DVT prophylaxis. Her pain
was well controlled with around the clock tylenol. She is being
discharged to rehab.

# Large upper GI bleed: She was started on prophylactic coumadin
after her L hemiarthroplasty and developed drop in hct with
melena. She was transferred to MICU for monitoring. She
underwent EGD that showed gastric ulcer which were injected and
endoclipped, and also showed esophagitis. Post EGD, her hct
continued to trend down from 28 -> 24 and pt had continued
melena. For continued melena and hct drop, she underwent repeat
EGD that showed active bleeding site in duodenal bulb w
