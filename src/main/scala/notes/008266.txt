Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
angina with back pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization [**2108-1-17**]
cabg x3 [**2108-1-19**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is 70 yo m with h/o heavy EtOH abuse, anxiety, tobacco use,
hypercholesterolemia, who awoke on [**1-13**] with 8/10 L sided chest
pain and L mid scapular pain. He took Maalox, but the pain
continued and was described as a dull ache. + diaphoresis, but
no SOB. Had similar pain the past two night prior to admission
to OSH. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital3 1280**], and had EKG which showed
inferolateral STD. Pain improved with nitro. CK was normal, trop
indeterminate. He was given ASA, lovenox, integrilin gtt, and
nitro paste. Pt reportedly wanted to leave the hospital, and was
then placed on CIWA scale. Echo at OSH showed EF 15% w/ inf
akinesis, distal apex and distal anterior wall motion
abnormalities.
.
Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of cardiac
cath.
.
Pt currently has no complaints. He denies CP, back pain, SOB,
N/V, F/C.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is an inferobasal left ventricular aneurysm. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with minor regional
variation (akinetic anterolateral and anterior walls, dyskinetic
inferior base) . Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severly depressed. (LVEF >20%)
4.Right ventricular systolic function is borderline normal.
5.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. Epiaortic
scan revealed no appreciable lesions at the point of crossclamp
or aortic cannulation. There is simple atheroma in the aortic
arch and complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The posterior
leaflet is restricted in motion. Trivial regurgitation of mitral
valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST BYPASS
(The patient is receiving epinephrine infusion at 0.02
ucg/kg/min)
1.LV systolic function is marginally improved (but still severly
impaired) in the setting of low dose inotropes.
2.RV systolic function remains unchanged
3. Trace MR remains
4. Study otherwise unchanged from prebypass
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
