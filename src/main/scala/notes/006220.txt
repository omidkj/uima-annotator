CTA [**10-1**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or dissection.
2. Multifocal confluent airspace opacities, left lung greater
than right. The pattern is similar to [**2133-8-17**], and the
differential diagnosis includes atypical pneumonia, aspiration.
Less likely etiologies of pulmonary hemorrhage and drug reaction
are also possibilities.


Brief Hospital Course:
53 y.o woman with h.o MS, asthma, chronic pain who presents with
SOB/cough/ fever s/p fall.
.
# Atypical vs CAP: She presented with dyspnea on [**10-1**]. CT and
CXR of lung showed opacification of the left lung (effusion
vs.collapse), and right lung with patchy airspace opacity. CT
findings of ground glass opacities in both lungs suggested
atypical pneumonia. On [**10-3**], she was started on
Methylprednisolone 60 Q 8 and given lasix 20 IV x 1. Pt
continued to have worsening dyspnea and was intubated on [**10-3**]
until [**10-6**]. Pt's abx was broadened to Zosyn for 5 days and
after extubation, she was placed on Levaquin again by ICU to
finish a 7 day course of abx. ON floor, pt continued to have
productive cough but oxygen requirement is stable at 0 liters
and has remained afebrile. Pt finished levaquin on [**2134-10-10**]. For
ongoing cough, pt is on frequent nebs, guaifenisen, prn
suctioning and also ordered for chest PT.
.
# S/P Fall: She had a fall with no available history for
pre/post symptoms to suggest syncope from vasovagal,
orthostatic, or cardiac cause. Pt remembers the fall and she
denies pre-syncopal/syncopal sx. She thinks she tripped. She has
an L eyelid superficial lac which was steri-stripped in ICU.  CT
head and C spine are negative.

# Altered Mental Status: Pt appeared delerious upon admission.
It was believe that the pt was AOx3 at baseline, however had
been noted to be suffering from hallicinations/paranoia prior to
admission. DDx included infection, narcotic intake (although tox
negative), toxic metabolic. Pt is s/p fall but CT head/neck
negative for acute process. Following extubation on [**10-6**], the
patient's mental status cleared and she was subsequently AOx3 on
the morning of [**10-8**] and has continued to remain oriented and
calm on floor.
.
# advanced MS (multiple sclerosis). Neurology was consulted for
help on medical management, they recommended continuing all her
MS meds but they were inaccurately dosed in ICU. Home meds
reconciled with husband on [**10-9**] and except for soma, pt is on
all of her MS meds again as of [**10-9**].

# Chronic Pain: Per husband, pt is on oxycontin 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt
continued on Oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **] here with prn oxycodone and
appeared to be doing well.
