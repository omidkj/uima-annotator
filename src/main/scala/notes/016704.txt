HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 103168**] is a 75-year-old
female who presented to the emergency department complaining
of passing feces in her urine for the past two and a half
weeks.  The patient had previously seen a physician
concerning this problem and had received a CT scan on
[**2129-5-16**] that showed air in the bladder with thickening of
the right wall and fat stranding.  The patient had been
further studied with a colonoscopy notable for extensive
diverticulosis.  The patient had been initiated on
antibiotics in an attempt to treat her colovesical fistula.
She currently complained of intermittent diarrhea.  She
denied any nausea, vomiting, pain, fevers, chills, chest pain
or shortness of breath.

ALLERGIES:  The patient was allergic to erythromycin, aspirin
and colchicine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was noted to be a well nourished female in no acute distress.
Her temperature was 98.4??????F.  She had a pulse of 68, a blood
pressure of 122/52, a respiratory rate of 18 and an oxygen
saturation that was noted to be 90%.  On HEENT examination,
the head was normocephalic and atraumatic.  The heart had a
regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft.  Upon rectal
examination, the patient was noted to be guaiac negative.
She did have stool in the vault.  She was noted to be tender
in her perineum.  The extremities had 2+ dorsalis pedis
pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white blood cell count of
12,300, hematocrit of 29.5 and platelet count of 436,000.
There was a sodium of 140, potassium of 3.0, chloride of 98,
bicarbonate of 25, BUN of 24, creatinine of 1.0 and glucose
of 89.  Calcium was 9.2.  Magnesium was 1.3.  Phosphate was
2.8.  Albumin was 3.5.  Urinalysis revealed a specific
gravity of 1.019 with a pH of 5.0.  The dipstick was notable
for large amounts of blood and was positive for nitrates,
moderate bilirubin and 4.0 urobilinogen.  On microscopic
examination, the urine revealed 31 red blood cells, 580 white
blood cells, many bacteria, no yeast and less than 1
epithelial cell.  A urine culture of this was found to grow
out mixed bacterial flora of greater than three colonies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the general
surgery service.  Intravenous antibiotic therapy was
initiated with ceftriaxone and Flagyl.  The patient's
electrolyte abnormalities were repleted.  On hospital day #2,
the patient started developing profuse diarrhea and was
screened for a bacterial infection with Clostridium
difficile.  These assays turned out to be negative.

Over the ensuing six days of hospitalization, the patient was
continued on intravenous antibiotic therapy.  During this
time, she also developed a rash of her perineum, consisting
with cutaneous fungal infection.  This was worsened by the
patient's self-administration of hydrocortisone, which was
brought to her by a friend from the outside.  The patient was
advised to discontinue the hydrocortisone and was instead
started on miconazole powder with instructions to the nurses
for good perineal care.

On [**2129-5-31**], day #6 of the patient's hospitalization, she
was bowel prepped for surgery with a Neomycin base, Flagyl by
mouth, Fleet's Phospho-Soda, Dulcolax and a Fleet's enema
until cleared.  On [**2129-6-1**], the patient was taken to the
operating room for repair of her colovesical fistula.  She
received a sigmoid colectomy with a Hartmann's [**Last Name (LF) 42265**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
end-colostomy and a bladder repair.  The primary surgeon for
this case was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; however, the bladder repair was
performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] of the urology service.
Intraoperatively, it was noted that the patient did have some
runs of sinus tachycardia of unknown origin.

On the evening of postoperative day #0, the house staff was
called to the patient's bedside for tachycardia and
hypotension.  The patient was noted to have a pulse in the
130 to 140 range.  On 12 lead electrocardiogram, it was
unclear whether or not this was atrial fibrillation or sinus
tachycardia, as there were no P wave but the rhythm was
extremely regular.  In addition, the patient's blood pressure
was approximately 94/60.

The patient was given multiple fluid boluses of normal
saline, after which her blood pressure diminished to 78/40.
At this time, it was suspicious that the patient might be
having a cardiac event and she was transferred to the
surgical intensive care unit for further management.  Further
workup revealed that she had been under-resuscitated and was
also experiencing a major electrolyte abnormality.  Her
magnesium upon arrival in the surgical intensive care unit
was 0.6 and her potassium was 3.5.  It was presumed that she
had these major electrolyte losses during the diarrheal
illness that she had leading up to surgery.  This was despite
the repletion that she had received during those days.

In the surgical intensive care unit, the patient was ruled
out for a myocardial infarction with serial enzyme studies.
Her electrolytes were repleted.  On [**2129-6-2**], she was
transfused with two units of packed red blood cells for a
hematocrit of 26.9.  Her post transfusion hematocrit was
31.9.  Her INR was also noted to be 1.6 to 1.8, for which she
received multiple subcutaneous doses of vitamin K 10 mg.

On a repeat urinalysis and urine culture, the patient was
noted to have moderate yeast on microscopic examination and
her urine culture grew in excess of 100,000 units of yeast
colonies.  The patient was initiated on intravenous Diflucan
therapy after it was felt that Amphotericin bladder washes
would be harmful in site of her recent bladder repair.  She
was also continued on the ceftriaxone and Flagyl that she had
received preoperatively.

After three days in the surgical intensive care unit, the
patient was transferred back to the floor for further
management.  The remainder of her hospital stay was
relatively uneventful.  By postoperative day #5, the
patient's ostomy started to put out gas.  She was started on
sips and advanced in a normal fashion.  In addition, her
home medications were restarted without incident.  Her Foley
catheter remained in place until postoperative day #7, at
which time she had a cystogram that demonstrated no leak.
After this, the patient's Foley catheter was discontinued
without incident.

A urinalysis on spontaneous void following discontinuation of
her Foley catheter revealed clear urine with a specific
gravity of 1.006 and a pH of 7.5 that was positive only for
trace amounts of blood.  It was negative for nitrates and, on
microscopic examination, she had 11 red blood cells, 38 white
blood cells, no bacteria, no yeast and 12 epithelial cells.

DISPOSITION: On hospital day #8, [**2129-6-9**], the patient was
discharged from the hospital.  She was to receive full time
nursing care at home that was paid for on behalf of her
family.  The patient was discharged in good condition in the
care of her private nurse and was instructed to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in approximately two weeks.
