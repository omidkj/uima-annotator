Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old
Portuguese speaking female found in respiratory distress at
her nursing home.  EMS was called and vital signs at that
time were a heart rate of 112, blood pressure of 140/80;
respiratory rate of 40 and she was 71% on room air.  Rales
were noted bilaterally.  This patient is normally on two
liters of home oxygen.  She was given Nitroglycerin, 80 mg of
Lasix and morphine and nebulizers during transport; the
patient was unresponsive.  The patient, in the Emergency
Department, BiPAP ventilation was started.  The patient's
systolic blood pressure dropped to the 70s.  Dopamine was
started and titrated up to 7.5.  Blood pressure was
stabilized at systolic blood pressure of 110 and Dopamine was
weaned off later during the day.  The patient was also given
Levofloxacin 500 mg times one for possible pneumonia, and
Ceftriaxone 1 gram.  Per report at nursing home, at 04:30
p.m. the previous day, the patient had an episode of chest
pain and was given Ativan, Nitroglycerin and percocet.

On oxygen at 01:00 p.m., her O2 saturations were fine.  She
was without any complaints.  At 03:00 a.m., she desaturated
to the 70s.  No chest pain at that time.  The patient was
communicating when she left the nursing home.  At the time of
evaluation, this was unresponsive.  She grimaced only to
pain.  The family was unavailable and a message was left for
them.  Urine output was 400 cc in the Emergency Room.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 88 year old woman
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart
failure and coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction and coronary artery bypass graft who had episodes
of chest pain [**8-20**], at 04:30 p.m. which resolved with
sublingual Nitroglycerin, percocet and ativan.  The patient
was stable until 3 a.m. the morning of [**8-21**], when she
developed shortness of breath and desaturated to 70% on room
air.  Initially, she was in congestive heart failure and
diuresed and dropped blood pressure transiently and required
dopamine in the Emergency Room.  Now, on admission to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit she had diffuse wheezes, question
of pneumonia on chest x-ray.  There was a left shift and a
low grade temperature.

Concern at the time of the admission to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for an infectious process causing respiratory
failure in the setting of a patient with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.  Given chest pain yesterday and reported
congestive heart failure earlier, she also ruled out for
myocardial infarction.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia,
but chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive
heart failure likely contributing.  The patient was started
on Levofloxacin, Ceftriaxone and Flagyl to treat for nursing
home acquired pneumonia and possible aspiration.  Blood
cultures, sputum cultures were sent.  Arterial blood gas was
repeated and it was 7.21 pH, pCO2 of 108 and a pO2 of 91.
She was continued on Bi-PAP and weaned to nasal cannula
during the course of her hospital stay and within the first
12 hours, desaturated on nasal cannula 4 liters to the low
80s, and was switched to a Venturi Mask at 40%.  The family
was [**Month (only) 653**] regarding the aggressiveness of care.  The
family re-iterated to the staff that the patient is a "DO NOT
RESUSCITATE" and "DO NOT INTUBATE" and the family wished not
to have any shock electrocardioversion, or pressors used.

We continued nebs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
component.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient has known coronary
artery disease with episode of chest pain one day prior to
admission and was reported to be in congestive heart failure
overnight.  One set of cardiac enzymes were drawn before the
family was [**Name (NI) 653**].  They wished not to have any labs drawn
on the patient.  Her first set of cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable with a troponin less than 0.01.  We continued
her aspirin p.r.  The patient was unable to take p.o.
medications and so the Lipitor was held as well as the beta
blocker and ACE inhibitor.

3.  DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2:  The patient was continued on
her regular regimen of NPH and insulin sliding scale,
however, she took no p.o. during her course of stay here, so
she did not require her NPH.

4.  HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient has a history of pulmonary
embolism on Coumadin.  [**Name (NI) 263**] at the time of admission was super
therapeutic.  Coumadin was held, however, subsequent labs to
check hematocrit and [**Name (NI) 263**] were not drawn.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL/HEPATOMEGALY:  Possibly related to
congestive heart failure episode.  The patient was monitored
during the course of her stay.

7.  CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The creatinine has slightly risen
from baseline.  Her Levofloxacin was dosed renally and will
continue, however, labs were not drawn during the course of
her stay, so her creatinine was not followed
