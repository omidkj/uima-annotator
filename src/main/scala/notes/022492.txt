[**10-30**]: CT OF THE FACIAL BONES: There is moderate left
periorbital soft tissue swelling. No retrobulbar hematoma. The
globes are intact. The orbits demonstrate no fractures. The
frontal sinuses, maxillary sinuses and ethmoid air cells are
clear. There are comminuted fractures of the nasal bones
bilaterally. There is rightward nasal septal deviation and a
7-mm area of high density adjacent to the distal portion of the
nasal septum, raising the possibility of a nasal septal
hematoma. There is no significant blood or fluid within the
nasal cavity.

[**10-30**]: CT- 1. Acute L3 vertebral body compression fracture with
small paravertebral hematoma, 7 mm in diameter. No retropulsed
bony fragments or gross evidence of epidural hematoma. If there
is suspicion for acute cord injury, MRI can better delineate the
ligamentous structures and the central canal.
2. Multiple chronic and subacute rib fractures.
3. Fatty liver.

[**11-2**]: CTA-1. Patchy scattered ground-glass opacities in both
lungs are likely infectious or inflammatory, and may represent a
combination of aspiration with superimposed infection.

2. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

3. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver with multiple contour
abnormalities on the surface of the liver suggestive of early
cirrhosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER intoxicated,
tachycardic, and tremulous.  He was found to have a nasal septal
fracture, L3 compression fracture, and possible GI bleeding.
The patient was not hemodynamically stable, he was intoxicated
but appeared tremulous and to be in acute delerium tremens
despite a blood alcohol above 350 mg/dL. He was intubated to
protect his airwayand admitted to the Trauma service in the
trauma ICU.

The patient was evaluated by GI for the GI bleed who recommended
blood transfusions as needed, volume repletion, a PPI, Levaquin
for cirrhosis and portal hypertension to reduce infectious risk
and mortality, thiamine, folate, and an MVI, and evaluation of
hepatitis profile, albumin, and an ultrasound to evaluate
portal/hepatic flow.  Hepatology was also consulted who followed
during his stay.

The patient was transfused as needed throughout his hospital
stay for anemia and hemodynamic instability when appropriate.
His hematocrit was monitored frequently, and at the time of
discharge had been stable for one week with no transfusions.
The patient was given instructions to follow up with his PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**] to arrange for an outpatient colonoscopy when
appropriate.

Initially, the patient remained intubated to protect his airway
during alcohol withdrawal.  The vent was weaned as tolerated,
but the patient developed fevers on [**11-1**] for which he was
started empirically on vanc and zosyn for presumed VAP.  The
patient was bronched, and BAL Cultures were followed for
sensitivities (they grew coag + staph aureus--MRSA).  Despite
these febrile episodes, the patient did not develop
leukocytosis.  The patient was also tested for clostridium
difficil, and was found to be positive; his antibiotics were
changed to flagyl and vanco.  The patient was persistently
febrile, however, for which his lines were changed

On [**11-4**], extubation was attempted, but the patient developed
respiratory distress requiring re-intubation.  On [**11-11**], the
patient was succesfully extubated,

From a nutrition standpoint, the patient was started on tube
feeds while intubated,which were titrated up when appropriate to
goal.  Once extubated, the patient was started on a diet when
appropriate.  His diet was advanced, and the patient received
anti-emetics when necessary for nausea.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also complicated by decreasing
platelet count, for which HIT was tested, and found to be
negative.

The patient received benzodiazepines throughout his hospital
course, which were weaned slowly as indicated.  The patient's
hemodynamic instability improved with transfusions and
aggressive volume repletion.  The patient was also felt to have
rhabdomyolysis for which aggressive hydration and serial CKs and
urine myoglobin were monitored; the myoglobinuria resolved with
treatmetn.  The patient became briefly hypervolemic during his
stay for which he was diuresed when appropriate.

The patient was evaluated by ortho-spine who had the patient
fitted for a TLSO brace which he was instructed to wear when out
of bed.  The patient received physical therapy treatment and
evaluation throughout his stay.

Mr. [**Known lastname 14164**] was put on GI prophylaxis and had SCDs and SQH for
DVT prophylaxis.  He was transferred to the floor from the ICU
when the patient was stable and a bed was available.  The
patient did well on the floor with no complications.  His diet
was tolerated, the patient was urinating without a foley
catheter, he ambulated multiple times throughout the day with
the aid of physical therapy, and he continued on benzodiazepines
for DT prophylaxis, and flagyl for c.diff.  At the time of
discharge, the patient was afebrile and doing well; both he and
the team felt the patient was ready for discharge.  The patient
was seen by social work and case menagement, and was sent home
with the appropriate follow up information for discharge.  The
patient was instructed to continue all home medications, and was
given a prescription for flagyl, as well as a Valium taper.  The
team also spoke with his sister, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and his girlfriend
concerning his disposition and follow up.
