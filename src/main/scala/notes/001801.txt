IMAGING

CXR, pre-op ([**2126-12-29**]):
1. Tracheostomy cannula above the level of the clavicles within
the upper
trachea but rotated and potentially malpositioned.
2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CXR, post-op ([**2126-12-30**]):
A tracheostomy tube is in place, the tip lies approximately 16
mm above the carina. This appears to represent a change in the
tracheostomy tube compared with earlier the same day ([**2126-12-29**] at
9:59 a.m.).  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but
unchanged. Some patchy  opacity in the left greater than right
suprahilar regions is unchanged. Some  bibasilar atelectasis is
also unchanged. Prominent pulmonary artery is again noted in
this individual with history of pulmonary arterial hypertension.


Left wrist plain films ([**2126-12-30**]):
1. No obvious fracture. If there has been significant trauma and
wrist pain  persists, then followup radiographs in [**7-8**] days
could help to assess for  resorption about an occult fracture.
2. Widening and ? slight offset at the distal radioulnar joint.
This could represent a post-traumatic finding, though it is of
indeterminate acuity.
3. Possible soft tissue swelling, best assessed by physical
exam.
4. First CMC and triscaphe joint degenerative changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
60F admitted on [**2126-12-29**] for tracheostomy malfunction. The patient
was taken to the operating room and, under direct laryngoscopy,
was found to have a dislodged tracheostomy.  The tracheostomy
was replaced with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] tracheostomy piece without
complication.  The patient was subsequently admitted to the ICU
for ventilator management and close monitoring.

On hospital day #2 the patient was weaned off the ventilator to
trach collar.  Given her poor IV access, a PICC line was placed.
 She was transfused 1 unit PRBC for hematocrit 24.7, with
subsequent increase to 29.1.  Her anemia was attributed to
anemia of chronic disease given she had no evidence of active
bleeding.  Her transfusion was given in conjunction with IV
Lasix to avoid exacerbation of her congestive heart
failure/pulmonary edema.  She complained of left wrist pain, for
which plain films were obtained.  No fracture was identified.
Given her history of gout, her home allopurinol was restarted
once enteral access was obtained.

On hospital day #3 the patient went to IR for post-pyloric
advancement of a Dobhoff tube.  Nutrition was consulted with
recommendations for Replete with fiber tube feedings at a goal
of 55cc/hour.  She continued to remain stable from a hemodynamic
and respiratory standpoint and was deemed appropriate for
discharge back to rehab.
