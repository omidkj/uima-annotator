Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placed

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 56 year old female with a history of depression
who presents with dyspnea and desaturations to the 80's.  11
days ago ([**12-24**]), the patient developed diffuse myalgias,
fatigue, fevers to 102, a non-productive cough, nausea and
non-bloody non-bilious vomiting.  She also experienced decreased
appetite and had one episode of non-bloody diarrhea.  She
reports that she gets this constellation of symptoms annually
and attributes it to "the flu", although this year her symptoms
were significantly worse.  Her recent sick contacts include a
coworker with similar symptoms, and she denies any recent
travel.  She presented to the ED 8 days ago ([**12-27**]) where she had
a negative CXR and CT chest, and she was discharged with a
suspected viral infection.  However, her symptoms persisted and
she developed worsening dyspnea over the coming days.  She saw
her PCP 5 days ago ([**12-30**]) where she was found to be hypoxic to
85% on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was subsequently referred back to the ED.
.
In the ED, the patient was febrile to 100.6 and had an O2 sat of
95% on 4L NC.  She had a CXR which showed a multifocal
pneumonia, especially in the RML.  She was given nebulizers, and
started on levofloxacin ([**12-30**]) and vancomycin ([**12-31**]).  On [**1-2**], the
patient felt worn out and was found to have an O2 saturation of
87% on 2L NC, so she was put on a non-rebreather and transferred
to the MICU.  ABG at that time was 7.55/33/64 and lactate was
measured at 1.7.  Blood cultures grew out [**Last Name (LF) 8974**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was
changed to nafcillin and levofloxacin.  She denies any history
of IVDU, osteomyelitis or prostheses.  During her stay in the
MICU, the patient showed steady clinical improvement.  ECHO was
unchanged from [**2191**], and sputum gram stain was significant for
gram positive rods and cocci in pairs and clusters.  On [**1-4**] the
patient was weaned to 2L NC, saturating 92-94% with
desaturations with exertion to the high 80's but with quick
recovery.  She was transferred to the general medicine service,
where she denies feeling short of breath unless she has to talk
a lot.  She continues to suffer from laryngitis and a
non-productive cough, although she denies sore throat, and her
myalgias, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have resolved.
The patient refused nasopharyngeal aspirate because she is
"grossed out" by the description of the procedure.  She did not
receive a flu shot this year.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 56 year old female who presented with dyspnea and
hypoxemia one week after onset of diffuse myalgias,
non-productive cough, fatigue, fevers, nausea and vomiting, most
likely due to influenza leading to secondary bacterial
pneumonia.
.
1) Hypoxemia: Most likely due to Staph pneumonia superinfection
in the setting of influenza virus infection. In the ED, her
vitals were T 100.6, BP 118/61, HR 68, RR 20, O2sat 95% on 4L
NC. She has a CXR showed a mulitfocal pna especially in the RML.
She was treated with nebulizers, levofloxacin and azithromycin
in the ED and admitted.  On the floor, she was started on
Vanc/Levo ([**12-30**]).  Blood cultures grew out [**Month/Day (4) 8974**] so was changed to
Nafcillin/Levofloxacin on [**1-2**].  She had been satting 92-98% on
2L NC and became suddenly more hypoxic on [**1-2**] w/desaturation to
80s so she was put on a NRB -> satting 90% on 2 L.  ABG
7.55/33/64 on 5L NC, was transferred to MICU for respiratory
distress.  She responded well to nebulizer treatments and
nafcillin and she was transfered to the floor, a PICC line was
placed and she was discharged on nafcillin to complete a two
week course.
.
2)[**Month/Day (4) 8974**] Bacteremia: She had [**1-2**] blood culture bottles positive
for [**Month/Day (4) 8974**].  Most likely source is her bacterial pneumonia.  She
was treated as above with two week course of nafcillin.
Surveillance cultures were negative.
.
3) depression: She was continued on her outpatient regimen of
wellbutrin, ritalin and lexapro.
