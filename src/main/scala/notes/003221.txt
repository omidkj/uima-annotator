Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
88 year old female with PMH significant for HTN, DM who was
brought by EMS to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for chest pain and diaphoresis. Per
ED intake BP in field 68/p, ASA given. Patient's presenting
vitals in ED were HR 92, BP 148/91, 100 NRB, however shortly
after presentation patient became hypotensive with BP 50/30. EKG
demonstrated ST elevations lead I, lead aVL, V1, V2; ST
depression lead III, aVR. Patient was taken emergently to
cardiac cath which demonstrated thrombus with occlusion in
proximal LAD; wiring of this lesion restored flow, export
removed clot, however it traveled to LCx. Patient then began
having recurrent chest pain, respiratory distress, and
hypotension. She was intubated and an IABP was placed. A small
amount of residual thrombus remained in the LCx near the OM1. No
stents were placed as no underlying plaque apparent. Patient was
started on integrilin and heparin and transferred to the CCU for
further care.
.
While in the CCU RN noticed blood in the oropharynx, while
placing an OG patient regurgitated approximately 25 cc of bright
red blood with clots. Upon placement of OG approximately 10 cc
of bright red blood was suctioned. Patient was transfused 2
units pRBC, started on IV PPI and GI consulted. EGD demonstrated
diffuse friable mucosa with clotted blood in the lower third of
esophagus and GE junction. Blood clot felt to be partially
tamponading the bleed. For full report please see reports below.
GI recommended conservative care unless clinical picture changes
overnight.

pressures (RVEDP 7, LVEDP 5) with a mean PCWP of 6. The cardiac
output was normal at 5.5 with an SVR of 1207 and a PVR of 58.

62%
with mild mitral regurgitation and no significant wall motion
abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 88 year old female with DM, HTN who
presented with STEMI and was brought emergently to cath lab, was
transferred to the CCU following procedure with IABP given
hypotension.  Hospital course was complicated by upper GI bleed,
slow afib requiring cardiopulmonary resusitation.  The pt was
made DNR during the admission and passed on [**2130-9-5**] at 12:08 AM
while in the CCU, cause of death noted to be cardiogenic shock
following STEMI.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient presented with STEMI. During cath patient
had successful thrombectomy of proximal LAD occlusion with 20%
residual stenosis. However, developed acute occlusion of OM (due
to an embolus) treated with thrombectomy and PTCA (2.5x12mm
balloon) with a 60% residual thrombotic occlusion but
restoration of flow. Patient was unstable during procedure and
consequently was intubated and IABP placed. No stent was placed
during procedure.  She was transferred to the CCU on IABM,
integrillin, hepain.  Attempts were made to wean the balloon
pump but were unsuccessful due to hypotension.  On day 3 of the
hospitalization, family meeting was held and pt was made CMO,
IABP weaned, pt started on morphine gtt.
.
# PUMP: ECHO performed on the [**9-2**] showed EF of 30% to 35% with
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction and dilated
right ventricle with moderate regional systolic dysfunction. New
changes secondary to ACS.
.
# RHYTHM: Sinus. Patient has history of A Fib, patient
presumably on Verapamil for rate control. No anti-coagulation
had been given in the past due to prior history of GI bleed.
During this admission, she developed slow afib and the family
was called and decided to make DNR after the first code, no
escalation of care.
.
# Upper GI bleed: EGD demonstrates friable esophagus with blood
clot at GE junction. Patient's HCT and hemodynamics currently
stable. Due to ballon pump patient was initially placed on
heparin, started on IV PPI.  Crits were followed.
.
# Diabetes: Insulin sliding scale
.
# Hypertension: Outpatient Lisinopril, Lasix and Verapamil were
held due to hypotension after cath
.
# Chronic Renal Failure: Recent creatinine range as outpatient
1.3 - 1.9.  During this admission, pt developed [**Last Name (un) **] with
creatinine rising to 2.3, unclear etiology but concerning for
pre-renal vs cholesterol emboli vs contrast-induced nephropathy
(less likely due to timing of onset).
.
# Shock: on day 2 of the admission, pt developed mixed
cardiogenic/septic shock, 2 blood cxs growing gram + cocci, was
started on vanc/cefepime for broad coverage.
.
# Coagulopathy: Pt with declining platelets, hct, concerning for
DIC, platelet distruction in the setting of IABP.
.
# Asthma: Patient intubated.
.
# Gout: Hold Allopurinol in acute setting.
.
# GERD: IV PPI given UGI bleed.
