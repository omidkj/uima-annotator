Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L thoracentesis x2

History of Present Illness:
53 y/o F h/o HIV (no HAART [**4-6**] CD4 490, VL > 100K), Stage IV
NSCLC presented to the ED with SOB x10 days with progressive
DOE, orthopnea and cough productive of occasional sputum.
.
In the ED patient had CXR and CTA that demonstrated no PE, but
significant progression of disease with enlarging r-hilar mass
extending to the subcarinal area with lymphadenopathy and
metastases. Small pericardial effusion.
.
On floor patient remained hypoxic with persistent O2 requirement
of 3L. Had transient episodes of desaturation without clear
explanation. Team felt pleural effusion likely contributing to
hypoxia. Thoracentesis performed on [**5-22**] w/ removal of 1.4L of
fluid from chest and again [**5-26**] removing 1200cc of bloody fluid
w/o complication. Patient underwent pleurodesis on AM prior to
arrival in ICU.  That afternoon patient became increasingly
hypoxic with desat to 86%, tach to 120-130s. CXR looks a bit
better. Gave nebs and MSo4, ativan 1mg. On NRB now, ABG with
hypoxia. EKG unchanged.  Admitted to the ICU for mgmt of
hypoxia.
.
ROS:
(+) SOB, sick contacts
(-) F/C, N/V/D, bowel/bladder changes.

Pertinent Results:
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2115-5-20**] 10:21 PM
1. No PE.
2. Extensive progression of disease with now large left pleural
effusion, enlarging right hilar mass extending to the subcarinal
region with associated lymphadenopathy and innumerable pulmonary
metastases. Small pericardial effusion.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-5-20**] 9:02 PM
New large left pleural effusion, and associated left lower lobe
opacity which may represent atelectasis versus underlying
consolidation.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-21**] 10:55 AM
Status post thoracocentesis with decrease in left pleural
effusion and no pneumothorax.
.
# MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-5-21**] 10:04 AM
1. Scattered subcentimeter enhancing lesions predominantly at
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter junction are worrisome for
infection/toxoplasmosis versus metastatic disease and clinical
correlation is advised.
2. Marrow signal from the cervical spine is unusual with loss of
normal signal on T1, this is a nonspecific finding and may
represent skeletal metastases and a bone scan would be helpful
for further evaluation.
.
# TTE [**2115-5-21**] at 12:47:29 PM
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal
septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
small loculated pericardial effusion around the right atrium.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global biventricular systolic function. Small
pericardial effusion around right atrium (largest diameter 1.0
cm) . It appears trivial around the remainder of the heart.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-4-10**],
the pericardial effusion around the right atrium is better seen.
Otherwise, the findings are similar.
.
# PLEURAL FLUID [**2115-5-21**]: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC).
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-22**] 8:53 AM: Interval reaccumulation of
left pleural effusion.
.
# BONE SCAN  [**2115-5-22**]: No evidence of osseous metastases;
bladder uptake obscurs the central pelvis.
.
# CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2115-5-24**] 11:38 AM
Large left pleural effusion has increased since [**5-22**],
producing more rightward mediastinal shift, secondary
atelectasis in both the left lower lung and the central right
lung. No pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is obscured but there
has been a slight increase in caliber of mediastinal veins
suggesting elevated central venous pressure. Tip of the right
subclavian line ends low in the SVC. Multiple lung nodules are
largely obscured by atelectasis and effusion.
.
# CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2115-5-25**] 11:24 PM
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Further interval increase in size of left-sided pleural
effusion.
3. Large right hilar mass extending into the subcarinal region
and associated lymphadenopathy and innumerable pulmonary
metastases.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-5-26**] 7:33 AM: Increasing left
effusion with mediastinal shift.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-5-26**] 10:10 AM: Reduction in left
effusion. No pneumothorax.
#LE USD: [**2115-5-27**]: IMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT.
#TTE [**2115-5-28**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small to moderate pericardial effusion
anterior and posterior to the atria but very small anterior to
the RV. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-5-21**],
the amount of pericardial effusion has increased. The is no
clear echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.
#KUB [**2115-6-26**]: IMPRESSIONS: No intra-abdominal free air. No
evidence of obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
53F h/o HIV (no HAART, [**4-6**] CD4 490, VL > 100K), Stage IV NSCLC,
with L pleural effusion per CT.
.
# SOB: Thought secondary to progression of her underlying
disease and recurrent pleural effusions.  Patient had repeat
thoracentesis x2 on the floor as per HPI and later pleurodesis
after the effusions recurred.  Hypoxia post-pleurodesis thought
[**3-2**] to disease progression vs. adverse reaction to talc used on
pleurodesis.  Patient was increasingly tachypneic without relief
after bronchodilators or lasix.  Discussion was had with family
and patient who agreed with plan for no-intubation.  Briefly
tried on Bipap but was persistently tachypneic.  After much
discussion patient and family opted to be comfort measures only.
 Patient was made CMO and passed approximatley 12-24 hours
thereafter.
.
# Brain mets: New brain mets per MRI head with gad.
- [**5-22**]: Rad onc consult pending for question whole brain XRT
- [**5-23**]: Holding XRT pending chest treatment.  Toxo IgG, IgM
pending but unlikely toxo given last high CD4 count; however,
current CD4 359 (viral load pending)
- [**5-24**]: Held whole brain XRT pending chest XRT completion.
- Further treatments deferred.
.
# ?Osseous progression: Bone scan ordered, pending for [**5-22**].
- [**5-23**]: Pending official read.
- [**5-24**]: No evidence of osseous metastases; bladder uptake
obscurs the
central pelvis.
- Further work-up deferred.
.
# Stage IV NSCLC:  Held chemotherapy in acute illness.
- [**5-24**]: Alimta holding until after X
