HOSPITAL COURSE:  After admission he received Protonics,
Octreotide, Thiamine and Multivitamins as well as fluids.
The gastrointestinal service was consulted and they performed
an EGD which showed a hiatal hernia, esophageal candidiasis,
grade 3 esophagitis in the whole esophagus, a likely [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear, severe duodenitis and concluded that the source
of his GI bleed was the erosive esophagitis and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
tears.  As a result of the esophagitis, he was placed on
Diflucan and Nystatin swish and swallow.  His blood sugar was
increased presumably as a result of the Octreotide treatment
so he receives insulin on a sliding scale.  He also received
Ativan as needed per Ciwa scale.  When he was no longer
bleeding, he was considered stable enough to be transferred
to the medicine floor and this occurred on the [**2-19**].
He tolerated diet of clears and thus was advanced to a
regular diet and tolerated this as well.  On the final day of
his admission he developed a low grade fever to 100.4 which
then went down to 99.0 but to rule out infection we checked
the urinalysis which was normal and chest x-ray which showed
an infiltrate in the left posterior lobe of the lung which
may have represented pneumonia so we treated with
Levofloxacin 500 mg po q d for a 7 day course.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Sandostatin every 28 days as
