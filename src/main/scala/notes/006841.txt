Reports:
[**2107-8-27**]
EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Possible left atrial abnormality. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2107-8-6**] no interim diagnostic change.

[**2107-8-27**]
KUB:
IMPRESSION:
1. Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
2. No free air.

[**2107-8-27**]
Ct Abd/Pelvis w/PO contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. New areas of mucoid impaction/aspiration in the right lower
lobe with
resolution of several other previously noted areas.
2. Area of hypodensity within the left lobe of the liver is not
as well
evident. Limited evaluation of liver on this non-contrast
enhanced CT.
3. Status post partial gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy.
Significant
retention of oral contrast within a dilated esophagus and the
gastric remnant which may relate to holdup at the anastomotic
site/slow transit. No evidence of obstruction with oral contrast
demonstrated within distal loops of small bowel past the
jejunostomy site.
4. Colonic diverticulosis.
5. Apparent mild interval increase in size of the common bile
duct now measuring up to 11mm. Recommend clinical correlation
with LFTs and ultrasound can be considered.
6. New subcutaneous nodule in the mid uper abdomen may relate to
small postoperative seroma.
7. Multiple non-obstructing sub 4mm renal calculi.

[**2107-9-30**]
EKG
Moderate baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Slight
non-specific ST segment changes. Short P-R interval. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2107-9-26**], except for increase in rate,
no diagnostic interval change.

[**2107-9-30**]
CXR:
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for acute aspiration or evolving
aspiration pneumonia.

[**2107-10-1**]
CXR:
Impression: Bibasilar opacities are again visualized. The right
lower lobe has a plate-like appearance, and it may be secondary
to either volume loss or small infiltrate on the left. It has
more linear appearance and most likely represents volume loss.
Overall, no substantial change compared to the film from the
prior day.

[**2107-10-4**]
Barium Swallow/Small Bowel Follow Through:
IMPRESSION: No emptying of barium from stomach after 85 minutes
likely represents obstruction at the gastrojejunal anastamosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted to the West 3 surgery service on
[**2107-9-26**] for nausea and vomiting.  The patient was about 6 weeks
s/p subtotal gastrectomy with [**Last Name (un) **] gastrojejunostomy and J Tube.


Neuro: Patient reported severe pain that has been constant ever
since surgery at her J-tube site.  The patient received Dilaudid
IV and oxycodone through the J tube with some relief. Higher
doses of narcotic pain medication did not seem to help her pain
dramatically.  Regarding her nausea she was treated with IV
zofran and PR compazine which somewhat improved her symptoms,
though she continued to vomit persistently despite aggressive
antiemetic therapy.  Later in her admission she was placed on
Ativan for retching which subjectively helped to some degree.

CV: The patient had one episode of SBP in the 80's the day that
her sats dropped, presumptively due to aspiration.  The ICU team
gave her several small fluid boluses which promptly increased
her SBP nicely.  Otherwise the patient was stable from a
cardiovascular standpoint during this admission.

Pulmonary: On [**2107-9-30**] the patient had a saturation of 70 on her
late morning vitals as well as a temp of 101.  She was not
complaining of dyspnea or SOB.  She was placed on 6 L nasal
canula with resolution of her saturation to the low 90's.  Cxr
was consistent with aspiration or evolving aspiration PNA.  ABG
showed she was not acidotic or hypercarbic but  her PO2 was 54.
She was started on Vanc/Zosyn and transferred to the ICU.
During her ICU stay she initially had some SBP in the 80's which
responded nicely to fluid boluses.  The AB's were stopped in the
ICU as this was thought to be caused by an aspiration
pneumonitis rather than an aspiration pneumonia and she was
improving nicely.  She was called out on [**2107-10-1**] and was stable
from a pulmonary standpoint from there forward.

GI/GU:  Initially it was thought that perhaps her nausea was in
some way related to her J-tube.  CT scan showed possible holdup
at the anastomotic site/slow transit without any evidence of
obstruction.  On HD 1 the J-tube cuff was partially deflated,
with relatively little effect.  GI was consulted who took the
patient for EGD which showed some edema around the tube site but
no obvious cause for her N/V. She was started on tube feedings
via J-Tube on HD 1.  She tolerated the tube feeds well, though
she persistently vomited clear, foamy fluid (not tube feed-like
in appearance).  Because of her persistent vomiting GI was
reconsulted.  They recommended Barium swallow with small bowel
follow through.  This showed lack of gastric emptying as
outlined in the reports section.  The etiology of this lack of
emptying is likely due to edema of the gastrojejunal
anastamosis, and it is thought that this will resolve with time.

ID: The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection.  Other than the aforementioned aspiration pneumonitis
event the patient was afebrile without elevated white count.

Cancer: The patient was seen by the inpatient oncology service
during her admission for her previously diagnosed gastric
adenocarcinoma.  They recommended obtaining a CEA during this
adm
