.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pyelonephritis, perinephric or prostatic
abscess. Air-fluid level is identified within the bladder. Has
the patient recently been Foley catheterized?
2. Small left renal exophytic cyst. Right upper pole renal
lesion is too small to be fully characterized but appears
hyperdense and cannot be classified as a simple cyst. Ultrasound
may help characterize this lesion.
3. Persistent pulmonary tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity consistent with
small airway infection. Bilateral lower lobe consolidations may
be improved since two days prior and could represent atelectasis
versus pneumonia versus aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to MICU initially with pneumonia and
hypotension, question UTI.  On further evaluation believed to be
more likely urosepsis (although no cultures positive at OSH and
urine cultures remained negative here after receiving
antiobiotics).  Initially treated [**Last Name (un) 72755**] with ceftriaxone,
azithro, vanc.  Never required pressors.  Transferred to floor
and initially wbc count went down.  Switched to cefpodoxime and
azithro.  Then wbc count began to climb.  ID consulted.
Aspergillus seen in sputum twice.  Recommendation made to switch
antibiotic to cipro to cover urine more than lung.  CT
chest/abd/pelvis did not show any clear abscess.  Could get
ultrasound of kidney as outpatient to better define cyst seen.
PSA elevated and should be repeated as outpatient; biopsy once
infection resolves if still elevated.  Flagyl added empirically
for possible c diff but patient without diarrhea and stool
negative for c diff so flagyl stopped after 4 days (and wbc did
not improve).  Hematology reviwed peripheral smear and said
consistent with leukomoid reaction; no abnormal cells seen.
Pulmonary consult did not feel aspergillus was infectious but
more likely a colonizer and did not think bronch would be high
yield.  ID agreed with this.  LAP normal.  ESR elevated at 72.
Alk phos also mildly elevated 212.  CRP also elevated at 25.
Cortisol normal.  Even with wbc of 20 pt felt very well, no
symptoms.  Afebrile, ambulating in halls.  Decision made to
discharge patient to home with cipro to complete two week
course.  To get repeat wbc with results to be sent to PCP and
close follow up.  Still question prostatitis versus other
source.  To continue work up as outpatient.  Blood pressure
remained in normal range so meds not restarted.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Urosepsis
Elevated PSA
COPD


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with believed infection in your urine with
effects on your blood pressure (urosepsis).  You improved with
antibiotics.  However, your white blood cell count has remained
high.  We have not found another source of infection or other
reason for this elevation at this time.  However, as we have
discussed, since you are feeling so much better we will
discharge you today with plans to get repeat blood work with
your primary care doctor.  If you develop fevers, difficulty
urinating, or other focal problems please call your doctor
sooner or return to the hospital.
.
Your PSA (prostate specific antigen) level was increased as
well.  You should have this repeated by your doctor in a few
weeks.  If it remains elevated you should get a biopsy as an
outpatient to rule out cancer.
.
On CT scan a small lesion was seen on your kidney; it appeared
most like a cyst.  Your primary care doctor can consider getting
an ultrasound to further evaluate.

Followup Instructions:
A follow up appointment has been made with your primary care
doctor, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 72757**]) for [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**4-25**] at
445pm.
