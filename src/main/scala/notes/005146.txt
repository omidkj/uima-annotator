Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) intubation and ventilation
2) right wrist arthrocentesis
3) bronchoscopy
4) echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 56 year old man with a past medical history
significant for hepatitis C, on interferon, COPD, yearly
pneumonias, with one in [**2163**] that required medical induced coma
and ventilator for one month who developed fever and shortness
of breath over the past three days. Per the patient's wife, the
couple had babysat their sick one year old nephew this past
weekend. Subsequently, he developed three days of progressive
fever, nonproductive cough, and shortness of breath. Of note, he
recently completed a z-pack for a pneumonia three weeks ago,
that was prescribed by his outpatient physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the past
twenty four hours, the patient became more weak and had
increased shortness of breath. Concerned, he was brought to the
ED by his wife on the day of admission.
In the ED, patient was noted to have a temperature of 99.1 on
admission (spiked to 104.1), HR 133, BP 90/56, RR 20, and oxygen
saturation was 74% on room air. He had a white count of 7.2,
with 72% PMNs and 22 bands. Lactate was 6.3. First set of
troponins were negative. Chest xray revealed interstitial and
alveolar edema, so he received IV lasix. In addition, he was
started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. A trial on
BiPap was started for hypoxia to the 70's. The oxygen
saturations did not improve, so he was intubated. Blood pressure
was noted to decrease to the 70-80s, so he was given three
liters of IV fluids, started on levophed, and transferred to the
ICU on a sepsis protocol.

Had traumatic foley insertion on admission which resulted in
transfusion of 7 units of PRBCs during his ICU stay as well as
CBI for large bladder clot. By the time he was tx'ed to 11
[**Hospital Ward Name **], his urine was clear and the foley was removed, although
he continued to pass intermittant small clots (per GU this was
expected)

Shortly after admission, he grew out strep pneumomonia in his
blood cx's from admission and his sputum had MRSA. Was seen by
ID in ICU because of persistent fevers. Bronch on [**5-3**] with
dynamic lower trachea collapse. He finished 14 days of abx by
the time he was tx'ed out of the ICU. Pt was initially on
levofloxacin then CTX, then Zosyn/vanco MRSA (VAP). Zosyn was
stopped for rash followed by ARF.

[**4-26**] CXR
Lung volumes have improved since [**4-25**] along with a component
of pulmonary edema, but there is still extensive opacification
in the lower lungs and a suggestion of cavitation bilaterally
which would be due to pneumonia. Heart size is normal and there
is no appreciable mediastinal vascular engorgement. ET tube and
right jugular line are in standard placements. There is no
pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. If
the clinical picture is not clear, CT scanning would be helpful.
.
[**4-30**] CT HEAD
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage. There is no
midline shift, mass effect or hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. There is atherosclerotic
disease within the vertebral and internal carotid arteries. The
paranasal sinuses are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
