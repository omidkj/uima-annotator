History of Present Illness:
This is a 70 yo M with a past medical history significant for
CAD s/p MI x 2 and CABG, cirrhosis with a history of variceal
bleeds s/p banding in [**8-13**], who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an
OSH after several episodes of large hematemesis. The patient was
feeling generally unwell when he saw his PCP for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] regularly
scheduled appointment today. He was sent to get some bloodwork
drawn, which he did, and then returned home. He reports being in
his bathroom around 4pm the day of admission, had one episode of
melena and then suddenly he became extremely nauseated and had
three episodes of hematemesis, described as projectile by the
patient. He felt paralyzed but does not endorse dizziness,
lightheadedness, LOC, blurred vision or pain. Paramedics found
the patient confused, bradycardic with systolics in the 70's. He
was taken to the OSH, where he received some IV fluid
resuscitation. Labs were notable for H/H [**9-2**] (labs drawn by pcp
earlier in the day 12/35), INR 1.5, Ammonia 136. In the OSH ED,
he remained hemodynamically stable with SBP's 100-120. He
received zofran for nausea, IV protonix and 1 unit pRBC's before
transport.
.
He was transferred directly from OSH ED to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for
further work up and treatment. On arrival, the patient is
hemodynamically stable, mentating well and communicative. He
currently denies nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, headache, confusion. He
denies EtOH and has never had an EtOH abuse history.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted here at [**Hospital1 18**] for hematemesis
on [**2185-8-14**], at which time he was evaluated by both GI and
hepatology. He was initially seen at an OSH for 3 episodes
hematemesis and epistaxis begining on the morning of [**2185-8-14**]. He
was severely hypotensive, put on pressors, and given blood and
FFP before being medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here, he was intubated
for airway protection during EGD [**8-15**], which showed a variceal
bleed which was rebanded. He was extubated successfully [**8-17**]. He
received blood transfusions to Hct goal of 28 and received IV
PPI and octreotide drip. He was to be discharged on nadalol at
that time. Work up to explore the etiology of the patient's
cirrhosis was negative at that time for SLA, [**Doctor First Name **] and the viral
hepatitides, but smooth muscle antibodies were positive.
.
Also of note on his last admission was the incidental finding on
chest xray of extensive pleural disease likely related to
asbestos exposure, which was followed up by a chest CT which
additionally noted a loculated effusion at the left base with no
pleural masses only plaques as well as a 15mm paraesophageal
lymph node. This was to be worked up as an outpatient

the GE junction. No normal mucosa and some scarred areas with
new varices on top. In the stomach there were large varices in
the cardia.  Mucosa of body and stomach with portal hypertensive
gastropathy worst from last endoscopy.  No banding done at this
time.

-Kidney stones s/p penile urethra surgery to remove the stone
-Migraine headaches
-Asbestosis

CXR on admission [**2185-12-7**]: extensive pleural disease along the
lower right heart border and evidence of a LLL infiltrate vs.
effusion, perhaps slightly larger than prior study in [**8-13**].
.
EGD [**2185-8-14**]: 5 cords of grade III varices were seen in the lower
third of the esophagus. The varices were bleeding. There were
signs of previous banding, however there were grade 3 varices
distal to previous banding scars with 2 varices actively
bleeding.  5 bands were successfully placed. Portal Hypertensive
Gastropathy.
.

ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly

regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: 70 yo M with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis,
esophageal variceal bleeding MICU callout, deteriorated
significantly with resp failure, hypotention, abd.compartment
syndrome, made CMO.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt developed in the setting of recieving
blood, there was a question of TRALI, ARDS [**1-7**] infection,
hepatopulmonary syndrome and fluid overload - negative w/u for
TRALI here, aggressively diuresed, contaminated sputum and
bubble study significant for intracardiac shunt. Pt intubated as
hypoxic, however after discussion with family, made CMO and
extubated with goals of care mainly comfort. Also IV antibiotics
stopped. Pt was transferred to the medicine wards.
.
# Abdominal compartment syndrome: Chronic based on pt history,
bladder pressure remain
