History of Present Illness:
56 year old female with DM, CRI, diastolic HF, 2+AR, 2+MR, from
nursing home, who presents with 1 day tachypnea, hypoxemia with
O2Sat initially 88%, then progressed despite lasix/zaroxyln and
nebulizer treatment.  In ED, RR 30, 92% 3liters with nebulizer,
lasix, and prednosine. Later patient noted to have acute HTN
with SBP 200s with acute increased O2 requirement ond
respiratory distress. Patient given nitro drip, and IV lasix
(160mg-->>2.4liters out), hydralazine and morphine for presumed
acute CHF. Patient ABG was 7.30/33/471 on 100% NRB. Patient put
on 3 hour trial CPAP then weaned to weaned to NRB.  Patient
currently on nasal cannula.  Course further complicated by AMS,
somnolent + transient hypoglycemia. Patient given D50, Narcan,
and negative Head CT. She was transfused 1 unit PRBC and given
HCO3 drip for nonGAP acidosis.  Patient transferred to MICU for
management of hypoxia, tachypnea, acute renal failure, altered
mental status, with initial presentation most consistent with
decompensated CHF.  In the unit patient was weaned from NRB mask
to nasal cannula.  Chest xray suggests more a pneumonitis than
CHF.

CXR ([**2167-11-17**]): IMPRESSION:  1) More intense patchy bilateral
interstitial infiltrate with a changing appearance, more
suggestive of patchy pneumonitis than CHF.
2) New left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation with an
adjacent small- left sided pleural effusion.

CT Chest ([**2167-11-18**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Smooth interstitial thickening with upper lobe predominance
and pleural effusions. Findings are consistent with CHF/fluid
overload. In an immunocompromised patient, diffuse infectious
processes such as PCP may also be considered.
2. Hypodense appearance of the blood consistent with anemia.
3. Air within the biliary system probably relates to prior
biliary procedure. Correlate clinically.

Echo ([**2167-11-18**]): Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular
systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of
valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the proximal descending
thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-16**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be
quantified. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate aortic regurgitation. Mild-moderate
mitral
regurgitation. Preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function.
Compared with the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of
[**4-19**], the
findings are similar.




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient 56 year old female with DM2, CRI, COPD, diastolic
HF, and 2+AR/2+MR admitted to MICU from nursing home, who
presents with 1 day history of tachypnea, hypoxemia with O2Sat
88%, and concern for respiratory failure.

--Respiratory distress
Most likely multifactorial, but believed to be predominantly CHF
in the setting of diastolic heart failure and flash edema due to
acute HTN (SBP in 200s). In the MICU treated for CHF
exacerbation and given IV lasix with good effect. Afterload
reduction/BP control with Hydralazine, Isosorbide Dinitrate, and
Labetolol. Further review of CXR suggested atypical pnuemonia.
The patient was initially started on started on Levofloxacin and
Zosyn, b
