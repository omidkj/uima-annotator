mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, vein graft to
ramus), Maze Procedure, with Ligation of Left Atrial Appendage


History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 year old male who developed atrial fibrillation
back in [**2180-1-20**]. He was quite symptomatic, complaining of
shortness of breath, paroxsymal nocturnal dyspnea and excessive
fatigue. Since that time, he has undergone several unsuccessful
cardioversions. He was known to have a left atrial thrombus by
echocardiogram and therefore [**Last Name (un) **] not a candidate to undergo
percutaneous pulmonary vein isolation procedure. He was
therefore referred to cardiac surgical Maze procedure. Prior to
the operation, he underwent cardiac catheterization which showed
moderate coronary artery disease.

Coronary Artery Disease - prior PTCA in [**2158**]
Atrial Fibrillation with Left Atrial Appendage Thrombus
Congestive Heart Failure
Hypertension
Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy

[**2181-1-8**] Admit Chest X-ray: Heart size top normal. Pulmonary
vasculature minimally engorged in the upper lungs. No focal
pulmonary abnormality is visible. Small pleural effusion is seen
posteriorly on the lateral view, probably on the right.

[**2181-1-19**] Transthoracic ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size.
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade
III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Physiologic
mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old man s/p CABGx2
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**1-26**].
HISTORY: CABG, evaluate pleural effusions.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-22**] through
[**1-25**]:
Moderate bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than right,
unchanged since [**1-25**], improved since [**1-22**]. The lung
volumes are low. Atelectasis in the left lower lobe is mild to
moderate and unchanged. Heart size and cardiomediastinal
silhouette normal. Tip of the left subclavian line projects over
the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 77157**] was admitted for heparinization. His
preoperative course was uneventful. On [**1-11**], he was
taken to the operating room and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting along with Maze procedure and ligation of left atrial
appendage. For surgical details, please see seperate dictated
operative note.
In summary he had a CABGx2 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-Ramus, Maze, and
Ligation of left atrial appendage. His bypass time was 145
minutes with a crossclamp of 98 minutes.
Following the operation, he was brought to the Cardiac surgery
ICU. In the immediate post-operative period and then for several
days the patient required several pressors to maintain adequate
tone, and during this time he remained sedated and intubated. By
POD4 we were able to wean most of his pressors and by POD6 all
vasoactive agents were weaned off. At this point his sedation
was stopped and he was extubated. The patient required prolonged
diuresis with a lasix infusion. On POD12 he was transferred to
the step down floor, additionally he had a left thoracentesis
without complication. Over the next several days his activity
was advanced with the assistance of nursing and PT. He was
anticoagulated for his Maze procedure and on POD17 it was
decided he was stable and ready for discharge to rehabilitation
at [**Hospital 57733**] Rehab in [**Location (un) 2203**].
