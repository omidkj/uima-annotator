History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40503**] is a 53 year old M with PMH of chronic vent/trach
recent admission for VAP, severe COPD, prior L CVA with residual
R-sided weakness, seizure disorder, depression and schizophrenia
who presents from rehab after being found unresponsive
overnight.  According to notes the patient was checked on at 430
and found unresponsive in his bed.  He did not respond to
sternal rub.  He was taken off of the ventilator and bagged with
improvement in mental status.  He was then found unresponsive
again at 7am and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Mr. [**Known lastname 40503**] was discharged from MICU [**Location (un) **] on [**7-3**].  He was
admitted hypotensive and hypoxic and found to have ventilator
associated PNA.  Sputum and BAL cultures grew Pseudomonas and
Stenotrophomonas.  He was treated with cefepime, tobramycin, and
high dose Bactrim all of which he was still taking at time of
presentation.  He was also noted to have frequent mucus plugging
requiring suctioning.  He was also hypotensive with SBPs in the
70s related to sepsis vs. adrenal insufficiency.  Of note he was
also followed by psychiatry during his hospitalization for
concern of suicidal ideation.  He was noted to have right sided
pleural effusion with collapse improved after IR guided
thoracentesis.

In the ED the patient's vital signs were T 98.8, BP 86/53 , HR
98, RR 16 , O2 sat 97-100% on AC 500/12/.[**5-15**].  On arrival he was
alert and oriented x 2, interactive.  Respiratory was called and
he was placed on the ventilator.  He was noted to be hypotensive
to the systolic 70s-80s.  He initially refused a line and IVF
was given through PICC.  Labs notable for elevated WBC count to
19.5 with 91% neutrophils.  Lactate 1.9, first set of cardiac
enzymes negative.  UA negative.  CXR showed alight proximal
migration of right-sided PICC line with tip now terminating
within the mid subclavian vein, persistent right middle and
lower lobe collapse, increased patchy airspace opacities at the
left lung base which could represent pneumonia or aspiration.
Given persistent hypotension, patient acquiesced to central
access and a femoral line was placed.  He received 2L IVF with
improvement in systolic BPs to 100s.  He was also given a dose
of Vancomycin and Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 in the ED.  He then
became diaphopretic with a fixed gaze, minimally responsive BP
188/84 R18, 99 % per report he desatted to the 80s but this was
not reported.  He was 2 mg ativan IV x1 given history of
seizures.  he then became AAOx3 and did not recall the event. No
urinary or fecal incontinence or tonic clonic activity noted.
He is being admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and
hypotension.

Of note, patient has been on a ventilator since [**Month (only) 359**] for
respiratory failure secondary to severe COPD. He was found to
have a RML and RLL collapse and paratracaheal LAD as well as
chronic right pleural effusions at that time.

Past Medical History:

the beginning of [**2140-10-10**], ?reportedly due to COPD
exacerbation

hilar LAD.
