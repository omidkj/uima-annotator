[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with delirium, doing infectious work-up.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o infiltrate.
AP CHEST, [**2156-8-7**], 08:27 HOURS

HISTORY: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with delirium. Rule out sepsis.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2156-5-29**]:

Heart is mildly enlarged and the pulmonary vasculature engorged.
There is no pneumonia or pleural effusion. Thoracic aorta is
generally tortuous and calcified, but not focally dilated.

HISTORY: Acute GI bleed.

REPORT: Following intravenous injection of autologous red blood
cells labelled
Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and delayed images of the abdomen for 60
minutes were
obtained.

Blood flow images show normal, expected uptake of tracer. No
areas of
extravasation are seen.

Delayed blood pool images again show no evidence of
extravasation of tracer to
indicate a location of gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

IMPRESSION: No extravasation of tracer identified to indicate
location of
gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
/nkg

Reason: eval for bleed

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with HTN, admitted with gi bleed, now suddenly
confused with blown right pupil
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Hypertension, now confused with dilated right pupil.

TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT. This study is limited by motion.

FINDINGS: Comparison with [**2156-5-29**]. No hydrocephalus, shift
of normally midline structures, intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, or acute major vascular territorial infarct is
identified. There is prominence of the sulci and ventricles;
however, this is not significantly changed since the last
examination. Minor mucosal maxillary thickening is again noted
in the right maxillary sinus. No fractures are identified.

IMPRESSION: Study limited by motion, however, no acute
intracranial pathology identified. No significant interval
change since [**2156-5-29**].


Brief Hospital Course:
A/p: [**Age over 90 **] yo M

1. GI Bleed: patient with mult episodes of BRBPR.  Likely from
lower source given that Hct slowly going down.  Has remained
hemodynamically stable in ED.   No reoccurrence of GI bleed in
past 3 days. Location of bleed is yet to be determined. Bleeding
test was negative.  Continue to monitor for any changes.
Colonoscopy is necessary to determine location, as per GI. HCT
has been running in 27-29 for the past  days. It has been stable
but it low. Lab results today show that crit has decreased to
27.6. A unit of blood is necessary as the crit has dropped.
Discussed patient with GI. GI is following patient. Feel that he
is stable at the moment. [**Name2 (NI) **] plan from them. ON [**8-9**], crit had
increased to over 30. Still awaiting decision if f/u colonoscopy
is warranted given pt HX with the prep. Pt was given senna and
had 200 cc melena over night on [**8-12**]. Pt had not had bowel
movement since GI prep; this could just be residual blood from
initial GIB/. Repeat colonoscopy was decided against due to pts
present state

.
2. Delirium: Pt has remained in a confused state  for the past 4
days. He has been placed in restraints due to threatening
behavior and trying to pull at tubes. MS change has been
improving. He remains confused. He is responsive to voice and
tactile stimulation. Pt is mumbling but beginning to make more
sense. Concern remains what MS change is due to. Infectious work
up is in process. Began pt on olanzapine as per geriatric
consult. Pt had a run of SVT over the night on [**8-7**] but was
easily arousable. NO concern felt. ON [**8-8**], pt was conversing.
He appeared to be returning to his original state. Foley was d/c
and ucx and BCX taken. ucx was negative. UA obtained showed some
bacteria and WBC. That evening, Foley replaced due to lack of
output. Pt became combative and was given olanzapine. On rounds
on [**8-9**], pt unarousable. Tried to arouse him with multiple
stimuli with little response.  Suction was used to remove sputum
and fluid accumulating in his throat and mouth. Pt was
responsive to this measure. His eyes would bunch up and he tried
to block the suction.   His blood pressure decreased to 90/60.
But then returned between 118-120 and then increased to 130/85.
CXR showed Left retrocardiac opacity. Pt afternoon, pt
responsive and more alert. D/c haldol and olanzapine. If
combative, pt will be placed in restraints. Trying to have
patient come off the past medications. On [**8-9**], began Levaquin
due to CXR showing possible aspiration pneumonia and a possible
UTI as shown by UA. These are both possible causes for patients
current state. Marked improvement noted on [**8-10**]. Pt became more
responsive and was able to tell the story of how he ended up in
the hospital. SPS consulted again for evaluation. Vanco was d/c
as blood CX on [**8-3**] showed that bacteria was susceptible to
oxacillin.
-Bacteremia seems to be the cause of the delirium

Pt given trazodone and lodaxaprine on the night of [**8-10**]. The
following morning, pt arousable but became agitated. Mitt
restraints initiated to stop patient from pulling foley. Pt
continues to wax and wane in his knowledge of place and time.
The AM of [**8-12**], pt was conversive and alert to his location. He
then proceeded to begin pulling on his IV and trying to removed
bandages. Pt continues to have bouts of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]. He
alert to people but confused over who people are and various
events that are occurring.
.
3. HTN: Hydralazine
- if pt becomes re-oriented, possibly return to Univasc 15mg PO
daily. On [**8-13**],  began Univasc as replacement for hydralazine.

4.PPX: pneumonic boots have been placed on patient since initial
changes. Request for patient to be repositioned q2h to avoid
pressure ulcers.

5. FEN: Pt begun on D5W upon admission. When MS change,
continued on D5W. On [**8-9**], begun on D5 [**12-28**] N. SPS consulted and
found pt should remain NPO. Decision made to check the next day
for alertness. If pt remains alert and partially oriented, SPS
will be re consulted. if not, NG tube and nutrition consult will
be obtained. SPS reevaluated patient on [**8-11**] and determined t
