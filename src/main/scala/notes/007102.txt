ADDENDUM:

Subsequent to the time of the last dictation, the patient
experienced increasing mental status changes and delirium.
This was attributed to her chronic hypoxia at first, however,
out any other causes for her mental status changes.  This
magnetic resonance scan showed confluent cortical T2
hyperintensity and slight enhancement involving the medial
temporal lobes in both insula. The pattern is suggestive of
herpes simplex encephalitis versus perineoplastic limbic
encephalitis.  To determine which of these causes is
responsible for the patient's mental status changes, a lumbar
cell count mainly lymphocytic in origin.  Therefore, the
patient was begun on Acyclovir intravenous for presumptive
HSV encephalitis. A HSV PCR was sent which later returned
positive!!

The patient was also managed supportively at this
time.  A few days later, the laboratory called with the
results of the CMV antigen and her BAL returned positive.
For this, the question was whether the patient should be
started on intravenous Ganciclovir to treat for CMV. A CMV
serum antigen was also sent to exclude any possibility of
contamination.  This also returned positive with a CMV serum
antigen level in the 3000s.  Therefore, the patient was
switched from Acyclovir to Ganciclovir intravenously.

The patient was continued on her AmBisome and her Flagyl which
had been discontinued secondary to the presumed treatment of
her Clostridium difficile infection was restarted.

The patient experienced increasing episodes of confusion during
this time, increasing shortness of breath with an increased
oxygen requirement, an episode of desaturation down to the
70s and temperature decreasing to 95 to 96 range.  Therefore,
for presumed sepsis, the patient was begun on Vancomycin
empirically.  Her Ganciclovir was
continued as was the Dapsone.  The patient was also started
initially on Ceftriaxone but secondary to Penicillin allergy
was switched to Ciprofloxacin intravenously to cover for
pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The patient had a repeat chest x-ray
performed which suggested possible pneumonia in addition to
her other disease.  She had a repeat urinalysis sent which
returned positive for Staphylococcus aureus.  Subsequently,
her blood cultures returned positive for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was treated
aggressively with antibiotics during this time.

She required the use of a nonrebreather mask.  She had to have a
one to one sitter for her increasing delirium and given her
overall
prognosis and her increasing distress, on these treatments,
the family as health care proxy, [**Name (NI) 717**] [**Name (NI) **] and her
husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4709**] were approached to discuss plans for her
care.  At that time, the family felt that the patient had
undergone enough intervention and was suffering with the
treatment that she was undergoing.  Therefore, the decision
was made to make the patient comfortable rather than to
pursue any further aggressive intervention.  The patient was
begun on Morphine empirically to control her pain and
dyspnea.  She also received Ativan for increasing agitation.
Her oxygen was continued but her antibiotics were
discontinued.  The patient who was a very pleasant female
passed away on the night of [**2150-3-27**].
