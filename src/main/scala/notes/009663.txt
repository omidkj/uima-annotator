Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain & tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer as
well as atrial fibrillation, PVD presents with progressive
abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting which began 1 month ago. He
reported an increase in his abdominal pain today, the location
of the pain is across the lower quadrants. He has been taking
oxycodone with minimal relief, pain is present constantly and
increases intermittently. He has been passing flatus and had a
bowel movement this morning. Stools last week guaiac negative
and remained so in the ER. He has also had nausea and emesis
times 3 this morning. Pt had PET yesterday that showed disease
progression in lymph nodes located in the abdomen and he will
need chemotherapy for this.

.
In the ED he had a benign abdominal exam, was seen by surgery
who ordered CT abd/pelvis which confirmed LAD, cannot r/o
infection in necrotic tissue as compared to PET scan done
yesterday, radiology was less concerned for infection, of note
this did show a RLL pneumonia. Afebrile, Tachycardic 120-140s, 2
liters fluid, morphine. INR 4.7, guiac + brown stool, NG lavage
clear. CTX, levaquin, flagyl, lactate normal, no SBO, surgery
has seen him. Rads said inguinal nodes would be easily bx.
Vitals upon transfer:
132, 145/90, 20, 100% room air, NG tube in place. Patient
admitted to ICU for tachycardia.


Past Medical History:
NSCLC metastatic to subclavian lymph nodes in [**Month (only) **] 2008chemo/XRT

Atrial fibrillation
PVD

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Had a right hilar mass on preoperative chest
x-ray performed in anticipation of peripheral bypass surgery. He
was then referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in pulmonology and underwent
PET/CT on [**2194-1-7**] which showed a 5.5 cm x 3.7 cm right
infrahilar mass with spiculated borders as well as adenopathy in
the mediastinal and
subclavicular right lymph nodes. Brain MRI on [**2194-1-16**] was
negative for metastases. He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2194-1-10**],

and the bronchioalveolar lavage cytology was positive for
nonsmall cell lung cancer. FNA of the right lower lobe and FNA
of the R4 lymph nodes were negative. He then underwent FNA of
the right subclavicular node by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2194-1-28**] with
pathology positive for malignant cells consistent with
metastatic
nonsmall cell carcinoma favoring adenocarcinoma.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT abd/pelvis showed worsenin right basilat process c/w post obs
pneumonia. 5.3 cm right adrenal lesion unchanged, myolipoma. No
hydro. 6cm fatty mass along sup aspect left kidney unchnaged,
angiomyolipoma. No bowel obs or free air. Multiple RP and right
iliac chain lymph nodes with necrotic centers, largest in left
RP. Small stent in right common iliac. No free pelvic fluid.
.
Recent TTE [**4-3**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). A
prominent Eustacian valve is seen. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 73471**]
Reason: eval for interval change/worsening obstruction



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   68 year old man with NSCLC, metastatic, persistent
distention, ? ileus. Now
   with vomiting
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for interval change/worsening obstruction



Final Report
HISTORY: Abdominal distention.

Single supine radiograph of the abdomen again demonstrates
distended loops of
small bowel and colon. The finding is similar to that seen on
[**2194-6-25**].
Surgical sutures are again noted in the right lower quadrant. No

pneumoperitoneum is evident. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. A
vascular stent again projects over the low pelvis.

IMPRESSION:

Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Distention of the small and large
bowel
suggests ileus. Close clinical followup is requested.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 73472**]
Reason: Evaluate new leukocytosis and increasing abd pain.



[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   68 year old man with metastatic NSCLC, afib, PVD p/w
progressive abd pain, N/V.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   Evaluate new leukocytosis and increasing abd pain.
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.



Final Report
INDICATION: 68-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung
cancer,
atrial fibrillation and PVD, now with progressive abdominal
pain, nausea and
vomiting. Please evaluate for source of new leukocytosis and
abdominal pain.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior imaging studies, most recently CT
from [**2194-6-19**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis
was
performed following administration of oral and intravenous
contrast.
Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.

CT ABDOMEN: Nasogastric tube has been removed. Right hilar
spiculated mass
is again partially imaged, and right basilar consolidation has
worsened. There
is a new small right pleural effusion.

Liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable. Right
adrenal
myelolipoma, and left adrenal gland are unchanged. Kidneys are
unchanged,
with 6 cm fatty mass along the superior aspect of the left
kidney, which
remains most consistent with an exophytic angiomyolipoma or
perirenal lipoma.

Stomach is unchanged. Intra-abdominal loops of bowel are normal.
There is no
bowel obstruction. There is no free intraperitoneal air. There
is a trace
amount of ascites, increased from previous exam.

Multiple enlarged gastrohepatic, periaortic, retroperito
