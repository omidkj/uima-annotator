Service:  [**Company 191**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
woman who has a past medical history dominated by severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with OSA, as well as
CAD, and CHF.  The patient was brought to the emergency
department this AM by her son, after she awakened with severe
shortness of breath.  She was discharged from [**Hospital1 1501**] ([**Hospital1 2670**]
in [**Location (un) 5089**]).  Two weeks ago, doing well overall, with
increased activity level and no chest pain or resting
dyspnea.  She denied recent fever of chills.  She has a cough
at baseline.

She was last hospitalized in late [**Month (only) 216**] with fatigue and
later chest pain; she underwent catheterization and stenting
of 90% lesions of RCA and left circumflex.  She went to the
[**Hospital1 1501**] for rehabilitation as above.  She was doing well and
continued to do well at home.  She denies nausea, vomiting,
or chest pain with present illness.  She was found to be
febrile in the emergency department with striking
leukocytosis and new right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest
x-ray.

Chest x-ray also was consistent with mild CHF.  The tachypnea
and desaturation had responded to repeated medications and
increased oxygen.  In the emergency department, she was
initially treated with nebulizers with some mild improvement,
however, she acutely worsened with increasing shortness of
breath, increased systolic blood pressure to the 200s and
heart rate to the 130s sinus tachycardia.

EKG showed ST segment depression in the lateral leads.  She
was given aspirin, IV Lopressor, nitropaste, morphine, and 40
IV Lasix with good response.  The ST segment depression
resolved.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with 100 plus pack
year smoking history, resulting in multiple hospitalizations.
2.  OSA.  The patient has documented sleep apnea.  The
patient is on home oxygen and CPAP.  The patient reports not
using the CPAP due to relative intolerance.
3.  She has both restrictive and obstruction defects on PFTs
and she has been dependent on oral steroids.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.  She has a history of diabetes
mellitus requiring treatment in the early [**2088**].  She is
maintained on insulin b.i.d. with a sliding scale.
5.  Glucose control has been fair at best over time.
6.  Coronary artery disease.  Noteworthy for myocardial
infarction and PTCA in [**2089**].  She had echocardiogram in the
mid [**2088**] showing good function, but with worsening
exertional chest pain in [**2094**].  She underwent endotracheal
MIBI with an anterior defect as identified on catheterization
to have 100% LAD lesions for which PTCA was performed.  She
ultimately redeveloped a restenosis of the stent placement
complicated by Dfib.  ETT MIBI on [**10/2098**] showed a good EF
and equivocal EKG changes with anginal symptoms.  She
underwent catheterization and angioplasty of two vessels, RCA
and proximal LAD in [**2099-8-23**].  She developed unstable
coronary syndrome in [**2100-9-23**].  She underwent repeat
catheterization and another PTCA of the right (PDA).  Latest
dobutamine MIBI showed inferior ischemia.  Most recent
cardiac intervention as described above.
7.  Osteoporosis with recurrent back pain and dorsal
compression fractures.  She has had bilateral hip fractures
and THRs, hospitalized twice for rehabilitation at [**Hospital3 5090**] in [**2098**] and earlier this year times two, last at
[**Hospital1 2670**].
8.  Chronic pain.  She is on Percocet for chronic pain.
9.  Anxiety disorder.
10. Depression.
11. Longstanding chronic abdominal pain.
12. Chronic constipation.
13. Hypercholesterolemia, status post bilateral cataract
surgery with limited vision in one eye.

SULFA DRUGS AND A QUESTIONABLE ALLERGY TO CEPHALOSPORIN.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease and
stroke.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone with VNA support and
close attention by her son.  She had been resistant to
nursing home placement despite frequent hospitalizations
after decompensation at home.  She has 100% pack per year
history of cigarettes.  No recent tobacco or ethanol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
The patient is an obese Cushingoid woman lying semiupright in
bed at rest.  VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 108, blood pressure 174/74,
temperature 101.6, oxygen saturation 91% on three liters.
SKIN:  Scattered abdominal striae and few resolving
ecchymoses.  HEENT:  No overt sinus tenderness.  EOMI:
conjugates and grossly full.  Conjunctivae are clear.  Mild
nasal congestion.  Oropharynx:  There is normal, but,
however, dry mucosa.  NECK:  Supple, slightly reduced range
of motion.  CHEST:  Dorsal kyphosis with very faint breath
sounds throughout; coarse scattered wheezes and rhonchi
especially anteriorly; reduced breath sounds in the right
round ligament with no obvious consolidation, but harsh
crackles extreme base, no egophony.  HEART:  Regular, normal
S1 and S2.  No obvious gallops.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur
at the upper lobe and upper right sternal border.  PMI
slightly laterally displaced.  Hyperdynamic.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
obese, diffuse minimal tenderness less than baseline, loud
bowel sounds, no overt masses are appreciated.  EXTREMITIES:
Striking distal wasting, no edema.  No acute joint
inflammation.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient is dozing, but

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data showed a white count of
216.5, hematocrit 30.9, platelet count 497,000.  Sodium 142,
potassium 4.1, chloride 99, bicarbonate 25, BUN 15,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 100.  ABG on three liters was 7.5,
38, 60.  CK was 94.  Troponin I less than 0.3.  Urinalysis
negative for nitrite, negative for leukocyte esterase, 3 to 5
white blood cells, no red blood cells, many bacteria, 6 to 10
squamous cells.  Chest x-ray disclosed new right basilar
consolidation, no overt CHF, small pleural effusion.

EKG showed sinus tachycardia at a 120 beats per minute, left
axis deviation, which was old.  A second EKG disclosed sinus
tachycardia at 125 beats per minute, new 1 mm ST segment
depressions in V4 through V6.  A third EKG showed that the ST
depressions now resolved and the heart rate had decreased to
110.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was noted to have acute onset
of dyspnea with fever and evidence on examination and chest
x-ray of likely new right lower lobe pneumonia against the
backdrop of severe COPD/OSA and CHF.  The patient showed
initial improvement in the emergency department, but worsened
this afternoon, suggestive of pulmonary edema superimposed on
pneumonia.  She was also noted to have lateral EKG changes.

The patient was admitted to the MICU for stabilization and
further evaluation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  by systems.

PULMONARY:  The patient was noted to have an acute
