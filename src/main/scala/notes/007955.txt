CXR ([**2-4**])
Low inspiratory volumes. Left retrocardiac opacity, which may
represent atelectasis, aspiration, or developing pneumonia.
.
CXR ([**2-5**])
Lung volumes are low, but improved since [**2-4**], with only
mild atelectasis at the base of the right lung. There is no
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Heart size is
normal. Upper lungs show vascular engorgement, but are otherwise
clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt tolerated procedure well and 22 of her 25 stones were
removed.  Left in place: a 6 x 26 double J ureteral stent with
the curl confirmed to be in the bladder and in the renal pelvis
fluoroscopically and a #24 French Foley as a left nephrostomy
tube.  Stones were sent for pathological exam.  Pt was started
on clidamycin, which was continued until d/c.
.
In the PACU the pt experienced respiratory distress and
desaturated to 58%, became cyanotic and unresponsive.
Anesthesia was called and pt was ventilated.  Narcan was
administered, ABG and EKG sent.  O2 sat returned quickly to 95%
and spontaneous breathing and responsiveness returned.  HR and
BP remained stable and appropriate throughout.  At post-op
check, pt was comfortable, A&O and saturating in the high 90's
on nasal canula.  It was thought the patient may have been
volume overloaded and diuresis with lasix was started.  Pt
received lasix 20 IV x2.  She was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
monitoring overnight.
.
POD1 pt did well was weaned off supp. O2 and was comfortable.
Nephrostomy tube was clamped and Foley was removed.  The pt was
transferred to the floor.
.
POD2 pt comfortable on room air with good sats.  Nephrostomy
tube was removed.  Pt had leakage from site overnight
.
POD3 one 3-0 ethilon suture was placed to close the drain site.
Pt was comfortable, tolerating PO and ambulating.  She was
afebrile and saturating well.  Pt was d/c'd home in good
condition.  She will follow up for stent removal, suture removal
and plan for removing remaining stones.
