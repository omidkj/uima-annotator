History of Present Illness:
44m with HIV (most recent CD4 9) and emphysema p/w acute on
chronic dyspnea (on 4 L NC at home), BLE edema present with
increasing SOB. History is obtained this his mother and a phone
conversation with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the past week the patient has
had increasing SOB and cough. Per his mother he was functioning
despite the syptoms until the day prior to admission when he
became extreely SOB and felt "like he was having an asthma
attck." His mother said that he felt he had to call the
ambulance because his breathing had become too labored. He has
been increasingly using his inhalers over the past week with
little improvment in his symptoms. He saw his PCP 5 days PTA at
which time he was started on levofloxacin and bactrim for
possible PNA and fluconazole for thrush. Per his mother, he has
been taking all of his medications.
.
His PCP encouraged him to present to the days ago given his
worsening anasarca and SOB, but patient was resistant at first.
Per the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been working with him at home to attempt to
get him to be more compliant with medications and he was
improving somewhat until this past week when he became more SOB
and edmatous.

Pertinent Results:

ST-T wave changes
.
Imaging:
.
CXR: Bilateral patchy opacities (prelim)
.
CTA chest: In  comparison  to  the  prior  study,  there  is
interval  progression  of parenchymal  abnormalities  consistent
 with  an  opportunistic  infection  in  this patient  with
known  HIV.    There  are  ill-defined  patchy  and  tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities  predominantly  in  the  left  lower  lobe,  lingula
and  right  middle  lobe with  additional  diffuse  ground-glass
 opacities  involving  the  entire  lungs.  There  is  no
mediastinal,  hilar,  or  axillary  lymphadenopathy.   Airways
are patent.    Heart  and  great  vessels  remain  normal.  No
clinically  significant  PE
is  seen.    There  are  several  equivocal  filling  defects
in  the  second-order branches  of  the  lower  lobes  (3:66
and  3:59).    Images  through  the  upper  abdomen do  not
reveal  acute  findings
IMPRESSION:
1.    Findings  consistent  with  interval  progression  of
primary  infection,  likely
with  opportunistic  agents  in  this  patient  with  HIV.
2.    No  evidence  of  clinically  significant  PE.
Equivocal  partial  filling defects  in  several  second-order
branches  of  the  left  lower  lobes  bilaterally.
.
LE u/s: No DVT
.
TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
0-5mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function  are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue  Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal.  The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet  excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are  structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo male with HIV/AIDS, COPD, anasarca p/w SOB, intubated and
admitted to ICU, likely secondary to COPD exacerbation.
Hospital course by problem:
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Believed to be most likely COPD
exacerbation possibly secondary to underlying infection.
Respiratory mechanics showed increased airway resistence.  He
was therefore treated with solumedrol as well as albuterol and
atrovent. Monteleukast was also added for persistent elevated
airway resistence.  There was never any culture data guiding
treatment of possible infection despite potential of a LLL
infiltrate on CXR which never cleared over the course of
admission. Patient completed a course of azithromycin as well as
ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia. He also completed
a course of Bactrim for potential PCP despite negative BAL as he
had received treatment prior to admission.  Patient self
extubated numerous times, each time requiring reintubation for
increased work of breathing and respiratory distress.  For this,
he required increasing levels of sedation.  He was started on
around the clock haldol in an attempt to decrease his sedation
requirements without success.  He was eventually weaned off of
the ventilator but failed extubation after 36 hours believed
most likely secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. NIFs
throughout admission were in the low 20s. Patient went for trach
and PEG and received both without incident.  He did extremely
well following the procedure and sedation was once again weaned.

.
# HIV/AIDS: Most recent CD4 9. Has h/o [**Month/Day/Year 1074**] gastritis, [**Female First Name (un) **],
and toxoplasmosis infections. He was continued on his home HAART
regimen without incident.
.
# hyponatremia: Patient developed hyponatremia believed to be
most likely secondary to increased free water with tube feeds
and antibiotics.  There was no evidence of SIADH on urine
examination.  Free water with tube feeds were stopped and
antibiotics were placed in normal saline with resolution of
hyponatremia.
.
# Anasarca: Likely in setting of malnutrition (last albumin 2.4)
and HIV. ECHO showed normal EF. Was aggressively diuresed and
was >5L negative at the end of his admission with resolution of
anasarca.  He received tube feeds throughout admission and
repeat albumin was 2.6.
.
# Diarrhea:  Chronic, but patient w/ large volume output.  C
diff negative x 3. [**Female First Name (un) 1074**] has been negative this admission.
Potentially secondary to HAART therapy.  He was started on
imodium.
