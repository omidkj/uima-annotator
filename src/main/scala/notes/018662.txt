HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year old woman,
with a remote history of tuberculosis, status post wedge
resection in [**2087**], and history of bronchoalveolar lung
cancer, status post right upper lobe lung lobectomy and XRT
in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year.

She presented to an internist in [**State 108**] three to four weeks
prior to admission, with a complaint of non productive cough.
No fevers or shortness of breath above baseline.  Cough was
also associated with chest pain on the right side that was
sharp and pleuritic, occurring with coughing.  No sick
contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] international travel.  The patient was started
on a five day course of Azithromycin for treatment of
bronchitis versus viral pneumonia.  The patient reports that
she has had viral pneumonia six times in the past 40 years.
She received Pneumo-Vax immunization two years ago.

The patient flew from [**State 108**] to [**Location (un) 86**] about five days prior
to admission and worsening non productive cough on
antibiotics.  She developed low grade fevers to 100 to 100.5
and worsening dyspnea on exertion.  Chest pain was unchanged.
She saw her local physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] x-ray done per husband
reports a right lower lobe pneumonia and pleural effusion.
White count of 14.8.  The patient was then started on
Moxifloxicin.

One day prior to admission, the patient's symptoms worsened
and she spiked a temperature to 102 and had shaking chills.
She presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **].

Outside hospital temperature was 98.4.  Pulse was 104.
Respiratory rate of 20.  Oxygen saturation 94%.  Blood
pressure 120/54.  Chest x-ray showing worsening pneumonia in
right middle lobe and right lower lobe.  White blood cell
count of 25.  The patient was started on Vancomycin and
Ceftazidime.

The patient underwent ultrasound guided thoracentesis for
small pleural effusion, with only 3 cc of fluid aspirated,
which was hazy, yellow pleural fluid; however, pH was 6.89;
glucose of 46; total protein of 4.5; LDH of 388.  White count
to 600; red count of 20,000 with 92 neutrophils, 4 lymphs, 4
monos.

Pleural fluid culture was sent and did not grow any
organisms.

Infectious disease was consulted and the patient's
antibiotics were changed to Vancomycin and Ciprofloxacin.
Given low pH of pleural fluid and concerns for empyema,
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for thoracic surgery evaluation.

On admission, CT scan of chest obtained showed one moderate
sized, multi-loculated right pleural effusion with slight
thickening of pleural rind, concerning for empyema.  Patchy,
peripheral consolidation of right lower lobe, as well as more
diffuse ground glass opacity, consistent with pneumonia.
Right hilar lymphadenopathy as well as slightly enlarged
nodes in the zygoesophageal recess, may be reactive
peripheral ground glass opacities in left upper lobe.  Two
small left lower lobe lung nodules.  One contains component
of calcification and an empyema.  Of note, the patient
reports a CT of chest was obtained [**11-10**], prior to head
surgery, and was normal.

The patient underwent pig tail catheter into right thoracic
space with 100 cc of straw-colored fluid removed.  Catheter
was maneuvered in an attempt to direct as many loculations as
possible.  Gram stain showing 3+ PNM's, no micro-organisms.
Fluid was sent for culture.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 12 mg p.o. q. day.  Zestril
10 mg p.o. q. day.  Multi-vitamins.  Calcium 150 mg p.o. q.
day.  [**Last Name (un) **]-Pro times 20 years for osteoporosis prevention.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension. History of tuberculosis
in [**2087**], treated for two years with Streptomycin and PF.
Status post wedge resection with phrenic nerve injury in
[**2087**].  History of spondylosis, status post spinal fusion in
[**2109**].  Hospital course complicated by meningitis and spinal
leak.  Bronchoalveolar lung cancer, status post right upper
lobe lobectomy, [**2-9**], followed by XRT for three months,
finished in [**5-11**], with reported negative chest CT on [**9-10**].
Bilateral hip replacements for osteoarthritis in [**12-12**] and
[**9-10**].  Cutaneous porfira tarda, diagnosed in [**2129**], treated
with phlebotomy.  Status post appendectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lived in [**Location **], [**State 350**]. Moved to
[**State 108**] about five years ago.  Patient lives with husband who
is a retired family physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 20282**] have four children.  30
year tobacco history, quit in [**2118**].  Ethanol, 14 glasses of
wine a week.  Had walked two miles a day prior to hip
surgery. The patient reports six episodes of pneumonia over
the last 30 years, although one was viral.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
afebrile, temperature 99.1; heart rate 89 to 102; blood
pressure 120 to 160 over 63 to 90; respiratory rate 20 to 22;
oxygen saturation 97% on two liters.  Weight is 43 kilograms.
General:  Awake, alert, breathing comfortably, in no apparent
distress.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx
moist.  No buccal lesions. Neck supple.  Heart regular rate,
tachycardia at 100, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:
Positive bronchial breath sounds and egophony at right
breast.  Pigtail catheter in place on the right side.  Left
diffuse sub crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, non
distended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  no edema or
clubbing.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves 2 through 12 intact.
Strength 5/5 proximally and distally.  Sensation grossly
normal to light touch.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 20.  Hematocrit of 29.
Platelets of 637.  92 neutrophils, 3 lymphs, 3 monos, 3
eosinophils.  Sodium of 134; potassium of 4.4 and chloride of
103.  Bicarbonate of 22.  BUN of 9.  Creatinine of 0.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was initially admitted to the
medical service, with the history as described above.
However, she was then transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit on [**2136-12-1**] because of an episode of tachypnea and
respiratory distress, in the context of an examination
showing diffuse wheezing and prolonged inspiratory to
expiratory ratio.

INITIAL IMPRESSION:  The initial impression was that the
patient was having some component of reactive airway disease,
which responded to a combined treatment.  Low on the
differential was a possible congestive heart failure.  The
patient was treated for both.  She received Lasix and
nitrates and had some relief of symptoms.  She also was
treated with nebulizers.

The patient ultimately stabilized of the Neonatal Intensive
Care Unit day one on [**12-1**].  Later in the day, the patient
had worsening respiratory distress, requiring intubation.
Her arterial blood gases at the time was 6.95, 76 and 102.

The patient then received a bronchoscopy.  It was felt that
the patient had significant secretions and may have had an
episode of mucus plugging and causing her desaturations and
hypocarbic arrest. The patient was noted to have a very small
airway and a #6 endotracheal tube was placed.

Results of bronchoscopy on [**2136-12-3**] revealed patent trachea,
main right stem and right upper lobe bronchus are patent;
right bronchus intermedius was patent and there were no
masses visible.  Right middle lobe was patent.  Minimal to
moderate amounts of white secretion. Right upper lobe
bronchus was patent and visualized with anterior apical and
post bronchial right lower lobe was also patent.

The patient was transiently on Dopamine for an episode of
hypotension, though she had a brief episode of atrial
fibrillation on transfer to the Intensive Care Unit.  She
remained hemodynamically stable and out of atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was weaned to pressure support
ventilation by [**2136-12-4**] but had increased tachypnea with
decreased pressor support.

Chest x-rays showed persistent middle and right lower lobe
infiltrates; no significant effusion and also left upper lobe
infiltrate.  C
