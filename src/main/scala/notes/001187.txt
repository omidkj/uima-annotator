Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Atorvastatin / Celebrex

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83-year-old woman with chronic diastolic CHF
(LVH, EF 75%), chronic atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation,
severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and metastatic thyroid cancer undergoing
cyberknife therapy, who presents to the ED today with complaints
of 20-pound weight gain over the last two weeks and increasing
shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and PND.
She denies any palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. She was
evaluated by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] on [**2175-11-6**], at which
point her digoxin was stopped due to her normal EF and her
Lopressor was changed to Toprol XL and the dose was doubled. She
subsequently has been undergoing CyberKnife therapy for her
metastatic thyroid cancer, completing treatment [**4-16**] today. She
complained of progressive symptoms and was referred in to the ED
for further evaluation.
.
In the ED: VS - HR 130s, BP 80/54, Weight 148lbs (up from
124lbs). Her baseline SBPs are known to be in the 100s. ECG
showed AFib w/ RVR. CXR showed no significant effusion,
pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. She had a shock ultrasound
that was negative and was started on Neosynephrine for her
hypotension. She received Ceftriaxone as empiric coverage given
concern for sepsis contributing to her hypotension and possible
underlying pneumonia. She was seen by the CCU team in the ED and
started on an Esmolol drip and IV Digoxin. Esmolol and
Neosynephrine were titrated up and she received 1 more dose of
IV Digoxin. She was also hypoxic, with room air ABG 7.35/51/61.
She did not tolerate BiPAP so she was transitioned to NRB. She
is being admitted to the CCU for further care.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

CARDIOLOGY:
.
EKG [**2175-12-11**]
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Right axis
deviation.
Low limb lead QRS voltage. RSR' pattern in lead VI. Persistent
prominent
S waves in the left precordial leads. Modest right precordial
lead T wave
changes. Findings are consistent with right ventricular
hypertrophy/right
ventricular overload. Clinical correlation is suggested. No
previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
TTE [**2175-12-12**]
IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated right ventricle with moderate
global hypokinesis and relative sparing of the basal right
ventricular segments. Preserved left ventricular regional and
global systolic function. Severe diastolic dysfunction. Moderate
to severe pulmonary hypertension. Mild aortic and moderate
mitral regurgitation.
.
.
RADIOLOGY:
CXR ([**2175-12-12**]):
FINDINGS: Large right thyroid masses again appreciated with
calcification and leftward deviation of the trachea. Numerous
rounded masses within the chest bilaterally are again depicted
consistent with known metastatic disease. No significant
effusion or pneumothorax is detected. Double density with regard
to the cardiac shadow is consistent with a large hiatal hernia.
No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia is detected.
.
CTA Chest ([**2175-12-13**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism. Large pulmonary artery measuring 3.4
cm, greater
than the aorta. The heart is enlarged with large atria
bilaterally, right
ventricle greater than the left, although this has not changed
in appearance since [**8-14**]. Septal thickening consistent with fluid overload.
3. Large pleural effusions, right greater than left, much worse
than in
[**Month (only) **]. Significant right and left lower lobe atelectasis.
4. Numerous metastatic pulmonary nodules as before.
5. Hiatal hernia.
.
CT Chest ([**12-21**]): pending
