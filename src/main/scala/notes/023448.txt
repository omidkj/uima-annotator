SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired, quit tobacco five years ago with a

FAMILY HISTORY:  Diabetes, neck cancer, congestive heart

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit and his hospital course was significant for the
following issues.

1.  GI:  The patient underwent nasogastric lavage, which was
negative for blood.  He was transfused to keep the hematocrit
greater then 30 and was started on intravenous proton pump
inhibitor.  He was prepped for esophagogastroduodenoscopy and
colonoscopy.  His diuretics and antihypertensives were held.
A GI consult was obtained and esophagogastroduodenoscopy was
done on [**2165-12-6**] and positive for a small hiatal hernia,
erythema and friability in the antrum compatible with
gastritis, celiac disease and otherwise normal
esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the third part of the duodenum.
A colonoscopy performed on [**12-7**] showed stool in the
transverse colon and ascending colon, diverticulosis of the
sigmoid colon and descending colon, grade one internal
hemorrhoids, melena was noted in the right side of the colon
and this raised the question of whether the bleeding source
was an upper gastrointestinal bleed.  There was no red blood
seen in the colon.  There was no active bleeding seen in the
colon.  The patient was transfused a total of 3 units of
packed red blood cells and he was called out of the Intensive
Care Unit and sent to the floor on [**2165-12-8**] where he
continued to have guaiac positive stool, but his hematocrit
remained stable.  His diet was advanced and he tolerated a
gluten free cardiac diet for several days prior to discharge
with no further evidence of bleeding.  An MRI/MRA to rule out
aorta enteric fistula was not obtained since the patient had
recent catheterization with stent placement.  This can be
done as an outpatient if clinically indicated.  The patient
should also follow up with GI to have a small bowel series as
the likely source of bleeding with a small bowel AVM.  Prior
to discharge the patient was seen by physical therapy who
recommended short term rehab stay.

2.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient is status post
coronary artery bypass graft and PCI.  Despite the
gastrointestinal bleed he was continued on aspirin and Plavix
per discussion with gastrointestinal and cardiology.  the
patient had no evidence of active ischemia.

3.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient was noted to have
a systolic dysfunction with an EF of 35%.  No evidence of
decompensated failure on examination.  Prior to discharge to
the floor the patient was noted to have some rales on
examination and shortness of breath, which improved with
Lasix.  He was gently diuresed.  O2 was weaned and the
patient was off oxygen satting well on room air for several
days prior to discharge.  The patient was continued on his
medications.

4.  Hypertension:  Prior to leaving the Intensive Care Unit
the patient was noted to have high blood pressures, which
required Labetalol drip.  Upon transfer to the floor he was
restarted on his home blood pressure medications,  His blood
pressure remained on the low side and medications were
titrated accordingly.  He remained on Metoprolol, Hydralazine
and Isosorbide for blood pressure control.

5.  Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient with increased
creatinine since his discharge status post coronary artery
bypass graft and received large doses of dye in previous
catheterizations.  Nephro toxic medications were avoided.
The patient was noted to have eosinophils in his urine
perhaps consistent with cholesterol emboli.  Upon transfer to
the floor his creatinine increased slightly with diuresis.
Once the congestive heart failure had improved the diuretics
were discontinued and his creatinine began to trend back
down.

6.  Rash:  Once transferred to the floor the patient
developed a macular papular rash on his chest.  No new
medications had been started.  The patient was given Sarna
lotion and the rash continued to improve prior to discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good, ambulating with assistance and
oxygenating well off oxygen.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Short term rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Gastrointestinal bleed.
2.  Anemia.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post aortobifemoral
bypass.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Allopurinol 100 mg po q.o.d.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
3.  Isosorbide dinitrate 40 mg t.i.d.
4.  Atorvastatin calcium 80 mg po q day.
5.  Metoprolol 50 mg po b.i.d.
6.  Clopidogrel 75 mg po q day.
7.  Temazepam 15 mg q.h.s. prn.
8.  Sertraline 50 mg po q day.
