Admission Date:  [**2175-11-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2175-11-13**]


Service:  .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft surgery, severe aortic stenosis
and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction the week
prior to admission, which was complicated by congestive heart
failure with the ejection fraction in the 30s.  At that time,
his aortic valve area was noted to be 0.5 cm squared.  The
patient initially refused cardiac catheterization, pacemaker
and anti-coagulation at the outside hospital and was
discharged to home to return the next day with shortness of
breath at rest.  He was noted to have a systolic blood
pressure in the 80s; temperature 100.6 F., with a right lower
lobe infiltrate found on chest x-ray.

He again ruled in for myocardial infarction and was started
treatment with antibiotics, heparin drip and Natrecor.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**],
initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service and taken for cardiac
catheterization.

Catheterization revealed severe three vessel disease and
severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction with patent graft.
The patient also had critical aortic stenosis, severe
pulmonary hypertension and a successful balloon valvuloplasty
bringing the aortic valve area from 0.5 cm squared to 0.7 cm
squared.  The patient was started on Dobutamine in the
catheterization laboratory and was transferred to the Cardiac
Care Unit.

Cardiac output on dobutamine was 2.88 and did not
significantly change after the dobutamine was stopped.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2167**] with left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to the left
circumflex and obtuse marginal ramus, and saphenous vein
graft to the right coronary artery.
2.  Severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.5 cm
squared.
3.  Tachycardia / Bradycardia syndrome.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.
6.  Asthma.
7.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of
30%.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
10. Hyperlipidemia.
11. Diabetes mellitus type 2.
12. History of urinary tract infection.
13. Status post transurethral resection of the prostate.
14. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Captopril 6.25 mg twice a day.
2.  Augmentin twice a day.
3.  Lasix 60 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Pravachol 60 mg p.o. q. day.
8.  Atrovent and Albuterol inhalers.
9.  Flovent inhaler.

ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home; denies alcohol or
tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 100.4 F.;
pulse 69; blood pressure 105/38; respiratory rate 22;
saturation of 99% on a non-rebreather.  Generally, the
patient is confused, moving around in bed.  He had a jugular
venous pressure of 7 cm with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur
heard at the right upper sternal border.  On lung examination
he had diffuse wheezes and crackles at bases.  The rest of
his examination was unremarkable.

LABORATORY:  On admission showed a BUN and creatinine of 48
and 1.9.  Troponin T was 2.38 and CK 40.

EKG pre-cath showed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 60 beats
per minute, left axis deviation, right bundle branch block
with ST depressions in V1 through V6.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred post
catheterization to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.
[**Unit Number **].  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  Catheterization revealed severe
three vessel disease with patent graft.  The patient was
status post two recent non-ST elevation myocardial
infarctions.  To continue on aspirin and Pravachol.
Initially, his beta blocker was held secondary to hypotension
and presumed cardiogenic shock, however, his beta blocker,
ACE inhibitor and digoxin were started prior to discharge
without complications.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient was shown to have
an ejection fraction of 30% with severe biventricular
diastolic dysfunction and a very low cardiac output.  He was
resumed on his home Lasix dose as well as his home ACE
inhibitor and beta blocker and was felt to be euvolemic by
the time of discharge.

3.  SICK SINUS SYNDROME:  The patient continues to refuse a
pacemaker and while in-house he became bradycardic at times,
but was otherwise in regular rate in his atrial fibrillation.

4.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient continues to refuse
anti-coagulation and remained in atrial fibrillation.  He is
continued on Carvedilol for multiple indications, one of
which is for rate control.

5.  ASTHMA / QUESTION OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY
DISEASE:  The patient was continued on oxygen via nasal
cannula.  He continued to saturate well throughout his
admission as long as he was on two or three liters which he
states is his home dose of oxygen.  He was also continued on
Atrovent and Albuterol nebulizers and transitioned over to
inhalers by the end of his hospital stay as well as his
Flovent inhaler.

6.  PNEUMONIA:  The patient had been treated with Levaquin
for two days followed by Caveats and Clindamycin for two days
at the outside hospital.  He was continued on Ceftriaxone
while here for a total of a ten day course.  He appeared to
improve in his oxygen saturation and his sputum production
decreased by the time of discharge with no complications.

7.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was initially started on
a Regular insulin sliding scale, however, his blood sugar
remained less than 150 at all times, so the Regular insulin
sliding scale was stopped prior to discharge.

8.  CODE STATUS:  The patient remained "DO NOT RESUSCITATE"
and "DO NOT INTUBATE" throughout his hospital stay.

9.  MENTAL STATUS:  On admission, the patient appeared
confused and continued to do so throughout his hospital stay.
Likely that this patient has a baseline dementia, however,
due to this, he is having difficulty swallowing.  He was
evaluated by the Speech and Swallow Team on the day of
discharge who recommended that the patient not take anything
by mouth until his mental status clears.  If this does not
happen, then he should be started on tube feeds and a PEG
tube should be considered as he is a very high aspiration
risk.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Carbuterol 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Lasix 60 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Captopril 6.25 mg p.o. three times a day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. h.s.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Flovent two puffs twice a day.
8.  Risperidone 0.5 mg p.o. twice a day p.r.n.
9.  Atrovent nebulizers q. six hours.
10. Albuterol nebulizers q. six hours.
11. Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
12. Senokot one to two tablets p.o. q. day p.r.n.
13. Heparin subcutaneously 5000 units q. eight hours until
ambulating.

throughout this entire admission.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Follow-up appointments to be
determined.
