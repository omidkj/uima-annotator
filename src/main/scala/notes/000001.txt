.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)
IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of
obstruction.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. High grade small-bowel obstruction. Unusual configuration of
a loop of small bowel in the mid abdomen is concerning for
closed loop obstruction. There is a moderate amount of free
fluid within the abdomen.
2. Ill-defined opacity in the right middle lobe representing
infection or BAC and should be further evaluated with PET CT.
3. Thickening of the first portion of the duodenum, of uncertain
clinical significance.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2145-4-2**] 1:51 PM
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe airspace opacity, which could
represent pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. Small
bilateral pleural effusions. Followup to assure resolution is
recommended.
.
CT Chest [**2145-4-2**]
IMPRESSION:
1. New right lower lobe pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural
effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
2. Ill-defined opacity in the right middle lobe representing
either infection or BAC and should be further evaluated once
acute issues resolve.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
4. Small mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, which do not meet
CT criteria for pathologically enlargement.

CXR [**2145-4-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving airspace consolidation in the right lower lung
field consistent with resolving pneumonia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted through the emergency room on [**2145-3-31**] and
taken to the operating room. She underwent an uncomplicated
exploratory laparatomy for small bowel resection, jejunosotomy
and lysis of adhesions, see op report for details. She was
stabilized in the PACU, and transferred to SICU on POD#1. She
was extubated, her pain was well controlled with morphine PCA,
she remained NPO with NGT and foley catheter. She was initiated
on Cefazolin/Flagyl x 24 hours.

POD#2 she developed confusion and decreased oxygen saturation,
requiring 3L nasal cannula. Narcotics were stopped, CXR and CT
of chest were obtained and revealed right lower lobe pneumonia,
see pertinent results for details. Vanc/Levo/Flagyl were
initiated as well as an ID and medicine consult. She was
transferred to SICU. POD#[**4-4**] she remained in SICU, her mental
status and respiratory status improved. POD#4 her NGT was
removed and she was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9, she was weaned to
room air. Her pain was well controlled with tylenol and small
doses of oxycodone. POD#5 she reported flatus followed by
multiple loose stools. Stool for C diff was negative. She was
started on sips, and tolerated it easily. POD#6 she tolerated
clear liquids but no longer wanted to take antibiotics due to
frequent stools. CXR was repeated which showed resolving
pneumonia. She tolerated a regular diet in the evening without
difficulty. Infectious disease team recommended completion of 7
days of Levofloxacin. Clips were removed on POD#7, she was
discharged home in stable condition with antibiotics, pain
medication and all appropriate follow up appointments.
