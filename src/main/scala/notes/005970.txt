HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old male with
a recent right ankle fracture who underwent an open reduction
and internal fixation on [**2189-9-4**], with a history of
peripheral vascular disease and a right popliteal to DP
bypass in [**2182**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**]. The patient presents from an
outside hospital with severe right lower extremity deformity
at the ankle with necrosis at the ankle and cool foot. Per
[**Hospital6 **], the patient fell and twisted the
ankle 4 days prior to admission. He then went to his
orthopedist today for his foot which had become purple. It
was noted to be pulseless and cool, and the patient had
closed reduced ankle fracture about 50%. The patient is
without pain. The patient was transferred here for further
evaluation by the orthopedic and vascular services.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa causes confusion and delirium.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Coumadin 2.5 mg daily, sublingual
Nitroglycerin p.r.n., Vicodin p.r.n. for pain, Trazodone 200
mg at h.s., Protonix 40 mg daily, Ativan 0.5 mg t.i.d.
p.r.n., lisinopril 5 mg b.i.d., Zoloft 100 mg daily, Coreg
3.125 mg daily, Imdur 30 mg daily, Renaphro 1 g daily,
gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d., clonazepam 1 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.,
Pravachol 20 mg at h.s., Plavix 75 mg daily, folate 2 mg
daily, Lasix 80 mg daily, Senokot p.r.n., NPH insulin 15
units q.a.m. with a sliding scale.

PAST ILLNESSES:  End-stage renal disease on dialysis Monday,
Wednesday and Friday; coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery angioplasty with a history of congestive
heart failure; peripheral vascular disease, status post
bilateral lower extremity bypasses; diabetes mellitus type 2
with neuropathy, retinopathy and end-stage renal disease;
hypercholesteremia on a statin; anemia, chronic;
hyperparathyroidism, treated; depression on medication; a
right ankle fracture with open reduction and internal
fixation; atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 98.2, 82, 26, O2
saturation 100% on 3 L, blood pressure 144/68. General: No
acute distress. Carotids 2+ without bruits. Heart: Regular,
irregular rhythm. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended. Pulse exam: Palpable distal
grafts bilaterally. The right lower extremity is with a gross
deformity at the ankle with a necrotic region over the medial
malleolus. There is no signal. The foot is mottled. The graft
is palpable in the anterior tibial area but absent below the
injured area.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
emergency room. He was seen by ortho-trauma. The ex-fix was
removed. The patient was begun on vancomycin, Cipro and
Flagyl. Subcu heparin was begun for DVT prophylaxis and the
patient was continued on Plavix.

The patient did well after his external ex-fix. He did
require 1 unit of FFP for an INR of 2.3. renal was consulted
for hemodialysis needs who determined that the patient will
require a right BKA. Serial CKs were monitored.

The patient was evaluated preoperatively by the cardiology
service. It was thought that he would be at moderately high
risk but given that the amputation is emergent we should
proceed with surgery as most recent echocardiogram result
were done at outside and they were not available.

The patient had a diagnostic arteriogram of the right lower
extremity via the left common femoral approach. It was
determined that the patient was nonreconstructible and would
require BKA. The patient underwent a right BKA on [**2189-12-2**]. The patient's intraoperative course was complicated
by ventricular fibrillation, PE arrest. The patient was
resuscitated and transferred to the SICU for continued. care.
Intraoperative TEE showed a clot in the RV which was TPA
bolused and infused. The patient remained intubated and
neurologically he was below baseline. A head CT was obtained
which was unremarkable for acute event. Chest x-ray showed a
moderate right-sided pleural effusion with atelectasis.
Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 55%. There was no clot noted.

The patient remained in the ICU. He required multiple
transfusions for postoperative anemia. On postoperative day
3, hematocrit was 29.0, white count 8.7, BUN 31, creatinine
4.1, potassium 3.9.

The patient was extubated on [**12-6**] without incident. He
continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU later
that day. The patient was tolerating diet. His confusion had
improved. Antibiotics were discontinued. His IV heparin,
Coumadin conversion was instituted.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2189-12-7**].
Physical therapy was requested to see the patient for
assessment for discharge planning. Rehab screening was
instituted. He continues to be mildly disoriented but at
baseline. Hematocrit is stable at 27.4, BUN 22, creatinine
3.4. Geriatric nurse consult was done on [**2189-12-8**],
regarding skin changes. The patient has stage 1 sacral
decubitus changes. An air bed was ordered. DuoDerm was placed
on the infected area and should be changed every 3 days.

Because of his delirium the nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) 3675**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 24676**] techniques and continue encouraging ambulation
to chair. The amputation site is clean, dry and intact. There
is some mild ecchymosis on the medial aspect of the superior
flap but no skin degradation.

The patient will be discharged to rehab when a bed is
available and when he is medically stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Artificial tears with lanolin
ophthalmic ointment p.r.n., pravastatin 20 mg daily, folic
acid 2 mg daily, senna tablets 8.6 mg b.i.d. as needed,
Nitroglycerin sublingual 0.3 mg tablets p.r.n., lorazepam 0.5
mg tablets at bed time p.r.n., Trazodone 100 mg at bed time,
Zoloft 100 mg daily, warfarin 2.5 mg daily, metoprolol
tartrate 12.5 mg t.i.d., aspirin 81 mg daily, simvastatin 10
mg daily, oxycodone/acetaminophen elixir 5-10 cc q.4-6 hours
p.r.n., Protonix 40 mg daily.

The patient's right IJ will remain in place until discharge
since he has poor peripheral access.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ischemic right foot, status post open reduction and
    internal fixation of right ankle for fracture with
    recurrent falls and injury, ischemic right foot.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
    infarction.
3.  History of congestive heart failure.
4.  History of type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent.
5.  History of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis
    Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
6.  History of hyperlipidemia on statin.
7.  History of chronic anemia on Epogen at dialysis.
8.  History of atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated.
9.  History of depression.
10. History of hyperparathyroidism, treated.
11. Right ventricular thrombus by TEE on [**12-3**].
12. Postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused.
13. Intraoperative ventricular fibrillation arrest,
    resuscitated.
14. PEA arrest, resuscitated.
15. Pulmonary embolus postoperatively.
16. Stage 1 sacral decubitus ulceration.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should followup with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 3 weeks post discharge, call for an appointment
at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1393**]. The patient should not have any stump
shrinkers applied to the amputation wound. Please notify his
office for fever greater than 101.5 or the wound shows
changes consistent with infection.
