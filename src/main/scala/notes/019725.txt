Imaging:
CXR [**5-31**]:
FINDINGS:  Prior to the most recent prior radiograph, there are
increased opacities in the right lower lobe which may be
consistent with infectious etiology.   Additionally, there are
some increased opacities in the left mid lung which also may be
concerning for infectious process.  The lungs remain
hyperinflated.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  A
stent is seen within the left main stem bronchus.  No evidence
of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Increased opacities in the right lower lobe and left middle
lung may represent infectious process.

CXR [**6-2**]:
Probable background hyperinflation.  Again seen is extensive
parenchymal opacity. The right base opacity may be slightly
improved compared with [**2175-5-31**].  Left main stem bronchus stent is
no longer seen on this study.  Otherwise, no significant
interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
75F with Wegener's granulomatosis and polyangitis c/b
tracheobronchial disease and bilateral bronchial stenosis s/p
dilations and intralesional steroid injections presetning with
SOB s/p elective bronchoscopy.

# Shortness of breath - Patient arrived to MICU on BiPap with
respiratory distress after elective bronchosopy.  This procedure
was scheduled for routine followup s/p stenting of her LMS on
[**1-2**] and repeat BAL/bronch on [**4-3**].  She was weaned to face
tent immediately on arrival to MICU and tolerated this well.
Frank pus was visualized in LLL on bronchoscopy and CXR was
concerning for PNA.  Patient was therefore empirically started
on vanc/zosyn. Underwent repeat rigid and flexible bronchoscopy
with foreign body removal (LMS stent), tumor ablation via
electrocautery, and cryodebridement as well as mechanical
debridement with flexible forceps. She also recieved
intralesional injection of methylprednisolone acetate in 1cc
aliquots of a 40mg/mL solution to 2 affected areas.
Post-procedure, the patient was extubated and monitored in the
MICU for 2 days with stabilization of respiratory function. The
patient was subsequently transferred to the general medical
floor.

Shortly after arriving to the floor, she was weaned to her home
2L NC.  The night of [**6-3**] she had an episode of pink-tinged
sputum production, however this was
