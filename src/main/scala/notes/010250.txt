CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post right middle lobe bronchus
stent removal with hemoptysis/airway secretion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 53-year-old female with
past medical history significant for Stage III-B nonsmall
cell lung cancer diagnosed in fall of [**2142**] with recurrent C,
Factor VIII deficiency, and epilepsy, who presents with
hemoptysis, and excessive secretions status post right main
bronchus stent removal.  Originally patient was diagnosed
with nonsmall cell lung cancer in fall of [**2142**], and was
treated with XRT and chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol.
Her disease reoccurred in [**2143-5-5**], and she was again
treated with XRT with minimal response.  The lung cancer had
then progressed.

On [**2145-5-3**], the patient underwent bronchoscopy (via cytology
revealed nonsmall cell lung cancer) with stent placement in
the bronchus intermedius.  Poststent CT demonstrated adequate
placement.  However, the patient was unable to tolerate the
stent with persistent cough and increased secretions.  She
presents today for elective stent removal.  The procedure was
complicated by 150 cc of hemoptysis poststent removal which
was controlled with suctioning and airway protection.

On arrival, the patient complains of shortness of breath with
increased nonbloody secretions which is improved with
nebulized lidocaine.  She also complains of mild anterior
right chest discomfort which is chronic and pleuritic.  She
denies any nausea, vomiting, headache, chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Stage III-B (T4 M0 N0) nonsmall cell lung cancer diagnosed
in fall of [**2142**] treated with carboplatin/Taxol induction with
low dose XRT.  She also had a second XRT treatment in [**2143-5-5**] and had suffered some radiation pneumonitis.
2. Catanenial epilepsy treated in [**2134**].
3. Factor VIII deficiency.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Klonopin 0.25 mg po q4h, 0.5 mg po q hs.
2. Estrogen 0.3 mg po q day.
3. Progesterone 200 mg po q day.
4. Albuterol prn.

ALLERGIES:  Chemical sensitivity to quinolones, macrolides,
aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and penicillin.
She develops hives with levofloxacin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married with two children.  She has a
30 pack year smoking history, who quit in [**2142-9-4**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with lung cancer and hemophilia,
maternal grandmother with breast cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAM UPON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  144/81, 100% on
face mask, respiratory rate 34, pulse of 133, temperature
96.5.  Generally, this is a white female in mild distress,
appearing anxious.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae with clear dry
oropharynx.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Neck
is supple without lymphadenopathy.  Pulmonary:  Decreased
breath sounds in the right base [**4-6**] of the way up with some
bronchial breath sounds, egophony, and decreased tactile
fremitus.  The left lung is clear to auscultation.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardia, normal S1, S2.  No murmurs or
thrills noted.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema noted.  Neurological:  Alert and oriented
times three and moving all four extremities.

LABORATORIES UPON ADMISSION:  White count is 7.1, hematocrit
31.7, platelets 584.  Sodium 136, potassium 4, chloride 98,
bicarb 21, BUN 10, creatinine 0.4, glucose 144, calcium 9.1,
magnesium 1.5, phosphate is 3.9.  Bronchial brushing showed a
positive sample of nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.  Pleural
fluid on [**5-3**] show reactive mesothelial cells and no
malignant cells.  On [**2145-4-5**] chest CT scan status post stent
showed stent in the right upper lobe bronchus marked with
narrowing of origin in the right middle bronchus, moderate
pericardial effusion, small partial loculated right pleural
effusion, right middle lobe opacity, and diffuse emphysema.

A [**2145-5-21**] chest x-ray showed moderate large right pleural
effusion, new consistent with compared with chest x-ray on
[**2145-5-7**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary - Hemoptysis:  Patient was initially admitted to
the Intensive Care Unit to keep her saturation above 92%.
Her secretions and cough were managed with Fentanyl and
saline nebulizer treatments.  She did not have any episode of
hemoptysis while in the Intensive Care Unit, and actually
came down from her oxygen requirement from 100% nonrebreather
to sating 90% 4-5 liters. Her hematocrit remained stable.
She was called out to the floor where she was quite stable
until the second day on the medical floor, where she then
experienced three tablespoons of hemoptysis.  She was then
transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
observation.  Her hematocrit remained stable and her
hemoptysis decreased in frequency from seven episodes a day
to just five episodes a day with sputum production consistent
with a rust colored phlegm.  She had no frank hemoptysis
while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  She was then
called out to the medical floor where she soon had greater
than 150 cc hemoptysis.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was aggressively attempted that
the patient could not be revived.  Her airway could not be
managed with the blood that was aspirated during her episode
of hemoptysis.  The code was finally called off at 2 am on
[**2145-6-1**] with pronunciation of death secondary to aspiration
from hemoptysis.

In regards to her pulmonary effusion, it was thought that
there was no need for a thoracentesis at this time.  If the
patient was to spike a fever, the Pulmonary team would
consider thoracentesis, however, she never did spike a fever.

2. Infectious Disease:  The patient did have [**4-6**] blood
cultures on [**2145-5-26**] and sputum that grew out MSSA.  She was
initially treated with Vancomycin 1 gram [**Hospital1 **] and continued on
Vancomycin given that she might develop sensitivities to
other types of antibiotics and the fact that she was
tolerating Vancomycin quite well.  Given that her Vancomycin
trough was less than 10, her dosage was increased to 1250 mg
IV bid of the Vancomycin.  A transesophageal echocardiogram
was never done because the patient requested that she have
some time to recover from her hemoptysis.

3. Nonsmall cell lung cancer:  The patient was initially
going to be setup for phototherapy.  However, before this
could be attempted, it was felt that her lung cancer had
eroded into pulmonary arteries leading to the hemoptysis
which eventually led to her death.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Death secondary to aspiration from hemoptysis from
nonsmall lung cancer eroding to pulmonary arteries.
2. Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
3. Nonsmall cell lung cancer.

DATE OF DEATH:  [**2145-6-1**] at 2 am.
