History of Present Illness:
This is a 19 year old female with minimal past medical history
who presented to the ED with back and chest pain and shortness
of breath of one days duration. She had been standing on a chair
using a drill two days prior to presentation when she fell
backwards onto her back. She had immediate pain and then this
improved. The following day, however, which was the day prior to
presentation she was bothered by intermittent shortness of
breath and pleuritic chest pain (worst in her left shoulder and
substernal). She also was having subjective fevers and chills.
This pain was fairly moderate so she managed to go about most of
her normal behaviors. Unfortunately,the following morning she
was awoken very early with quite severe chest and left shoulder
pain that continued to be worse with deep breaths. Thus, she
went into the emergency department at approximately 3 am on
[**2170-8-28**] for further evaluation. In the ED initial vital signs
were T 100.8, P 124, BP 153/96, RR 26, O2 Sat 97% on RA. A work
up was begun for musculoskeletal causes of chest and back pain
including CXR, CT scan of L and C spines, CT Head, and
radiograph of the left shoulder. These were all benign on prelim
reads and the plan was to discharge the patient after obtaining
adequate pain control. This proved difficult and per ED sign-out
the patient threatened to leave AMA multiple times over
frustrations with their efforts to control her pain. At
approximately 9:00 am a final read on the chest radiograph
suggested a retrocardiac opacity. The patient received a dose of
levofloxacin for presumed CAP then suddenly desaturated to 70%
on room air requiring transition to 6L of O2 by nasal cannula
(leading PO2 to increase to 85%) and then 100% NRB mask, which
brought sats to mid 90's. At this point repeat imaging revealed
an impressive left lower lobe infiltrate so the patient received
vancomycin and ceftriaxone before being admitted to the MICU.
Last set of vitals prior to transfer were HR 99, BP 108/59, RR
28, O2 Sat 94 % on 100% NRB.
At presentation to the ICU the patient was dyspneic and very
uncomfortable with any sort of inhalation. CTA was obtained to
rule out PE given tachycardia and pleuritic pain. This showed
dense symmetric posterior consolidations as well as other areas
of involvement suggestive of multifocal pneumonia. Given the
patient also complained of having developed rather severe
headache while in the ED and had diffuse myalgias there was
concern for H1N1 influenza so she received oseltamavir and
rimantidine for empiric coverage. The patient was intubated
shortly thereafter as she appeared to be tiring and also to
accomodate multiple needed procedures as she was extremely
uncomfortable with simple breathing even at rest.

Brief Hospital Course:
19 year old female presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure
in the context of fever, myalgias, and headache found to have
strep pne

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Patient presented with hypoxic
respiratory failure and fevers.  On presnetation had O2 sats in
the low to mid 90's on 100% nonrebreather and appeared to be
tiring.  PE was ruled out by CTA of the chest but the patient
had dense bilateral consolidations of the lower lobes.
Initially she received broad spectrum coverage with vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin.  Given myalgias and headache she
also received oseltamavir and rimantidine given concern for
influenza.  Given high O2 requirements, rapid progression of
infiltrates and respiratory failure, and appearance she was
tiring she was electively intubated on the day of presentation.
The following day she managed to maintain an adequate O2 sat on
minimal ventilator settings so she was extubated.  Blood
cultures were positive for streptococcus pneumoniae and
influenza antigen testing was negative so oseltamavir was
stopped on [**8-30**] and she was kept on vancomycin/ceftriaxone
because of concerns of meningitis.  Sensitivities from blood
cultures returned with pansensitive strep pneumoniae, patient
had no signs of meningismus and so vancomycin was discontinued.
Patient improved to saturating well on room air on IV
ceftriaxone.  She was discharged with oral levofloxacine to
complete a 2 week course of antibiotics and will follow up in [**Hospital **]
clinic.

2. Myalgias/Headache: Initially there was concern given the
patients myalgias and headache that despite obvious respiratory
process she could have meningitis.  Thus, she initially received
CNS doses of ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  There was minimal
suspicion of HSV encephalitis so no empiric IV acyclovir was
started.  LP was attempted on the night of admission but was
unable to be successfully obtained.  As blood cultures returned
positive for a common pulmonary pathogen and the index of
suspicion had always been quite low we decided not to reattempt
LP.

3. Iron Deficiency Anemia: Patient with indices consistent with
iron deficiency and anemia. Therefore, she was started on PO
iron and colace.  This should be closely monitored for recovery
as her previous gastric bypass makes her at high risk for iron
malabsorption.

4. PPX: She received SC heparin.  While intubated she received
H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis.
