Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3283**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension at HD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dialysis on [**3-25**]

History of Present Illness:
55F with ESRD on HD, PVD s/p R AKA, HTN, DM, presents with
hypotension at HD. Pt was feeling in her usual state of health
until she went to HD this morning. At HD, her BP was found to be
56/12. EMS was called and BP per the EMTs was 58/41. She was
brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
On arrival to the ED, vitals were T 97.6, BP 62/34, HR 72, RR
17, SaO2 98% 2L. SBP initially maintained in the 60s but
improved to 110s with manipulation on exam and attempts at IV
access. She was initially very lethargic, and then became
agitated, yelling out in pain. At best, she was answering yes/no
questions. CXR negative. CT abd/pelvis showed mild increase in R
pleural effusion but no acute intraabdominal process. Received
vanco, zosyn, and 200cc IVF. Admitted to the MICU for close
monitoring.

CXR:

1. Cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular engorgement, interstitial
edema, and bilateral pleural effusions are consistent with
volume overload.
2. Right lung base infiltrate. Please ensure follow-up to
clearance.
3. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.

CT abdomen:

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND RECONSTRUCTIONS: There has been
interval
increase in size to a small-to-moderate right simple pleural
effusion.
Bibasilar atelectasis is again demonstrated. Calcification of
the mitral
annulus and aortic valve is only partially visualized is of
unknown
hemodynamic significance. No pericardial effusion is
demonstrated. Right
atrial enlargement is again suspected.

No change is identified to the appearance of the liver.
Gallbladder is not
detected consistent with prior resection. The spleen is stable
on appearance with enhancing 1-cm rounded lesion in the inferior
pole consistent with a hemangioma or hamartoma. No change in an
8 x 10 mm left adrenal adenoma since [**2192-2-16**]. A small amount
of perihepatic fluid is again demonstrated, becoming confluent
with the right abdominal subcutaneous anasarca. Asymmetric
diffuse anasarca has been stable since at least 2/[**2191**]. No
evidence of bowel obstruction is demonstrated. Severe calcified
atherosclerotic plaque within the abdominal aorta, celiac axis,
SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] as well as iliac vessels again appreciated with
gross luminal patency.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST AND RECONSTRUCTIONS: Extensive vascular
calcifications in the pelvis. Rectum, sigmoid colon and
unopacified loops of small bowel appear stable. No diffuse free
pelvic fluid identified.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Extensive scoliosis and multilevel
degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:

Little change since prior study aside from increase in size to
moderate right pleural effusion. No evidence of new inflammatory
change or acute bowel pathology within the abdomen.


Brief Hospital Course:
55F with ESRD on HD, PVD s/p R AKA complicated by chronic
osteomyelitis, HTN, DM, was admitted to the ICU on [**3-23**] after
being found to be hypotensive and with altered mental status at
HD.
.
.
# Hypotension: BP normalized after only 250cc of fluid in the
ED. BP was only attainable using Doppler on right upper
extremity, with manual cuff, which brings into question accuracy
of previous BP recordings.  She was admitted to the ICU where
her blood pressure was 120s-140s systolic using the above
technique. She was afebrile, no leukocytosis, no acute process
on CXR or CT abd/pelvis.  However, she was covered empirically
with Vanco/Zosyn initially given her chronic osteo and history
of bacteremia.  This was later narrowed to vancomycin, as below.
 In the future, BP measurement should be done in right arm, with
manual cuff and doppler.
.
# Positive blood cultures:  Blood cultures showed 1/4 bottles
with gram positive cocci.  Zosyn was discontinued.  Vancomycin
was continued, and her line was changed over a wire. When her
blood cultures speciated as coagulase negative staph, this was
thought to most likely be a contaminant; however, given her
history of bacteremia the renal team elected to continue
vancomycin, to be dosed by level at HD for a total 3 week course
(16 more days).
.
# Altered mental status: Patient's mental status improved with
holding benzodiazepenes and narcotics. Per discussion with rehab
facility, patient has been receiving increased doses of
narcotics recently. As she was not having any pain, she was
discharged off all narcotics.  Benzodiazepenes and narcotics
should be avoided if possible in this patient.
.
# CAD: Troponins flat x 2, there was no chest pain, no EKG
changes. [**Month/Year (2) **], Plavix, and statin were continued. Of note, she is
not on a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor because of hypotension.

.
# ESRD on HD: There was no indication for urgent HD. Recently
had AV graft to upper left arm (lower left arm graft failed)
which was complicated by hematoma and perioperative NSTEMI. This
admission, the graft appeared intact, but she had a tunnelled
line that was used instead.  She had missed her recent Saturday
dialysis session [**3-23**]. She received HD on [**3-25**], but this was
limited by hypotension, so she underwent another session on [**3-26**]
and then ultrafiltration on [**3-27**].  Sevelamer, lanthanum, and
cinacalcet were continued.  She should now resume her outpatient
Tues/Thurs/Sat hemodialysis, next due [**3-28**].
.
# Chronic osteomyelitis: Followed in [**Hospital **] clinic. Currently taking
Doxycycline 100mg PO BID and rifampin 300mg PO bid for chronic
suppression of MRSA vertebral osteomyelitis (hardware in place)
for indefinite period of time. Doxycy
