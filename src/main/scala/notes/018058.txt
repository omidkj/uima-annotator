Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Positive stress-MIBI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
71yo M with HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, PVD, +tob and recent IMI
2 weeks ago presents for cardiac evaluation after positive
stress test today.  The pt is [**Name (NI) 595**] and speaks little English.
 History was obtained through translation via the patient's
daughter.  Over the past year the pt has developed increasing
DOE and claudication.  He currently developes these symptoms
after walking approximately one block.  The claudication is felt
bilaterally and improves with resting.  Approximately 2 weeks
prior to admission the patient experienced malaise one evening.
He denies having experienced CP, SOB, jaw pain, L arm pain,
diaphoresis or nausea at the time of his malaise.  Two to three
days afterward he was found to have new EKG changes consistent
with an IMI.  Approximately one week prior to admission the
patient had an echocardiogram which the patient's daughter said
was abnormal.  On the day of admission the patient had an
outpatient stress-MIBI which was abnormal and he was sent to the
ED.  The patient remained asymptomatic during his stress-MIBI
and denies having ever experienced CP, jaw pain, or L arm pain
with exertion.  In addition, he denies F/C/S, N/V/D, abdominal
pain, melena, hematochezia, recent weight changes, orthopnea,
PND and dysuria.
.
In the ED, the pt had the following VS: T99.5  P60  BP: 159/82
RR22  O2sat: 100% on 2L.  Pt was given 325mg ASA x1 and IV
metoprolol 5mg x1 with good response of his BP.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
[**2103-12-20**] ED EKG: Sinus, irregular, approx. 60bpm, nl axis, nl
PR, narrow QRS, nl QT, LAE seen in II, TWI in inferior leads,
lateral ST depressions (I, aVL, V4-V6)
.
CXR [**2103-12-20**]: no acute cardiopulmonary process
.
STRESS-MIBI [**2103-12-20**]:
STRESS: Ischemic EKG changes (3-4mm ST depressions) in the
setting of baseline abnormalities without anginal symptoms
.
MIBI:
1.  Severe, predominately reversible perfusion defects in the
anterior, septal and apical walls consistent with multivessel
ischemic disease.  Fixed perfusion defect at the base of the
inferior wall.
2.  Severe global hypokinesis with a calculated ejection
fraction of 27%.  Likely post stress ischemic dilation of the
left ventricular cavity.


Brief Hospital Course:
/P: 71yo M with recent silent IMI (cardiac risk factors include
known CAD, PVD, HTN, Hypercholesterolemia, +tob) presents for
evaluation after positive stress test.
.
1.  CV:
A.  Coronaries: The pt has known CAD with IMI in recent past.
Stress test was positive with reversible perfusion defects in
ant, septal and apical walls consistent with multivessel
ischemia as well as severe global HK.
---Telemetry and ECG in AM
---cycle CE x3 - if pt rules in, will start hep gtt and consider
GP IIB/IIIA inhibitor as well.
---Cath in AM - will d/w cards fellow re: white board.
---ASA 325mg once daily
---supplemental oxygen to obtain SaO2 of 100%
---metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] titrate up as tolerated
---start captopril 6.25mg TID titrate up as tolerated
---lipitor 80mg QHS - will also obtain lipid panel and LFT in
AM.
---hold Plavix given suggestion of multivessel ischemic disease
on MIBI and possibility of CABG in near future.
---pt is currently pain free, however if he were to develop sx
will start hep gtt and consider GPIIB/IIIA inhibitor as well.
.
B.  Pump: The pt has global HK with calculated EF of 27% on
MIBI.  This may reflect some element of myocardial stunning
after recent IMI and therefore may recover function with time.
Will aim for afterload reduction for now and follow signs and sx
of CHF.
---transition metoprolol short acting to toprol XL when at a
stable dose
---titrate up ACEI as tolerated.
---daily weights and ins/outs.
.
C.  Rhythm: The ECG has some evidence of sinus node dysfunction
and is concerning for wandering pace maker.
---telemetry
---cont. BB as above.
---discuss with cards re: significance of rhythm.

2.  Glaucoma: not an active issue, cont. eye drops.
---lumigan gtt
---cosopt gtt
The above hospital course pertains to the patient's stay while
on the medical service. On [**2103-12-25**] the patient was
taken to the OR for a 3 vessel CABG (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM, SVG
to PDA). The patient tolerated surgery well, was extubated the
night of surgery and was transferred from the CSRU on postop day
one to the regular cardiac hospital floor. On post op day two
the patient's foley was removed and with his chest tubes. On
post op day three the patient's pacing wires were removed. The
patient tolerated a cardiac heart healthy diet, diuresed well
after surgery while his pain was controlled throughout his
hospital stay. The patient was discharged on post op day five.
He will follow up with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 10 days for medication
adjustment if needed and routine blood work. Additionally, the
patient was cleared by physical therapy and he will be going
home with visiting nursing services to monitor his wounds,
assure medication compliance and check vital signs.
