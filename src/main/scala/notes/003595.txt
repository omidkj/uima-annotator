Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o male with Hepatitis C virus cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma is admitted for Orthotopic (piggyback) donor after
cardiac death (DCD) liver transplant, portal vein-portal vein
anastomosis, branch patch (recipient) to celiac patch (donor),
common bile duct to common bile duct anastomosis (no T tube)
with Dr [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please see the operative note for
surgical details. In addition it should be noted that this is a
DCD donor who also was HTLV1 and HTLV2 serologically
positive. Prior to surgery this was discussed in detail with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**]
in infectious disease and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 497**] in hepatology. It
was determined that the risk of continued progression of his
hepatocellular carcinoma and risk of complications and death
from his end-stage liver disease was greater than the risk of
transmission and the development of disease related to the HTLV1
and HTLV2 positivity. This was discussed with Mr. and Mrs.
[**Known lastname 64260**] in great detail and informed consent was given.
At the time of exploration the patient had approximately 12
liters of ascites that was cloudy and appeared chylous. It did
not smell or appear grossly infected. There was no fibrin in the
peritoneal cavity and no inflammation suggestive of peritonitis.
The fluid was sent for Gram stain which returned 1+ polys.
Cultures were sent which were returned as no growth.He was given
vancomycin and Zosyn in
addition to his preoperative Unasyn and in addition received
routine induction immunosuppression. He had a small cirrhotic
liver with normal anatomy. There was a tumor in theright lobe of
the liver, but no evidence of any extrahepatic spread. The donor
liver had a replaced left hepatic artery.
Patient was transferred to the SICU following surgery. He was
extubated on POD 2, and subsequently transferred the same day.
Seen by [**Last Name (un) **] for blood glucose management. He was managing
glucose at home prior to surgery with diet but will be
discharged home on Lantus and a humalog sliding scale. Patient
and wife received teaching and meds/syringes/supplies were
ordered.
On POD 6 the patient suffered a hypotensive episode with
tachycardia that appeared to be AFib on telemetry. He denied
chest pain, SOB or palpitations. He received a NS bolus for BP
of 80/P. Cardiology was consulted. Enzymes were cycled (normal,
metoprolol was continued. An Echo was performed showing an EF of
35%. In addition findings included comparison with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2155-4-16**], showing the regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction is new and c/w interim
ischemia/infarction (mid-LAD distribution). No anticoagulation
ws recommended, Metoprolol was increased to 25 [**Hospital1 **].
On POD 4 the medial drain started with more output and a drain
bili was sent with a result of 7.7. A CT was done showing no
drainable collections. After the patient fall he had an U/S of
the liver done to evaluate blood flow which was normal.
This output was followed for several days, and output was
replaced with albumin for each liter of output. When no relief
of drainage, patient was sent for an ERCP on [**12-17**] (POD 9)
Cholangiogram showed leak of contrast at the anastomotic site of
the [**Last Name (un) 28791**] and native bile duct and a 9cm by 10F Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **]
biliary stent was placed successfully across the anastomotic
leak site. Patient did have post ERCP pancreatitis, which was
treated with continued clears for an additional day. By POD 11
he was tolerating regular diet and the amylase and lipase
normalized.
On POD 12 (day of discharge) the final drain was removed and
suture placed.
He will go home with VNA for help with medications and blood
sugar management as this is a new therapy for him.
