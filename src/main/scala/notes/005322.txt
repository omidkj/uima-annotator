Brief Hospital Course:
Hypoxia: Multifactorial due to pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
Pneumonia caused by RSV, however ther is possibly a secondary
bacterial component. The patient completed a 5 day course of
Azithromycin as the imaging was also consistent with an atypical
bacteria. The Legionella antigen negative. He was gently
diuresed with Lasix IV and then restarted on his home dose. He
was euvolemic and satting well on room air at discharge.

Neuro:Pt with long standing Parkinson's disease; known
meningioma being monitored (no intervention). He was continued
on Amantadine, Sinemet, Tasmar, Mirapex.

CHF: Last echo in [**2195**], apparent exacerbation by exam, clinical
story, and CXR. Likely pt had mild volume overload which was
worsened by volume given in the ED and by lying flat during
central line placement. He did well with gentle lasix diuresis
as above. His lisinopril was continued. A new echo study to
evaluate for worsening EF showed worsening MR but it was not
changed from prior. For his hypercholesterolemia, he was
continued on lipitor.

For his depression, he was continued on zoloft and klonopin.

The patient's GERD was controlled on protonix here, although
he's on omeprazole at home. Prior to discharge, he was back to
baseline and had received both the pneumovax and the influenza
vaccine.
