Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath with progression over the past 3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
55M with CHF who is admitted from Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] clinic for
diuresis.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] has h/o AFIB, CAD s/p MI [**2132**] and CABG + MVR [**2140**],
re-do MVR [**2142**] and most recently in [**4-/2148**] underwent tricuspid
valvuloplasty + MVR + [**Hospital1 **]-atrial MAZE. Subsequently had worsening
fluid retention and admitted to cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] [**5-10**] for
exacerbation of congestive heart failure. Echo revealed normal
working bioprosthetic mitral valve and no TR. Was gently IV
diuresed with lasix gtt and discharged home after 6 day hospital
course. Subsequently underwent successful cardioversion on [**6-4**]
for his AF followed by a plasmapheresis for his high LDL [**6-5**].
Over the past week has noticed worsening leg edema, increased
abdominal girth and decreased exertional tolerance - short of
breath at twenty paces.  He increased lasix from 40 to 60 on [**6-3**]
then 60 to 80mg [**Hospital1 **] 4 days ago without improvement. He is
currently 217lb and says his dry weight is 205.

This morning felt especially weak and malaised, had trouble
sleeping at night. Saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in clinic who referred him to
the CCU for further treatment.

He denies any recent symptom of febrile/infectious illness.
Denies food indiscretion. He has been taking his medications w/o
fail. He denies recent chest pain.

He denies orthopnea, PND. Reports nocturia X1.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence syncope or
presyncope. See HPI otherwise.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2148-6-20**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2148-6-20**]):
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

STUDIES:
[**6-13**] EKG: Marked baseline artifact. Normal sinus rhythm
alternating with an atrial paced, ventricular sensed and atrial
paced, ventricular paced rhythm alternating with one hundred
percent ventricular paced rhythm. Frequent ventricular premature
beats and one ventricular couplet is noted. In the leads which
are comparable to tracing performed on [**2148-6-4**] there is no
diagnostic interval change. Several leads cannot be compared
because all the beats are paced.

[**6-14**] CXR: Current study demonstrates interval progression of
interstitial pulmonary edema currently moderate in severity
associated with small bilateral pleural effusions. Pacemaker
defibrillator leads are unchanged. Replaced valve, most likely
mitral appears to be in unchanged position. No pneumothorax is
seen.

[**6-15**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. LV systolic function
appears moderately-toseverely depressed (on milrinone), left
ventricular ejection fraction = 30%. However, the stroke volume
and cardiac index are preserved (due to the fact that the left
ventricle is dilated). The right ventricular free wall thickness
is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The gradients are higher than expected
for this type of prosthesis. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is
present. There is mild tricuspid stenosis due to the
annuloplasty ring. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
