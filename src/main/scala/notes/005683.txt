decending
artery had an ostial 80% stenosis and a mid 60% stenosis after
d1. D1

serial
stenosis up to 90% and extending into OM1. The right coronary
artery had
a long proximal 60% stenosis.
2) Left ventriculography revealed preserved normal left
ventricular
systolic function. Contrast calculated LVEF=55% There was no
evidence of
mitral regurgtation.

elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
