History of Present Illness:
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] is a 56-year-old
paraplegic woman who was admitted to an outside institution
on [**2176-3-28**] with respiratory insufficiency and
urosepsis. She appeared to have a right lower lobe pneumonia.
She was intubated for increasing respiratory distress. Three
days into her hospital stay she was noted to have worsening
ability to ventilate and was emergently treated with needle
decompression of her bilateral chests and removal of the
endotracheal tube changed to a new endotracheal tube.
Subsequent to this she was noted to have worsening
subcutaneous emphysema and bilateral air leaks on her chest
tubes. Bronchoscopy had been done which showed a soft tissue
mass bulging from the posterior tracheal wall from
approximately 4 cm below the cricoid to approximately 2-3 cm
above the carina. She was sent from the outside institution
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.


Past Medical History:
T4 sensory-motor paraplegia: s/p MVA in [**2143**], h/o spinal
surgery, suprapubic catheter (since [**2153**]), COPD, s/p multiple
foot surgeries, h/o hypercalcemia with bladder stones, s/p
interscalene block with L shoulder arthroscopy and subacromial
decompression in [**2167**], h/o heel cellulitis, neurogenic bladder
with vesicoureteral reflux

Physical Exam:
general: intubated sedated female.
HEENT; intubated
chest: bilateral chest tubes to sxn
cor: RRR, S1, S2
abd: soft, NT, ND, +BS
extrem: lower extrem flaccid
neuro: sedated, paraplegia

Pertinent Results:
[**2176-4-17**]: PORTABLE CHEST: Compared to [**2176-4-14**], a right-sided
chest tube has been removed, and there is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Right central venous catheter and tracheostomy
tube are unchanged in position. A Dobbhoff tube is seen coursing
below the diaphragm with its tip terminating to the right of the
spine likely within the pylorus.

A small right pleural effusion persists. Left lower lobe
atelectasis persists. Lungs otherwise appear unchanged compared
to three days prior.

IMPRESSION:
1. Appropriate positioning of Dobbhoff tube.

2. Status post removal of right chest tube with no evidence of
pneumothorax.

intercostal muscle flap, pleural flap buttress, central line
placement.
post operatively, pt remained intubated and was re-admitted to
the CRSU for ongoing ventilatory and hemodynamic support. She
required paralysis and sedation to achieve adeq ventilatory
support, and pressors for hemodynamic stabilty.
She had a left chest tube, and 3 right chest tubes all to sxn.

On [**4-12**]/ she was taken to the OR for a trial extubation in a
controlled setting in case of need for sugical airway. She was
tacypneic w/ small tidal volumes and therefore a trach was
performed. She has a #7 portex.  She has presently weaned from
the vent and is [**Last Name (un) 1815**] trach mask. A dobhoff tube was placed [**4-13**]
