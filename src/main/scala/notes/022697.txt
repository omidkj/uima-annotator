VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW: Study is performed in conjunction
with speech and swallow therapy. Various consistencies of barium
were administered orally. The patient demonstrated a moderate to
large amount of aspiration with both thin and nectar thick
liquids. There was an effective but inconsistent spontaneous
cough response. The aspiration occurred during and following
swallowing. There is premature spillage of liquids to the level
of the valleculae. There is minimally diminished laryngeal
elevation and there is normal epiglottic deflection. There is a
small to moderate amount of residue within the piriform sinuses.
There is a suggestion of narrowing in the region of the
pharyngeal esophageal junction, which was difficult to evaluate
due to patient positioning.

IMPRESSION:
1) Aspiration of liquid consistencies with effective but
inconsistent spontaneous cough response.
2) Possible narrowing in the region of the pharyngoesophageal
junction. This was difficult to evaluate due to patient
positioning. If direct visualization is not being considered,
than AP and lateral soft tissue radiographs of the neck could be
performed for further evaluation.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: RESPIRATORY DISTRESS

Portable chest film shows the lungs to be clear without evidence
of pulmonary edema. Post surgical changes with mediastinal wires
and clips.

CONCLUSION: Clear lungs. No evidence for pulmonary edema.
