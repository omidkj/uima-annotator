History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10653**] is a 64 y/o male who recently presented to his PCP
last week [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/o progressive DOE. He was subsequently scheduled for
an ETT. The patient exercised for 4 minutes stopping d/t fatigue
and chest tightness. EKG exhibited ST elevation inferiorly and
Nuclear MIBI showed lateral wall defect. Patient was then
tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath and further management.
Cath revealed significant three vessel disease and patient was
referred for surgical management.

Pertinent Results:
CT [**1-7**]: 1. No evidence of aortic dilatation. 2. 3-mm
noncalcified pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe. Please
follow in one year if this patient has no history of malignancy.
3. Right renal cyst. 4. Focal calcification in the segment VIII
of the liver. 5. Coronary artery calcification.
[**1-13**]: Although lung volumes have improved since [**1-10**],
left lower lobe collapse has not cleared. Small bilateral
pleural effusions remain. Postoperative widening of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette improved between [**1-10**] and 13
and is subsequently unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or
pulmonary edema.
Cath [**1-6**]: Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system revealed three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA
had distal 20% stenosis with moderate calcification. The LAD had
calcified 80% mid segments stenosis and mid-distal 60% stenosis.
The LCX had diffuse disease with 40% stenosis in the AV groove.
The OM1 had 90% proximal stenosis. The ramus intermedius was
patent. The RCA had proximal 95% stenosis with TIMI 2 flow. Left
ventriculography revealed trace mitral regurgitation. There was
evidence of mild inferior and posterobasal hypokinesis.
Calculated ejection fraction was 70%.
Echo [**1-12**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small
circumferential partially echofilled pericardial effusion. No
definite right atrial collapse is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, patient underwent cardiac cath which
revealed 3 vessel disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted.
Patient underwent usual pre-operative work-up. Along with a
Chest CT to r/o Aorta dilatation (please see pertinent results).
UA appeared to be positive for UTI and he was started on
Levaquin. He was eventually cleared and consented for surgery
and on [**2201-1-9**] was brought to the operating room where he
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please see op not
for surgical details. Following surgery patient was transferred
to the CSRU in stable condition. Later on op day sedation was
weaned and patient awoke neurologically intact. He was then
extubated. B-Blockers, Aspirin, and Diuretics were initiated per
protocol. He was gently diuresed during hospital course towards
pre-operative weight. On post-op day one his chest tubes were
removed and he was transferred to the cardiac surgery step-down
unit. Post-op day two his epicardial pacing wires were removed.
Physical therapy began working with patient post-operatively for
strength and mobility. On post-op day three patient heart rhythm
converted to rapid Atrial fibrillation/flutter. Lopressor and
Amiodarone were given. Patient became hypotensive along with
decrease in oxygen saturation. He was then transferred back to
the CSRU for closer management. He eventually converted back to
SR and appeared stable. He was started on coumadin and then
transferred back to the step-down unit.

 He stayed on the floor for observation/management of INR. He
will go home with foley in place and is to follow up with his
urologist on Monday [**1-19**]. His WBC count increased to 16.2 and he
was held for additional labs and an increased INR of 3.2. Foley
was ultimately removed and INR moved to therapeutic range and
WBC normalized. Discharged to home with VNA on POD #10. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1637**] follow coumadin/INR. Blood draw scheduled for Tues.
[**1-20**].
