and then received a call from his HHA at approximately 12pm

close post-procedure monitoring.

Past Medical History:
1) chronic atrial fibrillation
2) CAD - s/p cath in [**2178**] which revealed LAD occlusion, good
collateral flow.
3) pleural pericarditis - Pleural effusion since [**2178**]. In [**2178**],
the patient underwent a procedure to examine the pleural fluid
as well as a lung biopsy, both of which did not reveal a clear
etiology to the source of the patient's effusion. The patient at

a
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname 101490**] was diagnosed with an embolic stroke of the MCA
territory, his NIH stroke scale was calculated at 12 - he had a
dense RIGHT facial weakness in an UMN distribution and he was
essentially mute; he had little observed focal weakness of his
extremities at this time. He receieved IV t-PA at 0.9mg/kg and
was transferred to the Neuro-ICU for close monitoring. He
remained hemodynamically stable there overnight with noticeable
improvement in his speech. His verbal output greatly increased
although his speech remains quite dysarthric. He was ruled out
for MI.
Neurologically, Dr. [**Known lastname 101490**] has remained stable with dense RIGHT
lower facial paresis and dysarthria. He also was noted to have a
fairly weak gag reflex. He failed his speech and swallow
evaluation. An NGT was placed for nutritional purposes. Dr.
[**Known lastname 101490**] has been reticent with PT. Because  of his atrial
fibrillation, he has reluctantly agreed to begin warfarin which
was started [**2185-10-10**] PM at 5mg QHS.

The patient has remained hemodynamically stable. He has had some
evidence of fluid retention with intermitent bibasilar crackles
and lower extremity edema. He has required several boluses of IV
furosemide to improve his urine output. His oxygen requirement
has been 2L NC to mainatin Pox>95%. CXRs have revealed a stable
chronic RIGHT pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and some discoid
atelectasis. He has chronic atrial fibrillation and had episodes
of recorded tachycardia likely secondary to irregular rate.

At admission, Dr. [**Known lastname 101490**] had an indwelling Foley catheter
because of chronic urinary retention likely secondary to BPH. A
urinalysis revealed >50 WBCs. Ciprofloxacin was started. The
patient has completed [**3-3**] day course. Results of UCx are still
pending.

With regard to nutrition, Dr. [**Known lastname 101490**] failed a speech and swallow
evaluation with solids and liquids. He was started on tube
feeding [**2185-10-10**] with Promote w/fiber. Nutrition was consulted.
