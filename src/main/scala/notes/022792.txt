History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91333**] is a 60yo female with pmhx of T2DM complicated by
nephropathy (ESRD on HD), retinopathy, neuropathy and peripheral
vascular disease, CAD, CHF, presented from her rehab with
lethargy and hypoglycemia. The patient was scheduled for her HD
today, and her vital signs in the AM were normal, although she
was felt to be lethargic at her nursing home. In the ambulance
on the way to HD, the patient's BG was 60, which improved to 110
after oral sugar. She was then brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
evaluation rather than going to HD. Of note, the patient has
chronic pruritis for which she is followed by a dermatologist,
she has many excoriations.

The patient's [**Hospital1 **] glucose was 60 on admission in the ED. This
improved to 106 after a glass of OJ, which also improved her
mental status. She was A&Ox1 at time of initial evaluation in
the ED. FSGS 66 -> [x]oral OJ -> repeat 68 -> []oral OJ.

In the ED, initial VS were: 103.5 101 113/50 16 100% at 1500.
She then had a desaturation recorded at 87% at 1600, which
improved to 100%. Her [**Hospital1 **] pressure was >100 systolic until
around 1900, at which point she decrease to 90 systolic and was
maintained around there until 2100. Her fever curve trended down
so that she was afebrile at the time of leaving the ED at 22:28.
O2 sat for the remainder of stay in the ED. 18g was placed at
the wrist. [**Hospital1 **] BP per her nursing home is 90-100 systolic.

The patient received 2L NS, Cefepime, Flagyl, Daptomycin and
Tylenol. A CXR revealed pulmonary congestion.

Her abdomen was distended so a bladder pressure was obtained,
which was 18mmHg.  A CT abdomen was obtained, which revealed no
acute pathology.

Nephrology was consulted in the ED, but no note was left.
Lactate was 1.5. Per ED report, they evaluated the patient.

She was admitted to the MICU for concern for urosepsis due to
her [**Hospital1 **] pressures, which is [**Hospital1 5348**] per her nursing home,
hypoglycemia.

On arrival to the MICU, the patinet was alert and oriented x3,
except not to the date but to the month and year. She reported
that she had been having periods of "black outs" where she
doesn't recall details over the past 3 months. She says that
that happened this morning when she does not know what happened,
but the next thing she knew, she was at [**Hospital1 18**].

Of note, the patient has recently had the following discontinued
or changed: Lantus 24U qhs increased to 26U; gabapentin
increased from 300mg after HD to 400mg QID; ativan 0.5mg q8h PRN
anxiety was d/c'd; buproprion was d/c'd, venlafaxine d/c'd.
