Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, hypercapnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation


History of Present Illness:
68M with history of COPD (on 2-3L O2 at home) with history of
multiple intubations, CAD with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
20-25%) who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an outside hospital on
[**2170-3-22**] with SOB.  Pt initially noted fever to 102, 4 days prior
to admission.  However patient was without respiratory
complaints or cough.  Pt was started on course of Azithromycin
as an outpatient for suspected bronchitis and reports some
improvement in pulm Sx. The evening prior to admisssion, the
patient became progressively dyspnic with a minimally-productive
cough.

Pt presented to an outside hospital where he was found to have
HR 150 that was believed to be possible Aflutter but, per
report, was found to be sinus tachcardia.  CXR, per report, was
consistent with mild CHF and possible RML PNA. ABG on 100% NRB
was 7.25/61/77.  Further treamtent at outside hospital included
ASA 325, NTG SL times 2, Alb/Atr nebs, Lasix 60 mg IV,
Sloumedrol 125mg IV, Ceftriaxone and Moxifloxacin.  Pt was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On arrival to MICU [**2170-3-22**] pt felt "much better" and was
without chest pain, palpitations, N/V, abd pain,
dysuria/frequency. He was transferred to the floor, however he
subequently developed SOB and diaphoresis. He developed
increased respiratory distress, ABG's revealed (pH 7.33/44/70
lactate 4.9->7.22/66/130 @ 11am->7.3/59/145. Pt was again
brought to the MICU and intubated for this resp distress.

Past Medical History:
COPD (2-3L home O2, intubated 3 times for exacerbations)
CAD s/p MI [**2165**] and stent (unclear anatomy/location of stent)
Cardiomyopathy, ischemic (EF 20-25%)
Hypercholesterolemia
HTN
Chronic kidney disease baseline cr 1.8
Periph vascular disease
CVA, multiple with residual R>L weakness, aphasia

Social History:
h/o heavy tob use quit [**2159**] as well as prior EtOH abuse, no
illicit drug use.  Pt lives with his wife and is able to
ambulate with walker at baseline.

Pertinent Results:
1. CXR at admission: Emphysema. Right lower lobe patchy opacity
concerning for pneumonia. Left basilar patchy opacity may
represent atelectasis or infection as well.

2. CXR ([**3-23**]): worsening pneumonia w/underlying emphysema

3. CXR ([**3-31**]): bilat pleural effusions, improved RLL opacity,
probable mild CHF.

4. ECHO ([**3-23**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include inferior, inferoseptal and inferolateral and apical
akinesis with a small apical aneurysm present. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

5. Lab data:
- Microbiology: blood and urine Cx with no growth. Sputum with
no microorg seen. Influenza DFA negative.
- proBNP ([**4-1**]): 12,009 (range 0-229, levels >1000 have 78% PPD)
- peak CK 390 on [**3-23**]
- TropT 2.86 ([**4-2**])
- creatinine 1.3 (at admission) -> 1.6 ([**3-25**]) -> 0.9-1.0

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo man with h/o COPD, CAD, cardiomyopathy with depressed EF
who presented with SOB and hypercapnia in setting of COPD
exacerbation s/p intubation and MICU for resp failure c/b NSVT.


ICU course significant for:

1) Pulm: Resp Failure [**2-7**] COPD exacerbation.  Self-extubated ICU
D#2, reintubated ICU D#3 for resp failure.  COPD treated with
slow steroid taper, nebs. Extubated again ICU D#5 complicated by
resp. distress requiring NRB -> BiPAP and received Lasix 40mg
IV.

2) CVS: During initial ICU presentation, was hypotensive
requiring pressor support (weaned off over first 2 days).
During MICU course, suffering from runs of NSVT.  With
tachycardia, evidence of demand ischemia by CE's and ECG.
Tachycardia with ectopy, likely secondary to respiratory
distress; responded to B-B.  Cardiology felt likely has new
coronary lesion and recommended cath given h/o 3VD. Pt was
initially to be transferred to [**Hospital1 2025**] for cath (Accepting
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2643**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2644**]) or Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 2645**],
interventionalist), however, he decided he did not want an
intervention and was d/c'ed home. Heparin not initiated. Medical
management was maximized.

3) ID: RLL PNA treated with 10 day course of CTX (finished
[**2170-4-2**]).

4) Hypotension: BP dropped after intubation. Best guess of
sequence of events is mucous plug leading to hypoxemia that
caused inadequate oxygen supply to the myocardium causing
transient myocardial ischemic; CK, CK-MB, and troponin rising on
transfer to MICU. This may have led to transient cardiac failure
(quasi-cardiogenic shock). BP initially maintained on Levophed

Hospital course by problems:

1) COPD exacerbation in setting of PNA. Pt with acute
respiratory decompensation requiring intubation on [**3-23**] thought
to be secondary to mucous plug. Respiratory status returned to
baseline prior to discharge.
- He was treated with a slow steroid taper, tiotropium, Advair,
Singulair, and Alb prn

2) CHF: Pt with h/o Cardiomyopathy and EF 30%. He was euvolemic
without evidence of decompensated CHF at time of discharge. I/O
goal of even to slightly negative was maintained on Lasix 40 mg
[**Hospital1 **] (home regimen 80 [**Hospital1 **]). He was continued on an ACEi for
afterload reduction. His heart rate was well controlled on Metop
25 [**Hospital1 **].

3) CAD: 3VD s/p MI [**2165**] and stent. Elevated Trop-t likely [**2-7**]
demand ischemia in setting of tachycardia (sinus tach with
ectopy thought to be [**2-7**] to resp distress). ECG with ST
depression lat. Cardiac enzymes trending down at time of
discharge. Cardiology feels there may be a new lesion and given
h/o 3VD and would prefer cath, however pt declines. He
understands risks and benefits  He was continued on ASA, Lipitor
(80mg), B-B, ACEi (lisinopril 5 mg). He had no subsequent events
on tele.

4) NSVT:  Pt with intermittent runs of NSVT during MICU stay
likely secondary to demand ischemia and lung disease. [**Month (only) 116**]
benefit from ICD placement. Will defer to pt's outpt
cardiologist. Rate well controlled on Metop 25 [**Hospital1 **].

5) RLL PNA. Received 10 day course of CTX (ended on [**2170-4-2**]).

6) CRF. Baseline Cr thought to be 1.8, however Creat improved to
0.
