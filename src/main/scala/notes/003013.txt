Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, unresponsivness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 yo M with h/o anoxic brain injury s/p cardiac
arrest [**2149**], PAF, DM 2, and HTN who presents with fever and
intermittent unresponsivness. Per NH notes, pt became
unresponsive at 7:45 am while perfomring ADLs. Pt afebrile at
the time with BP 150/83, HR 90, O2 sat 95% on RA, FS 471. He was
given 10 units of lispro and became more responsive around 8:15
am. The pt also received 6 units of lispro at noon and had KUB
checked given complaints of abdominal pain that revealed a
distended bladder. He again had an episode of unresponsiveness
at 1:30pm after lunch. At that time, he had a temperature of
100.0, HR 62, BP 180/100, RR 20, and O2 sat 93% on RA. At this
point, he was transported to the ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, T 104.2 rectally, BP 194/112, HR 170, RR 24, O2 sat
91% RA. EKG revealed afib with RVR with slight ST depressions in
the lateral leads. He was given 1 L of NS with improvement in
his HR to 94. Foley placed with 1.5 L of urine drained. Port CXR
without definitive evidence of consolidations, UA negative, CT
abd/pelvis without acute inflammatory processes. Labs
significant for WBC 13.9, Na 159, Cr 1.9, trop 0.79, CK 227,
lactate 2.7. Given vancomycin 1 gm IV X 1, levoquin 500 mg IV X
1, flagyl 500 mg IV X 1, tylenol 1 gm PR, ASA 325 mg po X 1,
metoprolol 50 mg po X 1, and a total of 3L NS and 1 L D5W with
HCO3. Cardiology was consulted who felt that ACS was unlikely.
As SBPs remained elevated > 180, he was started on a nitro gtt
and admitted to the MICU for further care.
.
The pt cannot say why he was taken to the hospital and does not
recall any precipitating factors of his episodes of
unresponsiveness earlier today. He does report a new cough with
sputum. On ROS, otherwise denies fevers, chills, headache, stiff
neck, chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, and
urinary frequency. No rashes. Per pt's daugther, pt has been
intermittently complaining of lower abdominal pain and had an
episode of emesis last Friday. He apparently was also
complaining of a headache in the ED, which the pt denies.


Past Medical History:
1. DM2
2. Hypertension
3. Hyperlipidemia
4. h/o VFIB arrest in [**12-18**] secondary to cocaine/EtOH use,
complicated by coma, anoxic brain injury, and evidence if IMI,
inferior ischemia with resultant improvement in heart function
5. Paroxysmal AFib: not on anticoagulation due to fall risk
6. Anoxic Brain Injury/Dementia
7. Pulmonary Hypertension
8. BPH with urinary retention
9. GERD


Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital3 537**] after cardiac arrest and anoxic brain
injury. Is ambulatory though with memory delay. Legal guardian
is daughter [**Name (NI) 7346**] [**Name (NI) 3924**] who is a nurse. Past h/o cocaine, EtOH
use. NO IVDA.

Pertinent Results:
IMPRESSION: No acute intra-abdominal pathology identified

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo M with h/o cardiac arrest with anoxic brain injury, PAF,
HTN, and DM 2 who presents with fever, intermittent
unresponsiveness, and elevated cardiac enzymes.
.

# Atrial fibrillation/ elevated troponin

On arrival to MICU service, treated AF with RVR with lopressor
5mg IV x 2. Patient reverted to NSR without recurrence of AF.
Nitro gtt was quickly weaned off, and BP stabilized with BPs
130s/70s. Covered broadly with vanc/ceftaz/azithro, with no
fevers overnight. Satting 98% RA with no complaints. Much more
alert, eating well. Cardiology evaluated patient and believes
elevated cardiac enzymes likely due to demand ischemia from RVR.
.

# Aspiration pneumonia

Likely aspiration event in setting unresponsiveness. Cover with
levofloxacin for 7 days. Urine culture no growth, blood cultures
with no growth thus far. Ambulatory saturations were above 94%.
.

# Urinary retention

Failed 2 voiding trials. Likely related to medications,
currently not on any medications which would exacerbate the
problem. [**Name (NI) **] has follow up scheduled with Urology on [**2151-7-5**] with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

# Diabetes

Placed back on metformin and glipizide. Needs adjustment as
indicated. HgBA1c was pending at the time of discharge.
.

# Altered mental status

Poor baseline given anoxic brain injury due to ventricular
fibrillatiobn arrest. This acute change was likely related to
hypertensive encephalopathy and severe hypernatremia. He was
back to baseline per HCP which is the daughter. [**Name (NI) **] has short
term memory problems but is easily re-oriented.
.

# Acute renal failure

Resolved with IVF and back to baseline.
.

# Communication

Daughter and HCP is [**Name (NI) 7346**] [**Name (NI) 3924**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 19907**]
