LABORATORY DATA:  White count 4.0, 83 percent neutrophils,
hematocrit 24.9.  PT 13.9, INR 1.3.  Sodium 141, potassium
3.6, chloride 111, bicarb 23, BUN 24, creatinine 0.9, glucose
79.  Calcium 7.9, phos 3.1, mag 1.6.  TSH 17, free T4 1.0.
CK 129, CKMB 6, troponin 0.02.  LFTs from [**9-5**] include ALT

44, t-bili 0.7.  Urine culture no growth.  Chest x-ray new
left basilar opacity, infiltrate versus atelectasis versus
effusion.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed congestive
gastropathy with fundal varices.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GI bleed.  The patient may have been bleeding secondary
to fundal varices with a history of AVM, now portal
hypertension gastropathy.  Patient was continued on Protonix
p.o. b.i.d.  Hematocrit was checked every eight hours.
Hematocrit on day of discharge was 31.  Patient's diet was
advanced to clears and eventually a regular heart healthy
diet on the day of discharge.  Patient's appetite was good by
the day of discharge.  Will restart iron supplements upon
discharge.

2.  Hepatitis C with EGD consistent with portal
hypertension/cirrhosis.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound was
performed on the day of discharge, [**9-7**], the report is
pending.  Patient is to follow up in liver clinic for the
results of this ultrasound.  Hepatitis C viral load in [**2176-9-11**] was 74,700.  Consider recheck of viral load as an
outpatient.  Consider liver biopsy as outpatient workup.
Patient was started on low dose nadolol 20 mg q.day.  This
dose was increased to 40 mg q.day on the day of discharge to
decrease portal pressure.  This medication also helps
patient's overall blood pressure as well.

3.  High TSH.  The patient is currently on levothyroxine 125
mcg q.d.  Although the patient's TSH was elevated, patient
had a normal free T4 level.  Consider further workup as an
outpatient.

4.  High blood pressure.  The patient's blood pressure
tolerated nadolol prescribed for portal hypertension.
Patient was restarted on Avapro.  We discontinued Cardizem as
this medication is no longer needed with the initiation of
nadolol.

5.  Osteoporosis.  The patient was given her usual outpatient
calcium and vitamin D.

6.  Nonproductive cough.  Most likely resolving bronchitis,
treated with Tessalon Perles.

7.  Prophylaxis.  Pneumo-boots, proton pump inhibitor and
patient was ambulating.

8.  Code status.  DNR, however, not DNI.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
