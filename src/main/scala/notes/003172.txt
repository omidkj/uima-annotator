History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35028**] is an 80 year old man with a history of CAD s/p MI
in [**2181**] and CABG in [**2182**], CHF with EF of 55% in [**11-10**], A. fib on
warfarin, and 2 recent admissions for a right retroperitoneal
abscess and right empyema which grew Pantoea spp (an
Enterobacter-like bacteria) which was resistent to cefazolin and
ampicillin, but sensitive to fluoroquinolones. He was treated
with levofloxacin from [**11-2**] to [**2188-11-8**] for a 7 day course.
Pigtail drains were placed in the retroperitoneal abscess and
VATS was performed to debride the empyema. Warfarin was held to
prevent bleeding. He was discharged to rehab on [**2188-11-17**] but
readmitted on [**2188-11-21**] for subsegmental PE. Cultures from the
residual pleural effusion and retroperitoneal mass were negative
at that time. He was anticoagulated once again with Lovenox as a
bridge to warfarin. That hospitalization was complicated by
delirium and foley trauma. He was discharged to rehab and then
home with VNA.
.
Today VNA found the Found to have spO2 69-80% on RA. He
complained of SOB, PND, and DOE. EMS was called and he was
brought to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital. There, spO2 was 99% on 3L. A CXR
showed the known RLL effusion as well as a possible new
infiltrate in lingula. BNP was 1100, TnT was 0.17, and INR 2.5.
Given the possible PNA, he was treated with azithromycin 500mg
plus ceftriaxone 1g IV for CAP and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation by Thoracic Surgery here.
.
On arrival to ED the patient was somnolent but easily arousable
with verbal or physical stimuli. He denied and SOB or CP. Given
his ongoing somnolence, an ABG was done which showed significant
hypercarbia (pH 7.29 pCO2 94 pO2 81 O2Sat 95%). He was placed on
BiPAP but his mental status worsened and he became unresponsive.
He was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
Given his history of PE, a CTA was done which showed no PE and
stable to improved RLL infiltrates. A CT of the head showed no
bleed or process to explain his respiratory failure. No cultures
were taken but the patient was treated empirically for HAP with
vancomycin 1g IV x 1 on top of the ceftriaxone plus azithromycin
received at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80 year-old man with s/p recent VATS and drainagae of
an empyema and retroperitoneal abscess infected with Pantoea spp
(an Enterobacter-like bacteria) and PE on warfarin as well as
CAD s/p CABG, CHF, and Afib, admitted with hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The etiology of the patient's
respiratory failure is thought to be multifactorial, with likely
aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of the patient's
underlying lung abnormalities (right pleural effusion, PE,
retroperitoneal abscess) and hypothyroidism (TSH 35) all
contributing. Although the patient's respiratory failure was
initially though to be infectious in origin, and he was treated
with Vancomycin  Flagyl and Levofloxacin for aspiration
pneumonia (given his history of aspiration--see speech and
swallow notes--as well as his recent history of hospitalization,
rehab and empyema + retroperitoneal abscess growing Pantoea
spp), antibiotics were discontinued after 2 days when the
patient failed to spike a fever, become hypoxic or develop any
significant leukocytosis or infiltrate on chest xray. He was
intubated and mechanically ventilated for one day, and was
extubated without difficulty. Although the OSH was concerned
about CHF, the patient did not become hypoxic at any point and
had no crackles on exam or evidence of CHF on xray.  Based on
the patient's ABGs, he seems to be somewhat of a chronic
retainer (possibly due to pulmonary physiology s/p effusions and
empyema and abscess and surgeries) and his pCO2 settled out at
approximately 54.  After transfer to the floor he never required
supplemental oxygen, worked easily with physical therapy and had
a rather uncomplicated hospital course.
.
# Aspiration - The patient was evaluated by video swallow, which
showed aspiration with straw sips of thin liquids; penetration
with cup sips of thin liquids.  Speech and swallow therapy
recommended: 1. PO diet: regular solids, nectar thick liquids
during meals; 2. Between meals, pt may have single sips of
water, coffee, and
ensure shakes 3. TID oral care; 4. Assist with meals as needed
to maintain aspiration precautions, including:
   a) sit fully upright for all PO
   b) swallow twice per bite/twice per sip
   c) no guzzling - single sips only
5. Repeat videoswallow study in [**1-4**] weeks either as an
outpatient.
.
# Pulmonary embolus: The patient was diagnosed [**2188-11-22**] with
Segmental pulmonary embolism within the anterior basal segment
of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery. Warfarin as an
outpatient.
