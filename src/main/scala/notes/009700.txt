Brief Hospital Course:
1. Neuro: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was periodically agitated, requiring
significant amounts of sedation. By the time of discharge, Mr.
[**Known lastname 62569**] agitation status was much improved.
2. Cardiovascular: Mr. [**Known lastname **] remained relatively hemodynamically
stable.  He did have intermittent bouts of atrial
fibrillation/flutter that required a Diltiazem drip. He was
successfully transition to PO Diltiazem and Lopressor, and near
the time of discharge, Lisinopril.

3. Respiratory: Initially, there was a question of ARDS vs.
pneumonia, and had a PEEP requirement as high as 22. On [**11-4**] and
[**11-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a bronchoscopy and BAL, with sputum
cultures growing Pseudomonas.  His pneumonia was covered by
Ciprofloxacin and Zosyn (for pseudomonal double-coverage).  He
was slow to wean from his vent, however, soon only had PEEP and
PS requirements of 5 and 5. On [**11-21**] he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a bedside
tracheostomy, which he tolerated well.  Soon thereafter, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] was able to tolerate a trach collar.

4. GI: He came to [**Hospital1 18**] on TPN until [**11-9**].  On [**11-5**] a DHT was
placed and tube feeds were gradually advanced to goal.  On [**11-29**]
he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a video swallow evaluation in which he had some
initial aspiration.  Speech and swallow recommendations were for
thin liquids and ground solids, which he tolerated well.  On
[**12-1**], he [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a repeat CT scan that showed that only the
head of the uncinate process of the pancreas was viable, but
otherwise improved. Speech and nutrition recommend that the
patient have re-evaluation with a video swallow to determine if
he can tolerate regular texture.

5. GU: He was placed on a Lasix drip to help achieve diuresis.
By [**11-26**] his Lasix requirement was down to Lasix 20 mg PO BID
and he was euvolemic.  The diuresis was stopped on [**12-1**].

6. ID: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was placed on Imipenem for empiric coverage of
necrotizing pancreatitis, which was stopped on [**10-31**].  Mr. [**Known lastname **]
had a high-grade MRSA bacteremia from CVL sepsis, with last
positive blood cultures on [**9-23**].  He suffered from
Pseudomonas VAP, with a [**11-4**] BAL/sputum grew pseudomonas and
MRSA, respectively.  He was treated with Vanc/Zosyn/and Cipro.
A [**11-14**] TEE was negative for vegetations.  He received a 2-week
course of Vancomycin for MRSA coverage and a 3-week course of
Zosyn and Cipro for pseudomonal coverage.  While on
broad-spectrum antibiotics, he was also placed empirically on
Fluconazole, which was completed on [**11-28**].  His WBC count
continued to decline and he became afebrile.  His progress was
facilitated by the Infectious Disease team. The patient is
currently on no antibiotics.

7. Endocrine: Blood sugar control was aggressively managed with
an insulin drip and sliding scale as needed. The patient's
sugars have been well controlled with sliding scale.
