increased to 15,000, and while he had no abdominal tenderness,
he continued to pass blood-tinged stool. Surgical consultation
was obtained on [**2165-12-20**]. We performed a rigid
sigmoidoscopy at the bedside and demonstrated significant
mucosal ischemia. We were unable to tell if this was
full-thickness. On physical examination, he had some left lower
quadrant tenderness. Exploratory laparotomy performed with no
evidence of intra-abdominal pathology.
 Abdominal ultrasound  showed patent hepatic vasculature. 2.5-cm
conglomerate of cysts in L medial lobe of the liver. 2-cm cyst
at the interpolar region of the R kidney. Gallstones and sludge.
There is a small focal area of gallbladder wall thickening.
LFT's elevated. Transplant surgery consulted.

[**2165-12-22**]: RML atelectasis on CXR-bronchoscopy performed by
general surgery at beside,  showing multiple large mucoid plugs.
Lesser plugging of RUL. Good clearance with saline lavage.
Minimal airway erythema. No Complications during procedure.
Follow up CXR showed slight improved expansion.

[**2165-12-23**]: LFT's beginning to trend down. Bronchoscopy repeated,
to evaluate infiltrate on CXR. Sputum spec sent for culture.
 Results: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2165-12-23**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS AND CLUSTERS.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S).
Procedure done without complication. Vent weaning started today,
TPN ordered. Continued diuresis for TBB -2L.

[**2165-12-24**]: Repeat bedside flexible sigmoidoscopy showed no
evidence of ongoing mucosal ischemia.

[**2165-12-25**]: CTA of chest negative for PE, revealed B/L pleural
effusions, with mild airspace disease. RLL reexpanded. Abdominal
US unchanged from [**12-20**].

[**2165-12-26**]: All LFT's down, transplant service continuing to
monitor. Vent weaning and diuresis continued.

[**2165-12-29**]: Extubated. Tube feeds held. TPN continued.
