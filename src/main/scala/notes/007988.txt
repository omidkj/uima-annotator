Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year old male with a history of prostate
cancer with bony metastases, atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
[**First Name3 (LF) 18048**] s/p renal transplant, lung cancer s/p resection and h/o
prior GIB (per patient) who presented to the ED on [**2129-5-29**] after
having large volume brown, guaiac positive emesis at his [**Hospital1 1501**] the
morning of presentation. The patient states that he has vomited
4-5 times on the day of admission. He denied any hemetemesis,
hematochezia, or melena although he cannot recall what color his
stool is. He admitted to having had "coffee ground" emesis prior
to this admission. The patient denied any abdominal pain,
lightheadedness or dizziness.

He did admit to a cough with brownish sputum for the "past hour"
prior to admission but denied any shortness of breath or chest
pain. He denied any orthopnea or back pain.

In the ED, the patient was found to have a fever of 103.8 with a
SBP of 75/53 with a HR in the 140-160s. He was given 5 liters of
NS in the ED with SBP 102/50 and a drop in his HR to 110-130. He
was found to have a Hct of 24.8 with a WBC of 7.7 and no bands.
He also had an INR of 3.3 on coumadin for afib. The patient was
found to be guaiac positive rectally. Therefore, the patient was
transfused 2 units PRBC in the ED. His CXR showed a bibasilar
opacities concerning for pneumonia. The patient was started on
decadron 6 mg IV for presumed sepsis, CTX/flagyl/vanco which was
switched to zosyn/vanco and bibasilar pneumonia with a lactate
of 3.2. Two peripheral IVs were placed and he was transferred to
the MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:
In the MICU, the pt's hematocrit remained stable after the 2
units of PRBCs given in the ED.  The gastroenterology service
was consulted for EGD and colonoscopy which are planned.  He was
kept NPO.  His hypotension was felt to be secondary to
hypovolemia and his blood pressure responded to IVF
resuscitation.  His lopressor and cardizem were held.  He was
also placed on stress-dose steroids.  The patient presented with
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate to the 140-160s
which responded well to IVF to the 100s. It was felt that his
rapid rate was either precipitated by his hypotension or the
cause of it.  The patient was on digoxin 0.125 mg daliy for rate
control. He was taking coumadin as an outpatient with a
supratherapeutic INR of 3.3. His coumadin is currently being
held and he was given 10 mg SC of vitamin K in the ED. Despite
this, his INR was 4.1 on the morning of transfer. He was found
to have a bibasilar pneumonia and was started on on Zosyn and
Vancomycin (1st dose 5-15).  Blood cultures were obtained on
[**5-29**] and are pending.

The following issues were addressed after transfer to the floor:

1. UGIB/Hematemesis: The pts hematocrit was cycled q12 hours and
was stable in the 27-29 range, requiring no further
transfusions.  An EGD was performed on hospital day three.  It
revealed an arteriovenous malformation in the gastric antrum
which was cauterized.  He was maintained on an intravenous PPI.
He did have an episode of BRBPR and a small blood clot in his
stool on hospital day 4.  His hematocrit remained stable but he
received one unit of PRBCs on hospital day six to support his
volume.

2. Bibasilar pneumonia: As part of the pt's overall workup a CT
scan of the torso was performed on hospital day 3.  This
revealed, amongst other findings, a near total collapse of the
right lung.  The pulmonary service was consulted and performed a
bronchoscopy on hospital day five.  They noted that the right
lung had re-inflated.  They took bronchial biopsies of
irregularly-appearing mucosa.  The pt. did spike fevers on the
antibiotics.  Once the pt. was made CMO, antibiotics were
discontinued.

3. Atrial fibrillation:  The patient was placed on digoxin 0.125
mg for rate control as cardizem and lopressor held secondary to
hypotension on admission.  His anticoagulation with warfarin was
discontinued.  He developed RVR with heart rates into the 180's.
 Metoprolol was started at a low dose and slowly titrated up
with effect.  The pt. did require intravenous pushes of
metoprolol and diltiazem on hospital days three, four and five
for RVR into the 180's.  After these interventions, his heart
rate would decrease and remain relatively stable into the
90-100's for the next 24 hours.  Even after the pt. was made
CMO, oral metoprolol was continued to help control palpitations.


4. [**Month/Year (2) 18048**] s/p renal transplant
The pt. was transferred to the floor on azathioprine 50 mg and
prednisone 60 mg (increased from 30 mg at [**Hospital1 1501**]).  A renal
transplant consult was called on hospital day 3.  They
