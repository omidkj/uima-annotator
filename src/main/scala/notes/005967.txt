CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15 to
20 percent, severe dilated cardiopathy with chronic pulmonary
hypertension who presents with class 4 heart failure
symptoms.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
gentleman with a history of severe dilated cardiomyopathy
diagnosed in [**2142**] by catheterization, at which time he was
found to have normal coronaries and elevated PA pressures of
80/45 with a cardiac output of 2.9 and 4+ mitral
regurgitation.  Since the summer of [**2147**] patient has been
stable.  It has been class 2 heart failure maintained on ACE
inhibitor, Lasix, Digoxin and amiodarone.  In [**2148-5-15**], the patient had deterioration in his status with
increased fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain.  Patient
was found to be H. pylori positive, treated with antibiotics
and on [**4-23**] had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed
chronic inactive gastritis.  At the end of [**Month (only) 547**] the patient
noted worsening of dyspnea on exertion as well as orthopnea.
Metricor and Lasix were administered.  Patient was admitted
for cardiac catheterization and for inotropic therapy.  At a
catheterization on the day of admission the PA pressures were
66/26.  Cardiac index was 1.4.  His pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 24.  He had limited angiography but a patent
LAD.  Patient was started on milrinone of .5 and his PA
pressures were 64/22 and a cardiac index of 1.9 in the
catheterization laboratory.  Patient was transferred to the
Cardiac Care Unit for milrinone therapy and tailored therapy.
On arrival to the Cardiac Care Unit patient denied any chest
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, palpitations,
nausea or vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Congestive heart failure:  severe
dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed in [**2142**], echocardiogram in
[**2148-4-15**] showed ejection fraction of 15 to 20 percent,
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis, severe global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis, 1% atrial
regurgitation, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation, catheterization in [**2142**] showed normal
coronaries with a cardiac output of 2.9 and an index of 1.4.
2) History of peptic ulcer disease with H. pylori treated.
3) History of hypertension.  4) History of supraventricular
tachycardia on Holter in [**2148-1-16**].  5) History of left
bundle and intraventricular conduction delay.  6)
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy in [**4-16**] with chronic gastritis.
7) History of positive PPD.

No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  On admission white count 5.4,
hematocrit 33.8, platelets 218, sodium 136, potassium 4.6,
chloride 100, bicarb 25, BUN 36 and creatinine 2.1, baseline
1.3 to 2.1.  PTT 16.6 and INR of 1.9.  ALT 25, AST 27, alk
phos 48, total bilirubin 1.0.  Normal thyroid function tests.
Arterial blood gases in the catheterization laboratory of

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 62 year-old gentleman with
class 4 congestive heart failure and a severe dilating
cardiomyopathy admitted for hemodynamic monitoring and
Noridone therapy.

1.      Cardiovascular - coronaries:  the patient had normal
cardiac catheterization and flat CK's.  No evidence of
ischemia.

        Heart Failure:  Patient was class 4 congestive heart
failure
and severe dilating cardiomyopathy on milrinone therapy which
was started at .4 mcg per minute which was ultimately
titrated down during the hospital course to .3 due to
hypotension.  Patient remained on milrinone throughout his
hospital stay.  The patient's cardiac output improved to 3.9.
He was continued on his Coreg, Captopril, amiodarone,
aldactone, Lasix, Digoxin.  The dosages of these medications
were titrated down during his hospital stay due to
hypotension.  He was discharged on the doses as follows.
Amiodarone 200, Lasix 20, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d., Coreg 12.5
t.i.d., Aldactone 12.5 q.d., Digoxin .0125 q.d. and Coumadin
4 q.d.  The patient noted that throughout his hospital stay
his symptoms of dyspnea and gnawing abdominal pain resolved
such that he was able to ambulate multiple times daily as
well as climb stairs without experiencing any symptoms.  He
had a definite improvement in his symptomatology related to
his class 4 congestive heart failure.  He was seen by the EP
consultation service who decided he was not a candidate for
biventricular pacing due to his significant mitral
regurgitation, however, they agreed that a DDD pacer would be
potentially beneficial for increased heart rate to increase
the patient' cardiac output.  On [**5-24**] the patient had a DDD
pacemaker placed without any complications and it has been
functioning within normal limits throughout his hospital
stay.  That was placed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  The Swan-Ganz
catheter was removed after the pacemaker was placed, and
patient was continued on his doses of milranone.  His
symptoms and his weight were monitored closely.  Patient was
evaluated by a transplant team, including Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **],
from [**Hospital 10908**] regarding the possibilities of a heart transplant in
the future. Because of chronic severe pulmonary hypertension,
transition from He The patient decided along with his family
transition from He ambulatory Heart Mate LVAD to
transplantation was recommendeundergo a heartD to
transplantation was discussed. He decided that he was not
willing to receive blood transfusion, due to his religious
beliefs, which has very high likelihood of being required as
life saving therapy during both procedures. Further discussion
of this will ensue with his family anbd religious advisors.
He was discharged home on intravenous home Milrinone therapy
and will be follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of the
heart failure service and can readdress the
issues surrounding transplant at that time.

        Rhythm:  Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm, AV
paced after his DDD was placed on th 10th.  He had no events
on telemetry during his hospital stay.  He has a history of
atrial fibrillation but remained in normal sinus rhythm.  He
had been on heparin prior to the DDD pacer placement, and was
restarted on Coumadin afterward.  He was also continued on
his amiodarone but at a lower dose as noted above.

2.      Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of
gastritis and gnawing abdominal pain.  He was continued on
his Protonix and Carafate.  He was also continued on his two
gram sodium diet with full calorie and 2 liter fluid
restriction.  His daily weights were monitored.Abdominal pain
resolved with improvement in hemodynamics and diuresis.

3.      Renal:  Patient's creatinine improved during his
hospital stay such that his creatinine returned to his
baseline prior
