HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88[**Hospital 4622**]
transfer from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital who presented with fevers and
jaundice.

The patient is an 88-year-old gentleman with a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, recent motor vehicle
accident who is now transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with fevers, jaundice,
and elevated liver function tests, status post an episode of
ventricular tachycardia which has been cardioverted.

The patient presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2173-9-13**]
with a 2-day history of nausea, and decreased oral intake,
epigastric right-sided abdominal pain/discomfort, and
yellowish skin.  The patient was noted to have a temperature
of 100, a total bilirubin of 12.2, a direct bilirubin of 4.3,
an alkaline phosphatase of 521, and transaminases in the 90s.

A computed tomography of the abdomen showed intrahepatic and
extrahepatic ductal dilatation.  Common bile duct dilated to
ampulla with a questionable stone near ampulla of Vater.  At
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, the patient was admitted and kept nothing
by mouth.  The patient was given intravenous fluids plus
Zosyn with plans for endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.

Hospital course at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital showed culture positive
for gram-negative rods in bottles of blood cultures.  On the
morning of transfer an episode of ventricular tachycardia to
150.  The patient was asymptomatic but with decreased blood
pressures to 92/62.  He was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit, and cardioverted, and started on an amiodarone bolus
plus drip, and since cardioverted to a normal sinus rhythm,
and has been having stable blood pressures.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further workup.

Here at [**Hospital1 **], we have an 88-year-old
gentleman with coronary artery disease, hypertension,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, now with cholangitis, and
gram-negative rod bacteremia, status post ventricular
tachycardia, with cardioversion (on amiodarone) which is
getting worked up.  He was here to be evaluated by the
Electrophysiology Service.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   On admission to [**Hospital1 1444**] his vital signs revealed
temperature was 94.7 degrees Fahrenheit, his blood pressure
was 103/45, his heart rate was 65, his respiratory rate was
15, and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air.  On
general physical examination, the patient was a pleasant
elderly male, well-nourished, and in no acute distress.
Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed he
had positive jaundice.  He had bilateral scleral icterus.
The mucous membranes were dry.  Positive mucosal jaundice.
On lung examination, he crackles at the right base;
otherwise, clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed occasional extra beats, irregular, and
distant heart sounds.  No murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  The
abdomen was soft and nontender.  Bowel sounds were present.
The liver edge was at 2 cm below the costal margin.  No
splenomegaly.  Extremities were dry and cool.  He had 1+
pulses bilaterally in the lower extremities.  He had an
amputated right arm.  Neurologic examination revealed the
patient was alert and oriented times three.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital were as follows.  His sodium was 135,
his potassium was 3.2, his chloride was 103, his bicarbonate
was 22, his blood urea nitrogen was 18, his creatinine was
1.4, and his blood glucose was 89.  His calcium was 9.9.  His
INR was 1.4.  His partial thromboplastin time was 26.4.
White blood cell count was 13.5, hemoglobin was 12.1,
hematocrit was 37.2, and platelets were 190.  Differential
with 78% neutrophils, 2% lymphocytes, and 17% bands.  Albumin
was 3.  His total bilirubin was 11.2, his direct bilirubin
was 4.3, his amylase was 180, his lipase was 184, his
alkaline phosphatase was 521, his AST was 82, and his ALT was
95.  Urinalysis was brown/clear, greater than 1.03 specific
gravity, pH was 5.5.  There were small leukocytes, 30
protein, trace ketones, plus bilirubin, plus nitrites, 3 to 5
white blood cells, occasional epithelial cells.  Blood
cultures revealed gram-negative rods; identification and
sensitivities were pending.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed low lung
volumes with increased patchy consolidation at the right
base.

On [**2173-5-4**] an echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 190**] showed mild symmetrical left ventricular
hypertrophy, moderately depressed left ventricular ejection
fraction, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.

Electrocardiogram also showed sinus at 76 with occasional
premature ventricular contractions.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since admission, the
patient received an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography on [**9-16**] and sphincterotomy
secondary to his cholangitis without any complications.

In summary, the patient is an 88-year-old gentleman with
coronary artery disease (status post 2-vessel stent in [**2173-5-4**]) with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and known
ventricular tachycardia with a hospitalization on [**9-15**]
at an outside hospital for acute cholangitis who developed
ventricular tachycardia and bacteremia (specifically
Klebsiella).  He was then cardioverted and transferred to the
[**Hospital1 69**] for endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy.  The
patient is now transferred to the Electrophysiology Service
for electrophysiology consultation.

The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  His
most acute issues since he has been on the service was
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, ablated through
electrophysiology, without any complications.  Although, on
telemetry, occasional premature ventricular contractions
persisted.  He had nonsustained runs of ventricular
tachycardia; specifically 4 to 5 premature ventricular
contraction that were present.  The patient was stable and
without any complications.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  Since he has been on
this service, for his coronary artery disease, he was ruled
out for a myocardial infarction.  He was continued on
aspirin, statin, and metoprolol.  He has been on a cardiac
healthy diet and he was continued on his Plavix since he was
status post catheterization.

2.  ARRHYTHMIA AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  He was
continued on his amiodarone.  For his ventricular tachycardia
he was continued on his amiodarone, metoprolol, and
electrophysiology had ablated the ventricular tachycardia
site successfully.

3.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient with slight anemia.
Recently, for the past two days, he developed a slight drop
in his hematocrit and guaiac-positive stools, which since has
been stabilized on his hematocrit level with no active
bleeding or active issues.  The patient is being followed
closely by Gastroenterology, and the source of
guaiac-positive stool is unknown; although Gastroenterology
has noted that post sphincterotomy guaiac-positive stool is
to be expected.  Also, he had 1+ hyperchromic, 1 target cell,
1 burr cell, and no microcytic anemia.  The burr cell could
be an artifact.  The target cell could be secondary to
increased cell membrane or decreased cell volume; so it could
be obstructive liver disease or reduced hemoglobin as in iron
deficiency thalassemia or liver disease; although less likely
in this case.

4.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His oxygen saturations were monitored closely,
and he was saturating well.

5.  RIGHT ARM WOUND ISSUES:  Wound care, status post surgery,
following motor vehicle accident, was getting changed
regularly.

6.  CHOLANGITIS ISSUES:  The etiology of his cholangitis was
unclear.  This was most likely related to cholelithiasis and
stasis in the biliary tract and obstructive liver disease;
also correlate to the finding of burr cells also (which was
mentioned above).  He was continued on levofloxacin.  His
liver function tests were monitored.  His albumin,
prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin
