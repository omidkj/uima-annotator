REPORT


INDICATION: 51-year-old post-mitral valve replacement with right
leg
weakness.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain
without IV
contrast including axial FLAIR, gradient echo, and
diffusion-weighted
sequences. MR angiogram of the brain with 3D time-of-flight and
multiplanar
reformatted images.

No prior studies.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Numerous areas of focal
increased T2
and FLAIR signal intensity are seen within the white matter of
both cerebral
hemispheres as well as in the periventricular white matter
surrounding both
lateral ventricles. Numerous focal rounded areas of
susceptibility artifact
are also seen within the cortex and subcortical white matter of
both cerebral
hemispheres. Some of these may represent flow-related artifact.
There is no
restricted diffusion. No structural brain abnormality is seen on
T1-weighted
images. Ventricles and sulci are normal in appearance.

MR ANGIOGRAM: Normal signal intensity is seen within both
vertebral, both
internal carotid, the basilar, and circle of [**Location (un) 431**] arteries and
branch
vessels. There is a dominant left anteroinferior cerebellar
artery. No flow-
limiting stenosis or area of aneurysmal dilation is seen.

IMPRESSION:

1. MRI [**Location (un) 4059**] small vessel ischemic changes.

2. Areas of susceptibility on gradient echo images may represent
early
amyloid angiopathy or sequela from prior small emboli.

3. MR [**First Name (Titles) 20827**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4059**] no flow-limiting stenosis or
aneurysmal
dilation.

Findings were communicated with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 20286**] on the morning of [**6-14**], [**2184**].



THE STUDY AND THE REPORT WERE REVIEWED BY THE STAFF RADIOLOGIST.

FINAL REPORT


HISTORY: Effusion.

PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate interval
removal of the
two right jugular central venous catheters seen on [**2185-6-8**].
Prosthetic
cardiac valve is unchanged. There is widening of the
acromioclavicular joint
and probable resection of distal right clavicle. There is no
pneumothorax.
The lungs are clear. Trachea is midline. There is a small
right-sided
pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:

Interval removal of right jugular central venous catheters. No
pneumothorax.

Resolution of previously described congestive heart failure.
Small persistent
right pleural effusion.

Procedure Date:[**2185-6-11**]

FINAL REPORT


INDICATION: Status post mitral valve replacement, evaluate for
right groin
hematoma.

FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right groin
were performed.
Common femoral vein and artery appear unremarkable without
evidence of fistula
or pseudoaneurysm. No fluid collections are identified.
Ultrasound over
the patient's area of pain in the right thigh area [**Name (NI) 4059**]
patent vessels
without evidence of abnormal fluid collection.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of right groin hematoma, fistula or
pseudoaneurysm.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1) No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%).

2) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta
are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.

3) The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.

4) there is a long anterior mitral leaflet with a probable
myxomatous appearance. The posterior leaflet is small or
retracted. There is an eccentric regurgitant jet with reversal
in pumonary veins c/w severe mitral regurgitation.
C-[**Month (only) **] distance is 3.0cm. Mitral annulus is 3.7cm.

Post-Bypass (1):
A prosthetic ring is seen in mitral annulus stable in position.
Preserved biventricular systolic function. Aortic contour is
well preserved. There is a mitral regurgitant jet, eccentric
seen well in MVLAX view c/w a moderate or atleast a mild to
moderate regurgitation.

Post-Bypass (2):
A mechanical prosthetic valve is seen in the mitral position,
stable inpositon and both the leaflets are opening and closing
well. Peak transmital gradient is 5mm of Hg and a mean of 3mm of
Hg (immediate post-bypass).
Preserved biventricular systolic function. Aortic contour is
well preserved. Trivial MR and no AI.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**6-7**] and underwent minimally invasive mitral valve
replacement with a mechanical valve. Transferred to the CSRU in
stable condition on titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips.
On nipride and insulin drips on POD #1, and did not extubate
until later in the day. Chest tubes removed that evening and pt.
c/o pain and paresthesia of right inner thigh. Coumadin started
that evening,all drips off, and transferred to the floor on POD
#2 to begin to increase her activity level. Gentle diuresis and
beta blockade started and heparin continued until INR
therapeutic. Neurology consult obtained for right thigh pain on
POD #3. Vascular service also consulted and CT scanning /US
completed for the femoral neuropathy. All exams negative for
hematoma or fluid collection.Neurontin started per neurology and
follow up encouraged with neurology clinic post-discharge.Right
leg pain im
