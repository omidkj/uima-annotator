Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers and alcohol withdrawal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 41 year-old female with a history of ETOH abuse and
withdrawals, no h/o seizures, cirrhosis who presented to her
[**Hospital 6435**] clinic this AM with her sister shaking, febrile,
tachycardic, with slurred speech.  She states that her last ETOH
was >12 hrs prior.  At the time, she was A/O x 3; and was sent
to the ED for further evaluation.  During the time of this note,
the patient was intubated, so history obtained from records and
sister.  [**Name (NI) **] the sister, the patient has had significant ETOH
history, and her BF, who apparently stays with her, also has
significant ETOH abuse h/o.  The patient reportedly had not been
eating well, had been lying in bed, and not taking care of
herself.  Last week, her sister was concerned about her
wellbeing and took her to [**Hospital1 112**] ED, where her BF helped her sign
out AMA per the sister.  This AM, she was reportedly shaky, eyes
were crusted over, and her face appeared swollen.  The sister
did not know whether the patient was having any fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain at all.  Per the sister, the
patient has been section 35 in the past, and recently tried
again but was unsuccessful.

In the ED, intial vitals were 101.6, 105/71, 134, 22, 100% RA.
She was agitated, hypertensive, and tachycardic.  She was
[**Doctor Last Name **] >20 on the CIWA scale, and received 100 mg of valium
overall.  This caused her to be somnolent, despite tachycardia,
and eventually was intubated for airway protection. She was
started on fentanyl/midazolam for sedation.  Given her fever, an
infection workup was initiated, she had a positive UA, cultures
pending.  CXR was negative. Blood cultures were pending.  A RUQ
for the elevated LFTs was done w/o e/o cholecystitis or PV
thrombosis.  The patietn was given vanco/levo/flagyl in the ED.
She had 3 PIVs placed and was given 5L of NS prior to transfer.

Past Medical History:
Chronic alcoholism and cirrhosis presumed due to alcoholism.  No
records here.  Attempts (faxed requests with permissions) for
records from her PCP and community health center have been
fruitless.
ETOH Abuse- withdrawals but no seizure
Cirrhosis

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 80562**] with alcoholic, and, reportedly abuse,
boyfriend.
Unemployed.  [**Name2 (NI) **] 3 children.  1 PPD. at least 0.5-1 pt vodka.
Sister doesn't think patient uses any drugs

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:   Patient was at her PCPs office on the day of
admission shaking, tachycardic and with slurred speech noting
that her last drink was 12hour previously.   A family member
brought her to the emergency department because of concern that
she might be withdrawing from alcohol.  In ER, she was given
approx 100mg of valium with resulting somnolence and then
intubated for airway protection on [**2138-3-12**]-->MICU. She was
extubated the next day, but remained in the ICU for several days
for close CIWA monitoring.  She remained intermittently
confused, with the etiology being a combination of withdrawal
delirium, hepatic encephalopathy, and benzodiazepine
intoxication.  She did spike a temperature during her [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay
and grew GPCs from her sputum on [**2138-3-13**].  Consequently, she was
started on vancomycin for PNA. Also found to have UTI(E. coli.)
for which she was treated with bactrim. These antibiotics were
later converted to Ctx/Azithro to cover for possible CAP, UTI,
?peritonitis given persistant fevers/encephelopathy (completed
course). Transfered to Gen Med [**3-17**]. Pt. with continued
tremulousness, encephalopathy, fevers, tachycardia on
presentation.  Felt that continued ETOH withdrawal very
unlikely, especially given 100 mg vailum given per ED record.
Discontinued CIWA and benzos.  Gave aggressive bowel regimen of
lactulose and rifaximin for likely hepatic encephalopathy.
Repeated u/s to eval for ascites, none seen, although present on
examination.  Changed abx to CTX/Azithromycin to cover
empirically for CAP, UTI ([**Last Name (un) 36**] e coli), and peritonitis.
Started spirinolactone for ascites.  MS improved rapidly over 24
hours.  Fevers and tachycardia persisted, however.  Repeat
infectious w/u undertaken - Blood ngtd, cdiff neg times three,
no evidence of dvt, CXR w/ ? of new, lt. mid lung opacity, UA
negative, CTA neg for PE. Remained stable off Abx, last temp
[**3-19**], persistant low grade temps to 100s thought to be [**3-10**] ETOH
hepatitis vs Atx (seen on multiple Xrays). Has tachycardia a/w
low fevers, but otw HR in 90s. Fevers should no be worked up
unless spike >101.4. Provide Incentive spirometery.   Was
significantly orthostatic on vitals signs but asymptomatic. This
did not change with IVFs and is likely [**3-10**] autonomic
dysfuction/neuropathy from ETOh as well. Reccommend Stockings
and low dose florinef. Also peripheral neuropathy with pain in
feet, neurontin started/titrated. Seen by neuro and agree that
all ETOH related, unlikely anything other central, but if
worsens, can f/u neuro. started on vitamins. There were issues
with dispo expressed by her sister, who stated that pt has an
abuse boyfriend who currently lives in her apartment and who is
main influence to pt's persistant ETOH abuse. She was kept in
privacy alert. Sister did not feel comfortable taking pt home
given complicated medical issues. Thus pt t/f to [**Hospital1 1501**] on
discharge.

41year old female with h/o longstanding ETOH abuse with ETOH
related liver disease (fibrosis vs cirrhosis) admitted to MICU
[**3-12**] with fevers, acute ETOH withdrawal, MS changes, s/p
intubation, ETOH withdrawal (valium), transfered to floor [**3-16**].
Hospital course complicated by UTI s/p Abx, ?PNA s/p Abx,
encephelopathy thought to be [**3-10**] ETOH liver disease (improved).
Other issues are persistant low grade fevers associated with
tachycardia (ETOH hepatitis vs atelectasis) with negative
workup. Worked up for polyneuropathy (autonomic
dysfunction/neuropathy), thought to be [**3-10**] ETOH neuropathy per
neurology. Now stable for discharge to Rehab.

Orthostatic hypotension: taking good PO, appears hydrated.
ASYMPTOMATIC. Likely [**3-10**] autonomic insuff from ETOH neuropathy.
Haver tried to hydrate further with IVFs with persistant
orthostasis.
