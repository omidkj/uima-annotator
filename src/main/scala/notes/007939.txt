Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Senna / Iodine / Optiray 350

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p l chest pigtail catheter


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 yo woman well known to our service as she
redo sternotomy/bentall with Freestyle graft/CABGx1 with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**2125-10-22**]. Her post-op course was complicated by
pericardial effusion and tamponade requiring return to the OR
for mediastinal exploration.  She did develop dysrhythmias,
including rapid a-fib, for which she was unsuccessfully
cardioverted.  EP was
consulted.  Medications were adjusted and seh did convert to SR
prior to discharge.  Coumadin was not resumed post-operatively
due to post-op bleeding and sinus rhythm at the time of
discharge.  She did require CVVH post-operatively for volume
overload and was transitioned to HD, then weaned from HD.  She
also developed Serratia bacteremia which was treated with cipro,
and blood cultures were clear prior to discharge.  Urinalysis
was positive on discharge, and the patient was maintained on
cipro pending culture and sensitivity.
She returns to the ED today c/o vague abdominal pain and is
found to be hypotensive with SBP in the 60s in the ED.  Central
line is placed, levophed is started and CT Abdomen is pending.
Initial bedside echo does not reveal evidence of pericardial
effusion.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for effusion
Final Report
HISTORY: Status post cardiac surgery, to assess for change.

FINDINGS:

In comparison with the study of [**11-21**], the monitoring and support
devices
remain in place. There is a small reaccumulation of left pleural
fluid,
without definite pneumothorax. The effusion and atelectasis at
the right base
are less prominent. The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion
has
decreased. Moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and the
extensive heavy
mitral annulus calcification is again seen.
