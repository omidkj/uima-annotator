History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old man with a h/o atrial fibrillation
transferred from an outside hospital for unresponsiveness
(intubated/sedated at OSH).  Patient reportedly has not been his
"normal self" lately.  He has been more agitated (getting
ativan), confused, and lethargic at times.  He had had several
hospital visits for a pneumonia and had been on vancomycin and
levoquin.  Patient reportedly found unresponsive with "eyes
rolled back".  He was not shaking or tremoring.  An ambulance
was called and he was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  There he was
found to be minimally responsive, blood pressures 170s to 180s
over 80's, with a fever to 102.2, his blood sugar was 61, and
NIH stroke scale was calculated at 24 primarily for minimal
movement on the right, no verbal output, and decreased level of
attention.  He was treated with unasyn, levaquin, IVF and loaded
with dilantin.
Two hours later the patient received a head ct which showed a
left frontal hypodensity.  Three hours later, he remained
lethargic and was intubated for airway protection (etomidate,
succin., vecuron.).  He was transferred and arrived at [**Hospital1 18**]
approximately 90 minutes later.

EXAM AT DISCHARGE:


Pertinent Results:
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-5-9**] 9:04 PM
MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF [**Location (un) **]
CLINICAL INDICATION: Infarction and neurologic deficit.

Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain was
obtained. MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was performed according to
standard departmental protocol.

No prior brain MRIs are available for comparison. There is a
moderate-sized area of diffusion abnormality involving the left
frontal lobe and a smaller region involving the left internal
capsule consistent with areas of subacute infarction. These
might contain byproduct of blood due to susceptibility. The
ventricular system is symmetrical without hydrocephalus.

Scattered areas of magnetic susceptibility are noted within the
left basal ganglia and the right parietal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white junction.
These could represent areas of hemosiderin deposition or foci of
amyloid angiopathy. Correlation with CT of the brain would be
helpful to exclude the possibility of hemorrhagic lesions. T2
hyperintensity is noted within the brainstem and periventricular
white matter suggestive of chronic microvascular ischemic or
gliotic changes. No subdural hemorrhage is seen. The study is
degraded by motion artifact. There is opacification of the
paranasal sinuses.

Signal flow voids are present along the intracranial portions of
the carotid and basilar arteries. There is absence of signal
flow void within the right vertebral artery suggestive of total
occlusion.

IMPRESSION: Diffusion abnormality involving the left internal
capsule and the left frontal lobe most likely consistent with
areas of subacute infarction. Overall study was degraded by a
motion artifact. Scattered foci of magnetic susceptibility
suggestive of possible amyloid angiopathy. There is suggestion
of a small left-sided developmental venous anomaly involving the
left parietal lobe. Correlation with gadolinium-enhanced images
might be helpful along with followup. Areas of chronic ischemia
are seen within the brainstem and thalami.

MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] was performed according to standard
departmental protocol. There is significant ectasia and
dilatation of the distal vertebrobasilar circulation with slight
aneurysmal fusiform dilatation of the proximal basilar artery.
There is significant tortuosity of the cavernous ICA. The right
distal vertebral artery is not visualized and is probably
totally excluded. No intracranial aneurysms are seen involving
the anterior or middle cerebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: Significant ectasia of the distal vertebrobasilar
circulation with mild fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the
proximal basilar artery. Total occlusion of the right distal
vertebral artery. The intracranial circulation was otherwise
patent.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2128-5-11**] 9:20 AM
FINDINGS: There is redemonstration of the large left posterior
frontal acute infarction with a small amount of hemorrhagic
contents. Infarction also appears to extend to the posterior
limb of the left internal capsule where the largest hemorrhagic
component, approximately 3 mm in size is visualized. These
findings were demonstrated on the prior MR study. There is a
minor amount of mass effect caused by the infarct, as shown by
continued demonstration of a few millimeters rightward bowing of
the septum pellucidum. There has been no change in ventricular
size. The prominently ectatic and partially calcified visualized
distal left vertebral artery as well as basilar artery are
imaged. There are likely ectatic as well as calcified components
involving the cavernous portion of the left internal carotid
artery with atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous
portion of the right internal carotid artery. There is a
moderate amount of mucosal thickening in the right ethmoid
sinus, with a meniscus-shaped soft tissue density, probably
fluid and mucosal thickening, within the posterior aspect of the
right and left sphenoid air cells.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT  [**2128-5-10**] 1:03 PM
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. Minimal plaque was identified.
On the right, peak systolic velocities are 107, 84, 104 in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.3.
This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis.
On the left, peak systolic velocities are 115, 92, 140 in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.3.
This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis. The right
vertebral artery was not visualized due to an IV line and the
jugular vein. There is antegrade flow in left vertebral artery.

IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40% carotid
stenosis.
