Pertinent Results:
fMRI
The expected activation areas during the functional paradigms
were demonstrated, during the movement of the right hand, there
is no evidence of areas close to the left frontal neoplasm.
During the movement of the tongue and language paradigms, areas
of activation were demonstrated anterior to the mass lesion in
the frontal lobe

[**4-26**] MRI Brain: CONCLUSION: Preoperative localization for tumor
surgery. The cortical infiltration is compatible with a glioma.
The focus of enhancement suggests the lesion may be higher than
grade II.

[**4-25**] Head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Status post left temporal tumor resection with pneumocephalus
and tiny
blood products post-surgical at the surgical bed.
2. Persistent vasogenic edema in the left frontotemporal region.

3. Mild interval worsening of hypodensity at the left frontal
white matter
near surgical bed, could be mild interval worsening edema;
however, cannot
exclude focal ischemia.
4. No large acute hemorrhage.

[**4-25**] MRI Brain (post op):IMPRESSION: Status post resection of
left temporal and posterior frontal mass. Small residual area of
enhancement at the superior aspect of the surgical cavity is
identified. No significant increase in edema is seen, but slow
diffusion is seen at the margin of the surgical cavity with a
small focus more deeper to the margin of the surgical cavity
which could be related to ischemia or could also be due to
postoperative change. No territorial infarcts are seen, however.


[**4-26**] Head CT: IMPRESSION:
No evidence of new hemorrhage. Increased parafalcine air likely
represents
redistribution of moderate pneumocephalus. Vasogenic edema and
blood products at the resection site appear stable. There is
persistent extension of hypodensity into the left frontal lobe,
which may represent vasogenic edema.

[**4-30**] CTA Chest:
1. Very extensive, acute pulmonary embolism with associated
pulmonary
arterial and right ventricular hypertension.
2. Incidental finding of left thyroid nodule, ultrasound
evaluation, when
clinically appropriate, is suggested.

[**4-30**] Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasound: No evidence of deep
venous thrombosis in bilateral lower extremity.

[**5-1**] Transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is elongated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**5-1**] Ct Head: Stable appearance of the left parietal lobe
resection bed, with minimal post-surgical blood products and
surrounding frontoparietal edema.  Stable minimal rightward
shift of midline structures and effacement of the left cerebral
hemispheric sulci. No new intracranial hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively for a left sided craniotomy for
resection of mass on [**2194-4-25**]. Surgery was without complication
but upon awakening the patient was right hemiplegia. A CT was
performed immediately which showed no hemorrhage or obvious
infarct. An MRI was performed that night which demonstrated no
evidence of CVA. Over the ensuing days, the patient's neurologic
examination improved. The initial deficit was attributed to a
temporary supplemental area syndrome.

On [**4-29**] PT and OT were ordered for assistance with discharge
planning. They recommended rehab. The patient worked with case
management trying to make a plan with regards to his insurance.

On [**4-30**] the patient remained neurologically stable. While
ambulating with physical therapy in the afternoon the patient
became hypotensive with decreased oxygen saturations and
complained of anxiety. LENI's and a CTA were ordered to evaluate
for DVT and PE. CTA revealed multiple PEs in all segmental
arteries. A medicine consult was obtained and patient was
transferred to SDU. He was started on a heparin gtt with a bolus
of 3000 units and then 1800 units/hr for a goal PTT of 60-100. A
head CT was done to evaluate for hemorrhage before heparin was
initiated and showed stable postop findings. Echocardiogram and
EKG were ordered to evaluate for further clots and
abnormalities, results as decribed in Pertinent Results section.
Lower extremity dopplers were negative for DVT. He c/o
intermittent chest pain with deep inspiration, at times [**8-24**] and
described as a cramping pain.

On [**5-1**] he continued on the heparin gtt with close monitoring of
PTT and was trasitioned to Coumadin.  He received his first dose
of Coumadin 5mg on [**5-1**], followed by 5mg on [**5-2**], and 3mg on
[**5-
