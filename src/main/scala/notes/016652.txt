Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
dysuria, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD and Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
82yo F with PMH significant for CHF, CAD, type II DM, PVD, and
CRI (Cr ranged from 1.4 to 3.3 in last 4 months) who presents
with hypotension in setting of recurrent UTI. Pt first developed
sx od dysuria 1 week ago and gave UA/urine cx to VNA for
testing. Since then, has had persistent dysuria and her baseline
incontinence, but no f/c/rigors/n/v/change in her back pain.
This AM, her daughter noted that the patient was "breathing
funny" while she was sleeping and when Ms. [**Known lastname 3142**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**], she
felt she was breathing harder so she went to the ER.
.
Per the ER, the patient was sent there in f/u for a positive
urine culture. On arrival to the ER, Ms. [**Known lastname 3142**] had a temp of
102, BP 122/80, HR 88. However, she quickly became hypotensive
to 77/40. Labs revealed a lactate of 2.8 and code sepsis was
initiated. She never had alteration in her mental status,
tachycardia, or respiratory distress. She had a central line
placed without incident and was given 1L of NS and 1u pRBC with
improvement in her SBP to 90s. She was then transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
Of note, the ER resident considered further imaging of the
patient's spine given her h/o of low back pain, recurrent UTIs
and the question of epidural abscess raised during her last
hospitalization earlier this month. She never obtained imaging
as discussed at that time. On physical exam, the ER resident
found decreased rectal tone, trace guaiac + stool, and saddle
anesthesia. However, the patient is unable to fit in the MRI
scanner on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**], is claustrophobic, and has refused
MRI in the past. A CT of the spine w/ contrast was not performed
given her rising Cr (1.9).
.

+ SOB (baseline), walks 10 ft before getting inc pain
(?claudication)

CXR: No evidence of CHF or increase in cardiac size.

L ankle XR: There is medial and lateral malleolar soft tissue
swelling without signs for fractures or dislocations. Extensive
vascular and soft tissue calcifications are seen throughout the
ankle. The talar dome is intact. There is enthesopathy at the
attachment of the Achilles tendon and a plantar spur present.

Colonoscopy: Normal colonoscopy to cecum
Additional notes: The efficiency of colonoscopy in detecting
lesions was discussed in detail with the patient. It was
explained that colon cancer and colon polyps may on rare
occasions be missed during a colonscopy. The attending was
present during the entire procedure Routine Post-Procedure
orders. No source of bleeding found, may follow up with
outpatient capsule endoscopy.

EGD: Normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Additional notes: The attending was present for the entire
procedure. Routine post-procedure orders. No source of bleeding.
Follow up with outpatient capsule endoscopy.


Brief Hospital Course:
# SEPSIS: Unclear why sepsis protocol was initiated, given that
lactate was only 2.8, but patient improved since its initiation.
 Patient has pseudomonal UTI and back pain. Treated for
urosepsis, probable pyelonephritis. Improved on cefepime and
completed 2 week course. Had a UA on discharge that was checked
showing continued pyuria, but had just completed 2 weeks of
antibiotics. She will need a repeat UA and UCx followed up in
the next week as an outpatient. She should follow up with her
urologist.
.
# DECREASED RECTAL TONE: Unclear etiology, however exam appears
stable from earlier this month and clinical history does not
support an acute change. Most optimal study, after talking with
both neurology and radiology, would be MRI. If not MRI, then CT
of spine w/ contrast. Very little utility in CT of the spine w/o
contrast in this situation. Since her neuro exam appeared
stable, decision was made to hold off on attempting imaging as
patient refused MRI. She is willing to have an outpatient open
MRI howe
