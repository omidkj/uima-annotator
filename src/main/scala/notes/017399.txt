History of Present Illness:
53 year-old right-handed woman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] who
presented with increasing weakness and dyspnea. Mrs. [**Known lastname 35087**] was
diagnosed with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] after presenting with diplopia
on [**2106-4-3**]. She was found to have positive Ach-R Abs. She
was admitted to the Neurology service from [**4-10**]
with complaints of shortness of breath as well as left lid
droop. It was felt that her shortness of breath was likely due
to anxiety rather than myasthenia and she was started on Paxil.
At that time, NIFs and vital capacity were normal and she had no
other fatiguable weakness besides the ocular symptoms. She was
also found to have a thymoma at that time.
.
She stated that for the past two weeks prior to this
presentation, she has had significant drooping of both eyelids,
which tends to be maximal at the end of the day. Over the past
two or three days, it has been so severe, that she needs to be
guided or carried by her husband in order to get around as she
cannot see.  She has not noted any diplopia.
.
She also noted that for the past week or so prior to
presentation, she has experienced noticeable dyspnea on
exertion. She does not feel that she has been weak in the arms
or legs, but that her tolerance for physical activity has
lessened.
.
For the past two days prior to presentation, she said that she
has had difficulty holding her head up straight. She often needs
to hold her head up with her hands to look straight.
.
The afternoon of admission, she became more short of breath,
mostly after short periods of exertion. She did mention that
this has made her somewhat anxious. She tried to lay down to
rest early in the evening, and said that not only did she have
difficulty breathing, but she was having difficulty clearing the
saliva from her throat. She said that this had never happened to
her in the past. She said that at present, her swallowing is
normal. She has not noticed any recent difficulty with chewing
or speaking.
.
On review of systems, the pt denied recent fever or chills. No
night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denied cough. Denied
chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria, but endorses urinary
frequency and hesitancy. Denied arthralgias, myalgias, or rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 35087**] is a 53 year-old woman with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] who
presented with myasthenic crisis. She has had a progressively
worsening course since diagnosis in late [**Month (only) 547**], though it is
possible that this exacerbation was secondary to a urinary tract
infection.
.
On arrival to the ED, the pt appeared tachypneic. Respiratory
mechanics were performed immediately and she had a NIF of -34
and FVC of 550cc (which is in [**Doctor Last Name 29943**] contrast to reportedly
normal values during admission in late [**Month (only) 547**]). She was
electively intubated for airway protection as respiratory
failure was deemed imminent given her examination and
respiratory mechanics.
.
She was admitted to the Neurology ICU for further management.
.
Hospital course is reviewed below by problem:
.
1. myasthenia crisis: After admission to the ICU, a
plasmapheresis catheter was placed and plasma exchange was
initiated on [**4-30**]. She was treated with five sessions every
other day, with last session [**5-8**]. She was also started on
prednisone at 10mg every other day with increase by 10mg every
three days (at 90 mg QOD on discharge, with goal to titrate to
100 mg QOD on [**6-2**]). She was also started on cellcept with
titration after one week to a goal of 1000mg [**Hospital1 **].  At the end of
her first session of plasmapheresis she had an episode of sepsis
(see below) and a subsequent deterioration in her strength.  She
made only slow improvement after this, so a decision was made to
proceed with a second course of plasmapheresis, which she
received from [**Date range (1) 35088**].  Her exam slowly improved with this.
Her mestinon was initially held given that it was felt to
increase her risk of secretions while intubated.  After she was
stable post-tracheostomy for seve
