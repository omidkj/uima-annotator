Altered Mental Stauts, Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
75F h/o COPD on home O2, DM2 p/w AMS and SOB. Increased work of
breathing this AM prior to church. At baseline short of breath
with minimal exertion. After service family noted that she was
increasingly somnolent and confused, called 911. Brought to ED
for eval where found to be unresponsive.
.
In the ED, hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Tried narcan
because pinpoint pupils but did not help. Initial ABG
7.09/122/77. Intubated and repeat ABG 7.10/113/221. Labs notable
for normal WBC and lactate. Urine and serum tox negative. Given
solumedrol 125mg IV and albuterol for COPD flare. CTX and levo
in case pneumonia although CXR not revealing. Admit to ICU.

Past Medical History:
COPD on 2L home O2
DM2
Dementia
HTN
Dyslipidemia
Goiter s/p RAI
R breast nodule
RUL opacity on CT--thought to be scarring from pneumonia, but
ddx cancer--referred to pulm for eval, but has not made appt yet

Social History:
The patient was born and grew up in [**Doctor First Name 26692**]. She has been
in [**Location (un) 86**] for many years. She smokes between one and two packs
of cigarettes a day and has a long smoking history. She no
longer drinks alcohol.

Family History:
The patient's father died at 71 of complications of diabetes.
The mother died in her 60s with hypertension, a car accident and
may be a stroke. She is the oldest of seven siblings of whom
only four are living. The causes of that are not clear. There is
no history of known dementia in the family.

Pertinent Results:
Single portable AP radiograph of the chest was performed.
Comparison is made with examination of [**2177-12-19**]:
FINDINGS: Again noted are old left-sided rib fractures. The
heart is enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular congestion. There
is no focal pulmonary consolidation. There may be small bibasal
effusions.
The ET tube is approximately 57 mm from the carina. The NG tube
is projected with its tip over the stomach.
CONCLUSION: Overall, findings are suggestive of CHF. The ET tube
is approximately 57 mm from the carina.

CT head [**2178-1-25**]: CONCLUSION:
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. Stable appearance
to the
chronic microvascular disease as seen before.

CTA chest [**2178-1-26**]:IMPRESSION:
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
2. Grossly unchanged approximately 5-mm pleural-based nodule in
right middle
lobe. This nodule has been stable over a period of two years.
3. Enlarged thyroid gland with the left lobe nodules. The
appearance is
grossly unchanged compared to prior study, but an ultrasound is
suggested for
better evaluation.
4. Severe emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
5. Stable reticular opacities in both apices, likely scar.
6. Dense calcifications in both breasts, stable since [**2175**].
Mammographic
correlation would be suggested.
7. New small amount of perihepatic fluid of unclear
significance. An
abdominal study would be suggested for better evaluation.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2178-1-26**] at 10:44:39 AM:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
patient is mechanically ventilated. The IVC is small, consistent
with an RA pressure of <10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with
mild right ventricular cavity dilation and borderline normal
free wall motion. Normal left ventricular size and function.
These findings are c/w a primary pulmonary process.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2174-8-29**], right ventricular function
is now borderline. The other findings, including the estimated
PA systolic pressure are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
A 75 year old lady with COPD on home oxygen admitted to the MICU
for respiratory failure and altered mental status secondary to
fluid overload on a COPD background.

1.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  The patient was admitted
to the MICU obtunded with hypercarbic respiratory failure and
fluid overload.  The patient had no history of congestive heart
failure to explain the overload.  The patient was sedated and
intubated.  Approximately 4 liters were diuresed, Azithromycin &
Prednisone were started to treat her COPD.
TTE on [**1-26**] revealed normal EF>60%, moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension with mild right ventricular cavity
dilation and borderline normal free wall motion. Normal left
ventricular size and function.
Her respiratory status improved and she was extubated
successfully on [**2178-1-28**]. She completed a 5 day course of
azithromycin on [**2178-1-30**]. She was transferred to the floor [**1-30**] in
stable condition and continued on a prednisone taper. She
required 1 liter of oxygen via nasal cannula at rest and with
activity to maintain sats>90%. She worked with physical therapy
and was able to climb stairs without desat on 3L liters nasal
cannula.

2.  Altered Mental status:  The patient was obtunded on
admission. CT head was negative for ICH.  Her mental status
improved with her respiratory status. It was at her baseline
when she was transferred to the floor.

3.  Diabetes: The patient was maintained on an Insulin sliding
scale monitored closely as she was started on steriods.

4. Hypertension: The patient was continued on Verapamil without
issues.

Dispo: her family did not feel that she was ready to come home,
she will go to rehab.
