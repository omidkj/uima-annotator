Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo RH woman with DMII, HTN, lung cancer, who
presents from home, found to be septic, unclear source, patient
notes LBP and ED wants to know if they should further
investigate
with MRI as she would likely need intubation for MRI.

She lives at home with her family and has not been feeling well
for the past few days.  Today she was sweaty, felt hot to her
son, and had an episode of loose stool incontinence after not
having had a BM x 5 days (unusual for her as she usually has one
stool a day).  She is always SOB, but today was a bit worse, and
she just felt "lifeless."  Her family states she was about to
pass out.  She notes that she has had low back pain for 3 days
(new for her), primarily just left to the midline, radiating
down
the back of both legs into the ankles.  She cannot qualify the
type of pain.  It currently is not there, as she said as soon as
she had the BM earlier today the back pain went away.  She
denies
recent trauma to her back, chiropractic manipulation, or needles
inserted into her back.  She was unable to lift herself off the
couch today due to the pain.  At baseline she walks with a
walker
well.  She denies headache or neck ache or neck stiffness.  She
also notes for the past week she has had left leg numbness, like
a pins and needles, down her left leg on the medial portion to
the inside of her foot (although is not currently present).  No
n/v, no urinary incontinence.  (She did stool on herself earlier
today, "it just came out" very loose stool.)  She notes her
voice
is always hoarse, this is not new for her.  No face droop,
strokes, or h/o back pain problems.

In the ED she was found to be hypotensive to SBP 60's, started
on
dopamine which then raised her HR, changed to neo synephrine.
Given Levaquin 500 and Flagyl 500, and fentanyl 100mcg.  Given 4
baby asa en route by EMS as there was concern for ST elevation
MI.  Cardiology saw patient, her EKG shows LBBB and an atrial
tachycardia.
