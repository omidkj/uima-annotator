Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure and hypertensive emergency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
49 y/o female with ESRD s/p 2 failed renal transplants on HD,
chronic HTN, T1DM s/p pancreas transplant, and CAD who presented
to the ED after a witnessed seizure. History is obtained through
hospital records and the patient's husband. At the time of
presentation to the MICU, pt was a poor historian and could not
relate her PMH or home medications.
.
The patient awoke around 3AM on the day of presentation and her
husband described her as confused and talking nonsense. This
episode resolved and the patient returned to sleep. In the AM on
the day of presentation, she was in her bathroom at home and her
husband witnessed a seizure around 7:30AM. He described tongue
biting and foaming of the mouth. He denies any incontinence;
however she does not make much urine and has an ileostomy. She
had tonic movements and her husband grabbed her hands and
lowered her to the ground. She sustained no head injury. EMS was
called and she was brought to the ED. She received Ativan 2 mg
IM which seemed to relieve some of her symptoms.

EEG [**2132-8-7**]
This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and drowsy
states due to the presence of multifocal shar regions along with
multifocal mixed frequency slowing seen in the left and right
temporal
regions. The first finding suggests multiple areas of cortical
irritability which could serve as foci for epileptogenesis. The
second
finding suggests areas of subcortical dysfunction. No
electrographic
seizures were noted.
.
Patient refused both LP and MRI


Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, intial vitals were T 98.8 HR 110 BP 222/125 RR 14 and
100%RA. She was given Ativan IV for a total of 4 mg. She was
given benadryl and Lopressor 5 mg IV x 2 and 25 mg PO. SBP
improved to the 180s. She was transferred to the MICU for BP and
neurological monitoring.  Once hemodynamically stable, she was
transferred to the medical floor for continued work-up of her
seizure and hypertensive emergency.
.
# S/p seizure.  Seizure activity was not observed while
inpatient.  She was initially ruled out for toxic and metabolic
causes with blood toxicology and electrolyte testing.  Head CT
was performed upon admit, and on hospital day #2 to assess for
acute intracranial pathology - both of which were negative.
Neurology was consulted and believed that multiple admissions
for confusion and elevated BP may represent missed seizures.
Per neuro recs, Mrs. [**Known lastname 13959**] was initially started on phenytoin
for seizure prophylaxis, but this medication was discontinued
and switched to Keppra once it was noted that phenyoin would
lower her tacrolimus level.   Throughout her stay she refused
MRI and LP despite explanation that her immunocompromised state
caused increased concern for an intracranial infection. EEG was
performed and revealed no ongoing seizure.  She was discharged
home on Keppra with Neurology follow-up.
- Keppra 37mg po BID
- Neurology follow-up [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2132-8-11**].

# Altered Mental Status.  When admitted was altered mental
status, initially thought to be a post-ictal state.  She was
treated with ativan for her seizure and transferred to the ICU
with some clearing of her mental status, however, by her third
day of hospitalization she continued to have altered mental
status of unclear etiology - whether due to benzodiazepines vs.
TCA withdrawal as her desipramine was held upon admit vs
metabolic vs hypertensive encephalopathy.  Electrolyte and ABG
analysis were unrevealing.  Hypertension was controlled and her
desipramine was restarted.  On the seventh day of admission,
psychiatric consult was obtained and suggested avoiding benzos
and narcotics; and to use the single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] of haldol to control
her agitation.  Following implementation of these suggestions,
her mental status improved dramatically and she was clear upon
discharge.
- Unclear etiology.  Cleared with avoidance of benzos/narcotics;
haldol used for agitation.
.
# Fluctuating Blood Pressure  - Admitted in hypertensive crisis
with BP likely elevated secondary to seizure and question of
recent compliance.  Patient stated she take lopressor and
enalapril on a PRN basis at home as she often has low BP.  She
takes them when her diastolic is 'greater than 100'.  Was then
started on Metoprolol 25mg TID and lisinopril 5mg with good
control for 24 hours.  She then became profoundly hypotensive to
SBP 70s, requiring TID midodrine and florinef per her home
regimen.  She was normotensive upon discharge and these two
medications were continued.
- Discharged on midodrine and florinef
.
# s/p renal and pancreas transplant ([**2127-2-28**]; 2nd renal
transplant [**2128-3-4**]) for T1DM now with failed renal tx on HD.
Throughout stay was kept on HD schedule MWF and continued on
Bactrim prophylaxis.  Renal medications of nephrocaps, procrit,
FeSO4 per HD protocol were continued. Immunosuppression of
imuran, prograf, and prednisone were continued at outpatient
levels.  Prograf levels were monitored, and once noted to be low
secondary to phenytoin, the phenytoin was immediately
discontinued.  Nephrology Transplant was consulted and
recommended Keppra for seizure management and reloading of
Prograf.  Dosing was increased to 4mg po BID.  On the day of
discharge, the level was therapeutic and p
