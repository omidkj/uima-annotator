Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6578**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
patient will be d/c with foley in place and urology f/u


History of Present Illness:
82yoF with moderate AS (valve area 1.0-1.2), HTN, AFib NOT on
home Coumadin, Alzheimer's dementia who came to the ED with
abdominal pain, s/p unwitnessed fall, unable to ambulate,
vomiting. On presentation, she was hypotensive, hypoxic, and had
bright red blood in her urine. She was found to have
extraperitoneal ruptured bladder and bilateral non-displaced
pubic rami fx's (R inferior and L superior).
.
She was seen by Urology and Surgery on admission for evaluation
of ruptured bladder as well as pelvic fractures. Surgical
intervention was not indicated for either problem. [**Name (NI) 8389**] placed
for decompression.
.
Regarding hypotension/hypoxia, she was given IVF resuscitation
for hypotension and presumably became volume overloaded in the
setting of AS. She then developed hypoxia, initially with poor
sats on facemask. She was not intubated. CXR was notable for RLL
collapse presumed due to mucus plug as well as b/l pleural
effusions secondary to volume overload. She was initially
diuresed with a Lasix gtt with suboptimal effect, transitioned
to Lasix boluses (20mg IV) with good effect (last dose IV dose
was at 8:30am [**2188-7-5**]). At the time of transfer to medicine, she
was 2.5L negative through her LOS and had O2 sats of 94-95% on
4-5L O2.
.
On HD2 she flipped into AFib. It was thought that pulm edema
pushed her back in AFib, so she was bolused and started on po
amiodarone. Flipped back into Afib with RVR twice in SICU, each
time she was bolused with 150 IV Amio and transitioned back into
NS. At time of transfer to medicine was she was 2 days into 5
days of 400mg po amiodarone TID with PO diltiazem 45mg PO QID
per cards recs.
.
There was concern for initial concern for HAP due to initial
CXR. Received Cipro/Cefepime/Vanco for several days which were
stopped on [**7-6**] as probability of infection low. Patient has
been afebrile since admission. Chronic leukocytosis in 20s
thought secondary to underlying PMR and chronic steroid use.
Urine grew pseudomonas in her urine and got 1 dose of
ceftriaxone.
.
She received 1u PRBC's for Hct 35 because her baseline was felt
to be 40's.
.
There was concern about her pain control and concern for
splinting, so had an epidural catheter placed for pain control,
and pain service was following, using Dilaudid and Bupivicaine.
.
She had an NG in for feeding that was removed as she improved,
removed the day of transfer to medicine. PT has been consulted,
needs two person assist, has been OOB to chair qday.  Pain
Service following. Epidural catheter removed prior to transfer
to medicine.
.
Vitals at time of transfer: 98.2 137/55 76 16 93% face tent, 96%
on 3L NC. Per reports, no need further diuresis as patient is
-2.5L through LOS
.
On the medicine floor, pt had no complaints. Saturating well on
RA. Pt denies f/c/ns, difficulty breathing, CP, palpitations,
n/v, abd pain.

Admission CXR: 1. Left costophrenic angle blunting likely
represents consolidation or effusion.
2. No evidence of rib fractures; if clinical concern for rib
fracture,
dedicated rib series is recommended.

CT CAP [**2188-6-29**]: Extraperitoneal bladder rupture.
No evidence of solid organ injury. No evidence of active
extravasation however limited by presence of extraluminal
contrast from prior cystogram.
Right inferior and left superior pubic rami fractures with
minimal
displacement and small hematoma. Minimal mesenteric stranding in
the right abdomen can be seen in a setting of blunt trauma, CT
is not sensitive in delineation of bowel injury.

CT head [**2188-6-29**]: No acute intracranial process

[**6-29**] UCx with pan sensitive Pseudomonas 10-100k and 10-100k Strep

Echo [**2188-7-1**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Cystogram [**2188-7-9**]:  Persistent small anterolateral bladder leak,
correlating appropriately with the site of extraperitoneal
bladder rupture demonstrated on CT from [**2188-6-29**].

Brief Hospital Course:
ED Course: Patient presented to ED and after foley catheter
placement bright red blood was drained from the bladder.  The
patient required IVF resuscitation for hypotension.  Imaging was
performed. CT Torso showed extraperitoneal bladder rupture, as
well as R Inf and L Sup Pubic rami fx
Urology and orthopedic surgery were consulted. Orthopedic
surgery recommended non-operative managment of t
