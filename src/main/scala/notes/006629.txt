Chief Complaint:
fever.sob

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy, intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 55M with Mantle Cell Lymphoma , D+35 s/p an autologous
stem cell transplant. He was in his USOH until 2 days ago when
he developed worsening non-productive cough, SOB and low grade
fever. His Temp in the clinic yesterday was 100.5. Blood cxs
were taken and he was started on azithromycin and vancomycin.
Today he was worse and atovaquone was added to his abx. However
this evening he had a temp of 102 at home and he also was more
dyspneic even at rest and he went to the ED. Last week he had
diarrhea which improved after he was started on Lomotil. Last
week he was also noted to have transaminitis and his fluconazole
was held. He denies LE edema, chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting.


Past Medical History:
1.  Lipoid nephrosis at age 27, resolved with prednisone
2.  Lichen Planus, resolved after chemotherapy, no h/o Hep C
3.  Rectal fissures, resolved after sphincterotomy per pt
4.  Sciatica, resolved after exercises and stretches
.
Past Oncology History: He was diagnosed with mantle cell
lymphoma by
bone marrow biopsy [**10-12**] when he was found to have an elevated
white count on routine labs. His cytogenetics showed a 11:14
translocation. He has been treated with 3 cycles of hyperCVAD,
first two were complicated by volume overload and hyponatremia.
He has also received 2 doses of rituximab. His course was also
complicated by splenic laceration ([**2116-12-20**]) from splenomegally
secondary to neulasta and hyperleukocytosis. Underwent cycle 3A
of hyperCVAD (cytoxan, vincristine, adramycin, decadron) in
[**Month (only) 404**]. On [**2117-5-5**] underwent high dose cytoxan for stem cell
harvesting prior to his autologous stem cell transplantation.


Social History:
He continues to work managing a computer database at [**University/College 15978**]. He quit smoking 30 years ago, at which point he had

been smoking [**4-10**] ppd for 10 years. He drinks 1-2 drinks per
evening. Distant h/o MJ use. No IVDA. He lives with his wife,
no children, one dog.

Family History:
His mother had a precancerous condition of the breast which was
treated with bilateral mastectomy.  His father is well.  He has
no children and has one healthy brother.  There is no known
family history of blood disorders or actual cancers.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**7-15**]):
New diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings suggestive

of an atypical infection of viral etiology in this neutropenic
patient
.
CT chest on [**7-17**]: IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse bilateral consolidation of all lobes with relative
sparing of the
apices consistent with multifocal pneumonia or possibly ARDS.
2.  Moderate right and small left layering pleural effusions.
.
U/S abd ([**7-16**]):
Splenomegaly. Otherwise, unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o male on s/p autoSCT for mantle cell lymphoma who was
initially admitted with fever and hypoxemia with bilateral
infiltrates and effusions. The following events were addressed
during his admission.

1. Hypoxemia
On arrival to the floor, patient was sating about 90% on 4
liters. ABG was done that showed 7.47/34/38 on RA. A Ventury
mask was started and his oxygenation improved. X ray showed new
diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings suggestive of
an atypical infection of viral etiology. Patient was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics, TMP-SMX to cover PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] steroids.
Pulmonary was consulted who felt that the process was more
likely a viral or atypical pneumonia. In order to bronch him,
they felt that he would have to be intubate at that point and
after discussion with him and the family it was decided to defer
it. CT scan showed diffuse bilateral consolidation of all lobes
with relative sparing of the apices consistent with multifocal
pneumonia or possibly ARDS and moderate right and small left
layering pleural effusions. His respiratory status decompensated
and on [**7-18**] he had to be transferred to the ICU for intubation.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course [**7-18**] to [**7-22**]:
The pt was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for intubation after developing
progressive hypoxia, likely secondary to ARDS vs multifocal PNA.
His oxygen saturation prior to admission was 80% on 13L
ventimask and NC. The pt was sedated and intubated by
anesthesia. He underwent an A-line placement.  Pt had a
bronchoscopy that showed evidence of prior DAH, and patient was
initiated on high dose Solumedrol 100 mg IV bid.  An TTE with
bubble study was negative for any PFO or ASD that was causing
persistent hypoxemia despite adequate ventilation.  A CTA was
negative for any PE.  His daily CXR continued to be consistent
with ARDS of unknown etiology combined with DAH.  His BAL
cultures remained NGTD, and all other cx data remained negative.
 Patient was continued on Cefepime and Vanco for treatment of
his neutropenic fever, although no etiology to his fevers could
be found.  Eventually, patient's WBC count returned to [**Location 213**],
and his fevers resolved. He self-extubated himself on [**7-22**] and
was transitioned initially to BiPap and then to face mask as
tolerated.  He was eventually weaned down to 6L NC on transfer
to the [**Month/Year (2) 3242**] floor.  His steroid dose was quickly tapered down
given his immunocompromised state, and at time of transfer, was
on SoluMedrol 100mg IV daily. At that point he had completed a
10 day course of cefepime and vancomycin on [**2117-7-25**].

Night prior to transfer to the floor patient spiked fevers and
it was decided to continue with empiric antibiotic coverage. His
steroids were decreased upon transfer.
On the [**Date Range 3242**] floor, his respiratory status was tenous and his
fevers continued. His given ? of new infiltrates in x ray prior
to transfer a CT was ordered. It showed marked improvement of
consolidations and septal wall thickening in comparison to the
previous CT, but rapid worsening during the last three days in
comparison to the chest x-ray suggest pulmonary edema.
Infectious process should also be included in the Dx.

On [**2117-7-27**] he had an episode of low sats to 88% and increase
shortness of breath. Chest X ray showed worsening bilateral
pulmonary opacities with progression to frank alveolar
consolidation. Report suggested recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage
or pulmonary edema. He was given lasix however his respiratory
status did not improved much. Echocardiogram was also done that
showed no change LVEF >55%, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Basically unchanged from prior. Given his persistent fevers and
unclear etiology of pulmonary infiltrates pulmonary was
re-consulted and Infectious disease service. Given lack of clear
of positive data from Blood cx, urine cx and BAL, it was decided
to continue treating empirically for CAP, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] Diffuse
Alveolar Hemorrhage. Patient was continued on Cefepime,
Vancomycin, Clindamycin and primaquine were added for PCP
coverage, AmBisome, and steroid dose was increased.
Next day X ray was checked and showed marked improvement,
however o2 requirement still present with sats 92-94% on
40%FIO2. Given this rapid changes on x ray infiltrates, ID and
pulmonary feel at this point that is less likely to be
infectious. Despite being on broad antibiotic coverage, his
