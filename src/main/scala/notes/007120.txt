Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p [**Company 1543**] Revo RVDR01 dual chamber pacer placement


History of Present Illness:
56F with history of Hodgkins lymphoma s/p XRT in [**2096**], BrCA s/p
masectomy and Chemo in [**4-/2140**], and AVR with BP valve in [**2123-8-3**]
and ongoing work up for DOE of unclear etiology presenting to
the [**Name (NI) **] with cc of syncopal event last night. She was sitting on
the couch when she developed tunnel vision, became lightheaded
and lost consciousness for about 10 seconds the son describes
contraction of her right and right leg. She awoke immediately
after and was herself without a postictal period. No fall or
trauma. Denies fever headache nausea vomiting chest pain
shortness of breath or pain in her neck arm back or jaw.

In the ED she had a 36 second episode of complete heart block
with no escape beats that was symptomatic. She convierted
spontaneously and a temp wire was placed in the ED. She is
admitted to the CCU for monitoring and will need pacer placement
tomorrow AM. Threshold was sset at 0.8 and the length of the
catheter is 37 cm.

Of note she was recently admitted for elective diagnostic cath
for worsenign DOE of unclear etiology. The cath showed mild
mitral stenosis and LV RV equalization of pressures that was not
felt to be indicative of a restrictive process

IMAGING:
CXR  [**2130-6-15**] post-PPM placement:
Right transvenous pacemaker leads terminate in standard position
in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Cardiac size is top
normal.  The lungs are clear. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.  There is kyphosis and decrease in height of a
mid thoracic vertebral body.  Sternal wires are aligned.  The
patient is status post valve replacement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old female with history of aortic valve
repair (AVR), Chest radition and Chemo who presented for
syncopal work up and was found to have 36 second asystole pause
with complete heart block.  She underwent placement of permanent
pacemaker.
.
# Complete heart block: Patient with confirmed heart block on
telemetry.  Appeared from the tele strip that there was a PVC
infranodally which triggered the episode. Likely etiology was
felt to be scaring from chemotherapy or XRT.  Her beta blockers
were held while awaiting pacemaker placement.  Had successful
placement of pacer on [**2130-6-14**] and post-op course was
uncomplicated.  Should follow up in device clinic and with
cardiology.  After pacer placed, did not have further
arrhythmias and heart rate remained controlled in the 70s-90s so
her metoprolol was not restarted.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Baseline Cr 1.1 and was 1.4-1.5 on
admission.  Likely secondary to poor forward flow in setting of
pulselessness.  Will have repeat labs on follow-up and expect
resolution.  Held her lisinopril until follow-up creatinine is
checked (was not hypertensive during admission).
.
# Hypertension (HTN): Was not hypertensive during admission even
when metoprolol and lisinopril were held for reasons above.
Thus, discontinued both metoprolol and lisinopril.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Hyperlipidemia (HLD)- Continued simvastatin
# Hypothyroidism: Continued synthroid
# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): continued
inhalers
# Diabetes mellitus (DM): Sliding scale insulin in house,
restarted metformin at discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Follow up device clinic
- Please trend creatinine on follow-up and consider further work
up for kdney injry if not returned to baseline (Cr 1.1 at
baseline)

Discharge Instructions:
You had complete heart block and passed out at home. The EP team
reviewed your strips and placed a temporary wire, then a
permanant pacemaker, the make and model is listed below. You
have recovered well. Your creatinine increased to 1.5 after the
procedure, it is thought that you were slightly dehydrated and
received a fluid bolus. Your repeat creatinine is 1.5 and you
will have it checked as an outpatient. Please get your
creatinine checked on [**6-20**] when you see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23239**]. A
prescription has been written for you to take to his office.
