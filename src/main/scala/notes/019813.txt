History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 69-year-old gentleman with a PMH significant for
cryptogenic cirrhosis admitted for BRBPR, ARF, and ECG changes.
The patient initially presented to the OSH ED from his nursing
home for generalized weakness.  At the OSH, he received narcan
with good response.  He was then noted to have a hct of 32.1
with associated melenic stools.  At that time, ECG demosntrating
x mm STE in the inferolateral leads. The patient received 2
units PRBC, 1 unit FFP, 1L IVF, and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 97.2 110 117/63 18 98%2L NC. He was
noted to have gross blood in the rectal vault, and labs notable
for a hct of 33.9, creatinine of 4.5 from 1.6, and a TnT of 0.2
without CK unchanged.  Liver was consulted, and NGL demonstrated
gastric contents without gross blood or coffee grounds.
Cardiology was faxed the ECG, and the STE were [**Last Name (un) **] to be stable
and representign demand ischemia. The patient was transfused an
additional 2 units FFP, started on a PPI gtt and octreotide gtt,
had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 109**] and was then admitted to the MICU for further
management.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under
Neurosurgery from [**Date range (1) 60917**] for shoulder pain felt by
Neurosurgery and Orthopedics to be due to DJD, with his hospital
course complicated by a UTI speciated as MRSA with treatment
plan of 7d ciprofloxacin.  On the day of discharge, the
patient's creatinine was found to be 1.6 from 1.1-1.2 prior.

TTE ([**4-21**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. No
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. In supine position, there
is little fluid around the apex and lateral LV, but ~2 cm
posterior to the right atrium. There is very brief right atrial
diastolic collapse without any echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild
symmetric LVH with vigorous biventricular systolic function.
Pericardial effusion as described above.

CT Chest:
1. Bilateral basal lung consolidation / atelectasis.
2. Cirrhotic macronodular liver with sequelae of portal
hypertension with
extensive splenic collaterals with splenorenal shunt and
splenomegaly. No
evidence for ascites.
3. No evidence for intra-abdominal free fluid, collection or
abscess.
4. Scattered diverticula of the sigmoid colon without evidence
for acute
diverticulitis.
5. Incompletely characterized left lower pole hypodense lesion.
Renal US
advised to compare with prior from [**2163-4-19**] as a renal
abscess cannot be fully excluded.
6. Non-obstructing 3mm left renal calculus

CTH:  No acute intracranial pathology.

Abdominal U/S:
1. Limited examination demonstrating patency of the portal vein,
with
hepatofugal flow.
2. Marked splenomegaly..
3. Gallbladder sludge.
4. Limited evaluation of the kidneys but no evidence of
hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 3501**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] a 69 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
cryptogenic cirrhosis admitted for BRBPR with hospital course
complicated by acute renal failure, high grade MRSA bacteremia,
and respiratory failure requiring intubation.

1. Bradycardic PEA arrest: Patient had witnessed bradycardic PEA
arrest with RN at the bedside. CPR and first round of
epinephrine given immediately, and PEA cardiac arrest algorythmn
performed with multiple rounds of epinephrine, atropine, bicarb,
insulin/D50, and calcium administered. ABG during cardiac arrest
7.49/48/60, K 4.5, hct 25. Pericardiocentesis attempted with <5
mL blood returned. Patient expired at 9:05 pm on [**2163-4-24**].
Attending, PCP made aware. Family notified and declined
post-mortem exam.

2. Acute renal failure: Felt to be due to ATN given numerous
muddy brown casts.  Renal ultrasound did not show any vascular
lesions or hydronephrosis.  The patient was followed by Renal
during his hospitalization, and HD was attempted on [**4-23**] but
aborted in setting of hypotension.  Urine output initially fluid
responsive, but patient became increasingly anuric during his
hospital course.

3. MRSA bacteremia: Patient noted to have MRSA on urine culture
from Neurosurgery admission 1 week prior. He was subsequently
found to have a high grade MRSA bacteremia with MRSA or GPC in
clusters isolated in sputum, urine, and joint arthrocentesis.
Patient was followed by ID and plastic surgery for wrist tap.
He was treated with vancomycin, dosed by level. He had a TTE
during his admission that did not demonstrate any vegetations,
but did demonstrate a moderate sized pericardial effusion with
posterior assymetry.  CTH, CT neck, and CT torso failed to
isolate a fluid collection or abscess.

4. Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated during ICU course
given increased work of breathing and pulmonary edema in setting
of renal failure.

5. GIB: While GI bleed was initially impetus for ICU admission,
patient did not have active GI bleeding during admission.

6. Cirrhosis: Due to unclear etiology. Hepatology followed
during admission.

Medications on Admission:
Allopurinol 100 mg daily
Hydralazine 25 mg
