Service:  [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine Firm

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
female with a history of tracheal stenosis, ? asthma,
gastroesophageal reflux disease status post Nissen
fundoplication transferred from an outside hospital with
acute shortness of breath.

Patient was in her usual state of health until six days prior
to admission when she presented to the outside hospital with
a history of [**3-21**] days of shortness of breath, weakness, ?
fever, cough.  She was placed on CPAP plus BiPAP with
increased work of breathing; ABG showed pH of 7.30, pCO2 of
48, and pO2 of 288 on 100% O2.  She was eventually intubated
and started on dexamethasone 20 mg IV q.8h. and started on
levofloxacin for possible infection.

Had a bronchoscopy performed and a tracheal dilatation five
days prior to admission.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for possible tracheal stenting on
[**2113-12-25**].

MICU COURSE:  She was continued on the dexamethasone and on
ventilation.  She was extubated on hospital day #2.  She
finished her seven day course of ciprofloxacin for presumed
pneumonia, although afebrile and no chest x-ray findings on
outside hospital.  She was afebrile upon transfer.  She has
been bradycardic since intubation.  EKG showed Q-T
prolongation.  Baseline is normally in the 70s.

Cardiology was consulted and had no recommendations.  She was
ruled out for myocardial infarction on cardiac enzymes x3.
She was continued on her Fentanyl patch for pain control for
her low back pain.  Patient received tube feeds while
intubated.  She is tolerating p.o. upon transfer.

She is transferred to the [**Doctor Last Name **] Medicine Firm in stable
condition.  At present, she complains of low back pain,
stating that the Fentanyl patch is not working and
constipation.  She currently denies any fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, abdominal pain,
hematemesis, hematochezia, melena, dysuria, or seizures.  Has
ambulated and is tolerating p.o. well.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  In general, she is an
obese female, sitting in a chair, complaining of low back
pain in no apparent distress, avoids eye contact.  [**Name (NI) **] vitals
were a temperature of 97.1, pulse of 41 beats per minute and
regular, blood pressure of 100/palp, and a respiratory rate
of 20.  Her O2 saturation was 98% on room air.  She is
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Her pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
are intact.  Red reflex is present.  Anicteric sclerae.
Oropharynx is clear with moist mucous membranes.  Her neck
was supple with no nodules, lymphadenopathy, or tenderness.
Trachea was midline.  No JVD.  Carotid pulses were 2+ with no
bruits.  Thyroid was not palpable.  Tracheostomy scar was
well healed.  Right internal jugular line in place, no
discharge.  Her lungs showed good air movement and clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezes or rhonchi were noted.
Lateral thoracotomy scar well healed.  Her heart was sinus
bradycardic with regular rhythm.  Normal S1, S2.  No murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen was protuberant, soft, nontender,
and nondistended.  Bowel sounds were normoactive and with no
bruits noted.  Belly was intact to percussion with no masses
or ascites noted.  Liver edge was not palpable.  Spleen tip
was not palpable.  No costovertebral angle tenderness.  She
had a Foley in place, draining yellow urine.  No hematuria.
Extremities were warm with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
She had 2+ pedal pulses.  Skin showed no jaundice or rashes.
Patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.
Patient made poor eye contact during the interview.  Cranial
nerves II through XII are intact.  She had normal tone
throughout the whole body.  Strength 5/5 throughout the whole
body.  No pronator drift.  She had 1+ deep tendon reflexes at
the knees and the ankles.  Sensation was intact to vibration
and proprioception bilaterally.  She had normal
finger-to-nose testing.  Her gait was normal and she had a

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  Her white count was 11.6,
hematocrit of 36.5, platelets of 309.  Sodium of 138,
potassium of 3.9, chloride of 99, bicarb of 30, BUN 19,
creatinine 0.6, glucose of 110.  Calcium 8.9, phosphate 4.5,
magnesium 2.2.

EKG shows sinus bradycardia with Q-T prolongation.

Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 55% with normal
ventricular function.

CT of the trachea showed mild narrowing of the upper trachea
(50 mm in the anteroposterior measurement).  No changes with
breathing.  No nodules, consolidation, or interstitial lung
disease, no lytic or sclerotic bone lesions were noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Tracheal stenosis:  Patient was made NPO on the day of
transfer for bronchoscopy the following morning.  However,
video straboscopy was performed prior to the bronchoscopy.
In the past, she had been seen by the Speech and Swallow
services for paradoxical vocal cord function, which was
diagnosed at the time as functional muscle tension aphonia.

On video straboscopy during this admission, she was found to
have left vocal cord paralysis with bilateral posterior
glottic granulomas and polypoid changes on the medial edge of
the right true vocal cord, including changes secondary to
gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Speech and Swallow team recommended that aggressive reflux
management and voice treatment as outpatient and an ENT
followup for her left vocal cord paralysis.  Interventional
Pulmonary team cancelled the bronchoscopy secondary to these
results.

Interventional Pulmonology discussed her case in the
Multidisciplinary Airway Conference the night prior to
discharge.  The consensus was that she was probably having
laryngospasms made worse by her left true vocal cord
paralyses.  No tracheal surgery was deemed indicated at this
time (no tracheal pathology identified).  Interventional
Pulmonology suggested continuation of her proton-pump
inhibitor with antireflux medications and a follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17680**] (ENT) with outpatient speech therapy.  Etiology of
VC paralysis and inflammatory changes were either related to
recent intubation or prior surgery, with exacerbation by GERD.
It was unclear if her tracheomalacia contributed to exertional
dyspnea, but it was felt that her airway was safe and that
further evaluation could be completed as an outpatient in the
Pulmonary Service.

2. Bradycardia:  New onset identified on EKG after
intubation.  Cardiology evaluated, thought likely
neurological (enhanced vagal tone) etiology given no cardiac
history, normal thyroid functions, and normal electrolytes.
Patient was ruled out from a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes x3. She was followed clinically, and she was asymptomatic
throughout the hospitalization.
