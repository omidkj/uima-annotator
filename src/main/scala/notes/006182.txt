Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77yo F with history of numerous recent
hospitalizations for aspiration pneumonia events presents with
hypoxia at her rehabiilitation center.  Per nursing home/rehab
reports, she had been on a [**5-11**] day steady decline of respiratory

pneumonia coverage and lorazepam for anxiety. CXR showed
bilateral infiltrates. Patient was admitted to medicine for
further workup. Vitals prior to transfer 98.0 aux (100 rectal),
93SR, 108/52, 23, 95 6L.
.
On the floor, she reported difficultly breathing and believes
she choked on some food but is not sure. She has a productive
cough. She denies current SOB, chest pain, fevers or chills.  As
per records, she had recently been on levaquin since [**7-23**]. She
has also received increasing doses of benzodiazepines for last
week. Pt is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, who notes that she does still eat, however
does get supplementation with TF. On ROS, also notes recent 30

CXR [**2145-7-27**]
IMPRESSION: Hazy opacities in both lungs, which could represent
pulmonary
edema, but a superimposed infectious process is not excluded,
particularly
given the more focal opacities within the right upper lobe and
left lung base. Moderate-sized right pleural effusion. Given the
limited nature of the study, consider a followup PA and lateral
view when the patient is more cooperative.

CTA [**2144-7-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Confluent consolidation predominantly within the lung bases,
right greater
than left. in the right middle lobe and posterior segment of the
right upper
lobe . Findings are consistent with aspiration pneumonia and
large
atelectasis as described above.
3. Healed right anterior third rib fracture and sclerotic left
eighth and
ninth ribs, likely secondary to prior trauma.

CXR [**2145-7-31**]:
FINDINGS: Again seen is opacity obscuring the right
hemidiaphragm and right
heart border consistent with the known right lower lobe and
middle lobe
consolidation. Patchy areas of increased opacity in the right
upper lung and
left lower lung as well that are similar in appearance compared
to prior.

CT Head Noncontrast [**2145-8-5**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR [**2145-8-6**]:
The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction. There is
slightly
improved atelectasis of the right lower lobe, but there is still
present
pulmonary edema, asymmetric, right more than left associated
with bilateral
pleural effusions and with bibasilar atelectasis. Old fractures
of the left
humerus as well as vertebroplasty and percutaneous gastrostomy
are
demonstrated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary reason for hospitalization:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 77yo F with history of numerous recent
hospitalizations for aspiration events who presented with
hypoxia at rehab, found to have pneumonia.

Active Diagnoses:
# Pneumonia: Likely due to aspiration event. CXR shows bilateral
infiltrates and diffuse rhonchi on exam. Given her recent
residence in a nursing home, treat for HCAP and aspiration with
Vanc/cefepime/metronidazole.  Patient initially maintained
oxygen saturation around low 90s on 5-6L, but on HD3 triggered
for hypoxia to low 80s unresolved with nebulizers.  She was
given oxygen by non-rebreather, diuresed and given chest
physical therapy, and sent to the ICU.  In the ICU, she was
given high flow oxygen and her antibiotics were continued.  She
was transferred back to the floor, where she has maintained O2
sats in the mid-90s on 5L.  Pulmonary exam was much improved by
discharge, but still showed R>L crackles/rhonchi 2/3 up both
lung fields.  She will need to complete 6 more days of
vancomycin, cefepime and flagyl after discharge.

# Dysphagia.  Patient has decreased oropharyneal muscle tone and
trouble swallowing, causing her to aspirate.  She has a g-tube
in place, which provides nutrition in the absence of swallowing,
but does not prevent aspiration.  On a previous admission, she
failed speech and swallow study.  Neurology tea
