Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Carboplatin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization on [**4-26**] showing clean coronaries


History of Present Illness:
74yo F with stage IV lung CA complicated by recurrent pleural
effusions who was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on
[**2196-4-15**] with progressive shortness of breath and LLL pneumonia.
On [**2196-4-16**], she developed chest pain and anteroseptal ST
elevation. Troponon peaked at 4.5. Treated conservatively with
IV heparin, aspirin, plavix, beta blockers. She has had
recurrent episodes x 2 since then, one episode of flash
pulmonary edema, and another episode of chest pain and CHF
yesterday. Echo showed LVEF 35%, and anteroseptal wall motion
abnormalities. Diursed 4000 cc's yesterday after 20mg IV Lasix.
Due to recurrent episodes of chest pain, patient was transferred
for cath.
.
Upon transfer, she was reported to be afebrile on antibiotics
and was able to lie flat. Pleurx catheter draining minimal
fluid. She is still having chest discomfort which she describes
as pressure. She denies any change in breath with cough. Her
pain has not improved with nitro gtt. Recent ECG reported as Q
waves across precordium.
.
Vitals on transfer were T 98.2, HR 74, BP 119/68, RR 18, 94% on
4L NC
.
On arrival to the floor, patient continues to have chest
pressure. She denies change in intensity with cough.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, she endorses chronic cough that is
occasionally productive of yellow sputum. She is SOB
chronically. She endorses "choking" which is a chronic issue.
She denies N/V/D, but endorses sons[**Name (NI) **]. She has leg pain
which is chronic, related to disc disease. Otherwise, ROS
negative except as noted above.

Vitals on discharge: SBP ranging 99-122 for at least several
days, pulses 80's to low 100's. 99% 2L to 100% on 3L
Her initially very rhonchorous breath sounds cleared up by day 2
of hospitalization; clear without crackles but with only poor to
fair air movement, heart RRR, no BLE edema.


Pertinent Results:

IMPRESSION: Findings in the upper right chest likely
representing
postsurgical change. A mass-like density is projected within an
air cavity in the upper right chest. Its relationship to the
cavity and underlying lung parenchyma is unclear in one
projection. There is additional streaky density consistent with
fibrotic scarring and subsegmental atelectasis. Prominent
interstitial markings are likely chronic. There is no definite
focal consolidation. Blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus is
consistent with pleural thickening and/or fluid. Comparison with
previous chest x-rays or further evaluation with CT is
recommended.
.
[**2196-4-25**] echo
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the mid anterior septum. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 55-60 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction but preserved global ejection
fraction. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Assessment & Recommendations
1.	Medical Management
2.	Discontinue Clopidogrel


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt's course is complicated as she has received care at several
hospitals ([**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 46**]) and documentation was not fully
provided on transfer here, but in brief:

74yoF with stage IV metastatic (to liver) NSCLC including
recurrent effusions requring Pleurex catheter transfered from
OSH where she had an anterior STEMI [**2196-4-16**] which was medically
treated for a week (? given poor prognosis from metastatic lung
ca) who was transferred for evaluation for cardiac cath given
ongoing chest pain.

1. Acute STEMI: Likely had an acute LAD occlusion given
distibution of STE on ECG at the time of event. Pt medically
managed at OSH. On arrival, pt was treated with ACS protocol
including BB, ASA, Plavix, Heparin gtt, Nitro gtt.

She continued to have chest tightness through her course which
was ? multifactorial but possibly from continued cardiac
ischemia without further enzyme leak or worsening on EKG. She
eventually went to cath which was surprisingly without any
angiographically apparent disease. Therefore, Heparin gtt,
statin, and Plavix were discontinued and pt should continue on
ASA and BB only, and could consider adding ACEi if bp/Cr
tolerate. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on captopril, which was
d/ced during her admission and not resumed. However, given
prognosis, it is quite reasonable to down-titrate the number of
meds she needs and leave ACEi off.

By the time of discharge, pt had been free of chest tightness
for several days.

Of note, she received an echo which showed EF 55-60%, normal
[**Doctor Last Name 1754**], 1+ MR, mild PA sHTN, and focal hypokinesis of mid
anterior septum consistent with ACS territory.

2. Brief episode of hypoxia: On admission, pt with normal O2
sats on 4-5L NC however day after admission had acute hypoxia,
to mid 80s on 5L, during which she was also having chest
tightness. She was transitioned to a NRB with improvement in
oxygenation to normal. Nitro was up-titrated, but pain was
ultimately re
