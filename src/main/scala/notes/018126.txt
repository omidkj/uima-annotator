HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old Russian
speaking female a history of chronic renal insufficiency,
type 2 diabetes, obesity, presenting with a 7 pound weight
gain, increase in BUN and creatinine, BUN 157, creatinine 3.5
from her baseline creatinine bearing between [**2-22**], a
bicarbonate of 13, and an acidemia with a pH of 7.1, pCO2 40,
pO2 114.  The patient was noted to be hypothermic to 94.3 F,
hypotensive in the Emergency Department with a blood pressure
of 94/40.

Patient received approximately 2 liters of normal saline in
the ED, 1 liter of Lactated Ringers and 1 liter of D5 with
bicarbonate.  CT of the abdomen was remarkable for 4.5 x 2.3
cm Staghorn calculus in the right renal collecting system.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, however, the kidneys
were atrophic bilaterally.  Chest x-ray was unrevealing.
Patient was initially transferred to the MICU and entered in
the MUST protocol.  She was empirically treated with
Levaquin, however, there was no clear source of infection.

In the MICU, the working diagnosis was prerenal azotemia
versus ATN.  Patient did receive aggressive IV fluid
hydration, bicarbonate with improvement in her renal function
and overall urine output.  The Renal service was following
the patient while in the MICU, and felt that there was no
indication for dialysis.

Upon transfer to the floor, the patient was feeling well,
denying any acute complaints.  She was tolerating p.o.,
breathing comfortably, and hemodynamically stable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or drug abuse.  Denies smoking
history.  Is a retired music teacher.

PHYSICAL EXAM FROM ADMISSION:  Temperature 94.3, heart rate
60, blood pressure 94/40, respiratory rate 12, and 96% on
room air.  Generally, the patient is an alert, oriented,
obese female.  HEENT was notable for dry mucous membranes.
Cardiac examination unremarkable.  Lung exam normal.
Abdominal examination normal.  Extremity examination:  2+
pitting edema up to the thighs bilaterally.  No CVA
tenderness.  No asterixis.  Her left foot was wrapped status
post the TMA surgery in [**2184-10-20**].  There is no
evidence of infection upon changing of the dressing.

LABORATORY STUDIES FROM ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
6.3, hematocrit 30.8, platelets 230.  INR 2.4.  Sodium 131,
BUN 157, creatinine 3.5, bicarbonate 13, calcium 7,
phosphorus 12.7, anion gap 19, calcium/phosphorus product
88.9.  LFTs within normal limits.  Urinalysis notable for
moderate blood, 500 protein, negative nitrites, glucose and
ketones, small leukocyte esterase.

ABG:  pH 7.12, pCO2 40, pO2 114, lactate 0.6.

CT of the pelvis:  4.5 x 2.3 cm Staghorn calculus in right
renal collecting system, no hydronephrosis.  Bilateral
atrophic kidneys.  Multiple gallstones within the gallbladder
without any evidence of inflammation.

Chest x-ray:  No effusions or infiltrates.

Renal ultrasound from the [**11-4**]:  Right kidney
measuring 9.8 cm, left kidney 12.9 cm, multiple cysts in the
right kidney one with septations.

EKG:  A-V paced.  Previous EKG A-V paced with fusion beats.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. Renal:  Renal consult followed the patient while in-house.
The patient's creatinine and BUN improved dramatically post
IV fluid hydration likely secondary to prerenal azotemia
versus ATN.  However, there was no evidence of an inciting
infection or medications which could have caused ATN.
Patient was intermittently hypotensive, therefore possible
hypoperfusion may have been the cause.

Other possibilities included patient's longstanding history
of diabetes as well as hypertension.  Patient's acidemia
resolved, and she did not need any further repletion of
bicarbonate during her hospital course.

2. Hypotension:  Patient's hypotension resolved post IV fluid
hydration.  Antihypertensive regimen was restarted gently
upon discharge.  Nephrotoxic agents such as
hydrochlorothiazide was held in the interim.

3. Infectious disease:  There was no evidence of sepsis,
although the patient was intermittently hypotensive upon
presentation as well as hypothermic.  Both of these had
resolved upon transfer to the floor.  Cultures were negative.
Patient was treated empirically with levofloxacin for
presumed UTI.

4. Cardiac:  Patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction on
presentation.  She was maintained on aspirin, statin, and
beta blocker.

Pump:  Repeat echocardiogram was unchanged.  IV fluids were
held while patient was transferred to the floor, however, in
the MICU the patient received several liters of IV fluids.

Rhythm:  Patient was A-V paced.  Coumadin was restarted.
Patient's INR was therapeutic.

5. GI/Heme:  Patient received total 1 unit of packed red
blood cells.  There is no evidence of an acute bleed.
Thought this may have been related to hemodilution versus
renal failure.  Her hematocrit responded appropriately, and
patient was maintained on a proton-pump inhibitor.

6. Type 2 diabetes:  Patient was maintained on Glipizide,
Humalog sliding scale.  Her left foot wound was
postoperatively checked without any evidence of infection.
Vascular Surgery staff were consulted to evaluate the
patient's wound to ensure proper healing.

7. Code status:  The patient was confirmed to be a full code
during this hospitalization.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute renal failure secondary to acute tubular necrosis.
2. Chronic renal insufficiency.
3. Atrial fibrillation status post biventricular pacer.
4. Hypertension.
5. Hypercholesterolemia.
6. Peptic ulcer disease.
7. Anemia.
8. Status post left transmetatarsal amputation in [**2184-9-20**].
9. Type 2 diabetes.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  The patient is instructed to followup
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] within one month of
discharge.

MAJOR SURGICAL OR INVASIVE PROCEDURES PERFORMED DURING THIS
HOSPITALIZATION:  Patient had a central venous line placed in
the MICU, which was discontinued upon discharge.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Patient is going to go home with
Physical Therapy.
