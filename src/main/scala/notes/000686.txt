Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is 77 yo M with a PMH of IPF on 6L O2 at home, severe
pulmonary artery hypertension, CAD s/p 4 vessel CABG [**2140**] with
PCI [**2159**], DM who was initially admitted [**2162-3-12**] from [**Hospital1 3325**] for chest pain and worsening SOB. On arrival to the
outside hospital, his O2 sats were in the low-80's on his 4L,
and he was thought to be in CHF. Troponin I at [**Hospital1 46**] was mildly
positive at 0.13, his hematocrit was 24, and his EKG showed a
RBBB. His chest pressure resolved with ASA and nitro SL. He was
started on 100%[**Hospital1 597**] and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In our ED, he was given IV Lasix 80 mg IV x1 with 1.6 L UO.  He
was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service for elevated
troponin T of 0.05 and CHF.  On [**3-12**], the patient was noted
to become tachycardic with HR in 120s-140s and sats of 60% on 6L
NC-->100% on [**Name (NI) 597**] (pt was though to be mouth breathing).  As
there was concern for PE given he acute nature of the event, the
patient was started on heparin and transferred to the MICU for
further care.
.
The patient at this time feels SOB but does not feels any more
SOB than he has over the past several days.  He denies any
current chest pain.  He does complain of some RLE cramping that
he relates to diuresis.  He denies any abdominal pain.  He
admits to coughing up blood-tinged sputum over the past several
months.  His Plavix was stopped 2 weeks prior to admission in
the setting of this hemoptysis.  He admits also to orthopnea,
PND, and DOE. In addition, the patient notes he has become more
SOB than usual starting this past [**Month (only) **].  He was diagnosed with
IPF one month ago, and prior had carried a diagnosis only of
COPD.

Physical Exam:
Admission to Hospital:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Blood pressure was 136/66 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 105
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/min.
Oxygen saturation was 89-99% on 100% [**Hospital3 597**].
.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were not inappropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVD to the angle of the jaw. The carotid waveform was normal.
There was no thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities,
scoliosis or kyphosis. The respirations were labored and there
was occasional use of accessory muscles. There were coarse
crackles at the bases and [**12-23**] the way up bilaterally.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart rate was tachycardic. The
heart sounds revealed a normal S1 and S2. There were no
appreciable rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor or cyanosis.
Clubbing of the upper extremities was present. There was 1+
pitting edema to the knees bilaterally. There were no abdominal,
femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin
and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers,
scars, or xanthomas.

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**2162-3-12**]: ECG Study Date of [**2162-3-12**]  12:10:24 PM
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Incomplete right
bundle-branch block pattern. Probable prior inferior wall
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2162-2-20**] right precordial ST-T wave changes are less apparent and
the rate is faster.

CT Chest [**2162-3-13**] 2:55 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe, diffuse fibrosis and emphysema throughout the lungs,
with marked interval worsening of the fibrosis compared to prior
study of [**2162-2-17**]. Findings compatible with known idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema.
2. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Extensive coronary artery calcifications in a patient with
prior CABG surgery.
4. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Findings suggestive of
pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: 77 yo M with a PMH of IPF on 6L O2 at home,
severe pulmonary artery hypertension, CAD s/p 4 vessel CABG [**2140**]
with PCI [**2159**], DM, admitted for dyspnea and transferred to the
MICU for hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Distress:  Initial ddx includes CHF, PNA,
MI, PE and worsening pulmonary fibrosis.  CTA of chest was
obtained - negative for PE but showed rapid progression of
pulmonary fibrosis.  Not felt likely to be due to cardiac
ischemia, as CKMBI was negative and Tn were stable, though
mildly elevated at 0.03-0.05. Initially was treated empirically
with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for possible CAP complicating
underlying lung disease.  Additionally started on high dose
steroids for IPF.  Despite antibiotic treatment and steroids,
dyspnea persisted without improvement.  Mr. [**Known lastname 42307**] also was
diuresed in the ED without improvement in respiratory status.
.
Respiratory distress is likely secondary to acute and rapid
worsening of IPF that is not steroid responsive.  After
discussions with the Mr. [**Known lastname 42307**] and his family, he [**Known lastname 28092**] to
discontinue aggressive treatment and [**Known lastname 28092**] for hospice care at
home.  Supportive care includes supplemental oxygen,
anti-tussives and morphine/codeine prn.
.
Chest Pressure: had chest pressure with coughing spasm which
resolved spontaneously.  Likely musculoskeletal, though could
also be secondary to demand ischemia, as patient desturated to
75% during coughing spasm.  EKG was unchanged from prior and
cardiac enzymes were unchanged x 2.
.
# ID: Pt was initially febrile and was treated empirically for
possible pneumonia.  CTA was negative for PE.  There was no
improvement in respiratory status with antibiotic treatment;
antibiotics were discontinued on [**3-16**] after Mr. [**Known lastname 42307**] [**Last Name (Titles) 28092**]
to transition to hospice care.
.

Mr. [**Known lastname 42307**] was discharged to home on [**2162-3-17**] with home hospice
services.
