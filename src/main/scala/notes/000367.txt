Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for STEs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female who is transferred from
[**Hospital **] hospital with concern for STEMI.
.
She had an unwitnessed fall and was found at the bottom of the
stairs. She last spoke with her son yesterday at noon and this
morning her visiting nurse came and found her down. She was
confused after the fall and has been unable to provide a clear
story around the time of the fall. She was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**]
hospital where there was concern for a C4 fracture as well as
STEMI with elevated troponins.
.
In the ED she was CP free, EKG showed STEs in V3 and V4, and was
started on Heparin gtt. A CT Torso did not show any acute
injuries. CT Cspine did not show a definite fracture and her
c-spine was cleared by ortho. Cardiology was consulted in the ED
who recommended admission to CCU and discontinuing Heparin gtt
as suspicion for STEMI was low.
.
In the CCU she is A&Ox0 with likely baseline dementia. On
discussion with her son, she does not have documented dementia
but has not left her house in over a year because she gets lost
and confused, has people come to her house to cut her hair and
her nails, but is apparently up and about without issues while
within her home. She is unable to provide any history but does
deny CP, neck/jaw pain, epigastric pain, n/v, and SOB.
.
The pt is unable to provide any ROS.

Micro/Path:
.
Urine Culture [**12-22**]: Pan-sensitive E. coli
Urine Culture [**12-23**]: < 10,000 organisms
Blood Cultures x 2 [**12-22**]: NGTD
Blood Cultures x 2 [**12-24**]: NGTD
.
Imaging/Studies:
CT Torso [**12-22**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe which is
nonspecific but may represent contusion in setting of trauma vs
infection. If clinically relevant given patient age, recommend
follow-up to resolution to exclude underlying lesion.
2. Markedly distended bladder. Consider Foley catheter placement
if not
already completed.
3. Hypodense lesion within the upper pole of the right kidney,
likely a cyst.
4. Paget's disease of the pelvis and the right femur.
5. Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta.
.
CXR Portable [**12-22**]:
FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: No focal opacity to suggest pneumonia
is seen.
There may be mild edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
identified.
There is moderate cardiomegaly. Calcifications of the aortic
arch are
present. No displaced fracture is identified.
.
CXR Portable [**12-24**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Improved aeration, particularly in the right upper lobe.
2. No evidence of pneumonia.
3. Radiographic evidence of COPD.
4. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
ECHO [**12-24**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
septal and apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with mild
systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with hx of HTN, HLD, COPD (diagnosed by our CT scan), and
likely severe baseline dementia transferred from OSH for concern
of ACS after being found down.
.
# Hyperactive Delerium and Severe Dementia: During this
admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 60680**] had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
with agitation. She was oftentimes found speaking to herself for
hours on end with poor sleep and agitation. Per report of the
family, she was also noted to have poor baseline functioning
without having left her house for years and not being able to
perform ADL's c/w severe dementia. It was felt that she was
likely delirious from a new environment, UTI which was
effectively treated, tethers, lack of sleep, and her baseline
poor vision (due to macular degeneration). She did not respond
well to redirection or small doses PO zydis but responded
somewhat to small doses of subQ haldol in the CCU, but responded
slightly to 0.25 risperidone [**Hospital1 **]. She had negative CT head,
non-focal neuro exam. She was followed by [**Female First Name (un) **] psych while
in-house. She was determined to be medically unsafe to live at
home by herself and was screened for placement in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-psych
facility.
.
# E. Coli UTI: She had a positive UA on admission and was
started on IV ceftriaxone in the ED. Urine cultures grew
pan-sensitive e. coli which cleared on repeat culture and blood
cultures were NGTD. She was not febrile or HD unstable at any
point and finished a 3 day course of IV ceftriaxone.
.
# Syncope Workup: Pt was found at the base of stairs al
