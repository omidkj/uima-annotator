HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 52-year-old female
with known aortic stenosis, who has been experiencing
dizziness for the past two months.  She has also complained
of substernal burning with exercise, which occurs 1-2x a
month over the last 3-4 months.  Echocardiogram [**2176-6-13**]
showed moderate left atrial dilatation, moderate left
ventricular hypertrophy, and left ventricular ejection
fraction of 55% with thickened aortic valve leaflets and
aortic valve area of 0.7 cm squared.

She underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2176-7-9**], which showed severe aortic
stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.5 cm squared.  No
significant mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of 60%,
mean aortic valve gradient of 49 mm Hg and moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  No significant coronary artery disease.  She
was referred to Cardiac Surgery for aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Aortic stenosis.
2. Asthma.
3. Thyroiditis.
4. Questionable history of gastric ulcer
5. Status post right oophorectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Vioxx which gives her a rash.

with a 21 mm CarboMedics mechanical valve.  Patient tolerated
the procedure well, and was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit in stable condition.  The patient was weaned and
extubated from mechanical ventilation on the first
postoperative evening.

Patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the
floor on postoperative day #1.  The patient was started on

began to diurese.

On postoperative day #3, patient began complaining that she
was having increasing wheezing.

On postoperative day #4, patient complained of incisional
chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Chest x-ray at that

patient was found to have bilateral wheezes.  The patient was
medicated with an albuterol nebulizer and given Percocet for
pain relief.  Patient's Lasix was increased to IV and she
continued to diurese well.

Postoperative day #5, the patient's INR increased from 1.1 to
2.5, and rose to a high of 3.8 on postoperative day #7.
Patient had been cleared by Physical Therapy on postoperative
day #3.  The patient continued to ambulate in the hallway,
and on postoperative day #8, patient was cleared for
discharge to home.

0.8, glucose 106.  PT 23.5, INR 3.9.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 40 mg po bid x2 weeks.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq po bid x2 weeks.
3. Colace 100 mg po bid while taking Percocet.
4. Enteric coated aspirin 81 mg po q day.
5. Atenolol 75 mg po q day.
6. Flovent MDI two puffs [**Hospital1 **].
7. Atrovent two puffs [**Hospital1 **].

drawn [**7-26**], results are to be called to Dr.[**Name (NI) 10373**]
office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**], and his office is to determine
further dosing.  Patient's goal INR is 2.5-3.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Aortic stenosis.
2. Status post aortic valve replacement minimally invasive
with a 21 mm CarboMedics valve.
3. Asthma.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
