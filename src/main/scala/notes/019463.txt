History of Present Illness:
51 yoM smoker w/ a h/o hyperlipidemia presents for elective
cath. The patient has had 3 months of dyspnea on exertion (6
stairs while carrying boxes, in addition to chest pain if he
proceeded beyond 6 stairs). He did not experience any
lightheadedness, or any palpitations. He did not see a physician
about this until last week where he saw his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was sent for
a stress this week, was positive and sent for cath today. He was
noted to have elevated LV pressures consistent with fluid
overload. Was admitted for diuresis.
.
He denies any rest symptoms. The symptoms have not been very
progressive, they have been relatively stable over the past few
weeks. He had no radiation of his symptoms, no association with
nausea or other symptoms.
.
He denies orthopnea, PND, pedal edema. He has had some
diaphoresis at nighttime in addition to possible claudication
symptoms (R calf cramping during sleep).
.
For these symptoms he had a stress test which was positive
(limited exercise tolerance, nuclear imaging with an EF 18%,
marked LV dilation and large inf wall fixed defect, small apical
fixed defect, reversible septal perfusion abnormality- performed
on [**2195-12-29**]). Based on these stress results he was referred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cathterization.
.
His cardiac cath revealed 3VD in addition to Left Main disease
(LMCA ostial 70%, 100% mid LAD, 80% prox D1, LCx 50-60%
proximal, OM1 70%, RCA 100% mid- fills via L--> R collaterals
from LAD.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
deonstrated left main with three vessel coronary artery disease.
 The
LMCA had a 70% ostial stenosis.  The LAD was totally occluded in
the
mid-vessel and there were no collaterals seen to the mid or
distal LAD.
There was an 80% stenosis of the first diagonal branch.  The LCx
had
50-60% stenosis of the proximal vessel.  There was a 70%
stenosis at the
origin of the OM1 branch.  The RCA had a long 60% proximal
stenosis and
was totally occluded in the mid vesel.  The mid RCA filled via
right to
right and left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right but primarily
elevated
left sided filling pressures with RVEDP mildly elevated at
16mmHg, adn
LVEDP elevated at 32 mmHg with mean PCWP 26mmHg.  There was
moderate
pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.  The cardiac index was

depressed at 1.3 l/min/m2.
3. There was no evidence of aortic stenosis on careful pullback
of the
angled pigtail catheter from the left ventricle to the ascending
aorta.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
2. Marked left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. No evidence of constrictive or restrictive cardiomyopathy or
intracardiac shunt by oximetry.

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10-15%). The
estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). A large
(1.7 x 1.7-cm) apical thrombus is seen in the left ventricle.
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Large apical LV thrombus.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Elevated filling pressures with
mild pulmonary hypertension.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had 70%
ostial
stenosis. The LAD had 100% mid LAD, and sequential 80% diagonal
branch
lesions. The LCX had 70% origin diesease in a small OMB1. The
RCA was
100% occluded in the proximal vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics were performed. The systemic
arterial
pressure was borderline low measuring 90/68mmHg despite inotrpic
support
through dopamine infusion.
3. Successful placement of Tandem Heart.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the D1 with a 2.5x15mm and a
2.5x23mm
Promus stents that were postdilated to 2.5mm. Final angiography
revealed
no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection
and TIMI
III flow (see PTCA comments).
5. IVUS was performed confirming full stent expansion to the
diagonal
branch and a 5.3mm2 CSA in the LMCA suggesting hemodynamically
significant stenosis.
6. Successful direct stenting of the LMCA stenosis with a
3.5x12mm
Promus stent. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis,
no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA

comments).
7. Unsuccessful attempt to cross the RCA CTO with multiple
wires.
8. Successful weaning of hemodynamic support and removal of
Tandem Heart
cannulas.
9. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device through the
left
common femoral artery.
10. Successful deployment of 3 Proglide Perclose device across
the the
right common femoral artery with good hemostasis.
11. Transthoracic echocardiogram perfo
