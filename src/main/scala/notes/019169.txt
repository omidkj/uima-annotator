Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20224**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old with tachy-brady w/PCM, recent acute
on chronic SDH, hip fx 6 weeks ago who presents with failure to
thrive and hypoxia. Per ED report and NH notes, patient was 92%
on RA at the NH. He has lost 15-20 lbs in the past 6 weeks with
poor PO intake. Per family history, his mental status prior to
recent hospitalizations was good, able to converse, visiting
friends. Since hip fracture, his mental status has decreased,
frequently disoriented but intermittently answering questions.
However, the son reports that his mental status seems to have
worsened over the past week and that he seems to be grimacing in
pain as well.
.
Of note his was admitted from [**Date range (2) 84758**] for right hip
fracture, SHD and an episode of torsades. Torsades may have been
due to florouquinolones, which were subsequently avoided. EP
also increased demand pacing to 80 and pt was started on
metoprolol. His subdural hematomas were followed on serial HCT
and were found to be stable. There was also a concern for
aspiration pneumonitis, although S/S eval cleared the pt for
thicked fluids but was concerned for aspiraton.
.
In the ED: He was found to he in afib at 112 w/o ischemic
changes, slightly elevated trop at 0.04. Cardiology consulted
w/o recommended no intervention. CT abd noted a large amount of
stool and very large left effusion with lung collapse. He was
given Zosyn and Levofloxacin. Initially his lactate was 3.9 but
improved with one liter NS to 2.0.
vitals:99.8, BP 109/89, 100-140's in afib, 93% RA -98%2L

CXR [**2179-10-30**]: Significant right hemithorax opacification, likely
secondary to large effusion and pulmonary consolidation.
Underlying pneumonia/aspiration cannot be excluded.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2179-10-30**]: 1. Large right pleural effusion with
right lung base consolidation likely reflecting atelectasis
though pneumonia cannot be excluded. Small left effusion with
basilar atelectasis.
2. Cardiomegaly with pacer device in place.
3. Marked fecal loading of the rectal vault suggesting
impaction. Recommend disimpaction and clinical correlation.
4. Ectatic infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3.4 cm in
diameter
transverse.

CT Head [**2179-10-30**]: Bilateral subdural hematomas with approximately
6 mm of midline shift; New mildly hyperdense dependent material
within the left subdural hematoma may represent acute blood.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

5. Marked atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominopelvic
vasculature.
6. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

TTE [**2179-10-30**]: Suboptimal image quality. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%) with basal to mid lateral
hypokinesis suggested. The apex is not seen. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: [**Age over 90 **] year old with hypoxia, delerium, afib
w/PPM, acute on chronic SDH, recnet hip fracture s/p repair.

Hypoxia: The patient was mildly intermittently hypoxic. The
patient had no fever or WBC count on admission. CT scan reveals
a very large unilateral effusion of unclear etiology.  This
pleural effusion was minimal on most recent CT from 09/[**2178**].
Given a very short timeline of accumulation, we felt that it may
be most consistent with parapneumonic effusion secondary to
aspiration.  Other possible etiologies include malignancy.  He
was started on empiric antibiotics for health care associated
pneumonia. His respiratory status remained stable. The effusion
was evaluated by US for consideration of thoracentesis and found
to be loculated. Given that appropriate treatment of this would
include a chest tube to be placed, this prompted a meeting with
the son and HCP, [**Name (NI) **]. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] the multiple medical problems
Mr. [**Known lastname 84759**] [**Last Name (Titles) 84760**] it was determined that proceeding with
painful invasive procedures that likely would not change his
over-all prognosis, duration of life remaining, or quality of
life would be in his best interest. Given this arrangements were
made for him to go home with hospice.

Delerium: Per his son he has been delerious since his admit in
[**9-1**] for hip fracture and initial subdural hemorrhage. Prior to
that hospitalization he had been at home with 12-24 hour care
and was sleeping 22 hours a day. He has been at this stage for
months prior. He was noted to have bradycardia with placment of
ppm 3-4 months ago, but this did not improve his energy during
the day or hours of wakefulness. Given the on-going delerium his
over-all prognosis is quite poor.

Atrial fibrilation: Heart rate was controlled with metoprolol,
this does not need to be continued at home. He has a primary
pace maker but not a defibrilator.

Constipation: He was noted to be impacted on admission. This
improved with enemas and bowel regimen. He is recommended to use
suppositories as needed for constipation that causes discomfort.


Pain: He was noted to have pain on moving him, thought possibly
due to his hip fracture vs. his sacral decubitus ulcer. He was
started on oral morphine liquid to help control pain.

Subdural hemorrhage: He was noted to have acute on chronic
subdural hemorrhage on admission. He was evaluated by
neurosurgery who recommended non-opperative management. His
aspirin was stopped.
