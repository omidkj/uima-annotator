CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2168-2-13**] 9:48 AM Interval
evacuation of right subdural hematoma with expected
postoperative change. Persistent mass effect on the subjacent
sulci and leftward shift of the normally midline structures,
which is decreased from prior. New 1 cm focus of hyperdensity in
the right inferior temporal lobe could represent
intraparenchymal hemorrhage versus volume averaging with
extra-axial blood products. Attention on followup is
recommended.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2168-2-13**] 7:18 AM IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged multifocal opacities, possibly representing
infection
superimposed on a chronic interstitial process. Again CT could
be performed for better evaluation.
2. Endotracheal tube in place.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2168-2-13**] 6:17 AM IMPRESSION:
Acutely worsening right subdural hemorrhage increasing in size,
now measuring 22 from 10 mm in maximal transverse dimension with
associated
worsening mass effect, with leftward shift by 13 mm increased
from 2 mm.
Stable small 3-mm maximal transverse dimension left subdural
hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 83year old male who fell at home and presented to an
outside emergency department remembering the event.  He had
called neighbor for
help and went to the outside hospital and had his head lac
sutured.
The initial head CT showed bilateral SDH and he was transferred
here for further care. Upon initial review the patient denied
headache,weakness, numbness. The patient had complaints of
nausea and vomiting.  The patient's mental status declined in
emergency department requiring intubation.  The repeat Head CT
at approximately 0615 am was comsistent with acutely worsening
right subdural hemorrhage increasing in size, measuring 22 from
10 mm in maximal transverse dimension with associated
worsening mass effect, with leftward shift by 13 mm increased
from 2 mm.
Stable small 3-mm maximal transverse dimension left subdural
hemorrhage. The patient was brought emergently for right sided
craniotomy.  The patient was brought to the PACU for recovery
and the patients heart rate was bradycardic to 34.  The patient
was given 0.5 mg atropine without improvement in the heart rate.
 The patient was given another 0.5mg atropine without
significant change in heart rate.  The code team arrived to the
pacu and the patient was given a dose of epinephrine.  The
patients blood pressure was in the systolic ragne of 130-140.
The patient responded to the epinephrine with a hreat rate to
the 60s and a blood pressure of 170/80.  The patient was brought
for a Stat Head CT which was consistent with expected
post-ioperative changes.  The patient was transferred to the
trauma intensive care unit.  The patients family made the
decision to make the patient care and comfort measures only.
The patient was extubated and was declared deceased at 1500 on
[**2168-2-13**].
