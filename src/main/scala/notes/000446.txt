Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Most of the interview was conducted with telephone interpretor
as patient is
Russian speaking only.

   [**Age over 90 **]yo female Russian speaking only resident of [**Hospital1 5595**] with CAD,
CHF (EF 25%), HTN, and Afib, recently admitted with episode of
PNA vs. CHF exacerbation on [**2163-9-29**], now presents with chest
pain, abdominal pain and hypotension.  The chest pain is located
in the right side of the chest and radiates to the back.  The
pain is characterized as the same chest pain she has had for
most of her life and is rated [**2169-5-5**], no radiations and
nonpositional, no associated diaphoresis.  She had one episode
of n/v, early today.  The emesis was clear without signs of
blood or coffee grounds. She describes her abdominal pain as
generalized, diffuse, x 2d. She denies any current abdominal
pain. Her last bowel movement was three days prior to admission.

   In the ED, her BP was 98/66 and dropped to 60/40 sitting and
80/60 lying after ASA, SL NTG and lasix (given for ?ACS, CHF)
->1400 cc u/o. She begun dopamine to avoid fluid boluses given
her CHF. The patient was subsequently given morphine for chest
pain refractory to nitro which lead to further decrease in BP to
46/24 (15 min. after morphine was given).  She failed a weaning
trial of dopamine with BP of 79/50.  She then received decadron
10mg IV along with levofloxacin 500mg IVx1 and Flagyl 500mg IV
x1 for ?PNA, and sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for w/u.
   The patient also reports some baseline shortness of breath
with a chronic cough that has been present for 2 years.  The
cough has periods of improvement and worsening.  Recently, the
cough has worsened over the last two weeks with some clear
sputum production (since her recent discharge).  The patient
also reports some subjective fevers, and chills, but denies
rigors. She is DNR/DNI.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **]yo female resident of [**Hospital1 5595**] with CAD, HTN and recent admit
for PNA and CHF exacerbation (admitted [**2163-9-27**]-discharged
[**2163-9-29**]) presents with CP, abd pain and hypotension.

1: Hypoxia: We thought that her hypoxia might have been
secondary to fluid overload/CHF or a pneumonia.  We thus
broadened her coverage by adding zosyn. She also received small
doses of IV lasix with a small improvement.  She eventually
weaned from a NRB to 6L nasal cannula on the day of discharge.
We advise continued weaning of her oxygen as tolerated by the
patient.

2.  Hypotension: We thought that the patient's hypotension was
secondary to volume depletion as demonstrated by its rapid
response with IV fluids.  We held her antihypertensive
medications initally and slowly added them as her pressure
stabilized.

3.  Chest pain: We were concerned that her chest pain might have
been secondary to an acute coronary syndrome.  She was ruled out
with negative serial cardiac enzymes and the absence or ECG
changes. We increased her

3.  PNA: The patient was first started on levoquin but in light
of her increasing hypoxia she was switched to zosyn to broaden
her coverage. She remained afebrile and without a leukoctyosis
was thus discharged on a 7 day course of levofloxacin.

4.  Abd pain:  The occurance of abdominal pain is conincident
with her recent onset of constipation.  The abd on exam is soft,
and completely benign, without a suggestion of a surgical
abdomen.  The pain is most likely secondary to constipation.
Her abdominal pain and distension improved significantly with
the administration of an enema which resulted in a successful
bowel movement.

5.  Afib/Sick Sinus:  Pt is s/p pacemaker placement.  While in
the ICU she was on telemetry and her heart rate did not
decreased to less than 80.

6.  CHF: We held her cardiac meds in light of her hypotension.
On the day of discharge we had restarted metoprolol and we
advise that the other medications be slowly added as her blood
pressure tolerates.

7.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was continued on heparin SQ for
DVT prophylaxis along with a PPI as per her outpatient regimen.
