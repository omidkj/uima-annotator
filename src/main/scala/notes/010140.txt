Acute Left Face, Arm, Leg Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
* None


History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
86 F w/ hx CHF, HTN, AF, on coumadin, COPD, aortic stenosis,
presented to [**Hospital3 15402**] Hosp with dyspnea. While being treated
there, at about 6:55 am, she developed sudden onset L-face, arm,
and leg weakness, that was severe. A code stroke was
called, and she was given IV tPA, and subsequently transferred
to
[**Hospital1 18**], where strength seemed to be modestly improving evidenced
by some movement of the LUE, though mostly not against gravity.
She remained somewhat letharic at [**Hospital1 18**] and had a repeat NCHCT
with CTA. Oxygen requirements were increased to the point of
being on CPAP. CXR showed [**Hospital1 65**] pulm edema and she was given an
add'l 40 mg Lasix IV.

IMAGING

.
Chest X-ray ([**2108-12-14**]):
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with moderate congestive heart
failure and
probable small bilateral pleural effusions.

CTA head/neck [**2108-12-14**]
1. Large acute infarct in the right PCA territory. Patent
carotid and
vertebral arteries, including right posterior cerebral artery
through its
mid-distal P2 segment, without evidence of stenosis.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial pulmonary edema,
and left
upper lobe focal opacity, which could be atelectasis; pneumonic
consolidation
is not excluded.

MRI brain [**2108-12-14**]
FINDINGS: There is a large area of restricted diffusion in the
right PCA
territory, corresponding to abnormalities seen on recent CT
perfusion. The
infarction extends from the medial aspect of the right
cerebellar hemisphere,
possibly tiny focus in the vermis and involves medial right
temporal lobe,
extending to the midbrain and thalamus (series 8, image 14).
There is
vasogenic edema, with mild mass effect on sulci, but no shift of
normally
midline structures or herniation. The remainder of the brain
demonstrates
periventricular and subcortical FLAIR hyperintensities, which
could represent
small vessel ischemic changes. There are no areas of
susceptibility artifact
to suggest presence of hemorrhage. The major vascular flow voids
are
maintained.

CT head [**2108-12-15**]
IMPRESSION: Large right PCA territory infarct and right
cerebellum infarct as
described above. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or shift of
normally midline
structures. Exam is slightly limited due to patient motion.

CT head [**2108-12-16**]
1. Continued evolution of a right PCA territorial infarct with
increased
hypodensity in this region. No areas concerning for hemorrhage.

2. No new areas concerning for acute infarct; however, this
evaluation is
limited by the pronounced periventricular white matter
hypodensities which
appear unchanged.

3. No midline shift, and no evidence for herniation.

CXR [**2108-12-17**]
Nasogastric tube ends in the region of the pylorus or first
portion of the
duodenum. Generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality is most
commonly
edema, but needs to be followed to differentiate it from
interstitial lung
disease acute or chronic. Heart is moderately enlarged,
particularly the left
atrium proximal to a heavily calcified mitral annulus, the
pulmonary arteries
are very large and there is some mediastinal vascular
engorgement indicating
biventricular decompensation as the most likely diagnosis. Small
bilateral
pleural effusions are unchanged since earlier in the day. Some
focal
opacities developing in the left suprahilar lung may represent
infection, also
warranting followup. No pneumothorax.

TTE [**2108-12-18**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an
