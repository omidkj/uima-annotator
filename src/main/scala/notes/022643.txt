Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2190-3-12**]
Interval craniotomies, coiling of MCA aneurysm and placement of
ventriculostomy catheter with improvement in extensive
previously seen
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Post-operative pneumocephalus.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2190-3-13**]
1. Post left craniotomy changes, with unchanged subarachnoid
blood products within the left frontoparietal, temporal and
right frontal lobes.
2. Unchanged position of a right frontal approach
ventriculostomy catheter
terminating at the right lateral ventricle.
3. No evidence of new hemorrhage or mass effect since the
[**2190-3-12**]
study.

CT Head [**2190-3-15**]
1. Increasing areas of low attenuation and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
and white
matter differentiation in the territory of the left MCA, may be
secondary to evolving infarction or evolving edema adjacent to
the hematoma.
2. Stable appearance of subarachnoid blood, without evidence of
new
hemorrhage.
3. Slight enlargement of the left frontal extra-axial collection
beneath the left craniotomy changes.
4. Unchanged mass effect with 5.5 mm of rightward shift of the
normal midline structures. No evidence of uncal herniation.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2190-3-15**]
1. No retroperitoneal hematoma, as clinically questioned.
2. Indeterminate 17-mm hypodense lesion within the left lobe of
the liver.
Ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation,
non-emergently.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis

CTA Head [**2190-3-16**]
1. No evidence of vasospasm with symmetric, patent bilateral
MCAs.
2. Metallic coil in unchanged position at the bifurcation of the
M1 and M2
segments. A small residual aneurysm is likely present in this
region.
3. Unchanged appearance of subarachnoid, intraparenchymal, and
intraventricular hemorrhages. No new foci of hemorrhage are
visualized.
4. Stable areas of low attenuation in the territory of the left
MCA are most likely due to vasogenic edema from the surrounding
hematomas, although an underlying evolving infarction cannot be
totally excluded.
5. Unchanged position of the right frontal ventriculostomy
catheter without evidence of hydrocephalus.
6. Unchanged post-surgical changes in the left frontal lobe

CXR [**2190-3-16**]
AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
sitting semi-upright position. Comparison is made with the next
preceding
similar study of [**2190-3-14**]. The patient remains
intubated, ETT in
unchanged position. A right-sided PICC line has now been
adjusted and its tip is seen to terminate in the mid portion of
the SVC. Nasogastric tube reaches well into the stomach where it
is curled up as before.
No interval changes are seen in the normal-appearing
cardiovascular pulmonary status on this portable chest
examination.

CXR [**2190-3-17**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-16**], the endotracheal tube
appears
to have been removed. Other monitoring and support devices
remain in place.  Little change in the appearance of the heart
and lungs

CTA [**2190-3-17**]
1. No evidence of vasospasm. Bilateral MCA are patent.
2. A coil pack is present in the left MCA bifurcation of M1 and
M2 with a 3.5 mm dilatation just medial and superior to the coil
pack likely representing residual aneursym.
3. Subarachnoid blood mildly decreased since the prior exam.
4. Stable left frontal intraparenchymal and intraventricular
hematomas as well as stable left frontal subdural collection
causing a stable mass effect with 7 mm midline shift to the
right.
5. Stable areas of low attenuation in the territory of the left
MCA are most likely due to vasogenic edema from the surrounding
hematomas, although an underlying evolving infarction cannot be
totally excluded.
6. Stable position of the right frontal ventriculostomy catheter
without
evidence of hydrocephalus.

CT head [**2190-3-19**]
Right common carotid artery arteriogram shows widely patent
right
internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery and anterior
cerebral artery with no evidence of spasm.
Left common carotid artery arteriogram shows that the left
internal carotid artery, left anterior cerebral artery and left
middle cerebral artery are patent with no evidence of spasm. The
aneurysm is still patent with coils at the tip where the rupture
site was.
Left vertebral artery arteriogram shows that both PCAs are
patent.
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 35962**] underwent cerebral angiography which showed that
there was no vasospasm. We did not treat the aneurysm on this
setting since she would require Plavix for the stent and she
still had a ventricular catheter in.  After the ventricular
catheter is removed, she will be brought back for definitive
treatment of this aneurysm.


CXR [**2190-3-20**]
Previous mild pulmonary edema has almost resolved. Heterogeneous

opacification in the infrahilar right lower lung could be
residual edema and atelectasis or early pneumonia. Pleural
effusion on the right is small if any. Heart size top normal.
Nasogastric feeding tube ends in the stomach.  Right PIC line
ends close to the anticipated location of the superior
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax

CXR [**2190-3-21**]
The right lower lobe opacity is again redemonstrated, concerning
for
infectious process in the right lower lobe. Dobbhoff tube tip is
in the
stomach. The right PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.

CXR [**2190-3-22**]
Tip of the right PIC line projects over the upper right atrium
and would need to be withdrawn 2.5 cm to confidently place it in
the low SVC. No
endotracheal tube seen below C6, the upper margin of this film.
Feeding tube is looped in the stomach. Minimal pulmonary edema
has developed in the right lower lobe and the heart though still
normal size is slightly larger. No pneumothorax. Pleural
effusions small if any.

CT head [**2190-3-22**]
1. Decrease in residual intraparenchymal, subarachnoid, and
intraventricular hemorrhage with no new foci of hemorrhage.
2. Slight decrease in edema surrounding the left temporoparietal
hematoma,
although residual sulcal effacement and rightward shift of the
normal midline structures persist.
3. Small amount of post-surgical pneumocephalus around the right

ventriculostomy catheter, without evidence of hemorrhage.
4. Stable post-craniotomy changes with a decrease in size of the
adjacent
subdural and subgaleal hematomas

[**2190-3-22**] LENS
No evidence of right or left deep vein thrombosis.

[**2190-3-23**] CT head FINDINGS: There is a right-sided ventriculostomy
catheter through a right frontal burr hole approach. The
catheter appears to course through the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right
lateral ventricle but terminates just lateral to the ventricle
itself. A small amount of postoperative pneumocephalus is
adjacent to the catheter and u
