Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Low normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal.
3. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate mitral annular calcification of the posterior leaflet
of the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS:
For the post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine and was A paced.
1. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are
normal.
2. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
3. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-2-12**] 2:10 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: ? effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? effusion
HISTORY: Status post CABG.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-10**], the patient has
taken a much better inspiration. The right IJ catheter has been
removed. There is persistent enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette in a patient with recent CABG procedure and intact
sternal sutures. Opacification behind the heart is consistent
with a substantial left effusion. Smaller right effusion.
Minimal indistinctness of pulmonary vessels suggests some
residual increased pulmonary venous pressure.
