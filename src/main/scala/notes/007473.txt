Pertinent Results:
[**12-28**] Chest CT: Severe coronary artery calcifications. Extensive

[**12-31**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**11-19**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results on Mr[**Known lastname **] at before surgical incision.
POST-BYPASS: Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF
55%. The aortic bioprosthesis is insitu, stable and functioning

Brief Hospital Course:
Following completion of his preoperative workup he was taken to
the Operating Room on [**12-31**] where aortic valve replacement and
quintuple bypass grafts were performed.  See operative note for
details.  He weaned from bypass in stable condition on Neo
synephrine and Propofol.

Following transfer to the ICU he remained stable, weaned from
pressors and was extubated the night of surgery.
Wires and tubes were d/c'd per cardiac surgery protocol. Pt
receiving ACE inhibitor, statin and betablocker. Has been in
rate controlled afib.  Progressed well and was evaluated by
physical therapy and thought to benefit from rehab stay prior to
returning to home.  The patient was discharged in good condition
to rehab on POD 5.  All follow up instructions were advised.
