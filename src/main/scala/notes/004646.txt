Chief Complaint:
palpitations

none


History of Present Illness:
47yo woman with paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (multiple
admissions since [**2186**]), HTN, and asthma presents with
palpatations, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. She started
having what she describes as a cold 9 days ago with fevers to
100, body aches, cough, and chills. She had Sx of worsening
asthma and received treatments of Combivent x 3 as an
outpatient. She was doing well until 5am on day of admission,
when she experienced chest pain with palpatations and difficulty
breathing and came to the ED, where she was found to be in
Atrial Fibrillation. As is typical for her, she described chest
pain with her palpitations that felt like her GERD, "burning,
like I can feel something sour coming up from my stomach to my
throat."
.
Of note, she was seen by cardiology one month ago, when her
atenolol was increased to 75mg daily.  She lost the
prescription, and has only been taking 50mg daily.  She reports
she is compliant with her medications, and has not noticed
worsening asthma on the atenolol.
.
In the ED, her VS were: 96.1 140 159/111 20 98%. On presentation
to the ED, she was short of breath and wheezing, c/o chest pain
and back pain in the left and right shoulder blades. She
continued to c/o heartburn. She received solumedrol 120mg IV x
1, combivent nebs x 3 for wheezing. She was given diltiazem 20mg
IV x 2 then diltiazem 30mg po x1, diltiazem 10mg iv x 1 followed
by diltiazem gtt. She was also given morphine 2mg IV x 2,
calcium carbonate 500mg po x 2, and ASA 325mg po. She received
pepcid and po lidocaine for heartburn with good effect. There
was a suspicion of PE or dissection b/c of her back pain; she
could not lie flat due to her respiratory status, and she
refused intubation for CTA to rule out PE or dissection. Of
note, D dimer was elevated at 757. She was admitted to the CCU.

.
Upon admission to the CCU, she was in AFib with a rate of 145,
systolic BP in the 80s. The IV through which she had been
administered diltiazem was noted to be infiltrated. A new
peripheral IV was obtained and she was given diltiazem 20mg IV x
1.  Soon after, she was found to be in NSR.  Her respiratory
status improved and her BP stabilized to 120 systolic.  Back
pain resolved.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
syncope or presyncope.

.
EKG demonstrated NSR with slight left axis deviation, poor R
wave progression; no significant change compared with prior
dated [**4-23**].
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: AFib with RVR to 140s, currently in NSR

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2188-7-2**] demonstrated:
"Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade."
.
CXR [**8-2**]:
The degree of cardiomegaly is unchanged from recent prior
radiograph. There is interval increase in the pulmonary
vascularity, may represent worsening of the CHF. There is no
consolidation or evidence of pneumothorax on this single frontal
view.

Brief Hospital Course:
47yo woman presenting with atrial fibrillation in the setting of
frequent albuterol usage during asthma exacerbation.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
Patient was given diltiazem and soon thereafter was found to be
in normal sinus rhythm.  She did not have further episodes of
AFib during admission.  Although she was managed with atenolol
prior to admission and did not endorse worsening bronchospasm,
it was felt that a calcium channel blocker might be a better
medication for rate control given her concurrent asthma
exacerbation.  This change was discussed with her cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**].  As for an inciting cause for her AFib, TSH levels
were normal in [**10-30**] and [**3-31**] and were not rechecked on this
admission.  Ischemia is also a possible cause, but EKG did not
show concerning changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.  It
was felt that her increased use of albuterol might have caused
her to go into AFib.
.
The patient's CHADS2 score is only 1 (HTN), though she might
have early diabetes given that she had some mildly elevated
blood sugars during admission.  In addition, her cardiologist is
currently working her up for possible hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.  A cardiac MR was ordered, but the patient
missed her appointment secondary to a recent cold.  If the
patient does indeed have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, this in
itself may be an indication for treatment with coumadin for her
paroxysmal AFib.  The team will defer to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 171**] for further
management of this issue.
