History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28466**] is an 82 year old right handed woman fell off her
chaor and may have had a syncopal event. She lost

any neck pain, paresthesia, numbness or other pain.
Neurosurgery consulted for further management.

CT head [**2130-12-19**]
1. A 1.5 cm right frontoparietal subdural hematoma with leftward
midline
shift by about 7 mm. No evidence of transtentorial or tonsillar
herniation. A
few hypodense foci within may relate to ongoing hemorrhage-
correlate for
coagulopathy. Small focus of acute hemorrhage in the left
insular region.
2. No definite underlying fracture. Right cheek bruising.
3. Bilateral paranasal sinus disease.
CT head [**2130-12-19**]

[**2130-12-19**] Echocardiogram
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Vigorous biventricular systolic function without
outflow tract obstruction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

[**2130-12-19**] Ct C-spine
1. No definite evidence of cervical spine fracture.
2. Severe multilevel cervical spine degenerative disease with
canal narrowing and neural foraminal narrowing. This predisposes
patient to cord or ligamentous injury in the setting of trauma,
which can be evaluated by MRI if not CI, if necessary.
3. Paranasal sinus disease.
4. Severe biapical emphysema.
5. Incomplete assessment of a moderate right hemispheric
subdural hematoma, to be correlated with head CT

[**2130-12-19**] CT head
1. Interval stability and acute right subdural hematoma with no
change in the degree of mass effect within the limitations of
technique differences.
2. Evidence of possible active hemorrhage or old subdural
hematoma, admixed with new blood. Investigation into possible
causes of ongoing hemorrhage such as coagulopathy or
anticoagulants is recommended. Close follow up with subsequent
head CT is recommended if no surgical intervention is planned.
3. Additional small focus of cortical hemorrhage near the left
sylvian
fissure/adjacent cortex which has demonstrated interval
stability withs
lightly decreased density but should be followed closely on
subsequent
examinations.

[**12-21**] Carotid Duplex: Impression: Right ICA no stenosis.
Left ICA <40% stenosis.

[**12-21**] EEG: preliminary no seizure activity


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28466**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgery under the care of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for Acute SDH. She was loaded with Dilantin and then
started on 100mg po TID. Platelets were 301 and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
recommend platelet trasnfusion. She was admited to the neuro ICU
for frequent neuro check, Due to her syncopal event,
Echocardiogram was done as well as an EEG and ECG. Her Troponin
was normal and Aspirin was held. SBP goal was < 140, nicardipine
gtt as needed, hydralazine PRN.

The patient remained neurologically stable therefore it was
decided to wait until [**12-20**] to undergo a craniotomy and
evacuation of the SDH. On [**12-20**] the patient developed respiratory
distress and and copious amounts of tan/brown sputum. She was
started on Levaquin, sputum was sent for culture and her surgery
was canceled.
On [**12-21**] she was again neurologically well and had improved from
a respiratory standpoint. She was opting not to undergo surgery
at this point. It was decided that it would be best for her to
go to a rehab and return in a few weeks when her respiratory
status had improved and the blood products have broken down. She
was cleared for transfer to the floor at this point and PT/OT
were consulted for assistance with discharge planning.  As part
of the syncope work up a carotid duplex was obtained (no
significant stenosis) and an EEG was performed (prelim no
seizure activity).

On [**12-22**] she was ambulating with assistance to the bathroom and
had much better pain control. Dilantin level was therapeutic at
12.3. PT and OT recommended discharge to inpatient rehab
facility. Family was updated of the plan and she was cleared for
discharge.
