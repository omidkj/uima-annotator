MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2164-8-9**] 10:53 PM
MR THORACIC SPINE W/O CONTRAST; MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip #
[**Clip Number (Radiology) **]-FINDINGS: At T8-9 level, there is increased signal seen
within the disc on
T2-weighted images with disruption of the anterior longitudinal
ligament.
There is decreased T1 and increased inversion recovery signal in
the adjacent vertebral bodies. In addition, linear increased
signal indicating fracture is seen through the posterior
elements with signal abnormalities involving the articular
processes of T9. On the axial T2-weighted images, there appears
to be 50% narrowing of the spinal canal due to surrounding soft
tissue changes to the thecal sac. In addition, mild paraspinal
hematoma is identified. No abnormal increased signal seen within
the spinal cord.
In the upper thoracic spine, there is to be fusion between T4, 5
and 6
vertebral bodies with partial obliteration of the intervertebral
discs. There is chronic compression of T7 vertebra identified
and T11 vertebra also demonstrates chronic compression fracture.
There is no abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
IMPRESSION:
1. Fracture through T8-9 discs and the posterior elements with
disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament as well as
probably the posterior
longitudinal ligament and buckling of the ligamentum flavum at
this level.
2. Paraspinal hematoma and probable intraspinal hematoma around
the thecal sac at T8-9 with 50% narrowing of the spinal canal.
3. No abnormal signal within the spinal cord.
4. Chronic fusion in the vertebral bodies could be due to
diffuse idiopathic hyperostosis.
5. Chronic compressions of T7 and T11 are identified.
LUMBAR SPINE:
FINDINGS: At L1-2 to L5-S1 level, disc degenerative changes are
identified. No spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing seen. No
disc herniation seen. No compression fracture identified. The
sacrum demonstrates normal signal.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or subluxation in the lumbar region.
Degenerative
changes without spinal stenosis.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2164-8-10**]  8:25:42 AM
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Diffuse
ST-T wave changes which are non-specific. No previous tracing
available for comparison.
.
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2164-8-10**] 3:26 AM
CT THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST: Study is extremely limited
by streak
artifact from the patient's arms within the gantry as well as
motion artifact. The sagittal reconstruction demonstrates
approximately 8 mm of retrolisthesis of T8 on T9. Widening of
the anterior vertebral body space is consistent with complete
rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament. While study is
limited given motion artifact at this level, bilateral pedicle
and laminar fractures are detected at the T9 level. Surrounding
hematoma noted at this level. An old compression fracture
deformity noted at the T7 level.
IMPRESSION:
Traumatic retrolisthesis of T8 on T9 with rupture of the
anterior longitudinal ligament and bilateral fractures of the
posterior elements at T9. This fracture is considered unstable
and appropriate precautions should be taken.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2164-8-10**] 6:44 AM
The hemidiaphragms are in normal position, there is no evidence
of pleural
effusions. The size and shape of the cardiac silhouette are
within normal
range. There is slight tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The
lung parenchyma has normal structure and transparency, there is
no evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of
pneumonia, no signs of o
