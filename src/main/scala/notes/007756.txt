Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness and dysarthria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
81 M with unknown PMH was transfered from OSh for evaluation. He
was found in the car seat this pm outside an electronic store.
Police and EMTs were called and he was found to have "weakness
on
the right side" and garbled speech. He was taken to OSH where he
was found to be hypothermic (95) and drowsy. He was intubated
for
airway protection later in the am around (5) after giving
dilantin 1 gm, Etomidate 20, veceuronium 10, fentanyl 100.
Initially his BP was 133/84 when he presented at 1 pm which
later
peaked to 231/84 at 3 pm and was given labetelol IV for BP
control which was 194/79 around 5 pm before transfer. At OSH,
INR
1.1, CBC showed 6.2/13.7-42/ plt of 117. EKG showed NSR and RBBB
, No ST/T change. CT head showed 3 by 3 cm left BG bleed with
IVH, 3rd and 4th ventricle with midline shift of 3 mm. He was
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. Next, neurology and neurosurgery were
called.

NCHCT [**2145-1-28**]:
(prelim)
1. No evidence of new bleed. Unchanged size of hematoma in the
left basal
ganglia.
2. Resolution of blood in the right lateral ventricle, fourth
ventricle and third ventricle.
3. Slight increase in extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage likely
secondary to redistribution from the original bleed. There is no
evidence of new
hemorrhage.

NCHCT [**2145-1-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Overall stable appearance of left basal ganglia
intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema, but no significant midline
shift. No
herniation or definite evidence of hydrocephalus.
2. Intraventricular hemorrhage involving nearly all the left
lateral
ventricle with extension in the right lateral ventricle and
third and fourth  ventricles; slight increase in third, fourth,
and left occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] intraventricular hemorrhage, most likely
reflects redistribution.
3. Opacification of the left frontal sinus and ethmoid mucosal
thickening may represent sinusitis.

CXR [**2145-1-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left costophrenic angle not fully included on the image.
2. Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
3. Low lung volumes with possible left base retrocardiac
atelectasis.

CXR [**1-30**]
 Increased patchy bibasilar density suspicious for pneumonia

CXR [**2-1**]
There has been no significant change since the prior chest
x-ray.
Increased retrocardiac density is again noted and atelectasis is
also seen at the right base. Underlying pneumonia, particularly
at the left may be
present.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Intracerebral hemorrhage:
Pt was admitted with a left basal ganglia bleed with significant
intraventricular extension. Neurosurgery was consulted, but they
felt there was no neurosurgical intervention needed, including
an EVD. He was initially intubated and monitored in the ICU
where his SBP was kept < 160. He was extubated and transferred
to the stroke floor. His neurological exam on discharge was
notable for inattention, fluent language, but with some element
of anomia with circumlocution. He continues to have contracted
and weak distal extremities B/L (likely realted to his [**Company 378**]), but
no clear asymmetry in the UE proximally. In the LE, the right IP
and Ham are somewhat weaker (~[**3-20**]) than the left, and he has
poor effort/ROM with ankle dorsiflexion B/L.

There was felt to be an element of overlying encephalopathy from
medications/sedatives/intubation/ICU delirium, that gradually
was improving during course. A repeat head CT showed no evidence
of hydrocephalus, which was a concern given the amount of
intraventricular blood. His mental status did take a mild turn
toward decline when he was diagnosed with PNA, but this is
expected to resolve with continued antibiotics.

The patient's prognosis remains guarded, as his ICH score was 2
or 3. His family was informed of his risk for developing
complications and not fully recovering to baseline within the
next 30 days.

All anticoagulants were held except subcutaneous heparin ppx.

HTN:
Patient has baseline severe hypertension, and was on many home
meds to control this. HCTZ/triamterene was stopped, lisinopril
was increased, and clonidine was added. Metoprolol, nifedipine
were continued.

# Inclusion body myositis:
Patient has atrophy and weakness at baseline due to [**Company 378**]. He was
walking with walker and mostly independent prior to ICH. CK and
troponin was elevated on admission, and this was likely due to
his myositis in setting of paralytics used for intubation,
rather than cardiac source. Both CK and trop trended down to
normal range.

# PNA:
Patient developed fever on [**1-30**]. CXR showed bilateral lower lobe
L>R and retrocardiac opacities c/w atelectasis plus PNA. He was
treated with vanco/zosyn for hospital-acquired PNA. He remained
afebrile, WBC trended down, and he was stable on room air.

# ELECTROLYTES:
Prior to day of discharge, sodium began to trend up. Creatinine
also began to rise, which was most c/w free water deficit and
dehydration. patient was given LR to replete K and bicarb, and
increased his free water intake. Lytes should be followed and
repleted prn, along with LR maintanence fluid and encouraging
free water intake.
