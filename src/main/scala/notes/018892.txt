Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, receurrent tracheal stenosis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2186-5-2**] Flexible bronchoscopy
[**2186-4-29**] Flexible bronchoscopy
[**2186-4-28**]: Rigid bronchoscopy with yellow [**Last Name (un) 48377**] tracheoscope.
Foreign body removal (Ultraflex stent in trachea).
[**2186-4-25**] 1. Flexible bronchoscopy. Rigid bronchoscopy.
Metal stent removal of proximal tracheal stent (alveolus 4 cm).


History of Present Illness:
61 y female with multiple medical problems who presents as a
consult for evaluation of recurrent tracheal stenosis. The
tracheal stenosis is secondary to
prolonged ICU stay w/intubation as well as traumatic
tracheostomy placement done 3 years prior following from a fall.
For approximately 2 months after removal of the tracheostomy the
patient did well but began to develop shortness of breath and
difficulty with inspiration. The patient relays that there were
2
areas of focal stenosis, the distal most which had a metal stent
placed across it. Subseuent to this the patient did well for [**9-3**]
months before having recurrence of symptoms.  Repeat
bronchoscopy demonstrated restenosis, the prior stent was not
able to be removed and a second stent was placed over the
original. This required revisions x2 for stent migration.  She
has not had a
bronchoscopy for approximately the past year with increasing
severity of symptoms. She is essentially bedridden secondary to
her morbid obesity as well as dyspnea when walking only [**2-28**]
steps. She has noted an increase in weight secondary her
imobility. She complains of cough, daily, productive of thin
yellow sputum, there is no hemoptysis, often the coughing fits
are severe and accompanied by post-tussis emesis/wretching. She
has describes mild orthopnea, and uses a BiPAP at night with
minimal symptom relief, and continues to have excessive daytime
sleepiness. She does not have any chest pain, nausea/vomiting,
no fever/chills, or epistaxis

intubation/tracheostomy
2. COPD on BiPAP
3. HTN
4. CHF: diastolic
5. Morbid obesity
6. Anemia
7. Spastic bladder/incontinence
8. Hysterectomy
9. Left knee repair

11. ? rheumatic fever as child
12. Diabetes

Social History:
lives alone in TN with assitance from son and caretaker. [**Name (NI) 4906**]

CXR:
04/09/09Fall.
Mediastinum appears widened but is similar to previous portable
radiographs with similar positioning dating back to [**2186-4-28**]. Cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged. Near
complete collapse of right lower lobe is present with adjacent
small right pleural effusion. Improving opacity at the left
base, which is nearly resolved.
[**2186-5-2**] In comparison with the study of [**4-28**], the endotracheal
tube has been removed. The widening of the superior mediastinum
is somewhat less
pronounced. Bibasilar atelectasis and effusions persist.

Chest CT
[**4-28**]. No mediastinal hemorrhage. No evidence of vascular,
tracheal or
esophageal trauma.
2. Interval removal of tracheal stent with endotracheal tube in
place. No
change in tracheal thickening.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis.
[**4-25**] 1. Patchy opacity at the right and left lower lobes.
Appearance on the right particularly is concerning for
aspiration in light of recent bronchoscopy. Differential
includes atelectasis.
2. Markedly thickened trachea above patient's stent with
prominent
granulation tissue. Granulation tissue is also noted within the
stent. No
significant tracheomalacia.





Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2186-4-24**] for further airway management.
 On [**2186-4-25**] she was taken to the operating room for . Flexible
bronchoscopy. Rigid bronchoscopy.
Metal stent removal of proximal tracheal stent (alveolus4 cm).
She was monitored in the PACU prior transfer to the floor with
oxygen saturations 94% 3L NC. Aggressive pulmonary toilet with
nebs were continued. She had CT airway which showed marked
granulated tissue at stent site.  On [**2186-4-28**]  Successful
removal of distal tracheal stent. Significant residual
granulation tissue, nearly completely
obstructing tracheal lumen.  The patient remained intubated
overnight, to
undergo flexible bronchoscopy in the morning to reevaluate
airway mucosa and central airway obstruction. She was
transferred to SICU for further airway management.  On [**2186-4-29**]
she had a bedside bronchoscopy which showed improved airway.
Granulated tissue remained. She was  Extubated, with moderate
respiratory distress. Her respiratory status improved with
aggressive pulmonary toilet, BiPAP and Albuteral/atrovent nebs.
She transferred to the floor and her respiratory status slowly
returned to her baseline.  On [**5-2**] a follow-up flexible
bronchoscopy showed the distal trachea granulation tissue mainly
at the posterior wall. On [**5-3**] she slipped while getting out of
bed.  She was examined and no visual injury was noted.  She was
followed by serial chest x-ray which showed  a stable
Mediastinum widened. collapsed Right middle lobe and small
effusion.  She was followed by physical therapy.  The patients
respiratory status remained stable, she was observed for any
acute changes and on [**5-7**] was deemed fit for discharge back to
[**Location **]. AT the time of discharge the patient was
hemodynamically stable, her respiratory status was back to
baseline, she was tolerating a regular diet and did not have
significant pain complaints relating to her procedure.
