Chief Complaint:
chest pain, R sided weakness, Code Stroke


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
EGD


History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 57 y/o with a hx of MI (felt to be embolic, no CAD
on cath), CHF (EF 20-25%) s/p BiV pacer placement, recent admit
[**Date range (1) **] for L brachial artery and LA and LV clot in the
setting of holding Coumadin for pacer replacement, who presents
now as a Code Stroke for R sided weakness.  Code Stroke called
at
10:50, Neurology at the bedside at 10:55.

Per pt's wife, husband returned home from band practice late in
the evening.  He was in his USOH when he got home.  She was
talking with him in the kitchen aroun 10:20 when all of the
sudden he started clutching his chest and blanched and got
diaphoretic.  He said "I think something's happening to me!" and
looked at her like he was in shock and pain.  He was gasping for
breath, and went and sat down in a chair.  He gasped "aspirin!"
so his wife brought him an aspirin, which he took.  Then he
gasped "nitro!" so she brought him a nitro, which did not seem
to
help his pain.  She does not think that she noticed any slurred
speech, and he did not seem to have trouble understanding her or
talking to her, though he was not speaking much because he
seemed
preoccupied with the pain and seemed like he was having trouble
breathing.  She did not notice any weakness or facial droop.
She
became concerned and called EMS.

When EMS arrived they found him sitting in the chair.  His wife
thinks that he told them that something was wrong with his right
side.  EMS describes that he looked pale and diaphoretic, and
projectile vomited several times.  They felt that his right side
was weak, and when he stood he had trouble controlling his right
leg, and needed assistance in walking to the stretcher.  They
note that his L pupil was 1-2 mm larger than the right.  They
brought him directly to our ED.  He was intubated shortly after
arrival here because of concern for agitation and confusion, and
feeling that he would not tolerate CT scan without sedation.

Pt. was admitted to the cardiology service from [**Date range (1) **] for
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7388**].  This was identified on [**1-23**] when he presented to his
PCP with [**Name Initial (PRE) **] hand pain and swelling.  He was noted to have no L
radial pulse, and was referred here for CTA.  This showed a clot
in the L brachial artery, left atrium and left ventricle.  His
coumadin had been held from [**Date range (1) 104484**] for BiV pacer
replacement,
and INR was 1.8 on [**1-23**] when he was admitted.  In house
vascular
surgery was consulted and recommended medical management with
Heparin and Coumadin.  Heparin was continued until INR was at
goal on Coumadin (INR goal 2.5-3.5 per hematology, was 2.7 on
day
of discharge on [**1-27**])  Hematology was consulted re:
hypercoaguability.  They noted mildly elevated homocysteine in
the past.  They felt that given that he had evidence of both
arterial and venous thrombosis hyperhomocysteinemia,
anticardiolipin antibodies, or lupus anticoagulant were most
likely.  Prothrombin gene mutation, antithrombin III deficiency,
protein C and S deficiency, and factor V Leiden, were felt to be
less likely as they are more apt to cause venous thromboses.
Factor V leiden was sent and is still pending, prothrombin
mutation analysis is pending, and ACA was WNL.  Homocysteine was
normal at 10.1.  He was started on B12, folate, and B6, and
asked
to follow up with Hematology.  ATIII, Protein C and S were not
checked as he was already on anti-coagulation.

Imaging
CXR:
The right cardiophrenic angle has been excluded.  There has been
interval intubation, with ET tube terminating 5.1 cm above the
carina, at the level of the superior aspect of the clavicular
heads.  NG tube terminates within the stomach with sidehole not
clearly visualized.  Again seen is a left-sided pacemaker with
leads terminating in the right atrium and ventricle.  There are
abandoned pacemaker wires also in the same projection, in
unchanged position.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably
enlarged, with prominence of the left atrial appendage,
consistent with known left atrial appendage thrombus.  Streaky
opacities at the medial aspects of the lower lobes are
consistent
with atelectasis as seen on concurrent CTA, though overlying
infection cannot be excluded.  More rounded, fluffy, right
perihilar opacity may represent a focus of aspiration.  There is
no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval intubation with satisfactory position of the ET
tube
and NG tube.
2.  Bibasilar atelectasis, though superimposed infection cannot
be excluded.
3.  Small right perihilar opacity may represent aspiration.
4.  Prominence of the left atrial appendage consistent with
known
left atrial appendage thrombus.
<br>
CTA Head and Neck:
1. There is an area of reversible ischemia in the distribution
of the left posterior cerebral artery. There is no hemorrhage,
edema, masses, or mass effect.

2. Left atrial appendage thrombus is similar in appearance to
CTA chest performed [**2122-1-22**].

3. Right thyroid nodule can be further characterized on
ultrasound.
<br>
NCHCT [**2122-1-30**]:
 IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute vascular terretorial infarct
in an otherwise unremarkable CT head.
