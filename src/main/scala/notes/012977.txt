Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29250**] was admitted initially to the MICU with pneumonia
in the RLL requring high level of supplemental oxygen. He also
had a UTI. He had worsening of his renal function likely
secondary to worsening acute systolic heart failure and ATN. He
required vasopressors the first 48 hours of admission. He was
then trialed on lasix drip to remove fluid given he developed
flash plmonary edema. He was unresponsive to high doses of
diuretic. At this point his outpatient nephrologist and
cardiologist were contact[**Name (NI) **] and came by to see him. He was
intermitently somnolent at this point but able to relay during
lucid periods that he clearly would not want dialysis or further
invasive lines. He was given a final 24 hour period to respond
to aggressive diuretic regimen with no success. At this point
there was a family discussion with his daughter who is the HCP,
his wife and the decision was made to make him comfortable on a
morphine drip. He expired on [**2114-5-24**] at 0430 AM in a peaceful
setting.
