History of Present Illness:
68F who was camping in [**Location (un) 3844**] and went to bed around
1230am and was fine at that time. At approximately 230am she
awoke with a severe sudden onset headache and informed her
husband. She was nauseous and diaphoretic at that time but did
not vomit. She was taken to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital where she became
altered and was intubated for declining mental status and sirway
protection. She underwent a CT scan of the head which showed a
large left occipital IPH with intraventricular extension. While
at the OSH she was also noted to develop hypothermia and an
enlarging left pupil. She received mannitol, lasix, and decadron
and was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. She arrives
intubated and not sedated. Her left pupil was reported as 4mm
and NR upon arrival. Unable to obtain review of systems

Pertinent Results:
[**5-16**] CTA Head: FINDINGS: I concur with Dr.[**Name (NI) 88617**]
analysis, but also there is substantial expansion of the
hemorrhage, consisting of multiple new foci within the more
anterior aspect of the left temporal lobe, completely effacing
the left temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], likely accounting for her observation of
increasing mass effect.
CT angiography of the head reveals no area of hemodynamically
significant
stenosis or within the limitations of this technique, an
aneurysm or other
vascular malformation. There does not appear to be any
observable
pathological vascularity in the area of the hemorrhage. However,
it is to be acknowledged that the mass effect associated with
the hemorrhage could obscure pathological vessels, by reason of
compression of these structures.

[**5-16**] CT Head: Findings: There has been interval performance of a
left frontal-temporal crainectomy, resulting in reduction in the
extent of right sided subfalcine herniation.
There also appears to have been partial removal of the
hemorrhage, with
contiguous gas bubbles likely reflecting surgery in the left
parietal
component of the hemorrhage. No change in ventricular size is
seen, nor the extent of the intraventricular hemorrhage.

[**5-16**] CT Head: IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease of the midline shift to the right.
2. Slight increase of the extracranial fluid collection
overlying the
craniectomy site containing air and hemorrhage.
3. No acute territorial infarction, significant transtentorial
herniation or new foci of intracranial hemorrhage.

[**5-18**] Chest CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Smooth interlobular septal thickening with ground-glass
opacities of
aerated lungs, compatible with pulmonary edema. Neurogenic
pulmonary edema is considered, given the patient's clinical
history of recent intracranial
hemorrhage.
3. Large dependent right upper lobe and bilateral lower lobe
consolidations could reflect dependent edema, but coexisting
aspiration pneumonia should be considered.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**5-19**] Head CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. No change in appearance of large left parietal and occipital
intraparenchymal hematomas, blood layering along the tentorial
leaflets, with an intraventricular extension. There is no
evidence of new hemorrhage or new large vascular territorial
infarction.
2. Minimal transgaleal herniation in the posterior aspect of the
craniectomy site.
3. Slight increase in rightward shift of midline structures.

[**5-21**] Gastric biopsy pathology:
Acute, ulcerative gastritis with numerous broad, ribbon-like,
non-septate hyphal forms morphologically compatible with
zygomycosis. PAS-D and GMS stains demonstrate the ribbon-like
fungal hyphal forms previously seen on H&E-stained sections.

[**5-22**] MRI Cspine:
Multilevel degenerative disease.
At C4-5, minimal retrolisthesis and a posterior endplate
osteophyte ridge
result in flattening of the ventral spinal cord and moderate
spinal canal
narrowing. Uncovertebral and facet arthropathy results in
approximately
moderate bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.

At C5-6, there is a posterior endplate osteophyte ridge, greater
on the left, with flattening of the left ventral spinal cord and
moderate narrowing of the left aspect of the spinal canal. There
are uncovertebral osteophytes resulting in approximately
moderate neural foraminal narrowing, worse on the left.

[**5-23**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of
a slow
background with bursts of generalized slowing which represents a

moderate encephalopathy and a left frontal breach rhythm due to
skull
defect. There were frequent left frontal central epileptiform
discharges, often appeared as prolonged PLEDs at 1 Hz for the
majority
of the recording, indicative of highly epileptogenic cortex.
However,
there was evolution of these discharges to suggest discrete
electrographic seizures.

[**5-24**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No other sites of infection identified within the abdomen and
pelvis.
Possible gastric wall thickening in the fundus vs. retained food
should be
correlated with recent EGD.
2. Improved bibasilar atelectasis with increased moderate-sized
bilateral
pleural effusions and persistent mild pulmonary edema.

[**5-24**] MRI Brain:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute/sub-acute infarct involving the splenium of corpus
callosum
secondary to posterior pericallosal vascular compromise from
herniation.
Punctate focus of possible slow diffusion in the right parietal
white matter suggesting a tiny infarct.
1. Slight interval increase in the size of fluid overlying the
craniectomy
site. No interval change in the shift of midline structures.
2. Large left parietal and occipital hematomas are
redemonstrated with blood overlying the tentorium and blood in
the lateral ventricles.
3. Interval increase in mucosal thickening and fluid in the left
mastoid air cells and new mild inflammatory changes in the right
mastoid air cells, sphenoid sinuses, and maxillary sinuses.

[**5-24**] CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No other sites of infection identified within the abdomen and
pelvis.
Possible gastric wall thickening in the fundus vs. retained food
should be
correlated with recent EGD.
2. Improved bibasilar atelectasis with increased moderate-sized
bilateral
pleural effusions and persistent mild pulmonary edema.

[**5-24**] EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG due to the presence of
a slow
background which represents a moderate encephalopathy and
generalized
delta frequency slowing which represents deep midline
dysfunction. The
left hemisphere showed persistently increased amplitude and
sharper
contours indicative of a breach rhy
