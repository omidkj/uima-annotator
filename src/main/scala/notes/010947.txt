Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intra-abdmonial abscess drainage

History of Present Illness:
68 yo male with history of PE, recurrent bowel obstructions, a
fib who was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for worsening respiratory
distress.

Pt initially presented to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital on [**2160-11-6**]
for elective abdominal wall reconstruction and lysis of
adhesions given multiple recurrences of bowel obstructions. Pt
did well following procedure and was on zosyn post-operatively.
On [**2160-11-11**], pt developed respiratory distress. CXR showed
possible LLL pneumonia. He was started on moxifloxicin. CTA
showed no evidence PE. Pt initially improved, however on [**11-16**]
pt had episode of tachycardia to 130-140s associated wtih
increased respiratory distress. Given worsening renal status, pt
was evaluated with V/Q scan which again showed no evidence of
PE. The following day, CT abdomen showed ilieus with no bowel
obstruction and LLL pneumonia. Sputum cultures returned positive
on [**11-18**] for Klebsiella and the patient was noted to be febrile.
He was continued on moxifloxicin. Repeat CT scan did not show
e/o abscess or other intra-abdominal source. On [**11-19**], WBC
increased from 11.9-->22.4 and the patient was febrile. Repeat
CXR showed worsening LLL consolidation. On [**11-24**], WBC count
peaked at 35.1, sputum grew yeast, MRSA and klebsiella. Abx were
changed to ticarcillin and diflucan. Given a penicillin allergy,
he was changed from ticarcillin to tigecyclin. On morning of
[**11-25**], pt was intubated for worsening respiratory failure. He
was started on Vancomycin, underwent bronchoscopy and
transferred here on [**11-26**].

Studies:
.
ECHO [**11-26**] - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis [**11-30**] - IMPRESSION: 1. Rim enhancing,
air-containing fluid collection in the lower abdomen / upper
pelvis. Although this collection was present on [**11-24**], the rim
enhancement and gas are new and concerning for abscess. Despite
proximity to old small bowel anastamosis, no extravasation or
oral contrast. The location is ammenable for CT guided drainage.
Two smaller rim-enhancing collections below the liver and in the
pelvis are not suitable for drainage. 2. Common bile duct
dilation with a smooth taper towards the pancreatic head.
Differential enhancement of the pancreatic head and punctate
calcifications are consistent with sequela prior acute or
chronic pancreatitis.  3. Persistent pneumonia with improved
aeration of the left lower lobe.
.
CT Sinus [**11-20**] - IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive paranasal sinus
disease is likely secondary to both chronic sinusitis and
patient's recent intubation. While there is no definite evidence
of acute sinusitis, this diagnosis cannot be excluded. 2.
Complete obstruction of the left maxillary sinus.
.

CT chest [**12-5**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Collapse of the right lower quadrant abdominal collection
with a sliver of remaining fluid and drainage catheter located
within.
2. Unchanged appearance to tiny pelvic and subhepatic fluid
collections.
3. Slightly improved multifocal ground glass opacities likely
reflect
infectious process with improved aeration in left lower lobe.
4. Hypodensities in the pancreatic head could reflect prominent
side
branches, and if indicated can be assessed by MRI.

.
CT chest [**12-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Prominent main pulmonary artery, again suggesting underlying
pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
3. Multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities,
demonstrating
variable progression and improvement compared to [**2160-12-5**], as detailed above. These remain most consistent with
multifocal pneumonia.
4. Secretions within the trachea, suggesting aspiration.
5. Coronary artery calcifications.
6. Trace pleural effusions.
.
CT Abdomen: IMPRESSION: 1. Slight interval reexpansion of a
right lower quadrant fluid collection. Decreased subhepatic and
perirectal fluid collections. 2. Mildly improved bilateral
bibasilar multifocal opacities compatible with a resolving
pneumonia. Small left pleural effusion increased since [**12-9**], [**2160**]. 3. Stable slight intrahepatic biliary duct dilation. 4.
Bilateral renal cysts, stable. 5. IVC filter.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 49985**] is a 68 year-old man transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with
pneumonia and worsening respiratory failure s/p intubation.
.
Hospital Course
-----------
The patient was admitted at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital from
[**2160-11-6**] until [**2160-11-26**], initially for an elective surgery and
subsequently for a worsening pneumonia. Sputum cultures there
were ploymicrobial including klebsiella/yeast/MRSA implicating
aspiration as a possible etiology. On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient was intubated and on a high level of FiO2. He was
initially continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin,
cefepime, flagyl). On HOD #1, the patient was hypotensive.  A
central line was placed and levophed started. Tobramycin was
added for double pseudomonal cov
