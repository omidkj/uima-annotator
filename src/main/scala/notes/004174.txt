Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for ?peritonitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placement [**3-3**]
Central Catheter placement and d/c (R IJ)


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from OSH
for evaluation of possible acute abdomen. Of note, the patient
recently completed 28 days of IV Ceftriaxone for CNS lyme on
[**2-20**]. She initially presented to an OSH on [**2-24**] with rash and
fever. She also had chills, nausea and vomiting. In the OSH ED
she was found to be tachy with HR 133 and temp 101. Her BP was
as low as 90 and responded to IVF. WBC was 11.9 with 22% bands.
CXR showed a R hilar infiltrate. A RIJ was placed and she was
admitted to the ICU for presumed line sepsis from her PICC. She
was given vanc/levo. Blood cultures were checked x3 and were
NGTD. Her levo was discontinued and her vanco was continued for
3 days. Dermatology was consulted for ? of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) **],
however drug rxn was felt to be more likely. She was started on
solumedrol 80mg q8hr which has been tapered down to 60mg q12. On
[**3-1**] the patient was noted to be hypoxic to 88% with ambulation.
CTA confirmed LUL PE and she was started on [**Month/Year (2) 80809**] 7.5mg daily.
CT also showed bilateral lower lobe PNA and pleural effusions.
.
At 3am on the morning of transfer the patient developed sudden
onset, severe abdominal pain and cramps. She describes it as a
severe gas pain. She then had 4-5 episodes of emesis of greenish
material, denies blood. At 7am she was found on the floor with a
BP of 73/53 and O2 sat 88%. She was placed on NRB and given
250cc NS and BP improved to 90/50. CT neck was neg. for
fracture. Exam showed diffusely tender abdomen with guarding and
rebound. CT abdomen showed an inflammatory mass in the pancreas,
free fluid and ? free air. WBC at that time was 20.8. The
patient does not recall the events leading up to the fall and
remembers waking up on the floor.
.
Currently, the patient reports that her abdominal pain is
improved after she received morphine. She reports that the pain
is diffuse, continues to feel like bad gas. Up until yesterday
she was passing gas, however she has not today. She also reports
having diarrhea 3 days ago with 4-5 loose stools/day. She has
had some SOB since her admission and reports that her breathing
is improved today. She denies cough. She reports having low
grade fevers at OSH. She feels that her rash is significantly
improved. ROS is otherwise negative.

CT Torso [**3-2**]:
There is a high attenuation, presumably hemorrhage centered
around the third and fourth portions of the duodenum in the
retroperitoneum. This does not appear to be arising from the
pancreas. There is contact of this high- attenuation fluid with
the uncinate process, but otherwise, the remainder and majority
of the pancreas is uninvolved and normal. It is presumed that
this extensive hemorrhage extends into the intraperitoneal space
and the pelvis where the high-attenuation foci along the left
paracolic gutter are presumed clots. No obstruction is
identified. There is no free air. This case was discussed at
length with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], general surgery, in person and with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 429**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], general surgery, over the phone. Diagnostic
considerations include a vascular injury (gastroduodenal artery)
secondary to ulcer in the distal duodenum (atypical). Diagnostic
considerations also may center around
a spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage as further history
obtained revealed recent anticoagulation.

LENI [**3-3**]:
No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremity.
<br>

[**3-3**] EGD:

Findings: Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum:
 Mucosa: A 3cm area of erythema and edema was seen in the third
part of the duodenum. Centered in it, a 2mm ulcer with small
cover of red blood but no active bleeding was seen.
Impression: Small duodenal ulcer.
Otherwise normal EGD to Fourth part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Findings discussed with Promary MICU team and
with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], Surgery.
Continue [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
Check H.pylori serology. Eradicate as outpatient if positive.
Additional notes: The attending physician was present during the
entire procedure.
