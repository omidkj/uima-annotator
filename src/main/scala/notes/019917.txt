Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
89 yo F with dementia, paroxysmal A Fib, CHF and past PE
admitted with shortness of breath, being treated for CHF
exacerbation transferred to the ICU with a fib with RVR and
relative hypotension.
.
The patient initialy presented from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2201-2-21**]
with wheezing and dyspnea. She denied and continues to deny any
cardiac symptoms, including chest pain, orthopnea, PND. The
pateint no signs of ischemia on EKG and negative cardiac
enzymes. In the setting of JVP elevation and BNP >5000, the
patient was treated for a presumed CHF exacerbation. The patient
was successfully diuresed -700-800 mL overnight with 40mg IV
furosemide x2. On [**2201-2-22**] around 4PM, the patient went into A
Fib with a rate of 120-140's. Her systolic blood pressure
declined in the new rhythm from sbp of 160's to sbp 100's. The
patient received a bolus of 5mg IV metoprolol with improvement
in HR to 110's. She then received another 2.5mg IV metoprolol
and bp declined to 80/60. The patient was bolused with 750ml NS
with return of sbp to 110s. She received another 2.5mg IV
metoprolol plus an additional 12.5mg PO with HR persistently in
the 110-130 range. The patient developed an increased oxygen
requirement to 96% on 3L (originally on 1-2L NC). She was
transitioned to diltiazem 30mg four times daily PO with
maintenance of sbp in the 100's and HR in the 110's. Diltiazem
was increased to 60mg four times daily PO with HRs in the 90's
to 130's, SBP 90's to 100's. The patient is DNR. She is
transferred for initiation of amiodarone +/- diltiazem gtt for
management of a fib with RVR and relative hypotension.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2201-2-21**]): No acute process; specifically, there is no
evidence of
significant CHF.
.
TTE ([**2201-2-24**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate to severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. IMPRESSION: Mild LVH with
preserved left ventricular systolic function. Moderate diastolic
dysfunction with elevated LV filling pressures. Dilated right
ventricle with normal systolic function. Moderate to severe
pulmonary hypertension. Mild aortic and mitral valve
regurgitation. Moderate left atrial enlargement.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 yo F with dementia, paroxysmal A Fib, diastolic CHF and
past PE admitted with shortness of breath, being treated for CHF
exacerbation transferred to the ICU with a fib with RVR and
relative hypotension.
.
# Pump. Known diastolic CHF with pulmonary hypertension and 2+
TR. The patient presented with acute on chronic shortness of
breath and heart failure symptoms. On exam she had JVP
elevation, profound peripheral edema and BNP>5000 all concerning
for heart failure. CXR did not convincingly reveal pulmonary
edema. The patient was aggressively and successfully diuresed
with IV Lasix. Over the course of her hospitalization she was
negative >10L. Echo during this hospitalization was suggestive
of moderate diastolic failure with mod-severe pulmonary
hypertension. At the time of discharge, the patient was
restarted on standing PO Lasix and was told to adhere to a low
salt diet and to weigh herself daily. She was told to alert her
doctor for any increase in weight greater than or equal to 3
lbs. The patient was given a prescription for basic metabolic
panel monitoring to be drawn at her outpatient follow-up
appointment. Will continue reduced Lasix dose of 80mg daily,
defer further management to PCP and Cardiologist.
.
# A Fib. The patient was known to have a history of A Fib. In
the setting of volume overload the patient developed a fib with
RVR to a rate of 120-140. She did not tolerate this rapid rhythm
well and had relative hypotension to the high 90's to low 100's
systolic. The patient failed trials of metoprolol and diltiazem
for rate control. Due to tenuous blood pressure decline, the
patient was transferred to the CCU for further care. The patient
was loaded on amiodarone. She converted to NSR and then went
back into a fib with RVR. She was loaded with procainamide and
again converted to NSR and then back into a fib with RVR. Given
that her initial amiodarone load was approximately 4g, she was
reloaded with an additional several grams. She converted back to
NSR and continued in this rhythm with brief bursts of atrial fib
with RVR (for seconds at a time) for the remaining three days of
her hospitalization. At the time of discharge, patient had
remained in NSR for >24 hours. The patient will continue on
amiodarone maintenance dosing at 200mg daily. Due to hypotension
associated with beta-blocker dosing (and ineffectiveness at rate
control) the patient's home beta-blocker was discontinued. She
was started on Diltiazem XR and magnesium supplementation. The
patient was admitted and continued on therapeutic systemic
anticoagulation with
