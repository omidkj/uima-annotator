History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 67 y/o F with a recent diagnosis of DVT/PE after a
trip to [**Country 2559**] who re-presented to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital one day after
discharge with increasing shortness of breath.
.
During her trip to [**Country 2559**] over two weeks ago she had to cut her
vacation short due to worsening shortness of breath and extreme
fatigue.  When she returned from her trip she presented to
[**Hospital 4199**] Hospital.  During that admission she was diagnosed with
a DVT, unable to get a CTA initially due to her Cr on admission,
but then found to have a PE, was started on heparin gtt as a
bridge to coumadin.  She was then discharged home on coumadin
2mg daily, but after being home for only one night she returned
to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital complaining of worsening shortness of
breath.  At that time she was complaining of dyspnea on
exertion, and "inability to catch her breath" but denied any
chest pain, palpitations, n/v, orthopnea, PND, fever/chills,
cough, sore throat or nasal congestion.
.
At the time of her repeat admission a chest CT was done that
showed a multifocal pneumonia, loculated left pleural effusion,
along with mediastinal, axillary and supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy, she was diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia
superimposed on her known pulmonary embolism.  At that time she
was also noted to have an INR of 7.3, white count of 16.6,
albumin of 2.8, with flat cardiac enzymes, found to be hypoxic
placed on a NRB.  She was initially admitted to the ICU, where
her INR was reversed with vitamin K and FFP so she could undergo
a thoracentesis.  The thoracentesis fluid was reportedly
exudative, cultures showed no growth and no malignant cells were
seen.  Her pneumonia was treated with vancomycin and ertapenem,
with improvement in her respiratory symptoms.  A urine
legnionella was negative, sputum Gram stain showed GPC's in
clusters, but the culture grew out oropharyngeal flora.  She was
also diuresed with some improvement in her respiratory symptoms.

.
Also during her stay at [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital she was found to have
elevated troponins with flat CK and CK-MB.  She was seen by
cardiology who felt that this did not represent an acute
coronary syndrome but likely was demand due to her clot burden
from her PE's.  She was also found to have elevated LFT's and a
dropping HCT, for which she was seen by GI who recommended a CT
scan of her abdomen/pelvis which showed a gallstone, small
amount of perinephric fluid.  Her LFT's improved without further
intervention, they also felt that she was not having a GI bleed,
but given the anemia they were concerned that she could have an
underlying malignancy.  Also 24 hours prior to discharge she was
found to have runs of SVT, for which she was seen by cardiology
and her atenolol was increased to 125mg daily.  Given the
concern about the lymphadenopathy on CT scan and development of
intermittent SVT, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
On the floor, her initial VS were: 98.2, 75, 148/82, 16, 92% on
4LNC.  She says that she currently feels well, denies any
fever/chills, CP, SOB, n/v/d, cough, congestion, she says that
compared to how she felt on admission she feels about 100%
better.

CXR ([**2197-5-18**])
Left PICC line tip terminates at the level of low SVC. The heart
size is
enlarged. Mediastinum is normal in width. There is evidence of
mild
interstitial pulmonary edema. There are also bilateral pleural
effusions.
Left lower lobe consolidation is noted, rounded and might
represent a
combination of atelectasis and infectious process, should be
further followed. There is also questionable cavitary lesion in
the right upper lobe projecting over the posterior aspect of the
sixth rib. It might also represent a bone finding (anterior end
of the first rib). As for precise evaluation of this area,
shallow obliques are recommended. If the finding is demonstrated
to be in the lungs, further evaluation with a CT of the chest
with older findings is highly recommended.

Abdomen US ([**2197-5-19**])
Bilateral pleural effusions. No evidence of bile duct
dilatation. Normal liver.   Cholelithiasis and 7-mm gallbladder
polyp are noted. Followup imaging of the polyp is recommended in
12 months, due to size of 7 mm.
