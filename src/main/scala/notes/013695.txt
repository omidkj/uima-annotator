Admission Date:  [**2197-11-2**]       Discharge Date:


Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 78-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
catheterization in [**2182**] and repeat catheterization on
[**2197-10-31**].  At that time, he was stented in his proximal left
anterior descending and was discharged home later that night,
developed one episode of syncope and dizziness, and presented
to the Emergency Department with those complaints.

The patient had a routine stress echocardiogram done by his
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2197-10-12**], which demonstrated five
minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol which was stopped for fatigue and
shortness of breath without chest pain.  He demonstrated 2 to
[**Street Address(2) 2051**] depressions in the inferolateral area, mild mitral
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, trace aortic
insufficiency and posterior inferior as well as septal
ischemia.

The patient was referred for catheterization at [**Hospital6 11896**], which demonstrated two vessel disease, a
70% left anterior descending and a total right.  The patient
was brought to [**Hospital1 69**] for
intervention on [**10-31**].  He was stented in his proximal left
anterior descending, and discharged home the next day, as he
was clinically stable.

His electrocardiogram prior to his intervention in [**Month (only) 547**]
demonstrated a normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature
ventricular contractions.  Post-procedure on [**10-31**], the
patient demonstrated a right bundle branch block pattern with
Type I conduction delay.  On the night of the 7th, the day
after the intervention, the patient developed one episode of
syncope and dizziness when trying to leave the bathroom.  He
returned to bed and had no other episodes of syncope or
dizziness over the course of the evening.

The next day, the patient presented to the hospital on [**11-2**]
with complaints of dizziness, no shortness of breath, no
chest pain, and no other complaints.  The patient's
electrocardiogram demonstrated complete heart block at that
time.  His blood pressure was 98/64.  His heart rate was 45,
wide complex rhythm, and the patient had an oxygen saturation
of 98% on 2 liters of oxygen at that time.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination was significant
for jugular venous pressure of approximately 8 cm.  He had
bibasilar rales and 2+ pulses throughout.  The abdominal
examination was benign.  His cardiac examination was regular
and bradycardic, with a normal S1 and S2.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC:  White count 9.2, hemoglobin and
hematocrit 10.6/31.5, platelets 335.  Chem 7:
138/4.5/104/25/34/1.4/116.  Coags were normal.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated complete heart block on his
first electrocardiogram and his third electrocardiogram while
still in the Emergency Department demonstrated a 2:1 heart
block with a left bundle branch morphology.  CK on admission
was 159, MB was 15, troponin was 15.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was brought to the Coronary
Care Unit for continued monitoring for low blood pressure.
At that time, a temporary pacemaker wire was inserted in the
right groin without complication.  The following day, the
patient went to catheterization to evaluate whether his left
anterior descending stent remained patent, and it did.  No
other changes were noted on coronary angiography.

Later that day, the patient had a pacemaker placed, a
permanent one.  The patient had a DDD-type pacemaker placed.
After the permanent pacemaker was placed, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable, with blood pressures in the
110s/60s and heart rates in the 90s and low 100s.  However,
over the course of the next few days, the patient developed
increasing oxygen requirements with 5 liters oxygen nasal
cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%.
The patient continued to feel fatigued and, on two different
episodes, experienced syncope when arising from a seated
position.

Due to the patient's increasing respiratory distress as well
as crackles in his lung fields halfway to three-quarters of
the way up his posterior lung fields, the patient was
aggressively diuresed with intravenous lasix as needed as
well as afterload-reducing agents started with Captopril 6.25
and titrated up to Captopril 25 three times a day.  However,
after a three day course of diuretics and afterload
reduction, the patient continued to have unchanged
respiratory distress and, on chest x-ray, what appeared to be
pulmonary edema that was unresponsive to diuretic therapy as
well as afterload reduction.  An echocardiogram was performed
to evaluate whether the patient had underlying diastolic
dysfunction that could be contributing to his pulmonary
edema.  An echocardiogram was performed which demonstrated an
ejection fraction of greater than 60%, no systolic
dysfunction was noted, no left ventricular hypertrophy was
noted.  The patient, however, was noted to have left
ventricular wall stiffness with decreased left ventricular
filling, which was consistent with diastolic dysfunction.

At that time, a beta blocker was started, Lopressor 12.5 mg
by mouth twice a day, and was titrated up to a dose of 75 mg
three times a day over the course of the next two to three
days to improve diastolic filling time by slowing the heart
rate, however, this treatment has not demonstrated
significant improvement in the patient's chest x-ray or
physical examination or his respiratory distress.

Because of his continued oxygen requirements as well as his
desaturation into the high 70s to low 80s with any exertion,
the patient was seen by Pulmonary for an evaluation as to the
etiology of his slowly progressive but new onset shortness of
breath and respiratory distress.  A CT was taken on [**11-10**] to
further evaluation his pulmonary status.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Complete heart block

The patient's medications, as well as follow up and discharge
date will all be dictated by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 915**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 916**].
