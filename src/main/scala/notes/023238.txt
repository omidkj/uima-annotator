History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 87311**] is a 71 year old female with a PMH significant for
SLE on chronic steroids, COPD, CVA, DM 2, and multiple
admissions for left subdiaphragmatic abscess s/p exlap with
diverting ileostomy complicated by prolonged mechanical
ventilation, volume overload, and watershed CVA with residual
weakness discharged to rehab on broad spectrum antimicoribals
re-admitted for altered mental status found to be in status
epilepticus.
.
The patient initially presented in [**7-1**] for fevers and rigors
and was found to have a subdiaphragmatic abscess and underwent
IR drain placement with cultures demonstrating polymicrobial
growth including Bacteroides and pan-sensitive Pseudomonas
treated with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and fluconazole
subsequently changed to amox/clav.  She was readmitted in
mid-[**Month (only) 216**] for persistent nausea, and cultures then demonstrated
polymicrobial growth with budding yeast speciated as [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Krusei. On [**7-16**], she underwent open left colectomy
with colorectal anastamosis and diverting loop ileostomy, with
stool noted in the abscess. Of note, no cultures were sent from
the OR.  Her post-operative course was then complicated by a
prolonged [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay for volume overload requiring mechanical
ventilation and a left-sided watershed CVA, and was ultimately
discharged to rehab on [**2160-8-13**] with persistent weakness on
vanco, meropenem, and micafungin with plan for continuation of
antibiotics for at least 7 days after drain was pulled.
.
The patient was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the [**Last Name (un) **]-rectal
service on [**8-16**] for altered mental status. Her current hospital
course has been notable for intermintent delirium described as
being ambulatory to being difficult to control. Two nights ago,
she received 12.5 trazodone, and EEG yesterday was noted to have
persistent epileptiform activity concerning for status
epilepticus. Neuro is following, and the patient has received a
total of 1500 mg fosphenytoin with most recent trough pending
and standing ativan Q6H.  Cultures during this admission
including blood and urine have been NGTD.  Of note, PICC line
placed during prior admission has not yet been removed.  The
patient also underwent CTAP on [**8-18**] with stable RUQ fluid
collection, midline fluid collection, and improvement in LUQ
fluid collection.  LUQ drain was subsequently removed, and CT
guided aspiration of midline and RUQ fluid collections
unsuccessful. Also of note, the patient also developed a new 3L
O2 requirement yesterday.  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] transfer requested for status
epilepticus and fevers.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 87311**] is a 71 year old female with a PMH significant for
SLE on chronic steroids, COPD, CVA, DM2, and multiple admissions
for left sub-diaphragmatic abscess s/p exlap with diverting
ileostomy complicated by prolonged mechanical ventilation,
volume overload, and watershed CVA with residual weakness
discharged to rehab on broad spectrum antibiotics re-admitted
for altered mental status found to be in status epilepticus with
multiple strokes on MRI.
.
# Status epilepticus: Extubated successfully. No seizure
activity since [**8-22**] at 18:00.  Likely secondary to chronic or
new infarcts seen on MRI (ischemic vs. embolic from carotids vs.
lupus vasculitis). Changed anti-epileptic meds to PO, dosing per
neuro. On discharge the patient is on 200mg of Phenytoin
(Suspension) every 8 hours at set times. She will need a
dilantin level on [**2160-9-21**] with an albumin for a corrected
dilantin level.

# Stroke: TEE ruled out endocarditis. Also multiple strokes and
seizure bring up the possibility of a CNS vasculitic etiology
such as lupus cerebritis or ACLA syndrome ?????? lupus anticoagulant
positive which explains hypercoaguability. Anti-cardiolipin
IgG/IgM pending. C3/C4 wnl, dsDNA negative. Neuro recommends
anticoagulation then d/c plavix (surgery okay with this).
Carotid dopplers showed no change from prior.  LENI??????s negative.
Heparin started [**8-27**] with plan to bridge to coumadin.  However,
given no IV access in the ICU was changed to plavix bridge to
Coumadin. The patient had been therapeutic on the inpatient [**Hospital1 **]
with a goal INR of [**12-26**], Had been therapeutic however since
[**2160-9-8**] we have needed to titrate the Warfarin dose. Neurology
agreed that it was appropriate to start the patient on 325mg of
Aspirin Therapy daily and continue Coumadin. Today on discharge
her INR is 1.8 and she is written to recieve 7.5 mg of Warfarin
today [**2160-9-18**] which is an increase from [**2160-9-17**] when she
recieved 5mg of Warfarin for an INR of 1.4.  She will need a
repeat PT/INR on [**2160-9-19**] for dose adjustment. Please see
neurology note attached to this summary for further details.

# Fever/leukocytosis:  leukocytosis 11.3 and 13.2. Potential
sources include: evolving pneumonia, abdominal source given
recent history and temporal association with drain removal. TEE
negative for endocarditis, and HSV PCR neg.  Vancomycin,
Meropenem, and Micafungin discontinued on [**8-27**]. The patient was
noted to have some increased adjitation and a urinalysis and
urine culture was sent on [**2160-9-9**] which showed possible VRE,
infectious disease was consulted and it seemed as though the
specimen was possibly contaminated, her foley catheter was
removed and a repeat UA was then sent which again showed
enterococus. It was decided that at the recommendation of
infectious disease to give the patient a one time dose of
fofomycin 3gm by mouth and follow-up in 48 hours with a
urinalysis and culture. On discharge urinalysis continued to
show small amount bacteria moderate leukocytes. The patient was
started on linezolid by mouth for possible VRE in
