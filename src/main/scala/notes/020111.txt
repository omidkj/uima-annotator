History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 55 y/o man with history of non-hodgkin's
lymphoma with recently diagnosed recurrences who re-presents to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after being found with oxygen saturations of 88% on 6L
NC. The patient was discharged from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the BMT floor at
approximately 5:00 pm; at that time, the patient's oxygen
saturations were 95% on 2L NC. He was doing well on the floor
until he got up to use his urinal at about midnight. At that
time, tha patient was found to be hypoxic to 88% on 6L NC. His
saturations improved to 90-91% on NRB. He was noted to have
received about 200 cc of IV fluids; on exam, he was diffusely
wheezing. EKG demonstrated NSR at 80, rSr', no significant ST/T
wave changes from prior. CXR at the time demonstrated increased
bilateral opacities, worse since [**2184-8-15**]. The patient received 20
mg IV lasix on the floor and urinated about 550 cc prior to
moving down to the ICU. After receiving lasix, the patient's
saturations improved to 96% on NRB.
.
He was originally admitted on [**2184-8-11**] as a transfer from OSH with
recurrence of disease. At that time, he was initiated on hyper
CVAD chemotherapy. The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course has been
complicated by tumor lysis syndrome which has been treated with
aggressive IV fluids. Bone marrow biopsy done on [**8-12**]
demonstrated large B cell lymphoma; TTE was done on [**8-13**] in
preparation for chemo, which was normal (no LVH, though E wave
decel time upper limit of normal giving ? to diastolic
dysfunction). On [**8-13**], he experienced onset of new AF with RVR.
Metoprolol was gradually uptitrated but he experienced
increasing dyspnea. A chest CT was done, which demonstrated
multifocal bilateral upper lobe, RML, and superior segment LLL
ground glass opacities with diffuse peribronchial thickening.
There was also interlobular septal thickening at the right base,
and small bilateral effusions with ddx including pulmonary
edema, DAH, and infection. He was empirically treated with vanc,
levo, and voriconazole. On the evening of [**8-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 5395**]
continued to be tachycardic to 140s in AF despite up-titration
of metoprolol to 100mg PO. BP remained stable in 160s/100s. He
was noted to have crackles and elevated JVP on exam, and was
experiencing gradually worsening dyspnea. At that time, he was
diuresed with 20 mg IV lasix and sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where
bronchoscopy demonstrated previous pulmonary hemorrhage but no
active bleeding. He was diuresed effectively and actually
converted out of afib while on diltiazem gtt. At the time of
transfer back to the flor, the patient was comfortable on 3 L NC
with oxygen saturations in the mid 90s.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient states that his breathing is
more comfortable than approximately 30 minutes prior. He also
notes that his bladder feels full and he has to urinate. He
otherwise denies chest pain, abdomina pain, dizziness,
lightheadedness, worsened lower extremity edema, nausea, and
vomiting.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:

[**8-12**] MRI HEAD
HISTORY: 55-year-old man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with tumor
lysis syndrome, and now numbness of the right jaw concerning for
cranial nerve involvement.

TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1; axial post-gadolinium T1, T2, FLAIR,
DWI, DTI of the head as well as axial 3-mm T1, post-gadolinium
T1 with fat sat, T2; coronal T2 with fat-sat and post-gadolinium
T1 with fat-sat images of the skull base were obtained.

FINDINGS: Correlation is made to MR of the cervical spine from
an outside hospital dated [**2184-8-11**].

The visualized skull base appears normal with no areas of
abnormal enhancement. No abnormalities of the mandible,
masticator space, parapharyngeal space, or infratemporal fossa
are seen. The visualized oral cavity, oropharynx, and
nasopharynx are normal. The right inferior turbinate is not
seen, which may be due to prior surgical resection.

There is minimal mucosal thickening involving the maxillary
sinuses and ethmoid air cells.

There is no abnormal enhancement of the visualized cranial
nerves. Meckel's caves and cavernous sinuses appear normal.
There are no areas of slow diffusion. Visualized major flow
voids are normal. The ventricles and extraaxial CSF spaces are
normal.

There are a few scattered T2 hyperintense foci of the
subcortical and deep white matter, which may represent small
vessel ischemic changes.

There is decreased T1 signal of the visualized bone marrow of
the calvarium and cervical spine which is a nonspecific finding
but may represent involvement by lymphoma or marrow
reconversion.

There appears to be a left medial orbital wall blowout fracture.

IMPRESSION: No abnormal enhancement of the visualized cranial
nerves. No abnormalities of the mandible or skull base are seen.
.
[**8-14**] CXR: Progression of bilateral airspace and interstitial
opacities, at least a component of which likely represents
hydrostatic edema given associated cardiovascular changes.
Coexisting infection, hemorrhage or drug reaction is also
possible in the setting of lymphoma.
.
[**8-13**] CT chest w/o contrast: 1.  Multifocal ground-glass
opacities involving the both upper lobes, right middle lobe and
superior segment of left lower lobe measuring up to 3.7 cm, with
diffuse peribronchial thickening and pleural effusion and
mediastinal and paraaortic nodes as described above.
Differential diagnosis include alveolar hemorrhage in the
presence of hemoptysis, infectious process in the appropriate
clinical setting, with etiology including both viral and
bacteria, or atypical multifocal pulmonary edema given rapid
appearance and septal
thickening and effusion. Further clinical correlation and close
follow up is recommended.
2. Diffuse high density of the liver, could represent
hemosiderosis or hemachromatosis, or amiodarone accumulation.
3.  Bilateral nonobstructing renal stones.
.
[**8-13**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.
.
ECG: NSR at 80s, normal axis, normal intervals, rSr' in V1, no
significant ST-T wave changes compared to two prior EKGS
(however both prior in a fib)
