Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ranitidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain/shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization [**2167-1-20**]

History of Present Illness:
69M CAD s/p CABG in [**2152**], DM2, CKD on HD, radiation cystitis
complicated by enterococcal UTI ([**1-21**]) and history of
enterococcal endocarditis presenting with chest pain and dyspnea
on exertion for several weeks responsive to nitroglycerin. He
noticed that pain occasionally radiated to bilateral arms. He
denies fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting. He also denies PND or
orthopnea.
Patient was due for outpatient c. cath on Thursday with his
cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He was advised to present to the ED
given increased frequency and intensity of chest discomfort. He
initially presented to OSH and was transferred here due to
cardiology care here. He states that the reason why he came
today was that he usually uses oxygen at HD sessions, but his
doctor told him that he can't do that on a regular basis. It was
also ascertained that for the past 3 weeks that he was using
[**8-21**] SLNTGs a day for chest discomfort occuring both at rest and
with exertion. This represents increased frequency of his
symptoms - intensity has been the same.
Of note, he also was complained about needing oxygen and
subsequently is doing well on 3 L NC. He does endorse some chest
congestion now.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 22:34 0 98.1 91 101/51 18 100% 3L.
ECG showed SR at 95 bpm with lateral ST depression and no STEMI.
There were some dynamic depressions in V4-V5 while patient was
chest pain free on arrival here.
OSH labs at 8 PM showing WBC 6.3, Hgb 12.4, Plt 156. Chemistry
panel was Na 134, K 3.7, Cl 90, HCO3 30, BUN 35, Cr 2.8 and
Glucose 132. Troponin I was 0.03.
A bedside ECHO in the ER showed no effusion with an EF of about
40 % with poor lateral squeeze. CXR showed mild volume overload
and airspace pulmonary edema. He was guiaic negative on exam.
He also did have active chest pain at 11:15 PM relieved by
sublingal nitroglycerin. A repeat ECG did showed worsening
depression in V3 and improved in V5. The attending cardiologist
assessed him in the ER, recommended heparin infusion and
nitroglycerin infusion given frequent chest discomfort.
Initial labs showed Cr 3.4 (HD patient), anion gap 22, TropnT
0.04. Hgb was 12.3 near baseline.
VS on transfer were: 105/49, 88, 18, 100% 3L nc

# IMAGING
CXR (Portable) [**2167-1-19**]
CHEST, AP: Right dialysis catheter again terminates in the mid
right atrium. Lungs are overinflated, with biapical
hyperlucency. There is new right lower lobe opacity with
obscuration of the hemidiaphragm. Increasing volume overload
with mild cardiomegaly, central venous congestion, and
interstitial/early airspace pulmonary edema. Probable small left
effusion. CABG changes are noted, with median sternotomy wires
and mediastinal clips.
IMPRESSION:
1. Possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Increasing volume overload.

# CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2167-1-20**]
(Prelim report was up)
COMMENTS:
1. Selective native coronary angiography of this right dominant
system
demonstrated severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The RCA
was not
engaged due to it having a known total occlusion.  The LMCA had
minimal
non-angiographically significant coronary artery disease with a
patent
stent.  The LAD had a proximal total occlusion.  The LCX had a
proximal
total occlusion.  The ramus had a patent stent with minimal
non-angiographically significant coronary artery disease.
2. Selective venous conduit angiography demonstrated widely
patent SVG
to PDA, and SVG to Diagnoal grafts.  The SVG to OM graft was
patent,
with a 60% stenosis at the ostium of the bypassed OM at its
point of
attachment to the LCX.
3. Selective arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a widely
patent LIMA to LAD graft.  The distal native LAD had a 80%
lesion.
4. Successful balloon angioplasty of the LAD with a 2.0 x 8 mm
balloon
(see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe two vessel native coronary artery disease (RCA not
evaluated
due to a known total occlusion)
2. Patent LIMA to LAD graft with an 80% stenosis in the distal
native
LAD.
3. Patent SVG to Diagonal, SVG to PDA, and SVG to OM grafts.
4. Mild asymptomatic systemic arterial hypotension.
5. Successful POBA of the LAD with a 2.0 x 8 mm balloon.
.
TTE [**2167-1-20**]
Moderately dilated left ventricle. Regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Probable small vegetation on
aortic valve, right coronary cusp. Moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. At least moderate
pulmonary hypertension. Mild right ventricular global
hypokinesis. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2166-9-12**], regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction is more
extensive (distal LAD territory). The severity of pulmonary
hypertension has increased. There is right ventricular
dysfunction. The aortic valve vegetation appears similar in
size.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M with CAD s/p CABG ([**2152**]), DMII, and ESRD presenting with
worsening chest pains and DOE.  He had been taking multiple
nitroglycerin tabs daily ([**8
