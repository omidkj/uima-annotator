History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 33858**] is a 68 year old woman with a history of CAD, dCHF
(EF 50-55% [**8-/2156**]), and stage V CKD who is being transferred
from [**Hospital1 **] with worsening respiratory distress. She
originally presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] on [**2156-8-28**] with several days
of diarrhea. Her hospital stay was complicated by hypoxemia,
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, non-ST elevation MI, and
hypotension.

When the patient first presented to [**Hospital1 **]-N, labs showed worsening
renal function with creatinine of 5.5-6.0 up from 3.4 in [**Month (only) 116**].
She was initially treated with IVF because pre-renal azotemia
from diarrhea was suspected however she did not improve with
fluids.
The patient was reportedly oxygenating well on arrival to [**Hospital1 **]-N,
but she became hypoxemic shortly after admission and was
transferred to their ICU. A CXR showed possible LLL opacity.
There was concern for aspiration pneumonia and so she was
treated with vancomycin and zosyn.
Labs were also notable for a Troponin-T which trended up to a
peak of 0.469 on [**8-29**]. It is not clear that she had any
symptoms related. She was not treated with heparin or cardiac
catheterization since it was ascribed to demand ischemia. Of
note she had an NSTEMI back in [**Month (only) 956**] where she was treated
medically. At that time troponin peaked at 0.75 on [**2-/2073**] but
trended down to 0.03 by [**3-21**].
During the admission she also had an exacerbation of her chronic
gastroparesis. She had an NG tube placed to suction with some
relief. There was no KUB or other documentation of concern for
SBO. There was also some report of brown "possibly"
coffee-ground emesis which was guiaic positive at [**Location (un) 620**]. Stool
guiaic was negative. HCT was 28-29 which is around her baseline.

Vital signs at [**Hospital1 **] were stable until the morning of
transfer where she dropped her SBPs to the 70s. She apparently
received Imdur as well as an extra dose of amlodipine the night
prior. She was initiated on pressors and had femoral a-line and
femoral CVL placed. She also had worsening of her respiratory
status during a similar time period. At the time of transfer she
was reportedly breathing with a respiratory rate in the 20s and
sats of 95-100% on a non-rebreather.
On arrival to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**] she is normotensive off of
pressors. She was on a non-rebreather but she was quickly able
to be lowered to a 40% face mask with O2 sats in the mid 90s.
She is not in any acute distress. Her biggest complaint is dry
mouth.

Imaging:
CXR [**2156-8-31**]
FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate new
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  An NG
tube is seen passing along the expected course and out of view
and then returning into view before terminating in the stomach.
Cardiomegaly is seen.  There is some increased vascular
congestion since prior exam.
IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Pulmonary vascular
congestion and cardiomegaly consistent with new mild pulmonary
edema.

Abdominal X-ray [**2156-9-1**]
IMPRESSION:  Unremarkable bowel gas pattern with no evidence of
obstruction. NG tube coiled in the stomach with distal tip
pointing towards the fundus, although it is not completely
imaged on this exam.

CXR [**2156-9-1**]
FINDINGS:  There is moderate vascular congestion and an enlarged
cardiac
silhouette, which suggests mild pulmonary edema.  There are
moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  There are consolidations
in the lower lobes bilaterally which could simply be areas of
lung collapse, however pneumonia cannot be ruled out on this
exam.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph after diuresis to rule
out pneumonia at the lung bases.
IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar consolidations, likely lung collapse, but
cannot rule out pneumonia.  Recommend repeat chest radiograph
after diuresis to reassess for pneumonia.

CXR [**2156-9-4**]
Right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] collapse is persistent.  Left lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**]
atelectasis have
markedly improved.  Mild vascular congestion is unchanged.
Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  HD
catheter is in standard
position.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Bilateral pleural
effusions are small.

CT of Chest [**2156-9-4**]
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: Interval development of bilateral upper [**Month/Day/Year 3630**]
predominant
ground-glass opacities, demonstrating a bronchovascular
distribution.  New
bilateral lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] atelectasis, worse on the right, with
intrinsic air
bronchograms.  The endobronchial tree is clear without evidence
of endoluminal m
