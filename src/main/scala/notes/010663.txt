Chief Complaint:
Aortoiliac atherosclerosis with disabling claudication

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aorta biprofunda bypass with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 899**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 72997**] [**10-6**]

History of Present Illness:
This 66-year-old gentleman with severe peripheral vascular
disease has severe disabling claudication in both of his
extremities. He has had a previous femoral- femoral graft which
has failed. He underwent an arteriogram
which showed his aorta to be diseased. His right common iliac
artery was ectatic and ended at the internal iliac artery with
no external iliac artery on that side. On the left side, his
entire iliac system is totally occluded with a very large
profunda femoris artery reconstituting collaterals in the
groin. Both common femoral arteries also totally occluded.
Because of the extent of his disease and his severe symptoms, he
was advised of an aortobifemoral bypass.

Surgeon:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], MD 2287

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Aortoiliac occlusive disease with
severe claudication and failed femoral-femoral bypass.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Aortoiliac occlusive disease with
severe claudication and failed femoral-femoral bypass.

PROCEDURE:  Aortobifemoral bypass with 16 x 8 Dacron graft,
proximal aortic and left renal endarterectomy and
reimplantation of inferior mesenteric artery into the graft.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

INDICATIONS:  This 66-year-old gentleman with severe
peripheral vascular disease has severe disabling claudication
in both of his extremities. He has had a previous femoral-
femoral graft which has failed. He underwent an arteriogram
which showed his aorta to be diseased. His right common iliac
artery was ectatic and ended at the internal iliac artery
with no external iliac artery on that side. On the left side,
his entire iliac system is totally occluded with a very large
profunda femoris artery reconstituting collaterals in the
groin. Both common femoral arteries also totally occluded.
Because of the extent of his disease and his severe symptoms,
he was advised of an aortobifemoral bypass.

PROCEDURE:  Under adequate general tracheal anesthesia the
abdomen and groins were prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. The old groin incisions were opened. There
was extensive scar formation in the groins. Ultimately the 2
femoral anastomoses of the [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex femoral-femoral graft
were encountered. The graft was divided close to the femoral
arteries. The common deep and superficial femoral arteries
were dissected out on both sides and encircled with vessel
loops. The common and superficial femoral arteries were
chronically occluded. The profunda femoris artery was the
only artery available for outflow.

On the right side the profunda femoris artery took off high
and took an unusual medial course to the superficial femoral
artery, and in fact it appeared as though the femoral-femoral
bypass had been implanted on the right into the superficial
femoral artery. On the left side the common femoral and
superficial femoral arteries were occluded, the graft was
into the common femoral artery. The profunda femoris artery
was calcified proximally, was soft distally, but somewhat
small in caliber.

Tunnels were created under the inguinal ligaments into the
retroperitoneal space and the femoral grafts were completely
removed from the femoral arteries where they had been
attached and the artery over sewn with 5-0 Prolene sutures.
We then made a xiphoid to pubis midline abdominal incision
and entered the abdomen without difficulty. The sigmoid colon
was pulled superiorly and the viscera retracted to the right.
The ligament of Treitz was incised and the abdominal aorta
was exposed from the crossing left renal vein to the iliac
bifurcation. The aorta was heavily calcified and there
appeared to be one area proximally near the renal arteries
which was relatively soft and appeared as safe to clamp.
There was a low-lying left renal artery which was actually
known to be 1 of 2 left renal arteries on that side. We
decided to incorporate this renal artery into a beveled
anastomosis proximally.

I had initially given some thought to an end-to-side
anastomosis because there was a very large inferior
mesenteric artery distally, but in seeing the aorta, felt
that it was too diseased for anything other than end-to-end
anastomosis. We dissected out the very large inferior
mesenteric artery encircled with vessel loop, as well as the
left renal artery. We then created retroperitoneal tunnels
between the groins and this dissection.

The patient was then heparinized and proximal distal control
was obtained. The aorta was transected in an oblique fashion
with the high end of the oblique cut tracking towards the
right side, and the left lower end cut below the left renal
artery. A large amount of atheromatous debris and plaque was
found in the aorta and this was carefully endarterectomized
including plaque in the origin of the left renal artery. The
wall of the aorta was then extraordinarily thin after doing
this, particularly on the right si
