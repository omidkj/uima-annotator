Reason: ? PE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with pmh of CABG, recently discharged for the
same, presents from rehab w/ acute onset SOB and desats to 80s
on RA (prior normal). Not clinically in CHF.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 54-year-old with recent CABG and acute-onset
shortness of breath. Evaluate for PE.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph, [**2112-3-27**] and [**2112-4-9**].

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was
performed following administration of 70 cc of IV Optiray
contrast. Coronal, sagittal and multiple oblique MIP reformats
were displayed.

CTA OF THE CHEST: There are multiple segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary emboli involving all lobes of the lung. Clot burden is
extensive. There is mild enlargement of the right atrium,
suggesting right heart strain. The aorta is of normal caliber
with no evidence of dissection. Heart size is normal with
minimal pericardial fluid. There is a fluid collection extending
retrosternally along the anterior mediastinum, measuring
approximately 5.7 TRV x 1.3 AP x 6.0 CC in dimension which may
simply be postoperative fluid, though infection cannot be
excluded. The sternal wires are intact and there is no evidence
of sternal dehiscence. There is a clear fat plane between this
fluid collection and the great vessels. Extensive coronary
artery calcifications and multiple CABG grafts are noted. There
is a moderate left-sided non- loculated pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis, within normal limits given the patient's
post-cardiac surgery status. There are peripheral ground- glass
opacities within the anterior right upper lobe which are
nonspecific but may represent infectious or inflammatory
etiology. No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, axillary, or
hilar lymph nodes.

This exam is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic assessment. The
visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands are
normal.

There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. Prominent
confluent anterior osteophytosis of the mid-thoracic spine is
noted.

IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with suggestion of right
heart strain. Findings were posted to the ED dashboard at the
time of the exam.

2. Retrosternal fluid collection, which may simply be
postoperative fluid, though infection cannot be excluded. No
evidence of sternal dehiscence.

3. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.

COMPARISONS: None.

FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler assessment of the right and left
common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal veins was
performed. Normal flow, augmentation and compressibility is
demonstrated of the right and left common femoral, right and
left superficial femoral and left popliteal veins. Echogenic
material is seen to expand the right popliteal vein above the
knee and is consistent in appearance with acute thrombus.
Echogenic material is seen to extend in to the right posterior
tibial and peroneal veins also consistent in appearance with
thrombosis. Doppler assessment of the calf veins of the left leg
demonstrates echogenic material within the left peroneal vein
consistent with acute thrombus.

IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with deep vein thrombosis
involving the right popliteal vein. Acute thrombis extends into
the posterior tibial and peroneal veins as well as the left
peroneal vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery [**4-9**] and started on IV heparin
and coumadin. He was diuresed for a moderate left effusion.
Lower extremity dopplers showed a right DVT.  He was transferred
to the ICU for increased work of breathing. He was seen by
vascular surgery and there was no indication for an IVC filter.
His breathing improved and he was transferred back to the floor.
His INR was therapeutic and he was ready for discharge home on
hospital day #5. Target INR is 2.0-3.0 for PE/DVT.
First blood draw [**4-16**] with results to be called to PCP [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5936**] for coumadin dosing/INR followup. Pt. is to make all
followup appts. as directed in discharge instructions.
