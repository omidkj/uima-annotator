SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former smoke, has not
smoked for 17 years. Previously had greater than a 70-pack-
year history of smoking. Patient denies alcohol or drug use.
Patient lives with his spouse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: 97, 8, 84, 22, blood
pressure 108/64, oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
Fingerstick glucose on admission was 428. Patient weighs 247
pounds. General appearance: A gentleman in no acute distress.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 nd S2. Lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal examination was
soft, nontender, nondistended, obese. The left first toe is
open ulcer with tissue loss distal to the nail. Pulse
examination shows femoral pulses are palpable bilaterally.
The popliteals are nonpalpable bilaterally. The right PT is
[**Name (NI) **]. The right DP and the left DP and PT are non-
[**Name (NI) **] signals.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the vascular
service. He was prehydrated for diagnostic arteriogram. He
was begun on antibiotics for his toe ulceration. An x-ray of
the left foot was obtained to rule out osteomyelitis. The
initial culture grew staph coag positive of moderate growth,
beta streptococcal group B, moderate growth, gram negative
rods, rare of pre-colony morphology. The staph coag positive
was sensitive to gentamicin, levofloxacin, oxacillin,
resistant to penicillin. Sensitive to Bactrim. There were no
anaerobe cultures growth. The patient's foot films showed
extensive small artery calcification throughout the foot.
There was mild subluxation and degeneration changes of both
the first metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joint but
no bone destruction to suggest osteomyelitis. The lateral
view, however, shows an erosion that centers at the anterior
inferior articulating surface of the calcaneus of his mid
foot which is suggestive of osteoarticular infection. Two
overhead views show rare fraction of bone at the bases of the
third and fourth metatarsals. CT scanning is recommended for
any further evaluation of the foot. The patient was continued
on antibiotics considering the cultures and the link that is
there for antibiotics these were discontinued. The patient
underwent a diagnostic arteriogram on [**2143-4-1**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient tolerated the procedure well. There was
a questionable small hematoma in the right groin. The pulse
examination remained unchanged. The patient was prepared for
surgery. The patient's urine was dirty and ciprofloxacin was
instituted along with Vancomycin and Flagyl. The patient had
vein mapping obtained to assess for conduit for surgery. The
angiography demonstrated patent inflow. Left superficial
femoral artery was diseased with a patent anterior tibial
with proximal and distal disease and a patent dorsalis pedis.
Patient underwent on [**2143-4-3**] a left femoral DP bypass
with in situ saphenous vein graft. The patient tolerated the
procedure well, was extubated in the operating room and was
transferred to the post anesthesia care unit for continued
care. Patient did return because of a hematoma development
which required evacuation under anesthesia in which there was
an avulsion on the vein graft tie and this was repaired and
bleeding was controlled. The patient was transfused 2 units
of packed cells. The patient's graft was palpable at the end
of the hematoma evacuation. Patient was then transferred to
the post anesthesia care unit for continued monitoring and
care.

Patient's hematocrit was 24.5. He was transfused. He
continued to do well from a hemodynamic standpoint. Because
the patient remained intubated after undergoing the hematoma
evacuation he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit for continued postoperative care. His post transfusion
hematocrit was 27.7. BUN 16, creatinine 0.7. The patient's
respiratory wean was initiated to extubate. The patient's
Swan was discontinued. His [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain in the
hematoma area remained in place. Total [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drainage
for the first 24 hours was 80 cc. Patient's graft was
palpable. Patient had persistent hypotension. He was given IV
steroids for adrenal insufficiency with improvement in his
hemodynamic status and he was able to be extubated.
Antibiotics were discontinued. Postoperative day 2 there were
no overnight events. Patient was transfused a unit of packed
cells on [**2143-4-6**]. Patient's Lopressor was increased
secondary to poor heart rate control and systolic blood
pressure control. Patient was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care. Postoperative day 3 he did
require Lasix x2. He was put back on his oral steroids. Blood
pressures were under better control. Aggressive pulmonary
toiletry was begun. His right internal jugular was
discontinued on postoperative day 5 for temperature elevation
of 101.8. The blood cultures were no growth. Urine cultures
were negative. The Foley was discontinued. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**]
drain remained in place. Postoperative day 6 repeat urine
culture was done and the patient was started on
ciprofloxacin, that was [**2143-4-8**]. Ambulation was begun
and diuresis was continued. The patient had [**Year (4 digits) **] pedal
pulses bilaterally.

The remaining hospital course was unremarkable. The patient
will be assessed by physical therapy in determination whether
he will require rehabilitation screening. Case management was
consulted for discharge planning. Patient will be discharged
when medically stable and bed available.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient should ambulate essential
