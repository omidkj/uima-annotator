woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, congestive heart failure and hypertension, who was
admitted to the medical intensive care unit on [**2130-10-18**].
She initially presented to [**Last Name (un) 36412**]
mental status; the patient was extremely confused, with
slurred speech and diaphoresis.  She had gone to her primary
care physician earlier in the day secondary to a headache
with possible subacute confusion, i.e. not feeling herself,
for several days prior.

At [**Hospital 26200**] Hospital, the patient was intubated on
protection.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for medical intensive care unit care.  Workup

Hospital course was notable for a blood pressure of 210/100
as well.

On the day of admission after a visit to her primary care
physician's office, the patient went into the bathroom and
had a bowel movement.  She needed her husband to help her
walk and sit down when coming out of the bathroom.  She then
seemed confused, not knowing family names, repeating "Who is
that?".  She was on the phone when there was no one on the
other end.  Her husband commented that her speech seemed
slurred and was not making sense, but there were no clear
word substitutions.  The patient also appeared diaphoretic at
that time.  By the time that the EMS arrived, the patient had
lost consciousness.  Her subsequent course was as noted
above.
