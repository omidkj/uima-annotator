History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 45 yo F with PVD, DM, HL, HTN and OSA. no known
CAD, no history cath who presents with chest pain and pressure
for 5 days. Patient was last in her usual state of health 5 days
prior to admission when she began to feel an intense chest
pressure and heaviness in the left chest radiating up to the jaw
while walking to her car. At this time she also felt intense
nausea. The pain and nausea abated on its own but recurred more
intensely that night accompanied with vomiting. At home, she
took one of her boyfriend's nitroglycerin which brought about
partial relief of pain. She continued over the weekend to have
pain, nausea, and vomiting recurring which was relieved with her
boyfriend's nitroglycerin. In total, she reports taking 7 nitros
for these episodes over the weekend. She had progressive fatigue
as the days progressed, and on day of presentation took a
shower, after which she felt extreme pronounced fatigue which
prompted her to present to the hospital. She reports worsening
orthopnea and DOE. Also, while she was on full dose aspirin due
to PVD, has not taken it while being on coumadin.

acute and CXR was normal. Troponin and ckmb were neg x2. Patient
underwent stress MIBI which showed new partially reversible
inferior wall mild perfusion defect.

STUDIES:

CTA [**3-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, coronary
arteries, and
splenic artery.
3. Stable pulmonary calcified granulomas.

STRESS MIBI [**3-19**]:
INTERPRETATION: This was a 45 year old DM2 woman with PVD, HTN
and
HLD who was referred to the lab from the ED after negative
serial
cardiac enzymes for an evaluation of chest discomfort. She
received
0.142mg/kg/min of IV Persantine infused over 4 minutes. She
complained
of mid-sternal chest pressure and nausea immediate post
Persantine
infusion, which was relieved with the administration of 125mg IV

Aminophylline. There were no changes in ST segments or T waves
noted
during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus without
ectopy.
The heart rate and blood pressure responded appropriately to the

Persantine infusion. At 2:15 post infusion, 125mg IV
Aminophylline was
given to reverse the Persantine side effects.

IMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes. Persantine induced symptoms

reported. Appropriate hemodynamic response. Nuclear report sent
separately.

MIBI Report [**3-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. New partially reversible inferior wall mild perfusion defect.

2. Normal left ventricular wall motion and cavity size. LVEF
62%.

Cardiac Cath [**3-20**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated
single vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was patent. The
LAD had
a 30% mid segment stenosis. The Lcx was patent with no
angiographically
apparent disease.  The RCA was tortuous with diffuse disease.
There was
a 40% proximal lesion and a 40% mid lesion.  There was a 95% mid
to
distal lesion.
2.  Limited hemodynamics revealed centralized systolic
normotension.
3. Successful PCI with 6 Integrity BMS to the RCA (from the
distal
bifurcation to the ostium) complicated by spiral dissection
which had
completely been treated with the stents; no residual dissection.

4. Terumo band to right radial artery.
5. Integrillin for 12 hours post-cath.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI to the RCA with six Integrity BMS.
3. No post-procedure complications.
4. Patient to remain on aspirin indefintely and clopidogrel for
at least
1 year, uniterrupted, however duration of coumadin to be
established.
