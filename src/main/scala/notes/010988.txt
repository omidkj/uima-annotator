Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 301**]
Chief Complaint:
Jaundice, abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
Patient is 83 year-old female transferred from [**Hospital **]
hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-11-20**] for management of gallstone
pancreatitis. She was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for an
ankle fracture, for which she underwent orthopaedic surgery and
an external fixation device was placed. Post-operatively at
[**Hospital1 **] she developed 3 days of epigastric pain and jaundice
and was diagnosed with pancreatitis and stone in the
gallbladder. MRCP showed 1cm common bile duct and intrahepatic
ductal dilatation. ERCP was then attempted and was aborted when
the patient developed tachycardia during the procedure. She was
evaluated by [**Hospital1 **] cardiology for paroxysmal a-fib and
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Past Medical History:
Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, previously not anticoagulated
CAD, stable angina
TIA
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
s/p TAH/BSO
s/p pinning of Right ankle

Discharge labs: ([**2199-12-11**])
INR 1.6, wbc 6.6, hct 28.6

CT [**11-29**]
1. Edematous pancreas with peripancreatic inflammatory changes
consistent
with pancreatitis. No mass is visualized in the pancreatic head
or
surrounding the common bile duct. A small mass may be present
but obliterated by the diffuse inflammatory changes. The
pancreas enhances homogeneously, there is no evidence of
necrosis.
2. No biliary dilatation. Findings consistent with hepatic
cirrhosis.
Conventional hepatic vasculature.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is mild thickening of the colonic wall throughout which
may be secondary to low protein state.
4. A peripheral opacity seen in the right upper lobe is likely
related to
inflammatory changes. A nodule in the atelectatic portion of the
lung would not be visualized.

Echocardiogram [**2199-12-4**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum
atrial septal defect. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented as outlined above and was admitted to the SICU
at [**Hospital1 18**]. RUQ ultrasound showed distended gall bladder with
positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign, and the patient was diagnosed with
cholecystitis as well as pancreatitis. She was started on broad
spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/ceftazidime/Flagyl), hydrated, and a
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was successfully placed by
ultrasound guidance. Her white count dropped to 3.3 after the
procedure and there was initial concern that the patient she was
developing a septic picture, however blood cultures were
negative, bile cultures grew MDR E-coli (although sensitivities
at this point were still pending). Gastroenterology and
orthopaedic services were both consulting on the patient, and
cardiac enzymes were sent that returned negative. The patient
remained afebrile, clinically stable, and her LFTs continued to
trend down over the next several days while her white count
returned to the normal range. She was started on clears on [**11-23**]
and MRCP was entertained but held given the presence of the
external fixation device, as well as decreasing total bili and
the recent OSH MRCP that did not reveal an obstruction.
Orthopaedics was re-consulted regarding temporary removal but
did not favor doing so. She was transferred out of the ICU on
[**2199-11-23**], with pancreatic enzymes normalized, and her antibiotic
regimen was changed to imipenem once the bile cultures-Ecoli
sensitivities returned. Her LFTs seemed to reach a plateau in
their decline near [**11-26**] and due to remaining above normal, and
an increase in the wbc to 12, an ERCP was performed on [**11-27**]
which revealed a non-dilated bile duct with a tapered stricture
in the distal CBD. The intrahepatic ducts appeared normal. CT
scan was performed on [**11-29**], which did not reveal a mass or
other cause of the CBD stricture. Please see the results section
above for the summarized findings. Right lower extremity
ultrasound was also performed per orthopaedic request that was
negative for a DVT. Patient was tolerating a full diet however
her intake was poor, and TPN was initiated on [**11-28**] via a newly
placed PICC line. Cardiology was consulted on [**11-29**] when the
patient experienced a short episode of asymptomatic Vtach
overnight and subsequent atrial fibrillation that responded to
beta-blockers. Her electrolytes were monitored closely and an
echocardiogram was obtained that demonstrated EF 55% with
relatively well-preserved global function. The patient was
slightly fluid overloaded and did well with some mild diuresis,
with no further episodes of vtach or a-fib. She has a known
diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and therefore
cardiology recommended longterm anticoagulation. Coumadin was
initiated with a brief period of lovenox until she became
therapeutic. Due to persistent leakage around the
cholecystostomy tube a paracentesis was performed on [**2199-12-4**] that
drained several liters of clear, non-bilous ascites. Worry for a
bile leak was primary reason for the paracentesis, which
revealed simple ascites, likely due to malnutrition, and bile
leak was ruled out. Over the next week patient was feeling
considerably better and her laboratory results were also
improved. Total bili fell to below 2 and her wbc again
normalized. On [**2199-12-6**] she was noted to have several small, loose
stools and a cdiff test was sent that returned positive. She did
not experience any further loose stools, and showed no other
symptoms of infection. Infectious disease was consulted and did
not recommend treatment with flagyl for likely bacterial
shedding. Her meropenem was discontinued on [**12-6**] after a full, 2
week course. She remained afebrile, and her appetite slowly
picked up (calorie counts). Her Picc line was removed on [**12-10**]
and the TPN was weaned off. She is being discharged to rehab on
[**2199-12-11**], afebrile, tolerating a full diet with
borderline-sufficient calorie counts and emphatic refusal of any
sort of feeding tube. She is still non-weight bearing on the RLE
and activity is still limited to sitting up in the chair daily
as a goal. She will need very close follow-up with her
internist/the rehab internist, orthopaedics, general surgery and
possibly thoracic surgery as outlined in the PAGE 1 referral.
