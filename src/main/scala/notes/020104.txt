s/p cardiac cath with BMS to Left circ

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old male with a history of CAD s/p PCI
to LCx [**2128**], CHF, moderate to severe aortic stenosis who was
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for catheterization with
NSTEMI. According to [**Hospital1 **] records the patient presented from
home complaining of "not feeling well" since last night. He had
+cough productive of white sputum. He denied chest pain,
abdominal pain and fever. He later complained of shortness of
breath He was initially treated with IV diuresis and biomarkers
were cycled. Labs were significant for BNP 600, troponin
0.08>1.43>1.65>0.38, CK 225>195, CKMB 12.7>8.9. He also had a
positive stress test. Of note, he also had 7 beat run of VT at
OSH and atenolol was increased.
.
Today during catheterization patient was noted to have tight
95-99% stenotic lesion just after the LCx stent. The pressure
wire was placed in the LAD and became totally occluded. Patient
had chest discomfort with ST depressions on ECG and decrease in
BP. At that time the patient became hypotensive and bradycardic.
He received 2mg Atropine and subsequently developed VF. CPR was
initiated. He received multiple shocks ([**5-5**]), amiodarone 300mg x
1 followed by 150mg x 1, epinephrine 2mg and lidocaine 100mg x1.
He was also started on an amiodarone gtt at 2mg/min decreased to
1mg/min and a lidocaine gtt at 2mg/min. He was also intubated
for airway protection. An IABP was inserted. The LAD was
reopened successfully and stented with a bare metal stent. An
echocardiogram was also done in the cath lab which showed normal
LV, ? small segment of anterior hypokinesis. A Swan showed PCWP
of 35 after the case (initially was 15).
.
On transfer to the CCU, the patient is intubated. He is off of
the lidocaine gtt, continues on amiodarone at 1mg/min and is on
dopamine 10mcg/min to maintain his MAPs. An intra-aortic balloon
pump is in place in the right groin.
.
Of note, at [**Hospital1 **] the patient was seen by GU for gross
hematuria. This was felt attributable to traumatic catheter
insertion. They recommended sending urine cytology and
outpatient cystoscopy to rule out mass or obstruction.

Review of systems

The patient denies any claudication-type symptoms, melena,
rectal bleeding, or transient neurologic deficits.  No change in
weight or bowel habit. No cough, fever, night sweats,
arthralgias, myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of
systems  negative.

3/3Echo:Suboptimal image quality. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with probable
mild anterior wall hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-5-17**],
left ventricular systolic function is slightly less vigorous.
The right ventricular function is borderline hypokinetic. The
other findings are similar.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no angiographically

apparent disease. The LAD had a 50-70% lesion at D1; D1 was a
moderately
small vessel with diffuse disease. The Lcx had 30% ostial and
proximal
lesions. The stent in the OM was widely patent with 80% stenosis
distal
to the stent. The RCA was known to be occluded and filled via
LAD
collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right filling

pressures with LVEDP of 26 mmHg, mean PCW of 15 mmHg, and RVEDP
of 22
mmHg. There was moderate systolic pulmonary hypertension with
