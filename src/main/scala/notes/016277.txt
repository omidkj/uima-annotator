Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Initiation of CVVH and hemodialysis
Placement of a 23 cm 14.5 French tunneled hemodialysis line


History of Present Illness:
years presenting with confusion, lethargy, and bowel and urinary
incontinence for 1 week at home.
.
The patient is unable to give a meaningful history, but was
found by his sister to be confused and lethargic, sitting in his
stool and urine. He was brought to an OSH where he was found to
have BP 86/41, HR 70s, PO2 100%. He was found to be guaiac
positive with hct 18, creatinine 6.8, BUN 89, INR 2.1, ammonia
200. He received 3U pRBCs and IVF at the OSH with SBP 140's on
arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: 88/40. The patient was found
to have BRB on rectal exam and an NGT was placed with dark red,
coffe ground, clotted blood which did not clear with 500cc NG
lavage. Hepatology was consulted and the patient was started on
pantoprazole gtt and octreotide gtt. Hct had increased to 25.7
following transfusion at OSH, and remained stable with SBP
stable in the 100's. He was found to have ascites and a
paracentesis was performed. Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV was started
empirically. The patient was found to be hypothermic at 92 and
was placed on a bear hugger. Blood cultures were sent. He was
A&0x2. The patient was also found to have extensive erythema in
the folds of his skin and diffusely over his lower body, and
Surgery was consulted to r/o Fournier's gangrene. Surgery felt
there was no concern for Fourniers gangrene. He was admitted to
the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was unable to provide a
meaningful history but denied pain currently.
.

Imaging:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass
effect, or
infarction. Prominent ventricles and sulci suggest age-related
involutional changes. Confluent areas of low attenuation in the
periventricular white matter are nonspecific and most likely due
to small vessel disease. A 4-mm round calcification in the right
operculum is likely a dural calcification or small granuloma.
The basal cisterns are patent. No fracture is identified.  The
visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear
cavities are clear. Mild atherosclerotic mural calcification of
the vertebral and internal carotid arteries is noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Evidence of age-related atrophy and small vessel disease.
3. Incidental calcification in the right operculum is likely a
dural
calcification or a small granuloma.
.
DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL
FINDINGS: There is a moderate-sized right pleural effusion. The
liver is
diffusely echogenic and nodular in contour. No focal liver
lesion identified. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic duct
dilation. The common duct measures 4 mm. There is normal
hepatopetal flow within the portal vein. There is mild
gallbladder wall thickening, which is likely due to patient's
underlying liver disease. No cholelithiasis. No pericholecystic
fluid. The spleen is normal in size measuring 10.4 cm. The
pancreas is not visualized due to overlying bowel gas.
The left kidney was not visualized. The right kidney is normal
in size and
echogenicity, measuring 10.9 cm. No evidence of hydronephrosis,
renal lesion or stones. The aorta was not well visualized. The
visualized portions of the IVC are normal. There is a small
amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
IMPRESSION:
1. Fatty liver with nodular contour consistent with patient's
history of
cirrhosis. No focal liver lesion identified.
2. Right pleural effusion.
3. Small amount of intra-abdominal ascites. The remainder of the
study is
normal.
