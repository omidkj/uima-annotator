Brief Hospital Course:
After transfer from OSH, pt underwent CT of chest which revealed
no dissection or PE. He was then brought to the Cath lab which
revealed severe 3 vessel disease, severe left ventricular
systolic dysfunction and an EF of 25%. Afterwards he was brought
to the CCU for further care (heparin gtt started) and we
(cardiac surgery) were consulted for surgical intervention.
Prior to surgery patient needed multiple tests, including
carotid u/s, vein mapping (pt had b/l varicose veins), upper
extremity u/s (for poss. radial artery harvest), and Echo. Over
the next several days, pt. was diuresed and "fine-tuned" prior
to cardiac surgery. On HD # 6 pt was brought to the operating
room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 3. He
tolerated the procedure well with a CPB time of 70 min and XCT
of 57 min. Please see op note for surgical details. Pt. was
transferred to the CSRU in stable condition with the following
gtts: Epinephrine, Milrinone, Levophed, and Propofol. Pt.
remained intubated overnight and was weaned from propofol and
mechanical ventilation early AM on POD #1. He also received 1
unit of PBC's overnight. On POD #1 he still remained on
Epinephrine, Levophed, and Milrinone. An Insulin gtt was added
for better glycemic control and Chest tubes were removed. By POD
#2 Epinephrine and Levophed were weaned off. Milrinone was
weaned off on POD #3. He was stable and remained in CSRU for one
more day. Had some decreased breath sounds bilat. Diuretic and
b-blockers were started per protocol. Swan-Ganz catheter was
d/c'd on POD #3 and epicardial pacing wires d/c on POD #5.
Transferred to telemetry floor on POD #4. [**Name (NI) **] pt
was improving well w/ good ambulation and without complications
(although required extended unit stay for hemodynamic support w/
Milrinone). Physical exam was unremarkable at time of d/c. Labs
were stable, pt was at level 5 and he was discharged home with
VNA services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
