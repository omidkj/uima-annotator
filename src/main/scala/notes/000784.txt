This dictation covers the patient's hospitalization from
[**2115-3-26**], to [**2115-3-28**], while on the C-Medicine service.
Hospital course from admission through [**2115-3-26**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Vascular Surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from Vascular
Surgery to the C-Medicine Service following ICD placement.

1.  Cardiac - ICD was placed without complication.  The
patient was monitored on telemetry without any events of
ventricular tachycardia though occasional premature
ventricular contractions were noted on telemetry.  He was
continued on Amiodarone at 200 mg p.o. once daily. His
Lopressor was continued at the same dose of 50 mg twice a
day.

2.  Congestive heart failure - The patient's Captopril was
titrated from 6.25 mg up to 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
He appeared total body volume overloaded and was diuresed
with Lasix, initially intravenous and then changed to 40 mg
p.o. twice a day, with good effect.

3.  Ischemia - He was continued on his Aspirin.

4.  Pulmonary - At the time of transfer, the patient had a
significant oxygen requirement of six liters to maintain an
oxygen saturation of greater than 90%.  Chest x-ray was
repeated which revealed persistent left lower lobe effusion
likely residual from his bypass surgery, as well as
persistent bibasilar atelectasis and prominent pulmonary
vasculature suggesting mild congestive heart failure.  He was
given incentive spirometer and encouraged to use it
frequently which he did.  In addition, he was diuresed with
Lasix as above with good effect.  Physical therapy evaluated
the patient and on ambulation found that his oxygen
saturation dropped to 78% in room air while ambulating on
[**2115-3-26**].  At the time of discharge, the patient has been at
88 to 90% on two liters of oxygen via nasal cannula.  He was
discharged with home oxygen with visiting nurses to assess
his oxygen requirement and wean as tolerated with Lasix at 40
mg p.o. twice a day to be taken for one week and then down to
once daily.

5.  Infectious disease - At the time of transfer, the patient
was on Levofloxacin which had been started prior to the
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.  This was discontinued
after completion of a seven day course.  His interval urinary
tract infection appears to have cleared as a culture drawn on
[**2115-3-25**], had no growth at the time of this dictation.  He
was given periprocedural antibiotics for his ICD placement,
initially Cefazolin intravenously, however, the patient lost
peripheral access and was changed to Keflex p.o. which he
will continue to take four days following discharge.

6.  Endocrine - The patient's blood sugar has been running a
bit high and the patient was on insulin sliding scale.  The
patient did not have a history of diabetes mellitus and at
the time of transfer, his blood sugar was well within the
normal range.  It is likely his blood sugar was running on
the high side due to a stress response from the multitude of
procedures that the patient had undergone.  His insulin
sliding scale was discontinued and his blood sugar remained
normal.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. three times a day.
4.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q6hours to end on [**2115-3-31**].
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. twice a day for one week and then once
daily thereafter.
7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
8.  Dulcolax 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. constipation.
9.  Lactulose 30 ccs three times a day p.r.n. constipation.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has a follow-up appointment to see
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Device Clinic on [**2115-4-3**], at 2:30 p.m.  He
is to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31998**] to make an appointment
to be seen in two weeks in follow-up.  Finally, he is to call
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 28544**], to make an appointment to be
seen four weeks following discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Ventricular tachycardia, status post ablation and ICD
placement.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction and three vessel coronary artery bypass graft.
3.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm, status post endovascular
repair.
4.  Urinary tract infection.
