HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given patient's hypoxemic respiratory
distress, differential diagnosis including pneumonia vs
pneumothorax vs ARDS, he was supported with mechanical
ventilation.  He was covered empirically with Ceftazidime and
Vancomycin.  Due to hemodynamic instability, he was started
on Dopamine.  Additionally, his acute renal failure was
