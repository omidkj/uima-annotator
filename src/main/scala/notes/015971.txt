MRI [**7-15**]
 Large extra-axial right frontal lesion with a 1-cm enhancing
focus and adjacent area of low signal indicating sclerosis,
similar in
appearance compared to the outside MRI head study. Given the
extra-axial
location, pleomorphic xanthoastrocystoma and ganglioglioma are
deemed less likely.  The associated focal calvarial sclerosis
could be seen with
meningioma or possibly sequela of prior procedure.  Please
correlate with
histopathology findings.

MRI [**7-16**]
******************
IMPRESSION:
1.  Interval removal of the right frontal extra-axial lesion
with improvement
in the extra-axial widening.
2.  T2 hyperintense lesion in the right frontal lobe extending
from the
surgical margin deeper into the white matter, corresponding with
restricted diffusion and hypointensity on ADC mapping, could be
secondary to ischemia in the deeper white matter.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented for an elective removal of a right frontal
brain mass. The patient underwent a right frontal craniotomy on
[**7-15**] and tolerated the procedure well. See operative note for
details. She was transferred to the surgical ICU for postop
monitoring. Her post op check revealed an intact neurologic
exam. On post op day 1 she had severe nausea and dry heaves that
was difficult to control with multiple antiemetics. She finally
got relief with Ativan.

On [**7-17**] the patient was doing well and neurologically intact so
was transfered out of the ICU. Her Keppra was stopped and we
started to taper her dexamethasone.

On [**7-18**], the patient was neurologically intact, alert and
oriented x 4. She expressed willingness to go home and all
questions were answered.
