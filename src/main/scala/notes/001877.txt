Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**]
Chief Complaint:
Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T6 vertebrectomy and posterior fusion T2-9
TRANSFUSION FOR BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA POST-OP


History of Present Illness:
56yo female with newly diagnosed metastatic cancer of unknown
primary (likely lung) was admitted with back pain likely related
to cord compression and destructive metastatic lesions.
Unfortunately patient does not have any medical records at [**Hospital1 18**]
and is somewhat poor historian herself.

She was reportedly diagnosed with metastatic cancer (no
pathologic diagnosis but thought likely primary lung) over the
last several weeks. She has had chronic back pain, which has
worsened over the last several weeks. She was diagnosed with
multiple vertebral compression fractures and was scheduled for
outpatient kyphoplasty at [**Hospital6 10353**]. She then
presented to [**Hospital6 10353**] on the day prior to admission
with increased back pain. CT T and L spine demonstrated findings
concerning for cord compression at T6. Due to the concern for
cord compression, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.

Upon arrival in the ED, temp 97.6, HR 68, BP 132/68, RR 14, and
pulse ox 98% on room air. Exam was notable for marked back pain
and rhonchorous bilateral breath sounds. She received total of
5mg IV dilaudid (2mg, 2mg, and 1mg) and zofran. Neurosurgery was
consulted in the ED who recommended MRI T spine.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. back pain, 3 weeks of night sweats, 20 lb weight
loss over the last 2 months, chronic loose stools related to her
colectomy, occasional shortness of breath, anterior rib pain
diffusely, bilateral hip pain, occasional palpitations, nausea,
muscle aches

rhinorrhea, congestion, cough, vomiting, constipation, abdominal
pain, change in bladder habits, dysuria, arthralgias, or
myalgias, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence

OSH STUDIES:
CXR - [**2116-11-16**] right lung mass compatible with neoplasm

CT Thoracic and Lumbar Spine - [**2116-11-16**] - Findings are
compatible with right middle lobe primary lung cancer with
metastatic disease to the T2 and T6 vertebral bodies. There is
destruction of the T6 vertebral body with posterior extension of
tumor to cause cord compression. There is what appears to be
metastatic disease to the left adrenal gland.

Brief Hospital Course:
56F with a history of asthma, COPD, R lung mass and metastatic
cancer with 8-wk h/o LBP related to cord compression and
metastatic lesions.  The patient also suffers from spinal
stenosis.  The lung mass was sampled via broncoscopy and shown
to be NSCLC.  CT is concerning for metastatic disease to
vertebral bodies and cord compression at T6.  There is an
additional met to an adrenal gland.
.
1) Back pain.
Etiology likely r/t metastatic disease to spinal cord in
background of 6-year h/o spinal stenosis.  CXR [**11-19**] shows no
evidence of pneumothorax.
?????? Dilaudid PO
?????? Fentanyl patch (100 mcg/hr TP Q72H)
?????? Lidocaine patch (5% 3 daily)
?????? Tizanidine (2 mg PO QHS) for muscle relaxation
- PRN bowel regimen in setting of high dose narcotics (note h/o
colectomy).
?????? Patient allergic to lyrica
.
2) Cord compression. T-spine MRI reveals cord compression at T6
from path comp fracture and circumferential epidural mass.
Advanced DDD including compressive central disc herniation at
C3-4 w/ additional multilevel canal/foraminal narrowing in C/L
spine.  Lytic lesion in anterosuperior R iliac crest, L pelvic
side wall.  Head CT/MRI show no acute intracranial processes or
masses. Bone scan completed, no other mets.
- Out of bed with brace
- Lower left weakness improving ([**5-26**]), otherwise neurologically
intact. Frequent neuro checks
- Neurosurgery and rad onc recs greatly appreciated
- Continuing dexamethasone 4 mg Q6H (stop prednisone).  Please
note: given chronic h/o prednisone use, MUST start PO prednisone
taper after dexamethasone is discontinued.
- Neurosurg took to OR [**2116-11-27**] where under general anesthesia pt
underwent T6 vertebrectomy with cage placement and posterior
fusion T2-9.  Due to prolonged prone position, pt was kept
intubated overnight and monitored closely in ICU and was
extubated POD#1.  Her motor exam was full. She had JP drain that
was monitored for output. It was removed POD#3. Her incision was
clean and dry.  Her diet and activit
