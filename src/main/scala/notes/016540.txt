prior myocardial infarctions at the age of 39 and 44 with an
angioplasty of the proximal left circumflex in [**2139**].  He
reports doing until one month prior to admission when he
began feeling more fatigued with less activity, and he was
experiencing dyspnea on exertion - especially with stairs.

He had a cardiac catheterization on [**8-5**] which

artery lesion, 80 percent mid left anterior descending
lesion, and 80 percent first obtuse marginal lesion, mild
pulmonary hypertension.  He also had an echocardiogram on
[**8-5**] which revealed mild dilatation of the left
atrium, an ejection fraction of 45 percent, and inferior wall
hypokinesis.  He was recommended to have surgery at that time
but refused.

He presented back to the hospital shortness of breath, and
chest pain, and numbness in his left arm which was relieved
with nitroglycerin.

artery disease (status post myocardial infarctions at the age
of 39 and 44), status post PTCA in [**2139**], history of diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, status post left leg deep venous thrombosis, history
of gastroesophageal reflux disease, diabetic neuropathy,
varicose veins, and peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He is status post repair of a right
knee aneurysm, status post a right bypass, status post
bilateral hip surgery, status post carpal tunnel release,
status post cholecystectomy, and status post excision of
benign skin growth.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He is an elderly white
male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs were stable.  He
was afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  The extraocular
movements were intact.  The oropharynx was benign.  The neck
was supple.  Full range of motion.  No lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  Carotids were 2 plus and equal bilaterally.  No
bruits.  The lungs had fine rales at the bilateral bases.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  The abdomen was
soft and nontender.  There were positive bowel sounds.  The
extremities were without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  His
right leg was significantly larger than the left.  The pulses
were 2 plus and equal bilaterally with the exception of the
left dorsalis pedis which was a dopplerable pulse and
posterior tibial pulse which was 1 plus.  His neurologic
examination was nonfocal.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] was

artery bypass grafting times two with a left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending and reversed saphenous
vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  His cross-clamp time was
39 minutes.  Total bypass time was 52 minutes.

He was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on
nitroglycerin and propofol.  On his postoperative night he
had a right upper lobe collapse and was bronched, and his
lung fully reexpanded.  He required aggressive treatment with
Combivent inhaler.  He was extubated that night.

The following day he continued to progress.  He had his chest
tubes out on postoperative day one.  He required a lot of
respiratory therapy and diuresis.  He was transferred to the
