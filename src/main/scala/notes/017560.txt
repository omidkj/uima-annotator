History of Present Illness:
75 yoM w/ h/o CAD s/p CABG X 4, Type II DM, CRI presents from
[**Hospital1 **] with persistant anemia. Pt had prolonged admission
[**Date range (3) 21103**] following NSTEMI. Given 3 vessel disease on
cath, he underwent CABG X 4 [**2187-3-22**]. Post-op course c/b left
hemothorax, respiratory distress requiring re-intubation POD #9
followed by prolonged wean requiring trach/PEG [**2187-4-3**]. He was
diagnosed with VAP (Pseudomonas cepacia, MRSA), for which he was
treated with meropenem/vanco for 14 day course (completed [**5-14**]).
He was discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab [**2187-5-11**]. He was weaned to a
trach mask by early [**5-29**]. On [**5-31**] a CXR (obtained due to
increased thick yellow secretions) showed moderate pulmonary
edema with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Sputum cx from [**5-31**]
grew Enterobacter cloacae, Paeruginsoa, and MRSA. He was covered
with Ceftaz/vanco starting [**6-4**] for presumed ventilator
associated pneumonia. On [**6-8**], RR was noted to be increased with
decreased O2 sats and he was placed back on vent (PS 15/5, FiO2
0.4, PEEP 5). His HCT decreased to 24 [**6-9**], for which he
received 2u PRBC with improvement of HCT to 31, followed by
decline to 29.6 today. Per NH records, he has had 3 transfusions
over the last 2-3 weeks (exact # unclear) and stools have been
brown gauiac positive. He was also noted to have increased tube
feed residuals, and vomited once today. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] today for further w/u of suspected GI bleed.
.
In the ED, T 97.5, p 58, bp 130/56, resp 18, 100% AC 550 x 16,
FiO2 0.5, PEEP 5. Lavage through PEG tube with BRB with mucus.
He received Protonix 40 mg IV X 1 and was transferred to MICU
for further management. Currently, the patient denies shortness
of breath, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain. He has had
alternating constipation and diarrhea for the last several
weeks.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2187-6-25**] 5:59 PM

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: evaluate for bleed/CVA/acute process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
75 year old man with vent-associated pneumonia, CRI on HD,
mental status changes
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for bleed/CVA/acute process
INDICATION: 75-year old male with ventilation associate
pneumonia. Mental status change.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted images of the brain.
MR angiography with time-of-flight technique also performed.

Comparison is made with a prior head CT dated [**2187-6-22**].

FINDINGS: Note is made of mild brain atrophy with mildly
enlarged ventricles. Note is made of multiple areas of T2 high
signal intensities within the deep white matter, representing
chronic small vessel ischemia and old infarction. No evidence of
acute or hyperacute infarction noted on diffusion-weighted
images. No evidence of intracranial mass lesion noted. No mass
effect is seen. No susceptibility abnormality is seen.

On MR angiography, note is made of hypoplastic right vertebral
artery with minimal flow, with probable PICA termination.
Otherwise, no significant stenosis is seen. No evidence of
aneurysm.

IMPRESSION:

MRI: Multiple old infarctions and chronic small vessel ischemia.
No evidence of acute infarction.

MRA: Small right vertebral artery with probable PICA
termination. No evidence of aneurysm or significant stenosis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

The recording began at 9:30 on the morning of [**7-4**]. It
showed a low voltage [**3-30**] Hz slow background in all areas with
occasional
bursts of generalized slowing. There was marginally more focal
slowing
in the right anterior quadrant. Occasional right frontal sharp
waves
appeared less frequent than on the previous day's recording. The

recording did not change significantly over the day.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This EEG monitored cerebral function at the bedside
from
[**9-4**]. It showed an encephalopathic background
throughout.
There were occasional right frontal or anterior quadrant blunted
sharp
waves and additional slowing but no signs of ongoing seizures.
The
encephalopathy was the dominant feature, and it did not change
significantly over the course of the recording.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 75 yoM w/ CRI, CAD s/p CABG X 4, trach/PEG for prolonged
ventilator wean presented with VAP and persistant anemia with
guaiac positive stool.  Hospital course complicated by
deteriorating mental status exacerbated by hypoglycemic episode
[**2187-6-28**] with probable associated seizure activity.  Also
complicated by pneumonia on [**2187-7-10**].

1) Altered mental status:  Decline in mental status
deteriorating to persistent vegetative state.  Multifactorial
cause including uremic encephalopathy, hypoglycemic episode on
[**2187-6-28**], seizure activity, generalized atrophy noted on MRI,
likely reflective of chronic multi-infarct small vessel disease.


Throughout the pt's admission, he became increasingly obtunded.
As compared with his baseling on admission, he became
increasingly unable to interact or communicate with either
hospital staff or his family and became almost completely
unresponsive.  Initially, several etiologic factors were
suspected, chiefly toxic metabolic disease secondary to his
worsening renal function.   Also seizure activity secondary to
prior CVA may have contributed to this, suggested by
epileptogenic foci seen on EEG (although no active seizure was
seen).  CT studies revealed no new mass or bleed, MRI revealed
no new ischemic or vascular disease but did reveal chronic
atrophic changes.
    The patient's mental status showed mild improvement with
hemodialysis.  By the fourth round of hemodialysis the patient
appeared to be aware of other people in the room.  On [**6-28**], per his family, the patient was attempting to mouth words.
Unfortunately, his mental status acutely declined the following
night, becoming again almost completely unresponsive.  His blood
glucose levels was noted to have fallen from 100-150 level to
almost nil within a few hours.
