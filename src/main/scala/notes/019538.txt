Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-10-8**] via transfer
from [**Hospital 1514**] Hospital for surgical management of his coronary
artery disease. He was placed on heparin for anticoagulation.
The cardiac surgical service was consulted and Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. Ciprofloxacin was
started for a urinary tract infection. As he had an episode of
chest pain, intravenous integrillin and nitroglycerin were
started. On [**2188-10-10**], Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three
vessels. Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. He developed atrial fibrillation which was treated
with amiodarone. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. CPAP was used given his
history of sleep apnea and severe COPD. On postoperative day
three, Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was transferred to the step down unit for
further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. On
postoperative day four, Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] had a reaction to percocet
which caused him to be profoundly sedated. Narcan was given with
complete resolution of his symptoms. Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] developed a left
leg cellulitis and keflex was started. An ultrasound was
performed which was negative for a deep vein thrombosis. As his
urine culture remained positive on ciprofloxacin, macrodantin
was used in its place. As his diet improved, his oral diabetes
agents were resumed.

Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
home on [**2188-10-27**]. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician.
