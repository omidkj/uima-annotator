CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Calf claudication bilaterally, left greater
than right.
Left heel rest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 50 year-old female with
known peripheral vascular disease who underwent a left
femoral artery angioplasty and stenting 4 years ago at [**Hospital3 9717**], presents with progressive claudication of the calves
bilaterally, left greater than right. Left heel rest pain
over the last 4 years. The patient's  rest pain is relieved
with dangling her foot.  Symptoms were never totally relieved
from the initial endovascular procedure because it was an
incomplete procedure secondary to dye contrast ATN.  The
patient underwent evaluation with arterial duplex of the
lower extremities which showed occluded left SFA.  An
abdominal CT was done in [**Month (only) 958**] of this year which showed
multiple areas of atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta
and bilateral iliac and external iliac arteries as well as
common femoral arteries. There was apparent focal dissection
in the left distal common femoral artery with extreme
diminutive appearance of the superior portion of the left
superficial femoral artery. There were numerous bilateral
renal lesions too small to characterize, notably the
possibility of mild hyperdense lesions. The patient underwent
a diagnostic arteriogram on [**2152-5-24**]. The angiographic
findings demonstrated patent infrarenal abdominal aorta with
patent bilateral single renal arteries. There were patent
bilateral common internal and external iliac arteries. There
was a widely patent previously placed left common iliac
stent. Left lower extremity runoff revealed a patent common
femoral and profunda femoris arteries. The SFA occludes early
and reconstitutes distally in [**Doctor Last Name 26971**] canal via profunda
collaterals of the above and below knee popliteal and
trifurcation are widely patent. There is 3-vessel runoff down
to the foot with a patent anterior tibial, posterior tibialis
and peroneal artery. The peroneal is of small caliber. On the
right, the right lower extremity runoff revealed patent
common profunda femoris superficial femoral arteries. There
is mild to moderate disease within the right SFA.  The below-
knee popliteal and trifurcation are patent with 3-vessel
runoff to the foot. The patient returns now for
revascularization of the left lower extremity.

but recent exposures have not produced any reactions.

diabetes with triopathy, end-stage renal disease on dialysis
since [**9-/2151**] Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Status post

evacuation. Colonoscopy in the past has confirmed
hemorrhoids.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes cervical conization for
abnormal Pap and a left AV fistula with revision.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with her
husband. The patient is a current smoker, half a pack per day
times 30 years.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for shortness of breath,
cerebrovascular symptoms.  History of angina denied on query
but the pre angio query, she admits to intermittent angina,
relieved with nitroglycerin. Not necessary effort related.
The last cardiac catheterization did not show either surgical
or interventional amenable disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  She is afebrile. Blood
pressure 156/80, pulse 80, respirations 20, oxygen saturation
98% on room air. General appearance:  Alert, co-operative
white female in no acute distress. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Heart is regular rate and rhythm
with no murmur, gallop or rub. There is a left carotid bruit.
Carotid pulses were palpable bilaterally. Abdominal exam
soft, nontender. There is a left iliac bruit. Extremity exam
is without edema. The feet are warm and pink bilaterally
without ulcerations. There are bilateral femoral bruits.
Pulse exam shows palpable femorals bilaterally, right greater
than left. The right popliteal was palpable. The right DP was
palpable and the right PT was a dopplerable biphasic signal.
On the left popliteal, there was an absent pulse.  DP and PT
were dopplerable signals, monophasic. Neurological exam was
nonfocal. The patient was oriented x3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2152-5-7**]. She underwent on
[**2152-5-7**] a left fem AK [**Doctor Last Name **] with PTFE. She tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the PACU with a
palpable graft pulse. She remained hemodynamically stable and
was transferred to the SICU for continued monitoring and
care.  Postoperative day #1: Overnight events. The IV fluids
were Hep-Locked for concern of fluid overload. She was
afebrile. Physical exam was unremarkable. Wounds were clean,
dry and intact and she had dopplerable pedal pulses. The
patient was seen by the renal dialysis service and they
followed her during her hospitalization to manage her
hemodialysis needs. Her diet was advanced as tolerated. The
postoperative hematocrit was 32.1. On postoperative day
number 2, T-max was 101.7 to 100.7.  Pulmonary care was
aggressive. The patient was de-lined.  She was allowed to
ambulate. Physical therapy was requested to see the patient.
They felt that she had good potential for progress to
independence with mobility and anticipate discharge to home.
The patient was assessed with negotiating stairs which she
did well. The remainder of her hospital course was
unremarkable. Her last hemodialysis was on Saturday the 16th.
The patient is discharged to home in stable condition. Wounds
were clean, dry and intact. There is minimal drainage. The
patient should follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in 2 weeks time. A
script for wheelchair for ambulation was written.
