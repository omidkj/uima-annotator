Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
50yo M with non-ischemic, valvular cardiomyopathy (EF 30% on
echo in [**2-27**]), severe AS (s/p valvuloplasty x2), PAF, ESRD on
HD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, PVD, anemia of chronic disease, s/p PEA
with anoxic brain injury tranferred from [**Hospital6 **]
for management of hypotension.
Patient's history notable for complicated admission to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU
from [**2-20**] to [**2121-4-1**]. Briefly, admitted wtih CHF exacerbation
with pulmonary edema. Pt became febrile and develeoped new onset
murmurs. Pt presumed to have endocardititis, TEE was obtained
which showed severe aortic stenosis. Valvuloplasty performed on
[**2-20**] unsuccessful. Second valvuloplasty performed on [**2-21**] which
successfully decreased aortic gradient from 61 to 31 mmHg. After
procedure, pt suffered PEA arrest, was coded for 40min, and had
subsequent anoxic brain injury. Pt underwent prolonged
intubation (1 mo) and was d/c'ed to rehab with plans for f/u of
aortic valve surgery (felt not to be good surgical candidate).
Pt doing well at rehab on HD and lasix for fluid removal. 2d PTA
went on leave from rehab had large salty meal. On return to
rehab, had episode of acute SOB with LH, but no CP. Taken to
[**Hospital3 **] hosp, where found to have mildly decompensated heart
failure with BP's in 80;s-90's. No [**Last Name (un) **] on cardiac w/u. Dialysis
removed another 9kg fluid total over 2d and pressure dropped to
70's; pt started on pressors. Came to [**Hospital1 18**] for mgmt of
hypotension on pressors. MAP 75 on .2mcg/kg/min Levophed. Denies
CP, severe SOB.

Past Medical History:
1) End stage renal dialysis on
hemodialysis. 2) Hypertension. 3) Hypercholesterolemia. 4)
AS, status post valvuloplasty. 5) Congestive heart failure
with ejection fraction of 20 percent with normal coronary
arteries as of [**2121-2-21**]. 6) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin. 7) History of left lower extremity osteomyelitis.
8) History of intravenous drug use. 9) History of hepatis-C.
10) Peripheral vascular disease, status post left below the
knee amputation. 11) Presumed endocarditis, status post
treatment. 12) Right internal jugular thrombosis, status
post thrombolysis. 13) Anoxic brain injury to PEA arrest.
14) History of vasculitis.


Social History:
Lived with wife prior to admission of [**2121-2-20**], at
[**Hospital 38**] Rehab hosp after a long hospitalization. Occ. etoh,

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was evaluated for AVR but
considered not to be a candidate as a result of poor mental
status. Pressure and CHF were controlled in the CCU with
midodrine and HD, and the patient was transferred to the medical
floor. The patient developed a fever to 101.5 on [**7-12**] at which
time his CXR showed worsening RLL infiltrate. He was started on
azitrho/ceftriaxone on [**7-12**] but was switched to vanc/levo/flagyl
on [**7-16**]. On [**7-17**] he had a diagnostic thoracentesis showing no
empyema. Pulmonary was consulted and CT chest was obtained. CT
showed RUL consolidation with large effusion and RML/RLL
atelectasis. On [**2121-7-15**] he developed delirium and neuro was
consulted. Review of his previous MRI scan suggested
microhemorrhages.
On [**2121-7-20**] he devloped acute respiratory distress  with
increased O2 requirements. He was intubated for hypercarbic
respiratory failure and airway protection. On [**2121-7-26**] patient
self-extubated and was electively reintubated on [**2121-7-27**] due to
respiratory distress. On [**2121-7-29**], trach was placed, NGT was
placed and TF's were begun. Towards the last week of his
hospitalization, the patient and his family had many discussions
with housestaff re: the patient's goals on discharge. Palliative
care, social work, and case managment was also involved. The
patient was clear in his wishes to return home and not to a
chronic vent facility but had difficulty with accepting end of
life care. It was discussed that he would not be able to have HD
at home. After several days of discussion, he chose to return
home on a ventilator and forego hemodialysis, knowing that this
meant end of life care. The pt's daughter and son were trained
on a home vent, and pain control and patient comfort in the
hospital were priority goals. The patient wished to eat in the
hospital, despite numerous sessions advising him not to do so
given the high risk of aspiration. After the pt decided on end
of life care, he decided to eat in the hospital. The patient and
family were coached in eating only very small amounts, with
aspiration precautions. Hemodialysis was continued while the
patient remained in the hospital.
On [**2121-8-5**], the patient was d/c'ed to home on ventilator,
without hemodialysis, with medications only intended for comfort
and pain relief, eating a full diet knowing of the aspiration
risk, with home services. The patient was d/c'ed on no po or IV
meds, intended for end of life care.
