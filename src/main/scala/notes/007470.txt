Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
83 year-old Spanish-speaking female with a history of
hypercarbic respiratory failure, HTN, chronic diastolic heart
failure, diabetes mellitus type II, and history of CVA who
presents with AMS and SOB.

She lives at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and she was noted to be "restless,
sweating, twitching, and difficulty breathing."  Per report she
had been having increasing fatigue, AMS, and shortness of breath
since the afternoon.  She had finger-stick blood glucose in the
50's at some point today and was given juice.  EMS was called
this evening.  EMS found her to have O2 sat 83% on 3L, 88% on
NRB with blood glucose 106 after juice.  She was then
transferred to the ED.

In the ED, initial VS were HR 83, BP 130/67, RR 12, O2 sat 88%
on NRB.  On exam she would occasionally follow commands but was
very somnolent.  She was intubated and started on a propofol
gtt.  NGT was placed.  CXR showed bilateral patchy opacities.
ETT pulled back slightly since that film.  She was given
vancomycin and levaquin.  ABG after intubation was
7.40/66/456/42/13.  Other labs were notable for K 6.4, Cl 89,
Bicarb 34, BUN 62, Creat 1.4, WBC 10.9.  She was given
kayexelate and repeat K was 5.8.  Lactate was 1.6.  CT head was
done which showed no acute intracranial process.  She was
admitted to the ICU.

This is the third time she has been intubated.

Review of systems: Unable to be obtained in the ICU.

On the floor, patient is now feeling back to her baseline.  She
denies fevers, chills, chest pain.  Still has shortness of
breath, wheezing, but this is her baseline.  Denies abdominal
pain.  Per HPI otherwise all other review of systems is
negative.

Past Medical History:

History of CVA with residual dysarthria
Depression
Spinal stenosis (lumbar)
Peripheral vascular disease

use.  Originally from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**], moved to USA [**2148**].  She has 7

Physical Exam:
ICU EXAMINATION [**2192-3-24**]:
Vitals: 97.6 78 166/49 14 100% AC
General: Intubated, sedation, appears comfortable
HEENT: PERRL but slightly constricted, sclera anicteric, MM
slightly dry, ETT in place, OG tube present
Neck: Supple, JVP unable to assess
Lungs: Ventilated breath sounds clear bilaterally, no wheezes,
rales, rhonchi anteriorly but unable to listen posteriorly
CV: Regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds but no
audible murmurs
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, protuberant but non-distended, bowel
sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding obvious, no
organomegaly
GU: Foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, faint pulses, chronic skin changes but
no edema

FLOOR EXAM [**2192-3-26**]:
VS: T 98.9, BP 124/79, HR 74, RR 20, O2sat 96% on 3L
GEN: NAD, obese, not in respiratory distress
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM
NECK: Supple
CHEST: + Wheezes and some rhonchi diffusely
CV: RRR, normal s1 and s2
ABD:  Soft, nontender, bowel sounds normal
EXT: No lower extremity edema
NEURO: Alert, oriented x3, CN 2-12 intact, sensory intact
throughout, [**4-5**] BUE/BLE strength, fluent speech
PSYCH: Calm, appropriate

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**2192-3-24**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Left atrial
abnormality. Right bundle-branch block. Inferior wall myocardial
infarction. Low precordial voltage. Since the previous tracing
there is probably no significant change.
.
IMAGING:
[**3-25**] CXR: Comparison with the previous study done [**2192-3-24**].
Prominent
interstitial markings persist. Streaky bilateral densities
consistent with
subsegmental atelectasis are unchanged, as is blunting of the
left
costophrenic sulcus. Mediastinal structures are unchanged. An
endotracheal
tube, nasogastric tube and PICC line remain in place.
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.
.
CXR [**3-26**] CXR-FINDINGS: Lung volumes are decreased, and as
expected, this has worsened since [**2192-3-25**] when the patient was
intubated. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis is worse in the
right side. Hazy opacities in both lungs,
particularly in the right side are consistent with edema.
Mildcardiomegaly
is unchanged since [**2192-3-24**].
Mid thoracic spine degenerative disc disease is moderately
severe.
IMPRESSION:
1. Decreased lung volumes and atelectasis.
2. Probable pulmonary edema.
.
[**3-24**] CT HEAD:
1. No acute intracranial process. Chronic atrophy and remote
right PCA
infarct.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus and mastoid opacification
post-intubation.
Please correlate clinically for mastoiditis.
