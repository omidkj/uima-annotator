.
[**2173-6-15**] CT abdomen and pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. 7 x 11 mm obstructing stone in the left proximal ureter, just
distal to
the UPJ with mild hydronephrosis.
2. Multiple small non-obstructing stones in both kidneys.
3. Status post cholecystectomy. Unremarkable appearance of the
small and
large bowel, without evidence for obstruction or bowel wall
thickening.
4. 7-mm pulmonary nodule at the left lower lobe; recommend three
or six-month imaging followup if the patient is at high or low
risk for intrathoracic malignancy, respectively.
.
[**2173-6-16**] Echocardiogram:
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
regional with mild global hypokinesis. Right ventricular free
wall hypertrophy. In the absence of a history of systemic
hypertension, an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid,
[**Location (un) 4223**]-Fabry's) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be
considered.
If clinically indicated, a cardiac MRI ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**]) may be
useful to discriminate among these etiologies.
.
Blood cultures: NGTD

Brief Hospital Course:
49 yo M with diabetes, HTN, CHF, presents with worsening left
abdominal pain, found to have obstructive kidney stone.
.
# Pyelonephritis/Obstructing nephrolithiasis: Patient admitted
with 5 days of LLQ pain, nausea and vomiting with a large
obstructing stone and left-sided hydronephrosis on CT scan.  He
was started on IV ciprofloxacin 400mg [**Hospital1 **] in case of infection,
tamsulosin to aid with relaxation of the ureter and IV morphine
for pain control.  He appeared euvolemic and well-compensated in
terms of his heart failure, so he was hydrated with normal
saline to prevent further stones from obstructing. He was taken
[**2173-6-16**] by urology for ureteral stent placement to relieve the
pressure on the kidney.
.
ICU COURSE: Pt underwent cystoscopy and ureteral stent placement
on [**6-16**] w/ post-procedure course complicated by purulent
drainage s/p stenting and subsequent fevers to 102.6, relative
hypotension to 107/60, and tachycardia to 110s. He received 1 L
LR and 900 mcg phenylephrine during the procedure. Ampicillin
and gentamicin had been administered prior to the procedure.
Given concern for developing sepsis and reported history of
significant cardiomyopathy with LVEF 10-15%, pt was transferred
to ICU for further hemodynamic monitoring. Upon arrival to ICU
pt was 92% on 5L NC which quickly improved and pt was soon able
to sat in mid-90s on RA, making the most likley diagnosis
post-procedure atelectasis. Aspiration events, complications of
intubation, PTX and PE were all considered in the differential
but based on imaging and rapid improvement of pts system, most
likely cause was atelectasis. Pt improved and was transferred
back to general medical service on [**6-17**], put on empiric Zosyn.
.
Patient continued to improve and cultures remained negative.
Given lack of past culture data, he was changed to Augmentin at
the advice of urology.  He must complete a 14 day course total
of antibiotic therapy.  He must follow up with urology in 10
days for definitive management of his nephrolithiasis.  Flomax
to be continued at discharge
.
# Chronic systolic CHF: new diagnosis in [**3-/2172**] per patient with
EF of [**11-5**]% at that time.  s/p biopsy and cath at the [**Hospital1 756**],
all negative per pt.  Very well compensated on admission, lying
flat comfortably with no edema, JVP not elevated even after 1L
in ED.  His Lasix was held on admission, as the elevated Cr and
lactate were thought to be in part dehydration.  Repeat echo was
done, showing an EF of 45% with global mild hypokinesis.  In the
absence of a history of systemic hypertension, an infiltrative
process (e.g., amyloid, [**Location (un) 4223**]-Fabry's) or hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy should be considered.  A prior cardiac biopsy at
[**Hospital1 112**] was reportedly nondiagnostic.  If clinically indicated, a
cardiac MRI may be useful to discriminate among these
etiologies.  His ACE-I was held given his ARF.  Lasix restarted
at discharge
.
# Acute renal failure: Cr up to 2.1 from baseline 1.2-1.4,
likely a combination of pre-renal from dehydration and
post-renal from unilateral obstruction.  Improved with hydration
and relief of the obstruction.  His ACE-I and lasix were held
initially, but his creatinine returned to baseline by discharge,
so these were resumed.
.
# Type 2 Diabetes mellitus: Continued on home lantus.  Metformin
held given CT scan and ARF and covered with a humalog SS.
Metformin held at discharge pending resolution of his ARF.
.
# Pulmonary nodule: CTA abd/pelvis showed a 7-mm pulmonary
nodule at the left lower lobe.  Recommended for three or
six-month imaging followup if the patient is at high or low risk
for intrathoracic malignancy, respectively.
