Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from [**Location (un) 62562**] Hospital for repeat
bronchoscopy for possible tracheal stenosis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with replacement of the tracheostomy tube

History of Present Illness:
89yoF with h/o CHF, ?COPD, s/p aortic valve replacement in [**2181**],
PAF, s/p trach for failure to wean on chronic ventilator support
who presented to [**Location (un) 62562**] Hospital on [**2185-12-15**] with
hypoxemia and high peak airway pressures.  Per OSH admission
history and physical, her ventilator started alarming on
[**2185-12-14**] for "high pressure."  Her daughter called the
ventilator company who instructed her to attempt "some
maneuvers" which apparently did not stop the vent from alarming.
 Thus, she presented to OSH thereafter.
.
In the ED at OSH, respiratory staff [**Date Range 4351**] had difficulty
bagging her and initially suspected mucous plug, however they
were unable to suction significant secretions and peak pressures
remained high.  She was admitted to the ICU there where she is
apparently well known for multiple admissions.  She underwent
brochoscopy this am, however, they were unable to pass the
bronchoscope beyond the trach (distal portion of trach with 1/3
occlusion) thought to be obstructed by either mucous plug or
more likely granulation tissue.  She is now being transferred
for IP procedure.
.
Additionally of note, at OSH, WBC count was noted to be elevated
to 20.7 and she was started on zosyn for unclear source,
presumably respiratory.  Per her daughter, she has been "in and
out of the hospital" recently; she was discharged from [**Hospital **]
rehab in [**2185-8-20**] on trach collar during the day and AC
overnight.  She was again admitted to [**University/College 23925**] [**Location (un) **] for 2
months (discharged [**2185-10-19**]) for CHF ?in the setting of a.fib
with RVR at which time she was discharged to home on chronic AC
mechanical ventilation.  She was again admitted last week for
chest pain at which time her daughter reports workup was
negative.  Also, her daughter notes that she has grown both MRSA
and pseudomonas in her sputum and doctors have told [**Name5 (PTitle) **] this was
[**1-21**] to colonization, not infection although her daughter
apparently requested course of ciprofloxacin x 1 week (stopped 2
days early by daughter [**1-21**] "rash" on back).
.
Currently denies fevers/chills, no rigors.  She does endorse
perhaps some mild increase in secretions which she reports she
is able to clear well on her own (daughter needs to suction
infrequently and does not believe secretions are significantly
increased), no hemoptysis, no shortness of breath.  No chest
pain, palpitations.
.
Further ROS:  Denies HA, changes in vision.  No changes in
weight.  No N/V/diarrhea.  No blood in stool.  No
dysuria/hematuria.  No rashes, joint pain.  She reports chronic
diffuse weakness and rigidity since her CVA and since being
bedbound.  Wears hearing aid.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Chronic Ventillator-Dependent Respiratory Failure:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4318**] is chronically on mechanical ventilation since [**2183**]
and has failed mutliple attempts at weaning.  The underlying
etiology of her respiratory failure is not entirely clear;
however, her daughter reports CHF and the patient's records give
a history of COPD (although her daughter denies this history,
and the patient has no history of smoking).

Bronchoscopy the morning of [**2185-12-16**] at [**Doctor Last Name 62565**]
Hospital showed an obstruction distal to the ET tube, thought to
be either a mucous plug, granulation tissue or other mass.  She
was transiently hypoxic with O2 sats in the high 80s just after
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], but her oxygen saturations quickly increased
to the mid to high 90s on assist-control mode at 40% FiO2.  On
[**2185-12-17**] at [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent a rigid bronchoscopy, which
showed tracheomalacia just distal to the end of the tracheostomy
tube (there was no evidence of granulation tissue).  Her
original tracheostomy tube was exchanged for a longer tube (size
7, advanced 9.5 cm) that ended distally to the trac
