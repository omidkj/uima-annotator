[**5-6**]. Ambulating independently.
Head incision is C/D/I

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**11-5**]: Large mass centered at the suprasellar cistern
with associated mass-effect resulting in ventriculomegaly of the
third and lateral ventricles. Differential is still broad at
this point, would recommend MRI for further
characterization

MRI brain [**11-5**]:
Large heterogeneously enhancing mass centered within the
prepontine cistern arising from, or invading into, the clivus.
There is
significant mass effect with associated moderate hydrocephalus.
Despite the significant degree of mass effect, there is no
significant parenchymal edema. The findings are suggestive of a
chordoma, with additional less likely considerations to include
Chondrosarcoma, or plasmacytoma .

CT head post-op [**11-7**]: (Post-op)
Stable compression of brain stem, unchanged since the recent
prior.
Interval decrease in the ventricular size. If there is a high
clinical
suspicion for acute infarction, MRI can be performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95713**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2127-11-5**]. He underwent CT and
MRI imaging which revealed a large suprasellar mass. He was
being monitored in the ICU. He was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who
recommened a CT guided stereotactic biopsy. Frozen section
revealed chordoma. He had a VP shunt placed with stereotactic
guidance. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 93337**] from General Surgery performed the
laparoscopic guided catheter placement. He had a post-op CT scan
that showed no hemorrhage. He was extubated and transfered to
the SICU.

Endocrinology was consulted. They did not find any lb
adnormalities nor sign of pituitary dysfunction. The serum
cortisol was**** Opthamology was consulted and they found no
visual field cut on bedside exam. We will arrange for outpatient
formal visual field testing. He was transfered to the floor on
[**2127-11-7**]. His diet was advanced and he was transitioning out of
