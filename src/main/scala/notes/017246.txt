Admission Date:  [**2132-4-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-4-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2093-10-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 38-year-old woman with
long history of pulmonary problems dating back to her
diagnosis and subsequent treatment of Hodgkin's disease.
In [**2115**], she was treated with MOPP and XRT, and has had long
course thereafter complicated by ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis,
histoplasmosis, Aspergillosis, requiring left pneumonectomy,
tuberculosis, and placement of tracheostomy.  She is on
nocturnal home ventilation for chronic respiratory failure.

She was seeming to improve over the recent months until about
one month prior to admission, when she noted onset of allergy
symptoms (i.e., nasal congestion, increased pulmonary
secretions from the trach).  She was treated with Augmentin
with some initial improvement in symptoms.  However, the last
two weeks prior to admission, she noted increasing shortness
of breath, edema, and weight gain.  Her po Lasix was
increased from 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 120 mg q am and 80 mg q pm,
without significant improvement.  She denies any chest pain,
fevers, chills, or palpitations.

She was seen in Pulmonary Clinic early on the day of
admission, where she was noted to have oxygen saturations
down to the 70s with minimal exertion, despite 10 liters of
trach mask.  She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive
Care Unit for further evaluation and management.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Iron.
2. Vitamin C.
3. Ativan.
4. Lasix as above.
5. Aldactone 100 mg q day.
6. Seroquel 25 mg q am and q noon, 50 mg q hs.
7. Celexa 15 mg q am.
8. Calcium.
9. Clarinex.
10. Protonix.
11. Remeron 15 mg q hs.
12. Lactulose.
13. Flovent.
14. Atrovent.
15. Serevent.
16. Albuterol.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs show a temperature of
97.0, heart rate of 101, blood pressure 82/45, sats are 91%
on 10 liters trach mask, respiratory rate was 22.  In
general, she was chronically ill and fatigued appearing.  She
was unable to talk secondary to the trache.  HEENT showed
anicteric sclerae, reactive pupils.  Mucous membranes are
moist without oral lesions.  Neck was supple with positive
jugular venous distention.  Lungs revealed absent breath
sounds on the left status post pneumonectomy.  There were
basilar crackles and coarse rhonchi on the right.  Heart was
tachycardic and regular, S1, S2, positive S3, and no S4.
There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur at the apex radiating
to the axilla.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities showed 2+ pitting
edema in both lower extremities.  There is no clubbing,
cyanosis, calf tenderness, erythema, or palpable cords.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Complete blood count with white
count 17.4, hematocrit 43.7, platelets 380.  Chem-7 shows a
sodium of 130, potassium 4.9, chloride 72, bicarb 45, BUN 24,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 99. Calcium, magnesium, and
phosphorus were within normal limits.  LFTs were within
normal limits.  CK on admission was 27 with a troponin that
was less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray showed a small right pleural effusion and
increased interstitial markings on the right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]
Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and treatment for
her increasing shortness of breath.  However, interventions
were limited by her concurrent severe hypotension, with her
systolic blood pressure running at baseline from the 70s to
80s.  Given that, IV Lasix was initially attempted to treat
her congestive heart failure, without significant
improvement.  Thereafter, she was given a trial of dopamine
with concomitant Swan-Ganz monitoring.  However, the patient
showed no significant improvement in objective or subjective
parameters while on pressors, and the dopamine was weaned
off.  Her cardiac output and cardiac index remained dismal
both on and off dopamine.  Given her hypotension, it was not
felt that Natrecor, other pressors, or Flolan could be
reasonable options at this point.

Given the lack of progress, her overall poor prognosis, and
her severe symptomatology, her pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**], sat down with the patient and her family and
spoke with her about the poor prognosis and small likelihood
for meaningful recovery at this point.  After their
discussion, it was felt that the patient would like to return
home with home hospice.  Arrangements were in the process of
being made for such when the patient continued to spiral
downward clinically, with worsening blood pressures.  Given
the direction of her care at that point and the small
likelihood for any meaningful recovery, further pressors were
not attempted.  The patient expired on [**2132-4-28**].

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE/DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.
