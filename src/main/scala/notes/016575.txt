History of Present Illness:
46 yo m s/p CRT, hypertension, known to the MICU team after he
was recently admitted with respiratory distress and hypotension,
found to have likely MSSA pna complicated by septic shock who
now returns to the ICU with melena and a hematocrit drop.
.
Briefly, the patient [**Hospital 106884**] transferred from an OSH after
he presented with tachycardia and hypotension following
approximately one week of dry cough and URI symptoms. He was
intubated due to respiratory failure (unclear if
hypoxic/hypercarbic). Additionally, noted to be in acute on
chronic renal failure. He was treated for possible cardiogenic
shock (given troponin leak, and renal failure) and diuresed. The
patient transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU on [**2179-12-22**] with
respiratory failure, ARF, and vasopresser dependent hypotension.
He was felt to likely be in septic shock in the setting of a
PNA. He was started on stress dose steroids and
vancomycin/zosyn. Patient was titrated off pressers within the
first 24 hours. Bronchoscopy on [**12-23**] showed edematous airways
and scant purulent sputum in the LUL. BAL samples grew MSSA from
2 samples (Moraxella from one). Blood cultures from [**12-22**] grew
out coag neg staph, 2 different species, from 1 from each of 6
bottles. 1 bottle also grew Peptostreptococcus. Extubated on
[**12-25**] without complications. Maintained on CVVHD
(anuric/oliguric). Initially treated with vancomycin and zosyn
until [**12-27**], changed to nafcillin. Clindamycin added [**12-28**].
.
He was subsequently transferred to the floor on [**12-29**] where he
developed a low grade fever to 100.5 and initially had low grade
diarrhea (not tested for fecal occult blood at that time. On
[**12-30**] he was febrile to 101.0 and had onset of "explosive" bowel
movement which was noted to be melanotic (and FOBT positive).
CBC that morning showed an 8 pt hematocrit drop. By report, the
patient had coffee grounds draining NGT following intubation at
OSH. Patient denied abdominal pain and denied
fevers/post-prandial abd pain/n/v/d prior to hospitalization.
Other than the development of diarrhea and fever over 30 hours
prior to MICU transfer, the patient had been asymptomatic. He
also denied LH/CP/SOB.
.
In the MICU, he had an EGD which revealed normal mucosa in the
esophagus; Thick gastric folds; ulcers in the duodenal bulb and
second part of the duodenum (thermal therapy, injection);
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum. He received
12 units of blood and his HCT finally stabilized 28-30 s/p
cauterization. Renal evaluated him and decided on HD for [**1-2**].
Wound cultures on the L subclavian tunnelled cath were sent for
concern of infected site. Dilt and BB were restarted.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during

initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

Radiology/studies:
* EKG ([**12-22**]): Poor quality tracing. Probable atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Since the
previous tracing of [**2175-9-12**] atrial fibrillation is new. QRS
voltage in the precordial leads may be increased. Clinical
correlation is suggested.
