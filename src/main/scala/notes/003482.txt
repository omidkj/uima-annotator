Pertinent Results:
[**2185-5-20**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated a normal LMCA. The LAD had a
50-60% stenosis in its mid portion. The LCX was normal. The RCA
had luminal irregularities but no angiographically significant
CAD. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed markedly elevated right
ventricular pressures; RV systolic pressure was 85-90 mmHg and
RV filling presure was 18 mmHg. There was a 60-70 mmHg gradient
between RV and PA. Systemic arterial pressures were normal; LV
filling pressure was mildly elevated. 3. There was a 60-mmHg
gradient at/across the pulmonic valve. There was trivial mitral
regurgitation. Aortography did not demonstrate any significant
AI.
[**2185-5-23**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is normal in size.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 3. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. 4. The aortic root is
moderately dilated athe sinus level. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 7. There is
severe pulmonic valve stenosis. 8. There is no pericardial
effusion. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient
was receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine 1. A
bioprosthesis is well seated in the pulmonic position. No
significant PR
is seen. Visualization of the valve was suboptimal. 2.
Biventricular function is preserved. 3. Other findings are
unchanged.
[**5-26**] CXR: There is no pneumothorax or increased pleural effusion
after removal of two chest tubes. There is improvement in the
aeration of the bases bilaterally with still residual linear
atelectasis present in the right lung. The heart size and
mediastinal contours are unchanged. The replaced pulmonary valve
is demonstrated. The lucency between the sternal areas is again
noted. The patient's radiograph doesn't demonstrate evidence of
congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 69843**] was admitted pre-operatively to undergo cardiac
cath and other work-up prior to surgery. On [**5-23**] he was then
brought to the operating room where he underwent redo,
redo-sternotomy, Pulmonic Valve Replacement, and Right
Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta blockers and diuretics and diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. Later on this day he was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. On post-op day two his
mediastinal chest tubes were removed and on post-op day three he
pleural chest tubes were removed. Also on post-op day three his
epicardial pacing wires were removed. His medication were
titrated for maximum hemodynamics and he worked with physical
therapy for strength and mobility. He did require aggressive
pulmonary toilet and needed oxygen via nasal cannula for several
days to maintain his oxygen saturation above 93%. This was
slowly weaned and he was discharged home on post-operative day
four with the appropriate meds and follow-up appointments.
