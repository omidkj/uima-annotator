History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42306**] is a 39 year old male with a history of ETOH abuse
for the last 6 months who presented to an outside hospital on
[**2191-2-19**] following a week of heavy binge drinking. The patient
reports that he had been drinking at least a half liter of
whiskey daily for the week leading up to admission and had
noticed his skin becoming more jaundiced. He had been eating
little during this time and noticed that he was very weak and
could barely walk which prompted him to call an ambulance which
took him to the OSH.

At the OSH patient received serax for withdrawl at time of
admission. He was initially admitted to the floor but
transferred to the ICU when he was noted to become increasingly
somnolent. Patient's Hct noted to drop from 35 on admission to
26 on [**2-21**] which prompted concern for an active bleed. Patient
was noted to be hypercoaguable with an INR of 4. He was given
Vitamin K on admission and also received FFP prior to an EGD on
[**2-22**] for r/o UGIB. On EGD patient noted to have a duodenal ulcer
with a clear base. He was started on a PPI. Patient also had U/S
with ? portal vein thrombosis. OSH also concerned for SBP though
no paracentesis was performed and it is unclear whether he was
febrile. He was started on ceftriaxone which was switched to
cipro. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management
of his liver disease and ? PVT.

Past Medical History:
- EtOH abuse: pt reports heavy drinking x 6 months. Prior to
this he would drink [**1-1**] drinks with dinner. He was in detox at
[**Hospital 8**] hospital for two weeks in [**1-7**]. Per OSH records he has
a hx of DTs.
- ? Acute pancreatitis due to alcohol use
- Hypertension
- IBS

IMAGING STUDIES:

CTA ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2-24**]:
1. No evidence of venous thrombosis.
2. Organizing fluid collection in the left anterior pararenal
space from subacute pancreatitis, still active within the tail.
3. Mild pancreatic duct dilation in the body and tail is likely
related to
the sequela of pancreatitis, although MRCP after the patient's
symptoms have resolved can be obtained to evaluate .
4. Diffusely fatty liver. No biliary pathology to explain
hyperbilirubinemia.

LIVER CORE BIOPSY [**2-25**]
Liver, core needle biopsy:
1)  Severe macrovesicular steatosis with frequent ballooning
degeneration; no definitive [**Doctor First Name 68085**] hyaline is seen.
2)  Portal and lobular predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate.
3)  Bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils.
4)  Focal portal venous thrombosis with organization.
5)  Mild cholestasis.
6)  Mild portal fibrosis, no significant sinusoidal fibrosis
(trichrome).
7)  Mild iron deposition seen predominantly in Kupffer cells
(iron stain).

MRA/MRV BRAIN [**2-25**]:
FINDINGS: MRA HEAD:
The arteries of anterior and posterior circulation demonstrate
normal flow
signal without stenosis or occlusion. No aneurysm greater than 3
mm in size
is seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
MRV OF THE HEAD:
The head MRV demonstrates normal flow in the superior sagittal
and transverse sinuses as well as in the deep venous system.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRV of the head.

MRI ABDOMEN [**3-4**]:
1. Minimal decrease in size of left retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Decreased signal intensity in the pancreas, which may be due
to
pancreatitis. Suspect a phlegmon adjacent to the tail (not
significantly
changed vs. prior).
3. Fatty liver without evidence of biliary ductal dilatation. No
evidence of gallstones or choledocholithiasis.

CXR [**3-13**]:
The heart size is normal. Mediastinal position, contour and
width are
unremarkable. The lung volumes are significantly better compared
to the prior study with improvement of bibasal atelectasis. The
current study demonstrates what appears to be a new opacity at
the left lower lung in the left infrahilar area that might
represent a focus of aspiration or developing infection.
Attention to this area on the subsequent studies is highly
recommended. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
demonstrated.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND [**3-13**]:
Large amount of subcutaneous edema noted bilaterally in the
calves. No evidence of DVT seen in either lower extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 39 year-old man with history of EtOH abuse without known
cirrhosis, who was originally admitted to OSH with likely
alcoholic hepatitis, now transferred for further management.

# Acute Hepatitis
He underwent a liver biopsy shortly after admission. Pathology
was consistent with acute alcoholic hepatitis (see full report
above). There was no evidence of cirrhosis. CTA at admission
showed no portal vein thrombosis. His liver enzymes were
followed daily and bilirubin rose to peak at 38. Prednisone was
started when he did not improve with supportive management.
However, due to the development of fevers and infection,
prednisone was stopped after only three days. As his liver
function worsened, he developed symptoms of hepatic
encephalopathy, abdominal distention, lower extremity swelling,
and diffuse pruritis from hyperbilirubinemia. His encephalopathy
was treated with
