Chief Complaint:
rectal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy

GI bleeding study


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 77 year old female with a past medical history
significant for GI bleeding secondary to arteriovenous
malformations, who presents with maroon stool and a hematocrit
drop. Three days ago began to develop black stools. There was no
clear blood in the toilet bowl. In addition, she developed
nausea and decreased PO intake. She had a cough productive of
white sputum and felt warm, although she did not record her
temperature. At dialysis on day of admission, she related these
symptoms for the first time and had a bloody bowel movement.
Concerned, the staff sent her directly to the [**Hospital1 18**].  In the ED,
her temperature was 96.5, HR 51, BP 112/60, RR 18, and oxygen
saturation was 98% on ambient air. Her hematocrit was measured
at 23.5, while her baseline hematocrit is in the low 30s. An NG
lavage was performed and there was bilious return. Rectal
examination was notable for guiaiac positive maroon stool.
She was type and crossed and transfused two units of packed red
blood cells. IV PPI was given and the GI team was consulted and
she was scheduled for colonoscopy and EGD on the morning of [**7-5**].
She was transferred to the MICU for observation.

   HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2120-7-8**]):
      NEGATIVE BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).

GI bleed study - IMPRESSION:
Active radiotracer activity in the right lower quadrant in a
serpingneous f
fashion suggestive of distal small bowel.

EGD - Impression: Angioectasias in the fundus
Angioectasias in the antrum
Angioectasias in the proximal jejunum and mid jejunum
Angioectasia in the duodenum
Otherwise normal small bowel enteroscopy to mid jejunum
Recommendations: No site of active bleeding was seen.
The fundal AVMs are a potential site of bleeding although do not
explain the extent of bleeding.
Consider endoscopic argon plasma therapy
Proceed with colonoscopy.

Colonoscopy -
Impression: Blood in the colon
Grade 1 external hemorrhoids
Angioectasia in the colon
Diverticulosis of the colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum


Brief Hospital Course:
Blood loss anemia from GI bleeding - the bleeding was likely
from an AVM. EGD, colonoscopy and tagged scan results as above.
eventhough uptake was noted in the rt LQ, no clear site of
bleeding was noticed on colonoscopy. hence, no intervention was
performed. she was transfused with 5 units of PRBC in the ICU
andsent to the [**Hospital1 **]. Her hematocrit remained stable for 4 days
prior to discharge. No further bleeding noted. GI consult team
followed pt in hospital. On discussion with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10689**] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3708**]
from GI - they recommended that she follow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
consideration of argon photocoagulation as out-patient. Given
the innumerable number of AVM's, it is diffcult to assess which
the culprit lesion is and GI may start APL from the fundus of
stomach.

Patient to get CBC checked with PCP this week as below. ASA was
held and may be restarted if Hct stable in clinic at the PCP's
discretion.

Chronic thrombocytopenia was noted, however the patient did not
require platelet transfusions. Has a h/o HIT.

The metoprolol was held during acute bleeding phase and
restarted prior to discharge as her BP stabilized.

Other medical problems stable. Dialysis was continued 3/week.

I personally talked with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 20670**] at the time of discharge to
update him with the hospital events.
