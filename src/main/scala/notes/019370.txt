Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal.
There is mild-to-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(ejection
fraction 40 percent). The right ventricular cavity is dilated.
Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
is no
pericardial effusion.

Head CT:There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. Ventricles are
not dilated. There is no shift of intracranial structures

C-spine CT:IMPRESSION: No cervical fracture or subluxation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and had an emergency echocardiogram in the ED.
It showed an approximate EF of 40%, and global hypokinesis.  No
structural disease.
1. Cardiac: He was intubated initially, but began to wake up and
was eventually extubated without issue.  In the ED, he was in
sinus rhythm with no evidence of ischemia, hypertrophy, or
prolonged intervals.  He was taken to the cath lab and had
angiography.  His coronaries were normal, with the exception of
an anomalous RCA that originated from the left cusp. This was
not felt to be a likely cause of his VF arrest.  He was then
taken to the EP lab, where he had an ICD placed without
incident.  From this point, he had no additional events on
telemetry and had stable cardiac function.  As far as the
etiology of this event, it was never fully discerned.  PE was
not found, coronaries not likely to be cause, tox screens
negative, no structural issues on echo, no family hx.  After
transferring to the floor, the patient remained stable as above
and was sent home with close follow-up with the device clinic
here.  He will also see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in cardiology in 1 month.
Given instructions to return if he feels ICD discharge and to
not drive for 6 months.

2.Neuro: He was down for about 15 minutes per his wife.  Unclear
how long he was totally hypoxic during this time.  He has no
obvious neurological deficits after this.  He is at his baseline
of thinking and functioning per his family.  He doesn't remember
the event and much of the early hospital course, but is
otherwise intact.  He complained of some mild lightheadedness,
but it was not interfering with his functioning.  He thought it
was likely result of being in bed for several days.  Gave him
the number of Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], in case he was interested in
seeing a neurologist.

3.Follow-up: He will see his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 1 week, and come back to the
device clinic in 1 week.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 month.

4.EP:He will go out and use his left arm lightly until site
heals.  Also, we will send him on 5 days of Keflex due to his
device placement.  He was afebrile throughout.

5.Asthma: Stable during hospitalization.  No issues.

Medications on Admission:
1.Albuterol prn

Discharge Medications:
1. Cephalexin 500 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every
6 hours) for 5 days.
Disp:*20 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*


Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest


Discharge Condition:
Pt was stable with normal vitals for several days.Eating and
drinking normally.No change in baseline mental
status/functioning.

Discharge Instructions:
Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you feel
overly short of breath, experience chest pain that is not
related to soreness over your ICD, or you have a fever.

You can stop using your sling, but use your left arm only for
light activity for 1-2 weeks.

No driving for 6 months.
