[**2148-10-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Markedly limited study as above.
Bilateral atelectasis again noted and relatively stable with no
definite focal consolidation or signs of failure.
.
[**2148-10-6**] Abdominal U/S: ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND
HISTORY: 42-year-old male with liver failure and worsening
ascites.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2148-9-10**].
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND: The study is limited due to patient's
difficulty
cooperating with the exam and holding his breath, as well as
ascites and
abdominal tenderness. The liver remains nodular and
heterogeneous consistent with cirrhosis. There is a moderate to
large amount of ascites. Flow is identified within a segment of
the main portal vein, although the main portal vein is not
completely visualized. There is no hydronephrosis. The pancreas
and aorta are not well seen due to bowel gas. The spleen is
enlarged, measuring 13.3 cm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal visualization of the portal vein due to technical
difficulties with the exam. Flow is identified within portion of
the main portal vein. 2. Ascites, cirrhosis and splenomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Goals of care: In the setting of worsening liver failure,
prolonged encephalopathy and removal from the [**Year (4 digits) **] list
the patient, his mother and health care team held a goals of
care meeting ([**2148-10-16**]). With discussion of the current
situation and prognosis it was decided to make the patient
comfort measures only. His mother was agreeable with this
decision. He was sent home with hospice care.
.
#. Culture Negative Peritonitis: The patient was admitted to the
MICU with leukocytosis, tachycardia, AMS and abdominal pain. He
had a diagnostic paracentesis which revealed SBP. He was started
on IV vanc/zosyn/flagyl and given albumin per protocol. Later he
was switched to IV vanc/ceftriaxone/flagyl. Abdominal ultrasound
showed patent portal vein, ascites and stable cirrhosis. Mental
status improved slightly with antibiotics. Upon transfer to
floor a repeat diagnostic paracentesis was performed
demonstrating continued SBP. Vancomycin was stopped and IV
ceftriaxone and flagyl were continued for a total course of 10
days. A repeat paracentesis showed resolution of the SBP. The
patient was started on PO bactrim for SBP prophylaxis.
.
#. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient was treated with his home
dose of lactulose and rifaximin and had [**3-25**] bowel movements per
day. His mental status improved but did not return to baseline.
.
#. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient had an increased Cr to 1.5.
He was treated for hepatorenal syndrome with albumin, midodrine
and octreotide. His serum Cr improved to 1.2.
.
# ESLD: The patient was continued on his lactulose and rifaximin
doses. Diuretics were held in the setting of suspected infection
and then in the setting of hepatorenal syndrome. The patient is
currently inactive on the [**Month/Day (3) **] list. The patient had
worsening liver function tests and INR despite vitamin K
therapy.
.
# Coagulopathy: The patient had elevated INR and low platelets
in the setting of ESLD. He was treated with vitamin K PO in the
setting of antibiotic use and malnutrition.
.
# Tachycardia: Patient had sinus tachycardia to 110 on arrival
to the floor. He had one episode of SVT with a rate in the
170's. Metoprolol 5mg IV was given and the patient returned to
sinus rhythm with a rate of 90. Blood pressure was stable and
the patient was asymptomatic.
