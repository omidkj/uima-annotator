Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF, increasing DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AVR/cabg x1   [**2179-6-17**]   (21mm St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9041**] porcine valve, SVG
to OM)


History of Present Illness:
67 yo male with metastatic renal cell CA, s/p left nephrectomy,
found to have AS in [**2171**]. He was followed by serial echos and
had increasing DOE with CHF. Hospitalized in [**4-26**] with [**Date Range **]
heart failure. Recommended for AVR so pt. could undergo newer
treatments for metastatic disease. Cath revealed 80% OM 1, 80%
OM 2, RCA 90%. Prior echo showed marked LVH, EF 60-65%, severe
AS, mild to moderate MR, mild TR, [**Doctor Last Name **]. Referred for AVR/CABG.

ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
[**2171**] - Mr. [**Known lastname 64996**] presented with hematuria and clot retention. A

CT scan revealed a 7 cm x 6 cm x 5 cm left renal clear cell
cancer with focal sarcomatoid features, grade III-IV with no
capsular perivascular, or renal vein invasion.
[**10/2176**]-CT scan revealed development of 1 cm left lung nodule in

the left lung pleural-based density at the costophrenic angle.
There was also a new 10 cm mass in the left adrenal gland.
[**5-/2177**] - developed a left parotid gland mass and increased
adrenal
mass as well as lung nodules. FNA of the left parotid mass was
nondiagnostic.
[**2177-10-27**] - underwent superficial parotidectomy and pathology
was
consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. He was
ineligible for the sorafenib/bevacizumab trial and for high-dose

IL-2 given his ventricular tachycardia in ETT.
[**1-/2178**] - Started off protocol sorafenib with PR. However, his
left
parotid mass demonstrated enlargement during the interval
between
[**2178-4-20**] and [**2178-6-20**] during which his remainder of systemic
disease got smaller.
[**7-/2178**] - 2400 cGy of radiation via CyberKnife over a 3-day
period
to the left parotid mass.
[**3-27**] - Sorafenib discontinued due to disease progression.
[**2179-4-27**] - Started on Perifosin protocol 06-408

sleep apnea with CPAP x 3 years


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use, but quit 35 yrs ago (smoked 2ppd for 20 yrs). There is no
history of alcohol abuse, but drinks occasionally, wine and
beer.

Family History:
Mother with MI at 55, father with MI at 40, died at 50 from MI.
Brother with CABG x 3 approximately 10 yrs ago.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify  I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related  complications. The TEE probe was
passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild  (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly  thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no  pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB: A prosthetic aortic valve is in place. Leaflets cannot
be
individually discerned. C.O. is 5.5, but a large residual
gradient (40) exists  across the valve. No [**Male First Name (un) **]. Aorta intact. MR
is 1+. Good biventricular systolic  fxn. Other
