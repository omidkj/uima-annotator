    40% right internal carotid artery stenosis and no
    stenosis on the left.
8.  Type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent.
9.  Reflux.
10. Chronic renal insufficiency with acute renal failure

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Debridement of ulcer in [**2142-8-3**];
percutaneous tracheostomy in [**2142-8-3**]; left carotid
endarterectomy in [**2137**]; right femoral-to-popliteal bypass
[**2142-11-22**]; appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include Anzemet, aspirin,
atorvastatin, Pepcid, insulin NPH 40 units q.a.m., regular 10
units in the evening and an insulin sliding scale regular
before meals and at bedtime, Lasix 40 mg b.i.d., levofloxacin
500 daily, Lipitor 40 mg daily, Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.,
Vicodin p.r.n., quinine 324 mg daily.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL APPEARANCE: This is a white
female in no acute distress. She is oriented x 3. HEENT:
Exam shows a well-healed tracheostomy scar and a well-healed
carotid endarterectomy incision. HEART:  Regular rate and
rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. ABDOMINAL EXAM: Is
unremarkable. NEUROLOGICAL EXAM: There was facial mouth droop
on the right side with left-sided weakness, [**6-7**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area on [**2142-11-22**]. She underwent
a right common femoral artery to above-knee popliteal bypass
with nonreversed right greater saphenous vein, angioscopy
valve lysis and debridement of the right lower extremity
ulcerations. She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the PACU in stable condition. The patient had
an episode of brief hypotension during magnesium infusion
which resolved. Postoperative hematocrit was 33.4, BUN 5,
creatinine 0.7. A chest x-ray was without pneumothorax. Line
was in the FCC. There were no infiltrates. Physical exam
shows monophasic DP and biphasic PT dopplerable signals on
the right foot. The incisions were clean, dry and intact.
Patient was continued on perioperative antibiotics. She
continued to do well and was transferred to the VICU for
continued monitoring and care.

On postoperative day 1, she had a T-max of 100.4 to 99.2. She
was continued on vancomycin, levofloxacin and Flagyl. Her
exam was remarkable for JP drain with serosanguineous
drainage and a biphasic DP and PT. The patient's fluids were
hep-locked. She was restarted on her home medications.
Ambulation to chair was instituted. Her antibiotics were
continued. Patient had some biceps weakness. Neurology did
come by and see the patient. They felt that the
manifestations of the weakness were consistent with a C5-C6
injury, likely upper brachial plexus from positioning in
surgery which would improve over time.

On postoperative day 2, patient's T-max was 98.9. Incisions
were clean, dry and intact. Her heel ulcers were dressed with
normal saline wet-to-dry dressings. She had a dopplerable DP
on the right. The JP drain and Foley were discontinued. She
remained in the VICU.

On postoperative day 3, patient remained afebrile.
Antibiotics were continued. Patient had an episode of nausea
which resolved. Patient failed a voiding trial. Her Foley was
required to be re-placed. Bladder scan showed 234 cc in the
bladder. Reglan was started for the nausea with improvement
in her symptoms.

On [**2142-11-26**] - postoperative day 4 - patient had a vac
placed on her right lower extremity wounds. Physical therapy
saw the patient; she felt patient would require rehab upon
discharge for optimizing her functional capacity. Patient's
hematocrit was 27.6, requiring a transfusion of a unit of
packed red blood cells with a post transfusion hematocrit of
32.8.

Patient had graft surveillance done on [**2142-11-27**] which
showed was not able to visualize the graft through the
staples. Patient began ambulating on [**11-28**].

On [**11-29**] the patient had a repeat study of her graft,
and patent graft was noted without any stenosis. The patient
underwent on [**2142-11-29**] a excisional debridement of her
right leg ulcers and heel gangrene with vac dressing
placement. She tolerated the procedure well and returned to
the regular nursing floor for continued care. The patient
continued on vancomycin and levofloxacin, and determination
will be made regarding ultimate antibiotic treatment and
length of therapy at the time of discharge. An Addendum to
antibiotics will be dictated at discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metoprolol 25 mg b.i.d., Lasix 40 mg
b.i.d., calcium carbonate 500 mg b.i.d., magnesium oxide 400
mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, quinine sulfate 325-mg
capsule at bedtime, Vicodin 5/500-mg tablets 1 to 2 q.4.h. as
needed, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., pentamidine 20 mg b.i.d., NPH
insulin (U-100) 40 units q.a.m., insulin regular Humulin (U-
100) 10 units at dinner, regular insulin Humulin sliding
scale before meals and at bedtime.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Right lower extremity ulcerations secondary to arterial
    insufficiency; status post right femoral/above-knee
    popliteal with nonreversed saphenous vein graft and wound
    debridement on [**2142-11-22**]; status post right leg
    wound debridement with Hemovac dressing placement on
    [**2142-11-29**].
2.  History of type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent;
    controlled.
3.  History of hyperlipidemia; on statin.
4.  History of coronary artery disease with myocardial
    infarction in [**2141-4-3**]; status post angioplasty with
    stenting of the left anterior descending; stable.
5.  History of cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction and
    history of congestive heart failure; compensated in [**Month (only) 205**]
    [**2142**].
6.  History of respiratory failure with tracheostomy
    placement and removal in [**2142-8-3**].
7.  History of carotid disease; less than 40% on the right
    and a patent left.
8.  History of a cerebrovascular accident in [**2139-10-4**];
    status post left carotid endarterectomy at that time.
9.  History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.
10. History of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
    with sepsis.
11. History of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.
12. Postoperative blood loss anemia, transfused; corrected.
13. A brachial plexus injury secondary to positioning in the
    operating room; stable.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient should have Hemovac dressing
changed every 3 days. Antibiotic therapy should be continued
until seen in followup. Patient should call for an
appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 1 to 2 weeks' time.
