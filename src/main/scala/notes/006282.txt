Chief Complaint:
found slumped over

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
intubation

History of Present Illness:
81F resident of [**Hospital3 **], with history of CAD, COPD,
diabetes mellitus type 2, Breast Cancer, pulmonary embolism 6
months ago, who was sent here from rehab on [**3-24**] after being
found hypoxic (O2 sat 70%), tachypneic, and cyanotic. She was
intubated in the ED, and found to have ST elevations in V3-V4,
as well as positive Trop of 0.49, CK 218. Cath revealed decrease
ejection fraction at ~25% and diffuse hypokinesis consistent
with "critical illness cardiomyopathy," with distal anterior,
apical and distal inferior akinesis, but clean coronaries;
hemodynamics revealed elevated filling pressures with near
equalization of diastolic pressures (RV 32/13/15; PA 35/25/28;
PCWP 13 mean; LV 110/17/31) C.O. 5.64 CI 3.33. This cardiac
morphology was consistent with Takatsubo's cardiomyopathy, and
is new compared to Echo she had 1 year ago when she was also
admitted for COPD exacerbation.

Pertinent Results:
Echo: Ejection Fraction:  25% to 30%, mid to distal septal,
anterior and apical akinesis. No left ventricular thrombus seen
(cannot exclude). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.

Cath: 1. LMCA had mild disease. The LAD had serial 30% stenoses.
The LCX had mild disease. The RCA had proximal 30% stenosis.
2. Left ventriculography demonstrated global hypokinesis with
akinesis
of the distal anterior, apex, and distal inferior walls.
ejection fraction 30%. 3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated
elevated right sided filling pressures with mRA pressure of 18
mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were markedly elevated
with mPCWP of 25 mmHg and LVEDP of 31 mmHg. There was no
significant pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 32 mmHg. The
cardiac output and cardiac index were preserved at 5.6 L/min and
3.3 L/min/M2, respectively. There was no gradient across the
aortic valve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 953**] is an 81 year old woman with an ejection fraction of
25%, whose catheterization showed minimal disease. She had no
intervention done in the cath lab for her Takatsubo type
cardiomyopathy.

Ms. [**Known lastname 953**] initially appeared overloaded and was diuresed on
day 1 of her intubation. This resulted in low pressures post
diuresis of 900 cc, so the patient was then repleted with normal
saline and started on pressors. Once she received a unit of
blood, her pressor requirement diminished. She remained in
normal sinus rhythm.

From the pulmonary standpoint, the patient was intubated for
respiratory arrest. She was treated for a COPD flare and treated
with IV steroids, nebulilzers, and levofloxacin, aztreonam, and
vancomycin for possible exacerbation. Her chest x ray appeared
clear but showed large volumes-c/w emphysematous changes. She
was extubated and briefly required bipap. Thereafter, she did
well on nasal cannula.

For her DM II, Ms. [**Known lastname 953**] was controlled with fingersticks and
an insulin drip. She was then transitioned to a sliding scale.

Ms. [**Known lastname 953**] had a hematocrit drop from 36 to 23 on [**3-25**]
periprocedurally. She was transfused 2 units PRBC. Her blood
loss was thought to be secondary to an RP bleed, but she did
have coffee grounds in her emesis and OB positive blood in her
stool. She was started on a PPI [**Hospital1 **] and a gastroenterology
consult was called. As she was unstable, no intervention was
made, however, it was thought that her small GI blood losses
should be followed up as an outpatient.
Ms. [**Known lastname 953**] initially required tube feeds when she was intubated
and afterwards as well as she failed her speech and swallow
evaluation and was at risk for aspiration. She also briefly
developed hypernatremia which was controlled with free water
boluses.

She was admitted to the CCU, where she was initially
aggressively diuresed with dopamine. She became hypotensive and
was place on levophed, with eventual restoration of blood
pressure to the point of becoming hypertensive and was started
on anti-HTN medication. Course was complicated by decrease in
Hct (34 ->23), with guaiac positive stools and negative NG
lavage. Hct stabilized and pt was continued on PPI. Pt was
weaned off of the ventilator, and continued on nebs, steroids,
and 7 day course of levo/vanc, and BIPAP. She was also noted to
have thrombocytopenia, but was HIT ab negative. She failed a
Speech and swallow study, and had a FEES (flexible endoscopic
examination of swallowing) study [**3-31**], which showed
moderate-severe pharyngeal dysphagia with difficulty clearing
secretions, poor airway closure, and weakened bolus propulsion,
all putting her at risk for aspiration. Per S&S, she should
remain NPO with NGT TFs for nutrition, pending repeat evaluation
in [**3-13**] days.  On [**4-1**] being transfer from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] to MED for
further management of dysphagia/COPD exacerbation.

On the medicine service, she was continued on all her cardiac
medications which included aspirin, metoprolol and lisinopril.
She was also started on low dose lasix given her low ejection
fraction. She should have a repeat echocardiogram in 4 weeks as
outpatient to evaluate for any improvement in cardiac function.
Her coumadin was held for high INR, thought to be from
nutritional deficiency. SHe would have her INR followed up in
rehab and coumadin restarted when INR<2.Her goal INR is between
[**2-11**] for PE and also atrial fibrillation. SHe was also started on
prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation. Her respiratory status
remained stable throughout her hospital stay. She also completed
10 days course of levofloxacin and vancomycin. She was also
continued on albuterol standing and switched from ipratropium to
tiotropium. Her hematocrit stabilzed on the floor and she was
guiac negative even when her INR was high. Her blood glucose was
closely watched and her insulin sliding scale tightened while
she was on steroid.

SHe initially failed speech and  swallow study secondary to
edema post intubation. She was thus placed on tubefeeds for
awhile with promote with fiber. She eventually passed the
swallow study and was put on pureed diet prior to discharge.
