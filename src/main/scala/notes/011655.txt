[**2143-9-12**] Right heart cathterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left heart
filling
pressures with RVEDP 21 mmHg and PCWP (mean) 25 mmHg.  The
cardiac index
was depressed at 1.64 l/min/m2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Elevated right and left heart filling pressures.
2. Depressed cardiac index.


Brief Hospital Course:
65M with ischemic cardiomyopathy (chronic systolic CHF, EF 15%),
cardiac cirrhosis, s/p CABG [**2115**] & [**2127**], [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular ICD, s/p
VT ablation, h/o CVA, s/p right CEA presents with volume
overload with planned right heart cath and milrinone initiation.

# Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure of Ischemic Etiology:
Ischemic cardiomyopathy (chronic systolic CHF, EF 15%), fluid
overloaded on exam. He was admitted for aggressive diuresis with
lasix gtt and metolazone. Milrinone gtt initiated after right
heart catheterization on [**2143-9-12**]. The patient was transferred to
the CCU for invasive hemodynamic monitoring to trial and titrate
Milrinone. After starting IV Milrinone, the patient's
hemodynamics improved markedly, with CI improving from 1.6 to
2.3 l/min/m2; on Milrinone 0.25 mcg/kg/hr, CI was 2.3 l/min/m2,
on 0.5 mcg/kg/hr, CI was 2 l/min/m2. Concomitant with the
Milrinone trial, the patient was volume optimized with
aggressive diuresed on Metolazone, a Lasix GTT, and Eplerenone;
the patient was transitioned from carvedilol to metoprolol while
being diuresed to help maintain mean arterial pressures and he
was eventually transitioned to PO Torsemide from Lasix. Preload
was also optimized with reprogramming of the patient's BV-Pacer
to lengthen the PR interval; after this was done, CI was 2.9
l/min/m2. No changes were made to the patient's antiarrhtymic
medications dofetilide and quinine.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable throughout admission without requiring
pressure support. Discharged on Metolozone, Torsemide,
Metoprolol Succinate, Eplerenone, Dofetilide, and Milrinone as
detailed below. Coumadin was held upon discharge due to INR 3.7,
with plans for the patient follow-up as detailed below.
.
# History of AF: Remained stably paced w/[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular ICD, s/p
VT ablation, anticoagulated on coumadin. Continued dofetilide
and quinine.
.
#  Congestive cirrhosis: Followed by hepatology; continue
regimen of rifaxamin, lactulose (dosed for [**2-7**] BM daily) to
improve encephalopathy.
.
#  Renal insufficiency: Secondary to poor cardiac output,
continued to monitor, renally dose medications.
.
#  Gout: Well controlled. Patient was continued on renally dosed
allopurinol, prednisone.
.
#  Hypothyroidism: Last TSH 13, FT4 1.1 ([**1-7**]). Continued
levothyroxine.
