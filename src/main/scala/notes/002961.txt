Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severe regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
(1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Prebypass

1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia
of the apex, anterior wall, anteroseptal, septal and
anterolateral walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %).

3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.

5.The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2).
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.

7.Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2157-5-27**]
at 1000am.

Post bypass

1. Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine, milrinone and epinephrine.

2. Biventricular systolic function is unchanged.

3. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets
move well and the valve appears well seated.

4. Peak gradient across the aortic valve is 15 mm Hg.

5. Trace mitral regurgitation.

6. Aorta is intact post decannulation.

7. However just before leaving the room an echo dense mass about
2 cm in size seen in the ascending aorta about 3 cm above the
aortic valve. Images reviewed by Drs [**First Name (STitle) 6507**], [**Name5 (PTitle) 168**] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **]. Mostly likely an artifact. No action to be taken at
this time. No evidence of aortic dissection.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Was admitted same day and went to operating room and underwent
cardiac intervention and aortic valve replacement.  See
operative reports for further details.  He was transferred to
the intensive care unit for hemodynamic monitoring.  In the
first twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
Episodes of atrial fibrillation was treated with betablockers
and amiodarone, he converted back to normal sinus rhythm.  He
was weaned from nitroglycerin and milirone on post operative day
one. On post operative day two he was transfered to the floor
for the remainder of his care.  Physical therapy worked with him
on strength and mobility.  He continued to have episodes of
atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone and betablockers, last
episode of [**5-30**].  Due to thrombocytopenia he was checked for
HITT which was negative and platelet count improving.  He was
started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation, carvediolol and
lisinopril for heart failure.  He was ready for discharge home
with services post o
