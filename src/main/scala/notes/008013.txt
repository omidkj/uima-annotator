History of Present Illness:
49 year old male with CLL dx [**2137**], followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], s/p
matched sibling donor allo-[**First Name (STitle) 3242**] in [**2-16**], and h/o HTN, CM with EF
20% (Echo in [**8-20**] with EF 50-55% and in [**9-19**] with EF 20-25%).
The patient was recently admitted from [**2142-11-28**] to [**2142-12-26**] for
resistant HSV c/b CHF exacerbation and aspergillus/enterobacter
on BAL. Pt was also recently discharged on [**2142-12-30**] after
presenting with nausea, chills, tachypnea, hypoxia, and
tachycardia after being given platelet transfusion and IVIG,
thought to be CHF exacerbation (improved with diuresis). He was
admitted again on [**12-5**] for shortness of breath due to
likely early signs of tamponade and had a pericardial drain
placed (removed after 1 day with no signs of reaccumulation). Pt
now presents with c/o fever and increased O2 requirement.  Much
of the history was obtained from the pts wife. 3 days PTA, the
pts wife noted that the pt suddenly turned pale and his sats
were 78% on RA, HR 130s.  After he layed down, his sats returned
to the 90s with HR in 120s.  The pt started to use home O2
(delivered to his house) 3days PTA and was satting at 97% on 2L.
 2 days PTA the pts wife again noted the pt turned pale and was
satting at 93% while watching TV.  She placed him back on O2.
One day PTA the pt became increasingly SOB, even at rest and was
seen in clinic.  He was told that his CXR appeared improved from
prior.  Blood cultures were drawn on [**1-21**] now with 1/2 bottles +
for staph aureus.  The pt has had low grade temps of 99.2/99.7
over the past several days.  On ROS, both the pt and his wife
note increasing fatigue since his last discharge.  He has had a
3 lb weight loss over the past several days, a persistent [**Month/Day (4) **]
(at times productive of light colored sputum) for several weeks,
continued chronic diarrhea.  The pt also c/o pleuritic CP with
inspiration on the R side of his chest which started again
today, but he had noted during his last admission.  Per the pts
wife, the pt also has increased leg pain and weakness which has
progressed to the point that the pt is unable to stand.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have a temp of 100.5, HR 140s-150s,
ANC 256. The pt was given Cefepime and Vancomycin, 1L fluids.
Lactate was 1.5.  CXR revealed a R pleural effusion increased in
size from prior.  CTA showed no PE, however did show BL patchy
and nodular opacities c/w an infectious process as well as a
large R pleural effusion  TTE showed a small pericardial
effusion (no tamponade)new from [**1-10**].  The pts R PICC line
was d'c/d given + blood cx for coag +staph aureus from [**1-21**]. VBG:
7.43/48/39.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
CLL, diagnosed in [**2137**] when incidentally noted to have elevated
WBC count. Treated with fludarabine then relapsed and required
four cycles of PCR and then again had five cycles of PCR, but
had persistent disease. He underwent reduced intensity allo-[**Year (4 digits) 3242**]
from his brother in [**2-16**] that was relatively uncomplicated,
though he did have grade I skin and hepatic GVHD, and febrile
neutropenia. In [**7-19**] his CLL relapsed and he underwent DLI in
[**9-18**] and [**10-19**]. in [**7-20**] his WBC rose and he developed
lyphadenopathy. It was decided to start campath (last dose
[**2142-10-16**] with total of `4 doses). He received 1 dose of
rituxan [**2142-12-8**] in lieu of campath.  He has suffered from oral
HSV lesions, and has been on famvir and valacyclovir. Pt has now
been receiving IVIG.
.
Recent Admissions as per HPI:
The patient was recently admitted from [**2142-11-28**] to [**2142-12-26**] for
resistant HSV c/b CHF exacerbation and aspergillus/enterobacter
on BAL. During that admission he was started on captopril and
BB.  Pt was also recently discharged on [**2142-12-30**] after presenting
with nausea, chills, tachypnea, hypoxia, and tachycardia after
being given platelet transfusion and IVIG, thought to be CHF
exacerbation (improved with diuresis). He was admitted again on
[**12-5**] for shortness of breath due to likely early signs of
tamponade and had a pericardial drain placed (removed after 1
day with no signs of reaccumulation).

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-22**]:
PORTABLE CHEST: Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are
stable.
Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable. There has been interval
increase in size of the right pleural effusion. Basilar
atelectasis is again noted. A hazy left upper lobe opacity is
again noted. No evidence of pneumothorax.  The right IJ CVL seen
extending out into the right axillary vein. Osseous and soft
tissue structures are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Interval
increase in size of right pleural effusion. Right IJ CVL tip in
the right axillary vein.
.
TTE [**1-22**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction [**10-4**] percent). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Compared with the findings
of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-1-9**], a very
small posterolateral pericardial effusion is now present (no
tamponade).
.
CTA [**1-22**]:
PA are patent without filling defect. BL patchy and nodular
opacities c/w an infectious process.  Large R pleural effusion
and fluid along major and minor fissures.  Small L pleural
effusion.  Small  Loculated collection in anterior R chest wall
is decreased in size.
.
EKG: tachycardia with rate 140s, leftward axis, LVH, LV strain
evidenced by ST depression in V2, V4 and V5
