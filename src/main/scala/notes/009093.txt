IMPRESSION:

Increase in size of fluid collection noted immediately anterior
to the
sternum, now measuring 3.8 cm x 3.4 cm x 7.5 cm. Extensive
adjacent fat
stranding. Some of these changes may be postsurgical; however
supperimposed
infection cannot be excluded.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was transferred from [**Hospital1 1774**] on [**11-5**]. The  sternum was stable
on exam with a quarter sized eschar at the lower end, without
surrounding cellulitis.  There was 2+ lower extremety edema with
cellulitis.  [**Month/Year (2) **] cultures were drawn and the sets from the
16th and 17th grew Staph aureus.  Vancomycin and Clindamicin
were started and her white count fell.  She was rehydrated as
her creatinine rose to 2 after diuresis and sepsis and
coagulopathy corrected with fresh frozen plasma and Vitamen K
for an INR of 10.  Infectious disease saw the patient.

On [**11-8**] the eschar was excised and the wound was solid, without
tracking. The wound was packed, wet to dry.  Cultures grew coag
negative staph.  The cellulitis of the lower extremeties
improved quickly and her creatinine improved.

A PICC was placed for a 4 week course of Vancomycin and the
Clindamicin stopped.  Local wound care to the sternum was
continued. CT scan done and she was taken to the OR for sternal
wound debridement on [**11-14**]. Cultures from the operating room
grew rare growth of coag + staph aureus.  Transferred to the
CVICU after extubation in the OR.  A wound VAC was left in place
and pain was controlled with Dilaudid, Oxycontin and Tramadol.
She was resumed on a heparin drip and coumadin was held for a
future flap surgery with plastics.  She was continued on
vancomycin with adjustments in doses based on trough levels.

On [**2108-11-21**] she was taken to the operating room with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] for removal of Talon plating, sternal
debridement and plating with pec flap advancement.
Please refer to operative note for details. Post operatively she
remained intubated and was admitted to the ICU. She was weaaned
and extubated without any difficulty. She was maintained on IV
vancomycin for MRSA with consultation and management by
infectious disease . Her pain was managed with oxycodone SR and
dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Her lopressor was titrated to
control her heart rate and was agressively diuresed. She was
discharged to home on 80mg lasix [**Hospital1 **]- home dose 120mg [**Hospital1 **]- dose
change discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3649**]. Coumadin dosing and follow up
confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3649**].
