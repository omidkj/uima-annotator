Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a 72 yr old female with hx of CAD s/p CABG,
colon cancer s/p hemicolectomy, AVR, h/o UGIB who presents to
OSH ([**Hospital6 10353**]) complaining of 2 days of nausea and
multiple episodes of vomiting coffee grounds. She has also noted
darker stools than normal. In ED, she received 2U PRBCs and her
hct trended from 38.3-->33-->28.5. On arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt's BP was
initially in the 110s but over the next several hours, dropped
to the 70s. She then received 2U FFP (for INR 2.0) and 3.5L of
crystalloid. She then became hypoxic and was found to have rales
on exam so she was given 40iv lasix and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
At [**Hospital1 18**], pt's initially hr 105, sbp 83/35, rr 44, 97%o2;
Initial hct 20.8, inr 2.1. Was suctioned via NGT w/ 40cc of
coffee ground emesis and then lavaged 1L w/ near-clearing.
Received 3u prbcs, 2u ffp, and 4l on ns -> hr 100s, sbp 90-100s,
hct 35. With ongoing resuscitation, the pt developed progressive
respiratory distress and hypoxia and was intubated for abg of
7.16/56/82 on nrb. Following intubation and sedation (propofol),
pt became hypotensive to sbp 70s and was started on
norepinephrine.

ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. There are complex (>4mm
and/or mobile) atheroma in the aortic root. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present and appears well-seated. The
prosthetic aortic leaflets appear normal. The transaortic
gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**2-17**]: Abdominal X ray
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a weighted feeding tube with
tip at the third portion of the duodenum.

[**2112-2-19**]
Abdominal Ultrasound:
FINDINGS: Transabdominal ultrasound examination of the right
upper quadrant was performed. The gallbladder is distended and
contains sludge. There is gallbladder wall edema. There are no
gallstones. Ascites is present. There is no intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilatation. The common duct is not dilated. Limited
evaluation of the liver demonstrates no focal lesions. There is
hepatopetal flow in the main portal vein.

IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder filled with sludge
demonstrating gallbladder wall edema. Note is made of ascites.
In the proper clinical context, these findings may be consistent
with acalculous cholecystitis. These findings are also
consistent with prolonged fasting state and third spacing into
the gallbladder wall. Clinical correlation and correlation with
laboratory values is recommended. If there is continued concern
for cholecystitis, evaluation with a HIDA scan with CCK may be
considered.
*
[**2112-2-25**] Abdominal Ultrasound:
TECHNIQUE: Limited right upper quadrant ultrasound.

FINDINGS: The examination is markedly limited due to body
habitus. There is a large amount of intra-abdominal ascites. The
gallbladder is nondistended and contains no stones. The
gallbladder wall is nonthickened. The portal vein is patent with
flow in the proper direction. The common bile duct measures 4
mm.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation or
cholecystitis. Ascites.

Repeat Echo
Echo [**2112-2-26**]
:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular systolic function
is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mid-cavitary gradient is identified.
Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. There is abnormal
septal
motion/position. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The
aortic prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and
transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.
