Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
79 Chinese-speaking woman with PMH of HTN, tuberculosis about 50
years ago, hx of hemoptysis in [**2177**] and [**2178**], who presents with
1 day of hemoptysis.  Patient was in her usual state of good
health when she started coughing and brought up what she
estimates is 2 teaspoons of blood mixed with mucous.  She has
4-5 episodes of hemoptysis accompanied by a sensation of "itchy
throat" over ~ 6 hours and called her daughter who brought her
in to the [**Name (NI) **].
.
From Pulmonary note [**2179-2-12**]:
"Patient first presented with respiratory complaints in
the fall of [**2176**]. At the time she had a cough and an abnormal
chest x-ray. In [**2177-7-30**] a chest CT revealed multiple
small bilateral nodules some of which were calcified consistent
with old granulomatous infection and a prominent pulmonary
artery. She underwent PFTs which showed normal FEV1, total lung
capacity, and DLCO. A followup chest CT one year later in
[**2178-9-29**] revealed stable nodules but a segment of the
right upper lobe bronchus was dilated. Followup CT in [**Month (only) 956**]
of
[**2178**] revealed segmental right upper lobe occlusion, question
extrinsic compression from calcified lymph node versus
endobronchial lesion, bronchoscopy recommended."
.
The bronch was performed at [**Hospital1 18**] by DFK with normal airways, no
evidence of scarring or obstruction.
.
Patient currently denies chronic cough, fever, SOB, night
sweats, or wt loss.
.
In the ED, patient had a CXR which was clear and a CTA which was
negative for PE.  IP was consulted and asked that patient be
admitted to the MICU for bronchoscopy.

BRONCHOSCOPY:
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The airway was anesthetized with
aerosolized 1% lidocaine.  The patient was then given
conscious sedation with Versed 2 mg and Fantanyl 100 mg and
bronchoscope was passed orally into the trachea where there
was normal trachea.  Sharp carina.  Airways were patent in
the right upper lobe, right middle lobe and right lower lobe
to subsegments.  Airways were patent in the left upper lobe,
lingula and left lower lobe subsegments.

IMPRESSION:  Normal airways, no evidence of scarring or
obstruction.
.
[**3-3**]: CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolism.
2) No interval change in the segmental tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities in
the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe distal to the
calcified endobronchial lesion.
3) Multiple small pulmonary nodules, please see prior CT report
of [**2180-2-3**] for description and recommendations.
4) Calcified mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with chronic
granulomatous disease.
5) Stable aneurysm of the aortic arch.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79 Chinese-speaking woman with PMH of HTN, tuberculosis
about 50 years ago, who presents with 1 day of hemoptysis
.
# hemoptysis: Patient has had hemoptysis before in [**2177**] and
[**2178**], has been extensively worked up for TB.  Given that she is
otherwise healthy seems unlikely to be active TB.  We sent
sputum and gram stain was negative for acid-fast bacilli.  Given
the tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance adjacent to the stable lung nodule,
suspected that the hemoptysis is from bronchiolitis.  IP was
consulted and on bronch found fresh blood in the R posterior
upper segment which is likely from a bleeding bronchial artery.
Given the risk of infarction of the brain or spine with
embolization, IP opted to observe patient.  Patient had [**11-30**]
episodes of minimal hemoptysis after the bronch, with stable
HCT.  Patient was called out to the floor for further
observation.
- IP following: felt that BAL negative for AFB was enough to
rule out for TB. as long as hemoptysis slowed overnight which it
did,  she is stable for D/c home and follow up in pulmonary
clinic with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
- QD HCT stable.

Discharge Condition:
stable


Discharge Instructions:
Take your usual home medications.  We have not started or
stopped any medications.

You had a bronchoscopy to look at your airways.  It showed some
blood in your lung which is probably from a bronchial artery.
While it is possible to stop the bleeding by treating this
artery, there is some associated risk.  Your physicians have
decided that the risks from the procedure are currently higher
than the risk from your bleeding.  Be sure to return to the
emergency department immediately if you have any further
bleeding, or any other concerning symptoms.

Followup Instructions:
1. Follow up with your primary care doctor in [**11-30**] weeks.
