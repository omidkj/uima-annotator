Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Dilated ascending
aorta.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2133-4-29**],
the findings are similar.

ECG Study Date of [**2133-12-28**]  4:37:14 PM
Atrial fibrillation, mean ventricular rate 70. Right
bundle-branch block.
Inferior myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2133-12-23**] cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation.

ECG Study Date of [**2133-12-29**]  2:31:48 PM
Normal sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Prolonged A-V
conduction.
Inferior myocardial infarction which is old and marked notching
across the
precordium suggetes old anterior wall myocardial infarction as
well. Since the previous tracing of [**2133-12-29**] no significant
change.

ECG Study Date of [**2133-12-31**]  10:21:36 AM
Possible ectopic atrial rhythm at rate 59 with first degree A-V
block and
right bundle-branch block. Probable old inferior wall myocardial
infarction. Low voltage in the precordial leads. Compared to the
previous tracing  of [**2133-12-29**] the sinus or ectopic atrial rate
is slower.
