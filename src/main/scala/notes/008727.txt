chest pain

History of Present Illness:
72F PMH CAD (sp stent to Diag in [**2118**], stable angina, pt refuses

with activity, worse with reclining (endorses multiple pillows
at night). Pain occurs in center of chest, described as
"squeezing," does not radiate, associated with dyspnea, lasts a

Patient given: asa 325mg, pantoprazole 40mg, amlodipine 5mg,
levothyroxine 25mcg
Pt was admitted to ED observation for 2 sets of enzymes - both
of which were negative, and then had P-MIBI this morning. P-MIBI
showed 0.5-1.[**Street Address(2) 20505**] elevation was noted in leads V1, V2, and
AVR and 1 mm of horizontal/slightly downsloping ST segment
depression in the inferolateral leads and pt was taken to the
cath lab.

In the cath lab she was noted to have distal L main disease. She
was evaluated by CT surgery while in the cath lab in preparation
for CABG
.
On arrival to the floor patient is symptom free and without
current complaint.

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram: [**2129-9-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Aortic sclerosis without frank stenosis. Mild
anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral
regurgitation. Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

Lower extremity Duplex [**2129-9-22**]
Duplex was performed of bilateral lower extremity veins.
Greater
saphenous veins are patent from the groin to the ankle
bilaterally with
diameters as noted on the scanned worksheet.
IMPRESSION: Patent bilateral greater saphenous veins.

Carotid Duplex: [**2129-9-22**]
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On the right there is a small heterogeneous plaque in
the ICA. On the left there is a small heterogeneous plaque seen
in the ECA.
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 123/20, 96/18, 101/26,
 cm/sec. CCA  peak systolic velocity is 84 cm/sec. ECA peak
systolic velocity is 138 cm/sec. The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.4. These
findings are consistent with 40-59% stenosis.
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 83/21, 88/29, 105/28,  cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 88 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 123 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.1 . These findings are consistent with no
stenosis.
 Right antegrade  vertebral artery flow.
 Left antegrade vertebral artery flow.
Impression: Right ICA 40-59% stenosis.
            Left ICA no stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 F with history of CAD sp stent to Diag 1 in [**2118**] admitted for

significant left main disease, patient referred for coronary
artery by-pass grafting.

The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2129-9-23**] where
the patient underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x3:  Left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and
reverse saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal
artery and diagonal artery. Closure of patent foramen ovale.
