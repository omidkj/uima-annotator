Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
83M with hx progressive lung disease (seen at [**Hospital **] hospital
by pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **]) and acute worsening of dyspnea
starting 2 days ago. He reports just a dry cough, no fevers,
chills, no orthopnea, some slight LLE swelling, but no weight
gain. He denies any CP/pressure, diaphoresis, nausea. He has
about a 150 p-y history of smoking. At [**Location (un) **] he was noted to
have bilateral lower lobe opacities on CXR, and a possible LL
infiltrate. He was given ceftriaxone/azithro/and 10 mg IV lasix
for concern of possible CHF. He had no EKG changes, but he did
have an elevated Trop I at 0.88 and a BNP of 1,000. He was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 **] ED for further workup.
.
He had been in his usual state of health until about 4 weeks ago
when he became very short of breath, and was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital for hypoxia. While there he was noted to have positive
cardiac enzymes, and there was concern for ACS, however he was
told he was a poor catheterization candidate due to his poor
kidney function (Cr 1.7). He also had a chest CT which per his
family's report was concerning for possible emphysema or
intrinsic lung disease. He was sent home on home O2, about 4L
NC. He was seen in follow up by a pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who was
concerned about pulmonary fibrosis per his family. He apparently
has also had PFTs at [**Location (un) **] as well.
.
At [**Hospital1 **] ED he was in mod resp distress satting 92% on NRB, was
given an extra 40 mg IV lasix, with 400 cc uop, and his symptoms
are slightly improved. His CXR here again shows bilateral lower
lobe patchy infiltrates and some slight suggestion of CHF. Here
he has no EKG changes, Trop T 0.35.

CXR AP [**3-19**]:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Left effusion with related opacity, most likely atelectasis.
Pneumonia cannot be excluded however in the presence of
infectious symptoms.
3. Emphysema.

CT chest w/o contrast [**3-20**]:
1. Congestive heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions,
superimposed on severe emphysema. If clinically indicated,
reevaluation for interstitial lung disease may be performed
after treatment.
2. Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes, which may be reactive in
the setting of congestive heart failure.
3. Coronary artery atherosclerosis.
4. Cholelithiasis.

CXR AP [**3-21**]:
Mild pulmonary edema has improved substantially, small bilateral
pleural effusions remain. Emphysema is moderate to severe. Heart
size is top normal.

ECHO [**3-21**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include basal to mid
anteroseptal hypokinesis and basal to mid inferoseptal and
inferior hypokinesis/akinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83yo M with ?severe emphysema presented to OSH w/ acute CHF
likely due to cardiac ischemia.

1. hypoxemia: This was likely due to underlying intrinsic lung
disease, as well as development of decompensated CHF from recent
ischemia. CT chest w/o contrast also revealed CHF w/ bilateral
effusions and evidence of severe emphysema.  Planned to obtain
PFT reports from [**Location (un) **], but requested PFTs with lung volumes
and DLCO here as outpatient, as well.  He had positive MIBI at
OSH but deferred further intervention at that time due to CRI.
His oxygen saturation improved to 96% on 3L NC and was breathing
comfortably after diuresis. Urine and blood cultures were both
negative, and he had no evidence of pulmonary infection. At time
of discharge, he was breathing comfortably on room air, but
still required supplemental O2 for ambulation.

2. CHF: He had been transferred from [**Location (un) **] to our ICU with
elevated troponin - NSTEMI w/ flash pulmonary edema.  Acute
occurence of symptoms was c/w decompensated CHF, which improved
after nitro and lasix.  Given the recent change in his cardiac
issue, as well as a positive MIBI (per pt), requested cardiology
to consult on need for cath.  Our cardiology service recommended
optimizing his medical regimen - started daily and lasix,
switched from labetolol to metoprolol, and discontinued norvasc.
 He will follow up with his outpatient cardiologist and continue
his cardiac medications.

3. DM: He was continued on once daily NPH w/ good glucose
control.

4. renal insufficiency: This was thought to be due to DM.
Baseline is 1.8-1.9 per PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **] improved to 1.7 prior to
discharge. [**Last Name (un) **] was held on admission - pt was restarted on this
after a brief trial of ACEI.

5. htn: Average BP 123/50; norvasc and avapro held at admission.
 Recommended continuing on home regimen with the exception of
norvasc.

6. FEN: Pt was given DM/low Na diet.

7. PPX: He was given heparin sc and PPI for prophylaxis.

8. Code: Full
