Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
elevated billirubin found at clinic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP
Multiple Paracenteses
Cardiac Catheterization
Orthotopic Liver Transplant


History of Present Illness:
67 yo F with presenting from clinic complaining of 3 bloody
stools 5 days pta and 1 bloody stool on the day pta, went to
clinic today and was found to have elevated bilirubin from 11.9
on [**8-25**] to 22.8 on [**8-31**] so was admitted to evaluate for biliary
obstruction/cholangitis.  Pt has mild RUQ pain, but denies,
nausea, vommiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, and husband
has not noticed any change in mental status.
.
She was recently admitted on [**8-11**] for choledocholithiasis,
diagnosed by ultrasound in ED, underwent ERCP on [**8-11**], where
sphincterotomy was performed, stones were extracted and 10 F
Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed.  Afterwarks she
complained of persistant nausea and RUQ pain radiating to back.
She underwent paracentesis on [**8-15**] and 1800 cc of fluid was
removed.  Her total bilirubin rose from 5.3 at admission ([**8-11**]);
to 7.1 on [**8-17**].  She underwent repeat ERCP on [**8-18**] which
demonstrated purulent bile, sludge, and stones.  The stent was
exchanged for another 10F Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] stent and she was started
on
Zosyn.  Following the procedure, her symptoms of pain and nausea
abated, but her total bilirubin continued to rise and her
diarrhea, which had resolved, returned on [**8-20**]. Stool was
negative for C.diff x 2.  On [**8-24**], she underwent cardiac
catherization as part of her evaluation for liver
transplantation and was found to be 60% stenosed in her LAD and
70% stenosed in her LCX.  As these lesions may be clinically
insignificant, a nuclear stress test was recommended but has not
yet been performed.  By discharge her bilirubin had continued to
rise and was 11.9 on the day of discharge ([**8-25**]).  Hepatology
suggested that the cause was intrahepatic cholestasis secondary
to drugs and recommending stopping Zosyn, starting Actigall, and
obtaining an MRCP.  She was deemed stable for discharge, and
upon return to clinic this further elevated bilirubin was
discovered and pt was admitted for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Repeat ERCP was performed, which showed stones in the CBD, which
were removed and stent was replaced.  Pt was placed on peri-ercp
cipro.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7925**] continued to rise despite ERCP, so US and MRCP
were performed, neither of which showed stones, strictures, or
any other sign of obstrustion.  Therefore, persistent
bilirubinemia was attributed to underlying liver disease.
.
Pt had persistent ascites, and received paracentesis x4 during
admission.  Before the second para the pt was complaining of RUQ
tenderness, nausea, and vomiting and fluid showed culture
negative SBP, despite treatment with peri-ERCP cipro. Pt was
started on ceftriaxone and eventually switched to po cipro with
negative surveillence taps x 2 and resolution of symptoms.
.
While being teated for SBP the pt developed acute renal failure
and urine soudium < 10 indicating a diagnosis of hepatorenal
syndrome.  She was treated with albumin, midodrine, and
octreotide and creatine began to fall.
.
During this admission pt recieved Stress MIBI on [**2118-9-5**] as
routine pre-transplant cardiac screening since pt has hx of
angina with recent cath on [**2118-8-24**] showing the LAD had a
60%lesion at the first diagonal and the mid LCx had 70%
stenosis.  Stress MIBI was normal.  However, while on midodrine
therapy, which is known to cause vasospasm, pt complained of L
scapula pain radiating to L arm, EKG with ST elevation in avR
and ST depressions in II, V2-V6 and aVL.  Troponin T elevated to
0.13.  Diagnosed with NSTEMI. Repeat cardiac cath was again
negative for flow limiting disease, and NSTEMI was attributed to
mitodrine-induced coronary vasospasm.
.
Renal function declined precipitously and she shortly became
anuric and required hemodialysis for volume overload. A urine
culture was positive for VRE, and linezolid was started.
.
On [**9-22**], with a MELD of 44, Ms [**Known lastname 7086**] received an orthotopic
liver transplant. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Please see
operative report for details. Two [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains were placed, 1
behind the right lobe of the liver and the second
behind the hilum. A right groin temporary dialysis line was
placed for ultrafiltration during surgery. She received standard
immunosuppression per protocol.
On POD 1 an U/S was obtained showing: No diastolic flow seen
within the main hepatic artery and branches. There are low peak
systolic arterial branch velocities measured in the liver
parenchyma. The findings raise concern for hepatic artery
stenosis, particularly given the liver donor age and status.
-Patent portal and hepatic veins.
On POD 2 another U/S of the liver was obtained with findings c/w
further decrease in the main hepatic arterial flow, with no
demonstrable flow during diastole. The peak systolic main
hepatic arterial flow has decreased compared to prior study from
1 day previously. Again, no intrahepatic arterial flow is
identified.
On [**9-23**] an arteriogram was obtained at the celiac trunk
demonstrating tortuous
proximal hepatic artery with some irregularity suggestive of
web-like
narrowing.  Nonvisualization of the distal hepatic branches.
-Patent hepatic and portal veins.
She spent a total of 5 days in the ICU
She did no
