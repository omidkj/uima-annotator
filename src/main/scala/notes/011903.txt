Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2153-10-17**]. The
heart size is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are
unremarkable. There is mild perihilar haziness and bronchial
wall thickening which may represent fluid overload as well as
small left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is no
pneumothorax or focal lung consolidation.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2159-4-5**] 2:45 AM
FINDINGS: A 1.3 cm stone is again noted in the gallbladder neck.
Additional nondependent foci along the gallbladder wall are
consistent with small polyps or adherent stones. There is no
wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The common duct is not
dilated. Again seen is massive right hydronephrosis.
IMPRESSION: Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
[**2159-4-6**]- CT abdomen/pelvis- in discussion with radiologist,
evidence of acute cholecystitis, with stone in cystic duct, fat
stranding.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 76 year old male with a history of HTN, HL,
?prostate cancer who presents with nausea/vomiting,epigastric
pain->back believed to be consistent with pancreatitis.
.
#Acute pancreatitis-
The patient reports an equivocal history of alcohol use. His
mother had pancreatic cancer. The patient has only one
functional kidney with a Cr of 1.3. CT scan not performed on
admission as felt patient had greater risk than benefit at this
point to further assess the pancreas. Abdominal ultrasound shows
cholelithiasis without obstruction, cholecystitis. Continue to
monitor progression of pain, trended enzymes. cholelithiasis and
alcohol considered as likely etiology. Zofran for nausea,
morphine, then to oxycodone for pain. Patient had minimal
discomfort on admission. Fever to 102.4 and leukocytosis
worsening overnight day two of admission. CT abdomen/pelvis
ordered. Performed [**4-6**] night. [**4-7**] 7AM, CT with evidence of
acute cholecystitis. Abx initiated, unasyn. Pt with +[**Doctor Last Name **]
sign, very tender RUQ. Surgery contact[**Name (NI) **]. To OR for lap
cholecystectomy. Hydration as tolerated, given CHF.
.
Hypoxia- Desaturation post 3 liters fluid given in ED. JVP
elevated. Only sparse crackled. To 85% RA transiently. Stable on
2L NC. CXR with atelectasis at right base. Held on further
hydration. Considered PE. Compression given splinting. Pt was
moved out of the ICU after 3 days and his respiratory efforts
improved. On HD 7 the patient was able to maintain adequate
saturations of 97% on RA
.
# CHF, EF unknown. Evidence of hypoxia with crackles bilaterally
on exam after aggressive fluid hydration with NS at 200 cc/hr x
3 liters in ED. DC'd IVF for now  10 mg IV lasix given hypoxia
by nightfloat admitting resident. The patient had been sat'ing
100% on RA prior to receiving 3 liters of IVF in ED. Sats stable
at 95% 2L, CT abdomen with lung cuts to assess bases.
.
# Glutealregion hematoma- as per previous CT scan in 06. Patient
will likely need repeat MRI as outpatient as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4026**] to
reassess as still present.
.
# HTN - HCTZ re initiated.
.
# Hyperlipidemia- Continue Lipitor 10 mg PO QD.
.
#FEN - NPO, IVF - held given fluid overload and desaturation.
Repleted potassium.

PPX - Hep SQ TID, PPI
