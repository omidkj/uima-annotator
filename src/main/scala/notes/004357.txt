Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2118-4-18**], he underwent deceased donor renal transplant with 24
hours of cold ischemia. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was left in place. Please refer to operative note for
details.

Postop, he experienced hypotension during the case requiring neo
for bp support and PRBCs. He made a little urine in the OR then
became anuric after the OR. He was transferred to the SICU for
management. Pressor support was weaned off and he was extubated.
TTE was done to evaluate hypotension. EF was 55%. He was noted
to have mild LVH and mild pulmonary artery systolic HTN. He
required IV medication treatment for hyperkalemia. Urine output
slowly increased to 1 liter per day and creatinine ranged
between [**10-2**].

He experienced delayed graft function and required hemodialysis.
Renal duplex demonstrated appropriate vasculature, no hydro and
no perinephric fluid collections. [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain output was
serosanguinous with a lot of leaking around the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain
insertion site.

Diet was advanced and tolerated. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted to adjust
insulin given elevated glucoses from the steroids. Pain
medication was adjusted to oral Dilaudid. IR placed a left IJ
triple lumen for meds for poor access. Immunosuppression
consisted of ATG 150mg for a total of 4 doses given past
response to ATG and DGF. CellCept was well tolerated,
Solu-Medrol was tapered to prednisone 20mg daily and Prograf was
adjusted to 20mg [**Hospital1 **] as trough levels were slow to increase to
goal (6.8 on [**4-25**]). Nephrology followed him throughout his
stay.

ID and pharmacy renally dosed his ARVs.

The decision was made to send him home on dialysis to return on
Thursday [**4-28**] at noon for a 1pm renal transplant biopsy. He would
then stay overnight for observation and have HD on Friday [**4-29**].

PT was consulted and recommended PT at home. [**Location (un) 43512**] Area VNA
was arranged. He was ambulating with a walker at time of
discharge. Vital signs were stable. [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed and
site suture the day of discharge.
