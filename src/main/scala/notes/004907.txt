History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **]F with hx aspiration PNA, g-tube, dmenetia, who was
BIBEMS after being found in NH in resp distress, with sat 60s.
By report, pt had had high residuals from G-tube and a KUB
demonstrated an ileus. EMS placed pt on a NRB and sats increased
to 90%. Baseline A&O x 1. No hx abd surgeries.
On arrival in the ED, vitals signs: T 99.3, HR 114, BP 116/56,
RR 40, SaO2 95% on NRB. Labs notable for a WBC 51, Hct 34, PLT
966, lactate 4.7 -> 3.6, and a trop 0.32 (last value 0.06 on
last hospitalization). The pt was intubated fiberoptically by
Anesthesia given the degree of kyphoscoliosis. A L femoral CVL
was placed, and a total of 3 L NS was adminsistered, as well as
Vanc/Levaquin/Zosyn. A small amount of levophed was required. A
CT torso revealed multifocal PNA and a ? early or partial SBO.
Gen [**Doctor First Name **] was consulted for the CT scan finding, feel that this
is not true SBO, recommend venting the g-tube to gravity.

On arrival in MICU, pt is intubated, sedated.

ROS: Unable as pt is intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98899**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with past medical history of
dementia, atrial fibrillatin, sacral decubitus ulcer admitted
from nursing home due to respiratory distress due to aspiration
pneumonia and sepsis.

1)Aspiration pneumonia and sepsis: On admission she had
respiratory failure and sepsis most likely [**3-15**] aspiration
pneumonia given multifocal infiltrates on chest ct from [**2106-5-9**].
 She was initially treated for healthcare associated pneumonia
with vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin and she completed an
eight day course.  Her sputum ended up growing ESBL Ecoli so she
was started on meropenem and completed an eight day course.  She
was also diuresed with 5-10mg IV lasix and her ventillator
settings were weaned.  On [**2106-5-25**] she was successfully extubated
after passing a spontaneous breathing trial.  Of note her RSBI
was 110-120 for several days preceeding extubation.  She did
well post extubation without any complications.  Due to concern
for aspiration she was kept NPO throughout her hospitalization
and was given tube feeds for nutrition.  Given the near
certainty that oral feeding will result in recurrant aspiration
pneumonia and sepsis, she should be not be given anything by
mouth.  Following extubation she was discharged back to her
nursing facility.

2)Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:  stage IV, with frank purulence on
admission.  Initially concerning for possible cause of sepsis on
admission, given that one set of blood cultures from admission
were positive for GPC's.  This ended up growing coagulase
negative staph in one bottle only with all other blood cultures
throughout her admission negative, indicating that this was most
likely a contaminant.  She was seen by plastic surgery during
her admission who did one bedside debridement.  She was also
followed by the wound care consult service during her admission.
She had a KinAir mattress for pressure relief throughout her
hospitalization.  She had dressing changes daily with packing of
the large sacral decubitus with antimicrobial kerlex daily.  She
also has
