Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain
Septic Shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) **] with sphicterotomy and stent placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 84 year old male with a history of CAD s/p DCA
of the LAD/D1 bifurcation stenosis in 11/96 and s/p rotational
atherectomy and PTCA of the LAD and PTCA of D2 in 1/97, carotid
stenosis s/p L CEA [**3-27**], HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2, and atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin who presents with chest pain.
.
The patient was sitting watching TV on the evening PTA, and at
11 pm developed epigastric pain which he initially thought was
due to indigestion. The pain then migrated up to his substernal
chest, and was [**2109-4-25**] in intensity. He denies radiation to
arm/jaw, SOB, n/v, palpitations. He did report diaphoresis. He
has never had a pain like this before, even with his prior
cardiac catheterizations. He took NTG SL x2 without relief, and
then told his wife to call the ambulance.
.
He reports decreased exercise tolerance over the past 2 years.
He denies DOE and can walk >1 city block. He did report chills
at home but no fever. Denied cough, diarrhea, pain/burning on
urination, or recent hospitalizations.
.
In the ambulance, he received Nitrospray and ASA 324 mg with no
change in his chest pain. In the ED, temp 98.5, HR 85, bp
146/73, SaO2 100% on NRB. His HR was then up to 110-150 and bp
up to 180/118. He was given 2650 mL NS, Diltiazem 10 mg IV x2,
20 mg IV x1, 30 mg x1 and then started on a Diltiazem gtt at 5
mg. CEs: Trop T <0.01, CK 63. proBNP 1499. INR 4.2. He spiked a
temp to 103.4, and WBC 10.9 with 86% neutrophils. Lactate 2.5.
CXR showed possible left lower lobe opacity due to obscuration
of left hemidiaphragm, possible etiologies include atelectasis
and pneumonia. UA showed neg leuk, neg nitrite, 0-2 WBC, rare
bacteria. Blood cultures x2 were sent. He received Tylenol 1 gm
PO x1, Motrin 600 mg PO x1, and Levaquin 750 mg IV x1.
.
He still had 5/10 chest pain when he hit the floor. He reports
his chest pain ressolved at 7 am on the day of admission, but he
still has an uneasy filling in his stomach.


Past Medical History:
-CAD s/p DCA of the LAD/D1 bifurcation stenosis in 11/96 and s/p
rotational atherectomy and PTCA of the LAD and PTCA of D2 in
[**12/2095**]
-s/p left carotid endarterectomy with Dacron patch angioplasty
[**2105-4-6**] for 90% left ICA stenosis. Ultrasound [**3-29**] less than 40%
right ICA stenosis and no stenosis of the left ICA.
-Hypertension
-Hypercholesterolemia
-Diabetes mellitus, Type 2
-Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
-Chronic Renal Insufficiency
-Asthma
-Chronic Iron Deficiency Anemia
-Prostate cancer about 13 years ago, status post resection.
-Prior 4-unit GI bleed in [**5-25**] while on Coumadin with work-up
remarkable for antral polyps, Barrett's esophagus, C-scope with
colonic polyps (adenoma) and diverticulosis without bleeding,
and negative capsule endoscopy. Prior 7 units GIB in [**6-26**] likely
due to ulcerated stomach polyps (hyperplastic), colonoscopy
normal at that time
-Barrett's esophagus

Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2096-1-20**] anatomy as
follows:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography revealed single vessel disease in this
right dominant system. The LAD had diffuse restenosis with
maximum 80% stenoses in the proximal and mid vessel as well as a
70% at the ostium of D2; D1 was free of restenosis.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy and PTCA of the LAD and
PTCA of D2 (see PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy and PTCA of the LAD and
PTCA of D2 (see PTCA comments).
.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2095-11-10**] anatomy as
follows:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography revealed single vessel disease in this
right dominant system. The LMCA was without hemodynamically
significant stenosis. The LAD had an 80% stenosis involving the
takeoff of the first diagonal, where there was also an 80%
stenosis. There was a 50% stenosis in the distal LAD. The LCx
system had mild luminal
irregularities. The OM1 had a 40% stenosis at its origin. The
RCA proper was without hemodynmically significant stenosis. The
PDA had a 40% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamic profile revealed normal filling
pressures. The cardiac index/output were within normal limits,
as were the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances.
3. Left ventriculography revealed normal systolic function
without wall motion abnormality. The estimated ejection fraction
was 64%.
4. Successful DCA of the LAD/D1 bifurcation stenosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful DCA of the LAD/D1 bifurcation stenosis.


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of tobacco use
ever. He does have a history of heavy alcohol abuse, and he
formery drank 5 martinis/night and Grand Marnier, would drink
more on the weekends. He stopped drinking 5 years ago. Denies
illicit drug use. He is a former FBI [**Doctor Last Name 360**], and then owned a
security business. He lives in [**Location **] with his wife.



Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. His father had an MI at age 62, and his older
brother died last week at age [**Age over 90 **] from emphysema.
