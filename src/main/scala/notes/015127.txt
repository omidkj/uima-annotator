Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiogenic shock.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
76 yo female with hx of CAD s/p CABG and AVR, HTN,
hypothyroidism who was initially admitted to an OSH on [**2131-4-3**]
after recent TKR [**2131-3-12**] with multiple complications including
abdominal abscess with sepsis, CHF, and DVT now being
transferred for further management. Pt underwent TKR and was at
rehab when she developed diarrhea and was started on PO flagyl.
She had a persistently elevated WBC with worsening dehydration
and was referred to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**2131-4-3**] for further
evaluation. She developed worsening SOB and impaired mentation
with markedly elevated WBC so CT Abd was performed to eval the
degree of her colitis and revealed an abscess near her sigmoid
colon. She underwent CT guided placement of a pigtail catheter
for drainage on [**4-13**] and culture of the fluid grew E.Coli and
Klebsiella and she was treated with Zosyn along with PO
vancomycin and flagyl for resistant Cdiff colitis. SOB and
declining mental status progressed and she was transferred to
the CCU on [**4-16**] for cardiogenic and septic shock. She also
developed a left axillary DVT associated with a PICC and have
noted to have a mottled left foot with absent dp pulse. US of
the LE revealed popliteal stenosis and was started on a heparin
gtt. She was evaluated by interventional cardiology for her
severe heart failure and she was felt not to be a candidate for
cardiac catherization or IABP as this would not be a bridge to
further therapy. Her family wanted her evaluated at a tertiary
care center so she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

CXR [**2131-4-26**]: The patient is after median sternotomy and aortic
valve replacement. The heart size is normal. The ET tube tip is
4.3 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip terminates in the
stomach. The left internal jugular line tip is at the junction
of the brachiocephalic vein with SVC.
The right PICC line tip terminates in superior SVC.
Bilateral pleural effusions are demonstrated at least moderate
in size. Mild perihilar haziness is present which might be
attributed to pulmonary edema although the precise degree of the
congestive heart failure is difficult to appreciate in the
presence of layering bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 76 yo female with hx of CAD s/p CABG and AVR, HTN,
hypothyroidism who was initially admitted to an OSH for TKR with
multiple complications including abdominal abscess with sepsis,
CHF, and DVT now being transferred for further management.
.
On arrival she was assessed and noted to have cardiogenic shock
with 4+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] 25%. Additionally she had severe volume
overload from resuscitation and required pressor support with
neosynephrine to maintain her blood pressure. She had
respiratory failure due to her cardiogenic shock but was unable
ot be diuresed due to hypotension. She had multiple abdominal
abscesses on her CT scan from [**Hospital3 **] hospital. She had no
positive blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **] but had abdominal catheter
growing E.coli and Klebsiella. Additionally on arrival she was
noted to have a cold, pulseless left lower extremity. Given her
over-riding cardiogenic shock and inability to be off pressor
medication, she was not a candidate for surgical intevention,
and her additional problems it was determined that she would not
make a meaningful recovery. Her family decided to withdraw
ventilatory and blood pressure support and pursue comfort with
morphine and ativan. She expired 10 hours later.
