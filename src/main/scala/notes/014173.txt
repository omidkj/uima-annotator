CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old woman
with coronary artery disease, non-ST elevation myocardial
infarction in [**2126-11-17**] with left circumflex stent,
diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
on home oxygen, history of severe anxiety who presented to
the Emergency Room with dyspnea on exertion over the past one
to two weeks.  Per the patient's family she has not been
taking her Lasix for several weeks after a recent psychiatric
admission, discharge recommendations do not include this
medication.  Per family, the patient also has been suffering
from one week of cough, productive of sputum.  Her anxiety
has significantly worsened and she was then treated with
Xanax for her symptoms.  On the day of admission, in addition
to her progressive shortness of breath she also experienced
palpitations.  After the call to Emergency Medical
Technicians she was transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] with respiratory rate of 28 to 32, initially
94 to 97% on 3 liters of nasal cannula with a pulse of 130,
blood pressure 140/90.  Over the course of the evening in the
Emergency Room the patient saturations fell, requiring
nonrebreather and eventually bypass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease, status
post myocardial infarction in [**2126-11-17**] with PCI to the
left circumflex.  An ejection fraction by catheterization at
that time demonstrated 47%.  2.  Diabetes mellitus.  3.
Hypertension.  4.  Congestive heart failure.  5.  Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  6.  Cataract surgery.  7.
Anxiety.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Metoprolol, Glucotrol XL,
Lasix, Seroquel, Celexa, Remeron, Xanax q. 4 hours.

ALLERGIES:  Reglan causing dystonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient worked as a [**Doctor Last Name 19914**] until one
year prior.  She smokes one and a half packs per day.  She
has a history of alcohol use, no illicit drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heartrate 129, blood pressure 129/64,
respiratory rate 20, sating 97% on biPAP, 20/10, set of IMs
330.  Physical examination in general revealed somnolent
elderly woman, sedated on biPAP, not following commands.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, normocephalic, atraumatic,
pupils equal, round and reactive to light, biPAP in place.
Neck supple, distended external jugular.  Cardiovascular,
tachycardiac, distant S1 and S2.  Pulmonary, decreased
breathsounds at the bases with mild wheezes.  No crackles.
Abdomen, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, 3+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Pulses
not palpable.  Feet, cool and dry.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 8.2, differential 82
neutrophils, 11 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes, 1 eosinophil.
Hematocrit 37.8, platelets 270, sodium 139, potassium 4.0,
chloride 96, bicarbonate 31, BUN 14, creatinine 0.8, glucose
241, calcium 10.1, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 3.6.  Cardiac
enzymes, creatinine kinase 39, troponin less than 0.3 with
subsequent creatinine kinases and troponins all negative.
Coagulation screen, PT 14.6, INR 1.4, PTT 27.
Electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 130, left
atrial enlargement, minimal lateral flattening and ST
depressions when compared with electrocardiogram of [**2126-12-7**].  Chest x-ray, bilateral pleural effusions and upper
zone redistribution.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Ms [**Known lastname **] received Ativan, Lasix
greater than 1.5 liters diuresed, however, oxygenation
continued to deteriorate, requiring intubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular - Ms [**Known lastname **] was transferred
to the Cardiac Care Unit for further management of her
congestive heart failure exacerbation.  She underwent
placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter which demonstrated elevated
pulmonary artery diastolic pressures, approximately 60/35
with a wedge of 36 on admission.  She underwent diuresis of
greater than 7 liters during her hospitalization stay with
subsequent improvement in her hemodynamics as well as
pulmonary function.  She was maintained on Milrinone as well
as Neo-Synephrine for hemodynamic management during her
diuresis.  These medications were able to be weaned on [**2129-7-9**].  Her medical regimen at this time includes
Spironolactone and Lasix 80 mg p.o. q. day.  Plans include
the addition of Captopril, however, the patient has poorly
tolerated her recent trials of small dose Captopril with
subsequent hypotension.  Plans are for gentle fluid
equilibration and repeated trials of ACE inhibitor.

Ischemia, the patient ruled out for ischemia by cardiac
enzymes.  She was maintained on her outpatient regimen
including Aspirin and Lipitor.  Her beta blocker was held
given her acute congestive heart failure exacerbation, plan
to be restarted as an outpatient.

Rhythm, the patient maintained sinus rhythm throughout
hospitalization.  She did experience persistent tachycardia
which is felt likely secondary to hypotension, infection
which was felt likely secondary to a combination of initially
infection cardiomyopathy, anxiety, and subsequently
hypovolemia.

Infectious disease - The patient with significant sputum
production and history of productive cough as well as
temperature spikes.  Initial sputum sample is demonstrated,
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.  Initial
coverage included Vancomycin, Levofloxacin.  Her Vancomycin
was eventually narrowed to Oxacillin and subsequently
Dicloxacillin p.o. for Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
aureus pneumonia.  She will also continue a 14 day course of
Levofloxacin for a possible vent-associated pneumonia.

Pulmonary - With the treatment of her congestive heart
failure and pneumonia, the patient's pulmonary function
improved and she was able to be weaned and extubated on [**2129-7-6**].  She will continue to require pulmonary support
including nasal cannula oxygen.  She is currently at her home
level.  She will also require pulmonary toilet as well as
continuation of her inhalers for her chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

Neurological - Sedation, the patient required significant
levels of Benzodiazepines to achieve sedation, initially with
a Versed drip.  After extubation, she was able to be
transitioned to p.o. medications including initially Xanax
but transitioned to Klonopin on [**2129-7-9**].  The patient
has a history of significant anxiety and Benzodiazepine
dependence.  She was also continued on her Celexa and
Seroquel in-house and occasionally required Haldol prn for
agitation.  The patient will need a formal psychiatry
consultation for assistance in managing her anxiety disorder.

Prophylaxis - The patient was maintained on Lansoprazole and
pneuma boots for protection while hospitalized.

Access - The patient had a right internal jugular quarter
Swan-Ganz catheter placed on [**2129-7-1**].

This hospital course dictated for the dates through [**2129-7-9**].
