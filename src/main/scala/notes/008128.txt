Service:HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Unresectable metastatic colon cancer to
liver.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Previous coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary artery
disease (myocardial infarction times three).
2.  History of ventricular tachycardia with automatic
implantable cardiovascular defibrillator.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Partial colon resection.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
gentleman seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] previously for a lower anterior
resection of rectus sigmoid carcinoma on [**2176-6-28**].

Follow-up CT of the chest and abdomen on [**2180-2-21**],
showed a large area of heterogenous perfusion measuring 8.6
x 7.7 cm.  Upon subsequently admission to the hospital on
[**7-10**] for chest, abdominal and back pain, he received
another CT scan of the abdomen that displayed a poorly
defined area of heterogenous enhancement located within the
right lobe of the liver that increased in size compared to
the prior exam.

The lesion was deemed to be a metastatic spread of his
previous colon cancer, and he was planned for elective
surgery.  He was seen by Cardiology and Anesthesia prior to
surgery and was cleared.

He was admitted on [**2180-8-31**], for exploratory
laparotomy with possible excision of the right hepatic lobe.
The lesion was deemed unresectable at the time of surgery,
and the patient was closed.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.

Postoperatively he complained of some abdominal pain but did
quite well otherwise.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] and
seen by the Acute Pain Service Team.  He was continued on
epidural with Meperidine.  On [**9-1**], the epidural was
discontinued.

During his stay in the hospital, a right internal jugular
triple-lumen catheter was placed with no complications.  He
tolerated the procedure well, and his chest x-ray showed no
evidence of pneumothorax and showed good placement of the
catheter tip.

On [**9-1**], he was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit as he was found unresponsive, cyanotic and hypoxic.  He
was hemodynamically stable but intubated and ventilated.

Chest x-ray at the time showed right upper lobe and right
middle lobe infiltrates but no evidence of pneumothorax.  CT
of the chest ruled out the presence of a pulmonary emboli.
Head CT was normal.  The patient's troponins were negative as
well.

The patient was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis, and he
was diuresed gently with Lasix.  He was subsequently
extubated on [**2180-9-3**], and tolerated this procedure
well and remained hemodynamically stable.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 **].  On
exam the patient was well.  His temperature is 98.9??????, heart
rate 60, blood pressure 140/78, respirations 20, oxygen
saturation 94% on room air.  He was alert and oriented times
three.  He had clear lung fields.  There were normal heart
sounds.  His abdomen is soft and nontender and slightly
obese.  He has good peripheral pulses.  He has been eating a
regular diet and ambulating.  He is currently stable for
discharge.
