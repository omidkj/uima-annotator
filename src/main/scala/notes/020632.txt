History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma, known

Oncologic history: Metastatic Melanoma
PRIOR TREATMENT:
1. Resection of a left nasal primary melanoma in [**2091**].
2. Recurrence on the left mandible (biopsy-documented) in [**2114**].
3. Left radical lymph node dissection and partial thyroidectomy
in 08/[**2114**].
4. Thirteen cycles of GM-CSF per ECOG 4697.
5. [**Year (4 digits) 4338**] in [**12/2115**] revealed right frontal and left central sulcus
metastases with hemorrhage with question of leptomeningeal
disease. [**1-/2116**], underwent resection of the frontal lesion;
path c/w met melanoma. She subsequently underwent stereotactic
radiosurgery to the left central sulcus metastasis and the right
frontal surgical cavity. Recurrance of brain tumor in [**2119**].
6. [**2119-9-15**] had two new subcutaneous nodules in
the right lateral abdominal wall and the anterior lower chest
wall, progression of bilateral adrenal metastases, new lesion in
the anterolateral left kidney, and slight retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.
7. Initiation of treatment with off-study dacarbazine [**2120-2-23**]
because of fulminant disease progression at multiple sites.
Second cycle given [**2120-3-13**].
