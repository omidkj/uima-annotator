In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 1617**] is an 87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on
dofetalide and coumadin, sCHF (EF 40%), h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
CML on Gleevec but not taking, CKD (baseline Cr 1.6), who
initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting
on [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to
untreated CML. Of note, she had not been taking her Gleevec for
6 weeks because of side effects of malaise and GI discomfort.
Her hospital course was notable for starting Gleevec with more
GI symptoms which caused a decrease in her WBC count. They also
discontinued dofetilide due to worsening renal failure on [**2-12**].
On [**2-13**], she developed intractable V tach in the 130s with
pressures in the 90s/50s that was not easily amenable to pacer
override by EP. She was transferred to the CCU for further
management of her v tach.
In the CCU, she complains of mild dyspnea at rest, palpitations.
She denies CP or light-headedness. She was in sinus prior to
transfer, but en route returned into v tach in the 130s with
pressures in the 90s/50s. EP was called again who tried again to
override pace the v tach successfully. However, v tach recurred
and this needed to be repeated 2 more times. Amiodarone 100mg IV
ONCE bolus plus 1mg/min drip x 6 hours, then 0.5mg/min bolus x
18 hours was started. Electrolyte panel returned showing
hypokalemia of 3.2 and hypomagnesemia of 1.7. This was repleted
immediately with K 10mg IV ONCE, and K 40mg PO ONCE and
magnesium 4gm IV ONCE. Because the v tach developed at a sinus
rate of 78, the pacer was set to 85bpm to override the
ventricular ectopic focus with an automated 8 time override
mechanism.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies nause, vomitting, diarrhea,
constipation. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope (except on
presentation).

IMAGING/STUDIES:

NCHCT [**2117-2-5**]: There is no acute hemorrhage, large areas of
edema, large masses or mass effect. Periventricular white matter
hypodensities consistent with [**Month/Day/Year **] small vessel ischemic
changes. Additional hypodensities noted within the basal ganglia
bilaterally are likely due to old lacunar infarcts. There is
preservation of normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation.
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci is likely due to
age-related parenchymal atrophy. Visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid air cells are clear. Soft tissues of the orbits and
nasopharynx are within normal limits. Mild calcification of the
cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries is noted.
IMPRESSION: No a
