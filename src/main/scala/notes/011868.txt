[**2114-12-30**]: TTE
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (EF 35%). The distal
third to one half of the
left ventricle is akinetic.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
[**2114-12-31**]: CXR
Cardiomegaly with no evidence of failure. No evidence of
pneumonia.
.
[**2114-12-31**]: TTE
Conclusions:
1. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is
moderately depressed (EF 35%)
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5. There is a small to moderate sized, loculated (over RV)
pericardial
effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood,
inflammation or
other cellular elements.
.
[**2115-1-2**]: CXR
Again note is made of mild cardiomegaly. The mediastinal and
hilar contours are unchanged compared to the previous study.
Again note is made of increased pulmonary vasculature, as well
as increased interstitial markings, suggesting mild congestive
heart failure. No parenchymal consolidation is noted. Again note
is made of multiple staples in the right axilla.
.
[**2115-1-2**]: TTE
LV apical kinesis, no aneurysm seen
stable pericardial effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Transferred from OSH in the setting of chest pain,
hypertension and impressive ST elevations in leads V4-V6. Cath
however, failed to show culprit vessel.  Left main showed small
ulcer on superior roof without evidence of thrombus or luminal
compromise. LAD: mild luminal irregularities. LCX: 80% OM1
stenosis. RCA: diffuse disease proximally and 60% stenosis in
mid vessel. No evidence of flow reduction. No intervention
performed. Right heart cath was performed which did show
elevated filling pressures with RA 6, RV 49/10, PA 49/24 and
wedge of 27 w/ CI - 2.46. Pt was ultimately transferred to CCU
post cath chest pain free and started on nipride gtt for bp
control. Since there was no clear culprit vessel, it was decided
to medically manage pt and maintain good blood pressure control.
Enzymes trended down during hospital course. Repeat echo showed
moderate LV systolic dysfunction with EF 35-40% and
inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis and apical
akinesis/dyskinesis without evidence of apical aneurysm or
thrombus. Pt had several episodes of chest pain during admission
associated with shortness of breath which were relieved with
nitroglycerine and morphine. EKGs during these episodes showed
no changes. Pt continued to be medically managed on ASA, Plavix,
Lipitor 80. Pt was unable to tolerate a beta-blocker secondary
to wheezing and an ACE inhibitor was unable to be started in the
setting of her renal failure. Her hypertension was managed by
titrating up verapamil and isosorbide dinitrate.
.
2. CHF: Found w/ elevated filling pressures on right heart cath
w/ wedge of 27. Echo on [**12-31**] showed EF 35% but w/ E/A ratio of
0.6 and tr gradient of 30-36. Had moderate mr and trace TR.
Thought to have component of diastolic dysfunction. Diuresed w/
iv lasix 40 w/ moderate diuresis and started on beta blockade.
Given elevated creatinine, decided to hold [**Month/Year (2) **] and switched to
hydralizine and nitrates. However, pt continued to remain mildly
hypoxic and quite wheezy w/ CXR not showing florid failure.
Later, during hospital course, felt that shortness of breath,
more likely secondary to COPD/RAD flare and pt started on po
prednisone 60 qd.
.
2a: Pericardial effusion: echo w/ small to moderate pericardial
effusion, loculated and echo dense thought secondary to
inflammation. Recheck on [**12-31**] showed stable effusion and w/o
pulsus paradoxus on A-line. Will likely need f/u echo in future.
.
3. Rhythm: Stable throughout hospitalization
.
4. HTN: Found w/ elevated systolic BP's into the 200's in the
cath lab. Initially started on nipride gtt which was weaned off
by hospi
