History of Present Illness:
62M w/ hx of PE, COPD, hep C, AICD, and bronchiolitis obliterans
presents with increasing dyspnea x1 week. Pulmonary problems
began after he started new interferon tx for HCV in 11/[**2148**]. He
has had multiple effusions tapped w/ no malignancy, bx showed
bronchiolitis obliterans. Last set of PFTs revealed: Vital
capacity is 3.92 liters, 80% predicted; his FEV1 is 1.63 liters,
48% predicted, the vital capacity has increased from 64%
predicted; FEV1 is increased from 41% predicted.

He started home oxygen in [**2150-3-29**]. In the last week, he
has had increasing dyspnea at rest, chest pain when dyspneic,
and increasing orthopnea. Requires home O2 of 2L, has had
decreasing sats at home, reported to 82% on RA. He thinks he has
gained more weight. Increasing cough in past 24 hrs, mildly
productive, but has been taking mucinex.  No swelling in
extremities.

ROS: +DOE, orthopnea, subjective fever, pleuritic chest pain,
dry cough. Negative for PND, sick contacts, hemoptysis, chest
pain or recent travel.

STUDIES:
Admission ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with ventricular demand pacing

[**2150-7-26**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
2.  Possible mild pulmonary edema on background of emphysema.
3.  Slight increase in left basilar opacity may indicate a
superimposed
infectious process.

[**2150-7-28**] CT Chest:
1.  Since the recent CT scan from [**2150-7-13**], multiple lower
lobe pulmonary
nodules have slightly decreased in size with improvement in
ill-defined
subpleural and lower lobe opacities.  No new nodules or
opacities are
identified.
2.  Small left pleural effusion is essentially stable.
3.  Severe emphysema is unchanged.
4.  Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
5.  Nodularity of the liver, which may be consistent with
cirrhosis.
6.  Substantial pericardial calcifications and severe aortic
valve
calcifications.
7.  Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary
hypertension.

[**2150-7-28**] [**Month/Day/Year **]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 7 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen (after taking into consideration acoustic shadowing from
the severely calcified mitral annulus). The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In
the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.]
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2150-5-14**], the mitral regurgitation may be worse, but the
technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes
definitive comparison. The pressure gradient across the mitral
valve is increased.

Carotid US:
There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally.

Abdominal US:
1.  Coarse heterogeneous liver parenchyma consistent with
history of liver
fibrosis and HCV.  No evidence of focal liver mass.
2.  Normal
