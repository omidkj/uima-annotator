Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Status epilepticus, respiratory failure, pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical ventilation via ETT
Central venous line placement
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
20 year old male with PMHx MVC rollover with traumatic brain
injury in [**7-/2164**] complicated by increased ICPs (s/p
hemicraniectomy), PEG placement, VP shunt, DVT/PEs (s/p IVC
filter placement), pneumonia/bacteremia ([**1-/2165**]) with trach
placement, difficult to control seizures who presents with
status epilepticus in the setting of significant left sided
pneumonia, mucus plugging and lobar collapse.
.
The patient has been at [**Location (un) 7740**] Neuro Rehab and was in his
usual state of health until 9:55am when he was noted to be
deviating his head to the left with eye/facial and RUE
twitching. As this is his usual presentation for seizures, he
was given valium 5mg at 10:05am and another valium 5mg at
10:15am. His seizure persisted and the patient was found to be
hypoxic to 50-60% (tracheostomy not ventilated) vs. 88-90s and
EMS was called. The patient was also significantly tachycardic
(HR130s) with a low grade temperature (T100.5). The patient
received ambu-bagging en route to [**Hospital3 **] and received
valium 10mg IV before presentation to the ED without resolution
of his symptoms.
.
At [**Hospital3 **], the patient was initially tachycardic to
HR150s, O2 sat 89-90% on 10 L humidified air via trach and
continued to seize (right facial twitching, left deviated
conjugate gaze). He received Tylenol 650mg NG, Ativan 6mg,
Versed gtt with improvement but not resolution of symptoms (left
eye deviation resolved); thus, the patient was also started on
propofol gtt. Labs there were notable for a leukocytosis (WBC
13.6), and subtherapeutic phenytoin (11.3) and phenobarb (14.0).
Urine and blood cultures X2 were sent. CXR showed LUL pneumonia
and thus the patient also received nebs, zofran 4mg IV and
Cefepime 400mg /Cipro ?? dose/Vancomycin 1500mg around 1-1:30pm.
Copious thick secretions were reportedly suctioned out and
Respiratory Therapy placed the patient on mechanical
ventilation. Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for continuity of
care and further work-up of acute critical illness, the patient
received Decadron 10mg IV (unclear rationale), Fentanyl 100mg IV
and Vecuronium 8mg IV X3 for irregular respirations. The patient
also received 2.5L IVF.
.
En route to [**Hospital1 18**] via Med Flight, the patient was persistently
tachycardic although maintained his blood pressures (106/60). He
received Xopenex nebs, and O2 sats intermittently dropped to
70-85% on assist control with TV 550, RR16, PEEP 13, FiO2 100%.
Propofol was increased to 30mcg/kg/min.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: T100.0, HR143, RR35,
96% on aforementioned [**Hospital1 **] settings. At some point, Versed gtt
was discontinued and the patient was continued on propofol gtt
only. CXR showed complete white out of left hemithorax with air
bronchograms and concern for Auto-PEEP. ABG 7.33/45/53/25. His
[**Hospital1 **] setting were adjusted but second CXR still appeared
concerning. Ultimately, with decrease of PEEP to 5, decreased TV
380 and RR increased to ~24, the patient started satting more
stably in the 90s with ABG 7.39/37/247/23. The patient's labs
were notable for Lactate 4.2, leukocytosis to 15.6 with
bandemia, troponin T 0.06 and low dilantin (7.0, target 13-20)
and phenobarbital levels (10.5, target 20). Urinalysis was
negative for UTI. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. He received 1.5L
IVF volume resuscitation. Right femoral triple lumen CVL was
placed. Neurology was consulted and recommended dilantin 800mg
and phenobarb 800mg loading. The patient also received tylenol
650mg PR X2 and lorazepam 2mg X1. The patient underwent CT head,
CT chest, VP shunt studies which were reportedly
unconcerning/stable prior to transfer.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is sedated with propofol,
ventilated via tracheostomy and appears comfortable. RUE
tremors/ twitching no longer present. Mother at bedside,
intermittently tearful and angry regarding rehab care.
.
ROS: Patient ventilated, sedated - unable to assess. Per
patient's mother, increased coughing and decreased
interactiveness since Monday although there had been discussions
then regarding discontinuing trach.


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
[**6-23**] cxr
FINDINGS: There is near-complete opacification of the left
hemithorax with associated loss of volume and hyperinflation of
the right lung, compatible with complete left upper lobe
collapse and partial left lower lobe collapse.  The patient is
status post tracheostomy demonstrated within the mid trachea.
The hyperinflated right lung is clear with no focal
consolidations. There are no pleural effusions and no evidence
of pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
demonstrate leftward shift and are obscured by the left
hemithorax collapse.

IMPRESSION: Complete left upper lobe and near complete left
lower lobe
collapse with associated mediastinal shift and right lung
hyperinflation.

IMPRESSION: Increased conspicuity of high-attenuation material
layering along
the tentorium concerning for increased subdural hemorrhage.
