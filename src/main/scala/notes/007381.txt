Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2135-4-25**] Epicardial LV Lead Placement via Left Thoracotomy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old male with chronic ischemic post-infarction
cardiomyopathy who [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] an attempted upgrade to
biventricular ICD  by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2134-3-18**]. Initially, the
LV lead was implanted, but dislodged shortly thereafter. Despite
multiple attempts, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was unable to find a suitable
position for capturing of the left ventricle.  The implant was
therefore abandoned and he has been left with his DDD-ICD. He
denies receiving any defibrillator shocks, palpitations or
syncope.  His main symptoms are exertional shortness of breath
and fatigue.  Given history of technical difficulties, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] advised against another attempt at transvenous
placement, and recommended Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] perform epicardial left
ventricular lead placement via mini thoractomy.

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-4-25**] Intraop TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of all walls with inferior wall akinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= [**10-6**] %). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with focal hypokinesis of the mid to apical free wall.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2).
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Final Report
INDICATION: Status post left ventricular lead placement via left
mini
thoracotomy. Evaluate line placement. Assess for pneumothorax
and/or
effusion.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from [**2135-4-1**].

FINDINGS: The pacemaker/ICD is in a new position overlying the
left
hemithorax and there are new left ventricular epicardial leads
in addition to
unchanged right atrial and right ventricular leads. The ET tube
ends 5.2 cm
above the carina. The NG tube passes below the level of the
diaphragm and
ends in the high stomach. A linear appliance projects over the
left
hemithorax, extending from base to apex. Mild pulmonary edema is
exaggerated
by low lung volumes. There are no definite pleural effusions. No

pneumothorax is seen. Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. The
mediastinal
contours are normal. The patient is status post midline
sternotomy and CABG.
Surgical clips overlie the epigastrium.

IMPRESSION:

1. New position of left pacemaker/ICD with standard positions of
right
atrial, right ventricular, and left epicardial leads.

2. Mild pulmonary edema.

3. Low lung volumes.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13169**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] L mini thorocotomy and L lead placement
for biV ICD placement on [**2135-4-25**].  He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition.  His
potassium was elevated at 6.4 and he was treated with insulin.
He also had a metabolic acidosis which was treated with volume
and bicarb.  He was hemodynamically stable and was extubated.
He remained stable until 9:50 PM when he became hypotensive and
unresponsive.  He had runs of VT and was paced out of it with
his biV ICD.  The pt. went into PEA and he required CPR.  He was
also shocked 3 times.  He was fully lined so he could start on
CVVH and a CCO swan was placed.  He required a high dose of
Levophed and was started on Vasopressin.  The family was
notified and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was present for the code.  Renal and EP
were present and he was started on CVVH.  His device was
interrogated and it showed that he had had slow VT so he was
trying to pace out of it with the ICD, but his device never
fired.
He remained relatively stable but had very high filling
pressures.  He was started on Milrinone and then developed
ventricular ectopy.  At 2AM he went back into VT and was shocked
numerous times.  His cardiac output and SVO2 continued to drop.
The pt. was coded for 40 minutes and received multiple shocks.
He also received Digibond as his Dig leved was 3.1.  His family
was present and eventually he was in PEA and had a long run of
CPR.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who ran the first code and was present the
rest of the night, called the code at 2:40 AM.  The priest came
and met with the family.  The medical examiner declined the
case.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was aware.
