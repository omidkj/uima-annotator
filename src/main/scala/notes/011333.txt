Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, jaundice

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of central lines and hemodialysis line
intubation

History of Present Illness:
44 year old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis, lacunar infarcts
with residual right sided hemiparesis, and hemolytic anemia,
presenting from her first hepatology appointment with altered
mental status and multiple lab abnormalities. The patient lives
and receives her care in [**Location (un) 3844**]. She lives with her
husband who provided her recent history as the patient is unable
to do so. Her husband reports that she was herself (alert and
oriented times 3 but physcially only able to assist with
transfers) until approximately 1 week ago when they noticed that
she was more jaundiced than usual. They went to the patient's
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-9**] at which time labs demonstrated reported Hct ~24 and
normal baseline creatinine. Given complaint of right sided pain
realted to contractures, she was started on a fentanyl patch at
25mcgs. Shortly after starting the patch, her husband noted that
she was more sedated and, over the next 2 days, she became
profoundly sedated such that she was not able to take POs. Her
husband reported that he knew she had an appt at the liver
center today so waited to bring her in for the appt. When they
arrived to the liver center for the patient's 1st appt with Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 7033**], EMS was called and the patient was sent to the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, her vs were 96.0, 54, 108/75, 16, 88% RA
--> 97% on 5L. She was triggered for nursing concern as she was
minimally responsive. Labs were notable for hct 14.7 --> 11,
creatinine 3.5, plts 117K. CXR and head CT negative for acute
process. She was given 2u emergency release pRBCs, vanc 1g and
zosyn 4.5g and admitted to the MICU for further care.

IMAGING:
[**2138-2-12**] CXR:
1. Mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. Subtle left base
retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis, although an
early/mild superimposed consolidation cannot be entirely
excluded.
2. Slight blunting of the right costophrenic angle, trace
effusion cannot be entirely excluded.
.
[**2138-2-12**] CT Head w/o con: Suboptimal scan due to patient motion in
the scanner. With this limitation in mind, no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
[**2138-2-13**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
