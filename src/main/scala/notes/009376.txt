chest pain

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79 year old male with a history of HTN, AAA, and
approximately 70+ pack-year history who presented with
complaints of recent atypical chest pain. He states that three
days PTA he acutely developed left shoulder pain while at rest.
The pain was a [**3-5**] and over the course of a few hours
re-located to his left chest and then to his right chest and
right neck. While experiencing the pain, Pt attempted to eat
dinner and vomited once. Two days prior to admission Pt
developed a pleuritic chest pain, but states that he otherwise
felt normal. He denies nausea, diaphoresis, lightheadedness,
palpitations, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.  On the day
of admission Pt was seen at his PCP's office for a scheduled
visit where he was noted to have been hypertensive in the
setting of atrial fibrillation (which was new for him).  ECG
reportedly showed anterior ST elevation concerning for a new
infarct. Pt was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, Vitals HR 130 atrial fibrillation, BP 153/115 -
225/121, Satting 97% on 2L. ECG showed irregular narrow complex
tachycardia interpreted was atrial fibrillation with RVR with
STE in V1-V3. He was given diltiazem and aspirin. Prior to
transfer to the floor Pt reverted to normal sinus rhythm.

ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
unavailable) of [**2155-2-12**], probably no major change.

CT with contrast
1. Significant increase in size of infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm with
increased thrombus. No evidence of leak. Given the current size,
urgent
surgical consult is advised.
2. Slight increase in diameter of the left common iliac artery,
now up to
2.9-cm. Stable dilation of the right common iliac.
3. No aortic dissection. No pulmonary embolus.
4. Right apical and right lower lobe (subpleural) pulmonary
nodules in the
setting of emphysema warrant followup in [**5-7**] months [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) 8773**]
guidelines.
5. Right renal hypodensities likely represent cysts. Stable
appearance of
atrophic left kidney.
6. Small pericardial and left pleural effusion.
7. Enlarged prostate, correlate with PSA.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 79 yo male with a history of hypertension, AAA, and COPD
with chest pain and he was noted to be in rapid afib and had
hypertensive urgency. Initially his ECG showed st changes that
were atributed to his fast rate. His rate was controled on IV
metoprolol which was transitioned to oral. His CE were mildly
elevated but not in the ACS range. ECHO did not show WMA or
change in EF. Ultimately his ECH changes were atributed to the
tachycardia. He was initially placed on heparin ggt, aspirin and
atorvastatin which were discontinued when acs was considered
unlikely. He declined any possibility of catheterization, even
if that would be of diagnostic value. He is being discharged on
his home medications. We recomeded that he take EC aspirin, as
this would be less likely to cause GI upset (he wasnt taking
regular asa for gi upsets). His hypertension was intially
treated with nitro ggt, which was then transitioned to his oral
regimen. With regards to his h/o AAA, this was mildly increased
in size. He again declined the possibility of surgical
intervention. We strongly recomended that he stop smoking. Also
his blood pressure should be less than 125/80 to minimilize the
risk of rupture.

stable


Discharge Instructions:
You had an irregular heart rhythm that was very rapid and caused

echocardiogram did not show any evidence of a heart attack.
Medication changes:
1. START albuterol inhaler: to use when you feel wheezes or have
trouble breathing
2. START aspirin to prevent blood clots
.
It is very important to your health that you stop smoking.
Please see the information given to you on admission regarding
smoking cessation.
.
Please call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4844**] if you have further chest pain, increased
