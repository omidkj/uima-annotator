History of Present Illness:
84y M w h/o CAD (90% stenosis of LAD with BMS deployed in '[**87**]),
HTN, a-fib on coumadin, s/p recent right colectomy, transferred
from OSH for A-fib w/ RVR and later developed hypotension in the
ED.
.
Per family, pt was in his USOH, not conversant, but actively
communicating with motion and letters pointing.  Last night, pt
became suddenly dyspneic, with some question of chest pain, with
blood pressure at 230/115 (baseline 104/59 in the AM).  Pt was
sent to the [**Hospital 882**] hospital and was found to be in A. fib with
RVR with lateral ST changes.  ABG showed pH 7.25, PCO2 86. They
gave him 30 mg of IV diltiazem which was able to control him
into the 90s. He also received iv morphine 2 mg, and 1 inch of
nitro paste.  Per family request, pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] at
midnight.  Pt had some cough with sputum on last Saturday,
several bouts of watery diarrhea yesterday, but otherwise
healthy at his baseline.
.
Of note, pt was recently admitted for BRBPR from diverticulosis
bleed ([**Date range (1) 103669**]).  He underwent an explore lapratomy with right
hemicolectomy.  However, the post-op course was complicated by
fascial dehiscence, which required wound exploration and VAC.
While on ventilation, he developed VAP, difficult to wean off
vent and had tracheostomy.  He also had PEG tube placement,
chest tube placement.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **], Pt's initial VS 112, 128/55, 24, 100% on AC mode 50%
500X24 with ABG of pH 7.33, 72/47.  However 30 mins later, pt's
BP was 79/48.  Pt received 1L NS.  BP increased to 90s.
However, his BP later dropped again.  L femoral line was placed.
 Pt received one dose of vancomycin, zosyn, and was placed on
phenylephrine gtt.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt was afebrile with VS HR 72, BP
104/57.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  84yM w h/o CAD (90% stenosis of LAD with
BMS deployed in '[**87**]), HTN, & LE edema recently admitted for
BRBPR s/p total colectomy, now presenting with Chest pain,
admitted to the MICU for hypotension.
.
#.hypotension - The patient was admitted to the MICU in part due
to hypotension.  The patient develop afib with RVR and was given
nitro, diltiazem, and morphine at OSH.  Shortly after arrival at
ED, the patient develop hypotension and was started on a
levophed gtt and transferred to the MICU.  The levophed gtt was
quickly weaned within hours of arriving the in MICU and the
patient remained normotensive for the remainer of the
hospitalization.  Pt was started on vancomycin and zosyn one day
prior to admission at [**Hospital1 18**] at rehab.  Pt remained afebrile,
with no cough or sputum production or bandemia.  We felt that
the suspicion of pneumonia was low, and we discontinued his
antibiotics during this admission.
.
#. respiratory failure: Initially presented with respiratory
failure that was like due to mucous plugging.  Empiric
antibotics of vanco and zosyn were started at an OSH.  These
antibiotics were stopped after negative blood and sputum
cultures and rapid improvement (he was able to come off the vent
day 2 of admission).  Nebs were also given prn.  The patient was
place back on the vent on day 3 of hospitalzation for 24 hours.
A CXR at the time was consistent with bilateral pulmonary edema
and after agressive diuresis, the patient respiratory status
improved.
.
#.Afib with RVR: On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the tachycardia was much
resolved.  In the MICU, he was continued with diltiazem, which
was uptitrated to 60 QID.  His home dose of coumadin was also
continued.  Daily INR were within range of [**12-29**].
.
#.diarrhea-The patient was admitted on PO vanco for empiric
coverage of C.diff colitis.  Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab records, he had
one negative C. diff.  Two repeat C. diff toxin were negative
here during this admission and PO vanco was stopped, although
the patient continued to have watery non-bloody diarrhea.  The
diarrhea was likely due to emperic antibotics (see above).  The
diarrhea resolved after antibiotics were stopped.
.
#. delerium- The patient mental status waxed and wane.  On the
second day of hospitalization he pull out his IV and was picking
at his skin and BP cuff.  He was started on zyprexia 2.5 [**Hospital1 **],
and haldol prn for agitation.  His agitation improved.  EKG were
monitor for prolong QTc.
.
# s/p hemicolectomy: secondary intention wound healing, healthy
appearing wound.
cholestyramine was continued
.
# hypothyroidism his home dose of levothyroxine 25 mcg was
continued
.
# anemia: dropped after surgery, but stable throughout
hospitalization.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Medication changes:
- INCREASED diltiazem to 240 mg daily (prior dose was 160 mg
daily)
- STARTED lasix 80 mg po daily
- STARTED olanzapine 5 mg [**Hospital1 **]
.
# Recommendations from speech therapy:
1. ALWAYS DEFLATE CUFF PRIOR TO PLACING THE PASSY-MUIR VALVE!
2. Monitor O2 Sats / respiration while valve is in place.
3. Do not allow the patient to sleep with the valve in place.
4. PMV wear schedule is up to the discretion of the nurse and/or
respiratory therapist.
5. Swallow evaluation in the next 1-2 days if pt continues to
tolerate trach collar/PMV.
6. We will f/u if pt remains in this facility. He will benefit
from intensive swallowing services upon d/c to rehab.
