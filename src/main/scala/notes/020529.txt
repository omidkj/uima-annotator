History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo woman wwith a history of hypertension, congestive heart
failure (EF unknown), idiopathic emphysema, frequent PNAs in
last year, who presented with mental status change, bradycardia
(HR 20-30s), hypotension (SBP 60s), and hypothermia (T 92.3).
  Per report from her son (and HCP), the patient has appeared
tired & slightly off her baseline for few days PTA.  He noted
her speech was slowed, more deliberate & slightly slurred.  On
day of admission, after finishing [**Holiday 1451**] dinner, she was
noted to be fatigued.  Family members noted that she was unable
to get up from chair & walk.  She c/o "dizziness" & shooting
pain in neck.  She had increased confusion & followed by
LOC/episode of unresponsiveness (while sitting).  EMS was called
and, on their arrival, noted her HR was in 20-30s & SBP was in
60s.  She was transcutaneously paced by EMS.
Of note, pt reportedly coughing & appeared dyspneic for ~1wk
PTA.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old female admitted with bradycardia, hypotension,
hypothermia, and altered mental status, most likely secondary to
septic shock from E-coli UTI.
.
1. Septic shock:  The patient was admitted with bradycardia,
hypotension, hypothermia, and hypotension, all felt to be
manifestations of septic shock secondary to her E. coli UTI. She
was resuscitated with IVF and required pressors which were
eventually discontinued on [**1-1**]. She was initially treated with
ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Her urine culture revealed a
pan-sensitive E coli and thus azithromycin was discontinued.
While in the ICU, the decision was made to change her code
status to CMO on [**1-3**] and ceftriaxone was discontinued at that
time. She was transferred out to the regular medical floor.
.
2. Respiratory failure: She was initially intubated for airway
protection secondary to unstable mental status.  She was
diuresed to minimize pulmonary vascular congestion.  She was
extubated on [**2171-1-1**] without complication. CXR showed bilateral
pleural effusions, felt secondary to her CHF. She was diuresed
with lasix as her blood pressure tolerated. On discharge, she is
sat'ing well on 3L NC however she continues to complain of
shortness of breath and dyspnea with even minor movement.
.
3. UTI: The patient was admitted with septic shock secondary to
E. coli UTI. She was partially treated in the MICU with
ceftriaxone, which was discontinued on [**1-3**] when she was made
CMO. Antibiotics were re-initiated on the floor. She was treated
with PO levofloxacin with plan for a 14 day course. Last dose
will be on [**1-19**].
.
4. Clostridium dificile: The patient developed c diff infection
with positive stool toxin noted on [**1-8**]. She was started on PO
metronidazole for a 14 day course. Last day will be [**1-22**].
.
5. Bradycardia:  She was initially bradycardic to 20s
transiently with bundle branch block on EKG. Question of
beta-blocker toxicity with acute on chronic renal failure.  She
received glucagon 5mg x3 & calcium without significant response.
 To assess cardiac function, a TTE was obtained demonstrating EF
45-50%, mild regional L ventricular dysfunction, probable
diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary HTN.  EKG also
demonstrated old RBBB, old LAFB, and ST depressions in inferior
and lateral precordial leads.  Likely etiology was hypotension
leading to underperfusion of coronary artery and possible
conduction system abnormalities.  She was placed on a dopamine
drip transiently with good response and her bradycardia resolved
soon afterwards.
.
6. Acute renal failure: In the setting of septic shock and
hypotension, she developed acute renal failure. Her creatinine
was elevated to 2.3 on admission, felt likely to represent
pre-renal renal failure. Her creatinine returned to baseline by
[**1-7**].
.
7. ?Myocardial ischemia: There was concern initially for
ACS/ischemia in the setting of hypotension and EKG revealing ST
depressions.  However, she had not complained of CP (per family)
& 2 sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.  She was continued on
ASA with no BB given conduction disease.
.
8. CHF: Her home regimen of furosemide 80mg PO daily was
initially held because of hypotension and transient need for
pressors. Given amount of fluid pt given for resuscitation (9L)
she was eventually diuresed over the course of her MICU stay
with good r
