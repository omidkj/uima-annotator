CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: Extensive small bowel and cecal pneumatosis and
dilatation, with portal venous air and possible rectal
hemorrhage and small intra-abdominal ascites, consistent with
bowel infarct. Extensive atherosclerotic disease with likely
near-complete occlusion of the SMA at baseline and possible
supervening embolic disease which could not be confirmed on
current non-contrast exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team and underwent
abdominal CT imaging showing extensive small bowel and cecal
pneumatosis and dilatation, with
portal venous air and possible rectal hemorrhage and small
intra-abdominal
ascites, consistent with bowel infarct. He was taken to the
operating room for an ileo cecectomy. There were no
complications. Postoperatively while in the PACU he was noted to
be in atrial fibrillation with RVR. Of note he has a history of
Afib. He was given Diltiazem and started on a drip and was then
transferred to the surgical ICU for ongoing monitoring.

His rate was eventually controlled and the Diltiazem drip was
stopped. His home cardiac medications were restarted; the
Labetalol did require an increased adjustment. he was seen by
his [**Hospital1 **] cardiologist and will follow up as an
outpatient after discharge. His heart rate at time of discharge
ranged within the low to mid 70's.

His bowel function was slow to return and therefore his diet
advanced slowly. He was given a one time dose of
Methylnaltrexone on POD# 4 with large bowel movement resulting.
He is tolerating a regular diet at this time and his home
medications were restarted.

It should also be mentioned that at time of admission he was
noted with a sacral wound that is 3 x 0.5 x 1 cm with approx
0.25 cm of undermining
around periphery; the peri wound tissue is badly macerated and
there are skin tags adjacent to the wound. There is a mild mal
odor. The wound bed is dark red, not healthy or granulating. Per
patient this has been present for several months and visiting
nurses at home are packing it with aquacel daily. He is being
discharged to home with nurses services.
