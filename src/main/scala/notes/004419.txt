Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2161-7-13**] cardiac catheterization with placement of drug eluding
stent to proximal LAD
[**2161-7-15**] cardiac catheterization, no interventions


History of Present Illness:
51M with PMHx of untreated hypertension and tobacco use
previously evaluated in the ED 2 weeks ago for ROMI without
ischemic changes on exercise stress now here with anterior STEMI
s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1 to proximal LAD. Patient describes 3 weeks of
intermittent left-sided chest pain oftentimes worse with
exertion and frequently associated with diaphoresis, and nausea.
Denies radiation but does describe it occasionally waking him
from sleep. Presented to ED 2 weeks ago where he had ROMI and
exercise EKG stress during which he had anginal symptoms but not
ischemic EKG changes. He was discharged without resolution of
his chest pain. In the interim it has continued and he describes
having a severe episode 4 days ago which did not get better with
ibuprofen 800mg or 300mg gabapentin (he borrowed from friend)
but resolved for 2 hours following 40grams of alcohol but
returned thereafter. He was seen today by his PCP who performed
an EKG with, per report, STE's and was referred emergently to
the ED for ACS.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.2, 100, 158/117, 16, 98% 4LNC
Labs and imaging significant for trop 0.87; CBC, Chem 7, and
coags unremarkable, EKG with ST @ 102bpm, NA/NI, STE's in V1-V3,
TWI's in I, aVL, V4-5
Patient given Aspirin 325mg, Metoprolol 5mg IV x1, Clopidogrel
300mg PO x 1, Metoprolol tartrate 25mg PO x1, Heparin drip
started, code STEMI called, taken urgently to cath lab where she
had [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 1 to proximal LAD.

On the floor, the patient is pain free and calm. He describes
that over the past week he has had significant DOE and
exertional fatigue. He states it usually takes him 15 mins to
walk to work from home but earlier this week it took him 55 mins
because he wasn't able to walk fast and had to stop to rest. He
denies orthopnea, PND, frequent urination, abdominal pain, V/D,
urinary symptoms, or other concerns.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
----------------
Coronary Catheterization [**2161-7-13**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated single vessel
coronary
artery disease.  The LMCA had no obstructive disease.  The LAD
had a 95%
proximal stenosis.  The LCx and RCA had minimal disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
pressure with
central aortic pressure 131/90 with mean 62 mmHg.
3. Successful PCI of the proximal LAD 95% stenosis by
direct-stenting
with a 2.25 x 16 mm Promus element drug-eluting stent.
4. Successful deployment of Exoseal to right femoral arteriotomy
site
with excellent hemostasis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the proximal LAD with a 2.25 x 16 mm promus
element
drug-eluting stent.

TTE [**2161-7-14**]:
Conclusions
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
mid anterior, mid anteroseptal, distal LV and apical akinesis. A
large apical thrombus is seen in the left ventricle (2.0 x 1.2
cm). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Depressed LVEF c/w prior MI with large apical LV
thrombus.
.
.
TTE [**2161-7-20**] The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokensis/akensis
of the distal 2/3rds of the anteroseptum and anterior walls,
distal inferior wall, and apex. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 30 %). There is a 1.3cm mural apical thrombus.
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with severe
regional systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD (prox/mid LAD
distribution). Apical mural thrombus. Mild mitral regurgitation
with normal valve morphology. Dilated aortic root.
