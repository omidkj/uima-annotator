Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old woman who
has not sought medical treatment in many years and had a
recent fall fracturing her right humerus and soon thereafter
she was noted to have some irregular heart beat.  She took
some medication of a neighbor who had a similar problem and
ultimately went to be treated in the Emergency Department in
[**State 108**] where the patient lived.  She was found at that time
to be in atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response in
the 130s.  This spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm but
she has had bouts of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since
that time.  At that time, echocardiogram was obtained which
demonstrated significant mitral valve prolapse with severe
mitral regurgitation and a large ventriculoseptal defect with
a left to right shunt.  Left ventricular function was normal.
She was also noted to have moderate to severe pulmonary
artery hypertension.  The patient was discharged from the
hospital on beta blocker, Lipitor and Coumadin at that time
and she has since come to the [**Location (un) 86**] area to seek further
treatment of this.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for at least two previous
bouts of endocarditis, one in [**2050**] and one in [**2070**] which was
treated with antibiotics with no sequelae.  She has also had
three uneventful pregnancies and has not taken any
medications regularly and has not had any medical treatment
over the past 20 years or so.  The patient was admitted to
the hospital [**7-10**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient also states an allergy to Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
[**Month (only) 8863**] XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin 5 mg Monday, Wednesday
and Friday and 2.5 mg alternating four days per week.  She
was also taking Alprazolam for anxiety.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2103-7-10**] and taken directly to the Operating Room where
she underwent mitral valve repair with a #28 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**]
annuloplasty band as well as tricuspid valve repair with a
#32 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty ring and a primary
closure of ventriculoseptal defect.  Postoperatively the
patient was transported from the Operating Room to the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in stable condition on
Milrinone, Neo-Synephrine and Propofol intravenous drips.
She was initially atrioventricularly paced with an adequate
blood pressure.  The pacemaker was ultimately turned off the
following morning and she was in normal sinus rhythm with
first degree atrioventricular block.  On postoperative day
#1, the patient remained with a Swan-Ganz catheter and the
Milrinone was weaned off, the Neo-Synephrine had been
discontinued, the patient was weaned from mechanical
ventilation and successfully extubated to nasal cannula
oxygen.  Diuretics were begun on postoperative day #1.  On
postoperative day #2 it was noted that the patient had
significant thrombocytopenia, after being started on heparin.
The heparin was discontinued.  Heparin antibodies were sent
and have subsequently come back negative.  The patient
remained on intravenous Neo-Synephrine throughout the course
of postoperative day #2 which was ultimately discontinued
late that day.  On postoperative day #3, the patient was
continued with aggressive diuresis, was hemodynamically
stable and remained in normal sinus rhythm at that time.  On
postoperative day #4 the patient's chest tubes had been
removed.  The patient remained with adequate heart rhythm and
rate and blood pressure and was transferred out from the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit to the Telemetry Floor.  The
patient was begun ambulating with physical therapy and
tolerating that well.  Her Foley catheter was discontinued
and she was voiding without problems.  On postoperative day
#5, the patient was noted to have some atrial fibrillation
with a ventricular response rate between 90 and 125.  She was
treated with Magnesium and intravenous Lopressor and she was
placed on Amiodarone as well.  The patient converted to
normal sinus rhythm later that day and had had no subsequent
atrial fibrillation while on the Lopressor and the
Amiodarone.  The patient continued to progress with physical
therapy on [**2103-7-17**].  The patient was still unable to be
weaned completely from oxygen due to desaturation.  Chest
x-ray was obtained.  She also had symptomatic shortness of
breath.  The chest x-ray from the previous day revealed a
significant left pleural effusion.  On [**7-17**], she underwent
a thoracentesis for approximately 400 cc of serosanguinous
fluid.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and did
state symptomatic relief of her symptoms.  The subsequent
chest x-ray showed decreased pleural effusion although some
residual fluid remains with left lower lobe atelectasis and
no pneumothorax noted.  Today, [**2103-7-18**], the patient
remained off oxygen with adequate oxygen saturation.  On room
air her Saturday was 93 to 95%.  She remains hemodynamically
stable and is ready to be discharged home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.  Temperature is 98.6, blood
pressure 110/70, heartrate 87 in normal sinus rhythm with a
first degree atrioventricular block, respiratory rate 20.
Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented.  Her lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally, however, diminished
lung space.  Her heart rhythm is regular with no rub or
murmur noted.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  She has no peripheral edema.  The
patient is discharged today in good condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  She is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 696**], the patient's primary cardiologist in one to two
weeks.  She is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in
four weeks for a postoperative check.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Lasix 20 mg one p.o. b.i.d. times ten days
Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times ten days
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. day
Ibuprofen 400 mg p.o. q. 8 hours prn pain
Amiodarone 200 mg one p.o. q.d. to be continued for one month
or as deemed necessary by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**]

Enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Mitral regurgitation
2.  Tricuspid regurgitation
3.  Ventriculoseptal defect
4.  Status post mitral valve repair
5.  Status post tricuspid valve repair
6.  Status post ventriculoseptal defect closure
