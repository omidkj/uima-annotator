Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
"Cardiogenic Shock, CHF, Critical AS"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Attempted balloon angioplasty
CVVH
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
71-year-old man with AS undergoing CoreValve eval for critical
aortic stenosis, s/p complicated cardiac cath on [**7-10**] (hematoma)
groin p/w with CP and SOB s/p Intubation

Was at rehab after [**Hospital1 18**] admission (see below). On [**7-28**] he was
combative, delirious. On [**7-29**] he c/o CP and SOB. Sent to NVMC ED
with t98.3, HR 108, RR 18, BP 117/47, 84% on RA. He received
60mg IV lasix and BiPap. Admitted to a telemetry float. IV dapto
(600) and Gent (120) given. On [**7-30**], at 0120, he received 40mg
IV lasix for SOB and was intubated at 2am and started on
propofol. No vasopressors. CXR with "extensive fluffy
infiltrates that appeared nodular". ABG showed 7.35/40/94 on
100%Fi02, PEEP 5, TV 700 on AC at RR12. Net fluid balance was
800 negative. Cultures were drawn. WBC 6.7, Hbg 9.3, HCT 26.3,
plt 312. Na 132, K 3.6, Cl 94, HCO3 26, BUN 33, Cr 2.28 (from
1.86 overnight. ACE and BB were held due to "soft" blood
pressures. He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU intubated on
propofol.

In the CCU, he was tachy to 130 and hypotensive to 90's. His CXR
yielded a diffuse patchy infiltrate. His PICC line transduced a
CVP of 9. He received 2.5 mg of metoprolol tartrate to bring
rate to 100. EKG was unchanged despite rate decrease with
precordial ST-depressions, AVR elevation. He received 500cc of
NS bolus (250 x 2). Propofol was dc'd.

LAST ADMISSION
Was admitted on [**7-10**] with Hematoma following cardiac
catheterization which disclosed RCA disease. He had ecchymoses
throughout right  groin, including swelling and discoloration of
genitals. Ultrasound revealed pseudoaneurysm of the femoral
artery with bleeding resolved by thrombin injection, confirmed
by US. The patient developed fever on [**2120-7-15**] and increased
oxygen requirement. 8/8 bottles were growing Enterococcus
faecalis as was his urine. TTE was without vegetation. He was
treated as endocarditis.  WBC scan showed a single focus near
posterior liver, may also be in pleural space, but no reason to
believe AAA graft was infected by scan. Infectious Disease was
consulted and started patient on regimen of daptomycin (patient
had anaphylaxis to Unasyn) and gentamicin. Within 48 hours, the
patient had defeveresced. His blood cultures from [**2120-7-16**] onward
were negative.

ASSORTED PROBLEMS DURING LAST ADMISSION
During an episode of oxygen desaturation, an EKG was checked,
which showed no ST or T wave changes. The patient had troponin
elevation (0.57), but CK-MB (2) resolved. Patient's Cr rose to
1.6 from 1.2 and later fell to 1.3 on discharge. Cardiac surgery
has declined AV replacement. Patient underwent CTA chest/CT
cardiac and PFTs as part of CoreValve work-up. Episodes of
abdominal pain with negative bloodtests. RUQ ultrasound ordered
for unclear indications and showed cholelithiasis without
cholecystitis.

Past Medical History:
-Peripheral vascular disease: s/p endovascular AAA repair with a
[**Doctor Last Name **] EXCLUDER device on [**2116-5-4**]. 23 x 160 mm main body
device and a 12 x 100 mm right iliac contralateral limb device
CTA post implantation have failed to show any evidence of
endoleak. Non healing ulcer [**2118-3-22**].  He underwent
left femoral to posterior tibial bypass graft with nonreversed
saphenous [**Year (4 digits) 5703**] graft and angioscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**].
Following surgery, his left leg ulcer had improved.
-s/p right carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty [**2116-5-18**].
-Hypertension, essential
-Hyperlipidemia
-Right eye cataract last year; left cataract is pending.
-Chronic renal insufficiency
-History of osteomyelitis
-OSA
-History of GI bleed [**12/2115**]
-Chronic back pain
-Chronic tremor

Social History:
He has been living with his sister since [**2115**] with his medical
disability.  He does not currenly smoke but did smoke 3 packs
per day for 20 years.  He does not drink alcohol.
