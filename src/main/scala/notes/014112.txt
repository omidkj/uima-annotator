History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Patient is a 28yo female with PMH of
migraine headache and s/p gastric bypass who presents from home
with exertional dyspnea for two weeks, worsening over the past 2
days acutely along with intermittant chest pains. Patient was
last in her usual state of health until [**Month (only) 404**] of this year
when she underwent gastric bypass surgery. Following the
surgery, patient had difficulty taking food PO because of an
esophageal ulcer and went home with TPN via PICC. She had the
PICC for several months at home and experienced a line infection
that led to PICC replacement. A second PICC was placed and
patient continued to receive home TPN, but in [**Month (only) 116**] of this year,
began to not answer her door to nurses that came to visit to
change the dressing. She did this volitionally because she did
not want to interact with them. She continued to self-administer
TPN at home for 2-3 weeks during which time the dressing was not
changed and pus began to ooze from around the PICC site. She
continued to infuse TPN and one night the PICC fell out in her
sleep. She then presented to the hospital where she was found to
have pulmonary embolisms and septic pulmonary emboli. She was
discharged for this and later re-presented from home to outside
hospital in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year where she was found to have
pneumonia and had a large right pleural effusion, drained with
chest tube. She was discharged home and continued on IV
Rocephan. She is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], infectious disease in
[**Hospital1 487**].

At home for the past 2-3 weeks she developed dyspnea on
exertion. Over the past 2-3 days the dyspnea worsened and she
developed fevers at home to 102. She presented to the ED for
evaluation at [**Hospital1 487**].

In the ED, initial VS were: T97.9 HR92 BP122/90 RR15 O2sat:99%
A bedside cardiac echo: Tricuspid valve vegetation, poor right
ventricular filling, no clear strain. She was started on
vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. She had a head CT which
confirmed no brain septic emboli and a chest CTA which showed
the presence of multiple pulmonary septic emboli. She was
started on IV heparin.

On arrival to the MICU, VS T98.4, HR85, BP121/85, RR22, O2sat:
100%RA. She has continued stable chest pain. She is in no acute
distress.

IMAGING:

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2135-10-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Left interlobar artery, superior lingular and left
posterobasal segment embili have a septic embolic apperance.
2.  Multifocal nodular opacities in both lungs consistent with
septic emboli.
3.  Enlarged right atrium, no right ventricular right heart
strain.
4.  Left upper lobe intrapulmonary congenital bronchogenic cyst.


CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2135-10-28**]
FINDINGS: No comparison studies. There are multifocal bilateral
nodular
ground-glass opacities.  Concurrent CTA of the chest better
evaluates this. The cardiomediastinal shilhouette and hila are
normal. No pleural effusion, no pneumothorax.

CT HEAD W/ CONTRAST Study Date of [**2135-10-28**]
IMPRESSION:  No acute process.  No evidence of septic emboli.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2135-10-29**]
The appearance of the lungs is similar compared to the study
from the prior day compatible with patient's known history of
endocarditis and septic emboli.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2135-10-31**]
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either right
or left lower extremity.

Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2135-11-1**]
IMPRESSION: Moderate-s
