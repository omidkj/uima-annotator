History of Present Illness:
78 yo f s/p L CEA on [**2-1**] (discharged on [**2-2**]) felt gradually
worsening SOB the night of discharge from hospital. She denied
chest, arm, or jaw pain. She awoke from sleep with increased
SOB, and had episode of syncope after using the bathroom.
Directly before syncopal episode, she denied CP, palpitations,
urinary/stool incontinence, and weakness, confusion, or
paresthesias afterwards. She was heard by her family moaning in
the bathroom and was brought to OSH. At the OSH, EKG showed
sinus tachycardia @ 98bpm, TWI in V6, and STE in I, AvL, V5, and
V6. STD was observed in inferior leads. CEs revealed troponin I
0.89, D-dimer 3.52, and BNP 920. PE revealed crackles. She was
treated with ASA/NG/BB/plavix/heparin for STEMI. She was also
given 20mg IV lasix for reduction of pulm edema. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization.

Brief Hospital Course:
At the OSH on [**2-2**], EKG showed findings c/w anterolateral STEMI.
 Cardiac enzymes were elevated.  At the OSH she was treated with
ASA/NG/BB/plavix/heparin, and after treatment her ST segment
elevations resolved.  At [**Hospital1 18**], cardiac catheterization revealed
significant occlusion in the LCx, RCA, and LAD, as well as
moderate 2+ MR.  In the CCU, the patient was managed on a
medical regimen including ASA/BB/nitro gtt/ACEi/heparin/high
dose statin. She was evaluated for CABG +/- MVR.  On [**2-3**], her
nitro gtt was discontinued given lack of symptoms and stable BP.

On [**2-4**], an echocardiogram was done, showing small secundum
atrial septal defect; mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal severe hypokinesis of the distal septum,
distal anterior and distal inferior walls; mild
dyskinetic/aneurysm at apex; normal RV free wall motion;
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation with an eccentric, inferiorly
directed jet.
She was taken to the OR on [**2182-2-5**] where she underwent an MVR
(27mm tissue valve) and CABG X 3 (LIMA > LAD, SVG > OM, SVG >
PLV).  She was taken to the cardiac surgery recovery unit on NTG
& Epi drips.  She went into rapid AFib on POD # 1, requiring
cardioversion, amiodarone started.  She subsequently had some
heart block, requiring temporary pacing, and her native
conduction recovered in the next few days.
On [**2-11**], she was extubated, but required re-intubaltio for
tachypnea and hypoxia.  Several more attempts were made at
weaning her from the ventilator, but each time she was weaned to
minimal support, she again became tachypneic and hypoxic.  She
underwent tracheostomy on [**2182-2-18**].  She continued with supportive
care, and slow ventilator weaning.
On [**2182-2-25**], an infectious disease consult was obtained for
fevers to 102.  Sputum and urine cultures revealed pseudomonas.
There was 1 positive blood culture (out of bottles) for coag.
negative staph.  Central line culture was negative.  Chest &
sinus CT scans were negative, as was her lower extremity
doppler.  The recommendation was to place her on antibiotics for
7-10 days for presumed pseudomonas pneumonia.  A midline
catheter was placed for antibiotics.
She has now remained afebrile since [**2182-2-28**], and has been off
the ventilator on a trach collar since [**2182-3-1**].  She has
intermittantly used a Passey Muir valve for speech.  She remains
hemodynamically stable, and is ready for transfer to rehab for
continued speech, respiratory, and physical therapy.
