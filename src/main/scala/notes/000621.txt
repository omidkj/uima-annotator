[**Hospital3 417**] Medical Center.  The patient has known history
of bilateral carotid stenosis.  He is a 79-year-old white
male with known coronary artery disease and status post
angioplasty, hypertension, insulin dependent diabetic,
hypercholesterolemia, COPD who presented to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital after undergoing arteriography for carotid disease
with chest pain.  He was begun on Heparin.  CKs were
obtained.  The initial CK was 197, MB 3.1, index 1.7,
troponin 0.05.  He was transferred to our institution for
further evaluation and treatment.

ALLERGIES:  Pepcid and Codeine cause rash.

MEDICATIONS:  On transfer were Zestril 10 mg q d,
Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg q d, Lasix 20 mg q d, Aspirin 81 mg
q d, Terazosin 2 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, Meclizine
12.5 mg tid, Novolin insulin 70/30 units, 8 units at
breakfast and at supper, Zantac 150 mg [**Hospital1 **], Glyburide 5 mg
[**Hospital1 **], Amlodipine 10 mg daily, Albuterol MDI 2 puffs q 6 hours,

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former tobacco smoker, greater than 100 pack
years.  Has not smoked over the last 12 years.  Former
alcohol abuse, now never.

LABORATORY DATA:  Transfer labs included CBC with white count
of 7.8, hematocrit 33.6, platelet count 109,000.  Coags were
normal.  BUN 37, creatinine 1.3, potassium 4.6, CK here in
our ER was 146.  EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm at 66,
normal axis, T waves are flat and AVL biphasic in V6.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, 97.9, 190/66, 218.  He is
alert, in no acute distress.  Neck exam shows no jugulovenous
distension with bilateral carotid bruits.  Chest is clear to
auscultation bilaterally without adventitious sounds.  Heart
is regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the apex.  Abdomen is unremarkable.  Extremities
are without edema.  Neurologically he is intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent on [**1-7**] a left heart
cath which showed an ejection fraction of 55%, left ventricle
showed atrial, lateral and apical wall hypokinesis.  The
right coronary artery showed a stenosis in the mid of 60%.
The left main trunk was normal.  Left anterior descending
showed 70% in the proximal portion.  The diagonal I showed
70% in the proximal portion.  The left main circumflex was
totally occluded.  Obtuse marginal was totally occluded.  The
patient underwent angioplasty of the obtuse marginal on right
coronary arteries with stenting.  He tolerated the procedure
well.  On [**1-18**] the patient had mental status changes
associated with right upper quadrant weakness and expressive
receptive aphasia.  Neurology was consulted at that time and
head CT was obtained.  Head CT with contrast was obtained.
There was no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute
infarct vs retention cyst noted in the right maxillary sinus.
An MRI was obtained 48 hours later which demonstrated
evidence of acute infarct in the left frontal lobe.  There
were some questionable changes in the right frontal lobe,
question whether this was a neoplasm.  These were restudied
and this was negative for neoplasm.  The patient underwent a
left carotid endarterectomy on [**1-22**] without complications.
The remaining hospital course was unremarkable.  The patient
was discharged to rehab for further rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril 80 mg q d, Terazosin 2 mg
q d, Meclizine 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], Ipratropium bromide puffs 2 qid,

d, Lasix 20 mg q d, Novolin 70/30 insulin 5 units q a.m. and

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Bilateral carotid stenosis, left greater than right,
status post left CEA, middle cerebral artery infarct.
2.  Hypertension controlled.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Insulin dependent diabetes controlled.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable.
6.  Coronary artery disease status post angioplasty with
stent of the obtuse marginal I and left circumflex.
