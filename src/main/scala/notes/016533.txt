CXR:
[**2188-5-6**] PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient
in upright
the right-sided chest tube has been removed. There is no further
collapse of the right lung however the small apical pneumothorax
remains rather unchanged in size. A left sided small amount of
pleural effusion blunts the left lateral and posterior pleural
sinus mildly. No new abnormalities are identified.
[**2188-5-5**] Left pleural effusion and lower lobe atelectasis are
not significantly changed. Linear opacity at the right lung base
remains most consistent with atelectasis. There is new
superimposed opacity in the right lower lobe, the rapid interval
development of which suggests asymmetric mild pulmonary edema.
Small right pleural effusion is also increased, likely with a
loculated component adjacent to the thoracotomy site. The right
chest tube remains in place, and tiny right apical pneumothorax
has decreased.
[**2188-5-2**]  Right apical pneumothorax increased, still small. A
right chest tube is in unchanged position. Lung volumes are
lower and right basilar opacities, likely atelectasis increased,
now moderate-to-severe. Small left pleural effusion is new.
Right basilar opacities also increased, likely atelectasis.
Perihilar opacities are also likely due to atelectasis.
[**2188-4-30**] Newly inserted right-sided chest tube. Moderate air
collections in the soft tissues, no visible right-sided
pneumothorax. Surgical material projecting over the right main
bronchus. Left-sided line in situ. Left basal atelectasis.
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 60965**] was admitted on [**2188-4-30**] for Right thoracotomy and
thoracic tracheoplasty with mesh, right main stem bronchus and
bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh, left main stem
bronchoplasty with mesh, bronchoscopy with aspiration.  She was
She was extubated in the operating room, monitored in the PACU
prior to transfer to the SICU.  The chest-tube on suction
draining moderate amounts of serosanguinous fluid and was
subsequently removed POD6.  She was followed by serial chest
films which showed a stable right apical pneumothorax, left
lower lobe effusion and atelectasis.    She had good pain
control via Bupivacaine/Hydromorphone Epidural managed by the
acute pain service. This was removed on POD5.  She converted to
PO pain medications and NSAIDS with good pain control. On POD1
she was seen by ENT for hoarseness which showed bilateral true
vocal folds mobile and WNL.  Overall she has very dry mucosa in
the upper airway.  They recommended humidified air and PPI [**Hospital1 **].
Aggressive pulmonary toilet and nebs were continued. Her
respiratory status improved with oxygen saturations in the high
90's on room air. She was gently diuresised. Tolerated a clear
liquid diet. She was seen by physical therapy who recommended
rehab.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
