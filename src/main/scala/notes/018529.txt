CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2127-12-24**] 9:09 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old man s/p fall, extubated [**12-18**], febrile
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval infiltrate
INDICATION: Status post fall.

Portable AP chest. The lung fields are clear. No pneumothorax.
The heart size is normal. Mediastinal contours are normal. No
pleural effusions. No evidence of rib fracture.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2127-12-24**] 1:23 PM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT

Reason: S/P TRAUMA; EVAL FOR THROMBUS

INDICATION: Trauma. Evaluate for thrombus.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination
of both lower extremity venous systems was performed. Normal
compressibility, color flow, waveform, and augmentation was seen
in both common femoral veins, superficial femoral veins, and
popliteal veins. No intraluminal thrombus was identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.

CT ORBITS, SELLA & IAC W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-12-16**] 9:05 AM

CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST; CT ORBITS, SELLA & IAC W/ & W/

Reason: Progression of right orbital derangement.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old man with multiple orbital fractures and small
SAH/SDH s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Progression of right orbital derangement.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Multiple orbital fractures and intracranial bleeds
status post fall, question progression of right orbital
derangement.

COMPARISON: Head CT, [**2127-12-15**] at 16:30.

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the sinuses without and after the
administration of contrast were reviewed.

FINDINGS: The post-septal extraconal right hematoma is not
significantly changed from the 17-hour interval but enlarged
since [**2126-12-14**]. The hematoma measures approximately 2 cm in
greatest diameter and is located superomedially beneath a
displaced right orbital roof fracture and also exhibits
displacement of the superior rectus, oblique, and medial rectus
muscles. There is continued elongated deformity of the right
globe from hematoma-induced mass effect. The optic nerve itself
is not significantly displaced. Post- contrast imaging does not
demonstrate rim enhancement of the extraconal collection to
indicate organized abscess formation, but superimposed infection
cannot be excluded by imaging. Otherwise, the examination is
unchanged, with multiple orbital fractures and sinus fractures
as previously described. Fluid is present throughout the
paranasal sinuses.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in post-septal extraconal
right superomedial hematoma with right globe distortion from
mass effect. The urgency of these findings was discussed with
the ophthalmology resident caring for the patient, [**12-16**] at
1 p.m.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-12-16**] 9:13 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: re-eval of intraparenchymal brain lesions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
re-eval of intraparenchymal brain lesions
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Re-evaluation of intraparenchymal brain
lesions.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT.

FINDINGS: There has been no change from yesterday's examination
in the appearance of the brain or the multiple intraparenchymal
hemorrhages with the exception that the left parietal
extra-axial collection appears to perhaps be slightly more
prominent. The extraconal hematoma in the right orbit is
likewise unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Slight increase in left parietal extra-axial blood
collection. Otherwise, stable appearance of brain and orbits
compared to the previous exam.

MR L SPINE SCAN  [**2127-12-12**] 2:26 PM

MR L SPINE SCAN

Reason: evluate L1 burst fracture

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old man s/p fall with multiple skull fx, ICH, L1 burst
fx, intubated
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evluate L1 burst fracture
MRI OF THE LUMBAR SPINE

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient is status post fall with multiple
skull fractures and L1 burst fracture, for further evaluation of
the fracture.

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T1 and T2
axial images of the lumbar spine were acquired.

FINDINGS: The T12 and L1 vertebral bodies demonstrate increased
signal on inversion-recovery images and low signal on
T1-weighted images in the mid portion, indicative of fractures
and marrow edema. There is minimal decrease in height of the L1
vertebral body seen. There is no retropulsion noted. There is no
evidence of destruction of the ligamentous structures
identified. There is no evidence of abnormal increased signal
seen within the intraspinous ligaments.

From T11-12 to L4-5, no significant disc bulge or herniation is
seen. At L5- S1 level, there is mild disc bulging seen.
Bilateral spondylolysis of L5 is noted without marrow edema
indicating chronic spondylolysis.

Note is made of fluid-fluid level within the distal thecal sac
in the sacral spinal canal indicative of small amount of
intrathecal blood which could be secondary to subarachnoid blood
seen on the head CT.

The distal spinal cord shows normal signal intensities.

IMPRESSION: Signal changes indicative of fractures of T12 and L1
without significant retropulsion or high-grade thecal sac
compression. No evidence of epidural or subdural hematoma in the
spine. Fluid-fluid level indicating intrathecal blood within the
distal thecal sac, which could be related to subarachnoid
hemorrhage seen on the head CT. Bilateral spondylolysis of L5
which appear chronic due to absence of signal changes on
inversion-recovery images with mild disc bulging at L5-S1 level.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2127-12-11**] 1:27 PM

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST; CT RECONSTRUCTION

Reason: FALL

INDICATION: Status post 12 foot fall
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images of the cervical spine with
coronal and sagittal reformations were reviewed.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: No fractures of the cervical spine are identified.
There is anatomic vertebral body alignment. There is no
prevertebral soft tissue swelling. The patient is intubated with
the tip of the endotracheal tube in standard position. A
nasogastric tube is also present within the esophagus. There is
no facet joint or vertebral disc widening. C1 through T2 are
well visualized. Although CT is not optimal for evaluation of
the intrathecal contents, the visualized intrathecal contents
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.
