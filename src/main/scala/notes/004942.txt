Admission Date:  [**2113-12-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2113-12-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2053-1-13**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint is chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 37557**] is a 60-year-old
gentleman with no prior medical history who was in his usual
state of health until three days ago when he noted upper
respiratory infection symptoms consisting of cough,
rhinorrhea, and a sore throat.  Then he noted the sudden
onset of chest ache at 4 a.m. on [**2113-11-29**].

This chest ache was initially dull but increased with
inspiration and was relieved by sitting forward.  The patient
was able to go back to sleep, and when he woke up at 7 a.m.,
he noticed that the pain was somewhat decreased in its
intensity.  He went to work as a carpenter (as he would do
routinely), and he noticed that the chest pain was recurring
and becoming more intense throughout the day.  He denies an
increase in the pain with exertion or any shortness of
breath.  He also denies any diaphoresis and denies any nausea
or vomiting.

That night, he reported to [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency
Department complaining of [**8-5**] chest pain.  His temperature
at that time was 99.6, and he was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate in the 150s.  He was given
Lopressor, Cardizem, and an esmolol drip with his blood
pressure decreasing to 80/palpitation.  He was also given
sublingual nitroglycerin and aspirin with improvement of his
chest pain from an intensity of [**8-5**] to [**6-5**].  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further management.

En route from [**Hospital3 3583**] to [**Hospital1 190**], he received intravenous morphine with almost
complete resolution of the chest pain.  At [**Hospital1 346**], and electrocardiogram was done
which showed atrial flutter and ST elevations in leads I, II,
aVL, and V3 through V6.

Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was initially
started on heparin and Aggrastat and was admitted to the
Coronary Care Unit for possible acute coronary artery
syndrome.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   None.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a carpenter.  He is divorced and lives
with his girlfriend.  [**Name (NI) **] has three grown up children who live
nearby.  He has a 40-pack-year history of tobacco, and he
drinks about three beers per day.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His mother died of a heart attack at the age
of 65.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on presentation revealed temperature was 99.8, heart rate was
90, blood pressure was 101/68, oxygen saturation was 96% on 2
liters on 6 cm of water.  In general, a middle-aged male in
no acute distress.  Very pleasant.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx was clear.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  The neck revealed jugular venous
pressure around 9 cm of water.  Positive bulky 1-cm to 2-cm
anterior submandibular lymphadenopathy; mostly on the right
side.  The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Positive soft diastolic murmur loudest at the left
sternal border.  No friction rub.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities revealed no edema.  Good dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologically, a nonfocal examination.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Complete blood
count revealed white blood cell count was 24.9, hematocrit
was 46.4, and platelets were 325 at the outside hospital.
Chemistry-7 at [**Hospital1 69**] revealed
sodium was 135, potassium was 4.8, chloride was 105,
bicarbonate was 19, blood urea nitrogen was 14, creatinine
was 0.9, and blood glucose was 155.  Creatine kinase was 114.
Troponin was less than 0.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram #1 at the outside
hospital revealed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of
168.  ST elevations in V5 and V6.

Electrocardiogram #2 at the outside hospital revealed atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate of [**Street Address(2) 47000**] elevations in
leads I, aVL, and V2 through V6.  P-R elevation in lead aVR.

Electrocardiogram #1 upon arrival to [**Hospital1 190**] revealed atrial fibrillation/atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate of 93.  ST elevations in leads
I, aVL, V2 through V6; Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:   (a)  Rhythm:  Mr. [**Known lastname 37557**] is a
60-year-old gentleman with risk factors for coronary artery
disease including a long history of tobacco use, sex, age,
and family history.  Also with electrocardiogram with Q waves
in the inferior leads consistent with old inferior myocardial
infarction who presented with chest pain and ST elevations in
the lateral leads; initially suspicious for lateral ischemia.

The patient was initially started on Aggrastat and heparin
for treatment of possible acute coronary syndrome.  However,
upon further questioning and examination, it became evident
that the acute pain was caused by pericarditis.

An echocardiogram was performed which showed atrial
fibrillation which prevented the determination of the
ejection fraction and a small pericardial effusion with no
tamponade.  Heparin and Aggrastat were stopped.  The patient
was started on Motrin for relief of symptomatic pain.

The patient remained tachycardic and in atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, he was started on diltiazem and beta blocker for
rate control, and he was put on amiodarone in the hopes that
he would cardiovert; however, this did not happen, so the
patient underwent electrocardioversion with electricity at
200 joules.  He was rapidly converted.  He converted the
first time and remained in a sinus rhythm for approximately
30 seconds; after which he went back into atrial flutter.
Electrocardioversion was attempted three more times at 300
joules, 300 joules, and 360 joules without success.
Therefore, the patient opted for fibrillation which was
performed with success.  The patient was then continued on
amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d., and diltiazem was stopped.

(b)  Coronary artery disease:  The patient had evidence of
old inferior myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram and
hypokinesis in the inferolateral walls on echocardiogram
consistent with old inferior myocardial infarction.  The
patient was started on aspirin and Lopressor.  The patient
was instructed to follow up as an outpatient and discuss with
is primary care physician the possibility of a stress test
for further workup of his coronary artery disease.

(c)  Anticoagulation:  In the hospital, the patient was
started on heparin and Coumadin at the same time.  INR on the
day of discharge was 1.8.  Therefore, the patient was
discharged on Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously q.d. until his
INR was between 2 and 3; which is therapeutic.

2.  BILATERAL PHLEBITIS:  The patient developed bilateral
phlebitis, and he was treated with Keflex with improvement of
the phlebitis while in the hospital.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. t.i.d. (for four days); then 400
mg p.o. b.i.d. (for one week); then 400 mg p.o. q.d. (for one
week); and then 200 mg p.o. q.d. (for two weeks or until he
sees his Electrophysiology cardiologist).
4.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. (for one month if he remains in
sinus rhythm).
5.  Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously q.d. (until INR is 2 or
higher than that).
6.  Keflex 500 mg p.o. q.i.d. (for five days).

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home with [**Hospital6 3429**] to administer Lovenox injections until INR
is therapeutic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Pericarditis with atrial fibrillation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with his primary care
physician within the next two weeks who was to set him up
with a cardiologist in the [**Location (un) 3320**] area where he lives.
2.  The patient also to follow up with Electrophysiology
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle)
