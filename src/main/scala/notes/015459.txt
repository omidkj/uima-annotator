737.  His chemistry revealed a sodium of 137, potassium 5.7,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 23, BUN and creatinine 9 and 0.9.
Glucose was 62.

He had an EKG which showed no change from his examination in
[**Month (only) 205**] but irregular rhythm.  Chest x-ray showed a mild
pulmonary edema with a right pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the Vascular Surgery
Service and placed on intravenous antibiotics and was preoped
for a bilateral lower extremity debridement of ulcers.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was placed on
antibiotics, Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  He was
given a Fentanyl patch for pain control and was treated with
intravenous fluids.  Nutrition was involved in his care
postoperatively.  He also received a cardiac evaluation and
the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center was involved.  On the [**9-14**], he underwent a right above the knee amputation.  He
tolerated the procedure well.  His blood sugars were
monitored closely throughout his stay.  He was treated
primarily in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and in the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit throughout his stay.

On the [**9-18**], the patient was found to be
increasingly somnolent and it was determined that he was in
respiratory failure with acidosis.  He was intubated at this
time and his vital signs were monitored closely.  It was
thought that he had aspirated during a meal.  He was
transferred from the Vascular Intensive Care Unit to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit at that time.  He was sedated
appropriately with Propofol and a Swan-Ganz catheter was
placed.  He was started on a Dopamine drip.  A Dobhoff
feeding tube was placed and he was initiated on tube feeds.
His Infectious Disease issues were dealt with by the
Infectious Disease Service.  Multiple cultures were obtained
which showed gram negative rods consistent with enterococcus
from his left heel wound along with Pseudomonas.  A lavage
revealed Citrobacter which is resistant to multiple agents
and his right stump revealed a Citrobacter also resistant to
multiple agents along with Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  He was on Meropenem and Vancomycin
for his pneumonia and these agents covered his stump
infection as well.

A Dermatology consultation was also obtained due to a rash
which had been noted for the last few days by the primary
team, that began at his right forearm and appeared
morbilliform in character and non itchy.  Dermatology
recommended Triamcinolone ointment to the arms and
Dermatology Service also followed him throughout the
remainder of his course at the hospital.

The patient had a tracheostomy during his stay; this was done
on [**10-9**] when a percutaneous tracheostomy was placed
due to chronic respiratory failure.  The patient was
discharged to a rehabilitation facility on [**10-11**].  At
that time, he was receiving tube feeds at 85 cc an hour.
Tube feeds were ProMod with fiber.  He had a trache in place.
He was on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl and his
diabetes mellitus was being managed by the [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 982**]
Clinic.  His Lantus was at 26 units and he had a regular
insulin sliding scale as well.
