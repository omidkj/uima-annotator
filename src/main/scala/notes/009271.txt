Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers and Chest Tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 39 year old male who presented with fevers, chest
tightness, and shortness of breath.  Patient began experiencing
fevers and joint aches in late-[**Month (only) **].  He visited the [**Hospital **] clinic
and was placed on a two-week course of Doxycycline, given his
previous history of Lyme Disease.  Patient continued to have
fevers despite his antibiotic treatment.  Serologies were sent
for Lyme and Babesiosis, which were both negative.  In the
beginning of [**Month (only) 216**], the patient began to experience fevers of
102, neck stiffness, and palpitations.  He again visited the [**Hospital **]
clinic, where it was thought that he may be having a reaction to
Doxycycline.  This medication was thus discontinued.  This week,
the patient developed chest tightness and increasing shortness
of breath.  He states that his chest pain is worse  He called
the [**Hospital **] clinic and was told to go immediately to the ED.
.
In the ED, the patient's VS were T 99.8, P 107, BP 137/78, O2
100% on RA.  The patient had a CXR performed, which showed a
markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  An ECHO was then
performed, which showed a large pericardial effusion and
sustained right atrial collapse.  The patient went to the cath
lab, where he had a pericardialcentesis.  Patient's pericardial
pressure was found to be 14.  900 cc of serosanguinous fluid
were successfully removed.  Of note, the post-pericardiocentesis
right-sided pressures remained mildly elevated.  Patient was
then admitted to the CCU for further workup and evaluation.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies cough, diarrhea, rashes, and
lower extremity swelling.  Patient endorses recent nausea and
vomiting.  All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Social History:
Patient finished graduate school in chemistry and left academics
for woodworking.  He does not smoke cigarettes, he drinks
alcohol occasionally, and he does not use illicit drugs.
Patient has not had any recent travel.  He has one dog, a border
collie.  He is frequently in the [**Doctor Last Name 6641**], as he enjoys trail

[**Location 71665**], PA and moved to [**Location (un) 86**] 20 years ago.

*****************
PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:

Cardiac Catheterization [**2179-9-30**]:  COMMENTS:
1.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 17 mm Hg and PCWP mean of 15 mm Hg.
There was
blunting of the x and y descents. There was mild pulmonary
arterial
hypertension of 36/17 mm Hg.  The initial pericardial pressure
was
measured to be 14 mm Hg.  This equalization of pressures is
consistent
with tamponade physiology.  The cardiac index was preserved at
2.4
l/min/m2. 2.  Successful pericardiocentesis was performed with
removal of 900 ml of serosanguinous fluid.
Post-pericardiocentesis, the right sided
pressures remained mildly elevated.  The pericardial pressure
decreased
to 5 mm Hg.

Echo ([**2179-9-30**]):  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a large pericardial effusion. There is sustained right atrial
collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early
tamponade.

Echo ([**2179-10-1**]):  The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is a small pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Echo ([**2179-10-2**]):  Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a small
to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. The effusion is largest adjacent to the basal to mid
inferolateral wall (measures 1.4 cm). Anterior to the right
atrium and distal right ventricular free wall, it measures up to
0.8 cm in diameter. Stranding is visualized within the
pericardial space c/w organization. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2179-10-2**]):  IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate to large pericardial effusion with pericardial
enhancement, a
finding that suggests infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic
cause.
2. Small left and tiny right pleural effusions.  3. Marked
adrenal hyperplasia. The differential diagnosis would include
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and, in the setting of the
associated findings described above, other entities such as
tuberculosis, other granulomatous disease, or rare entities such
as Erdheim- [**Location (un) **] disease.  4. Several tiny calcified
granulomata in the lung bases, consistent with prior
granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis.  5. Tiny hepatic
lesions, too smal
