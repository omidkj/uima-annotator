Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2151-6-29**] - Mitral valve repair (28mm CG Future Annuloplasty Ring)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 23 year old female with known mitral valve prolapse
which was originally diagnosed at the age of 14. She has been
followed closely with serial
echcocardiograms which reveals worsening mitral regurgitation
and now shows evidence of left ventricular dilatation and left
atrial enlargement. Given the above findings, she was referred
for mitral valve repair/replacement. Of note, she recently had a
high-risk pregnancy and delivered without complication. She
currently has IUD which will prevent pregnancy for the next five
years. She is undecided on whether she wants more children but
has elected for a mechanical valve in the event her valve cannot
be repaired.

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-6-29**]
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is in SR, on no infusions.
There is a mitral ring in place with no leak and trace MR.
Residual mean gradient = 3 mmHg.
No AI. Aorta intact.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2151-6-29**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve repair using
an annuloplasty ring. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours, she awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative day
one, she was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight. She was started on lopressor and developed prolonged PR
>.30. The lopressor was discontinued w/ normalization of PR
interval. She was tacycardic in the days following and lopressor
was resumed at a lower dosage which she tolerated. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility. her chest tubes and wires
were removed per protocol. She received 1 unit PRBC for post
anemia with HCT 23 with appropriate response in HCT 24.6. She
was cleared for discharge to home by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
