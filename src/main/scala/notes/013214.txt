[**9-18**] CXR: Kyphosis is evident as before. The heart size and
mediastinal contours are stable. Minimal atelectasis is present
at the right base. The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Resp failure- admitted w/ hypercarbic, hypoxic resp failure.
Although no clear pna was started on abx for possible
contribution.  Additionally was started on steroids for tx of
COPD.  Maintained o/n on bipap.  On HD2, in family wished that
patient be made DNI as well.  Initially tolerated ventimask but
could not maintain relative hypocapnia over the next day and was
placed back on bipap.  Steadily became increasingly unarousable,
likley [**12-28**] CO2 retention.   On HD3, family requested that pt be
made comfort measures only.  Morphine prn started and patient
subsequently passed away later that night.
