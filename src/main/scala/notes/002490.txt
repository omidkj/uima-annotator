Date of Birth:                  Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old female
with past medical history significant for congestive heart
failure, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the CCU with
bradycardia and hypotension status post cardiac
catheterization.

Patient initially presented to [**Hospital6 2018**] for an elective cardiac catheterization.  She was
scheduled for mitral valve replacement and required a
catheterization as part of her preoperative evaluation.
However, during that catheterization procedure patient
decompensated with markedly elevated pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure to the 50s when placed supine.  Patient was
then intubated and got Lasix, a nitroglycerin drip, and beta
blocker.

Her respiratory distress did improve at this point. However,
she then became briefly bradycardiac and hypotensive.  She
was then started on a Dopamine drip, at which point her rate
and pressure both stabilized.  In addition, her wedge
pressure did improve to approximately 20. Patient was then
transferred to the CCU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction.
2.  Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.
3.  Tricuspid regurgitation.
4.  Aortic regurgitation.
5.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Non-small cell lungs cancer status post right upper
lobectomy and mediastinal and lymph node dissection.
8.  Rheumatic heart disease with history of rheumatic fever.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor.
2.  Ibuprofen.
3.  Darvocet.
4.  Lipitor.
5.  Levothyroxine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol or tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac/Coronary:  Patient admitted to the CCU following
cardiac catheterization.  Her catheterization showed
three-vessel coronary disease.  Her left main was heavily
calcified with up to 30% stenosis.  Her left anterior
descending was heavily calcified with 50% proximal and 70%
mid vessel stenoses.  Her left circumflex had a moderate
osteal calcification with diffuse disease to 30% proximally.
Obtuse marginal 1 branch had a 70% stenosis at its origin.
The right coronary artery was calcified and diffusely
diseased to 50% in the mid vessel.

Patient had no active ischemic symptoms on following her
catheterization.  She was maintained on aspirin and statin.
Initially, patient was hypotensive.  However, following
stabilization of her blood pressure, beta blocker was added
on to her medication regimen.  Based on patient's
three-vessel disease she was thought to be a candidate for
coronary artery bypass graft.

Cardiothoracic Surgery service was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding this.
Initially planned to proceed directly to surgery; however,
given patient's complicated medical history, instead she was
discharged with plans for a readmission in the near future
for a CABG.  She is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
for this.

2.  Pump:  Patient with severe ventricular diastolic
dysfunction following cardiac catheterization which did show
severe diastolic dysfunction which was complicated by
significant pulmonary edema.  Patient did require intubation
given her pulmonary edema.  She also developed cardiogenic
shock during the catheterization, likely a combination of her
congestive heart failure decompensation and multiple
medications administered.

Pericatheterization, she received Lasix and beta blocker and
was started on a nitroglycerin drip.  Following this she was
also placed on a Natrecor drip. However, she then developed
hypotension and bradycardia requiring a Dopamine drip for her
cardiogenic shock.  A Swan-Ganz was placed for close
hemodynamic monitoring.

Following transfer to the unit patient was able to be weaned
off the Dopamine drip and her blood pressure stabilized.
There was concern for overdiuresis following her respiratory
decompensation.  Patient actually following discontinuation
of Lasix and Natrecor continued to autodiurese several
liters.  She was gently rehydrated and further diuresis was
avoided.  Her blood pressure was closely managed to avoid any
further cardiac decompensation.

Following stabilization off of pressors, an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta blocker were
added on and titrated up as tolerated.

3.  Patient with history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on
Amiodarone at time of admission:  When patient was first
admitted to the CCU she was in sinus rhythm.  However, given
her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation she was maintained on a
Heparin drip with plans to eventually transition her to
Coumadin.  Patient did go back into atrial fibrillation.  She
was then restarted on her Amiodarone, and her Heparin was
transitioned over to Coumadin.

4.  Valve:  Patient was in severe MR, AI.  Patient is planned
for a mitral valve replacement in the near future.  However,
she first underwent cardiac catheterization as detailed above
for preoperative clearance.  Patient was followed by the
Cardiothoracic Surgery team throughout her hospital stay.

[**Last Name (STitle) 48164**] a history of rheumatic heart disease which was
thought to be the likely etiology for her valvular disease.
Patient was started on the angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor for afterload reduction at time of discharge.  She
is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for mitral valve
replacement.

5.  Respiratory failure:  Patient developed severe pulmonary
edema during her cardiac catheterization requiring
intubation.  Following intubation patient was aggressively
diuresed, which markedly improved her oxygen.  She was
subsequently weaned off the ventilator and easily extubated
without any further complications.

6.  Oncology:  Patient with history of non-small cell lung
cancer and right upper lobe lobectomy.  Patient had no active
oncology issues during this admission.

7.  Hypothyroidism:  Patient maintained on Synthroid as per
her home regimen.  A TSH was checked which showed her to be
euthyroid at this time on an appropriate level of thyroid
hormone replacement.

8.  Urinary tract infection:  On routine urinalysis a urine
culture did grow out Enterococcus.  A urinalysis showed no
evidence of white cells, bacteria, or other infection.
However, given the finding of Enterococcus in her urine it
was decided to treat patient empirically with Cipro as per
the Cardiothoracic Surgery service.  Patient was given a
prescription for Ciprofloxacin for a total of seven days of
treatment.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post cardiac
catheterization showing three-vessel disease.
2.  Diastolic dysfunction.
3.  Severe mitral regurgitation.
4.  Aortic insufficiency.
5.  Hypothyroidism.
6.  Urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 q. day.
2.  Atorvastatin 20 mg q. day.
3.  Levothyroxine 125 mcg q. day.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg q. day.
5.  Lisinopril 10 mg q. day.
6.  Toprol XL 25 mg q. day.
7.  Amiodarone 200 mg b.i.d.
8.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg b.i.d. times seven days.

DI[**Last Name (STitle) 408**]E INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] for plans of mitral valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass graft.  The Cardiothoracic Surgery scheduler is
aware of this and will call the patient at home soon after
discharge to arrange this.
