Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 55 yo F w/COPD, CHF (EF 15%), gout, who presents with
complaints of increase shortness of breath. Of note, the pt was
recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 106165**]/07 for CHF exacerbation felt to
be secondary to medication noncompliance. During her hospital
stay, she was aggressively diuresed with mitolazone and bumex
given that she had minimal effect with lasix (240 mg in one
day). Her wheezing at the time seemed to improve with aggressive
diuresis (not with prednisone or nebs). Since the pts last
discharge, she states she has become progressively more SOB. She
has been compliant with taking all of her medications. She
sleeps sitting up at night, but denies any increased leg
swelling. She has not been monitoring her weights at home. She
denies any wheezing or CP.
.
In the ED, vitals were: Tm 97.7 BP 86-117/63-89 Hr 72-97 Sat
93%RA and 99% 4L. She received Lasix 40 mg IV x1 and SBP dropped
from 108 to 86. Urine output was 1500 cc to the Lasix 40 mg
IVx1.


Past Medical History:
-asthma (FEV1/FVC 83%)
-CHF (EF 15-20%): TTE [**2121-3-17**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP> 18mmHg).
Tissue synchronization imaging demonstrates significant left
ventricular dyssynchrony with the lateral wall contracting 75 ms
later than the septum. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of breath: In the ED initially felt to be due to CHF
so she was given 40mg of IV lasix to which she put out 1500ml of
urine.  This provided minimal improvement in her breathing.
Thus it was felt that her DOE and SOB was likely multifactorial
and related to obesity, pulm HTN/OSA, anxiety. And there was low
suspicion for frank CHF exacerbation given fairly benign lung
exam, metabolic alkalosis, hemoconcentration, and high BUN/Cr
ratio.  She was given ativan for anxiety and respiratory status
stabilized.  we restarted her bumex at 2mg qday given concern
for overdiuresis on 4mg.
.
# Pump: As per above, the pt has h/o CHF with biventricular
dilated CM, EF 15%. Pt seems intravascularly dry based on BUN/Cr
ratio, metabolic alkalosis, and exam.  Initially held ACEI given
transient hypotension in setting of diuresis.  Then restarted
ACEI and bumex at 2mg qday and held aldactone. Continued on
digoxin and carvedilol.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to both ACE and aldactone.
restarted ACEI and  held aldactone; was given kayaxelate with
appropriate response.
.
# elevated blood sugars: continue on ISS and start on metformin
.
# Metabolic Alkalosis: Likely secondary to overdiuresis.
.
# Elevated Hct: Pts hct is 52, with BL of 40. Suspect
hemoconcentration.
.
# Gout: continue allopurinol
.
# FEN: cardiac healthy/low sodium, lytes replete, diuresis as
above
.
# Prophylaxis: Heparin sc, colace, PPI
.
# Access: PIV
.
# Code: Full

Dispo: patient was discharged to rehab due to physical therapy
requirements from her CHF and gout.
