History of Present Illness:
87 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic
stenosis, aortic regurgitation and hypertension. She has had
several recent admissions ([**Hospital 8641**] Hospital) for congestive heart
failure, most recently today. She is scheduled for surgery with
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**1-10**] and is now being transferred in the hope that
surgical date can be moved to an earlier time slot. According to
Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] note dated [**2172-4-29**], the patient was found to have
aortic stenosis by echocardiogram after detection of a murmur on
physical examination. At that time she experienced some
tolerable, but occasional exertional dyspnea and
mild lower extremity edema. Over the last month, she admits to
worsening dyspnea on exertion. Recent evaluation revealed
multivessel coronary disease and significant mitral
regurgitation. She is now referred for surgical evaluation.

variably split S2, no S3, and no S4.  There is a prominent
systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border with
radiation to the upper right sternal border and a prominent
apical holosystolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla.
There is no click or rub.  The left ventricular impulse is
nondisplaced.
ABDOMEN:  Benign, without masses, tenderness, organomegaly,
bruits, abdominojugular reflux, or fluid wave.  The bowel sounds
are normal.
EXTREMITIES:  There is trace pedal edema.  There is no cyanosis
or clubbing. There is good capillary refill.
NEUROLOGIC:  The patient is awake, alert, fully oriented, and
fluently conversant.  There are no focal neurologic
abnormalities.


Pertinent Results:
Carotid Ultrasound [**2173-12-29**]
Impression:
Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.

Of note although symmetric both carotid waveforms are tardus
which may reflect arch or more proximal disease. Clinical
correlation is warranted

[**2173-12-31**] ECHO
Prebypass
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global
hypokinesis and moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferior,
inferolateral, anteroseptal, inferoseptal walls. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
25%).
The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Postbypass
The patient is being AV paced.
The patient is on epinephrine and phenylephrine infusions.
The cardiac index is 1.6L/min/m2.
There is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position, with peak/mean gradient 8/4mmHg.
There is moderate MR.
The visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.
The biventricular systolic function is similar to prebyss exam.
The thoracic aortic contour is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-12-28**] for further
management of her heart failure. Diuresis was initiated with
good result. Heparin was started as a bridge to surgery as her
coumadin had been stopped. She was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which
showed a less then 40% stenosis of the bilateral internal
carotid arteries. On [**2173-12-31**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement
and coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see
operative note for details. Post-operatively she was transferred
to the intensive care unit for monitoring.  Initially the
patient required support with milrinone, levophed and
epinephrine leaving the OR.  Inotropic and vasopressor support
was weaned as the patient stabilized.  The patient was extubated
on POD 3.  Pneumothorax was noted on CXR and the patient
received a chest tube at the bedside on [**2174-1-3**].
Thrombocytopenia developed with platelet count dropping to
53,000.  HIT would return negative.  Platelet count rose
appropriately.  It was 125,000 on discharge.  Beta blockade and
diuresis were initiated.  The patient transferred to the step
down unit.  Coumadin was resumed for atrial fibrillation.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD 6, the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to [**Hospital 82652**] Rehab in [**Location (un) 3844**] in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
