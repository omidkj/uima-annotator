[**2143-12-4**] sigmoidoscopy report
Erythema, ulceration and friability in the distal sigmoid colon
extending through out the proximal descending colon compatible
with ischemic colitis
The rectal mucosa was normal, there was no evidence of
ulcerations or bleeding.

RENAL U.S. PORT  [**2143-12-5**] 10:46 AM
1. Markedly abnormal blood flow to the right kidney. This raises
concern for renal artery thrombosis.
2) Normal flow to the left kidney.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-12-14**] 8:39 PM
1. Interval development of mild-to-moderate pleural effusions
and small ascites. The free fluid within the pelvis is slightly
dense which may represent a component of blood likely related to
recent procedure. Cannot rule out acute extravasation due to
lack of IV contrast.
2. Bilateral tiny nonobstructive renal stones.
3. Dilated CBD with a 9-mm hyperdense focus within the lumen
that could represent a stone. Ultrasound is recommended for
further characterization.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2143-12-15**] 9:30 AM
1. Exam is still limited by small amount of oral contrast and
lack of progression distally. There is still suggestion of wall
edema involving the sigmoid colon with remaining intrapelvic
bowel appearing unremarkable. No evidence of free air or
pneumatosis.
2. Unchanged choledocholithiasis better appreciated on recent
ultrasound. Unchanged renal calculi.
3. Stable bilateral simple pleural effusions and adjacent
compression atelectasis. Unchanged mild-to-moderate amount of
slightly hyperdense free fluid within the abdominal and pelvic
cavity. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
4. Unchanged caliber of sub 4-cm abdominal aortic aneurysm
status post repair.

US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE ORGAN  [**2143-12-15**] 9:39 AM
Choledocholithiasis with probable cholelithiasis and findings
suggestive of acute vs chronic cholecystitis.
Please note in retrospect CBD stone/dilatation appears to have
been present on [**Month (only) 359**] CT

[**2143-12-18**] ERCP
Evidence of a previous gastrojujenostomy was seen.
The scope was passed through both anastomotic limbs but could
not reach the papilla due to either long limb B II or Roux-en-Y
anatomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2143-12-3**] AAA resection, transfered to PACU intubated and
sedated.
[**2143-12-4**] POD#1 remained sedated and intubated. episode of
hypotension requiring fluid resustation and dobutamine. HCT 33.5
episode of bright red rectal bleeding. Followed by acute pain
service for epidural. patient oliguric and acidotic. GI
consulted for bloody stools. Sigmoidoscopy performed: Ischemic
colitis of sigmid colon extending to proximal descending colon.
General surgery consulted and recommended conserative managment
and serial exams.
[**2143-12-5**] POD#2 oligutia continued with climbing creatinine.
Renal consulted for CVVH. Thrombocytopenia- HIT sent.(negative)
[**2143-12-6**] POD#3 remained intubated. continued IV zosyn. continued
epidural.
New radial line placed. Lasix began. CVL changed.
[**2143-12-7**] POD#4 minimal response to lasix. CVVH and TPN started,
epidural cath discontinued.
[**2143-12-8**] POD#5 remained in ICU care.
[**2143-12-9**] POD#6 status slowly improved, now on pressure support.
[**2143-12-10**] POD#7 continued CVVH, swan [**Last Name (un) **] catheter converted to
CVL. Zosyn discontinued.
[**2143-12-11**] POD#8 insulin gtt for hyperglycemia. CVVH discontinued.
Hemodialysis instituted.
[**2143-12-12**] POD#9 hemodialyis short run secondary to hypotension.
transfuse for HCT of 24 post transfusion Hct.28 CVVH restarted.
[**2143-12-14**] POD#11 extubated. transfused for Hct 26. hemodialyis
trial
[**2143-12-15**] POD#12 Zosyn restartred for persistant elevated WBC and
CT findings of " fluid in the pelvis"
[**2143-12-16**] POD#13 a-line discontinued. TPN continued. clear sips
started for ERCP [**2143-12-17**].POD#14 Transfered to VICU. U/S
performed that demonstrated RUQ common bile duct diltation.
[**2143-12-18**] POD#15 attempted ERCP, unable to reach ampulla due to
previous subtotal gastrectomy
[**2143-12-19**] POD#16 tunneled right IJ line placed by transplant for
HD. TPN d/c'd, diet advanced. LFT's improving.
[**2143-12-21**] POD#18 HD performed
[**2143-12-22**] POD#19 abdominal incision staples d/c'ed
[**2143-12-24**] POD#21 Pt's creatinine plateau'ed. Pt again dialyzed.
Per nephrology, it appears that the patient will not need
hemodialysis for an extended period of time. Zosyn d/c'ed, left
triple lumen catheter d/c'ed. Pt d/c'ed from [**Hospital1 18**] to [**Hospital 29158**] rehab.
