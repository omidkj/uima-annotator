Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 71 y.o female with h.o COPD (FEV1 .5L/35%), h.o
diastolic dysfunction, GERD who presents with recurrent dyspnea
after discharge from OSH for COPD exacerbation yesterday.
.
#Dyspnea/hypoxia:  Patient has a history of COPD, with FEV1 35%.
She was recently admitted and discharged earlier today from
[**Hospital3 **] with COPD exacerbation. It was unclear exactly
what propmted her respiratory decompensation and re-admission
shortly after discharge.  (The patient denied having run out of
O2 or her medications at home.) Potential etiologies included
persistent COPD exacerbation, URI/PNA, or volume overload. Other
possible etiologies include PE, however no tachycardia/EKG
changes, or [**Name (NI) 93044**] pt w/o CP/palp, so these were thought
less likely.  She initially required Bipap and was thus admitted
to the ICU.
.
In the ICU, given the possibility of volume overload (elevated
BNP, and echo with evidence of diastoic dysfunction) she was
diuresed ~2L. For her COPD, she was given a dose of solumedrol
followed by prednisone 30 mg daily and azithromycin.  She was
also given round-the-clock nebulizer treatments.  Her O2 Sats
were excellent on this regimen, although ABG did reveal
significant CO2 retention. She was persistently afebrile. She
was transferred from the ICU to the general medicine floor.
.
On the general medicine floor, her outpatient COPD regimen with
the exception of theophylline was restarted (see below).
Prednisone was continued at an increased dose of 30 mg daily.
Her O2 Sats were 92-95% on 2L NC, which is apparently her
baseline.  Her volume status was continually evaluated. Given
her metabolic alkalosis (which was beyond the compensatory
amount expected for her chronic respiratory acidosis) and her
physical examination, she was almost certainly dry.  She
remained net foluid even to slightly negative daily without
diuretics.  Her home O2 company was contact[**Name (NI) **] and verified that
her equipment was working properly at home prior to discharge.
She is discharged with another 2 week taper of prednisone back
to the 10 mg daily she is on at baseline and an appointment with
her pulmonologist later this month to guide further treatment.
Calcium and vitamin D were started given prolonged steroid use.
.
#Leukocytosis:  This was likely secondary to steroid use.  She
was afebrile, without cough, dysuria, fever/chills. Blood and
urine cultures were persistantly negative.
.
#Nausea/LFT abnormalities:  She intermittently complained of
nausea and had an episode of vomitting.  This was thought to be
possibly due to theophylline, which was stopped.  Concominantly,
she developed slight right upper quadrant pain and a mild
transaminitis of unclear etiology.  RUQ ultrasound showed only
fatty infiltration of the liver.  Nausea improved, and LFTs
trending down near the normal range.
.
#GERD:  PPI was increased to [**Hospital1 **] to help with potential reflux
contribution to reactive airway disease, as recommended in a
recent note from her pulmonologist.
.
#Diabetes:  Metformin was held initially given the recent
contrast study at an outside hospital.  She was covered with
sliding scale insulin.  Fingersticks were frequently elevated as
high as 500 in the context of high-dose prednisone (30 mg).
Metformin was restarted, with improvement in glucose control.
The day of discharge, she was still having values as high as
300.  She was encouraged to check her fingersticks twice daily
and to call her PCP for values >400.  Follow up was arranged
with PCP for further titration of her diabetes regimen as the
steroids are tapered.
.
#Hypertension:  The patient did not carry a prior diagnosis of
hypertension, but systolic BPs were in the 180s (in the context
of 30 mg prednisone).  Lisinopril was started and uptitrated to
10 mg daily, with SBP falling into the 140-150 range.
.
.
The patient initially stated a desire to be DNR/DNI, but later
conveyed clearly that she wished to be FULL CODE.
