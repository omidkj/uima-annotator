History of Present Illness:
85yo M w/hx of Crohn's disease, CAD, COPD, CHF (EF 50%), afib,
recent PNA who initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**5-6**] with right hip
fracture and likely bilateral PNA.  He was started on

.
CXR [**2158-5-6**]: dense nodular material at LL base stable in
appearance, increased opacification at bilateral lung bases may
represent atelectasis or consolidation. Mild increase opacity at
RL base adjacent to cardiac silloute.
.
Hip X-ray [**2158-5-6**]: Comminuted, intertrochanteric fx of R hip.
Femoral head in acetabulum with superiorly displaced femur.

EKG ON MICU ADMIT: Afib w RVR 120s, NA, NI, Q V1
.
CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Subsegmental right lower and upper lobe pulmonary emboli. No
evidence of
aortic dissection.
2. Bilateral left greater than right lower lobe pneumonias with
collapse of the left lower lobe and secretions within the left
lower lobe bronchi.
Small-to-moderate bilateral reactive effusions with bilateral
subpulmonic
components.
3. Markedly dilated right atrium with underlying right heart
dysfunction.
Dilated main pulmonary artery likely from pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and
coronary
circulation.
5. Cholelithiasis with no secondary findings of acute
cholecystitis. Trace
abdominal ascites.
.
ECHO:
The right atrium is markedly dilated. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle
with evidence of pressure/volume overload and at least moderate
pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
The left ventricle is small (probably due to the effect of the
large RV), with hyperdynamic function and mild mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2154-8-28**],
the image quality is better on the current study. The RV may be
slightly more dilated. The degree of pulmonary hypertension is
similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
85yo M w/hx of CAD, systolic CHF, afib, recent PNA, and recent
right hip fracture presents to MICU with altered ms, afib with
RVR, and hypoxic respiratory failure.  Now with tenuous
hemodynamics s/p intubation.
.
# Shock: Patient had systolic blood pressures in the 90s in
setting of afib w RVR then hypotensive s/p intubation.
Initially the cause of shock was unknown likely a combination of
cardiogenic, septic, and possibly obstructive shock.  A CTA
showed small PE's and bilateral lower lobe pneumonias.  He was
started on neosyneprhine which was changed to levaphed for
elevating lactate.  He failed to wean from the vent and his
pressor requirement elevated to the point that he was on maximal
doses of Levaphed, Neosynephrine, and Vasopressin.  He continued
to be hypotensive to 70s/40s with HR gradually rising to the
140s overnight.  His family was updated on the gravity of his
situation and made the decision to focus on comfort.  He was
made CMO, life support was withdrawn, and he passed quickly on
[**2158-5-8**].
.
# Hypoxic resp failure: Mr. [**Known lastname 5762**] was transfered to the ICU
after hypoxic event.  He had evidence of bilat infiltrates on
CXR and recent PNA treated with levaquin.  Reportedly flu
negative at rehab.  He had a CTA chest which showed small PEs
and bilateral lower lobe PNAs.  He was unable to wean from the
vent given his increasing pressor requirements.
.
# Cards rhythm: afib w RVR known in his past.  Generally well
rate controlled.  As above, his pressor requirement increased
and his H
