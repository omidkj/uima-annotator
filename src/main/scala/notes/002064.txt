Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7760**]
Chief Complaint:
76 year old female admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with abdominal distention
and pain consistent with large and small bowel obstruction,
treated with NG tube and IV TPN x 10 days without relief,
confirmed today by CT scan - preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] looks
same or worse than 2 mo ago; pt had improved in interim and is
now worse.  Previous colonoscopies showed increasing obstruction
in sigmoid area, ? due to diverticulitis but patient now has
confirmed lung cancer by biopsy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P Loop transverse colostomy on [**2125-10-17**]

History of Present Illness:
Patient has history of small bowel obstructions and recently a
10 day history of abdominal pain and bloating,treated at
[**Hospital1 **] with decompression with nasogastric tube and total
parenteral nutrition. Symptoms have continued. Admitted to [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**2125-10-12**] for further work up of lung cancer and definitive
treatment of her bowel obstruction. CT of abdomen shows
dilatation of large and small bowel with an area of change of
caliber at the junction of the descending colon and sigmoid. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] has spoken extensively with patient and family and they
have decided to proceed to surgery.

On [**2125-10-17**] transverse loop colostomy performed.

Chest x-ray - Single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2125-10-13**]
at 09:00 and compared with the prior evening's radiograph
performed at 17:40. Right upper lobe opacity is little less
apparent than on the prior examination. Remainder of the
appearances of the lung fields are essentially unchanged with no
acute process identified. Tubes and lines are unchanged. Mild
distension of visualized colon. No evidence of free
intraperitoneal air.

Cat Scan - CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases
demonstrate two noncalcified lung nodules in the right middle
lobe measuring 9 mm and right lower lobe measuring 4 mm (S2,
I1). Atelectatic changes in the dependent portions are noted.
The previously described mass in the right upper lobe is
excluded in this study. There is no pleural effusion. Coronary
artery calcifications. Heart is normal in size. The liver is
diffusely hypodense consistent with fatty infiltration. The
patient is status post cholecystectomy. There is no intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The spleen, adrenal
glands, and pancreas are unremarkable. The kidneys appear
grossly unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis. Small
mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted, not
pathologically enlarged by CT criteria. Persistent diffuse
dilatation of large and small bowel with an area of change of
caliber at the junction of the descending colon and sigmoid.
When compared to the prior study, the degree of dilatation
appears slightly worse. There is no free air or free fluid
within the abdomen. An NGT is noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 year old female admitted with persistent abdominal
pain and bloating from [**Hospital **] Rehab. By CT - shows stricture
in the sigmoid region as well as an upper R lung mass. On
[**2125-10-17**] patient underwent a tranverse loop colostomy for small
bowel obstruction. Postoperative course complicated by
tachycardia, respiratory failure, nonoperative lung mass,
urinary tract infection, several admissions to ICU for
tachycardia and respiratory difficulty.

Cardiology Consult - Postoperatively patient had several periods
where she became tachycardic 130's she remained tachycardic
after fluid resuscitation and no longer febrile. They continue
to feel that her tachycardia is related to fluid shifts and
normal physiologic response.

Geriatric Consult - Patient is somewhat angry regarding
diagnosis and need for colostomy. Geriatric service was helpful
prior to patient's surgery in helping her through her anger.

Social Work - Patient has been followed throughout hospital
course. Working with patient and family.

Thoracics Consult - nonoperative lung mass, small cell lung
cancer to be followed up with radiation/oncologist - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for radiation treatments.

Problems
1. Respiratory - Saddle PE/sm. cell lung cancer/CHF/Asthma -
postoperative course as above. Current respiratory status -
Bilateral breath sounds clear with few exp. wheeze and fine
crax. in R base. For last 4 days patient has been running
95-100% oxygen saturations.

2. Cardiac - tachycardia/hypertension - postoperative course as
above. Echo [**2125-10-24**] normal RV size amd free wall motion. LVEF
45-50%, septal hypokinesis, No asd/vsd seen. Mild pulmonary
artery hypertension. No effusion. Currently patient remains
tachycardic 100-120. Blood pressures ranging 100-140 systolic.
Remains on lopressor 25mg [**Hospital1 **].

3. Anticoagulation - Currently patient on coumadin 5mg po daily
and fondaparinux sc. INR today [**10-31**] = 1.7. Fondaparinux should
be discontinued when INR [**2-10**]. Then titrate coumadin to maintain.

4. Infectious Disease - MRSA - via nasal swab, VRE - via rectal
swab

5. Malnutrition - Currently patient on soft diet with cycled
TPN. Needs much encouragement with PO intake.

6. Fluid Shifts - Patient continues to have a large amount of
ostomy output. Will need strict monitoring of intake and output
to ensure balance.

7. Follow up - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6633**] (surgeon) in one week.
               Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]  (radiation oncologist) for radiation
therapy for lung ca.
               Will fax this discharge summary to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
