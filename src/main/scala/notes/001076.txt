Tissue Valve

History of Present Illness:
64 y/o male with symptoms of fatigue who had episode of
congestive heart failure last year which prompted echocardiogram
and cardiac cath. Studies revealed three vessel coronary artery
disease along with severe mitral regurgitation. Referred for
surgery.

Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Gen: 64 y/o male in NAD
Skin: W/D intact
HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: Supple, FROM -JVD, -Carotid bruit
Chest: CTAB -w/r/r
Heart: RRR 2/6 systolic murmur
Abd: Soft, NT/ND +BS
Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, -varicosities
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE, non-focal

Pertinent Results:
[**4-7**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium and right atrium are
normal in cavity size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] 3. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, posterior
directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A1, A2
severe prolapse is seen. No obvious chordal rupture or flail
noted. Mitral Annulus is not dilated. POST-BYPASS: For the
post-bypass study, the patient was receiving vasoactive
infusions including phenylephrine and is being A paced. 1. A
bioprosthesis is well seated in the Mitral position. Leaflets
open well. No MR is seen. Mean gradient across the valve is 5 mm
of Hg with a CO of 4.5 l/min. Although one of the mitral struts
appears to encroach the LVOT, peak gradient across the LVOT and
AV is less than 15 mm of Hg. 2. LV Anterior wall appears
slightly hypokinetic. RV function is preserved. 3. Aorta is
intact post decannulation. 4. IVC-RA junction appears intact, no
turbulence noted on CFD. (intrapericardial IVC repair done)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23219**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**4-5**] he was brought
to the operating room where he underwent a coronary artery
bypass graft x 3 and mitral valve replacement. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. Later on this day he was transferred
to the telemetry floor for further care. On post-op day two his
chest tubes were removed. He continued to improve
post-operatively and worked with physical therapy for strength
and mobility. He was continued to be diuresised and was weaned
from oxygen.  On post-op day 5 he was discharged home with VNA
services and the appropriate medications and follow-up
appointments.
