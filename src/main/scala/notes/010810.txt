History of Present Illness:
88 y/o Russian male with Alzheimer's dementia, remote latent TB
treated w/rifampin and pyrazadine in [**2153**], AF on coumadin, HTN
sent in from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for dyspnea, fever, and hypoxia. On
the day prior to presentation ([**2161-5-15**]) he was noted to be tired
and weak, and he fell. He has not complained of respiratory
symtpoms. Overnight at 0100 he dropped to below 90% and placed
on 2LNC. He had respiratory distress, was given nebulizer and
tylenol without improvement. Later, his O2 sat dropped to 70 on
2L, and he was switched to NRB with 15L, then 96%. Temp was
99.6, given albuterol, but respirations increased to 37. Two
other people were ruled out for flu on the floor. Urine
legionella is pending.
.
In the ED, initial VS - 101, 125 (AF), 148/70, 32, 94% 15L NRB.
Exam notable for tachypnea, 94% on NRB, diffuse rhonchi. Labs
notable for lactate 5.8, Cr 1.1, bicarb 19, wbc 10.3 (29%
bands), INR 2.2. Bcx pending. CXR showing right sided pneumonia.
EKG showing ST 125, LAD, first degree AV delay, no ischemic
changes. Patient was given vancomycin, zosyn, combivent x 3,
tylenol. Only received 1L IVF. His vitals on transfer - 96 on
10L, RR 27, and his access was 1 PIV.
.
On the unit, he was tachypneic, but appeared comfortable and
denied any symptoms. He had a few episodes of relative
hypotension to the 80s-90s systolic. His oxygenation improved to
low-mid 90s on 5L. His lactate rose to 9. He was given 2L of LR
and his lactate trended down to 6. A second IV was placed and he
was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 year-old Russian-speaking M with Dementia, suspected COPD,
AFib on Coumadin, HTN who presented with dyspnea, hypoxia, and
fever, s/p MICU course for treatment of respiratory failure and
septic shock likely secondary to healthcare-associate pneumonia,
transferred to the Medicine floor for continued management,
which was complicated by delerium and subsequent uretheral
injury from self-discontinuation of foley placement. Also found
to have VRE bacteremia for which he was started on 14 days of
Linezolid.
.
# Acute respiratory distress/Healthcare Associated Pneumonia:
Presentation with dyspnea, fever, bandemia, hypoxia, and CXR
findings all consistent with acute pneumonia. Given his
residence at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, he was started on Vancomycin,
Cefepime, and Levofloxacin. TB felt unlikely given the rapid
acuity of symptoms and lack of other more subacute
constitutional symptoms. Moreover, patient had documented
adequate treatment of latent TB (with negative CXR) in [**2153**].
Additional processes, such as pulmonary embolism, seemed
unlikely given his therapeutic INR. Patient was treated with
Bipap and appeared to improve, but on hospital day #2, he was
tachypneic to the 30s, somnolent and working very hard to breath
so he was intubated and placed on ARDS net ventilation. Once
stable he was 12L positive and diuresis with IV Lasix was
initiated. He responded well to Lasix 20mg IV and was extubated
on [**5-19**] without complication. Diuresis was continued until his
volume status was optimized. An echocardiogram showed normal
systolic function. He completed a 7 day course of broad
antibiotics.
.
# Severe sepsis: Patient presented with pneumosepsis and
elevated lactate up to 9.  His lactate trended down to 2 after
6L IVF in the ED.  His pressures maintained MAP >60 until the
patient was intubated when he became hypotensive.  A central
line was placed and he was started on Levophed. He was given
bolus fluids for CVP <10 and weaned off pressors. He was put on
Vanc/Levo/Cef for presumed HAP. He did have BCx positive for
GPCs after resolution of sepsis, which were ultimately speciated
to VRE (Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus). His central venous
catheter was removed. He was started on a 14 days course of PO
Linezolid 600 mg twice daily, which should continue until
[**2161-6-3**]. Surveillence blood cultures have shown no growth to
date. These are still pending and should be followed up on.
.
# Delerium: Likely secondary to toxic/metabolic encephalopathy
from infection in a patient with underlying dementia. We
attempted to minimize unecessary lines and tubes, provide
frequent orientation, and avoid aggravating
medications/sedatives.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled without medications. On
Coumadin for anticoagulation. His INR was elevated at 3 (likely
secondary to antibiotics and poor nutrition), so Coumadin has
been held at discharge. His INR should
