Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
 80yoM with h/o CAD s/p 3v CABG [**2116**] who presented with
hematemesis, syncope, and guiaic positive stool. Patient was in
his usual state of health, until developing some mid-epigastric
pain. He said he began to feel dizzy and as his wife was calling
the ambulance he past out in the bathroom (did not hit his
head). In the ambulance on the way to [**Hospital3 46817**], the patient said he vomited bright red blood. Per
chart review, on arrival to OSH ED T 97.6 HR 88 BP 138/76 RR 18
99%RA. He again vomited bright red blood and passed a formed
guiaic positive stool. Hct was 32. TWI were noted on ECG in the
inferolateral leads. Cardiac enzymes were negative. He was
transfused one unit PRBC and stated on an octreotide gtt, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED T
98.1 HR 85 BP 128/76 R 18 94%RA. NG lavage was positive for
bright red blood, and the NG tube left in place. He was
evaluated by GI who planned to perform EGD once second set of
cardiac enzymes were negative.
.
Briefly, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU and had an
EGD that revealed a large ulcer just above GE junction in the
esophagus, he had a vessel cauterized. He was aggressively
hydrated, given PPI, transfused a total of 3 units (to maintain
his hct > 28), had some of his medications held (ASA, plavix,
labetalol and felodipine). His syncope was thought to be due to
his GIB, but he was ruled out for MI.
.
On transfer to floor, pt. denies cp, sob, dizziness, weakness,
palpitations, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. The patient says
he is feeling well and has no current complaint.

Pertinent results:
CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process
.
Head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Arachnoid cyst of the right middle cranial fossa measuring
4.5 cm in its greatest diameter.
.
Abd xray: IMPRESSION:
1. No free intraabdominal air.
2. Left pleural calcification.
3. Promient appearance of the bladder with surrounding lucency
may be technical. However, CT of the pelvis is suggested for
further evaluation
.
CT pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for bladder pathology.
2. Enlarged prostate and sigmoid diverticulosis.
.
EGD: EGD-large ulcer just above GE junction in the esophagus
.
EChO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 80 yoM with h/o CAD presenting with hematemesis and
syncope, found to have a bleeding esophageal ulcer which
required cauterization.
.
1) Upper GI Bleed: Patient was admitted on aspirin and plavix,
and per EGD found to have an ulcer that had a vessel which was
cauterized.  He was followed by medicine and GI, and for
protection continued on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI (pantoprazole).  His
hematocrit was followed, and he was transfused red cells to
maintain his a hematocrit above 28.  At discharge his hematocrit
was stable, and his hemodynamics were stable as well.  Per GI,
he should have his ASA and plavix held for life, but with his
history of CAD restarting ASA 81mg can be considered at 1 week
post discharge, and restarting plavix not only for status post
CABG but for carotid stenosis, can be decided by his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Name (NI) 46818**] in [**Hospital3 4298**]. Hematocrit should be rechecked
soon after discharge.
.
2) Syncope: The patient's syncope on admission was attributed to
hypovolemia, secondary to his upper GI bleed. Other work-up was
pursued, and he did not exhibit signs of arrythmia on telemetry,
was ruled out for an MI, and his ECHO lacked significant
valvular pathology.  The patient has known carotid stenosis,
that should be further addressed as an outpatient.  On
discharge, the patient was stable and without symptoms of
pre-syncope.
.
3) Coronary artery disease: The patient has a known history of
CAD, and was ruled out for an MI.  He had no symptoms during his
course and was continued on atorvastatin, and labetolol.  As
above, because of his risk for bleed, his aspirin and Plavix,
were held. Risk/benefit needs to be considered with restarting
anti-platelet therapy.
.
4) Hypertension: As the patient presented with a GI bleed, his
anti-hypertensives were initially held.  Once he was
hemodynamically stable, his labetolol was titrated up to
pre-admission doses.  His felodipine and lasix were held, as he
was normotensive, and restarting these should be done as an
outpatient.
.
5) Hypercholesterolemia: Stable with atorvastatin.
