Admission LE US:
[**Last Name (un) **] DVT

CXR [**2145-1-23**]:
FINDINGS: There are low lung volumes, which accentuate
cardiomegaly.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise unremarkable.
Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Lungs are clear, without
consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Degenerative
changes involving the left shoulder is noted.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

Admission ECG;
ST at 116 bpm without acute changes.
Subsequent ECGs: atrial fibrillation

CT [**2145-1-24**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intrathoracic process. Small bibasilar opacities,
left greater
than right, likely atelectasis.
2. Coronary and valvular calcifications.
3. Stable pulmonary nodules measuring less than 4 mm.
4. Unchanged pulmonary arterial enlargement may reflect
underlying pulmonary hypertension.

ECHO [**2145-1-26**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Premature contrast is not
seen in the left heart after intravenous injection of saline
(suboptimal views). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal technical quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved globabl systolic
function. No definite evidence for intracardiac shunt
identified. Trace aortic regurgitation.
