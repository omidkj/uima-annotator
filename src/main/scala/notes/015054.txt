Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Left heel ulceration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2167-12-22**]
Left femoral and external iliac endarterectomy
and bovine pericardial patch angioplasty, left external iliac
artery stent placement; left superficial femoral artery (SFA)
angioplasty; left SFA stent; left lower extremity
arteriogram; exploration of left anterior tibial artery


History of Present Illness:
This is a 66-year-old woman with a gangrenous ulcer of the left
heel and diffuse disease of the left lower extremity arterial
system. Attempts had been made at percutaneous intervention but
the SFA occlusion was not able to be cannulated. She also had
bulky plaque within the common femoral artery and a diffusely
diseased SFA.  She had anterior tibial runoff with a mild to
moderate stenosis in the proximal anterior tibial artery. The
patient had previously undergone a right femoral endarterectomy
and patch angioplasty for severe ischemic rest pain and a
gangrenous ulcer of the right foot. The patient has diffuse
cardiac disease and had severe hypotension at the completion of
that
procedure necessitating chest compressions and epinephrine bolus
and epinephrine drip. Because of the severity of the patient's
disease and the severity of the cardiac disease, the extreme
risk of the procedure, all of which made her procedure exceed
the abilities of the available residents, I
requested a vascular surgery attending as co-surgeon to speed
the process and minimize the duration of anesthetic, maximize
the chance for successful revascularization. We chose
revascularization over amputation as we felt this would have
similar risks as well as the patient's strong desire to maintain
limb salvage.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2167-12-24**]):

MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN
AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**12-21**]: Pt admitted for ischemic pain and heel ulcers, Renal
consult for HD, IV antibiotics for heel ulcers. Heparin drip for
ischemia

[**12-22**]: Left femoral and external iliac endarterectomy and bovine
pericardial patch angioplasty, left external iliac artery stent
placement; left superficial femoral artery (SFA) angioplasty;
left SFA stent; left lower extremity arteriogram; exploration of
left anterior tibial artery.  AT not suitable for bypass -
unclampable and too calcified for suturing.  therefore we
proceeded with femoral endarterectomy an dSFA PTA/stenting.
Given her hypotension at the time of her prior procedure that
was worsened with neo we used epinepherine at completion of this
procedure with good results.  She was kept on a low dose
epinepherine drip and taken to the pacu then icu on epi drip.

Had HD, epo at HD for anemia, cont cellcept for
immunosuppression.

[**12-23**]: Pt on epi for BP control, weaned over night. Diet
advanced. Pt also showed some fluid overload. Diastolic CHF
acute on chronic. Required 02.

Coumadin started. INR followed.

[**12-24**]: Had HD, epo at HD for anemia, cont cellcept for
immunosuppression. Hypotension resolved.  Podiatry Consulted for
heel. Foot film, betadine dressing changes. Pt put on home meds.
PT consult.

FXR: There is irregularity of the bases of the fourth and fifth
metatarsals and early osteomyelitis cannot be completely
excluded.

[**12-25**]: O2 weaned

[**12-26**]: Had HD, epo at HD for anemia. Pt hypertensive.
Antihypertensives titrated up.

Neurology consulted for [**Month/Year (2) **] leg weakness.

Clinical neuro examination tonight is limited secondary to LE
wounds, pain in LE but she can give split second maximum effort
in L IP nonetheless. DTRs are hypoactive symmetrically. There is
decrease vibration sense distally, c/w sensory polyneuropathy.
PT encouraged. Nothing more to do.

[**12-27**]: pt stable, continued PT, case management cosulted.
Transfered to VICU.

[**12-28**]: Had HD, epo at HD for anemia. Pt still hypertensive. On
clonidine, hydralazine, coreg. Pt transfered to floor. Case
management consulted for rehab.

[**12-29**] - [**1-1**] [**Hospital 25403**] rehab, Coumadin, Antihypertensives, HD, Vanco
for heel.  Serous drainage from groin wound - no erythema or
purulence.

Pt gets rehab bed
