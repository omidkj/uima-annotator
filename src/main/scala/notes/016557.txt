Admission Date:  [**2191-5-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2191-6-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2134-10-4**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU/[**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

ADDENDUM:  1.  ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:  Complicated by sepsis
and ARDS.  The patient did well once he left the MICU.  He
continued to have crackles on examination and aspiration for
several days.  He did not have any additional difficulties
with his breathing.

2.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient remained hypertensive during
much of his hospital stay.  The patient's Clonidine patch was
maintained and his metoprolol and ACE inhibitor doses were
increased.  His blood pressure was under better control prior
to his discharge.

3.  LINE INFECTION:  The patient was transferred to the MICU
with left internal jugular line in place.  This line was
maintained for several days until he spiked a temperature.
At that time, the line was discontinued and the site was
noted to be erythematous with a small amount of pus.  Blood
cultures were positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus
aureus.  He was placed on vancomycin and will complete a
seven day course.

4.  NUTRITION:  The patient came from the MICU with a NG tube
in place.  He underwent repeat swallow evaluation which
demonstrated recurrent aspiration.  He continued with tube
feedings and pulled out his NG tube on a couple of occasions.
He, therefore, received one day of PPN to maintain his
nutrition prior to his discharge.  He had a repeat video
swallow evaluation which did not demonstrate aspiration.  He
is tolerating soft foods at this time.

5.  ANEMIA/LOWER GI BLEED:  The patient was noted to have OB
positive stools during his admission.  His hematocrit trended
down from 26 and he received 3 units of packed red blood
cells.  His hematocrit was stable at 33 at the time of
discharge.

6.  DEPRESSION:  The patient has a history of depression.  He
was restarted on his Prozac and Risperdal.  He will require
outpatient psychiatric follow-up.

7.  LINE CLOT:  The patient was with nonocclusive thrombus
and right IJ identified on [**2191-6-2**].  The patient has been on
Lovenox.  He will require three months of anticoagulation
from [**2191-6-2**].  He will transition to Coumadin.  His
hematocrit will be followed given his history of bleeding.

8.  DELIRIUM:  The patient was very confused and very
agitated upon leaving the MICU, likely from Fentanyl and
Ativan during his intubation.  Antidepressants and sedatives
were held.  He slowly had clearing of his mental status.  He
required a sitter for most of his stay.  At the time of
discharge, he is pleasant but confused.  He no longer
requires a one-to-one sitter.  Delirium is improving.
