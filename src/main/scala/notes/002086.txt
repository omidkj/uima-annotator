76 y.o. F with multiple CV problems transferred from [**Name (NI) **]
for concern of cholangiocarcinoma. Over 2 weeks, patient had
increased pruritus. U/S of liver showed ductal dilatation with
bilirubin elevation. GI at [**Hospital1 **] performed ERCT [**2138-2-5**] with
sphincterotomy with stent (8.5Fr 12 cm). ERCP findings
concerning for cholangiocarcinoma with hilar stricture c/w
cholangiocarcinoma on right side

CAD s/p pacemaker, s/p cath [**2133**]: 70% stenosis, HTN, DM, h/o
DVT/PE, pancreatitis

Social History:
widowed with children
denied etoh/smoking/illicit drugs
independent at senior living

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2138-2-7**], a cholangiogram was performed to evaluate the bile
duct anatomy. This demonstrated severely dilated left-sided
hepatic ducts with high-
grade stricture approximately 2 cm in lenght extending from the
confluence of the common hepatic and left hepatic ducts to just
central to the
confluence of the segment II and segment III left hepatic ducts.
Mildly
dilated right anterior ducts were noted with a stricture in the
central right
anterior ducts as well as a markedly dilated gallbladder were
also noted. The
patient's post ERCP plastic stent was noted within the common
duct with
extension superiorly into the superior common hepatic duct. The
right posterior ducts were not visualized likely due to high
grade stricture or obstruction of central right posterior ducts.
 An 8 French internal/external biliary drain was placed via the
left biliary system after cholangioplasty of strictured region
to 5 mm. On [**2-9**] she spiked a temperature to 102.5 with chills.
Blood and urine cultures were done. All were negative. On [**2-10**],
bile was sent for culture growing Klebsiella pneumoniae.  Unasyn
had been started prior to the Cholangiogram and this was
continued for 5 days until bile cultures revealed that
Klebsiella sensitivity to Unasyn was indeterminate. It was
otherwise pansensitive. Unasyn was switched to Cipro on [**2-12**]
after 5 days of Unasyn. Fever resolved. Overall, LFTs trended
down.

On [**2-9**], a triple phase CT was done showing a large
Klatskin-type hilar mass with imaging characteristics compatible
with a cholangiocarcinoma. There was intrahepatic bile duct
dilatation in all segments except for segment III, where there
was an internal-external biliary drain and a biliary stent. The
left portal vein was completely encased by tumor and minimal
enhancing portal vein is seen. There were numerous enlarged
porta hepatis lymph nodes. A small anterior pelvic wall hernia
and small pleural effusions were noted.

A cardiac workup was started with TTE noting LVEF of 45-50%,
mild to moderate MR, mild pulmonary systolic HTN. Of note, on
[**2-12**], she had an episode of L chest pain when transferring from
chair to bed. O 2 2 liters and NTG 0.4 sl was given with relief.
EKG was unchanged, cardiac enzymes were negative. She had no
further episodes of chest pain. It was noted that her hct was 26
and she was given 2 units of PRBC. Hct increased to 33.

On [**2-13**], an ERCP was performed to remove the previously placed
stent at OSH. She did have a questionable run of V tach after
the procedure. She then underwent placement of left and right
wall stents with placement of PTCs thru the wall stents.
Findings were notable for a Klatskin type biliary stricture at
confluence of central right and left ducts extending to upper
common hepatic duct (obstructive on right), this was balloon
dilated. Metallic biliary stenting with two 8mm Wallstents
deployed side
by side and extended into the right and left hepatic ducts
crossing the stricture at the confluence of the right hepatic
ducts. Ursodiol was started. The next day, IR removed the right
and left PTCs that were thru the wall stents as stents were in
satisfactory position. LFTs trended down post procedure.

Post procedure, she was hypertensive requiring iv hydralazine.
She was transferred to the SICU overnight for management. She
was extubated and then transferred back to the med-[**Doctor First Name **] unit.

Her case was presented at the Tumor Board and she was found to
be unresectable. After discussing findings with the patient and
her family, an Oncology Consult was obtained. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] met
with her and discusses possible options. A chest CT was
recommended to evaluate for any possible metastatic lesions for
staging. This showed a few scattered peripheral lung nodules as
described, with the largest measuring 5 mm in the right upper
lobe. Small bilateral pleural effusions and mild intralobular
septal thickening at the lung bases was noted.  A density in the
subcarinal station may represent fluid in a pericardial recess
versus an enlarged lymph node. Calcified granuloma in the lung
and several in the spleen were consistent with prior
granulomatous exposure. A follow up outpatient appointment with
Oncology was set up to discuss options.

PT declared her safe for discharge to home. VNA services were
arranged. She was discharged with stable vital signs.
