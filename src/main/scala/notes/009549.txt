saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery and
saphenous sequential vein graft to obtuse marginal-1 and 3

History of Present Illness:
81 yo male with hx of previous MI in [**2163**] who had undergone
multiple angioplasties to RCA, Left CX, LAD and OM1 admitted to
OSH with hyperkalemia and elevated creatinine found on routine
blood work at PCP's office. He subsequently developed chest pain
and and a run of VTach in the ER.  He was started on an
amiodarone gtt and admitted to the ICU. He ruled in for a NSTEMI
with positive serum troponin. Cardiac cath was performed and he
was found to have 3 V CAD. Tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for
CABG/MVR.

Pertinent Results:
[**2191-4-4**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium and right atrium are
normal in cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or
the body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe focalities in
the inferior and anterior septal walls consistent with ischemic
heart disease.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation was dynamic. Right after sternotomy, PA pressures
increased to 60/30 and the mitral regurgitant jet became
posteriorly directed approaching a 3+ MR> Within 5 minutes, this
jet reversed back to mild to moderate regurgitant jet with
baseline PA pressures of 40/25. These findings were conveyed to
the surgeon. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was
notified of the results on Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] before surgical incision.
Post_Bypass: Normal RV systolic function. LVEF 35 to 40%. There
is mild improvement of the walll motion abnormalities in the mid
to distal septum. Mild AI. Trivial TR. Thoracic aorta is intact.
There was mild mitral regurgitation post coronary artery bypas
grafting.
[**2191-4-4**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA no stenosis. Left ICA stenosis
60-69%.
[**2191-4-2**] Chest CT: 1. 3.2 cm ascending thoracic aorta. 2.
Calcifications of the aortic valve and coronary arteries.
Scattered vascular calcifications of the thoracic aorta.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] was transferred from [**Hospital6 **] after being
ruled in for a NSTEMI and cardiac cath showing severe three
vessel coronary artery disease. Upon admission he was medically
managed and underwent pre-operative work-up which included a
echo, carotid u/s and chest CT. On [**4-4**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 4. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op
day one his chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Epicardial pacing wires were
removed on post-op day three. He continued to improve and worked
with physical therapy during post-op course for strength and
mobility. He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells for
a hematocrit of 25.1 which increased to 27.2 and was stable at
the time of discharge.   On post-op day four he appeared to be
doing well and was discharge to home with his significant other
and [**Name2 (NI) 25170**] nurse services.  H was given the  appropriate
medication and follow-up appointments.
