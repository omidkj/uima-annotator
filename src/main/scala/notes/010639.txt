Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
CP, STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization.  BMS to right coronary
Echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
49yo man with hx of hyperlipidemia, HTN who had a STEMI. He was
driving his truck today and suddenly experienced SSCP. It was
[**9-20**], stabbing "clamp-like," radiating to left arm and assoc
with SOB and dizziness. It worsened over 2-3 minutes and he
pulled his truck over and called 911. He had no nausea,
palpitations, or syncope. EMS arrived and administered 4 sprays
of ntg with CP improving to [**3-21**]. Pt refused morphine for pain
control. EKG showed STE inferiorly so EMS called code-STEMI and
brought pt to the [**Hospital1 **].
.
Pt was in ED for <10m and received ASA 325, plavix 600. He was
brought to cath lab. Cath lab: pt received heparin and
integrillin boluses. Found to have 95% mid RCA lesion and upon
stenting, SBP dropped to 80s. Dopa started and increased to
20mcg/m with good BP control. Then had HR to 30s so atropine 1mg
given. BMS placed in mid RCA and dopa weaned off. Pt was CP free
after stent placement.
.
Currently, he feels well. He c/o mild LBP which is chronic.
Otherwise, denies CP, palpitations, SOB, abd pain.
.
Exercise tolerance: can walk up 3 flights of stairs without CP
but with mild SOB. Can lift >100 lbs of wt without CP.
.
ROS: neg for F/C/syncope. No recent URIs or abd pain. chronic
constipation. Denies hx of stroke, TIA, DVT, PE, bleeding. No
claudication. Pos for mild periph edema. Denies PND, orthopnea

Cardiac Catheterization: [**2119-11-8**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
two vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary artery disease.  The
LAD had
a 70-80% stenosis of the distal D1.  The LCx had mild luminal
irregularities.  The RCA had a hazy 95% stenosis in the
mid-portion.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 15 mmHg.  There was mild pulmonary
artery
systolic hypertension with PASP of 40 mmHg.  The cardiac index
was
preserved at 3.9 L/min/m2.  There was evidence of mild systolic
and
diastolic systemic arterial hypertension with SBP 140 mmHg and
DBP 96
mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting og the mid RCA with a 3.5 x 18
mm VISION
BMS which was postdilated with a 3.75 x 13 mm HIGH sail balloon
at 12
ATM. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
dissection and
slow flow in the AM which improved with IC adenosine. (See PTCA
comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right sided filling pressures, mild pulmonary artery

systolic hypertension, and mild systolic and diastolic systemic
arterial
hypertension.
3. Acute Inferior STEMI managed by PCI of the mid RCA with a
BMS.


TTE (ECHO): [**2119-11-9**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior wall, and
hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferolateral wall. The
remaining segments are normal to slightly HYPERkinetic (LVEF =
45-50%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is focal basal right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Mild regional right ventricular systolic dysfunction. No
pulmonary hypertension or significant valvular disease seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
CAD / STEMI: 49yo man with hx of hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
tobb abuse presents with CP and was found to have a STEMI- ST
elevations in inferior leads- Q wave infarct upon repeat ECGs,
patient was taken to cath lab emergently, ER to cath lab time 9
minutes.  Found to have a mid RCA lesion and received a bare
metal stent for this.  Prior he was plavix loaded.  Continued on
plavix 75mg daily x 3 months at least, ideally 1 year.  Aspirin
325mg daily, beta blocker, statin and ACE inhibitor started.
Patient pain free post intervention.  Echo revealed a slightly
depressed EF of 45-50%, mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with akinesis of the basal inferior wall, and
hypokinesis of the inferior septum and inferolateral wall.
Given CK peak of only 315 and patient is asymptomatic would
repeat in 3 months as a component of this may be stunned
myocardium.  Fasting lipids reveal a total Cholesterol of 177,
Triglycerides of 255, HDL of 24, LDL of 102.  Patient started on
lipitor 80mg daily in the acute setting.  Discharged
uneventfully.

Tobbacco use: patient using chantix and has cut down his smoking
over the past 2.5 months, he was urged to quit smoking and
seemed to be contemplative.
