PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 96.1
degrees Fahrenheit, his heart rate was 78, his blood pressure
was 126/65, his respiratory rate was 22, and his oxygen
saturation was 99% on 60% of FIO2 .  Central venous pressure
was 12.  In general, the patient was mildly tachypneic;
otherwise, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the neck was supple.  The pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The oropharynx was
clear.  The lungs revealed bilateral crackles halfway up.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  There was a [**1-31**] holosystolic murmur at the left
lower sternal border best heard at the apex.  The abdomen
revealed there were positive bowel sounds.  The abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Mildly obese.  Extremity
examination revealed 1+ lower extremity edema.  Neurologic
examination revealed the patient was alert and oriented.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 15, his hematocrit was 33.2, and his platelets was 121.
His INR was 1.2.  Sodium was 138, potassium was 4, chloride
was 97, bicarbonate was 25, blood urea nitrogen was 69,
creatinine was 4, and his blood glucose was 290.  His
magnesium was 1.8, his phosphorous was 2.8, and his calcium
was 9.6.  FK506 level was 7.9.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed asymmetric
pulmonary edema.

A renal ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed no
evidence of hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection,
resistive indices were between 0.51 and 0.67.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's baseline
creatinine was approximately 2.  The patient had a peak
creatinine on this admission of 4.2.  This was in the setting
of congestive heart failure and rapid atrial fibrillation.
In addition, during that time he was being aggressively
diuresed and had received colchicine for his gout flare.
Therefore, it was felt that the renal failure was likely
multifactorial with decreased renal perfusion secondary to
congestive heart failure and decreased cardiac output.  In
addition, some diuretic was felt to be a factor.  However, in
light of the patient's hematuria and immunosuppressed status
with a transplanted kidney, there was concern over possible
BK infection.

The patient underwent a renal biopsy on [**2-6**] and had his
immunosuppression decreased slightly with a reduction in his
CellCept from 1000 mg twice per day to 500 mg twice per day.
The patient is followed by the [**Hospital 10701**] Clinic, and his
biopsy results will be followed up as an outpatient.

Over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, his renal
function improved daily once his tachycardia and congestive
heart failure were under control.  On the day of discharge,
the patient's creatinine was back at his baseline.  However,
his ACE inhibitor will continued to be held and will
eventually be restarted as an outpatient.

2.  RENAL TRANSPLANT ISSUES:  The patient had a renal
transplant in [**2128**] for renal failure secondary to
hypertension and diabetes.  The patient will be maintained on
tacrolimus 5 mg by mouth twice per day, prednisone 5 mg
by mouth once per day, and CellCept [**Pager number **] mg by mouth twice per
day for his immunosuppression.

The patient was to have a tacrolimus level checked within one
week of discharge and have these results called to the
[**Hospital 10701**] Clinic.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient has severe
mitral regurgitation with a normal ejection fraction and was
thought to have flash pulmonary edema with his rapid atrial
fibrillation and atrial flutter with heart rates in the 130s
to 140s.  He was initially controlled with Lopressor and
digoxin; however, once he converted to a sinus rhythm and his
rates slowed, the patient was changed over to amiodarone (per
Cardiology recommendations).  The patient was to be loaded
with one week of 400 mg of amiodarone by mouth twice per day
followed by one week of 400 mg of amiodarone by mouth once
per day, followed by initiation of his maintenance dose of
200 mg by mouth every day.

During this hospitalization, the patient had thyroid function
tests checked which revealed a mildly elevated
thyroid-stimulating hormone of 5.2.  The patient should have
his primary care physician recheck his thyroid function
within three to four weeks of discharge.  In addition, it was
recommended that the patient have baseline pulmonary function
tests within the next three to four weeks after discharge.

The patient was to follow up with his cardiologist within
three to four weeks of discharge to address the issue of his
severe mitral regurgitation and the potential need for mitral
valve replacement.  If the patient wishes to follow up with
a new cardiologist, he has been given the name of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
here at [**Hospital1 69**].

On [**1-31**], the patient had flash pulmonary edema and
evaluated acute respiratory distress.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and required a short
2-day intubation for airway protection.  He self-extubated
within two days and did not require re-intubation.  He
continued to diurese throughout his hospitalization.  On the
day of discharge, he was comfortable; breathing room air and
saturating in the high 90s.

4.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND ATRIAL FLUTTER ISSUES:  On the
day of discharge, the patient had a normal sinus rhythm with
his rate well controlled in the 70s.  He has a history of
atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter and has not been on
Coumadin for anticoagulation.  The patient was instructed to
follow up with his primary care physician within one week to
discuss anticoagulation as it is clearly indicated in this
case to decrease his risk of stroke.  However, the patient is
a Jehovah Witness and will not accept blood product
transfusions.  Therefore, a colonoscopy and possible
endoscopy were recommended if there is concern over possible
gastrointestinal bleeding with the initiation of
anticoagulation therapy.

5.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was admitted on a beta
blocker and
