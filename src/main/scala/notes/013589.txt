Physical Exam:
Temperature 99.0, pulse 73, blood pressure 94/49, respirations
21, oxygen saturation 96% on room air
General: awake, alert and oriented times 3
Head and neck: [**6-2**] centimeter laceration ot posterior scalp with
some debris/[**Doctor Last Name 5691**].  No involvement of the galea.  Pupils equal
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.
Midface stable.  Tympanic membranes clear. dentition intact.  C
collar in place
Pulmonary: clear to auscultation bilaterally
Cardiac: regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops
Abdomen: soft, nontender, nondistended
Genitourinary: Foley in place, no gross blood
Rectal: normal tone, no gross blood
Extremities: no clubbing, cyanosis or edema

Back: no abrasions, tender on palpation of spinous processes of
upper thoracic or lower cervical spine
Neuro: alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves 2 through
12 intact.  Motor and sensation intact bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen [**2191-8-24**]:
There is a 1.4 x 1 cm area of low attenuation seen in the right
lobe of the liver likely representing a simple cyst. It was
previously seen on the study from [**2189-3-21**]. Another
small subcentimeter area of low attenuation is present in the
right lobe which is too small to characterize. The rest of the
liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is not visualized. The
spleen, adrenals, kidneys, pancreas appear unremarkable. There
is no free air or free fluid. There is no mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph adenopathy. The evaluation of the bowel is
incomplete due to lack of oral contrast. However, it grossly
appears unremarkable. The inferior vena cava appears thin in the
antero-posterior diameter. This is of inknown clinical
significance.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple diverticula are
present in the large bowel without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no free air or free fluid. The urinary bladder and
distal ureters appear unremarkable. There is no pelvic or
inguinal lymph adenopathy.

No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified. No
fractures are seen. There is a lumbar dextroscoliosis.
Degenerative changes are seen in the spine.

CT RECONSTRUCTIONS: Multiplanar reconstructions confirm the
absence of an acute abdominal pathology.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of traumatic injury.

CT cspine [**2191-8-24**]:
The occipital condyles are well-aligned with the C1 lateral
masses. C2 through C7 alignment is anatomic. There is multilevel
degenerative disk disease from C3 to C6. There is some
multilevel uncovertebral joint hypertrophic changes. No
prevertebral soft tissue.

IMPRESSION: Fracture of the right superior facet at C7 without
associated widening or malalignment of the facet joint. No
evidence of traumatic malalignment of the cervical spine.
Multilevel degenerative changes.

CT Head [**2191-8-24**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Extensive scalp injury near the vertex with associated
subcutaneous emphysema. No associated calvarial abnormalities.
Prominent diploic veins of uncertain clinical significance.
Gadolinium enhanced brain MRI may be helpful for excluding
underlying vascular abnormalities.

Xray clavicle [**2191-8-26**]:
No evidence of clavicular fracture. Poor visualization of the
sternoclavicular joint

MRI C-spine, [**2191-8-26**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Spinal stenosis most notably at C4-C5 and C5-C6
with evidence of bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at these
levels, consistent with degenerative disease. 2. No evidence of
cord impingement at C6-C7 or C7-C8. No subluxation of the
component vertebrae. The alignment of the cervical spine is
normal. No paraspinal pathology is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient had her head laceratoin closed, and was
resusccitated with 2 liters of Fluid for systolic blood
pressures in the 80's-90s.  She also received two units of
packed red blood cells.  Her INR was 2.4, and she was also given
FFP.  She had a 10 point drop in her hematocrit. He was admitted
to the intensive care unit for the transfusion and for regular
neuro checks.  The orthopaedic spine was consulted for a C7
Fracture, who suggested a hard C collar for 3 months, and to
follow up in three weeks.  She was transferred to the floor on
hospital day 2 in stable condition. She remained hemodynamically
and neurologically stable, and the patient was evaluated by
physical therapy who suggested physical therapy rehab for
strengtheniing, mobility and balance training and education
regarding her recent falls and her deconditioning.  The patient
was tolerating regualr food.  She did complain of some shoulder
pain but an xray of her clavicle was negative.  It was decided
that the patient should not be anticoagulated for 2 weeks for
spinal healing, but the patient should resume anticoagulation
with her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 2 weeks.  She was in stable
condition and ready for transfer to rehab.

On discharge the patient had asymptomatic bactiuria.  We spoke
to the infectious disease people at [**Hospital1 18**], and they felt that
this was not a urinary tract infection and should not be
treated, given that the patient is not having dysuria, an
elevated white count, or fevers over the 6 days in the hospital.
 if the patient develops symptoms (fever, pain with urination)
you can send a repeat urinalysis and treat her for a UTI, but
this does not require her to come back to the hospital.  She can
call [**Last Name (LF) **], [**Name8 (MD) 7805**], MD, in infectious disease if there are any
questions, who was consulted on this.
