Difficult Cross Match:
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Mr. [**Known lastname 95409**] has a
new diagnosis of an anti-K (prior diagnosis of anti-c, anti-E
and anti-Sda at [**Hospital1 18**]). K is a member of the [**Doctor Last Name **] blood group
system. Anti-K is
clinically significant and is capable of causing hemolytic
transfusion
reactions. In the future, Mr. [**Known lastname 95409**] should receive K, c and
E
antigen negative products for all red cell transfusions.
Approximately
13% of ABO compatible blood will be K, c and E antigen negative.

In addition, Mr. [**Known lastname 95409**] has an anti-Sda. Although usually
not
considered clinically significant these antibodies can
complicate blood
bank workups. Therefore, please notify the blood bank as soon as

possible if transfusion is being considered.

Reports:

TEE [**2171-12-22**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT Head [**12-22**] IMPRESSION: No CT evidence for acute intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect. Correlate clinically to decide on the
need for further workup/followup.

RUQ US [**2171-12-23**]
1. Coarsened heterogeneous hepatic echotexture without focal
lesion. Small volume of ascites and borderline splenomegaly
noted.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Prominent CBD at 8 mm.

CXR [**12-25**] Right PICC tip is in the right atrium, can be
withdrawn approximately 4 cm for more standard position. There
are low lung volumes. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left
transvenous pacemaker leads are in a standard position. Moderate
pulmonary edema has minimally increased. Small left pleural
effusion has increased. Left lower lobe retrocardiac atelectasis
has worsened.
