severe shortness of breath for "many days." Pt reports that she
has shortnes of breath at baseline (no home O2).  She was in her
usual state of health, which consists of chronic shortness of
breath and Left sided nonradiating chest pain, for which she
uses NTG 1-2 times a day.  Pt is status post RCA stenting three
years ago, since then with recurrent chest pains but negative
nuclear tests, thus suggesting noncardiac origin of the chest
pains.  Pt went to her cardiologist ([**Doctor Last Name **]) for routine
f/u today.  She reported worsening shortness of breath, and on
exam she "appeared uncomfortable, shivering and tachypneic.  The
respiratory rate is 40 per minute.  Her blood pressure is 95/70
in both arms seated, pulse is 60 and regular." She was sent to
ER for respiratory distress and lower than normal pressure.  She
reports 2 episodes of left sided nonradiating non-pleuritic
sharp chest pain with no diaphosesis at rest  each lasting 10
minutes and resolving without intervention (once while in the
cardiologist's office and once while in the ED).  She reports
that this chest pain is consistent with recurrent chest pain
that she has had at basline.  ROS positive for chills and
rhinorhea and 2 pillow orthopnea; but no PND or leg edema, no
fevers, denies nausea/vommitting/diarrhea, no cough, no dysuria.
 Per ED discussion with pcp- [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has had multiple episodes of
dyspnea with CP which is attributed to anxiety and then resolves
after r/o MI.

[**Age over 90 **] yo F w/ Sjogren's syndrome/Scleroderma, esophageal
dysmotility, CAD s/p MI X 2 and s/p RCA stent, "chest pain
syndrome" resulting in numerous admisssions and extensive
negative work-up, who presents with SOB.

# Shortness of breath/chest pain - Pt has presented with similar
symptoms multiple times in the past.  Pt does have a hx of
coronary artery disease and is status post RCA stenting 3 years
ago, but has had recurrent chest pains on multipls occasions
since which have been worked up with negative nuclear tests,
thus suggesting noncardiac origin of the chest pains.  She was
ruled out for MI w/ serial EKG's and cardiac enzymes.  While on
the medical floor the patient became extremely anxious and
developed a respiratory alkalosis to 7.84 and transferred to the
MICU for observation.  Anti-anxiolytics were used with good
effect.  Geriatrics was consulted to assist in anxiety control
and recommended clonazepam 0.25 mg [**Hospital1 **] w/ lorazepam rescue.  She
was also instructed in the use of a brown paper bag to control
anxiety -related SOB.
