Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
left-sided consolidation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with a past medical history of chronic kidney
disease, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension
transferred from an OSH with left lower/upper lobe consolidation
is being admitted from the floor for increasing oxygen
requirement.
.
Patient was started on coumadin in [**12-4**] and has intermittently
had episodes of epistaxis relieved by cauterization. Typically
he stops or decreases his coumadin dose with improvement in his
symptoms. Six days prior to admission, patient developed
epistaxis again but did not decrease his coumadin. Then on the
day of admission, patient developed epistaxis, hemoptysis with
cough productive of sputum and blood, and difficulty breathing.
He presented to an OSH where his Hct was 35.8, Cr 1.8, WBC 14.3,
and INR 2.3. Initial CXR demonstrated left-sided consolidation.
He received 500mg levofloxacin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
because his [**Hospital1 3390**] admits to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival in the ED, temp
100.4, HR 107, BP 140/69, RR 19, and pulse ox 96% on 6L NC. Labs
were notable for elevated WBC to 16.3, INR 2.6, and creatinine
1.8. He received zosyn 2.25g x 1. His pulse ox improved to 100%
on 2L and he was initially admitted to the medicine floor.
Shortly after arrival, the patient triggered for hypoxia and he
was transferred to the MICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
58 yo male with past medical history of chronic kidney disease,
GERD, and CHF was admitted with left-sided infiltrates
concerning for pneumonia and/or aspiration.
.
PLAN:
1. Left upper and lower lobe consolidation
Patient presented with left-sided consolidations. Differential
diagnosis includes the following: pneumonia, aspiration given
patient's persistent epistaxis and sleeping on his left side, or
diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. CHF appears unlikely given
unilateral findings on CXR and no additional findings of
overload. PE also appears less likely in the setting of
therapeutic INR, significant infiltrate on exam. Patient still
with significant O2 requirement in the MICU, although difficult
to interpret given patient's significant baseline nocturnal O2
requirement of 7 liters due to sleep apnea.  Levo flagyl was
continued, sputum cultures were negative.  His hematocrit was
monitored [**Hospital1 **] and was stable, humidified air was used, and
coumadin and aspirin were held.  He improved and when his O2
requirement was gone he was transferred to the medical floor
where he was stable and was discharged the following day.
.
2. Epistaxis
Patient with a history of epistaxis requiring cauterization in
the past. Currently stable without persistent epistaxis although
at high risk for rebleeding. Significant risks for epistaxis
including high flow O2 by nasal canula at night.  He did not
re-bleed.  ENT was aware of this patient should he start
bleeding.  He will follow up with ENT upon discharge.

.
3. Chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine 1.8-2.1)
Patient still within baseline, although creatinine increased
from 1.8 to 2.1 since admisison.  His creatinine stblized, lasix
was decreased to 80mh po daily.  Cacitriol and ferrous sulfate
were continued.

.
4. Atrial Fibrillation
Stable.  His coumadin and aspirin were held, and he was
instructed to discuss anti-coagulation with his [**Hospital1 3390**] upon
discharge.

.
5. GERD
Stable, continued PPI
.
6. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (diastolic CHF)
Appeared euvolemic on exam, continued [**Hospital1 8213**] - captopril 25mg PO
qid, aspirin, aldosterone antagonist - eplerenone, and lasix
It was unclear why patient is not on a beta blocker, and we
recommended outpatient follow-up
.
7. Hyperuricosuria
Stable, continued outpatient management with allopurinol 100mg
PO daily
.
8. Pancreatic Mass
Stable, continue outpatient monitoring
.
9. Cystinuria - Stable, continued captopril, consider decreasing
dose if creatinine continues to worsen but as it did not,
captopril dose remained the same
.
10. Restless Legs Syndrome - Stable, continued requip,
oxycontin, oxycodone, and gabapentin
pt's current dose of gabapentin appears quite high in the
setting of chronic renal insufficiency, recommended further
follow-up with outpatient [**Hospital1 3390**] regarding dosage
.
