CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever and hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma currently on Rituxan, who presented
from rehab on [**1-31**] with fevers to 101.2, heart rate of 160
found to be in rapid Afib, and hypotension with a systolic
blood pressure in the 70s.  Patient was started on diltiazem
drip for rapid atrial fibrillation, given IV fluids for
hypotension, and was transiently on pressors to maintain his
blood pressure.  Patient was also found to be neutropenic.
Chest x-ray showed evidence of right chest wall mass with
increased effusion and increased right-sided infiltrate
thought to be progression of his lymphoma.

Patient was initially transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU, where he
was weaned off the diltiazem and Levophed drips.  His
hypotension improved, heart rate was controlled.  Patient was
placed on antibiotics for coverage of gram-negative rods and
his mental status improved.  On [**2173-2-2**], patient was
transferred to the Medical floor for further care.  At that
time, patient denied any shortness of breath or pain, just
expressed that he was tired.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, large B-cell lymphoma diagnosed in
   [**10-21**] receiving Rituxan treatment.  History of CHOP times
   three cycles.
2. Atrial fibrillation noted in [**2172-11-19**].
3. Status post gastrectomy.
4. Status post cholecystectomy.
5. Status post TURP.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Lasix 40 q.d.
2. Tolterodine 2 mg q.d.
3. Lopressor 25 q.d.
4. OxyContin 20 b.i.d.
5. Percocet prn.
6. Protonix 40 q.d.
7. Flagyl 500 t.i.d. (for recent Clostridium difficile
   infection).
8. Calcium carbonate.
9. Neurontin 300 t.i.d.
10.      Pravachol 30 q.d.


CURRENT MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO MEDICAL FLOOR:
1. Cefepime 2 grams q8.
2. Levofloxacin 250 q.d.
3. Colace.
4. Senna.
5. Neurontin 300 t.i.d.
6. Protonix.


CURRENT VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.8, heart rate 89 and
irregular, blood pressure 105/48, respiratory rate 16, and
saturating 94-98 percent on 4 liters O2 by nasal cannula.

Patient was calm and conversant in no acute distress.  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light, no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular:  Irregularly, irregular S1, S2.  Lungs are
clear to auscultation anteriorly, but decreased breath sounds
at the bases.  Abdomen with bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
mildly distended.  Extremities:  [**11-20**] plus edema throughout.
Pulses are 2 plus bilaterally.  Neurologically:  Alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact, although mild hearing loss and sensation intact
bilaterally.  Strength and gait not assessed secondary to
weakness.

LABS ON TRANSFER TO FLOOR:  White count of 3.4, hematocrit
29.4, platelets 11.  Chemistries within normal limits.
Digoxin level 1.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was rate controlled
   initially on diltiazem and transitioned to digoxin.
   Patient received digoxin for approximately two days and
   then was maintained on low-dose diltiazem without further
   episodes of hypotension.

1. Mental status:  Patient's decline in mental status was
   likely thought to be secondary to medications, versus
   infection, versus transient hypotension.  Patient's mental
   status on transfer to floor was currently improved, and
   per family, he was close to his baseline.

1. Pneumonia/pleural effusion:  This is thought to be
   secondary to his lymphoma.  Patient was continued on
   levofloxacin.  He was given prn nebulizers and incentive
   spirometry.  Placed on aspiration precautions.  Patient
   underwent a speech and swallow evaluation, which he failed
   at the bedside.  Patient was thought to be a silent
   aspirator.  Was started on nectar-thick liquids.

1. Hypotension:  Currently resolved.  Patient is restarted on
   Lasix for gentle diuresis.

1. Thrombocytopenia thought to be side-effect of
   chemotherapy.  There is no current active signs of
   bleeding.  Patient did not require blood products.

1. Neutropenia thought to be functional versus chemical.
   Patient's neutropenia improved.  Cefepime was D/C'd.

1. Lymphoma:  Patient with known diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma currently not responding to further therapy.  By
   time of transfer to the floor, the patient denied any
   pain, symptoms of worsening of lymphoma.  However, during
   this hospital course, patient recognized his cancer was
   untreatable.  Patient made specific request to have his
   end of life care in the hospital.

On [**2-6**], patient began to develop increased pain and
dyspnea.  Patient was initially started on NSAID therapy,
however, is not responded.  Patient was then started on
narcotics with Morphine initially.  Multiple family
discussions were held as to how to satisfy patient's wishes
for end of life care.  Patient's code status was changed to
comfort measures only.  The patient was started on a Morphine
drip to titrate to alleviate pain.  Pain was primarily rib
pain whereas penetrating through his bones.

On [**2-9**], patient expired.  Family was notified.  Postmortem
was declined.
