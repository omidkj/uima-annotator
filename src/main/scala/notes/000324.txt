CTA Chest Prelim Read:
limited study for segmental and subsegmental branches, however
no central PE seen. multifocal opacities concerning for
pneumonia


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, shortness of
breath, possible PE
.
# respiratory distress: likely due to anxiety, pna, potential
PE.  Considering fever, cough w/ sputum and CXR, likely that
there si some component of PNA vs. reactive airways.  Also, pt
is prothrombotic considering not active, pregnant and smoker.
PE a possibility, yet CTA did not demonstrate any large filling
defect.  Treated wtih antibiotics for likely pna and also
prednisone/nebs for reactive airways.  Reassuring that patient's
saturations remain relatively stable off of O2 (95 --> 93).
- f/u final CTA of chest -- wet read demonstrates no e/o central
PE, but not good study for segmental / sub-segmental.  will get
LENIs
- continue azithromycin and ceftraixone
- continue prednisone 50mg qd
- continue atrovent standing q6hrs, hold on albuterol for now
considering sinus tachycardia
- continue moist O2
- ABG

breathing comfortably with no supplemental oxygen.
BPs improved on Nifedipine
Glucoses controlled with insulin
Fetal testing reassuring with NSTs reactive twice daily. Repeat
ultrasound on [**1-15**] reassuring.
Urine 24 hour testing 600+ mg protein/24 hours, supporting a
diagnosis of mild preeclampsia
Urine testing showed 10-100K e.coli and enterococcus, uncertain
if this was contaminant. Patient refused straight cath but
repeat urine culture (clean catch) pending at the time of
discharge.

Patient requested discharge on [**1-23**] and [**1-16**] and was
