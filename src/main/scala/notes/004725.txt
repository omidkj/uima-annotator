Chief Complaint:
scheduled admission for autologous stem cell transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
A 61-year-old woman with amyloidosis, being admitted for
autologous stem cell transplant. The patient was in her usual
state of health until [**1-/2179**], then
she developed pneumonia.  She responded to antibiotics with
resolution of fever and cough that continued after that point to
have progressive fatigue, weight loss, early satiety, and
constipation.  The patient as part of her workup underwent a
24-hour urinalysis, which showed elevated quantitative protein
with the presence of Bence [**Doctor Last Name **] that is representing a minority
of the protein with a presence of albuminuria.  She had a
protein to creatinine ratio that was markedly elevated at 12.0.
She underwent a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed 10-20% plasma
cells with some areas of amyloid deposition.  A skeletal survey
showed no bony lesions.  The patient underwent a renal biopsy,
which confirmed the presence of amyloidosis.  She did not need a
primary criteria for diagnosis of multiple myeloma and was felt
that this was a primary amyloidosis in the setting of an
underlying plasma cell dyscrasia.  She underwent an extensive
pretransplant evaluation was seen by Cardiology.  Her ejection
fraction was intact.  She has had some ventricular hypertrophy
on echocardiogram.  She underwent a MRI, which did show some
evidence of amyloidosis.  She underwent a stress test, which
showed good effort, no evidence of ischemic disease, and
ultimately after extensive discussions with Cardiology, it was
felt that the patient did have increased risk of transplantation
in the setting of amyloidosis, but that this risk was not
prohibitive and the functional impairment of the heart was quite
modest.  The patient underwent stem cell mobilization with G-CSF
and collected 8 million CD34 cells per kilo with good viability
and is now being admitted for autologous stem cell transplant.
The patient's primary complaint is continued to be fatigue and
some abdominal discomfort.  She has had easy bruisability with a
normal PT and PTT.  She has had no evidence of congestive heart
failure.  Has had some mild edema in her lower extremities.  She
has had no shortness of breath, cough, fevers, sweats, chills,
or other localizing complaints.

meed criteria for multiple myeloma. Being prepared for
autotransplant; received GCSF treatment starting [**6-19**] for stem
cell collection.
2. Normal EF, minimal diastolic dysfunction, normal stress test.

3. Asthma

7. S/p tonsillectomy at age 21


Social History:
She works as a hairdresser. She smoked for 30 years, she stopped
for approximately 9 years but then restarted 7 years ago. Mother
with history of colon cancer.

Family History:
She has a sister with rheumatoid arthritis, mother with history
of colon cancer.

.
CXR [**7-22**]: Right effusion. In order to see any underlying lung
disease on the right, a left decubitus rather than a right
decubitus views would be necessary.
.
CT [**7-24**]: Large right-sided and smaller left-sided pleural
effusions. Moderate gallbladder distension without evidence of
cholecystitis. Apparent wall thickening of the descending colon
is likely secondary to collapse, although an intrinsic process
cannot be excluded on this examination. There is no pericolonic
stranding. Clinical correlation is advised.
.
Chest CT [**7-25**]: 1. 11 mm left apical spiculated mass with
pathologic mediastinal adenopathy is concerning. A PET scan is
recommended for further evaluation. 2. Bilateral pleural
effusions with associated atelectasis (right greater than left).

.
Head CT [**7-25**]: No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
Echo [**7-25**]: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
Ventricular cavity sizes appear small suggestive of hypovolemia.

.
CXR [**7-27**]: Moderate right and small left pleural effusion have
progressively enlarged since [**7-22**]. Mild pulmonary edema and
mediastinal venous engorgement indicate biventricular cardiac
decompensation, although heart is not particularly enlarged.
Severe right lower lobe atelectasis is partially obscured by
pleural effusion.
.
[**7-28**] LUE U/S: Limited study, no subclavian, axillary, or
internal jugular thrombus.
.
[**8-4**] CXR: Almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema.
Bilateral pleural effusions improved.
.
[**8-4**] Irregular Antibodies: This patient has a newly acquired
anti-Jka (Kidd) antibody. Kidd antibodies are IgG antibodies
that fix complement. They have the potential to cause delayed
hemolytic transfusion reactions that are intravascular and
severe. The possiblility of delayed hemolytic transfusion
reaction as well as the fact that the Coombs test was negative
was discussed with the clinical team. These reactions typically
occur from 7-10 days post sensitization but may occur later. As
a result, the patient must receive blood products lacking the
Jka antigen should future need for transfusion arise.
.
Lung Scan [**8-5**]: This is a limited examination. Perfusion
abnormalities are
consistent with the patient's known right sided pleural
effusion. There are no other segmental or subsegmental perfusion
defects.
.
Echo [**8-5**]: The left atrium is normal in size. There is symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is small. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is
no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient
is likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
very small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2179-7-25**], findings are similar although views are
technically suboptimal for comparison. A very small pericardial
effusion is now detected.
.
CXR [**8-14**]: 1) New small left pleural effusion with unde
