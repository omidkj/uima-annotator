History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Patient is an 80yo male with PMH of
duodenal ulcer, COPD, and CAD s/p CABG who presents with several
days of black tarry stools. Patient was last in his usual state
of health approximately 4 days prior to presentation when he
presented to his PCP for diffuse [**Name9 (PRE) 6653**] abdominal pain. At
the time he did not have bloody BM and he was discharged with
instructions to be mindful for the development of this. He then
developed black, tarry bowel movements the following day at
home. He attempted to contact his PCP and defer treatment until
he could see his PCP at the next available appointment but
presented to the ED after he had uncontrollable black tarry BM's
resulting in him soiling 8 pairs of underpants.

In the ED, initial VS were 96.8 71 148/72 16 98%. He was having
melanic stool with fresh blood consisting of one large bowel
movement but has had none since. There was a little blood on NG
lavage which cleared with 400cc. He had a lactate of 2.1. In the
ED he endorsed chest pressure and had and ECG with non-specific
changes and troponin was sent.

VS prior to transfer were 97.6 65, 144/68. He arrived to the
floor with no further bloody BM and no more chest pain or
pressure.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	 	Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 6655**]
Reason: eval for NGT position
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   80 year old man with UGIB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for NGT position
Final Report
INDICATION:  80-year-old man with upper GI bleed.  Evaluate for
NG tube
position.

COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from [**2180-5-31**].

TECHNIQUE:  Two portable chest radiographs were provided.

FINDINGS:  NG tube is difficult to visualize; however, appears
to be coursing
below the diaphragm likely within the stomach.  The patient is
status post
median sternotomy.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural
effusion, or
pneumothorax.  The cardiac size appears enlarged, but unchanged
from the prior
exam.  Osseous structures are intact.

IMPRESSION: NG tube tip likely within the stomach.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


ECG	Study Date of [**2180-9-9**]  12:25:22 PM

Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of 91. Diffuse
non-specific
repolarization abnormalities. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

ECG	Study Date of [**2180-9-10**]  9:19:24 AM

Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. Baseline
artifact. Poor
R wave progression in leads V1-V4 of unclear significance.
Diffuse
repolarization changes, cannot exclude anterolateral ischemia.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2180-9-9**] sinus
rhythm has replaced atrial fibrillation, ST segment changes have
slightly
improved.

Birth Date:	[**2100-6-22**] (80 years)	Instrument:	GIF-H180 ([**Numeric Identifier 6659**])
ID#:	[**Numeric Identifier 6660**]		
Medications:	Midazolam 5 mg IV
Fentanyl 125 micrograms
Indications:	Gastrointestinal bleeding
Procedure:	The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
moderate sedation. Supplemental oxygen was used. The patient was
placed in the left lateral decubitus position and an endoscope
was introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct
visualization until the third part of the duodenum was reached.
Careful visualization of the upper GI tract was performed. The
vocal cords were visualized. The procedure was not difficult.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications.
Findings:
Esophagus:	Normal esophagus.
Stomach:	
Mucosa:	Diffuse gastropathy was noted in the whole stomach. No
evidence of active or recent bleeding.
Duodenum:	
Lumen:	The first part of the duodenum was mildly stenosed
suggesting chronic duodenitis. The scope traversed the lesion
without difficulty.
Mucosa:	Erythema and congestion of
