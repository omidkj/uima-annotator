CT Sinus- ? fractures of the left zygomatic arch of left
zygomatic arch and left squamus temporal bone of undetermined
age. Clinical correlation with point tenderness recommended.

CT Head-Stable left subtle contusion and minimally displaced
zygomatic arch fracture.

ECHO-Conclusions:The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the basal 2/3rds of the septum. The remaining
segments contract well. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Mild
aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild-moderate
mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
CHF
Pt. transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from outside hospital s/p fall at home
and was judged to have zygoma fx. not needing intervention. Pt.
was transferred to SICU for two days. Serial CXR's showed
evidence of CHF, and EKG showed changes suggestive of NSTEMI.
TpnT trended up from 0.04 to 0.50 as did CK. On Mon [**1-19**] pt.
was transferred to med floor from SICU for further mgmt. and was
continued on beta-blocker and lasix. Echo and CXR were obtained
for further evaluation, confirming low EF and some akinesis but
signs of improvement. Pt. was put on ACE inhibitor and started
on nesiritide and monitored throughout week. She showed
progressive clinical improvement on this medical regimen along
with low Na diet and goal of minus 1L net fluid intake daily and
incentive spirometry.TpnT, however, continued to trend upward
after a brief drop, reaching 2.02. CK trended down and remained
flat and pt. showed no signs of new MI after repeat EKGs.
Cardiology consulted and agreed with regimen focusing on
diuresis with ACEI. It was decided there was no need to
continually monitor Tpn in absence of clinically concerning
sx's. Pt. continued to improve and was able to increase
activity, and ceased to experience SOB. Spironolactone was added
to regimen. Expectation is that she will remain stable and be
able to return to acute rehab center after discharge.

CAD/Dyslipidemia
Pt. had known athersclerosis and was kept on atorvastatin for
duration of her hospital stay. NSTEMI/demand ischemia that
occurred in SICU was likely exacerbated or caused by coronary
occlusion and cardiology consult addressed this during pt.'s
course. Pt. will need to continue on statin with plan to have
assessment for eventual cardiac catheterization. when she is
fully recovered post-discharge, she should obtain MIBI
scan/stress test.

AFib
Pt. had longstanding hx of AF prior to transfer to our ED and
SICU. On med floor, pt. was continued on beta blocker for rate
control and digoxin to help rhythym. Digoxin levels were
monitored and pt. was found to have therapeutic level which
trended upward, prompting dose reduction. Level increased again
and digoxin was d/c'ed but bb continued. Throughout her course
pt. was frequently tachycardic and in non-sinus rhythym. SC
heparin was used for prophylaxis, and AF continued to stay under
reasonable control during her stay. Following discharge, she
can, at her physician's discretion, return to a regular Coumadin
regimen with possible aim for cardioversion vs. rate control
medical mgmt.

Neurological
Pt. was evaluated by neurosurgical and orthopedic consult in ED
and had head CT as well. There was agreement that injury was
nondisplaced zygomatic fx. not requiring invasive repair.
However, Coumadin that pt. had been on prior to arrival was
d/c'ed for fear of bleeding risk. While on medical service, pt.
was prophylaxed with SC heparin and low dose aspirin and
remained stable for rest of her stay. She will be instructed to
follow up with ophthalmologist and/or orthopedist as needed
after discharge.

UTI
Pt. developed a UTI shown to be Klebsiella pneumonia with
pansensitivity. She was treated with a 7 dd course of
antibiotic, first with 3 dd.levo. This was suspected to
contribute to daily nausea she experienced, and was thus
switched to ceftriaxone. Pt. did well throughout week with
improvement in nausea sx's. She remained afebrile and Foley was
eventually d/c'ed.

Pain
Pt. was given acetaminophen during her stay and a lidocaine
patch as well. SHe mainly experience LUQ/L lower chest pain that
resolved upon relief of her constipation via lactulose and
enema. Lateral axillary pain was present which was thought to be
due to fall and responded well to morphine while in ED then to
PO pain meds and lidocaine patch whle on med floor.

Hypernatremia
Pt. initially presented with upward trend in serum Na. This was
addressed by instituting a low Na diet and encouraging free
water intake. She responded well, normalized, and remained
stable for the duration of her stay.

Following discharge, Sr. [**Known lastname 106556**] should return to acute rehab and
follow up with her cardiologist to decide on the following
issues: 1) how best to address pump function and CAD and 2) ho
