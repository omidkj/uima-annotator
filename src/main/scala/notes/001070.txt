History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old female with history of multiple
sclerosis, dementia, neurogenic bladder with indwelling foley,
right staghorn calculus, left obstructing UVJ stone with
nephrostomy tube presented from [**Hospital1 1501**] with worsening lethargy and
no output from nephrostomy tube for the two days prior to
admission. The patient was also reported to have been satting at
77% on NBR when EMS arrived. The patient has been admitted three
times in the past year with urosepsis.

In the ER, the patient was febrile to 102.8 and tachycardic. She
had a leukocytosis to 16.4. Her foley catheter was exchanged and
foul-smelling urine emerged. She had numerous excoriations
within and around her vagina and decubitus ulcers on her sacrum.
The nephrostomy tube was encrusted, and when cleaned, purulent
discharge emerged. She also had erythema and fluctuance with
expressible pus around the nephrostomy site. The patient was
given vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl. She was transferred to
the MICU with a systolic pressure of 85 on peripheral low-dose
levophed.

Physical Exam on Discharge
VS: RR16-18
Gen: Debilitated female in no acute distress
HEENT: EOMI with horizontal nystagmus, MMM
CV: RRR, no m/g/r
Resp: anterolateral exam limited, CTAB, no w/r/r

Pertinent Results:
Abdominal XR ([**7-13**]): The left percutaneous nephrostomy tube is
in similar position
compared with prior imaging.  If the patient continues to have
symptoms and clinical concern exists for malposition of tube, a
dedicated antegrade nephrostomy tube study would be recommended.

LABS ON DISCHARGE
lab draws were discontinued due to patient and husband's wishes
for comfort measures only.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 65 year old female with history of MS,
dementia, neurogenic bladder with indwelling foley, b/l calculi
s/p left nephrostomy presenting with fatige and found to have
urosepsis.
.
ACUTE ISSUES
#Urosepsis:
The patient has long history of urinary tract infections with
MDR organisms including ESBL e. coli and pseudomonas due to her
abnormal anatomy. She has been considered for lithotripsy of
left UVJ stone in past but thought to be high risk due to
cardiac co-morbidities. The patient also has a staghorn calculus
in the right kidney. She presented febrile to 102.8 and with
systolic pressure in the 80s. Patient was found to have
foul-smelling urine from foley and purulent material emanating
from nephrostomy tube in the ER. She was started on low-dose
peripheral levophed and transferred to the MICU. She was started
on meropenem for likely ESBL E. coli and vancomycin. A Dobhoff
tube was inserted and the patient was started on tube feeds. A
goals of care discussion was had with the patient's husband, and
it was decided that the patient would seek comfort measures only
(see below). The patient was transferred to the floor for
continued management despite low pressures. On the floor she
remained clinically stable without the need for pressure
support. Her antibiotics were discontinued upon discharge.
.
#Goals of care:
The goals of care were discussed with the patient and husband in
both the ICU and the general medicine floor. After a long
discussion, it was decided that the patient would be continued
on IV antibiotics and tube feeds while inpatient. On the floor,
the patient removed her Dobhoff tube, and it was decided with
the husband not to reinitiate it. The patient's husband wished
to keep patient comfort at the forefront, but wanted to continue
interventions until the patient either declined or discontinued
them herself. Palliative care was consulted and it was planned
that the patient would return to her longterm care facility for
hospice services. IV antibiotics were discontinued, as they
would require PICC placement, which would not have been
consistent with pt and husband's goals of care. She was
discharged without antibiotics.
.
[**Month/Day/Year **] ISSUES
#Multiple sclerosis:
Long history of MS (14 years), quite debilitated, now
experiencing dementia. The patient's home baclofen and
cyclobenzaprine were continued while inpatient.
.
#COPD:
The patient had a history of COPD with nknown baseline status.
It was reported that the patient uses home O2 at unknown rate.
She was continued on her ipratropium and fluticasone at home
doses and she was given O2 by nasal canula as needed.
.
#Depression:
Patient has [**Month/Day/Year **] depression and has been on SSRI at home.
This was continued while inpatient.
.
