Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Percocet / Augmentin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
chest/neck pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
38 yo f with PMH of ASD and pulmonary vein anolmous circulation
(LL pulm vein drained into coronary sinus) s/p repair in [**2146**]
(coronary sinus into LA), asthma, migraines presents with dry
cough and chest pain/ neck pain exacerbated by deep breathing.
Initially, PCP felt pain was musculoskelatal and was given
flexeril, ibuprofen w/ little relief. She also reports N/V x2
days.  CXR shows a left pleural effusion with associated opacity
and a small right pleural effusion. WBC elevated to 17. She was
initially hemodynamicallyt stable but then pressure dropped to
70's/50. She was started on dopamine. Echo showed large
circumferential pericardial effusion with stranding and clotted
appearance. She was given 4L of fluid in ED with little UO,
morphine 4mg, ketorolac, ASA, tylenol, levetiracetam, dopamine,
promethazine, zofran.
.
Upon arrival to CCU she was afebrile, BP 90/60 on dopamine 5, RR
14, HR 100. Cardiac and thoracic surgery saw her in CCU and plan
was for thoracentesis and probable surgery tomorrow.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional
buttock or calf pain.  All of the other review of systems were
negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
presyncope. She denies syncope or lower extremity edema.

Past Medical History:
ASD, Migraines, asthma, endometriosis

Past surgical hx:
ASD repair in [**2146**] (repair of an ASD and baffle of ananomalous
pulmonary vein using the pericardium - so that coronary sinus
drains in left atrium), lipoma resection from lower back, cystic
ovary s/p resection, tubal ligation.

Social History:

Pertinent Results:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2150-5-18**] demonstrated:
LA is mildly dilated. A relatively immobile outpocketing is
along
the mid-interatrial septum (coronary sinus baffle) with both
systolic an  diastolic flow. No intracardiac flow is identified
with saline injection at  rest or with maneuvers. Estimated RA
pressure is 11-15mmHg.  Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional systolic
function is normal. Abnormal septal motion/position (?post op
vs. constriction - less likely).
RV chamber size is normal. RV systolic function appears
depressed. AV leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No AR. MV structurally normal with trivial
MR. Moderate [2+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension. Moderate
sized (~1.5cm) circumferential, echo-filled pericardial effusion
with some stranding c/w organization. Tamponade physiology is
not suggested on transmitral Doppler, but this can be absent
with pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ETT performed on [**2150-5-18**] normal perfusion
CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2146**] showed moderate left to right
intracardiac shunt, Secundum-type atrial septal defect,
Anomalous pulmonary vein to coronary sinus drainage.

Conclusions:
Pre pericardial drainage: The left atrium is mildly dilated. A
promient/enlarged coronary sinus is seen with a baffle joining.
Flow in the
baffle is consistent with pulmonary venous flow (this most
likely represents
the previous correction of partial an
