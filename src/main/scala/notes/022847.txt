REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate consolidation
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW ON [**1-15**]

HISTORY: Evaluate consolidation.

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views demonstrate bilateral
pleural effusions with dense right lower lobe infiltrate and

Findings
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Severe global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: AVR well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular gradients.

MITRAL VALVE: MVR well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
patient.
Conclusions
Pre_CPB:

There is moderate to severe RV systolic dysfunction. There is
trapping pockets of air along with RV free wall and in the
pulmonary arteries.
The m itral and aortic prosthesis are intact. The LV appears
empty.
Thoracic aortic contour is intact.
There is NO CIRCUMFERENTIAL PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.

There is a large pleural collection in the left side more than
the right side. There is no echocardiographic evidence of AV
separation.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on [**1-1**] where she underwent
an AVR and MVR. She was transferred to the ICU in critical but
stable condition on neo and propofol. She was given 48 hours of
vanocmycin as perio prophylaxis due to PCN allergy. She
underwent bronchoscopy for left lung white out on CXR. She was
taken emergently back to the operating room, after sudden onset
bleeding, where she underwent re-explaoration, repair of AV
dissociation, explant of mitral valve, and re-do MVR with a
mechanical mitral valve. She was transferred back to the ICU on
levophed, milrinone, epinephrine and pitressin. She remained
intubated and sedated and her drips were slowly weaned. Her
vasoactive drips were weaned to off by POD #3. She failed a CPAP
trial and tube feeds were started. She spiked a temp and was
pancultured and started on vanco and ceftazidime. Sputum culture
grew MRSA. She had afib and was started on amiodarone and
diltiazem. She was started on heparin and coumadin for
mechanical mitral valve. She was extubated on POD #5. She
remained in the ICU for aggressive pulmonary toilet. Bedside
swallow evaluation recommended thin liquids and ground solids
with supplemental tube feedings for decreased PO intake. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #12. A PICC line was placed on
[**1-14**]. She was seen by ID. CXR showed question of pneumonia,
antiobiotics were continued and bronch was planned. Bronchoscopy
was performed on [**1-16**] for RML collapse with therapeutic
aspiration of mucoid secretions. She remained in house overnight
for aggressive chest pt.  She was ready for discharge to rehab
on POD #15.
