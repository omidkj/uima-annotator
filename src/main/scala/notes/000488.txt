History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59124**] is a 61 y.o. male without a known past medical
history who presented to [**Hospital6 **] with
intermittent persistent substernal chest pressure assocaited
with epigastric pain, nausea/vomiting x 1 day.  Patient was in
his usual state of health when he began to notice these symptoms
the evening prior to presentation.  Initial ECG showed ST
elevations in the inferior leads with ST depressions in V1-V4.
He was started on a heparin gtt, brought emergently to the cath
lab, loaded with prasugrel on the table. Intraprocedurally, was
given infusion of bivalirudin.  Noted to have prox LAD 95%
occlusion, diffuse disease in Circumflex, 100% ProxRCA lesion,
s/p POBA, complicated by dissection of the RCA, covered with
BMS.  IABP was placed.  Right heart cath was performed, showing
CI 2.4, SVR 1243, PCWP 17.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation for urgent CABG.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ADMISSION EKG: Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Left axis
deviation. Left atrial abnormality. Possible right atrial
abnormality. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Inferior wall
myocardial infarction with 1-2 millimeters of ST segment
elevation in the inferior leads. One millimeter of sloping ST
segment depression in high lateral leads. T wave inversions
inferolateral leads. No previous tracing available for
comparison.

OSH CATH [**3-8**]:  prox LAD 95% occlusion, diffuse disease in
Circumflex, 100% ProxRCA lesion, s/p POBA, complicated by
dissection of the RCA, covered with BMS.  IABP was placed.
Right heart cath was performed, showing CI 2.4, SVR 1243, PCWP
17.
.
ECHO [**3-8**]:
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. No ASD by 2D
or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Moderately depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free wall thickness. Normal RV
chamber size. RV function depressed.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. Mild
to moderate ([**2-11**]+) MR.

tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for
PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to
severe inferior posterior hypokinesis/akinesis; apex is
hypokinetic as well. The right ventricular free wall thickness
is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with
depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2198-3-8**]: Lungs clear without significant effusion or
pneumothorax. Heart size and pulmonary vascularity is normal.
Apparent RUL opacity is likely superposition of venous and
osseous structures. A balloon pump marker is faintly seen
superimposed over the T6 spinous process, pulled back roughly
4cm compared wtih prior, now at the level of the carina.

Intra-op TEE
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 - 35 %) with marked inferior and apical HK
and moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+)
central mitral regurgitation is seen. Mitral annulus is 4.1 cm.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is A-Paced, on low-dose Epinephrine.
Biventricular systolic fxn is mildly improved, with EF now 35 -
40%.
There is a mitral ring repair with trace MR and no leak.
Residual mean gradient is 4.5 mmHg and area is 2.8 sq cm.
No AI. Aorta intact.
