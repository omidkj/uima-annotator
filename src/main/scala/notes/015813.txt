Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine / Codeine / Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2009**]
Chief Complaint:
right flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
nephrostomy

History of Present Illness:
85 y.o. woman with h/o CAD s/p IMI 30 yrs ago, DM, presenting
initially w/ right flank pain associated with nausea. At
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital, CT showed right sided hydronephrosis w/o
renal stones. At [**Hospital1 882**], BP= 200/96 with ekg showing ST
depressions across precordium, in addition to STE and Q waves in
II, III, aVF which were initially thought to be new (now known
to be old). CE negative X1 at OSH. The patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] where ED vitals were 98.1 178/84 64 98% 4L, and ekg was
initially thought to be showing evolving STEMI. Received
aspirin, plavix 600mg X1, and integrillin. Integrillin was later
discontinued, when Q waves identified as old. Her blood pressure
was persistently in the 160-180's while on nitro gtt and
labetolol IV boluses. In the ED. Her nitro gtt was eventually
titrated up 100mcg/hr, and after receiving a total of three
boluses of labetolol her blood pressure decreased to 155/71.
Repeat EKG showed persistent ST depressions across precordium.
She was admitted to the CCU for hypertensive emergency. Labs on
admission show troponin 0.07 (later rising to 0.11, with CKs in
40s) and creatinine of 1.3. In ED, spiked a temp to 101.4. She
received urine and blood cultures and was given cipro.

In the CCU, it was thought that she did not have STEMI instead
it appeared her clinical picture was due to demand ischemia in
the setting of hypertensive to 200s systolic. She was initially
on a labetalol gtt but was discontinued 6am [**2195-1-30**] after 4
hours on it when systolics were in the 100s. BP regimen was held
due to low systolics Urolog was consulted and right perc
nephrostomy tube was placed by IR [**1-30**]. She was started on
cipro/gent day 1= [**1-29**]. She was febrile overnight to 102.7.

On [**1-31**], pt was re-started on half of her home atenolol. On
[**2-1**], she developed assymptomatic 4 second pauses on telemetry.
Of note, the pt has a baseline RBBB, LAFB, and prolonged PR
interval.

Currently denies chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope. No abdominal pain, N/V, no headache/dizzyness.
Endorses feeling slightly confused, also endorses weakness at
home and frequent falls.

EKG: [**2195-1-29**]: Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. Left
axis deviation. Right bundle-branch block with left anterior
fascicular block. There are Q waves in the inferior leads
consistent with prior myocardial
infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

CXR [**2195-1-29**]: No prior comparisons. Allowing for technique,
cardiomediastinal contours are probably within normal limits.
Pulmonary
vascularity is normal. Diffuse reticular opacity is seen
throughout both
lungs, suggestive of underlying chronic lung disease/fibrosis.
There is no
sign of a superimposed pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion
or
pneumothorax.

Echocardiogram: [**2195-1-30**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is an inferobasal
left ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %) secondary to
iferior akinesis (with inferobasal aneurysm) and posterior
hypokinesis. The apex is also hypokinetic. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2195-2-1**]):
      CITROBACTER FREUNDII COMPLEX.    10,000-100,000
ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
