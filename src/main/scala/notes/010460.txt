Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 48 year old male with HTN, ?[**Hospital **] transferred from OSH
with bilaterally PEs, evidence of RV failure on echo.
.
1. PE. Patient noted to have large, bilateral pulmonary
embolisms on CT at OSH. He remained hemodynamically stable here
despite brief period of hypotension at [**Hospital1 **] Neeham. Echo at
[**Location (un) 620**] also concerning for for RV failure. Lysis was initially
considered on arrival but given hemodynamic stability, was not
done. Pt was transferred from ICU to the floor on HD 2 as
coumadin was started. Right DVT was confirmed on [**2126-2-1**]. He
remained asymptomatic during his entire course on the floor. He
was continued on Heparin drip until INR had reached therapeutic
goal (2.5-3.5) for 2 days. He was discharged on 7.5 mg Coumadin
daily with INR to be closely followed by PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need a
hypercoagulability workup as an outpt with his PCP as he has a
FH of PE in his father.
.
2. Anemia. Patient has anemia here. Hct has ranged from 36 to 41
since [**2119**] with no clear trend up or down. Iron studies here
were normal. Hct remained stable around 32 at time of discharge.
PCP will follow this.
.
3. Renal failure. Per PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]'s baseline is 1.1 as of [**9-29**]. Cr
was 1.7 on admission likely secondary to hypopurfusion in the
setting of large PE. At time of discharge, Cr had trended back
to baseline 1.1.
.
4. HTN. Patient on HCTZ, atenolol, and lisinopril at home for
HTN. These were all initially held in setting of large PE.
Gradually, both beta blocker and low dose lisinopril were
restarted and pt was discharged on both of these. HCTZ was not
needed for BP control while in house.
