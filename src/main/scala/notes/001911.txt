Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Sulfonamides

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2183-6-24**] - CABGx3 (Left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, vein graft to posterior descending artery,
vein graft to ramus)
[**2183-6-11**] - Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 449**] is a 55 year-old female with a history of diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia and current tobacco use who
presents with dyspnea and chest discomfort for cardiac cath.

Recently admitted ([**2183-4-28**] - [**2183-5-2**]). At that time, she had
complaints of SOB, cough and chest discomfort. A pneumonia was
diagnosed. In addition, an echo was done and showed and LVEF of
40% with severe focal hypokinesis of the distal half of the
septum and apex. Since that admission, she underwent stress
testing which showed a reversible anterior wall and fixed apical
defects. LVEF was noted to be 31%.

Over the last two weeks, the patient notes worsening DOE and
occasional exertional chest discomfort. She can recall one
specific episode approximately 2 weeks ago when she had severe
DOE during which she could not walk more than [**3-15**] steps without
severe shortness of breath. She also noted "heart fluttering"
during this time. That evening she felt exhausted and slept for
the rest of the day.

In addition to the above, the patient also reports nightly PND
(wakes up hours after falling asleep). After waking, she will
sit up and her symptoms improve. She used one pillow at night.

She is being admitted for cardiac cath and possible PCI.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2183-6-30**] 8:53 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old woman s/p cabg x3
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
HISTORY: 55-year-old woman status post CABG x3.

COMPARISON: [**2183-6-26**].

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
are stable status post median sternotomy and CABG. There is
stable enlargement of cardiac silhouette. Pulmonary vasculature
is unremarkable. The left hemidiaphragm appears elevated,
however, there is an increased distance between this contour and
the gastric bubble consistent with a subpulmonic effusion. This
is moderate in size. A small right pleural effusion is also
noted. There is associated left lower lobe atelectasis and right
mid lung linear atelectasis. Osseous and soft structures are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Moderate left and small right pleural effusions
which are larger than [**2183-6-26**]. Left effusion likely has
subpulmonic component.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
