HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year-old
male with an extensive history of coronary artery disease
status post coronary artery bypass graft times two,
congestive heart failure, history of V fibrillation arrest in
[**2185**], status post an ICD who was transferred from [**Hospital3 38285**] after presenting complaining of being shocked
multiple times by his ICD.  The patient has multiple medical
problems, but was in his usual state of health on home O2
until earlier in [**Month (only) **] when he had an episode of shortness
of breath followed by fatigue and fever.  At that time he was
admitted to [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) 1459**] where he spent one week for
pneumonia and atrial fibrillation.  Subsequently he was found
to have an atrial thrombus so he was not cardioverted.  In
subsequent weeks the patient had increased O2 requirement,
increased nebulizer use and lower extremity edema as well as
fatigue and was found to have decompensated congestive heart
failure.  Lasix was increased and Zaroxolyn started on
[**1-16**].  The patient slowly improved with loss of about
20 pounds and Zaroxolyn was discontinued.  Over the past
several nights the patient has had increased shortness of
breath with increased abdominal girth, increased weight,
increased lower extremity edema, plus paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea.  He experienced multiple ICD shocks culminating in
six or seven shocks the night prior to admission.  The
patient began to feel more increased shortness of breath on
the morning of admission and called 911 and was taken to
[**Hospital3 **].  There the patient's ICD was
interrogated and showed multiple episodes of ventricular
tachycardia, one episode of V fibrillation with 18 shocks
since [**1-19**].  He was started on a Lidocaine drip and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] where the
Lidocaine drip was discontinued.  The patient was started on
Amiodarone and admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Electrocardiogram V paced with fusion
beats, white blood cell count 8.9, hematocrit 31.3, platelets
134, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, BUN 22, creatinine 1.2, CK
32, troponin .04.  Chest x-ray cardiomegaly with a left
pleural effusion, questionable left lower lobe opacity versus
atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  A:  Rhythm, patient
with recurrent ventricular tachycardia and one episode of V
fibrillation with recurrent ICD firings.  The patient was
seen by EP to change the lower pace rate increasing it to 80
as well as programming the ATP therapy for ventricular
tachycardia.  The patient was loaded on Amiodarone.  Digoxin
was held.  Warfarin was held for possible EP study.  The
patient was diuresed aggressively with intravenous Lasix and
Zaroxolyn.  It was felt that the patient's ventricular
rhythms were likely secondary to decompensated heart failure
rather then active ischemia.  After the adjustment in the ICD
and the Amiodarone load, the patient had no further events on
telemetry.  There was consideration of placing a [**Hospital1 **] V pacer.
This decision was deferred during this hospital stay as the
patient had no further events on telemetry and there was a
question of patient's long term prognosis from his bladder
cancer.  The patient had an appointment set up to see Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic in two to three weeks.

B:  Ischemia, the patient was treated with aspirin and
statin, enzymes were cycled and he ruled out for an
myocardial infarction.  An ace inhibitor and beta blocker
were slowly titrated up.

C:  Pump, the patient was in decompensated heart failure,
diuresed aggressively with Lasix.  Echocardiogram was
performed revealing an EF of 20 to 25% with 3+ mitral
regurgitation, which was increased from his prior study.
Wall motion abnormalities including inferior and
inferolateral and apical akinesis as well as septal
hypokinesis.  His LA was moderately dilated and his left
ventricular was moderately dilated.  The patient was started
on Coreg slowly titrated up as well as Captopril.  Digoxin
continued to be held at the time of this dictation.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease as well as lung cancer and the
decompensated congestive heart failure makes his hypoxia
multifactorial in origin.  The patient improved with diuresis
as well as with nebulizer treatments.  At the time of this
dictation the patient was nearing baseline, however, was
still deconditioned and requiring more O2 then in the weeks
prior to the patient's recent illnesses according to his
wife.  [**Name (NI) **] continued on Serevent and Flovent, Atrovent and
Albuterol nebulizers as well as Mucomyst nebulizers.

3.  Hematology:  The patient with a fluctuating hematocrit at
the lowest point down to 26.7 with no clear evidence of
bleeding.  The patient was guaiac negative.  He was continued
on his Epogen as well as iron, folate and B-12 were checked,
which were normal.  He was transfused 1 unit of packed red
blood cells with a goal of keeping his hematocrit greater
then 28.  The patient's Coumadin was held on admission with
the possibility of [**Hospital1 **] V pacer.  At the time of this dictation
the decision regarding his further anticoagulation is pending
on discussion with his oncologist and therefore understanding
whether or not the [**Hospital1 **] V pacer is in his future.

4.  Oncology:  Patient with bladder cancer followed at [**Hospital3 7778**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31394**].  At the time of this dictation
attempts were being made to contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31394**] regarding
the patient's overall prognosis as this will determine his
need for placement of a [**Hospital1 **] V pacer.

5.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine bumped from 1.2 on
admission to 1.5.  This was felt likely to be secondary to
diuresis.  At this point the diuresis was slowed.

6.  Psychiatric:  Patient with multiple problems with
sundowning as he had in the
