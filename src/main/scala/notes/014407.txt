History of Present Illness:
65 year-old woman with a history of type 2 DM, MI, and multiple
[**Hospital 14192**] transferred from an OSH with mental status changes and
hypoglycemia.  History was obtained from patient's daughters.
[**Name (NI) **] has a 5-day history of cough productive of yellow, green
sputum, nausea + vomiting, and diarrhea.  Daughter notes
decreased PO intake.  Unsure if patient has had fevers or
chills.  Diarrhea described as dark brown; no melena or bright
red blood.  This morning around noon, daughter noted slurred
speech, right facial droop, and right arm weakness.  At the
time, patient complained of paresthesias in right hand.
Daughter noted patient was confused and called EMS.  EMS noted
blood glucose of 33.  She was given 2 amps of glucose and taken
to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital.  She received an additional 2 amps of D50
and a dose of ceftriaxone.  Head CT was reportedly negative.
Troponin I elevated at 1.29 with CK=1880.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Daughters deny any recent changes to patient's medications.  As
far as they know, she took her normal medication doses this
morning.  Of note, daughters report a history of TIAs associated
with slurred speech, right facial droop, and right-sided
weakness but deny any associated confusion in prior episodes.

Pertinent Results:
[**4-12**] CT Head with and without Contrast:
1. Small focus of contrast enhancement in the left frontal lobe,
not fully
characterized. Differential diagnosis includes developmental
venous anomaly, evolving infarct, and less likely infection or
tumor. MRI is recommended for further characterization.
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Hypodense focus in the pons. Differential diagnosis include
central
pontine myelinolysis and ischemic stroke. MRI is recommended for
further
characterization.
.
[**4-12**] CT Chest with and without Contrast:
1. Near-complete left lower lobe collapse.
2. Diffuse subtle centrilobular opacities and peribronchial
thickening is
consistent with small airways infection, possibly viral or
bacterial in
etiology.
3. Endotracheal tube is at the level of the carina and should be
repositioned for standard positioning.
4. Right upper lobe nodule, 4 mm, which could be followed
conservatively with Chest CT in one year.
.
[**4-12**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
is not well seen. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
.
[**4-14**] Carotid Series Duplex Ultrasound:
Moderate plaque with bilateral 40-59% carotid stenosis. Of note
both degrees of stenosis will fall to the lower end of the
range.
.
[**4-18**] CTA Head
7 x 6 mm enhancing mass within the left frontal lobe with
associated prominent vessels which may represent cavernoma with
associated
developmental venous anomaly or capillary telangiectasia.
However,an
underlying arteriovenous malformation cannot be excluded on the
basis of these images. An MRI/MRA or diagnostic cerebral
angiography is recommended to further evaluate this finding.
.
[**4-20**] Ultrasound of bilateral lower extremity veins:
No evidence of bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis

Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o female with a h/o T2DM, TIA, HTN, morbid obesity, and
hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the MICU for concern for
TIA/stroke concern. The following issues were addressed during
this admission.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T=101.1, HR=70, BP=137/52, RR=22, O2
sat = 100% on NRB.  Blood glucose was 31, and she was given an
additional unit of D50.  She was also given 2 mg of morphine.
Her slurred speech remained unchanged.  She was transferred to
the MICU for further care.
.
1. Respiratory failure
On arrival to MICU, the patient was awake and alert with mild
confusion.  Subsequently, the patient had a sharp decline in
mental status and became more somnolent - concerning for an
acute change intravascularly.  The patient was intubated due to
concern for airway protection.  Upon correction of hypercarbia,
her mental status improved and she was awake and able to follow
commands while intubated.  It was felt that her mental status
changes on presentation might be at least partially attributable
to hypercarbia secondary to obesity/sleep apnea.  The patient
was extubated on [**4-12**] and transitioned to BiPAP, but she did not
tolerate BiPAP initially and was subsequently re-intubated later
that day.  Over the course of the next week, she was weaned off
pressure support and successfully extubated on [**4-19**].  She was
started on BiPAP at night with settings of [**9-30**]. At the time of
discharge to rehab, she should be started on 15/5 of BIPAP at
night. She will ultimately need a formal sleep study after
discharge to further characterize appropriate BIPAP settings.
.
2. Mental status changes/stroke-like symptoms
The pt had a negative head CT, per OSH.  A repeat head CT was
obtained at [**Hospital1 18**] after the patient's acute decline in mental
status upon arrival in the MICU, and neurology was consulted.
CT was negative for an acute process.  Per family, the patient's
symptoms of dysarthr
