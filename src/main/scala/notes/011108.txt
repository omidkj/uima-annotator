Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the floor from the Emergency Room.
In the Emergency Room, she had an EKG which was unchanged from
prior EKGs, had a CT scan which was negative for pulmonary
embolism, had an unremarkable chest Xray. Her O2sat was as low
as 69-73%. She was placed on 5L O2 nasal cannula with an O2 sat
of 95%, given albuterol nebulizer treatments. She was admitted
to the floor.

On hospital day 2, digoxin level was 1.3 and her home digoxin
dose was changed from 0.0625mg po QD to 0.0625mg po QOD. PA &
Lateral CXR was taken the next day. Her TSH level was also found
to be slightly elevated at 5.0 and therefore a T3 & T4 level
were obtained. T3 was low at 50 and T4 was low at 3.6 so she was
started on synthroid 12.5mcg po QD. A pulmonary, physical
therapy and occupational therapy consult were obtained to help
evaluate and improve pulmonary function. She was given her home
dose of lasix.

On hospital day 3, the Pulmonary service concluded she was
malnourished and her respiratory muscles were extremely weak.
They recommended BiPAP for 8 hours during the night to help rest
her respiratory muscles, echocardiography to evaluate for
pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary function tests to evaluate
her pulmonary function. At this time her systolic blood pressure
was low in the 70s to 80s. She was given a total of 500cc NS at
a slow rate to help restore her intravascular volume along with
a slow MIVF rate.

On hospital day 4, her systolic blood pressure was in the 90s
to100s. Echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of
greater than 55%, borderline pulmonary  systolic HTN and was
otherwise normal.

On hospital day 5, she was fitted for BiPAP with 40%FiO2 and
tolerated the machine well overnight. She was electively
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for this for closer monitoring.  At this
time her WBC was elevated at 13 and a urinalysis, urine culture
and PA & Lateral chest Xray were repeated.

Her final urine culture was consistent with a yeast infection
and her chest Xray was consistent with a left lower lobe
pneumonia.  She was started on levofloxacin QD for her pneumonia
and diflucan for her yeast infection.

On hospital day 7, patient became delirious overnight with BiPAP
and her systolic blood pressure dropped to 70s to 80s. She was
started on NS at 75cc/hr for a total of 2000cc.

On the morning of hospital day 8, she continued to be delirious
and confused. Her systolic blood pressure remained in 70s to 80s
despite continuous IVF. Her delirium improved over the next 24
hours with treatment of her infections. WBC was elevated but was
trending down on discharge. Pt was never febrile. BP is now
stable.
