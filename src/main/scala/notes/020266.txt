Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Morphine / Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
HEAD BLEED. Presenting complaint of right hand tingling and
mouth tingling.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Bronchoscopy [**2168-7-20**]
Blood transfusions, 4 units
PICC insertion [**2168-7-30**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 59-year-old right-handed woman with a history of
Tangier disease, paraplegia secondary to thoracic cord
compression, and poorly controlled hypertension who presented
with right tongue numbness and arm tingling.  She went to [**Hospital 40576**], where she became increasingly somnolent, had
poor verbal output, and developed significant right-sided
weakness. Head CT showed a 4x3cm L frontal hemorrhage. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  At baseline, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is paraplegic and
wheelchair bound, with significant neuropathy in her upper
extremities and minimal range of motion, but she is cognitively
intact.

She was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**1-24**] following a small
occipital hemorrhage.  MRI and MRA were done at that time, and
it was thought to be due to a pial malformation.  No angiography
was done at that time.  MRI at that time did also show some
evidence of microhemorrhages.  More recently she was
hospitalized from [**6-26**] to [**6-30**] for poorly controlled
hypertension (201 systolic) for which she was started on Diovan
160mg, Norvasc 10mg and HCTZ 12.5mg.  She also briefly required
nitro paste.


Past Medical History:
- hypertension
- paraplegia with indwelling Foley s/p spinal surgery [**9-22**] for
thoracic epidural mass (T11/T12)
- demyelinating neuropathy with bilateral Bell's palsy
- occipital hemorrhage [**1-24**]
- thrombocytopenia
- tangier disease
- AVN of bilateral humeral heads (likely secondary to long-term
steroid use)
- GERD
- depression


Social History:
Has lived in [**Hospital2 34116**] [**Hospital3 **] since [**4-23**].  Health care
proxy is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 29425**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80075**].
- Tobacco Use:remote (1ppd for 30 yrs)
- Alcohol Use: denies
- Recreational Drug Use: denies


Family History:
Parents both died of Alzheimers.  Elder siblings both died of
complications from alcoholism.
There is no history of Tangier disease or stroke.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
.
EKG [**7-17**]: Sinus rhythm 80bpm. Prominent Q waves in leads III and
aVF are new as compared with previous tracing of [**2168-1-21**].
Clinical correlation is suggested. The rate has increased.
.
Head CT [**7-17**]:
FINDINGS: In the left posterior frontal lobe along the high
convexity, there is a 4.5 x 3.5 cm parenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding edema. This is stable from outside hospital CT from
earlier today. There is approximately 4 mm of left to right
midline shift at the level of the left frontal lobe hemorrhage
and there is regional sulcal effacement though no downward
herniation. The lateral ventricles are normal. The frontal
sinuses are not pneumatized. Mastoid air cells are minimally
pneumatized. The osseous structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left frontal lobe parenchymal
hemorrhage
with surrouding edema. The differential diagnosis includes
hemorrhagic stroke versus hemorrhagic mass.
.
L shoulder film [**7-17**]: FINDINGS: Three views of the left shoulder
were obtained. There is sclerosis and deformity of the left
humeral head, compatible with history of prior AVN.  Given the
absence of prior studies for comparison and abnormal appearance
of the glenohumeral joint, evaluation for interval change is
somewhat limited.  The left humeral head does appear to be
slightly inferiorly positioned relative to the glenoid and the
axillary view is suboptimally positioned and therefore
nondiagnostic. The left AC joint appears normal.
.
CXR [**7-18**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**1-23**], there has
been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the distal
stomach. The examination is unchanged except for increased
opacification at the left base with silhouetting of the
hemidiaphragm. Although this could merely reflect left lower
lobe volume loss with pleural fluid, the possibility of
supervening pneumonia would have to be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting.
.
CXR [**7-19**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**7-18**], there is
little change.  Continued increased opacification at the left
base consistent with atelectasis and pleural effusion. Again,
the possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
considered in this region if there are appropriate clinical
symptoms. In addition, there is some ill-defined opacification
in the left perihilar region. This has developed since the most
recent study and is worrisome for developing pneumonia in the
region.
.
CXR [**7-20**]: FINDINGS: Posterior thoracolumbar spinal fusion
hardware is intact and unchanged. An endogastric tube courses
inferiorly and out of the field of view. The heart and
mediastinal contours are unchanged. The hila are normal
appearing bilaterally. Bilateral pleural effusions have
increased from prior study, left greater than right, with
associated atelectais. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous
structures demonstrate near complete destruction of the
bilateral humeral heads.
.
EEG [**7-21**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because
of rare right frontal and left temporal sharp waves which may
represent epileptogenic regions in the cerebral cortex. It is
also abnormal because of left frontal slowing suggestive of
subcortical dysfunction. There was no organized epileptiform
activity or electrographic seizures.
.
Head CT [**7-21**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of large left frontal parenchymal
hemorrhage, with
edema.
2. Minimal interval increase in left sulcal effacement and
rightward
subfalcine herniation now measuring 6 mm, previously 3 mm.
3. No new intracranial hemorrhage.
.
EEG [**7-22**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study because
of left frontal and frontotemporal slowing suggestive of
subcortical dysfunction in these regions and correlates with her
history of intracerebral
hemorrhage. There was no clear epileptiform activity or
electrographic
seizures.
.
EEG [**7-23**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG study
because of left frontal and frontotemporal slowing due to
subcortical dysfunction in these
regions and correlates with her history of intracerebral
hemorrhage.
The bursts of generalized may represent deep midline
dysfunction. There
was no organized epileptiform activity or electrographic
seizures.
