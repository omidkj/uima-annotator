Imaging:

[**7-23**] CXR: Cardiomegaly, mild central congestion. Left lower lobe
atelectasis.

[**7-28**] CXR:
Compared to [**2127-6-10**], both diaphragm contours and the
infrahilar regions of both lungs were clear, there is
opacification in both locations today, not appreciably changed
since [**7-23**]. Whether this is pneumonia or atelectasis or even
early dependent edema is radiographically indeterminate. There
is greater pulmonary vascular engorgement on the current study
than there was on [**6-10**], so there may be a component of cardiac
decompensation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
likely. Severe cardiomegaly and marked hilar dilatation due to
pulmonary arterial hypertension are longstanding. Transvenous
right atrial pacer and right ventricular pacer defibrillator
leads follow their expected courses, unchanged. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
88M with chronic sCHF (EF 25-30%), BiV, COPD and metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma admitted with hypotension and acute on
chronic kidney injury.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Hypotension due to Intravascular Depletion - Differential
included heart failure, intravascular volume depletion [**2-19**] poor
PO intake, and sepsis [**2-19**] possible pneumonia. Pt had no fever,
and a chronically elevated WBC and a CXR without obvious pna.
Intravascular volume depletion from overdiuresis was favored,
and the patient received gentle rehydration and his blood
pressure improved while in the ICU. His SBP on the floor was
~100 while lying. (Please see below for CHF Management)
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Injury Stage [**Name (NI) 25509**] - Pt presented
with Cr 2.0 in setting of diuresis and poor PO intake, baseline
1.2-1.4.  FeNa 1.2%.  Pre-renal vs ATN vs AIN.  Urine
eosinophils were checked and were negative.  Nephrology was
consulted and continued to follow.  His creatine improved during
the hospitalization. Cr was 1.3 at the time of discharge.
.
# Hyponatremia - Thought to be most likely hypovolemic
hyponatremia. Resolved with hydration.

# Chronic Systolic CHF - EF 25%, on lasix/spironolactone with
metolazone weekly.  Currently with some peripheral edema, BNP
elevated at 2600 - recent baseline ~[**2116**]. His beta blocker was
continued, and his ACI-i was held given his acute renal failure.
The patients BiV was reprogrammed during the hospitalization.
Repeat TTE was performed just prior to discharge, final read was
pending at the time of discharge. Of note, this was a sub
optimal study. The patient was continued on Lasix 100mg [**Hospital1 **],
Digoxin and his ACEi. Spirinolactone and Metolazone were held.
**Any questions related to patients hemodynamic status or
diuretics should be directed towards Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**]
(Cardiology) and/or [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]**
**The patient is to follow-up in Cardiology Clinic this coming
Monday**
Weight at the time of discharge is 75.6kg. His SBP is ~100. Cr.
1.3. On room air with sats ~93 with bilateral basilar rales.

# Chronic Leukocytosis - Pt with hx of chronic with
eosinophilia, IgE elevated, ANCA negative, strongy negative.
This was thought to be less likely related to acute infection
given chronic nature.  Cortisol
