History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was re-admitted on [**2172-2-27**] for an altered breathing
pattern on arrival to rehab after being discharged that same

[**Date range (1) 102259**]:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Known firstname 6107**] Sr. is an 85-year-old gentleman with a history
of systolic heart failure (EF 30% on [**2172-2-4**]), atrial
fibrillation, aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8-1.0 cm2), HTN, Burkitt's
lymphoma, who presents with altered mental status and
dehydration. Patient was recently admitted to the CCU for a-fib
with [**Location (un) 5509**], Klebsiella UTI, and altered mental status. His mental
status improved by discharge. He was treated with a course of
antibiotic and was discharged to rehab on metoprolol 125 mg TID.

.
Per Rehab notes and family he had been having episodes of
shortness of breath and agitation that lasted 2-3 minutes. He
was also found very confused in the morning of [**2172-2-18**], A&Ox2
with periods of AMS, restless with HR 110, RR 36, BP 139/98, T
98.7. His metoprolol was increased to QID. Patient finished
today his treatment for UTI. There is no history of cough,
dysuria, frequency, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash. Patinet
has only been mildy constipated (based on medications at Rehab).

.
In the ER patient had TT 97.8 F, BP 149/115, HR 149, RR 28, SpO2
95% on 3 L NC. Patient was wax and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], confused, but was
able to give part of a story. He was found to be on AFib with
[**Doctor Last Name 5509**]. Patient had a head CT scan that did not show intra-craneal
bleed or acute pathology, CXR with mild right pleural effusion
and basal atelectases. Urine analysis was unremarcable, urine
culture pending. EKG did not show any ST-T wave abnormalities.
CEs neg x 2.
.
Patient received almost 2 L of NS with urine output of 600 cc
over 22 hours. His mental status is reportedly improving slowly
with the IVF. He received digoxin 0.125 mg x 1 with HR
decreasing from the 130-140s to 110s. Given his multiple medical
problems and [**Name2 (NI) 28645**] lactate (3.1 from 2.2), he was transferred
to the CCU.
.
Patient had very diffcult access and arrived to the floor with
only a small IV in the left thumb. Pt received 500 cc NS bolus
in the ER. The medical team placed an EJ and PICC was placed on
[**2-19**].

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo man with CHF, AS, afib, multiple recent admissions for
altered mental status, now re-admitted for [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
breathing.

Please see recent discharge summary for history [**Date range (1) 102259**] for
detailed recent medical history.  Patient was re-admitted the
day of discharge for [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.

Altered breathing pattern:  Likely [**Last Name (un) 6055**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] secondary to
congestive heart failure.  At his baseline he has periods of
apnea lasting several seconds but resumes breathing
spontaeneously.  He generally maintained normal O2 sats,
although sometimes dropping into the upper 80s. BiPap was
continued at night.

Altered mental status:  Likely delirium secondary to multiple
recent hospital admissions.  Mental status was unchanged from
prior admission and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].   Generally A&O x 2.

Aortic stenosis:  Patient has known AS with valve area ~1.0 cm2.
 He and his family are considering valvuloplasty for palliation.
 He will follow-up as an outpatient for further consideration.

Atrial fibrillation:  Rate control was improved with titration
of calcium channel blocker and beta blocker.  Rate is generally
90-100.  He will continue anticoagulation with lovenox as long
as he is at rehabilitation.  He and his primary care physician
can decide whether anticoagulation is warranted after that.

CHF:  He was euvolemic this admission.

Elevated liver enzymes:  This was also noted on prior admission.
 It is most likely secondary to poor cardiac pump function
causing hepatic congestion.
