Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 72 year old male with ESRD on HD, diastolic HF,
poorly controlled hypertension, and psoriasis who was BIBA from
home with increasing SOB throughout the day. He had a regularly
scheduled dialysis session on Friday, the day before admission
with about [**2133**] ml fluid removed. During the week, he had noted
increasing orthopnea and coughing when laying flat. He also had
some mild URI symptoms for 2-3 days with nasal congestion and
nonproductive cough but no fevers. The morning of admission, he
forgot to take his BP meds, and became increasingly SOB
throughout day. He is poorly compliant with his diet and ate
pizza with a friend for dinner. His SOB acutely worsened after
dinner, and he used his Lifeline upon arrival home. He was
brought in by EMS. His SPO2 had been in the low 90s on NRB but
improved to mid-90s on CPAP.
.
In the ED, he was afebrile, HR 130s, BP 200/110s, RR 30s, O2 sat
92% on CPAP. Labs were notable for WBC 20.7, bicarb 30,
electrolytes otherwise consistent with ESRD, and Troponin 0.19.
His EKG showed sinus tachycardia with LBBB unchanged from prior.
CXR showed pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, and
opacities likely representing atelectasis, though infection
could not be excluded. He was started on a Nitro drip and given
Lasix 80 mg IV x1, Ceftriaxone 1000 mg IV, Azithromycin, and
Labetolol 10mg IV x1. Renal service was consulted for emergent
dialysis. He was admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **].
.
On arrival to the MICU, initial vitals were HR 92, BP 156/77, O2
sat 98% on Bi-Pap. He stated that his breathing was comfortable
on BiPap. He denies subjective fevers/chills, chest pain,
pleuritic pain, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, melena, or BRBPR. He was taken for emergent
dialysis with about [**2133**] ml fluid removed. After dialysis, he
felt much better with decreased SOB and improvement in his SpO2.
He was weaned off CPAP to face mask oxygen. He was given
Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Levofloxacin for possible HCAP, but
antibiotics were stopped earlier today given his lack of fevers
or sputum production and inconclusive CXR. His Troponin was
trended after admission, and rose from 0.19 on arrival to the
ED, 0.38 several hours later at midnight, and 0.53 at noon
today. He denied chest pain and EKG was unchanged, though
difficult to assess for ischemia given his baseline LBBB.
Dialysis is planned for tomorrow on his usual MWF schedule with
additional fluid removal.
.
When seen prior to floor transfer, he reported feeling much
better, and was sitting comfortably in a chair on 5L NC without
respiratory distress. He denied any current medical complaints.

.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:

Past Medical History:
- Hypertension - sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2204**]. Prior to [**8-4**], was last seen
in [**2138**].
- Chronic Renal Failure: thought to be from hypertension. MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 108084**]-vasculature in [**2133**] showed <50% stenosis of right renal
artery (not thought to be significant/flow limiting). Crt in
[**2138**] was 1.7. Next level is from [**8-4**], when pt found to have crt
of 5 and rising. Worsening renal function thought to be from
uncontrolled HTN. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is pt's nephrologist.
- Hyperlipidemia: Tot Chol 226, Tg 465, LDL 119, HDL 29. Not on

statin
- h/o elevated PSA: last value 3.3 on [**2141-8-16**], up from 2.1 in

[**2134**]


Social History:

insurance & did not see a physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 767**] [**2138**] to [**2141-7-29**]. Pt
quit smoking tobacco >30yr ago. Does not drink ETOH or use
recreational drugs.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. Mother had HTN & renal artery stenosis.

IMAGING:
Portable CXR [**2145-9-25**]:
FINDINGS: There are moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions.
Bibasilar
opacification likely represents effusion and compressive
atelectasis, but
underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Evaluation of the
cardiac
silhouette cannot be performed in the setting of these
opacities. No
pneumothorax is seen on this single view. Calcification of
aortic knob is
noted.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions and opacities likely
representing
efffusions and atelectasis, but underlying consolidation cannot
be excluded.
