Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
Neck mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasopharyngeal mass biopsy

History of Present Illness:
The patient reports progressive hearing loss over the last
several months to a point where he has lost most of his hearing
on the left side. He has also noticed a growing mass on his left
side, numbness & weakness on the right during the same time
period. He also reports weight loss, night-sweats, voice changes
and difficulty swallowing. His family brought him to [**Hospital3 10960**] where he had a CT-scan that showed a nasopharyngeal
mass invading the skull base. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2181-6-15**] - Portable neck soft-tissue: 1. Nasopharyngeal mass with
probable associated skull base invasion though this would be
better assessed with cross-sectional imaging. 2. The nasopharynx
is narrowed but the proximal trachea appears normal. Assessment
for esophageal compression would be more effective with contrast
fluoroscopy or cross-sectional imaging.
.
[**2181-6-5**] - CT-Chest/Ab/Pelvis: 1. 4-mm right middle lobe
pulmonary nodule as seen on [**2181-6-3**]. Given known
nasopharyngeal malignancy, recommend 3-month followup. 2.
Persistent bilateral small pleural effusions. 3. Small
perihepatic ascites. 4. Mild-to-moderate anasarca. 5.
Nonobstructing 2mm left renal stone. 6. Thickening of left
adrenal without nodularity, probably hyperplasia. The study and
the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
.
[**2181-6-5**] - Calcium 11.0
.
[**2181-6-4**] - Tissue immunophenotyping: Non-specific T cell dominant
profile; diagnostic immunophenotypic features of involvement by
non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not seen in specimen.  Correlation with
clinical findings and morphology (see S10-[**Numeric Identifier 8844**]) is recommended.
 Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all lymphomas
due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample preparation.
.
[**2181-6-3**] - Right sided UE US: No evidence of right upper
extremity DVT.
.
[**2181-6-2**] - CT-Head: 1. Massive soft tissue infiltrate at
nasopharynx and nasal passage, extending superiorly to the
sphenoid and ethmoid sinuses. 2. Otherwise, no acute
intracranial process. NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: As above,
there is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or definite vascular
territorial infarction. There is extensive infiltration and bone
destruction of the central skull base by a large mass centered
in the nasopharynx, as above. This transgresses the dorsal
aspect of the clivus but does not appear to involve the
extra-axial compartment or encase the basilar artery, which
enhances normally, on the [**Hospital3 **] Hosp. CECT of [**2181-6-1**].
However, though the ill-defined and vaguely hyperattenuating
material in the region of the left aspect of the prepontine
cistern likely
represents a "tongue" of tumor, thrombus at the left
vertebrobasilar junction is not excluded. There is no definite
evidence of infarction at the pontomedullary junction.

[**2181-6-2**] - Nasopharyngeal mass pathology: Invasive keratinizing
squamous cell carcinoma, moderately to poorly-differentiated.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Neck mass: The patient was on the ENT service and underwent
biopsy in the OR on [**6-2**]. They initially attempted a nasal
approach, but were unsuccessful so they obtained the biopsy
intra-orally. Of note, he was noted to have some ectopy on
telemetry during the case. There were no immediate complications
and the patient was extubated in the PACU.
.
After the procedure he was taken to the PACU and extubated. He
was never fully responsive (not moving any extremities). It was
also noted that he had some agonal breathing. About twenty
minutes later he was unresponsive and apneic. Anesthesia gave
him two doses of narcan with no response. He was re-intubated
(without any sedation) and about 25 minutes later, began to
respond to sternal rub. His mental status improved over time. He
was sent to CT scan but became agitated so he was lightly
sedated again with propofol. CT head was negative for acute
bleed. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
His sedation was weaned and he was extubated at 11 pm that
evening. He was mentating well. He was kept on telemetry and had
no further episodes of ectopy.
.
Pathology of the biopsy showed keratanizing invasive squamous
carcinoma.
.
Radiation-Oncology and Medical-Oncology collaborated to devise
an aggressive chemo-radiation plan with curative intent. The
plan was to involve 5-6 weeks of radiation 5 days a week in
conjunction with a platinum-based chemotherapy. It was also to
involve the placement of a PEG for nutritional support given the
anticipated side effects of treatment, including severe
mucositis.
.
After the patient pulled several intravenous lines and attempted
to leave AMA on multiple occassions, the decision was made to
revisit the patient and family's wishes. A multidisciplinary
meeting was helding involving care providers and health care
professionals from Medical-Oncology, Radiation-Oncology, Ethics,
Case Management, Social Work, Ethics, and Nursing, as well as
the patient's son, who is his proxy. After an extensive
discussion, the patient and his son decided not pursue further
treatment.
.
# PEG tube placement: Prior to the interdisciplinary meeting
discussed above, the patient was scheduled for placement of PEG
in preparation for chemoradiation therapy. Interventional
radiology attempted to place the PEG twice, but were
unsuccessful due anatomic abnormalities prohibiting sufficient
exposure of the stomach radiographically. The patient recovered
without complication from both attempts.
.
# Hypercalcemia: The patient developed hypercalcemia during this
hospitalization, peaking at 11.0. The hypercalcemia was managed
with lasix diuresis and NS IVF repletion and ultimately with
pamidronate. He was discharged with a calcium holding stable
around 8.4.
.
# Leukocytosis: Admitted with a leukocytosis concerning for an
infection; was treated empirically with Vancomycin and Unasyn in
the setting of his nasopharyngeal biopsy. These antibiotics were
stopped once blood cultures were negative x 2 and urine cultures
were negative as well.
.
# Mental status: Prior to the multidisciplinary meeting noted
above, Psychiatry was consulted due to several impulsive bouts
of attempting to leave AMA. He was deemed to lack capacity to
understand fully the implications of leaving to his treatment
plan. His mental status remained stable throughout the
hospitalization, with his impulsivity tapering off in the days
prior to discharge after the multidisciplinary meeting that
culminated in him deciding to not pursue further
