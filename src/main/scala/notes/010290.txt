History of Present Illness:
 54-year-old woman with a history of ILD, COPD, diastolic CHF
(EF 50% in [**2-/2199**]), DM2, PVD s/p R AKA, chronic pancreatitis,
alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred from OSH with pneumonia
and was intubated enroute because of desaturation and agitation.

.
For the past few days the patient has experienced subjective
fevers, chills, chest tightness, and orthopnea. She presented to
[**Hospital3 **] today, was diagnosed with pneumonia and CHF
exacerbation (BNP > 35,000). She was started on moxifloxacin and
given furosemide 40 mg IV x 1 for presumed CHF exacerbation as
well as IV steroids. Reportedly her respiratory status improved
after the furosemide. There was some mentioning of her being
started on a heparin gtt for presumed PE in the [**Location (un) **] chart
