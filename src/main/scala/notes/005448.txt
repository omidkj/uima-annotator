Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
56 yo M with history of HIV, ESRD on HD presents with dyspnea
and hypoxemia after recent travel to [**State 108**]. Denies any sick
contacts there. [**Name2 (NI) **] was in airport on evening prior to
presentation and had sudden onset of dyspnea prior to boarding
the plan. Was told he had a low oxygen sat and was put on
supplemental oxygen on the plane. Was not feeling well last
night and thus stayed at his sister's house. He slept well
overnight, but awoke in the morning with dyspnea. Went to
dialysis today they took off an extra 1.5 kg of volume. Denies
feeling fevers, though having intermittent dry cough.
.
Upon arrival to the ED vitals were: T 99, HR 106, BP 136/98, RR
18, O2Sat 96% 6L. Was noted to be hypoxemic at presentation to
ED. Had CXR with bilateral infiltrates. Received levofloxacin.
Obtained CTA chest to rule out pulmonary embolism and no PE was
noted, but CT preliminarily read as multiple ground glass
opacities consistent with infection. Patient given 3 Bactrim DS
tablets for empiric cdiff treatment. Vitals prior to transfer to
the MICU were: T 99.6, HR 110, BP 121/81, RR 20, O2Sat 93% 10L
FM.

.
CTA Chest ([**2160-3-25**]):
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or acute aortic pathology.
2. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, right greater than
left with multiple nodular opacities. These findings are most
compatible with an infectious etiology.
3. Moderate hiatal hernia with fluid in the esophagus.
.
AXR, Portable ([**2160-3-31**]):
Air is seen in non-dilated loops of small bowel. No
free air is seen. The structures are grossly unremarkable. There
is a
moderate-to-large volume of urine in the bladder. IMPRESSION: No
free air.
.
Portable CXR ([**2160-3-31**]):
1. Increased pulmonary edema. Underlying infectious process is
not well
evaluated in the setting of this edema.
2. Tracheal deviation to the right. Evaluation with PA
radiograph is
recommended if patient is clincally able.
.
CT Head ([**2160-3-31**]):
1. Extensive white matter hypodensities could be related to
chronic small
vessel ischemic disease if the patient has the appropriate risk
factors,
specifically hypertension and/or diabetes. Otherwise, given the
patient's
history of HIV, these white matter hypodensities could be
explained by HIV
encephalopathy or another immunocompromise related to infectious
process.
Recommend clinical correlation.
2. Lacune in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule.
3. Global cerebral atrophy.
.
EEG ([**2160-4-1**]):
Abnormal routine EEG due to the presence of a
disorganized [**7-1**] Hz theta rhythm background seen during the most
awake
portions of the tracing with frequent generalized suppressive
burst
activity. This is consistent with a mild to moderate diffuse
encephalopathy. In addition, there are occaisonal sharp and slow

wave discharges occuring mostly over the right frontocentral
region, and
occasionally in a generalized distribution with a left sided
predominance, suggestive of a focal and a generalized cortical
irritability. However, there were no electrographic seizures
seen.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] Without Contrast ([**2160-4-1**]):
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
2. There is extensive periventricular and subcortical white
matter FLAIR
hyperintensities likely representing the sequela of chronic
small vessel
ischemic disease. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
infarction.
3. Bilateral mastoid sinus fluid/mucosal thickening, right
greater than left.
.
CXR ([**2160-4-2**]):
The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been
removed. No focal parenchymal opacities have newly occurred.
There are no major pleural effusions. Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly without evidence of pulmonary edema. Mild
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. A remnant opacity in the right
upper lobe that has decreased in size since the previous
examination needs attention at future followups.
