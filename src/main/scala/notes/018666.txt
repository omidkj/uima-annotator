Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
Left Empyema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2180-3-27**] Left thoracoscopy and partial decortication of left
lung.
[**2180-3-30**] Flexible bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with an approximately 12 cm
loculated empyema in the left chest. He was treated initially
with a chest tube that evacuated
over a liter of frank pus. A post chest tube CT scan
demonstrated markedly improved expansion of the left lung but
there were some residual fluid collections within the pleural
space. He was taken to the operating room for
debridement and decortication. Preoperatively, we reviewed the
risks of the operation with the patient and his sister. We
discussed the risk of bleeding, reoperation, recurrence of the
pleural effusion and death.

CXR:
[**2180-3-31**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-29**], the
right IJ catheter has been removed. Post-surgical changes are
again seen on the left with two chest tubes in place. Little
overall change in the extent of the left pleural thickening or
residual effusion.
Chest CT [**2180-3-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked decrease in the size of multiloculated left pleural
fluid
collections following placement of a left pleural drain. Small
amount of
loculated fluid and extensive pleural thickening persists.
2. Slight interval increase in the size of pericardial effusion.
These
findings should be closely followed clinically for the
possibility of
developing tamponade physiology.
3. Persistent left lobe dependent consolidation.
4. Mild gallbladder mural thickening. Would correlate this
finding to
physical examination for upper abdominal pain. If absent, could
correlate to an outpatient abdominal ultrasound
[**2180-3-29**] Renal US:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
2. No significant ascites is seen.
3. Multiple gallbladder calculi and moderately thickened
gallbladder wall as identified on prior ultrasound scan
[**2180-3-24**].


Brief Hospital Course:
54M admitted on [**2180-3-24**] from the ED after as a transfer from
[**Hospital3 3583**] ED where he was found to have six weeks of
fatigue, decreased energy. At [**Hospital1 18**] he was found to have a
leukocytosis and on CT had a large left sided empyema occupying
>50% of the left chest cavity. He was immediately started on
Vanc and Zosyn and on HD 2 he underwent placement of a left
sided pigtail catheter with the immediate outflow of thick pus >
1L. The patient did complain of some abdominal pain and was
found to have cholelithiasis with thickening of the gallbladder
wall on ultrasound, but there was no intrahepatic or
extrahepatic biliary dilatation. An MRCP was performed because
of the ultrasound findings and the patient's elevated biliruben
to 3.4 at the time of admission, but his pain had begun to
subside by HD 2 and his LFTs were all down trending. There was
much less of a concern for acute cholecystitis. He was otherwise
stable and tolerating a regular diet.

On HD 3 a repeat CT of the chest confirmed that much of the
empyema had drained but there was a persistent left lobe
dependent consolidation and and extensive pleural thickening.

On HD 4 he was taken to the operating room for a L VATS
decortication, washout and chest tube placement. This procedure
went well without surgical complication; for more information
please see separate op note. During extubation the patient did
become agitated and resultantly pulled out his IV access and
dislodged the ET tube. The tube was promptly replaced but
becuase the patient remained agitated, IM sedation was given
including 5mg midazolam and 60mg ketamine. He was also
hypertensive into the 200s systolic and given 10 labetolol. A
central line was placed in the PACU and the patient remained
intubated. His pressures then began to drift downward with MAPs
60-65. He was then started on phenylephrine drip up to
2mcg/kg/min. He was transferred to the ICU for monitoring,
weaning of the pressors and respiratory managment. Overnight POD
0 he required a 500cc bolus of LR and 250 of 5% albumin as his
Urine output was borderline low.

On the morning of POD 1 he was alert, responsive to commands and
down on his pressor to 0.8mcg/kg/min of phenylephrine. At 5pm
his pressors were weaned off and he was extubated without event.
He was comfortable and tolerating a regular diet
On POD 2 he transferred to the floor.  Renal was consulted for
ATN pk CRE 3.1 base 0.8. They felt his acute renal failure was
secondary to ischemic ATN during his period of hypotension
requiring pressors.

His creatinine continued to improve and on POD#5 it was 2.4. It
was decided that since the patient had no insurance and was
paying out of pocket for his hospital stay that it would be ok
to discharge him home. The nephrology team was comfortable with
sending him home with a Cr of 2.4 as well as long as the patient
was set for follow-up soon after discharge where a chem panel
could be checked. Therefore, his chest tubes were switched out
for pneumostats. He and his sister received [**Name2 (NI) 84856**] teaching
and home VNA was set up for him since he started an application
for Mass Health.

On the day of discharge, he was afebrile with stable vital
signs. He was tolerating a regular diet. He had no complaints of
pain, shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain. He was able to
get out of bed and ambulate independently.
