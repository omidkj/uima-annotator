Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8961**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD line placement and dialysis initiation

History of Present Illness:
41 y/o M with hx of HIV, stage 4 CKD secondary to MPGN, severe
HTN, with recent admission for ruptured [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst / LE edema,
presents with worsening bilateral LE edema since prior
discharge, shortness of breath for the past 4 days, [**10-31**]
non-radiating constant sharp substernal/epigastric pain,
non-productive cough x1 day, nausea, 2 episodes of non-bilious
vomiting with small specks of blood, subjective fevers and
chills x 1 day.
.
In the ED, the patient was noted to have BP of 199/99. CXR was
conistent with pulmonary edema. The patient was given Morphine,
Nitro paste, 40mg IV Lasix, Hydralazine. CT scan of chest was
performed which revealed bilateral pleural effusions and likely
atelectasis, but possible PNA at right lower lobe. The patient
was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime for empiric treatment of
HAP. After SBP returned to 170s, the patient received clonidine
and morphine and a second dose of [**1-24**] inch nitro paste. Vital
signs of transfer included BP in 150s and HR in 70s.
.
He was admitted to the floor and treated for HAP with vanco and
cefepime. Had been diuresed with a total of 40 mg IV lasix x2
and his I/Os were about negative 300 cc. The night of admission,
he had several small episodes of coffee ground emesis. NG lavage
on the floor was negative. Hct remained stable. In the early
morning prior to transfer to MICU, he was hypertensive with SBPs
to the 200s. He was complaining of headache. EKG was without
changes. He was treated with his home BP meds and 60 mg IV
hydral in several boluses.
.
Patient's blood pressure did not improve so he was transfered to
MICU. On transfer, vitals T 99.8, Tm 100.6, BP 199/108
(152/82-231/115), P 94 (73-98), R 18, 96% on RA. He looked
uncomfortable, was sitting up in bed and looked worse when lying
down.
.
In the MICU, he was poorly controlled on a nitro drip but his
BPs improved with a labetolol drip and his headache resolved.
His Hct went down to 19.7 and he got 1unit PRBCs with a rise to
22.0.  He had a head CT that showed a new hypodensity along the
left periventricular white matter. However, the findings could
represent an old insult such as old infarct. Because he was
completely intact neurologically and his headache had resolved,
an LP was not pursued. Eventually the patient was put back on
his home BP regimen and transferred back to the floor.

[**2128-4-21**] LENI: No DVT in the left lower extremity.
[**2128-4-21**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. An enlarged upper and lower lobe arteries with signs of
blood flow
redistribution and cardiomegaly. Minimal left pleural effusion.
No newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. No
lung nodules or masses.
[**2128-4-19**] MRI w/o: Encephalomalacia within the left corona radiata
with associated hemosiderin staining, new since [**2126**], without
any acute infarct component. The findings likely represent a
chronic infarction with hemorrhagic transformation or sequela of
a previous hypertensive hemorrhage. While evaluation for
intracranial infection is limited in the absence of intravenous
contrast, there are no findings to suggest an infection.
[**2128-4-19**] Abd u/s: 1. Patent hepatic vasculature. No thrombosis
identified.
2. No liver lesions identified. 3. Small amount of gallbladder
sludge. Thickened gallbladder wall is likely due to underlying
disease. 4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
[**2128-4-17**] CT head w/o: 1. Tiny rounded hypodensity in the right
caudate head is unchanged, previously thought to represent
subacute or chronic infarct (MRI [**2126-1-30**]). 2. Since [**2126-11-14**],
there is new hypodensity along the left periventricular white
matter. Given what appears to be ex vacuo dilatation along the
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, findings may
represent old insult such as old in
