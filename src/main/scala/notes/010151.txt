History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 122**] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 87 YO M with end-stage
diastolic heart faillure (EF 65%), moderate AS, mild AI, mild
MR, moderate TR, HTN, HL, Stage IV CKD, positive HIT antibody
(negative seronotin assay), recent episode of c diff who comes
with somnolence. Patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] after a hip
fracture 11 days ago to [**Hospital **] Rehab, where he was noted by his
wife to be somnolent, bed-bound, with poor apetite. Lab work on
[**4-17**] showed Tbili: 26, Dbili: 14, AST 101, ALT 31, Alk phos:
644, which was thought to be secondary to either medication (PO
Vanc) versus other pathology. Patient has extensive work up
including ceruloplasmin, alpha1 anti-tripsin, AMA, anti-smooth
muscle, [**Doctor First Name **], hepatitis cerologies Ca [**49**]-9 and everything was
negative except [**Doctor First Name **], which were mildy positive at 1:40.
Initially it was decided to undergo liver biopsy for diagnosis,
but after discussion with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 696**] it was decided it
was too high risk.
.
Today he was evaluated by ortho in a normal scheduled post-op
visit. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] was pleased with the results and he removed
the staples (per wife). He was on his way back home, when he was
found somnolent and BP was very difficult to take as well as
pulse. So he was brought to the ER.
.
In the ER his initial VS were: T 98.4, HR 54 X', BP 134/93 mmHg,
SpO2 100% on RA. His BP dropped to 81/57 and did not respond to
2 L NS, so he was started on peripheral norepinephrine. He wa
safebrile and with HR in 50s to 60s. Physical exam reported CTA
lung fields, normal JVP. ECG was unchanged from prior. CT scan
of the head did not show any acute bleed or pathology, CT
abdomen showed anasarca, but no signs of infection, CT chest no
PNA and worsening effusions. His WBC was 6, LFTs were unchanged
from [**4-17**] at OSH and slightly worsened compared to prior at
[**Hospital1 18**]. Pt received levofloxacin for possible UTI? and was
admitted to the ICU given his multiple medical comorbidities.

Past Medical History:
-Congestive heart failure with preserved LVEF (65% 1/10) --> per
DCS from [**2-8**], thought to have left HF leading to right HF
without primary pulm HTN
-Chronic Atrial fibrillation, not on warfarin given recent UGIB
([**2-8**])
-Pulmonary artery hypertension (30mmHg + RA [**11-6**])
-Mild MR, moderate TR, mild AI, mild AS (peak 25 mmHg [**11-6**])
-Mild ascending aortic dilatation (3.7 cm)
-Left ventricular hypertrophy
-Prostate enlargement (followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 79**])
-Hypertension
-Hypercholesterolemia
-Severe essential tremor, since [**2076**] (WWII)
-Venous stasis, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) 104985**] hernia repair
-Anemia, multifactorial (chronic illness, CKD, recent GIB)
-Hemorrhoid repair
-History of MRSA cellulitis ([**2-7**])
-Chronic Renal Failure [**1-31**] poor forward flow from CHF: Stage IV
with eGFR of 24 ml/min (MDRD). Near dialysis. Recommend to check
PTH every 3 months with target of 70-110.
-Left foot abscess s/p I&D
-Multiple episodes of C. Diff colitis (third episode this year
during [**3-17**] hospitalization)
-GIB ([**2141-3-17**]) with guaiac positive stools, but no endoscopy
performed
.
Recent hospitalizations:
[**2140-12-29**] to [**2141-1-4**]
-- for CHF exacerbation, given lasix ggt
-- left foot cellulitis/fluid collection managed medically with
Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl
-- AFib subtherapeutic on Coumadin so bridged with Heparin with
subsequent rectal bleeding, traumatic hematoma, oozing from
newly placed PICC line
-- incidentaloma seen in pancreas on RUQ u/s without further w/u
.
[**2141-1-31**] to [**2141-2-15**]
-- also for CHF exacerbation, given lasix ggt and metolazone
-- supratherapeutic INR on admission, complicated by epistaxis
and melena (GI followed but endoscopy was deferred)
-- C diff colitis treated with ? both Po flagyl and vancomycin,
course should have been completed [**2141-2-19**]
.
[**2141-3-7**] to [**2141-3-10**]
-- Unresponsive while sleeping after trazadone; negative
infectious work up
-- 16 beat run of VT
-- Decreased metoprolol from 12.5mg->6.25mg [**Hospital1 **]
-- Renal failure attributed to torsemide and pre-renal
.
[**2141-3-17**] to [**2141-3-31**]
-- Sent in by rehab for sleepiness, low Hct, weight gain, cough.
-- C. Diff colitis
-- GIB (Guaiac positive, had been on coumadin until [**Month (only) 956**]
when had presumed UGIB requiring 1U pRBC); transfused for Hct
23.5 (but near baseline of 24)
-- Hypotension to the 70s systolic (baseline 90-100s)
-- CHF
-- UTI
-- Acute on chronic kidney disease
-- Pancytopenia: found to be HIT antibody positive but serotonin
assay negative so not likely HIT; nonetheless heparin products
were avoided. Pancytopenia improved over hospital course;
thought to be infection related.
-- Increased AP and GGT with elevated lipase and an abnormality
on ultrasound suggestive of a pancreatic mass. GI was consulted
and recommended an outpatient MRCP.
.

[**2141-4-6**] to [**2141-4-14**]
-- Hypotension: Most likely due to combination of dehydration
+/- acute bleed in setting of poor cardiac function. Responded
to fluids.
-- Hip fracture: s/p ORIF with TFN
-- Acute on chronic renal failure
-- LFTs: direct>indirect with elevated alk phos, however no
evidence of obstruction on US. Seen by liver. Work up was
pending on discharge.
-- CHF
-- RETROPERITONEAL MASS: Adrenal mass seen on CT this admission
(8x6.2 cm). Plan was work up as outpatient.
-- Thrombocytopenia: initial concern for HIT, but r/o with
negative serotonin assay. Avoiding heparin anyway.

IMAGING:
CT Head ON [**2141-4-25**]:
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation abnormality. Prominence of the sulci and
ventricles is consistent with age related global atrophy.
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are
compatibl
