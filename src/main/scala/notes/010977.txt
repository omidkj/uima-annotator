History of Present Illness:
Patient intubated and sedated; history obtained from medical
record and from daughter.

82 y/o woman with PMH porcine valve, a. fib on Coumadin, who
was
in her usual state of health until this morning, when she was
found down on her knees. She was awake and verbal at that time.
She was taken to OSH; CT head there showed SAH and INR of 6. She
was given 2 units FFP, 10 mg Vitamin K, loaded with Keppra 500
mg
IV and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Just prior to arrival to
ED, she became somnolent and was intubated for airway
protection.
On arrival here, her INR was 1.8. By report, prior to her
intubation and sedation, her R pupil was 4-->3 and her left
pupil
was 3-->2; she was squeezing with her right hand, but nothing
else.

Past Medical History:
- afib on coumadin
- CHF
- HTN
- hypothyroidism
- bilateral knee replacements

Imaging:
CTA Head [**11-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. No definite hydrocephalus is
seen. A
blood clot is visualized in the interhemispheric region.
2. A 9 x 8 mm irregular pericallosal artery aneurysm is
identified pointing anteriorly. No other aneurysms are seen.
There is mild diffuse vasospasm of the vascular structure seen
which slightly limit the evaluation. Vascular calcifications are
seen.

Angio [**11-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
Diagnostic cerebral angiogram demonstrates a 9.5 x 9.5 x 4.5 mm
pericallosal aneurysm identified as the source of subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
GDC platinum coils were used during the procedure.
Successful coil embolization of the pericallosal aneurysm with
residual subtle filling in the posterior aspect, likely to get
thrombosed over the next few days. A repeat followup angiogram
is advised in a weeks time.

CT Head [**11-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval coiling of an anterior cerebral artery aneurysm
since [**2200-11-16**].
2. Interval placement of a right frontal approach
ventriculostomy tube,
likely malpositioned with tip traversing past the midline into
the
contralateral aspect of the suprasellar cistern. Insufficient
functioning of this drain is evidenced by overall dramatically
increased amount of blood product within the ventricles and
cisterns diffusely as compared to [**2200-11-16**].
3. Increased blood products within the suprasellar and basilar
cisterns,
which likely remain somewhat patent. No definite evidence of
hydrocephalus.  Significant interval increase of amount of blood
within the interhemispheric region and within the lateral
ventricles and cisterns. Recommend adjustment of the catheter

CT Head [**11-18**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of new hemorrhage since [**2200-11-16**]. Stable
position of right frontal approach ventriculostomy tube with tip
in the left frontal lobe. No increased mass effect. ACA aneurysm
status post coiling.

CT Head [**11-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post right ACA aneurysm coiling with unchanged large
hematoma
involving the corpus callosum extending to the ventricle.
2. Right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged
in position.

CTA Head [**11-24**]:
Status post right ACA aneurysm coiling. Right frontal approach
ventriculostomy catheter crosses the midline and the tip
terminates in the left frotal lobe unchanged from prior studies
([**2200-11-18**]). Stable large hematoma in the corpus callosum with
blood extending to both occipital horns. Stable extensive
subarachnoid hemorrhage. COW patent pending reformations.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 87926**] was seen and evaluated in the emergency
department for SAH on [**11-16**]. Her INR was elevated, so she
received Vit K, FFP and Prophiline for reversal. An EVD was
emergently placed.  She was admitted to the TSICU on the NSurg
service.  A CTA was performed and it showed that the SAH was due
to rupture of a pericollosal artery aneurysm. That afternoon,
she was taken to the angio lab for coiling of the pericallosal
artery aneurysm. She was on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

On [**11-17**] her CPP and SBP were markedly low, and therefore
pressors were started.  ICP was elevated to 50, so she received
IV Mannitol. The EVD was set at 15mm H20.  For the next several
days, her neuro exam worsened.  She had minimally reactive
pupils, without eye opening or commands.  She had weak
localization of her UE, and triple flexion of lowers.  Her exam
remained unchanged through the weekend of [**11-22**]-7. Her CT scans
remained stable.

A family meeting was called on [**11-24**], and given the patient's
poor prognosis, the decision was made to make the patient CMO.
Her EVD was pulled, and she was extubated in the afternoon of
[**11-24**].  She expired on [**2200-11-25**] at 0045.
