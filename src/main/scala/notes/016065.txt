Worsening shortness of breathx 6 months

Core valve placement

pulmonary intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 66 year old woman with multiple medical
problems including CAD s/p DES to RCA in [**2172-11-28**], severe
aortic stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2), recent DVT treated with
coumadin, and SLE who is transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] CCU
for evaluation of severe aortic stenosis earlier this year.
.
Her cardiac history dates to [**2172-11-28**] for SOB when
diagnosed with severe CHF and aortic stenosis. She also
underwent a cardiac catherization at [**Hospital1 3278**] during that
admission, and had a DES placed to the RCA, which was
complicated by acute renal failure in the setting of contrast
load. She was deemed to be an
inoperable candidate by the cardiac surgeons at [**Hospital1 3278**].
.
She then presented to the [**Hospital3 3583**] ED on [**2173-2-20**] after
several days of increasing cough productive of sputum, fevers,
and worsening SOB. She was admitted to the CCU and treated for a
pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics,diuresed with lasix
gtt and developed acute renal failure (Cre1.9->3.3->2.3)renal
thought it was secondary to diuresis versus worsening aortic
stenosis and less likely lupus nephritis given negative
complement.
.
During her hospitalization in early [**Month (only) 547**], she was seen in
consultation with the [**Hospital1 18**] (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] cardiac surgery service
who deemed her an Extreme Risk surgical candidate due to
porcelain aorta. Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**] later concurred in his
findings.
.
She was re-admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2173-3-21**] with
worsening of her shortness of breath and suspicion of pneumonia
secondary to her immunocompromised status.  She was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment of her CHF.
.
Due to her worsening renal function (creatinine = 3.3 mg/dl),
left and right heart diastolic heart failure, and shortness of
breath, balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed on [**2173-3-25**] with a 22 mm and 23 mm aortic valvuloplasty balloons
without complications.  The final aortic valve area was 0..86
cm2.
.
Following BAV, she symptoms improved and her creatinine fell to
1.8 mg/dL.  She mobilized over 1 kg of fluid in a 24 hour
period. Her dyspnea is substantially improved.  She was
discharged to home on daily furosemide.
.
She was readmitted [**4-12**] for CTA to complete her workup. Her
renal function remained stable.
.
She has continuted to have NYHA Class III symptoms with
exertion.

EKG [**5-17**]: Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy with
secondary repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2173-4-14**] the findings are similar.
.
[**5-18**]: ECHO Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal. A mild to
moderate ([**11-29**]+) paravalvular aortic valve leak is present. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normally-seated CoreValve aortic prosthesis with
mild to moderate paravalvular leak. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-3-26**],
severely stenotic native aortic valve has been replaced with a
CoreValve prosthesis.
.
[**5-18**] CXR: In comparison with study of [**5-17**], CoreValve is now in
place in the aorta. No evidence of pneumothorax or acute
pneumonia or definite pulmonary vascular congestion. Right IJ
pacer extends to the region of the apex of the right ventricle.
.
[**6-3**] Gastric Motility Test: Normal esophageal motility, limited
study.
.
[**5-28**] LUE U/S 1. Resolution of previously visualized DVT in one of
the two brachial veins with no evidence of residual DVTs in the
left upper extremity. 2. Left axillary hematoma with expected
evolutionary changes.
.
[**5-21**] LUE U/S 1. Deep vein thrombosis seen within one of the two
brachial veins. Normal flow is seen in the remainder of the
veins of the left arm.
2. Left axillary hematoma, which appears slightly smaller on
today's exam,
although note is made that a different technique was used.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old female with critical aortic stenosis s/p coreValve
percutaneous aortic valve replacement with a 26 mm CoreValve
with course complicated by left arm and left groin hematoma,
hypopharyngeal laceration which was sutured and hypotension
requiring pressors.
