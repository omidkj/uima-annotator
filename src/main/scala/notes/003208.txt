Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line placement and subsequent removal
hemodialysis line removal


History of Present Illness:
70 yo M presented to ED from nursing home w/ altered mental
status and low grade fever.  Per the patient's son, patient's
penile gangrene had worsened - prior dry gangrene isolated to
glans penis treated conservatively given not operative candidate
and followed closely by urology. On evaulation in the ED patient
was oriented only to self.

In the ER initial VS were: T 100.6 HR 53 BP 135/67 RR 14. VS
prior to transfer to the ICU 86, BP 146/65 98% on 2L RR 12. He
rec'd 20u sc insulin in total, he rec'd 500cc of IVF. Had a L SC
CVL placed.

He was transferred to the MICU for concern of sepsis.  CT groin
showed sq air diagnostic for fournier's gangrene. He was treated
with vanc/zosyn/cipro and urology was consulted who had a long
discussion with son about patient not being an operative
candidate and the natural course of fournier's gangrene without
surgical intervention.  Decision made to make patient DNR/DNI
with no escalation of care.  Patient was hemodynamically stable
throughout MICU course.

He was transferred to the floor and upon evaluation patient
denied pain, CP, SOB, abd pain or other ROS.

Pertinent Results:
CT A/P:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive subcutaneous and soft tissue emphysema involving
essentially all compartments of the penis extending its entire
length, consistent with
Fournier's gangrene. Emergent surgical evaluation is
recommended.
2. Extensive diffuse atherosclerotic disease, with possible
right proximal
superficial femoral artery occlusion as described. Please
correlate
clinically for further evaluation. Current study is not tailored
for CT
angiography.
3. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with
compressive
atelectasis, right greater than left.
4. High-density exophytic small lower pole right renal lesion,
new since
[**2160**], is not fully characterized. This may be further evaluated
by ultrasound on a non-emergent basis.
5. Diffuse severe anasarca.
6. Fat-containing umbilical hernia.
7. Moderate amount of fecal material throughout the colon.

CT HEAD:
No intracranial hemorrhage, large vascular territory infarct, or

large mass. Please note MRI with gadolinium is superior for
evaluation of
intracranial mass if not contraindicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 70 year old male with  h/o DM, HTN, ESRD on
HD and systolic CHF EF 30% presented with altered mental status,
fever, found to have Fourniers gangrene of the groin.  He was
septic and started on Vanco/Zosyn/Clindamycin in the ICU. The
patient was a high surgical risk, and any survival and per
urology the benefit to be obtained from debridement would likely
be small and associated with significant pain and painful
dressing changes.  He was continued on antibiotics and an
aggressive pain regimen.  This alleviated his symptoms.  His
mental status also cleared as his pain control improved.  He was
hemodynamically stable and he was tranferred to the floor where
further discussion regarding goals of care were pursued with the
assitance of the palliative care team.  During a family meeting,
it was made clear that the patient's Fournier's gangrene was
non-operative and was terminal.  Following this discussion with
[**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, son [**Name (NI) 14175**], the decision was made
that the patient would want his care to be focused at home with
hospice without return to a health care facility if his
condition worsened.  Hemodialysis was discontinued, and his HD
line was removed.  Hospice care was arranged, and the patient
was discharged on [**2165-3-20**] home with hospice.  He had a mid-line
placed so that he could continue to receive antibiotics for his
non-operative Fournier's gangrene.  Pain control was optimized
with a fentanyl patch and sublingual morphine.  The patient was
comfortable and alert upon discharge.
