HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 57 year old male
resident of nursing home with a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease on supplemental oxygen at four
liters nasal cannula, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
status post left below the knee amputation and right above
the knee amputation, who presents with worsening shortness of
breath times nine hours.  The patient is a very poor
historian but denies any fever, chills, sweats, chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or urgency.  He denied
any new cough and no sputum production.

In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have oxygen
saturation of 50% in room air which improved to 70% on five
liters, 87% on 100% nonrebreather mask.  His shortness of
breath symptomatically improved with the oxygen.  He was
given Lasix 40 mg intravenous in the Emergency Department
with 1800 ccs of urine output and decreased FIO2 to 10 liters
with oxygen saturation to 90%.  He was additionally given
Solu-Medrol 125 mg intravenous and Levaquin in the Emergency
Department.  Chest angiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolus.  He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further care.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a resident of a nursing home.
Positive forty pack year history of tobacco.  He denies any
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission revealed
temperature 99.0, blood pressure 104/69, pulse 102,
respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 87% on 100%
nonrebreather mask.  Generally, he is a middle age man in
moderate respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat - The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Mucous
membranes are slightly dry.  Sclera anicteric.  Neck - There
is no jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.  The
neck is supple without any palpable masses.  The lungs
revealed distant breath sounds bilaterally, no crackles, no
wheezes or rales.  Cardiovascular examination - regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive
bowel sounds. There is no hepatomegaly.  Extremities - right
above the knee amputation and a left below the knee
amputation with no edema and moves all four extremities
spontaneously. Neurologically, he is alert and oriented times
three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  Motor
examination is grossly normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count is 7.6, hematocrit
44.0, platelets 199,000.  Sodium 134, potassium 3.8, chloride
102, bicarbonate 20, blood urea nitrogen 16, creatinine 0.7,
glucose 249.  INR 1.1, prothrombin time 13.1, partial
thromboplastin time 26.3.  Urinalysis showed moderate blood,
no nitrites, trace protein, negative glucose, negative
ketone, 3 red blood cells, 20 white blood cells, few bacteria
and no yeast.  Arterial blood gases was done with pH 7.44,
pCO2 34, pO2 66.

CT angiogram of the chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism, diffuse increased interstitial markings with patchy
areas of ground glass opacifications most pronounced at the
bases.  Compared to the prior study, it appears to be
somewhat accentuated.  The patient has a baseline chronic
lung disease likely consistent with an emphysematous pattern
as well as possible fibrotic changes at the lung bases.  Line
with reflux into the inferior vena cava.  Most likely
diagnosis is congestive heart failure.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 105 beats per
minute, left axis deviation, right bundle branch block,
normal intervals, no ST segment changes, no Q waves and there
were no changes from his electrocardiogram from [**2150-3-26**].

The patient had a blood culture from [**2150-11-1**], that showed
enterococcus as well as coagulase positive Staphylococcus
aureus that was Methicillin resistant.  Enterococcus was
sensitive to Vancomycin.  There were four out of four blood
cultures that were positive including two that were drawn
from his port-a-cath and two that were drawn peripherally.
Urine culture was negative.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral coarse interstitial pattern,
mild progression since [**3-26**], no consolidation or effusion,
stable cardiac and mediastinal contours.

Lower extremity Doppler showed normal evaluation in the
common femoral, superficial femoral vessels bilaterally.  No
evidence of a deep vein thrombosis although the popliteal
vein on the left was not visualized.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 57 year old male with a history
of severe lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and interstitial lung disease, diabetes mellitus, who
presents with hypoxic respiratory distress and initially
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Pulmonary - The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit from the Emergency Department for further
care.  The patient was felt to be in hypoxic respiratory
distress secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.  Pulmonary embolus was ruled out in the
Emergency Department with a chest CT angiogram.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he was continued on
Solu-Medrol at 125 mg intravenous q6hours and was continued
at that dose for the first 72 hours.  In the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, he continued to receive Albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers q2hours.  He was also initially started
on Levaquin for coverage of a possible pneumonia associated
with his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as his chest
x-ray showed increased interstitial infiltrate.

On hospital day two, however, the patient became tachycardic,
tachypneic and hypotensive with decreasing oxygen saturation.
This was thought to be due to sepsis as his blood cultures
came back four out of four bottles positive for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin.  His
respiratory status improved and he was gradually weaned off
the 100% nonrebreather to face mask and then transferred to
the Medicine floor on hospital day five.

While on the Medicine floor, he has continued to receive
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers q4hours and his Solu-Medrol
was switched to p.o. Prednisone with plans to taper gradually
over three weeks to his regular dose of 5 mg Prednisone q.d.
The patient has a baseline oxygen requirement and while he
was on the Medicine floor, his oxygen requirement was
titrated to keep his oxygen saturation around the high 80s to
low 90s.  On discharge, the patient was on five liters of
nasal cannula oxygen with oxygen saturation in the low 90s.

2.  Cardiovascular - The patient has a history of coronary
artery disease and previous inferior myocardial infarction.
He initially denied any chest pain on admission and
electrocardiogram was similar to his prior electrocardiogram
in [**2150-3-26**].  He was continued on his Aspirin and Lipitor
on admission.  However, on hospital day, he became
hypotensive, tachycardic and tachypneic with decreasing
oxygen saturation.

He was initiated on Levophed to keep his blood pressure
elevated.  His hypotension
