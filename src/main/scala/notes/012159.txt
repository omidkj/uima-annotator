History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is an 81 y/o STR resident with a h/o CAD, CHF who
was brought to [**Hospital3 **] after complaining of
epigastric pain associated with nausea and vomiting of bright
red bloody emesis. In addition, the patient was noted to be
hypothermic to 93F, as well as minimally responsive when EMS
arrived on the scene, cold, clammy, and was witnessed to have
vomited approximately a cup of "coffee ground red vomit" per
EMS. Per son; he had taken patient out during the day, returning
around 4pm at which time he was tired and took a nap. Later on
he was more lethargic and fell asleep easily; then vomited
watery blood around 7pm.
The patient had been seen the week prior in the ED for
hyponatremia, where he was placed briefly on a 1L fluid
restriction. At that time, he was also given a course of Avelox
for a presumed PNA? Per patient's son; 2 weeks ago he had 10 day
long admission for pneumonia and UTI; previously living at home
with son but following this admission patient went to short term
rehab due to deconditioning.
Per the OSH, the patient was hypotensive upon initial
presentation with SBP's in the 50's and HCT of 20. The patient
was then intubated in the setting of his hypovolemic shock,
requiring Levophed for blood pressure support and shortly
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his GIB.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo man w/ h/o CAD, recent PNA, who was transferred with
hypotension and hematemesis.

# Shock: Patient with reported systolic BP's in the 50's at OSH
upon initial presentation requiring Levophed for BP support &
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on Levophed. Hypotension likely related to
combination of GIB plus sepsis in the setting of fever and
leukcytosis. Given cardiac history and PAT, cardiogenic shock
was also an option. However a TTE showed hyperdynamic EF with
fxnal obstruction, and CE were negative. The Pt remained
dependent on pressors to maintain BP through the hospital
course. Mr [**Known lastname 79418**] remained febrile throughout the course of
hospitalization and was covered for suspected PNA with cipro,
vanc, flagyl.
A [**8-22**] sputum culture prelim was postitive for gram neg rods and
yeast.  The Pt under went CT torso with contrast, which showed
no evidence of ulcer perforation, small B/L pleural effusions
and compressive atelectasis, heterogenous airspace opacity in
RUL, could be aspiration.  Although a PNA was suspected because
of imaging, fevers, and WBC up to 21, no definite source of
infection was identified by culture prior to his death

#Hematemesis/GIB: Per OSH notes, pt presented with bright red
emesis, Hct of 20, s/p 3U PRBC transfusion, with Hct on transfer
of 33. KUB reportedly unremarkable w/no evidence of free air @
OSH. Hct on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] 33. On exam, NG lavage: dark
maroon colored gastric secretions. Stool guaiac + with dark
tarry stools at OSH. No bright red blood per rectum. INR
slightly elevated but platelet count high/normal. Recieved a
total of 5 U pRBC. An Upper endoscopy by GI showed large ulcer,
clot removed, not actively bleeding. Serial Hcts remained stable
in 28s. Due to the patients shock surgery felt that he was not a
good surgical candidate likely requiring a prolonged cause of
mechanical ventilation and a fairly high surgical mortality
risk. The family felt that Mr [**Known lastname 79418**] would not want to go
through with a surgical procedure. The team talked at length
with family about possibilty of bx ulcer to determine if CA.
Since it was very possible that the bx would be inconclusive or
falsely negative, the family declined to pursue. Family believes
the prolonged trach and PEG necessary with stomach surgury would
be against the pts wishes.
.
#Respiratory Failure: Pt intubated @ OSH presumably for airway
protection given hypotension and poor mental status. CXR shows
interval dev't of R lung opacities which may represent PNA.  The
pt remained vent dependent throughout the hosptial stay despite
attempts at weaning.

#Code Status: After lengthy discussion with hte pt's Son,
[**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 79419**] (Health Care Proxy) as well as the rest of
the family the decision was made to transition Mr [**Known lastname 79418**] to
CMO on [**2137-8-24**]. They strongly felts that the prolonged recovery,
poor quality of life, and likely Trach and PEG associated with
any surgery to repair the ulcer would be against his wishes.
Therefore on [**8-25**] the pt was extubated, Levophed was withdrawen
and all abx were stoped.  Pt discomfort was aggressively
treatment with fentanyl and versed gtts.

Mr [**Known lastname 79418**] remained tachycardic and hypotensive after withdraw
of aggressive measures. At approxamitely 3am the pt became
progressively bradycardic and the RR lessened.  At 410am the pt
entered cardiac arrest.  On exam at 420am the pt was without a
pulse or respirations, pupils were fixed and dilated, and there
was no corneal reflex.  The pt was pernounced dead at 420am.

Cause of death was determined to be circulatory failure leading
to cardiac arrest with the antecedent cause of acute GIB.
