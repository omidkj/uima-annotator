HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, gastroesophageal reflux disease who
was brought to the Emergency Department by the EMT after he
complained of intermittent chest pain for three days, nausea
and lethargy.  The patient has had some episodes of
constipation as well as dark stools, increasing lower
extremity edema for the past two to three weeks.  He denies
any vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea.  The chest pain
resolved after arrival to the Emergency Department.  The EMTs
found him to have a heart rate in the 200s, irregular and he
was given Diltiazem which decreases heart rate to the 70s.
Electrocardiogram was consistent with rapid atrial
fibrillation.  In the Emergency Department, his heart rate
was in the 70s and electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation with inferolateral ST segment depressions.
Hematocrit was noted to be 18.  His baseline is 30.  His
stool was black and guaiac positive.  Systolic blood pressure
was 88 to 100.  Nasogastric lavage was performed and noted to
be negative.  The wife reports multiple urinary tract
infections since [**2172-7-22**] with courses of Augmentin,
Keflex and now ciprofloxacin.  The patient had noted diarrhea
in [**Month (only) 404**] and constipation for the last three to four weeks.
He denies any dysuria, shortness of breath, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, headache, fevers, chills or coughs.  He
has noted increasing lower extremity edema and weight gain
since early [**2171-2-20**].  He manages with an increased Lasix
dose.  He also noted an increased blood sugar over the
weekend and his wife gave him glyburide.

LABS:  White cell count 15/6, hematocrit 18.2, platelets 334.
His hematocrit on discharge was 31.7.  PT 21.8, INR 3.3, PTT
36.2, creatinine 1.3, BUN 97.  Troponin on admission was 7.4.

IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with
heart rate in the 70s.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with
mild congestive heart failure, linear opacities in the mid
right lung, no change from [**2172-8-21**].

ASSESSMENT:  This is an 83-year-old man who presents with a
history of coronary artery disease, rapid atrial fibrillation
who presents with severe anemia and guaiac positive stool
consistent with a gastrointestinal bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit with a hematocrit of 18 thought
to be secondary to an active gastrointestinal bleed.
Nasogastric lavage was negative in the Emergency Department,
but he was noted to have dark black melanotic guaiac positive
stools.  The gastroenterology team was consulted and they
initially recommended transfusing to keep his hematocrit over
30 with plans for endoscopy when he troponin decreased.  He
was transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells initially
with an adequate increase in his hematocrit.  He underwent an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on hospital day #3 which showed
gastritis.  Because his hematocrit continued to trend
downward, the patient underwent a colonoscopy to rule out a
lower gastrointestinal bleed.  Colonoscopy showed a few
diverticula as well as a single 13 mm nonbleeding polyp of
benign appearance which was removed for biopsy.  He was also
noted to have some diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.  His
hematocrit has been subsequently stable with no evidence of
active gastrointestinal bleeding.

2.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was admitted with a hematocrit
of 18 thought to be secondary to a gastrointestinal bleed in
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR.  He was given a dose
of vitamin K subcutaneously to reverse his INR and his
Coumadin withheld throughout his hospitalization.  He was
transfused periodically to keep his hematocrit above 30 given
his history of coronary artery disease.  His hematocrit was
stable upon discharge and his Coumadin was restarted upon
discharge.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  He was found to be in atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that slowed with
Diltiazem.  Troponins were elevated with flat CKs.  This was
felt to be secondary to demand ischemia in a setting of an
acute blood loss.  His troponin was trending downward and
given a history of coronary artery disease, a Persantine
thallium was performed for further risk stratification.  The
study showed global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of
39% and a severe fixed defect in the distal anterior apical
myocardial wall.  He was also started on Lasix and aldactone
as he was felt to be in congestive heart failure.

4.  RENAL:  His increased creatinine on admission was felt to
be secondary to intervascular depletion given his blood loss
and his creatinine decreased with blood transfusions and
intravenous fluids.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had a history of
recurrent urinary tract infection.  A routine urinalysis was
sent and noted to be negative.  The patient was afebrile and
his white cell count was stable throughout his
hospitalization.

DISPOSITION:  The patient has been severely deconditioned
over the past few months given his multiple hospitalizations
and his comorbidities.  He was screened by the physical
therapy team who recommended a short term stay in
rehabilitation prior to being discharged to home.
