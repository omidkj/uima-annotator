History of Present Illness:
54 year old Male with a PMH of HTN and etoh abuse who presented
to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-13**] in etoh withdrawal, reporting
tachycardia, cough, and chest pain. He drinks 1 quart of vodka
several days a week and last drink was around [**6-12**] or [**6-13**]. He
ruled out with 2 sets of negative cardiac enzymes and a
non-ischemic ekg, and was evaluated by cardiology. CXR neg for
acute process. His chest pain was felt likely due to bronchitis.
During the hospitalization he continued to exhibit withdrawal
symptoms so was started on CIWA. He required 20mg IV lorazepam
during the initial 6 hours of withdrawal and had respiratory
distress, cyanosis, and stridor. During intubation he was noted
to have a vocal cord polypoid mass and is thus being transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. Over the past 24 hours he has
required 12mg IV lorazepam. He is also on levofloxacin for
unclear reason. VS prior to transfer were 100.7, 87, 120/72, 31,
95%.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, patient is intubated, on
propofol, and mildly agitated. Vent settings are: AC, TV 500, RR
16, PEEP 5, FiO2 40%. He failed multiple weaning attempts and
ultimately underwent tracheostomy. After tracheostomy he was
discovered to have a pulmonary embolism on [**6-21**]. Subsequent
laryngoscopy showed severe laryngeal edema.

Past Medical History:
- OSA s/p removal of adenoids and uvula
- ? COPD
- Hepatitis C
- ETOH abuse
- Nicotine abuse
- Anxiety

Social History:
Was sober for 7 years but relapsed 5 years ago and has been
drinking a quart of vodka several times per week. Desires to
quit and has been through 20 rehabs. Smoked for over 30 years
but recently cut down to 1 pack per week. Lives with girlfriend.

Family History:
No history of head and neck cancer

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**2120-6-21**] CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute thromboembolus in the right upper lobar artery and
several main
segmental branches of the middle lobar artery.  There are
findings suggestive
of pulmonary hypertension, but no lung infarction or right heart
strain.
2.  Stable bilateral small pleural effusions and stable
atelectasis.  No
evidence of acute infectious process.
.
[**2120-6-20**] ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. No late contrast is seen in the left
heart (suggesting absence of intrapulmonary shunting). Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracardiac or cardiopulmonary
shunt. Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness
with preserved global and regional left ventricular systolic
function. Mildly dilated right ventricle. Mildly dilated aortic
root and ascending aorta. Normal pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
54M with a h/o etoh abuse who presented to an OSH on [**6-13**] for
chest pain, felt likely secondary to bronchitis. Hospital course
complicated by etoh withdrawal. Patient reportedly developed
stridor. ENT evaluated patient with CT scan and felt he may have
had a mass around the cords. He was sent to [**Hospital1 **] for further
evaluation.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Respiratory failure/Hypoxemia/Laryngeal Edema:
Patient was intubated at OSH for respiratory distress. On
tubated there was a polypoid lesion on his vocal cords and he
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation. Here, ENT performed direct
laryngoscopy which revealed edematous cords. He was given a
short course of steroids. Extubation was attempted however
resulted in recurrent respiratory distress requiring
reintubation. ENT felt that he has [**Last Name (un) 50614**] edema which will
resolve in a few weeks. He underwent tracheostomy placement.
***PATIENT WILL REQUIRE DOWN-SIZING OF TRACH DURING WEEK OF [**7-8**]
PER IP RECOMMENDATIONS.*** He was also need follow up with Dr.
