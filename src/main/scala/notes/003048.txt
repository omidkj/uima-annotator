Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
44 yo male with hx of asthma, EtOH and tobacco who presented
with SOB and fever to OSH found to have RML PNA requiring
intubation now complicated by pancreatitis, drug rash and acure
renal failure. Pt was admitted [**12-29**] for cough, anorexia, fever
and hemoptysis. CXR on admission showed RML PNA and was started
empirically on azithromycin and ceftriaxone. He was also noted
to be in ARF and was hydrated with improvement to creatinine
1.1. He became more hypoxic and tachycardic on [**12-30**] and was
intubated. He was started on solumedrol due to severe wheeze.
Over the past 5-6 days his creatinine has continued to climb and
then stabilized at 4.2. During this period his hematocrit has
also dropped to 25.2 from 39.7. He was started on tube feeds but
these were discontinued after an episode of high residuals and
emesis on [**1-3**]. Amylase and lipase were found to be elevated at
212 and 310 with RUQ U/S revealing gallbladder wall thickening
with sludge and and hypoechoic areas of the pancreas concerning
for pancreatitis. On [**1-8**] sputum cx revealed MSSA with influenza
negative so antibiotics were changed to nafcillin which resulted
in diffuse rash so this was changed again to vancomycin. Due to
continued clinical decline pt was transferred for further
management. Of note pt did receive Zosyn per ID consulation at
OSH but not noted on DC summary.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Admission CXR
Severe cavitary pneumonia of the right middle and upper lobes.
.
Renal Ultrasound
The right kidney measures 12.6 cm. The left kidney measures 12.2
cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or
renal mass. Cortical medullary differentiation is well
preserved. The bladder is decompressed secondary to a Foley
catheter.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2127-1-21**]:
FINDINGS:  The conglomerate of large cavities in the right upper
lobe is
smaller, 12.7 x 6.6 cm today, previously 13.7 x 8.2 cm, and
contains less
debris/soft tissue.  Adjacent loculated pneumothorax has
decreased in size. Peripheral consolidation located anterior to
the right major fissure measures 20 x 13 mm, was 35 x 31 mm.
Cavitary lesion in the left apex measuring 18 x 13 mm was 23 x
16 mm, now fluid filled.  Peribronchial inflammation throughout
remaining of both lobes is new, for instance in the left lower
lobe (3, 50).  Impaction and/or narrowing of the right upper
lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, and right lower
lobe bronchus has resolved.  There are no endobronchial lesions.
 Small right pleural effusion has decreased in size. There is no
left pleural effusion.  Trace of pericardial effusion is stable.
Paratracheal, subcarinal, and carinal lymph nodes have decreased
in size, for
instance a 14- mm carinal lymph node was 16 mm.  Cardiac size is
normal.
Moderate atherosclerotic calcification is present in the LAD
