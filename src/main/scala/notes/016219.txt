HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63 year old female
with one vessel coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular
disease, and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of left carotid and left subclavian, who was
admitted for stenting of the right brachiocephalic for relief
of right upper extremity claudication symptoms.  Over the
past year, the patient had noticed weakness and pain in the
right upper extremity while doing her activities of daily
living.  She has noted no sensation changes.  Otherwise, her
baseline shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion are at
baseline.  She does have orthopnea, although without any

coronary artery without intervention.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease, aorto vascular bypass.
3.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of left carotid and left subclavian arteries.
4.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
5.  Renal artery stenosis, status post left renal artery
stent.
6.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
8.  Peptic ulcer disease with gastrointestinal bleed.
9.  Hypercholesterolemia.
10. Hypertension.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 97.8, blood pressure
104/60, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 94% in room
air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination - Moist
mucous membranes.  The neck reveals no jugular venous
distention and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular - regular
rate and rhythm, with II/VI systolic ejection murmur of the
left upper sternal border.  Pulmonary - bibasilar crackles.
The abdomen is obese, soft, positive bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities - no edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Neurologically, no focal deficit.  Strength is [**5-26**]
throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, hematocrit 30.0, white blood
cell count 5.0.  Coagulation studies within normal limits.
Electrolytes notable for blood urea nitrogen of 46,
creatinine 2.8, bicarbonate 30.

HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the Medicine
unit for stenting of the right brachiocephalic in the
morning.  She was given intravenous fluid hydration and
Mucomyst overnight for the chronic renal failure.  During the
procedure, the patient was noted to have in-stent restenosis
in the left subclavian and left common carotid arteries.  In
addition, there was an old nonhealed spiral dissection of the
left subclavian.  The patient received percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting of the
in-stent restenosis in the left subclavian as well as
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty thrombectomy and stent
placement in the dissection of the left subclavian.  The
patient's course was complicated by a large right sided groin
bleed and hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the
70s.  She was transferred to CCU where her blood pressure was
maintained and vascular surgery was consulted.  In addition,
she was given four units of packed red blood cells.  The
patient stabilized and was transferred to the floor with
plans to repeat an ultrasound over the groin and possible
repair.  Three days later, the patient was noted to have an
enlarging ecchymosis in the right groin and a tense hematoma,
5.0 by 2.0 centimeters. The following a.m. the patient
underwent pseudoaneurysm repair.  The procedure was without
complications.  The patient did well.

However, two days after repair, the patient developed acute
onset clear nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting.  In addition, she
felt a bloating feeling in her upper abdomen.  An ultrasound
was obtained which showed a probable acute cholecystitis.
White count remained normal.  The patient remained afebrile.
Surgery was consulted.  She was started on intravenous
antibiotics.  Overnight, she improved markedly.  Abdominal
pain resolved within 24 hours.  Gastroenterology was
consulted for an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.  She underwent the procedure which
showed a duodenitis, a filling defect in the distal biliary
tree, normal pancreatic duct.  She underwent a successful
sphincterotomy and successful sludge extraction.  She was
continued on her Levaquin antibiotic.  The patient's diet was
advanced.  She tolerated it well.

The patient is discharged to home.  She is to follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this week for likely cholecystectomy early next week.
She is also to follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in two to four weeks
for scheduled left common carotid artery stent.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  In-stent restenosis of the left subclavian and left
common carotid arteries, status post stent left subclavian.
2.  Pseudoaneurysm right groin, status post surgical repair.
3.  Acute cholecystitis.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Atorvastatin 30 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Paxil 10 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Levofloxacin one p.o. once daily times three days to
