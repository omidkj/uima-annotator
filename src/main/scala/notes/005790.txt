Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
74yo man with h/o CAD, DM2, A fib, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
and recent episode of bronchitis presented with two days of
worsening dyspnea. He initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with
complaints of shortness of breath for two days. He reports that
he does not
have dyspnea at his baseline; normally, he can climb a flight
of stairs and walks his dog daily without any chest pain or
shortness of breath.
.
About 2.5 weeks ago, he was playing hand ball, and noticed that
he got very winded and fatigued after only five minutes of
activity; he rested, felt better, and then again he got
instantly winded. He subsequently went on a trip to [**State 4565**],
and reports that during the travel and for several days after he
was more fatigued than normal. Two days prior to admission, he
was raking leaves in his yard with his hands, and afterward he
experienced continued shortness of breath at both rest and
worsened with exertion, which persisted for two days.
.
He initially presented to [**Location (un) 620**] for this continued fatigue /
dyspnea. At [**Location (un) 620**], evaluation notable for elevated d-dimer,
elevated troponin at 0.153 (0.00 - 0.01), and elevated BNP at
4133. BUN/Creat of 32/1.5. He was given ASA 325mg and lopressor
25mg.
.
In ED at [**Hospital1 18**], he was given metoprolol 5mg, 150mEq of
bicarbonate, and mucomyst prior to CTA of chest to r/o PE. He
was continued on home medications. He spiked to 100.3, and was
started on levofloxacin for presumed CAP. On [**2143-3-12**] he was taken
to the cardiac catheterization lab, where he was found to have
the following stenoses: LMCA- 20%; LAD- ostial 90%, mid 70%,
dist apical 80%, large diag subtotal occluded; LCX- ramus 80%,
70% tubular stenosis, OM1 70%, OM2 severe. Right heart
catheterization revealed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures (RVEDP = 14 mmhg, mean PCWP 25 mmhg with prominent v
waves). There was no evidence for pulmonary hypertension.
Cardiac output and index were depressed at 3.4 and 1.7 L/min/m2
respectively.
.
ROS: No recent fevers, chills, weight loss, sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **]
denies chest pain, orthopnea, PND, peripheral edema,
claudication. He has had a non-productive cough. He had not had
any abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. He
denies dysuria, frequency, discharge. He has not noticed any
nosebleeds, BRBPR, easy bruising, hematuria. He denies calf
pain.
Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgical evaluation.

. ekg changes c/w ischemia
. inferior basal ischemia on echo - this was a small area
and unchanged compared to prior in '[**37**].
- cath records not available; by report, "only mild disease";
has never had stents or CABG done.
2. Atrial fibrillation; failed cardioversion in past
3. HTN
4. Insulin requiring DM2
5. depression
6. hyperlipidemia
7. inguinal hernias
8. kidney stones
9. s/p bronchitis about three weeks ago
10. reports h/o allergic symptoms, dyspnea, cough
with previous exposure to leaves.
11. feet neuropathy


Social History:
Retired [**Company 378**] employee (19 years ago). Married, lives with wife,
has 8 children. Denies ever using tobacco; occasionally uses
alcohol ([**12-10**] glass wine daily).

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**Location (un) 620**]: atrial fibrillation, 76bpm, likely old anterior
wall
MI with Q waves in anterior precordial leads. Non-specific ST/T

wave changes in lateral precordial leads V4-6 (no old EKG for
comparison)

ECG [**Hospital1 18**]: atrial fibrillation, 83 bpm, q waves V1, V3, V4. Nl
intervals. Nl axis. Flat T waves I, II, III, aVL. Compared to
tracing from [**Location (un) 620**]
.
CXR:
1. Mild congestive heart failure.
2. Ill-defined retrocardiac density. Follow up PA and lateral
chest
radiograph after resolution of pulmonary edema is recommended to
further assess for resolution and to exclude a neoplastic nodule
in this area.
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
effusions.
3) Right hilar lymphadenopathy, which may be reactive. Follow-up
is
recommended after treatment of congestive heart failure.
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include mid to distal anterior
septal/anterior akinesis and apical akinesis dyskinesis. No
definite LV thrombus identified but cannot definitively exclude.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
CATH:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed severe native three vessel coronary artery disease. The
left main coronary artery has a 20% ostial stenosis. The left
anterior descending is diffusely diseased. There is a 90% ostial
LAD stenosis. There is a 70% mid-LAD stenosis. There is an 80%
distal - apical LAD stenosis. A large diagonal branch is
sub-totally occluded. There is a significant ramus branch with a
80% ostial stenosis. The left circumflex artery is the dominant
vessel. There is a 70% tubular stenosis of the LCX. The OM1 has
a 70% stenosis. The OM2 and LPDA are severely diseased. The
right coronary artery is non-dominant and is diffusely diseased.

2. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures (RVEDP = 14 mmhg, mean PCWP 25 mmhg with
prominent v waves). There was no evidence for pulmonary
hypertension.
3. Cardiac output and index were depressed at 3.4 and 1.7
L/min/m2
respectively.
4. Left heart cathererization did not reveal evidence of
systemic
hypotension.
.
CAROTID US:
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate plaque with a left 40-59% carotid stenosis.
On the right, there is less than 40% stenosis.
.
CT CHEST:
FINAL REPORT


INDICATION: Right sided chest pain and congestive heart failure.


COMPARISON: No previous chest CT. Chest radiographs of the same
day are
available for correlation.

TECHNIQUE: Gated axial multidetector CT images of the chest were
obtained
with 100 cc of intravenous Optiray. Multiplanar reformatted 2D
and 3D images
were obtained.

CHEST CT ANGIOGRAM: There are no filling defects in the
pulmonary vasculature
to suggest pulmonary embolism. The heart and aorta appear
unremarkable. There
is no pericardial effusion. Small bilateral pleural effusions
are present.
There are bilateral ground glass opacities, predominantly in the
lower lobes,
compatible with pulmonary edema. The tracheobronchial tree is
patent to the
subsegmental levels. There is a 14 mm segmental lymph node in
the right lower
lobe and an 11 mm right interlobar lymph node. Subcentimeter
paratracheal and
left periaortic lymph nodes are also present.
