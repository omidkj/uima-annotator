Mr. [**Known lastname 36365**] is a 53 year-old man with history of renal

presented with abdominal discomfort for a few days.  He was
discharged on [**10-28**] from [**Hospital1 18**].  During that admission he had an
EGD and cauterization for hematemesis [**2-2**] bleeding from his CA
site.  After discharge he continued his XRT daily.  He had
abdominal pain even during his last admission which has been
getting somewhat worse after his discharge.  He also notes that

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2104-10-30**])
1) Decompressed colon, with no significant change in the
appearance of the bowel from prior.  Colonic diverticulosis
without evidence of diverticulitis.
2) Diffuse metastatic disease involving the lungs, liver, lymph
nodes, and
osseous structures.
3) Small left pleural effusion.
.
CT Abdomen ([**2104-10-27**])
1. Apparent mild wall thickening of the descending and sigmoid
colon may be due to underdistension. However, given underlying
diverticulosis, and mild stranding around the ascending and left
colon, a focal/segmental colitis secondary to diverticulitis, or
other infectious or ischemic etiologies could be considered in
the appropriate clinical setting.
2. Increased size of multiple liver metastases, some of which
bulge the liver capsule.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary this is a 53 year-old man with history of metastatic
esophageal CA, DVT, renal transplant, and hypertension
presenting with abdominal pain, low grade fevers and concern for
diverticulitis vs colitis.
.
# Abdominal Pain
There was concern for diverticulitis/colitis, especially in the
setting of past h/o diverticulitis and current
immunosuppression.  He was continued on IV antibiotics with
Cipro and Flagyl.  He was made NPO initially but quickly
progressed to clears than solids on HD 2.  Blood cultures
returned negative x2 and abdominal pain improved significantly
by HD 2.  He will be sent home to complete a ten-day course of
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.
.
# Esophageal CA stage IV (metastatic to bones, liver, lung)
He is currently undergoing XRT and will resume this next week.
.
# History of DVT/PE
He had been on Lovenox but this was stopped during previous
admission due to hematemesis.  He has an IVC filter in place.
.
# ESRD [**2-2**] to IgA Nephropathy s/p Kidney Transplant [**2091**] and
[**2101**]
He was continued on tacrolimus and dexamethasone.  The
transplant team came by and recommended no changes to his
current regimen.  He was continued on Bactrim for prophylaxis.
.
# H/o GI bleed
He is s/p recent upper endoscopy and cauterization to bleeding
esophageal mass.  The XRT is being administered in part to
prevent future bleeding.  While in house, he was continued on
protonix twice daily.  His outpatient regimen consists of
protonix in the morning and ranitidine at night.
.
# Hyperlipidemia
We continued his outpatient Lipitor.
.
Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin, then discontinued once
ambulating.  He was kept on Bactrim, PPI, and bowel regimen
throughout.  He was NPO initially but quickly progressed diet as
tolerated.
