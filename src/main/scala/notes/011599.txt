CTA [**2108-11-8**]: no PE

CT abd [**2108-11-12**]:
1. Perihepatic and right paracolic ascites extending into the
pelvis. There is a high-density collection adjacent to the
anastomotic sutures of the transverse colon likely representing
postoperative hematoma. High-density material within the pelvis
also likely represents postoperative clot. There is no
pneumoperitoneum or leakage of oral contrast.
2. Dilated loops of small bowel, likely represent postoperative
ileus.
3. Right lower lobe consolidation consistent with provided
history of
pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Nasogastric tube is looped in the second portion of the
duodenum.

CT Torso [**2108-11-18**]:
1. Free intraperitoneal air communicating with intracolonic air
adjacent to the anastomotic site, concerning for anastomotic
leak.
2. Free intraperitoneal air tracking through the rectus muscle
just to the
right of midline with increased anterior midline subcutaneous
air, concerning for wound dehiscence.
3. Probable small bowel ileus.
4. Improved but persistent right lower lobe opacity with
resolved right
pleural effusion, consistent with improving right lower lobe
pneumonia.

Duplex renal US [**2108-11-23**]:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis, no evidence for renal artery
stanosis
2. Elevated resistive indices in the interlobular and main renal
arteries
bilaterally is consistent with a parenchymal process such as
glomerulonephritis, interstitiell nephritis or diabetic
nephropathy

CT Torso [**2108-11-26**]:
1. Interval collapse of a previously drained anterior abscess
cavity with
pigtail catheter in place, adjacent to the ileocolic
anastomosis.
2. Organized appearance of a previously present hematoma or
hemorrhagic fluid collection extending from the right upper
quadrant to the deep pelvis. While this may simply represent
organized hematoma or ascitic fluid, an abscess cannot be
excluded. Please note that the loops of bowel in the right
abdomen are poorly delineated as the contrast within the bowel
has not passed distally at the time of scanning, and rescanning
after a suitable delay could be performed for better assessment
of the margins of the collection.
3. Diffuse distention of small bowel, likely related to ileus.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for elective right colectomy for colonic
polyp that could not be removed  on colonoscopy. He tolerated
the procedure well and was extubated and transferred to the PACU
in good condition. On POD 0 he was transferred to the floor, was
kept NPO with IVF running. He had an epidural placed for the
operation and needed it replaced in the PACU.

Neuro: Epidural was placed initially for pain management and was
removed on POD 3 and patient was transitioned to IV then PO pain
medications. He was started on a CIWA scale but was not noted to
score until overnight POD3 into POD4. He had multiple episodes
of emesis and then developed visual hallucinations
