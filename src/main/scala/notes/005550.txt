Labs prior to discharge:

Micro:
[**8-21**] blood culture pending
[**8-20**] urine culture pending
[**8-20**] blood culture pending

Imaging:
[**8-18**] left knee xray: Skin staples are present. Subcutaneous
edema and emphysema, post-surgical. Gas is seen within the
joint, post-surgical. A surgical drain is seen within the joint.
Status post left total knee arthroplasty. Normal alignment.
Prior ACL reconstruction. The hardware is intact and unchanged
in position. Posttraumatic deformity of the proximal fibula.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes of the left knee as above.

[**8-19**] CXR: Vascular engorgement predominantly in the left lung
and interval increase in mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly all
suggest cardiac decompensation, perhaps due to volume overload.
No pneumothorax.

[**8-20**] CXR: Increased caliber to the upper mediastinum suggests
volume overload but there is no pulmonary edema. Left infrahilar
opacification is probably atelectasis, unchanged. Heart size top
normal. Small right pleural effusion may be present. No
pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
53M with Hx of HCC Cirrhosis, OSA admitted for left TKR
complicated by respiratory distress and fever.

# Left BKA: The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery
service and was taken to the operating room for L knee surgery
as described above. Please see separately dictated operative
report for details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the
patient tolerated the procedure well. Patient received
perioperative IV antibiotics.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for post-operative
somnolence and hypoxemia. Initial VBG at time of ICU transfer
was 7.31/66/55. Treated with autoset CPAP and nasal trumpet for
respiratory acidosis. He was awake and alert at time of transfer
back to the floor on POD#1. While in the ICU, he did experience
knee pain, especially during mobilization; his IV morphine pain
regimen was transitioned to PO narcotics. Pain was initially
controlled with IV morphine. At time of transfer to the floor,
the patient was controlled on oxycodone 5-10 mg PO q4H PRN.

Upon the patient's first transfer from the ICU, the patient was
written for PO oxycodone as well as IV morphine for pain
control. On the othro floor, the patient received 12mg po
Dilaudid. In the evening he was found to be somnolent and
unresponsive with a blood gas shoing hypoxemia and hyprecarbia,
so he given narcan and transferred back to the ICU. He responded
well to narcan: no longer somnolent, O2 saturation improved.
Pain medications were reduced: IV morphine stopped and oxycodone
decreased to 5-10 mg q6H PRN. Of note, the patient does have a
chronic need for CPAP/BiPAP. Of note, patient is concerned that
he became somnolent because he responds poorly to supplemental
O2 given his suspected COPD. He does not have an outpatient
pulmonologist and will need to be setup with outpatient
pulmology followup at time of discharge.

The patient received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the
morning of POD#1; this was later increased to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] (weight
based dosing).  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient
was voiding independently thereafter.

The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical
incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or
abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical
therapy.

Per the [**Hospital1 **] service, the operative extremity was
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. The patient's
weight-bearing status is weight bearing as tolerated on the
operative extremity.

Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted
accordingly. The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
The patient's hematocrit was stable and pain was adequately
controlled on an oral regimen.

The patient was transferred in and out the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on POD#3
requiring a narcan gtt in the setting of somulence. He was
subsequently called out to the Hospital Medicine Service.

On POD#4 the pt was noted to have erythema of the left knee in
the setting of fever, discharge was subsequently delayed and the
pt was given a dose of Vancomycin.

On POD#5 the patient had significant improvement in his erythema
and no more episodes of fever.  He did not complain of any other
localizing symptoms and had a normal WBC count.  He was also
evaluated by Orthopedics as well, who felt that his erythema was
not consistent with cellulitis, and more likely due to a small
hematoma.  Nonetheless, they recommended a prophylactic course
of antibiotics.  Given that pt has had a history of positive
MRSA screen in the recent past, he will be discharged on a
regimen of Bactrim for prophylaxis.

Of note, pt still has several sets of blood cultures that are
still pending at time of discharge.
