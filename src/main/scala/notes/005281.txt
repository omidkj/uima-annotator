Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
Diffuse severe tracheal bronchomalacia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2128-1-23**]  Flexible [**Year/Month/Day **], tracheoplasty with mesh, right
and left mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius
bronchoplasty with mesh


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69234**] is a 53-year-old woman who had previously undergone a
cervical tracheal resection and reconstruction, as well as a
posterior thoracic
membranous wall tracheoplasty on [**2126-7-31**]. Ms. [**Known lastname 69234**]
had previously had multiple surgeries requiring intubation in
the past and was found have progressive dyspnea beginning in
[**2124**]. She was diagnosed with sarcoid via a right thoracoscopic
biopsy. She was also found to have tracheal stenosis in the
cervical trachea, as well as more distal tracheomalacia. The
tracheal stenosis was resected as mentioned above and a wedge
tracheoplasty of the membranous
wall down past the thoracic inlet had been performed.

Unfortunately Ms. [**Known lastname 69237**] dyspnea and cough returned and it was
progressive over the course of the last year. Repeat
[**Known lastname **] noted that there was no significant residual
tracheal stenosis, but there was diffuse tracheal
bronchomalacia, most notably in the proximal and distal trachea,
as well as right mainstem bronchus. She underwent
tracheobronchial Y stenting on [**2127-11-20**]. Following this,
she had marked improvement in her dyspnea.
Unfortunately, she still did have a cough which was thought to
be secondary to the foreign body. Due to the significant
improvement in her dyspnea, it was recommended to move forward
with the surgical correction of her airway. This
would involve a right thoracotomy and posterior tracheal
splinting with a Marlex mesh. We would also perform bilateral
bronchoplasty.


Past Medical History:
Tracheal stenosis, Trachealbronchomalacia, diagnosis of
sarcoidosis and multiple endotracheal intubations (7 total)for
various surgical procedures
PMHX: sarcoidosis, OSA-CPAP at home, Asthma, hypothyroid, DJD

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 69234**] is a 53 year-old female with h/o tracheal stenosis,
tracheobronchomalacia, sarcoidosis s/p VATS biopsy of the R
lung, who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for scheduled tracheoplasty.  On
[**2128-1-22**], she underwent R thoracotomy and tracheoplasty.  She
tolerated all procedures well - for details of the operation,
please see operative note.  Her [**Hospital **] hospital course has been
relatively uncomplicated. She was admitted to the SICU post-op
for routine monitoring, Acute Pain Service placed an epidural
preoperatively, which provided good pain control until POD#2,
when the epidural was split, and a Dilaudid PCA was added for
better pain control. This was transitioned to PO pain medication
on POD#4 with good effect.  The chest-tube was removed and no
pneumothorax was seen on chest x-ray.  The foley was removed and
she voided without difficulty.  On POD #5 she was started on a
clear liquid diet which she tolerated and was advanced to a
soft-dysphagia prior discharge.  Aggressive pulmonary toileting
was continued, along with CPAP at bedtime.  On POD #7 she
underwent [**Hospital **] which revealed: The distal trachea had
very minimal residual malacia. The left mainstem had no
significant malacia. The right mainstem had very minimal
residual malacia. There were some thin, whitish secretions.
There was no purulence. All airways were otherwise patent. She
continued on her home medications and was discharged to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 86**]
location prior to returning to [**State 2690**].  She will follow-up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
