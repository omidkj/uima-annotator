Admission Date:  [**2120-5-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2120-5-24**]

Date of Birth:   [**2044-9-30**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male with
a history of diabetes, who originally presented to the C-Med
service on [**2120-5-18**] with epigastric pain/pressure/diaphoresis,
in addition to nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath.  He
was found to be initially hypotensive to 85/33 with a pulse
of 60.  The patient was treated at an outside hospital with
one-half dose of TPA, in addition to receiving heparin,
nitroglycerin, and dopamine.  The patient's EKG, at the time,
was 100% V paced.  His CK peaked at 233 with an MB of 19, an
MB index of 35.6, and a troponin of 44.8.  The patient went
to catheterization on [**2120-5-20**].  At catheterization, he had
right atrial pressures of 14, RV pressure of 35/10, PA
pressures of 35/17, and a wedge of 22.  Patient was noted to
have a mid left circumflex 90% occlusion, status post
insertion of drug eluding stent with resultant TIMI-3 flow.
Patient was also noted to have moderate diffuse disease in
the LAD, and a small mild diffuse disease in the RCA.
Echocardiogram on [**2120-5-21**] showed an EF of 60%, asymmetric
LVH, and hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, in
addition to mild pulmonary artery hypertension.

On [**2120-5-21**], the patient was asked to be evaluated by the CCU
team.  He had spiked a fever up to 102.8.  At that time, he
flipped into atrial fibrillation with rates up to 130.  The
patient was noted to have an episode of respiratory distress
and chest tightness times 90 minutes.  Patient was never
hypoxic.  Patient received IV Lopressor times two.  The
patient continued in atrial fibrillation at a lower rate of
90-100, but was noted to have mean arterial pressures of
50-60.

Currently, the patient is symptom free.  He denies any
headache, neck stiffness, cough, chest pain, shortness of
breath, pleuritic pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, GU
symptoms, rash, joint pain.

Chest x-ray from [**2120-5-21**] was clear, UA was negative, and
blood cultures were drawn.  The patient was started
empirically on vancomycin and levofloxacin for fear of
sepsis.  He also received a total of 2.5 liters of normal
saline.  The patient's blood pressure did not initially
respond to the fluids on the floor and, for this reason, he
was transferred up to the CCU.

general, the patient is in no apparent distress, no
respiratory distress or use of accessory muscles.  HEENT:

auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles or rhonchi.

Extremities: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neuro: Alert
and oriented times three.

LABORATORY/DIAGNOSTICS:  White count 6.2, hematocrit 33.8,
platelets 149.  Sodium 132, potassium 4.0, chloride 98,
bicarbonate 22, BUN 12, creatinine 0.7, glucose 154, calcium
8.7, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus 2.8.  Urinalysis: Moderate
blood, 0-2 red blood cells, 0-2 white blood cells, 0-2
squamous epithelial cells.  Blood cultures from [**2120-5-21**]: No
growth.  Urine culture from [**2120-5-21**]: No growth.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In short, this is a 75-year-old male with
diabetes, sick sinus syndrome, status post inferior MI with
drug eluded stenting of the left circumflex artery, who now
presents with fever up to 102.8 with hypotension, change from
AV pacing to atrial fibrillation which is new.

1.  CAD:  As already noted, patient is status post IMI.  EKG
showed Q waves in the inferior leads.  The patient was
continued on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  With this acute
fever and hypotensive episode, in addition to the new atrial
fibrillation, the patient's CK rose up to 790, but with a
negative MB.  The patient was able to be started on beta
blocker which was titrated up.

2.  Hypotension:  It is still somewhat unclear why the
patient became hypotensive.  The most probable explanation is
that he became transiently bacteremic with a drop in his SVR.
There was no bleeding at the right femoral catheterization
site.  The patient did not initially respond to fluids on the
floor but, after getting about three liters, he was able to
keep his mean arterial pressure greater than 60.  The patient
never required pressors for blood pressure support.

3.  Rhythm:  The patient was noted to be in new onset atrial
fibrillation.  This was likely secondary to his transient
bacteremia.  The patient initially had a rapid ventricular
response, but responded well to Lopressor, in addition to
fluids.  The patient spontaneously converted out of atrial
fibrillation and was, once again, AV paced.  He was initially
started on heparin for the atrial fibrillation.  While we
cannot totally rule out that the patient does not have PAF,
we did not feel like he needed long-term anticoagulation at
this point.  This should be readdressed as an outpatient.

4.  ID:  Patient spiked a fever up to 102.8.  There was no
localizing source of infection, no elevated white blood cell
count.  Given the hypotension, he was empirically started on
levofloxacin and vancomycin.  Given the negative culture data
times 72 hours, the vancomycin was stopped.  The patient was
continued on a seven day course of levofloxacin.  Other
sources of fever were considered but, given the rigors and
the high temperature, bacteremia is most likely.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Tylenol, 325 mg PO q 4-6 hours p.r.n..
2.  Aspirin, 325 mg PO q d.
3.  Xalatan.
4.  Lipitor, 10 mg PO q d.
5.  Dilantin, 200 mg PO b.i.d..
6.  Plavix, 75 mg PO q d times 12 months.
7.  Lopressor, 12.5 mg PO b.i.d..
8.  Levofloxacin, 500 mg PO q d through [**2120-5-27**].
9.  Metformin, 500 mg PO q a.m..
10. Glyburide, 5 mg PO q a.m..
11. Aldactone, 50 mg PO q d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should follow-up with
his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] addition to his cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**],
within one week.  The patient was instructed to see a doctor
if he experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers
or chills, nausea or vomiting, excessive sweating or
dizziness.  Patient's Lopressor dose should be titrated up as
tolerated.  In addition, he should be started on an ACE
inhibitor, given that he is post MI.

DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post inferior MI, status post cardiac
catheterization with stenting of left circumflex artery.
2.  Hypotension secondary to presumed transient bacteremia.
3.  Transient atrial fibrillation.
4.  Diabetes.
5.  Sick sinus syndrome, status post pacer.
