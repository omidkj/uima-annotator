Chief Complaint:
Bile leak s/p Laparoscopic cholecystectomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
incisional hernia repair

perc biloma drain,
lap CCY (OSH)


History of Present Illness:
68 year old woman with hx of CAD s/p CABG, COPD, CKD, DM2 who is
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] after developing septic shock with multi-organ
failure following elective cholecystectomy. She presented for
elective lap chole on [**2197-5-24**]. She tolerated the initial
procedure well and was admitted to the surgical floor on [**2197-5-24**]
~4pm. At approximately 4pm on [**2197-5-25**] she developed nausea and
was found to be hypotensive to sbp ~58 with recheck of sbp ~90s.
She was transfered to the ICU. She responded to fluid boluses.
She had a HIDA scan that showed biliary leak. She had a
subhepatic pigtail catheter placed. On [**2197-5-26**] ~7pm she was
found to be tachycardic with moderate respiratory distress. She
was intubated with 7.5 cm ETT. CXR confirmed adequate placement.
She then developed an SVT and treated with adenosine then
amiodarone. She was started on levophed and vasopression for
hypotension. Access with left femoral line and left femoral art
line placed. Amiodarone was discontinued and dobutamine added. A
PA catheter was placed. Troponin was elevated. Lactate was 8.1.
Her urine output continued to decreased and she was dialyzed for
severe acidosis. She received 2 units of pRBCs and 2 units of
FFP. Digoxin was added for additional rate control. Decision was
made to transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.

ERCP BILIARY ONLY PORTABLY BY TECH  [**2197-5-27**] 1:51 PM
FINDINGS: Seven fluoroscopic images were obtained without a
radiologist present and submitted for review. These demonstrate
clips in the right upper quadrant. Contrast injection
demonstrates filling of the cystic duct stump with free contrast
extravasation identified.

IMPRESSION: Biliary leak identified from the cystic duct
remnant.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-5-29**] 2:47 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of pneumoperitoneum and surgical defect in the
anterior abdominal wall. Dilated proximal small bowel. Contrast
has not yet progressed to the distal small bowel. The distal
small bowel loops appear somewhat decompressed. While no free
contrast is seen in the abdomen, a distal small bowel
perforation is not entirely excluded. The dilated proximal small
bowel may represent postoperative ileus. If clinically
indicated, followup delayed imaging may be obtained to assess
the progress of contrast through the remaining small bowel
loops.
2. Status post cholecystectomy and biliary tube in place,
percutaneous drain in the right lower quadrant. No focal
collection of free fluid in the abdomen is seen.
3. Non-specific lesion in the right hepatic lobe, which may
represent a cyst. Further assessment may be obtained as
clinically indicated with ultrasound.
4. Bilateral adrenal enlargements, likely representing adrenal
hyperplasia. Clinical correlation is needed.
5. Two left-sided low-density renal masses likely representing
cysts.
.
ECHO
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
40-45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
The aortic valve is not well seen. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion
.
MRI ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2197-5-31**] 1:44 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study due to lack of contrast, and non-breathhold
technique due to the fact that the patient was intubated.
2. No discrete fluid collections are seen in the right upper
quadrant. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary
dilatation.
3. Suggestion of anomalous insertion of the posterior right
hepatic duct into the proximal left hepatic duct. If clinically
indicated, a repeat study may be obtained when patient's
conditions improves (utilizing breathhold imaging) to provide
more detail for assessment of the intrahepatic biliary anatomy.
4. Anasarca and small amount of free intraperitoneal fluid.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2197-6-9**] 6:02 AM
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable and unremarkable. A right subclavian
catheter tip terminates in the low SVC. A nasogastric tube
terminates below the field of view with side port well below the
GE junction. A left internal jugular catheter tip terminates
over the lower left brachiocephalic vein. There is mild stable
vascular congestion with no overt failure. Lung volumes are low
and stable with stable mild linear atelectasis bilaterally.
There are bilateral pleural effusions with components of
fissural loculation which are overall unchanged.
.
PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2197-6-15**] 11:37 AM
IMPRESSION: Dilated loops of small bowel centrally, likely
representing an ileus.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2197-6-17**] 5:33 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-15**] and 9:
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion suggests continued left
ventricular decompensation, but there is minimal if any
pulmonary edema. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left, have increased. Heart size is top normal.
Opacification at the right lung base is probably atelectasis.
Tip of the left PIC catheter projects over the junction of the
brachiocephalic veins and a right subclavian dual-channel
central venous line ends in the upper SVC. No pneumothorax.
