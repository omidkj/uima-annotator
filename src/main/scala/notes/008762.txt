History of Present Illness:
This is a 49 year-old male with a history of HBV hepatitis on
entecavir , hypercholesterolemia, family history of premature
CAD who presents with leg swelling and progressive SOB.
.
Worked up in late [**2125-12-10**] for week or so of cough, told he
had pneumonia by CXR, received 5 days of azyhtromycin w/o any
improvement in his cough. Got second CXR around [**12-24**]
findings had not cleared got another course of 5 days
Azithromycin which he finished 7 days prior to presentation
again w/o improvement in cough. During this period except for
cough complained of exertional dyspnea which has progressed
rapidly over the past week from 20 stairs to dyspnea at rest.
Admits to orthopnea two or more pillows, describes paroxysmal
cough at night but not PND. Noticed 11 lb weight gain over past
two months.  No nocturia. Denies chest pain. Two days prior to
admission had CT chest which showed diffuse bilateral
ground-glass infiltrates consistent with infectious process,
most likely atypical or viral pneumonia as well as bilateral
pleural effusions.  On day prior to admission noticed swelling
on right foot followed later by left foot swelling. Saw his PCP
who sent him to the ER.
.
  Does not recall recent febrile illness. Believes all his
symptoms started after  "overworked" himself in the gym around
Thanks Giving and had to spend a day in bed because of general
muscle soarness and chest pain. Patient has no history of HF or
coronary disease. Denies any recent travels. No contacts with
animals. No bites or stings. No contact with [**Name2 (NI) **] people. Was
vaccinated for Flu in early novemebr.
.
In the ED, admission vitals were: 99.9 121 134/91 20 100% on 4L
O2. He triggered for tachypnea 30-40 and dested to high 80's in
RA. Found to have right leg swelling, LENI was negative for DVT
as was CTA for PE. CTA did show multifocal ground glass
opacities and bil mod pleural effusions R>L essentially
unchanged from CT of 2 days prior. Labs showed unremarkable CBC,
chemistry remarkable for HCO3 = 21 with normal anion gap.
d-dimer was 3019. trop X 1 was negative. Patient was given 1
dose of ceftriaxone + levoflox in the ED (1900). His transfer
vitals were HR 112 BP 123/88 RR 34 Sat 95%4l
.
ROS:
+ nausea over past few days
- denies any fevers, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, melena, urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria,
lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness, vision
changes, headache, rash.
.

Past Medical History:

fibrosis on Entecavir with good response and normalized LFT's.
- Hypercholesterolemia
- bil varicocele surgery [**2108**]

ECG [**3-11**]: Sinus tachycardia. Right superior axis. Low voltage.
Right bundle-branch block with prominent precordial Q waves in
leads V1-V4 with mild ST segment elevations. Consider pulmonary
disease, right ventricular hypertrophy, anterior wall myocardial
infarction. Low limb lead voltage.
.
Chest CTA [**3-11**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multilobar ground-glass opacities, similar in distribution to
the prior
examination with possible small increase in consolidation.
Findings
compatible with infectious process.
3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions again seen.
4. Reflux of contrast into the IVC suggestive of right heart
failure which
can be further evaluated on echocardiogram. Non-specific left
ventricular
apex wall thickening can also be further evaluated on
echocardiogram.
.
Cardiac echo [**3-12**]: Normal left ventricular cavity size with
extensive regioanl systolic dysfunction suggestive of
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Apical mural left
ventricular thrombus. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with
free wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. LVEF < 20%
.
Cardiac MRI [**3-13**]:
Impression:
1. Mildly enlarged left ventricular cavity size with severely
depressed left ventricular systolic function with hypokinesis of
the basal inferoseptum and basal to mid inferior and lateral
walls. The remaining walls are akinetic. The LVEF was severely
depress
