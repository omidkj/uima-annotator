known idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are essentially unchanged
from prior. The cardiac silhouette is unremarkable. The osseous

IMPRESSION: No acute interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
As per the HPI, the patient was tachypnic upon admission. Per
the patient's wife, it was believed that his oxygen therapy was
insufficient at his rehabilitation facility. His mental status
was described as intermittently cogent in the ED, but this was
likely exacerbated by delirium [**1-27**] hypoxia, hypercarbia, and
hospital environment. He was seen by social work and palliative
care while still in the Emergency Department. He was monitored
overnight and his respiratory status was stabilized with
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. He was provided with
frequent re-orientation to his surroundings, and his wife was
consistently by his side helping provide reassurance. He was
evaluated by a hospice company and home hospice services were
set up. Breathing tubes, intravenous lines, and antibiotics were
not used, in concordance with the patient's wishes. He was
confirmed DNR/DNI, and remained so for the duration of his
admission.
