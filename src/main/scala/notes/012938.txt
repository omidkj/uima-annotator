Chief Complaint:
PEGJ occlusion and respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
40 yo M with IPF, s/p double lung tx [**2128**], h/o recurrent
pneumonia, chronic rejection and obliterative bronchiolitis,
polymiositis, recent hospitalization for acute on chronic resp
failure and multilobar pneumonia requiring chest tubes and PEJ
placement by IR (discharged on [**2133-2-26**]) presenting from Radius
[**Hospital 4094**] Rehab for PEGJ occlusion.  He was transported from
rehab to [**Hospital1 18**] ED using bag ventilation and was found to be
lethargic and disoriented upon arrival to the ED.
.
In the ED his vitals were temp 101, HR 117, BP 210/105, RR 33,
O2sat 89-95% and his ABG was 7.0/180/386.  He was then placed on
a ventilator in the ED and a repeat ABG was 7.24/89/71/40.  His
PEJ was repositioned by surgery in the ED without difficulty and
is ready to use.  He was brought to the MICU for resolution of
his respiratory distress. A repeat ABG in the MICU was
7.24/94/70. His ventilator settings are TV300 RR20 PEEP8 FiO2
40. It appears that he is now at his baseline with regards to
his ABG.
.
In the MICU his mental status is much improved.  He is alert and
oriented with no other complaints.  He denies any fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of breath.  He does
not feel disoriented or that his breathing is impaired.  He
feels hungry.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 yo male vent dependent with PEGJ occlusion requiring transfer
to the ED for eval by gen surgery and en route developing
respiratory distress with hypercarbia and acidosis.
.
# Severe respiratory acidosis: in the ED his ABG showed a ph of
7.0 with a CO2 of 180.  On his recent admission, his CO2 was
found to be as high as 200 and it seems that his baseline ABG is
7.2's/70's/100.
His repeat ABG's while on the ventilator at his normal settings
in the ED and in the MICU have returned to his normal baseline;
otherwise, continued vent settings and nebs from rehab.
.
# Infection: in ED patient was found to have temp of 101 with
WBC of 30; afebrile and WBC decreasing on admission to the MICU.
 on discharge from previous hospitalization([**2-26**]) WBC was 9 in
the setting of being in respiratory distress. At rehab was on
meropenem, Bactrim and Flagyl.  CXR in ED showed Patchy opacity
within the right base appears slightly more prominent when
compared to prior radiographs and may be related to underlying
fluid overload; however, superimposed infectious process cannot
be excluded. CXR showed a question of worsening pneumonia; U/a
was negative; blood culture and sputum culture were NGTD; LFT,
amylase, lipase normal; continued bactrim, flagyl, meropenem
plan for 1 more week to complete course.
.
# PEGJ repositioning: main reason for transfer to [**Hospital1 **] was for
repositioning/ occlusion of his PEJ. currently working
well-maintained on tube feeds.
.
# Altered mental status overnight: probable [**3-6**] multiple
sedating medications- Resolved o/n; nl EKG, trop, electrolytes,
ABG; discussed with patient in AM of HD1 when alert and he says
that he feels back to baseline.
.
#Anxiety and depression: continued seroquel, clonazepam,
morphine prn
.
# Lung transplant: continued cellcept, tacrolimus, nebs
.
# DM type II: tightened ISS, max glucose 220
.
# HTN: continue HCTZ, metoprolol
.
FEN: PEJ in place, TF at 50/ hr, replete lytes
.
Ppx: SC heparin, pneumoboots, PPI
.
Access: Right PICC, left PIV
