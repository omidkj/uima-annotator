HOSPITAL COURSE:  (by problem)

#1.  Acute pancreatitis:  Upon admission, the patient's white
blood cell ranged from 6.7 to 12.7.  Amylase was 1,374,
lipase 6,500, LDH 192.  LFTs were all normal.  Triglycerides
were 5,170, and cholesterol was 648.  The patient was
hydrated with 0.9 normal saline at 200 cc per hour and pain
controlled with morphine.  The patient was kept NPO and
called out to the floor on hospital day #2.  He was then
placed on a morphine PCA, kept NPO and IV hydration
continued.  Attempt was made to advance the patient to clear
liquids on hospital day #3, but this resulted in recurrent
epigastric pain so the patient was once again made NPO.
Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed perihepatic ascites,
but no biliary obstruction, dilatation, or gallstones.

On hospital day #5 the patient was started on PPN.  Because
of the need for total parenteral nutrition, an attempt was
made to place a PIC line, but it was unsuccessful.

The patient's epigastric pain gradually began to abate and
the patient was started on clear fluids on hospital day #9.
He was quickly advanced to full liquid and finally to a
normal [**Doctor First Name **] diet on hospital day #10.  At the time of
discharge, amylase and lipase were normal and triglycerides
were 230.  The patient was discharged on Tricor.

#2.  Diabetes mellitus:  Admission labs were as follows:
Urinalysis revealed ketones of 40, glucose of greater than
1000 and protein of greater than 300.  Blood glucose was 403,
bicarbonate 15, and the anion gap was 23.  Hemoglobin Alc was
11.6.

The patient was treated with an insulin drip at two units per
hour and the patient was hydrated with 0.9 normal saline at
200 cc per hour.  Anion gap closed within 48 hours and the
patient was transferred to the floor.  The [**Last Name (un) **] staff was
following the patient.  NPH insulin and regular insulin
sliding scale were used and adjusted as the patient went from
NPO to a full PO diet with good glycemic control achieved
throughout the hospitalization.  The patient received inhouse
diabetes education.  The patient was discharged to followup
with the [**Hospital 109687**] [**Hospital 982**] Clinic.

#3.  Left lower lobe pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion:
On hospital day #3, rales were ausculted in the base of the
left lung.  At this time, chest x-ray was read as left lower
lobe atelectasis with small left pleural effusion.  Also, at
this time, the patient's oxygen saturations were within
normal limits   The white blood cell count was 9.4,  He was
afebrile and without cough.

On hospital day #4, the patient's white blood cell count rose
to 12.  On hospital day #5, the white blood cell count rose
to 15.5.  At this time, blood cultures were drawn from the
patient, although he was still afebrile and without
localizing symptoms.

On hospital day #6, the patient's white blood cell count was
12.4.  He spiked a temperature to 101.  Repeat chest x-ray
revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate larger from the one
seen on previous chest x-ray and it was consistent with left
lower lobe pneumonia with effusion.  The patient was still
asymptomatic at this time.  Levofloxacin 500 mg IV q.d. was
started.  A left lateral decubitus film revealed a
significant (greater than 1.0 cm) freely layering left
pleural effusion.

On hospital day #9, the patient underwent thoracentesis.
Analysis of the pleural fluid revealed a pleural protein
level of 2.3 and pleural LDH of 153, compared to serum
protein level of 5.5 and serum LDH of 314.  Blood cultures
and pleural cultures demonstrated no growth.  The pH of the
pleural fluid was 7.68.

The patient was discharge on Levofloxacin to complete a
10-day course.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable for discharge home.
