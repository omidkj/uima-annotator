Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Transesophageal echocardiogram
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 426**] is an 80yo woman with h/o CAD s/p recent PCI, severe
AS s/p valvuloplasty [**4-/2174**], and recently treated for possible
pneumonia with ceftazidime [**Date range (1) 427**] admitted with shortness of
breath and hypotension.

Ms. [**Known lastname 428**] husband reports that he has observed her breathing
very fast around 3 or 4 in the morning for the last couple of
nights.  On the day of admissin, she woke up short of breath and
breathing quickly.  He used a stethoscope (which he has to help
with home maintenance) and heard a hissing/wheezing on her right
chest, which prompted him to call 911.  She continued breathing
fast until she was intubated in the ED with her consent.  He
notes that she has had a minimally productive cough since her
last admission, though she has not had fevers or chills.  She
had diarrhea for about a day recently, but this has resolved.
Her nephrologist contact[**Name (NI) **] her on [**6-16**] and advised her to
decrease her lasix from 160mg daily to 80mg because of her
rising creatinine.  Despite this change, her daily weight has
remained stable at 119-120 pounds.  She has been compliant with
1L fluid restriction.

In the ED, her initial VS were:  99.8   115   122/75   30s   82%
NRB.  She was noted to have crackles on her pulmonary exam.  She
was given rocuronium, etomidate, and versed and intubated
urgently.  Shortly after propofol gtt was started, she dropped
her pressures into the into the 70s (per report; recorded in the
80s).  Bedside Echo was done to evaluate for concern of
tamponade.  Echo demonstrated large anterior fat pad and stable
small loculated pericardial effusion.  Left cordis was placed
for hypotension; there was concern that the line might be in the
carotid, and CT was done to confirm placement.  Radiology
reports that the line is in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Pressures increased to 110s after 500cc IV fluid bolus.  She
received vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  +3 pillow
orthopnea, although she tends to move to flat position during
sleep.  She does not sore and her husband denies witnessed
apneas, though she has never had a formal evaluation.

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use; she smoked [**12-15**] PPD from age 18 to age 60. There is no
history of alcohol abuse; she occasionally has wine.  Uses a
walker; no recent falls.

Family History:
There is a family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death:  her father died of a heart valve problem at
age 52 and 4 of her siblings had heart problems (though not
valvular disease).

ABG 7.36/46/74 after intubation

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 122 with LBBB with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2174-6-6**].

TELEMETRY demonstrated:  Sinus tachy at 106

TTE [**2174-6-19**]:
The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF<20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is a small, primarily anterior
pericardial effusion most prominent around the right atrium and
right ventricle with a prominent anterior fat pad. No right
atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen (may be
absent in the setting of pulmonary artery hypertension).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-30**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly larger (but without
hemodynamic compromise) and left ventricular systolic function
is more depressed.

CXR [**2174-6-19**]:
A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the right
atrium.
An endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina. A
nasogastric tube
terminates past the stomach with its tip outside the plane of
imaging.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is
increased
perihilar haziness with interstitial fluid that is mostly
central. There is also increased peribronchial cuffing. There is
no evidence of pleural
effusion. Moderate S-shaped scolisosis is noted.
IMPRESSION: Acute central pulmomary edema.

CXR [**2174-6-19**]:
Newly inserted nasogastric tube projects over the stomach. The
tip
of the endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina. The size of
the cardiac
silhouette and the bilateral parenchymal opacities show no major
change.

CT Chest without contrast [**2174-6-19**]:
1. The left IJ introducer sheath is terminating in the proximal
left
brachiocephalic vein without immediate post-procedure
complications.
2. Diffuse bilateral septal thickening and ground-glass
opacities with
associated small bilateral pleural effusions suggesting moderate
pulmonary
edema. Bibasilar atelectasis and coexistent pneumonia cannot be
excluded and should be clinically correlated.
3. Comparative evaluation of pulmonary nodules is limited due to
respiratory motion and diffuse background pulmonary edema.
Further evaluation for stability should be undertaken p
