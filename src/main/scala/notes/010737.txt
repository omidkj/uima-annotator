Fall

None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19672**] is a 52-year-old woman with non small cell lung cancer
of the right lung and mets to brain and left lung currently on
Alimta (last dose [**2114-9-27**]), known PEs on lovenox, who initially
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital after a fall, was found to have
?new pulmonary emboli and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management, and is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory
failure.
.
She has a known history of gait unsteadiness, potentially
secondary to known brain metastatic disease, and was in her
usual state of health until yesterday when she sustained a fall
at home (per ED notes, she tripped on her rug). She presented to
[**Hospital **] hospital and was noted to be tachycardic and hypoxic.
Plain films of her spine demonstrated a T10 compression
fracture. She then underwent a chest CTA that demonstrated a
left segmental pulm artery PE, small saddle PE, right pleural
effusions, and ?right post-obstructive pneumonia. Head CT was
neg per report. She was given dilaudid and unasyn and
transferred for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: 97.9 134 135/92 19 94%4L. She
was was noted to be satting in the mid 90s on a NRB and in the
80s on room air. She refused a rectal exam. She was started on a
heparin gtt without a bolus, and she was given 1L NS, vancomycin
for post-obstructive pneumonia and dilaudid for pain. ED staff
discussed code status with her and she stated that she was DNI,
which incited disagreement between her and her husband. She was
also placed on cpap empirically for dyspnea and tachypnea in the
high 20s low 30s but did not tolerate it well per report. Of
note, ROS was neg for fevers, chills; positive for np cough.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Ms [**Known firstname 6177**] [**Known lastname 19672**] was 52 year old when on [**10-13**], [**2113**] presented with a generalized tonic clonic seizure while
driving. Workup with CT head and MRI's at outside hospital
showed brain lesions. A CT torso on [**2113-10-14**] showed lung lesions
including a right sided lung mass with associated right hilar
nodules. Biopsy of these areas showed adenocarcinoma that was
CK7+, TTF-1+ and CK20 negative consistent with non-small cell
lung cancer. She was determined to have metastatic lung cancer
with brain involvement. She was then seen at [**Location (un) 1121**] Cancer
Center from [**2113-10-26**] to [**2113-11-15**] and received 3000cGy whole brain
radiation. Her PCP is Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2127**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4754**]. She was seen on [**2114-1-15**]
by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and at that time, the patient was having headache,
nausea, vomiting, tinnitus and fatigue. She was started on
steroids, which controlled these symptoms. There was concern for

leptomeningeal disease by neuro-oncology on an outside head MRI,

hence Avastin was considered in the treatment regimen with
carboplatin and taxol. Patient started chemotherapy on [**2114-2-15**].
She is currently C3D18.
.
TREATMENT:
Carboplatin (6 AUC, D1), Paclitaxel (200 mg/m2, D1), Avastin
(15mg/kg, D1), every 3 weeks.
[**2114-2-15**] C1D1
[**2114-3-15**] C2D1
[**2114-4-5**] C3D1
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Migrained since her teens.
Cervical Cancer, status post cone resection [**2087**]
Benign thyroid nodule, removed in [**2093**], r thyroidectomy
Recent episode of herpses zoster, involving face, s/p acyclovir
course.


Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital1 **] with her husband and 26 y/o son. [**Name (NI) 1403**] as a
nanny, but is also an artist in her spare time.  Has smoked [**2-3**]

to complete obstruction of the proximal right mainstem bronchus.
The acute change from prior study suggests mucus plugging
superimposed to preexisting soft tissue.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19672**] is a 52-year-old woman with non small cell lung cancer
of the right lung and mets to brain and left lung currently on
Alimta (last dose [**2114-9-27**]), known PEs on lovenox, who initially
presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital after a fall, was found to have
?new pulmonary emboli who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxic respiratory
failure.

# Hypoxic respiratory failure/PE/pneumonia:
Hypoxic respiratory failure likely multifactorial with chronic
PE (from [**2114-4-2**]). OSH CTA was reviewed demonstrating no
change in PE size, and a R-sided post-obstructive PNA with
bilateral pleural effusions. Patient did not tolerate CPAP in
ED, was switched to NRB, then weaned to NC while in the ICU.
Vancomycin/Unasyn was started to cover for post-obstructive PNA
and bronchodilators were started. Her Enoxaparin was held and a
heparin gtt was started for her PE ppx. Switched back to
Enoxaparin on [**10-21**] when it was clear patient did not wish to
have any invasive procedures during her hospital stay. The idea
of a interventional pulmonology consult to attempt palliative
stenting was raised by primary oncologist with pt and family.
After consideration family decided not to pursue this route as
main goal was to get pt home as quickly as possible. Patient was
discharged on enoxaparin as patient did not feel it caused her
pain/inconvenience, and preferred to receive ppx against a PE.
.
# Non-small cell lung cancer of right lung:
Followed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and most
recently on alimta, with last dose [**2114-9-27**]. Known mets to left
lung and brain.  Underwent whole brain radiation in [**2114-11-2**] and
developed PEs while on Avastin in [**2114-4-2**]. Outpatient Onc
team notified of admission. Pt was continued on dexamethasone 4
mg daily and keppra. While in hospital goals of care discussion
was had with pt and husband. Pt stated the desire that getting
home quickly as possible was her primary goal of care and she
did not want medical intervention that would delay that process.
A palliative care consult was obtained and pt/family made
decision to go home with hospice.  Patient voiced that she might
wish to change her mind regarding palliative chemotherapy, but
at this time she did
