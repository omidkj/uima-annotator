History of Present Illness:
75 yo lady with hx of severe COPD on home O2, non operable NSCL
CA with nodule in LUL dx in [**2184**], s/p XRT, throid nodule, s/p
flex bronch today with radioactive seed implantation by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Procedure performed w/out complications and patient sent
home. CXR prior to procedure showed spiculated mass in the left
upper lung field retracting the left hilum with volume loss in
the LUL area and post procedure there was no evidence of
pneumothorax. There was no evidence of any pulmonary vascular
congestion or any other pulmonary parenchymal densities. Patient
now returns with increasing SOB. Patient apparently returned
home after procedure which was tolerated well, some hemoptysis
post procedure. Patient then "just didn't look well" as per
family, developed increasing SOB and brought to ED by daughter.
Family denies any other precipitating factors, has been well
previously, unable to elicit any other history from family.
.
In ED, patient with O2 sat of 95% on NRB, RR 35 therefore
patient intubated. No ABG done at that time. Tmax 99.8, SBP
initially stable at 110s, then decreased to 50s post intubation
and after receiving sedation. Lactate was 6.0, patient received
4 L of NS but did not respond therefore started on Dopamine and
Levophed. Also started on Vancomycin and Unasyn to cover oral
flora s/p bronch as well as post obstructive PNA given hx of
lung CA. CTA of chest was negative for PE but showed LLL
consolidation suggestive of atelectasis with stable LUL mass but
new opacities suggestive of aspiration vs. post obstructive PNA.
Right IJ central line was placed in the ED and the sepsis
protocol was initiated. Patient transfered to ICU sedated and
intubated on Levophed gtt at 0.18 mcg/kg/min. Upon arrival, VS
were T 98 HR 101 BP 102/60 O2 sat 100% AC 500 x 18 FiO2 100,
Peep 5, ABG 7.15/52/329


Past Medical History:
1. NSCL CA: non operable, no hx of chemotherapy as per family,
s/p XRT, s/p radioactive seed implantation, initial bronch in
[**2181**] was negative for malignancy, diagnosed in [**2184**] after mass
identified on CXR, PET positive nodule, also positive thyroid
nodule
2. Severe COPD/Emphysema requiring intermittent home O2, last
PFTs showing obstructive defect (FEV1/FVC 34)
3. HTN
4. Anxiety

Imaging:
CTA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval development of a left lower lobe consolidation. This
could represent atelectasis. Patchy opacities are also
visualized in the left lower lobe, which could represent
aspiration pneumonia.
3. Stable appearance of left upper lobe mass.
4. Interval placement of metallic objects within the mass and in
the adjacent areas.
.
CXR [**2187-7-31**]: Findings consistent within inoperable lung cancer
in left upper lobe. No evidence of pneumothorax following
bronchoscopy.
.
Repeat CXR post line placement: Satisfactory placement of right
internal jugular central venous catheter. Slightly increase
interstitial densities at the lung bases, raising the
possibility of CHF superimposed on COPD changes.
.
PET CT [**2187-7-2**]: Interval worsening in the region of a left upper
lobe linear scar (post XRT): on [**2185-1-21**] soft tissue mass measured
at 1.2 x 3.6cm with peak SUV 10.1, today 4 x 2.5cm & peak SUV
14.6. There is interval worsening posteriorly with increased
FDG-avidity and sclerosis of the posterior ribs. These are
consistent with tumor recurrence. 2) Focal area of FDG avidity
in the right middle zone (peak SUV 2.1 below our cutoff of 2.5)
that may represent infection. 3) FDG-avidity in paratracheal
region near right lower pole of
thyroid (peak SUV 15.1)


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo lady w/ severe COPD, non operable lung CA
s/p bronch with gold seed placement admitted with respiratory
failure and septic shock.
.
# Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated for worsening SOB,
increased work of breathing. CTA done in ED was negative for PE.
Respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration PNA vs. post
obstructive PNA s/p bronch with gold seed placement, new
opacities on CTA in LLL. Also with elevated WBC count with left
shift. Diffusely wheezy on exam, likely [**12-20**] to severe underlying
COPD. Also question of LLL segmental bronchus obstruction from
clot post procedure given history of hemoptysis and LLL
atelectasis on CTA. Patient treated with Unasyn for gram
negative and anaerobic coverage and Vancomycin since patient has
been in/out of hospital, instrumented, lives in retirement home,
to complete a 14 day course of each. The patient was also
treated with steroids for COPD exacerbation with hydrocortisone
and then Solu-Medrol with inhaled steroids. She was also treated
with Albuterol/Atrovent MDI through the ET tube with improvement
in her wheezing. Due to her severe COPD she required Albuterol
Q2 hrs and Atrovent Q 6 hrs, 8-10 puffs each. Blood cultures and
urine culture were negative. Sputum showed both gram positive
cocci and gram positive rods. After initial fluid resuscitation,
patient was diuresed, initially slowly due to borderline low BP,
then more aggressively. CXR does not show any evidence of fluid
overload. but shows the stable LUL mass with severe underlying
COPD. Patient has remained on ventilator throughout admission.
She has been weaned several times to pressure support of [**3-22**] and
