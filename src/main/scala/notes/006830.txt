Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization ([**2180-5-25**])

History of Present Illness:
This is a very pleasant 67-year-old blind and deaf male with
past history of HTN, dilated cardiomyopathy, h/o NSTEMI's,
Systolic failure (EF = 35%)CAD s/p 1) Left Anterior Descending
stent in [**2169**] (at the [**Hospital1 18**]), 2) ?Angioplasty in [**2171**] and 3)
balloon angioplasty with Cordis Cypher stent placement in the
3rd marginal as well as balloon angioplasty of the distal circ
on [**2177-4-29**] (at the [**Hospital1 2025**]). He is transferred here from [**Hospital 6451**] in the setting of recurrent chest pain for cardiac
catheterization.
.
The patient's broader cardiac past medical history begins in
[**2156**], at which time he was diagnosed with hypertension. In
[**2170-7-29**], he began experiencing chest pain while walking
and lifting heavy objects, prompting him to present to [**Hospital 6451**] Hospital. At that time, he characterized his pain as
chest tightening and burning, with associated radiation to his
neck, jaw and arms. ECHO during that admission showed concentric
LVH with an ejection fraction of 55-60%, mild AI, and no
regional wall motion abnormalities. A stress test performed
during that hospitalization revealed exercise to 90% of his
age-predicted maximum, limited by chest discomfort with
radiation to both arms as well as shortness of breath, with new
ST depressions in II, III and V6. In light of these results and
his recurrent pain c/w unstable angina, the patient was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2170-8-13**], the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization that revealed severe focal stenosis in the
proximal LAD. Dilation was successfully opened and stented with
minimal residual stenosis. Some moderate focal disease in the
proximal diagonal branch of the LAD was noted.
.
He subsequently underwent Angioplasty in [**2171**] (details are not
clear in the available records) and then balloon angioplasty
with Cordis Cypher stent placement in the 3rd marginal as well
as balloon angioplasty of the distal circ on [**2177-4-29**] (at the
[**Hospital1 2025**]).
.
Fast-forwarding to the present: the patient presented to his [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**2180-5-16**] and was told that he was not supposed to
recieve HD on that day. He refused to leave, complaining of
abdominal pain. While there, his pressure was noted to be in the
systolic 60s and 70's and he was said to be "somewhat confused".

.
The patient was therefore bolused and taken by ambulance to the
[**Hospital3 417**] ED, where he then complained of chest pain. Per
OSH records, troponins were slightly elevated, peak 6.89 -->
2.52. MB rose to around 37. ECG showed left bundle branch block
but no ST elevations. He was givin ASA, Morphine and Pepcid and
then started on a Nitro drip. The OSH notes state that the nitro
drip relieved the pain for a short time only, and in the context
of his presenting low BP's, presumed unstable CP as well as a
reported leukocytosis to 16.2, he was transferred from the ED to
the ICU to rule-out for MI as well as, per report, sepsis.
.
In the ICU, he ruled-out for STEMI. Heparin was NOT started in
the ICU because of a reportedly supratherapeutic INR (the value
is not stated in the OSH notes) reportedly without any history
of Coumadin use, although this seems peculiar given his reported
history of AFib. He received Vitamin K. He was transfused for
HCT = 25% --> 2 units --> 34% attributed to chronic blood loss
anemia with external hemorrhoids noted on exam. Although he had
a low-grade fever while there, cultures at the OSH showed no
growth times three. MRSA negative. No urine culture was taken
given anuria. The patient was started on Augmentin after dental
consultation for dental carries. He reportedly complained
throughout the hospitalization of heart-burn like symptoms. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital3 417**] arranged for cardiac catheterization
with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7047**], which is to take place tomorrow.
.
On arrival to the floor, VS: HR 74, SBP 105/59, RR 18, 95%RA.
The patient complained of continuing stomach burning and chest
pain, which he had great difficulty describing. He was able to
say that it was worse when he lied back, requiring him to sleep
with pillows on the couch at home. He admits to associated cough
and nausea. He states that there is a "funny" taste in his mouth
during these times. There does not seem to be a clear
correlation with meals. He noted that PO sucralfate makes his
discomfort much better, and repeatedly asked for this medication
during the interview. He admitted to non-specific arm pain in
both arms, but no back or jaw pain. ROS was otherwise negative
in detail.

Social History:
He denies tobacco or alcohol use. He is currently unemployed on

Family History:
Mother died of MI after age 80. Father died at 20's of an
unspecified brain "problem". Other family history is not known
by patient.

Physical Exam:
VS: HR 74, SBP 105/59, RR 18, 95%%A.
GEN: NAD, Supine in bed, smiling.
HEENT: NC/AT. MMM. Oropharynx clear. No oral abscess identified.

Pertinent Results:
EKG ([**2180-5-24**]):  Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality.
Borderline P-R interval prolongation. Intraventricular
conduction delay of left bundle-branch block type. ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

Cardiac catheterization ([**2180-5-25**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel CAD. The LMCA was non-obstructed. The
mid LAD had moderate in-stent restenosis. The LCX had widely
patent stents. The RCA had a recanalized chronic total occlusion
in the mid vessel with severe diffuse ahd heavily calcified
disease in the mid to distal vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic
arterial pressures.
3. Unsuccessful PTCA of the RCA chronic total occlusion.
4. Right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6 French
ANgioseal device.

EKG ([**2180-5-25**]):  Baseline artifact. Probable sinus rhythm. Since
the previous tracing limb lead voltage has diminished.
Otherwise, no change.

CXR 2V ([**2180-5-25**]):  Large dialysis catheter in place, cardiac
enlargement and evidence of moderate degree of pulmonary
vascular congestion with small amounts of pleural effusions.
Retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis. Followup examination
recommended to monitor improvement.

TTE ([**2180-5-26**]):  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
35%) with global hypokinesis and inferior/infero-lateral
thinning/akinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral regurgit
