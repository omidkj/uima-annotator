History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 103997**] is a 60yo M with history of CAD s/p PCI, hepatitis C
and DM who presents with two days of sweats and dizziness
described as lightheadedness.  Patient originally complained of
suprapubic pain.

In the ER, initial vitals were 96.2, 56, 72/52, 16, 96%.  He was
diaphoretic and pale.  Patient was given 1L NS with improvement
of his pressure.  He was found to have an inner thigh abscess
that was lanced and sent to CT A/P which showed small right
inner thigh abscess without deep or intrapelvic extension and
nodular liver.  When he returned, he was hypotensive again and
had agonal breathing.  He was intubated and R IJ was placed.
While in the ED, he received 1mg epinephrine while awaiting
better access and then 5L of NS, vancomycin, zosyn, 100mg IV
hydrocortisone, levophed, dopamine and phenylephrine.  He was
admitted to the MICU for undifferentiated shock.  Vitals on
transfer were P 70 bp 80/47, 95%v fio2 100, peep 10, tv 600 r 14
with ABG 7.32/46/145/25.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was intubated and sedated.

[**7-22**]:   HCV VIRAL LOAD (Final [**2183-7-21**]): 2,580,000 IU/mL.

[**7-24**]:  RAPID PLASMA REAGIN TEST (Final [**2183-7-24**]):
      NONREACTIVE.


[**7-7**] ECHO:  Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not
well seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Grossly preserved
biventricular systolic function. No pericardial effusion.

[**7-7**] CT AB/PEL:  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic pathology to
explain the patient's clinical circumstance with small area of
right groin induration status post incision and drainage.

[**7-7**] CTA CHEST:  Thyroid is normal in appearance. Patient is
intubated with endotracheal tube in appropriate position. Left
internal jugular catheter is seen with tip in the distal SVC.
Nasogastric tube is seen with side port at the level of GE
junction, could be advanced 5-7 cm. Coronary and aortic
atherosclerotic calcifications are noted. There is no
pericardial or pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis. The
lungs are otherwise clear. No pulmonary embolus or acute aortic
syndrome is identified. The aorta and major branches are patent
with a normal three-vessel arch. Trachea and central airways are
patent to segmental level. No mediastinal, hilar,
supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy is seen. Though
this study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation,
imaged upper abdomen demonstrates nodular liver concerning for
cirrhosis as mentioned.

[**7-15**] NCHCT:
1. No evidence of an acute intracranial process.
2. Fluid in the sphenoid sinuses and left posterior ethmoid, and

opacification of the mastoid air cells, which is most likely
related to
endotracheal intubation. However, given the patient's altered
mental status, please correlate clinically whether any sign of
infection may be present.

[**7-18**] CT TORSO:
CT OF THORAX: Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube
approximately 5 cm above the carina. A right-sided central line
tip is positioned at the
cavoatrial junction. The nasoenteral feeding tube tip is
positioned in the
distal second part of duodenum. Left-sided basal consolidation
hasworsened
since the prior study with complete consolidation and volume
loss of the left lower lobe. Consolidation involving the basal
segment of right lower lobe is stable. There are no pleural
effusions and no pericardial effusion.

CT OF ABDOMEN:
The liver has an irregular outline in keeping with established
cirrhosis.
Surgical clips in the gallbladder fossa are consistent with
prior
cholecystectomy. A 4-mm calcified focus in segment VI is likely
secondary to a calcified granuloma. Within limits of a
non-contrast study, there are no focal lesions. The pancreas
outlines normally. The spleen is slightly
enlarged measuring 15 cm in craniocaudal dimension. Normal
appearance of both kidneys and both adrenal glands. No
hydronephrosis. The aorta, internal and external iliac branches
are within normal limits. No aneurysm formation.

CT OF PELVIS: No pelvic free fluid. No enlarged inguinal or
pelvic lymph
nodes are identified. Soft tissue densities in the anterior
abdominal wall
likely represent injection sites. No pathologically enlarged
upper abdominal or mediastinal lymph node. Air within the
urinary bladder is likely secondary to instrumentation. Note,
the rectal drainage tube balloon is positioned within the
sigmoid colon.

There is mild stranding involving the medial aspect of the right
inner thigh at the site of a treated previous cutaneous
infection. No thigh fluid collection or hematoma is identified.

[**7-18**] PUNCH BIOPSY OF SACRUM:  Right lower back 4 mm punch.  60
year old man, intubated, status post multiple antibiotics now
with erythematous eruption with tiny pustules on buttocks and
back.  Differential diagnosis:  AG EP vs milleria pustulosa vs
candidiasis.

[**7-22**] EEG:  Abnormal portable EEG due to the low voltage slow
background throughout. This indicates a widespread
encephalopath
