Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o M w/DM, CHF, who presented to the ED tonight c/o weakness
and falls x 2 days. His wife brought him in, stating that the
past 2 nights, she has heard him fall. He hasn't lost
consciousness, but has been unable to get up after falling. His
wife also notes that he has been coughing for the past couple of
days, and she doesn't think he has been himself. She's noted
that he is confused when he wakes up in the mornings, for the
past 2 mornings, but this has resolved over the course of each
day. However, she brought him to the ED today due to his falls
and weakness.
.
In the ED, his vitals were 100.6, BP mostly 90s/50s but as low
as 86/44, P 60s, RR 18-22, O2 sat 89%RA and 100%3L. He had a
head/C-spine CT which were negative for any acute process. CXR
showed a new LLL infiltrate superimposed on a chronic-appearing
reticular process. A CVL was placed, with an initial CVP of 8.
He was given 500 cc NS (vs 2 L NS, unclear documentation), CVP
improved to 11. He was given tylenol and levofloxacin, and
admitted to the MICU.
.
Currently, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has no complaints other than he is thirsty.
He denies any headache, neck pain, chest pain, shortness of
breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, abd pain.


Past Medical History:
1. Type 2 DM
2. CHF, EF >55% on TTE [**2100**]
3. Symptomatic bradycardia s/p PPM [**2096**]
4. HTN
5. Gout
6. Glaucoma
7. s/p appy
8. s/p cataract surgery
9. Chronic dyspnea: Has been seen in Pulmonary [**10-8**], who felt
that his limitation in exertion was more related to
musculoskeletal problems. O2 sat at that time 94%RA, crackles
[**2-6**] way up on exam, likely IPF vs burnt-out sarcoid (had
respiratory illness in [**Country 651**] in his 20s) but since it was not
limiting him, did not pursue further treatment/workup.
10. Degenerative disc disease: severe at L5-S1 seen on plain
film [**12-9**]
11. ?prostate cancer: PSA elevated at 7.8 in [**4-8**]

.
EKG: v-paced
.
CXR [**2104-4-8**]: FINDINGS: The heart is again seen at the upper
limits of normal. A left-sided pacemaker is seen with leads in
standard position over the right atrium and right ventricle.
Bibasilar reticular opacities again identified consistent with
underlying interstitial lung disease such as IPF or collagen
vascular disease. A new opacity is identified in the left lower
lung field obscuring the left hemidiaphragm.
IMPRESSION:
1. New opacity within the left lower lung field with partial
obscuration of the hemidiaphragm consistent with pneumonia.
2. Bibasilar reticular opacities likely representing chronic
interstitial lung disease such as IPF or collagen vascular
disease.
.
Head CT [**2104-4-8**]: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of
the normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarct. There are age-appropriate involutional changes.
Moderate periventricular white matter hypodensity is consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemia. A hypodensity in the right
basal ganglia likely represents a chronic lacunar infarct. The
overlying soft
tissues are unremarkable. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. There is _____ mucosal thickening of the frontal,
ethmoid, and maxillary air cells. Mild mucosal thickening as
well as likely air-fluid levels are seen within the sphenoid
sinus.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
3. Right basal ganglia lacunar infarct, likely chronic.
4. Paranasal sinus mucosal thickening as well as air-fluid
levels within the sphenoid sinuses which can be seen in the
setting of acute sinusitis.
.
C-spine CT [**2104-4-8**]: On sagittal images from the skull base to the
T2 vertebral bodies is clearly visualized. There are no
prevertebral soft tissue abnormalities. There is no fracture.
There is loss of the normal cervical lordosis. Mild grade 1
retrolisthesis of C5 on C6 and C6 on C7 is likely degenerative.
Moderate to severe degenerative changes are noted of the
cervical spine manifested less prominently at the C4 through C6
vertebral body levels by disc
space narrowing and large anterior osteophytes. At C2
uncovertebral joint, hypertrophy results in left neural
foraminal narrowing. Bilateral neural foraminal narrowing is
also noted at the C5 and C6 levels as well as mild spinal canal
stenosis. Scattered cervical chain lymph nodes do not meet CT
criteria for pathologic enlargement. Small bullae are seen at
the right lung
apex.
Again seen are air-fluid levels within the sphenoid sinus and
maxillary mucosal thickening.
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture.
2. Moderate-to-severe degenerative changes of the cervical spine
resulting in multilevel neural foraminal narrowing and mild
spinal canal stenosis.
3. Air-fluid levels in the sphenoid sinuses, which can represent
acute sinusitis in the proper clinical setting.
4. Loss of normal cervical lordosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: [**Age over 90 **] y/o M w/DM, CHF, who presents with weakness, confusion,
and cough, found to be hypotensive in the ED.
.
1. Hypotension/Pneumonia:  It was thought that his hypotension
was due to volume depletion in the setting of infection
(pneumonia) and his anti-hypertensives. His BP improved with
IVF. CXR showed a LLL PNA and he was treated with levofloxacin.
He should complete a 7 day course for CAP. A chest CT was done
as CXR showed evidence for pulmonary fibrosis that was confirmed
on CT. He should follow up in pulmonary clinic with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 216**]
on [**2104-6-27**] at 3:00.
.
2. Confusion: Initially confused on arrival. Likely secondary to
hypovolemia +/- infectious process as patient's mental status
returned to baseline with return of blood pressure and treatment
with levofloxacin for pneumonia. He was alert and oriented upon
discharge.
.
3. Hypoxia: Oxygen saturation was 89% on RA in ED, but returned
to 99% on room air with improvement of hypotension and
antibiotic therapy. He did have occasional brief desaturations
while sleeping but would rapidly return to baseline. the patient
likely has some component of obstructive sleep apnea in addition
to his chronic lung disease.
.
4. Frequent falls: Per clinic notes, pt is very unsteady on his
feet, and ambulates with a walker at home. [**Month (only) 116**] have been
somewhat confused, and fell in setting of not using walker.
Given low BG levels, hypoglycemia may have also played a role.
The patient denies loss of conciousness or syncope. However, it
remains an unclear picture as the pt is not a great historian.
Head CT and C-spine are negative, no other signs of trauma on
exam. See
