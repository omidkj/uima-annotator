Admission Date:  [**2111-8-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2111-8-9**]

Date of Birth:   [**2053-1-4**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 58-year-old
white male with a history of coronary artery disease (status
post recent percutaneous coronary intervention on [**2111-7-31**] with placement of two SIRIUS moving stents in the mid
left anterior descending artery) who presented with 10/10
substernal chest pain.

The patient was sitting down this morning when he had the
sudden onset of crushing chest pain.  He took sublingual
nitroglycerin times three without relief of the chest pain.
He came to the hospital with electrocardiogram changes
(specifically anterior T wave peaking) and was referred for
catheterization.

The patient was found to have a total occlusion of his mid
left anterior descending artery and 90% stenosis of the
second obtuse marginal.  The mid left anterior descending
artery stenosis was in the region of the recently placed
stents.  Integrilin was initiated.  Angio-Jet catheter was
advanced to the distal [**Year (4 digits) **] which appeared to have a large
dissection.  Two overlapping stents were placed in the mid
left anterior descending artery.  Angiography demonstrated no
residual stenosis or evidence of dissection.

The patient was pain free after catheterization.  The second
obtuse marginal with the 90% lesion was noted to be stable
from the prior catheterization.  The left circumflex was
patent.  A right heart catheterization was not performed.

The patient was currently without chest pain.  He denied
palpitations or shortness of breath and was resting
comfortably.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (15);
(a)  In [**2102-10-21**] mid left anterior descending artery
stenting.
(b)  In [**2104-5-21**] - second obtuse marginal [**Year (4 digits) **] placed.
(c)  In [**2110-5-21**] - second obtuse marginal [**Year (4 digits) **] placed and
proximal circumflex Hepakote [**Year (4 digits) **] placed.
(d)  In [**2110-8-21**] - diagonal percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty.
(e)  In [**2110-11-21**] - diagonal rotablation and brachy
therapy.
(f)  In [**2111-3-21**] - mid left anterior descending artery
[**Year (4 digits) **].
(g)  On [**2111-7-31**] - mid left anterior descending artery
[**Year (4 digits) **] times two.
2.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
3.  Anemia.
4.  Coronary artery disease.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Type 2 diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to MORPHINE.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Plavix 75 mg by mouth every day.
 3.  Atenolol 50 mg by mouth once per day
 4.  Lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day.
 5.  Hydroquinone 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
 6.  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Sulfasalazine 500 mg by mouth twice per day.
 8.  Protonix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Vitamin E 400 units by mouth every day.
10.  Iron supplements 325 mg by mouth every day.
11.  Cardizem 120 mg by mouth once per day.
12.  Prednisone 7 mg by mouth once per day.
13.  Caltrate 600 mg by mouth once per day.
14.  Celebrex 200 mg by mouth twice per day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking approximately 20
years ago.  No recent alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history is positive for coronary
artery disease.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was started on aspirin,
lisinopril, Pravachol, atenolol, Plavix, and heparin  status
post catheterization.

The patient denied any further chest pain.  There was concern
for hypercoagulability in the setting of in-[**Year (4 digits) **] thrombosis
as evidenced on cardiac catheterization; however, a workup
revealed normal levels of protein C and protein S.
Homocystine was within normal limits.

The patient was noted to have a left femoral hematoma and
left femoral bruit status post catheterization.  The distal
pulses remained intact.  An ultrasound was performed showing
evidence of an arteriovenous fistula in the left groin
without pseudoaneurysm.

The patient was seen by Vascular Surgery who advised to
continue monitoring bruit and distal pulses.  Vascular
Surgery advised that surgery was not indicated at this time.

The patient had an echocardiogram performed which revealed an
ejection fraction of 25% to 30%.  No left ventricular masses
or thrombi were evident.  However, left ventricular wall
motion with evidence of dyskinesia and akinesia.

The thought was to anticoagulate the patient; however, there
was concern for a bleed in the setting of femoral hematoma
and bruit.  The patient's hematocrit decreased to 26.  He was
transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells with an
evaluation of hematocrit to 30.6.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**8-6**].  The
patient was noted to have episodes of hypotension with blood
pressures of 80s/40s.  The patient remained asymptomatic.  He
denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  The patient
was started on intravenous fluids and moved back to the
Coronary Care Unit for his episodes of hypotension.  The
patient continued to receive intravenous fluids.

The concern was that the patient had been taking prednisone
for the past 10 years and had recently self-weaned himself
from steroids.  However, in the setting of hypotension and
decreased a.m. cortisol, concern for adrenal insufficiency,
the patient received 4 mg of Decadron with minor improvement
in his blood pressure.  A cosyntropin stimulation test was
performed showing resultant cortisol of 22.6 after
stimulation.  Therefore, the patient was likely to have
secondary adrenal dysfunction.  The patient was reinitiated
on prednisone 20 mg and was to receive a slow taper.

On discharge, the patient's hematocrit was 31.3.  Blood urea
nitrogen was 16 and creatinine was 1.2.  The patient was
without any further chest pain.  The electrocardiogram
changes had resolved.  The patient's femoral hematoma was
resolving, and his blood pressures were stable.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.
