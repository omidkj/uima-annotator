History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is an 81-year-old woman with a history of
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, nonallergic rhinitis,
chronic sinusitis, and chronic cough who presents with cough,
wheezing, and shortness of breath.  Per the patient, she
developed an increasing cough over the last week associated with
wheezy.  She was seen in [**Company 191**] on [**4-30**] and was sent to the ED for
evaluation due to the concern of hypoxia to 94% and possible
ischemia based on an EKG.  She was admitted overnight (discharge
summary not complete) and treated for asthma exacerbation
(although no clear history of this) with nebs and steroids, and
advair was added back to her regimen.  She went home on [**5-1**] and
started to wheeze again.  Her granddaughter called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
on [**5-2**] because they thought she was supposed to be on a steroid
taper, but was not discharged on steroids.  He prescribed a
short steroid burst which she started taking on [**5-2**] with mild
improvement.  However, last night her wheezing got much worse
and she couldn't stop coughing due to her GERD and nasal drip.
She normally feels SOB when coughing, but otherwise did not feel
SOB.  She was concerned about her wheezing and presented to OSH
for evaluation.  Of note, she denies PND but does not like to
lie flat because her coughing worsens.  She states that the only
time she feels SOB is when she is coughing, and the coughing
fits can happen either at rest or with exertion, and there is no
pattern.  The coughing worsens if she has a URI or allergy
symptoms.  Additionally, when asked what is more concerning to
her, her audible wheeze or feeling SOB, she states the wheezy is
her most prominent and concerning symptom and that the SOB is in
the setting of the cough.  No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.
No chest pain, palpatations, weight gain, or LE edema (edema
improved).

Vitals recorded by EMS were 146/52, 82, 18, 100%. At [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital she received duoneb, Solumedrol 125mg and magnesium.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] where initial vitals were 96.7, 73, 162/90,
20, 98% on 4L.  CXR initially thought to have LLL infiltrate and
received ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but radiology later read
it as normal.  Was audibly wheezing and received an additional
125mg IV solumedrol and multiple rounds of albuterol and
atrovent nebs.  Flu sent and was negative.  EKG with new ST
depressions in V4-V6, CE's negative.  Recieved 500cc IVFs and
100mg thiamine.  ABG prior to BIPAP was 7.37/40/109.  Received
BIPAP for one hour with some improvement in symptoms. Of note
lactate 5.5 to 5.3 to 8.2 over 6 hrs, unclear etiology as no
abdominal pain, hypotension, not felt to be septic physiology.

Currently the patient is without complaints.  She is not SOB or
wheezy and feels much better when compared to presentation.  No
chest pain.

Pertinent Results:
[**2145-5-4**] CXR: IMPRESSION: No interval changes since [**2145-4-30**]. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2145-5-5**] 2D ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2143-6-13**], the
degree of pulmonary hypertension detected has slightly
decreased.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  The patient is a 82 y.o.f. with nonallergic rhinitis,
sinusitis, post-nasal drip, GERD, chronic cough and wheezing,
HTN, hypercholesteremia, and CAD who presents with cough and
wheezing.

# Cough/Wheeze/SOB ?????? Significant workup as outpatient with
possibly some component of asthma based on flow/volume curves on
recent spirometry.  Seems that most of the complaint is from
hearing herself wheeze which further exacerbates the cough which
then leads to SOB.  Post nasal drip present causing cough, as
well as GERD.  She was
