Past Medical History:
Colonoscopy [**2184-3-25**]:
>Polyp in the transverse colon (polypectomy) - adenoma
>Polyps in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)- Colonic mucosa with
focal hyperplastic features
>Polypoid, ulcerated mass in the hepatic flexure (biopsy) -
Superficial fragments of colonic mucosa with ulceration, marked
acute inflammation, and highly atypical glands, suspicious for
carcinoma.


Past history:
# Colon mass during colonoscopy for guaiac positive stools in
[**2184**]. Pathology was worrisome for carcinoma. Although the
patient was offered resection by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], he declined
# hematuria/BPH - traumatic foley insertion and manipulation
[**3-16**] lead to urosepsis and subsequent urinary retention
# sick sinus syndrome and bifascicular block s/p pacemaker [**2184**]

# PAF - on amiodarone, not on coumadin d/t concern for
malignancy
# H/O SVT
# Atrial flutter status post ablation [**2-/2186**] - not on
anticoagulation d/t concern for malignancy
# Anemia - on arenesp and iron
# Echo [**2186**]: mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, RA and LA
# BPH s/p TURMP [**2187**]
# b/l edema with skin changes
# hard of hearing
# hx of guiaic positive stools/GI bleeding
# osteoarthritis
# osteoporosis
# subclinical hypothyroid state as per record
# renal insufficiency
# right pleural effusion - Found on CT on [**2188-2-25**] for increasing
DOE. [**3-6**] and [**3-18**] thoracentesis c/w transudative. Workup during
last admission revealed RV diastolic dysfunction. Concern was
for PE as etiology, but unable to get CTA d/w ARF and V/Q not
helpful. Not anticoagulated due to h/o GIB, pleurodesis not an
option d/t transudative.
# Tibial talar dislocation with comminuted distal tib fib
fracture status post surgery [**2181**]
# hx syncope in [**2181**], unclear etiology

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 87 y.o.m. with multiple medical problems
including untreated colon cancer, BPH, chronic foley, afib,
diastolic heart failure and chronic right sided pleural effusion
who presents with fevers/chills, hypotension, and urinary
retention from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

# Hypotension - Believed by ICU team to be secondary to
preseptic physiology secondary to UTI and melena.  Resolved
after volume resuscitation and treatment of UTI.

# GIB -Patient with melena on presentation. EGD [**5-12**] revealed a
single non-bleeding erosion in the antrum of the stomach.

# Urinary retention - Etiology from traumatic foley placement
during admission in [**2-29**], followed by urology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3748**] as
an outpatient.  Foley currently draining well without clots
after manipulation overnight. Continue BPH meds.  Outpatient
urology f/u.

#UTI) [**5-10**] urine culture no growth but patient with symptoms of
UTI and equivocal u/a in setting of hypotension with indwelling
foley and thus was presumptively started on abx by ED and ICU.
Will complete 7 day course of abx.

C. Difficile Colitis)  Patient developed during his
hospitalization.  Flagyl po for 14 days total.

# CKD - Currently at baseline.  Cr 1.1

#Colon CA)  Patient underwent colonoscopy on [**5-15**] that revealed
pseudomembranous colitis, two polyps and his earlier colonic
mass at the hepatic flexure.  Per GI, there is concern for
future risk of obstruction from mass.  Patient now appears more
interested in discussing surgical options.  Patient to f/u in
Dr.[**Name (NI) 8788**] clinic.  Oncology service noted no role for
solitary chemo given size of mass.
