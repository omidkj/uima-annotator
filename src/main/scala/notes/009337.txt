History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 74 yo M with history of COPD(on home O2 4L NC) who
presented to [**Hospital3 7569**] with SOB and productive cough for
several weeks.  History was obtained from the records as the
patient was intubated.  At [**Location (un) **] he was noted to have sats in
the low 80's.  There CXR showed right sided pleural
effusion(concerning for an empyema).  He was started on
azithromycin, ceftriaxone, 125mg solumedrol and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Per his wife he had been having pain in his right groin for
about a week.  Pain improved with ibuprofen (800mg [**Hospital1 **] for 3
days) and heating pad.  Pain migrated up to his right side of
the chest wall.  Has lost about 15 pounds over the last 2 weeks.
 No fevers, chills.  Has been having cough with a small amount
of sputum and occasionally blood.  He developed worsening SOB
over last 24 hrs.  At baseline is SOB/DOE and on 4L NC.
Decrease PO's over this time.

.
[**3-14**] CXR:
 FINDINGS:  Compared with 04/16, allowing for differences in
position, the left pleural effusion is probably not
significantly changed.
.
The multifocal infiltrates in the right mid and lower lung
fields appear to have become more confluent superiorly.
Persistent retrocardiac collapse/consolidation.
 .
The visualized portions of the left lung are grossly clear.  No
CHF
.
[**2-25**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Complex-appearing right pleural effusion, with loculated
components.  The pleura does not clearly enhance, thus this
loculated effusion is not necessarily an empyema.
2.  There is dense consolidative change with cystic spaces
within the right lower lobe.  The finding is concerning for a
cavitating pneumonia.  However, this lung parenchyma is not
evaluated for an underlying mass lesion, and one cannot be
excluded.
3.  Severe emphysematous changes of the lungs.
4.  Scattered nodular opacities within the left lung.
Three-month CT followup is recommended.
5.  Small pericardial effusion.
6.  5 cm arterially enhancing mass of the liver at the
confluence of hepatic veins, not characterized. When the
patient's condition improves, if he is able to breath hold, a
contrast enhanced MRI is recommended. If he cannot breath hold,
multiphase CT is recommended.
.
[**3-4**] RUQ U/S:
 ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  The liver is normal in echotexture.
Multiple hepatic cysts are seen, the largest of which is in the
right lobe measuring 4.3 x 3.8 x 4.3 cm.  Additionally, there is
a hypoechoic solid lesion in the lateral aspect of the right
lobe measuring 5.2 x 5.6 x 4.7 cm.  This lesion has a central
feeding artery.  Multiple small stones are seen within the
gallbladder and the wall is thickened measuring 3 mm, however
this is likely related to
hypoalbuminemia as there is a small amount of ascites and large
left pleural effusion.  The gallbladder is not distended.
Common hepatic duct measures 1.3 cm and the pancreatic duct is
also mildly dilated measuring 0.3 cm.  No discrete pancreatic
head mass is identified.  The portal vein is patent with
anterograde flow.  Limited views of the kidneys demonstrate no
hydronephrosis. An additional solid hypoechoic vascular mass is
seen above the left kidney measuring 3.3 x 2.6 x 3.4 cm.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Solid hypoechoic masses are seen in the right lobe of the
liver and above the left kidney, concerning for metastases.
Recommend CT of the abdomen for metastatic work-up, or hepatic
MRI if there is clinical concern for a primary hepatocellular
carcinoma.
2.  Multiple hepatic cysts.
3.  Dilatation of the common hepatic duct and pancreatic duct
with no discrete mass seen in the pancreatic head.  Again, this
could be evaluated with abdominal CT.
4.  Cholelithiasis and gallbladder wall edema, likely related to

hypoalbuminemia.
5.  A small amount of ascites and large left pleural effusion.
.
[**3-1**] ECHO: EF 75-80%
Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular  systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
right ventricular cavity is  mildly dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**2-25**] Pleural fluid negative for malignancy
.
[**3-19**] CT Abd/Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1.  Poorly defined predominantly hyperehancing mass within the
medial right
hepatic dome just to the right of the IVC surrounding and
narrowing the right
hepatic vein. CT imaging characteristics are not specific but
differential
includes hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma or even a
solitary
metastasis. Further charactherization of this mass is
recommended with MRI.
2.  Complex right lower lobe empyema/parapneumonic effusion.
There is an
adjacent right lower lobe consolidation.
3.  Decrease in the more simple-appearing left pleural effusion
and left lower
lobe atelectasis.
4.  Gallstones.
5.  Several left upper quadrant splenules.
6.  Multiple hepatic and renal cysts.
7.  Descending a
