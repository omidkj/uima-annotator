none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 49411**] is a 83 yo Russian-speaking male with a history of
three vessel CAD, sCHF, AF, AS, DM, CKD and a history of
aspiration events, recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU
service who re-presents from his rehab facility to the ED today.
Around 10AM on the day of admission, the patient was noted to
acutely desaturate and his rehab and become lethargic. Initial
ABG demonstrated 7.34/50/54. His supplemental oxygen was
increased and he was eventually placed on NIPPV. His PO2
increased to 93 with this but he remained somnolent. He was also
noted to become hypotensive with SBPs in the 60s, shortly prior
to his transfer to the ED. He was given 250cc NS bolus x 2 for
this and for poor urine output. He was also noted to have
tremulous extremities.
.
In the ED, the patient was found to be hypoxic, with sats in the
70s on 100% FiO2, as well as hypotensive to the 60s systolic. A
chest x-ray was concerning for CHF. The patient was intubated
for progressive respiratory distress. A femoral line was placed
and he was started on dopamine and Levophed for blood pressure
support after receiving 3L NS. His serum K was noted to be
elevated and he was treated with Ca, insulin, glucose and
bicarb. He was also emperically treated with ciprofloxacin and
Flagyl.
.
The patient's most recent admission was for evaluation of
hypotension in the setting of receiving SL NTG despite his known
AS. His hospital course was complicated by hematuria, a UTI, and
a new diagnosis of frequent aspiration. Just prior to that [**Hospital1 18**]
admission, he had been hospitalized at [**Hospital3 **] medical
center for an NSTEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock. During
that hospitilization, PCI for the patient's known CAD was
attempted but could not be performed. While on the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU
service, the patient's [**Hospital3 **] cath films were obtained
and reviewed by both interventional cardiology and cardiac
surgery; he was not felt to be a candidate for
revascularization.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient is somnolent and unresponsive
to painful stimuli. ROS is unable to be obtained.

EKG: Sinus bradycardia at 59. NA; first degree AV delay. LBBB.
Compared to prior tracing from [**2138-7-27**], QRS duration is wider
and QRS axis has shifted to the right.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
([**2138-7-18**]) The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. LV systolic function
appears depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to
akinesis of the posterior wall and anterior septum, and
hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**2138-8-2**]):
1. Moderate congestive heart failure with small bilateral
pleural effusions.
2. Bibasilar opacities may reflect atelectasis, but infection is
not
excluded.
.
CT C/A/P ([**2138-8-2**]) (PFI):
Pulmonary edema, bilateral plueral effusions. Fluid in trachea
and bronchi concerning for aspiration. Gallbladder severely
enlarged with stone in neck may relate to cholecystitis. US
should be considered for further evaluation.
.
CT Head ([**2138-8-2**]) (PFI):
No acute intracranial pathology; chronic small vessel ischemic
changes; fluid in the nasopharynx likely due to intubation.
.
PFTs ([**4-14**]):
Mild obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced FVC may be due
to gas trapping but a coexisting restrictive defect cannot be
excluded. Suggest lung volume measurements if clinically
[**Month/Year (2) 9304**]. Compared to the prior study of [**2137-12-27**] the FVC has
increased by 0.35 L (+16%).
.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 yoM with multiple medical problems including extensive CAD,
AS, sCHF, AF, DM and CKD presents from rehab with lethargy,
hypoxic respiratory failure and hypotension. Pt was brought to
the CCU intubated and on pressors. Some ECG changes were noted
on admission, likely due to pt's significant acidemia. Pt was
significantly fluid overloaded by CXR. Exact precipitant was
unclear but pt was given cautious diuresis. Pt was
simultaneously hypotensive, on dopamine and levophed. Hypoxic
respiratory failure/respiratory acidosis/question aspiration
persisted and vent settings had to be maximized. Pt's muscle
fasciculations continued in CCU, likely related to his uremia or
hyperkalemia.
Despite aggressive medical management, pt's condition continued
to deteriorate rapidly in the CCU. A family meeting was called
where goals of care were discussed and patient made DNR/DNI. Pt
was found unresponsive, without electrical activity on cardiac
monitor and with no pupillary reflex. Pt expired at 4:19 am on
[**2138-8-3**] w/ pt's wife present at the bedside. Medical
Examiner declined the case and autopsy declined by the family.
