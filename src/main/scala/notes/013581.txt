Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old
gentleman with no previous cardiac history who was admitted
to an outside hospital on [**2162-9-30**] with a one week
history of increasing shortness of breath with chest pain.
On [**10-1**], he underwent an exercise tolerance test which
was positive.  He ruled out for myocardial infarction by
enzymes.  Cardiac catheterization performed on [**10-4**]
revealed a 70% left main occlusion with a 90% left anterior
descending and 70% ostial circumflex, 70% ramus, 50%
posterior descending artery and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 57%.  This is per his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3503**].
He was transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**] for surgical evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a three year history
of asthma.  The patient states he has had no wheezes or
coughs but has had intermittent episodes of shortness of
breath.  The patient also comes with a history of psychosis,
unclear etiology and unclear symptoms although the patient
says he has been well controlled on his current medications.
Status post eye muscle surgery [**98**] years ago.  Status post
nasal fracture from a motor vehicle accident.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with his
wife.  [**Name (NI) **] works parttime.  He is a nonsmoker with very rare
alcohol intake.

MEDICATIONS:  Trilafon 24 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Cogentin 1 mg p.o.
q.h.s., Advair 250/50 b.i.d., Albuterol metered dose inhaler
prn.

Medications from the outside hospital upon transfer also
included Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Nitropaste, Lopressor 25 mg t.i.d., Plavix 75 mg q.d., Zocor
40 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination upon admission
was unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory values upon admission to the
hospital were also unremarkable.  He ruled out for a
myocardial infarction by CPKs and troponins and his
electrocardiogram upon admission showed no acute ischemic
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was subsequent taken to the
Operating Room on [**2162-10-5**], by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
where he underwent coronary artery bypass graft times two
with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending and saphenous vein to the obtuse marginal.
Postoperatively he was transported to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit in good condition on Nitroglycerin,
Neo-Synephrine and Propofol intravenous drip.  The patient
remained on Nitroglycerin drip despite some marginal
hypotension due to small target vessels and some coronary
arteries which were unable to be revascularized fully due to
his anatomy.  The patient also required insulin for a short
term in the Intensive Care Unit.  On the night of surgery hew
as weaned from mechanical ventilator and extubated
successfully.  On postoperative day #1 he remained in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on Neo-Synephrine,
Nitroglycerin and insulin drip.  On postoperative day #2, the
patient remained hemodynamically stable.  He was transitioned
from Nitroglycerin drip to p.o. Imdur and was ultimately
transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the Telemetry
Floor.  On postoperative day #3, the patient was alert,
intact and ambulating.  He did receive one unit of packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 23 on postoperative day #3.
He continued to progress with ambulation as well as cardiac
rehabilitation.  Cardiac consultation was obtained due to
questionable Q waves in the inferior leads with some vague
shortness of breath symptoms on examination.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 47897**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] was consulted and he felt that there were no acute
issues that needed to be addressed at that time and
recommended follow up as an outpatient.  The patient
continued to progress well and remained hemodynamically
stable, continued to increase ambulation and cardiac
rehabilitation, remained in normal sinus rhythm and today,
[**10-11**], postoperative day #6 he is stable to be
transferred home.

Physical examination today is as follows:  The patient is
afebrile, he is in the normal sinus rhythm with a rate of
about 90.  His blood pressure is 100/60.  Room air saturation
is 95 to 97%.  Neurologically he is alert and oriented with
no apparent deficits.  On pulmonary examination, his lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His coronary
examination is regular rate and rhythm.  His abdomen is
benign.  His extremities are without edema.  His sternal and
leg incisions are clean and dry with no drainage or erythema.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times one week
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times one week
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., this is for the poor quality of
his targets as well as small coronary arteries.
6.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. q.d. as well for his coronary
vasculature.
7.  Lopressor 37.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Perphenazine 24 mg p.o. q.h.s.
10. Cogentin 1 mg p.o. q.h.s.
11. Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d.
12. Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

FOLLOW UP:  He is to follow up with his primary care
physician in two to three weeks, he is also going to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 47897**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] in two to three weeks and he is to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks.
