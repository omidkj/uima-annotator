HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 54 year old white male was
noted to have tachycardia during an injection for chronic
back pain.  He was admitted for rule out myocardial
infarction.  During the rule out, he continued to have
persistent tachycardia.  An echocardiogram at that time
revealed severe aortic stenosis and he was referred for
cardiac catheterization.  He is asymptomatic at rest and has
dyspnea on exertion, extreme exertion like running.  He has
had chest pain a few times over the past six months.  The
echocardiogram revealed an aortic valve area of 0.5
centimeter squared and his peak gradient was 60 mmHg.  He
underwent cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital1 190**] on [**2199-5-6**], which revealed normal coronaries
and an aortic valve area of 0.5 centimeter squared with a
mean gradient of 60 and an ejection fraction of 40 to 45
percent and one to two plus mitral regurgitation.  He is now
admitted for elective aortic valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of chronic back pain.

History of depression.

History of aortic stenosis.

History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Status post excision of chest wall tumor in the left tenth
rib space.

Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2. Effexor 150 mg p.o. once daily.
3. Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.


ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife and is a fire
fighter.  He quit smoking thirty years ago and drinks five to
six drinks per week.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His family history is significant for
coronary artery disease and valvular disease.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  As above.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, he is a well-
developed, well-nourished white male in no apparent distress.
Vital signs are stable, afebrile.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.
Extraocular movements are intact.  The oropharynx is benign.
The neck was supple with full range of motion, no
lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly, carotids two plus and equal
bilaterally without bruits.  The lungs had bilateral
scattered rhonchi.  Cardiovascular examination - regular rate
and rhythm with a III/VI systolic ejection murmur heard best
at the apex.  He had a well healed surgical scar on his left
lateral chest.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, with
positive bowel sounds, no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities were without cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Pulses
were two plus and equal bilaterally throughout with the
exception of the femorals which were one plus bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted on [**2199-5-20**], and underwent
an aortic valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 66683**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve.  He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU on Neo-Synephrine and Propofol.  He
was extubated on his postoperative night and had his chest
tubes discontinued on postoperative day number one.  He was
transfused two units of blood on postoperative day two for a
hematocrit of 21.5.  He was ready to transfer to the floor on
postoperative day number two when he felt a [**Doctor Last Name **] in his chest
and had severe subcutaneous emphysema across his chest and
through his face.  He had a right pneumothorax and had a
right chest tube placed that had an air leak.  On
postoperative day number three, he was transferred to the
floor.  He continued to stay on suction with his chest tube
and was otherwise in stable condition.  He remained on
suction and was beginning to be anticoagulated.  He had his
chest tube discontinued on postoperative day number five.  On
postoperative day number six, he had a slight pneumothorax on
the right again and became acutely short of breath on
postoperative day number seven with a large pneumothorax.  He
had a Cook catheter placed and had full expansion of his
lung.  He was then fully anticoagulated and had to have his
INR drift down.  His Cook catheter eventually became clotted
off and he began to have a pneumothorax again.  On [**2199-5-31**],
he underwent a right VATS procedure with a bleb resection and
talc pleurodesis. He tolerated this procedure well and had
his chest tube discontinued three days following that and was
anticoagulated again and his lung remained expanded following
chest tube removal.  On postoperative day number sixteen and
five, he was discharged to home in stable condition.

His laboratories on discharge showed a white blood cell count
12.6, hematocrit 26.6, platelet count 576,000.  Sodium 136,
potassium 4.0, chloride 98, CO2 30, blood urea nitrogen 12,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 129.  Prothrombin time 17.8, INR 2.1.
