History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62F with multiple medical problems, most
significantly IgA nephropathy status post renal transplant with
subsequent graft failure and graft removal [**7-7**], now back on
hemodialysis
(Tu, [**Last Name (un) **], Sat), Hypertension, primary hyperparathyroidism s/p
resection who
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with confusion in the context of
hypertension.  Of note, she has had two similar episodes earlier
this year.  On presentation, the patient was confused an unable
to give a cohesive story, so the history was taken from the
patient's husband and the online medical record.

According to her husband the patient had dialysis the day prior
to admission without any problems.  The morning of presentation
the patient awoke in her usual state of health.  The husband was
unclear but it seemed as though she may have missed her morning
doses of medications.  Around 2pm the patient began to become
increasingly agitated and confused, stating "I want to go home"
even though she was at home. The husband gave her some labetalol
and tylenol without improvement.  Multiple efforts were made at
redirecting her but without success and she was brought to the
ED for further evaluation.

In the ED initial vitals were as follows: T 98.2  HR 83  BP
222/144  RR 22  O2sat 98%RA.  She was found to be combative. She
was placed on a nitroprusside drip and given haldol and ativan
for agitation.  They were unable to obtain a head CT due to
agitation so the patient was intubated and sedated with propofol
and a head CT was performed; the preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was
negative for bleed.  Chest XR with mild pulmonary edema, EKG
with LVH, NSR at 73, no evidence of ACS.

Pertinent recent medical history course as per [**Location (un) **]:
From [**Date range (1) 77609**], she was admitted to the surgical service for pain

over transplant site.  Initially given antibiotics (Vanc/Cipro)
for line infection and UTI, renal US showed signs of graft
rejection, was hypertensive (up to SBP 220s) treated with
labetalol and valsartan. She was asymptomatic from the elevated
BPs and underwent transplant nephrectomy on [**7-13**] without
complications.

From [**Date range (1) 106065**], she was admitted for Hypertensive urgency (BP
222/107) with no chest pain, EKG unchanged, cardiac enzymes
negative, and clear CXR.  BP was 178/82 status post 10 mg IV
hydralazine x 3.
She had a mild headache, confusion, agitation, and decreased
muscle strength in upper left extremity (CT of head, MRI head,
MRA of head and neck were negative).  After getting home dose
meds (which consisted of valsartan, amlodipine, and labetolol)
her BP came down to 167/78.  Labetalol was titrated up from
600mg [**Hospital1 **] to 800mg [**Hospital1 **].  Additional incidental finding of
lymphocytosis was noted at the time.

From [**Date range (1) 106066**], she was initially admitted for febrile to 103
with associated diarrhea and cough.  Initially covered with
pip/tazo and linezolid for a possible HAP, later held as not
evidence of infection.  She had presistent Diarrhea with C. Diff
negative,
had 500 cc BRBPR with continued passing of clots.  (NOTE: [**5-7**]
EGD and colonscopy showed internal hemorrhoids and
diverticulosis of the entire colon.)  She had active LGIB w/
diverticular disease of entire colon. GI was unable to scope due

to bleed. IR was unsuccessful at selective catheterization of
the right colic artery.  She recieved a total of 6 units of
PRBC.  she had right colectomy ([**8-23**]) for lower GI bleed, had
side-to-side functional end-to-end ileal colostomy.  She had a
relative uneventful postoperative course except for some
confusion probably related to elevated serum calcium (addressed
by nephrology) and incisional cellulitis (discharged on Keflex).


[**9-1**] - [**9-7**], for altered MS s/p HD, relatively lethargic and
confused. She was otherwise hemodynamically stable and also
found to have a blood glucose(BG) of 27.  She was given 3 units
of insulin for sugar of 160. Patient is not a diabetic.

[**Date range (1) 106072**] the patient was admitted with a similar picture of
confusion in the setting of hypertension.  She had normal
serum/urine tox, B12, RPR, ca.  LP findings were within normal
range and HSV negative.  Patient refused MRI and EEG which were
recommended by primary team and neurology.  It was determined
that her confusion was likely due to a combination of poor
nutrition (improved with Thiamine), hypertension, hypoglycemia,
and possibly hypothryoidism.
