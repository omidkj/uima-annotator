History of Present Illness:
This 63 year old male presented to an outside ED on [**2156-9-23**] for
4 weeks of gradually worsening dyspnea and chest discomfort and
was noted to be in heart failure. He was given ASA, sl
nitroglycerin, Bumex and Avalox. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
futher treatment after his dyspnea improved.He underwent right
and left cardiac catheterization. He was noted to be in flutter
after  DCCV. [**9-29**]. Echocardiography showed severe aortic
stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7 cm2, mean gradient 27 mmHg, peak gradient 42
mmHg).

On catheterization he was noted to have 100% distal RCA
occlusion with left to right collaterals to distal vessel, LAD
30% proximal stenosis, otherwise diffuse disease distally with
probable distal occlusion of apical LAD.  30% stenosis of OM1.
Aortic valve with peak aortic gradient of 40 mmHg, area 0.6 cm2.
Right heart cath with PASP 51 mmHg, PCWP 23 mmHg, RVEDP 21 mmHg.
Consultation for evaluation of coronary bypass and aortic valve
replacement was obtained.

rhonchi.
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. +BS.

Pertinent Results:
[**2156-9-30**] Echo Pre CPB: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15
%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There are bilateral pleural effusions.
The cardiac output is 2.0L/min. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results. Post CPB: The cardiac output is
4.0L/min. The patient is on an epinephrine infusion. There is a
well seated mechanical valve in the aortic position. There is a
tube graft in the ascending aorta. The visible contours of the
thoracic aorta are intact. The aortic valve has a mean gradient
of 7mmHg and no insufficiency. There is trace/mild MR, which
appears slightly improved.
The left ventricular ejection fraction is improved at 25-30%.

Brief Hospital Course:
He underwent right and left cardiac catheterizations  for
evaluation of his disease. He was noted to be in atrial flutter.
 Echocardiography showed severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7 cm2,
mean gradient 27 mmHg, peak gradient 42 mmHg. Catheterization
noted  100% distal RCA occlusion with left to right collaterals
to distal vessel, LAD 30% proximal stenosis, otherwise diffuse
disease distally with probable distal occlusion of apical
LAD,30% stenosis of OM1. Aortic valve with peak aortic gradient
of 40 mmHg, area 0.6 cm2. Right heart cath with PASP 51 mmHg,
PCWP 23 mmHg, RVEDP 21 mmHg. He was referred for surgical
evaluation.

After preoperative workup, he was taken to the Operating Room
where surgery as noted was performed. See operative note for
details. He weaned from bypass on Neo-Synephrine and Propofol.
He weaned from these and was extubated on POD 1.  He became very
agitated and confused, pulling out his mediastinal and right
chest tubes resulting in a pneumothorax. A right tube was
replaced due to a pneumothorax.  Valium was administered for
alcohol withdrawal treatment and he his agitation subsided.
Sedation was decreased, he remained stable and CTs were removed
on [**10-5**]. Sedation was stopped on [**10-6**].

Diuresis was institued and beta blockers were resumed.
Metoprolol was changed to Carvedilol due to his low ejection
fraction. Anticoagulation with coumadin was started for
mechcanical AVR. He also experienced post-operative atrial
fibrillation and was treated with amiodarone.

As he lives alone in a rooming house and has no social support,
is anticoagulated for mechcanical AVR and recovering from
surgery, a stay at rehabilitation was deemed appropriate.  He
will need an INR of 2.5-3.5 as a target. His wounds were clean
and healing well at discharge.

[**2156-10-8**] INR 2.7- needs to 2mg coumadin today.
NEXT INR draw [**2156-10-9**]
