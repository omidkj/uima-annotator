Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB and nausea.  Found to have polymorphic VT shortly after
admission.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
76 yo female with hx of afib s/p recent dofetilide and DCCV,
HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with nausea. Pt was
admitted to NEBH [**Date range (1) 32334**] during which she was given tikosyn
initially 500mg [**Hospital1 **] and had DCCVx2 with success and discharged
on 250mg [**Hospital1 **]. She continued to take her medications at home at
8am and 8pm without missing a dose or taking extra doses. She
felt well until 2d PTA when she awoke with worsening SOB which
progressed throughout the day. This evolved into nausea and at
4pm had an episode of nonbloody nonbilious emesis after which
SOB resolved. She report some chest tightness w/o palpitations
or chest pressure, no presyncope but did report feeling
feverish. She denied dysuria but did have urinary frequency and
notice mild nonproductive cough. She awoke with similar symptoms
this am with nausea again at 4pm so presented to NEBH ED. In the
ED she was thought to have mild CHF with UTI. She was given a
dose of Levofloxacin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
treatment as there were no available telemetry beds. She was
directly admitted to the floor and vital signs were initially
stable. She developed worsening SOB, hypertension and sinus
tachycardia so was given metoprolol 5mg IV and 20mg IV lasix,
and nitroglycerin gtt with improvment in her SOB. She then
developed bigeminy and eventual runs of nonsustained
polymorphinc VT so was transferred to the CCU for further
treatment.

Admission CXR:
Bilateral interstitial infiltrates consistent with edema.
.
Echo: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging  suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right  ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta  is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There  is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The  mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is  seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery  systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
[**6-30**]: RHC and cardiac cath
1. Selective coronary angiography ofthis right dominant system
revealed
2 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild disease. Teh
LAD had
minimal disease. The LCX had a 50% stenosis distal to the
previous
placed stent. The RCA had a moderate 50% lesion in the mid
vessel.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures, systemic hypertension and mild pulmonary
hypertension. There was no transoartic gradient upon pullback of
the
catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Pressure wire interrogation of teh mid RCA lesion with
infusion of IV
adenosine revealed an FFR of 0.86 suggesting a non
hemodynamically
significant lesion.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated filling pressures.
3. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
4. Systemic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 76 yo female with hx of afib s/p recent dofetilide and
DCCV, HTN, hyperlipidemia who presented to OSH with nausea now
transferred to the CCU for polymorphic VT.  Hospital course by
problem:
.
#) Rhythm: Pt had markedly prolonged QT due to dofetilide and
exacerbated with quinolone use. Pt also had very prolonged PR
interval. Telemetry revealed polymorphic VT so she was
transferred to the ICU.  She received magnesium and potassium to
treat Torsade de Pointes.  All QTc prolonging agents were held,
including the dofetilide.  We monitored her lytes closely and
obtained serial ECGs.  Her QTc improved considerably to the
normal range.  Tele demonstrated that she was then going into
AVNRT and we were concerned that she would revert to Afib.  Amio
and metoprolol were added to her regimen.  She was seen by the
EP service and we determined to treat her afib medically to
remain in sinus.  We bridged patient with heparin while
inpatient but restarted coumadin upon dispo.  We discharged
patient with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor to *************
.
#) CAD: Pt was chest pain free with mild elevation in CE at OSH
likely related to tachycardia. New lateral TWI were noted on the
ECG after her TDP.  They were thought to represent memory T
waves from automated ventricular rhythm prior to admission.
However, given her persistent TWIs and her slight troponin leak,
she was considered an NSTEMI and was brought to the cath lab
after plavix, heparin, asa, metoprolol, and statin.  Report as
above.  She received balloon angioplasty of her RCA.  Otherwise,
no LAD lesion noted.
.
#) Pump: Pt was in acute CHF clinically as corroberated by
elevated BNP and CXR on admission.  This was thought [**2-11**]
arrhythmia and improved when her rhythm improved.  She was
temporarily treated with a nitro gtt for BP control and lasix
for diuresis.  Her symptoms improved.  TTE as above.
.
#) Hyperlipidemia:Cont on pravastatin
.
#) HTN: Held on HCTZ in setting of adjusting cardiac meds.
.
#) DM: Held on glipizide and covered with humalog sliding scale.
 Home regimen restarted on dispo.
.
#) Hyperthyroidism-on stable dose of levothyroxine for extended
period of time.  TSH normal.
