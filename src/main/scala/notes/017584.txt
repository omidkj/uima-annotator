[**2181-4-29**] CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIA
IMPRESSION: Extensive fragmentation of the mandible, with
numerous radiopaque foreign bodies located adjacent to the
mandibularfragmentation, likely reflecting bullet fragments. No
additional fractures areidentified.




[**2181-5-1**] MANDIBLE SERIES INCLUD PANOREX
This exam consists of a single Panorex view of the mandible plus
six
additional radiographs. There are markedly comminuted bilateral
fractures of both mandibular bodies. These fractures are
associated with a large amount of metallic shrapnel. Teeth of
both the maxilla and mandible have been surgically fixated and a
nasogastric tube is partially visualized. We have no previous
comparison radiographs at this facility. Mandibular condyles and
adjacent rami are intact and maxillary sinuses normally aerated.






Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. OMFS was consulted given
his mandible fractures. He was taken to the operating room on
[**4-30**] by Trauma Surgery for an open tracheostomy and by OMFS for
repair of his mandible fractures and extraction of fractured
teeth. There were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively he was taken to the Trauma ICU where he remained
for several days on the ventilator. A nasogastric tube had
already been placed and tube feedings were initiated. He was
eventually weaned from the ventilator and was transferred to the
regular nursing unit.

Speech and Swallow were consulted for Passy Muir valve; initial
attempts failed secondary to increased airway edema. He was kept
NPO for several more days and a bedside swallow was done for
which he passed. His tracheostomy was downsized and he was
placed on a full liquid diet. The NG tube was removed; he
continued to tolerate his full liquid diet without any
difficulty. The tracheostomy was then removed.
His pain was controlled with oral narcotcis elixir.

He was followed closely by Social Work and the Center for
Violence Prevention and Recovery for a safe discharge plan.
Information regarding victim's compensation was provided to him
and his family.
