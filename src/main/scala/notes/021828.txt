Radiology Report FEMORAL VASCULAR US LEFT PORT Study Date of
[**2171-7-20**] 2:31 PM

FINDINGS:

[**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler images of the left common femoral vein
and artery were
obtained. There is normal wall-to-wall flow in the visible vein
and artery.
A small hypoechoic region anterior to the common femoral artery
likely
represents the area of the thrombosed pseudoaneurysm. No
recurrence is noted.

IMPRESSION:

No recurrence of left common femoral pseudoaneurysm.

TRACING #4

Radiology Report UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT Study Date of
[**2171-7-19**] 10:52 AM
FINDINGS: There is an approximately 2 cm left common femoral
artery
pseudoaneurysm.

After discussion with the patient and description of the risks
and benefits,
the left inguinal area was prepped and draped in a sterile
fashion. Under
ultrasound guidance, a 20-gauge spinal needle was advanced into
the periphery
of this patient's pseudoaneurysm after which approximately 500
units of
topical thrombin were injected. There was complete thrombosis of
the
pseudoaneurysm and persistent patency of the underlying common
femoral artery
and vein. The patient's peripheral exam on the left did not
change after
thrombin injection.

Assessment for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis was also
requested.

Duplex and color Doppler demonstrated normal augmentation,
compressibility and
flow involving the common femoral, superficial femoral,
popliteal and proximal
tibial veins on the left.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm successfully
treated with 500
units of topical thrombin without complication.

2. No evidence of left lower extremity DVT.

BRIEF HISTORY:   89 year old female with prior cardiac work-up
in
preparation for TKR. Underwent diagnostic cath at [**Hospital1 86939**] revealing 90% distal Lmain disease. Given history of
chest
discomfort at rest, and comorbidities is forward on for PCI with
Impella
support.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Known left main coronary disease. Triple vessel coronary
disease.

PROCEDURE:
Bilateral femoral access was obtained in preparation for
percutaneous
coronary intervention with Impella device. With assistance of
Micropuncture technique, 6F right femoral arterial access, and
8F venous
access were obtained. A 5Fr pigtail catheter was inserted
through the
right femoral arterial access and was positioned in the distal
aorta.
Power injection aortogram revealed no significant disease of the
distal
aorta or iliofemoral system on either side. Left femoral access
was
obtained via micropuncture. It was then preclosed with 2 6Fr
perclose
devices, and the sheath was upsized to the 13Fr Impella sheath.
Access
to the left ventricle was obtained via pigtail catheter and J
wire. This
was then exchanged for the Impella wire. The Impella was prepped
and
inserted into the LV under fluoroscopic guidance.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
