Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo F with type 2 Diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia admitted
with iron deficiency anemia, hyperkalemia, and COPD exacerbation

#Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation:
Patient was found to have a COPD exacerbation at PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. She
was started on prednisone and bronchodilators and continued on
these inpatient. She improved and was able to ambulate without
desaturation prior to discharge. She was discharged on a
prednisone taper along with prior home medications.

Patient was found to have a hematocrit of 17 and was noted to
have ST depression on EKG that resolved with transfusion of 3
