Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 45820**] is a 52 yo M with hypertension and dyslipidemia,
transferred from [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2158-3-4**] with STEMI,
[**Location (un) 7622**] to [**Hospital1 18**], cath lab. Woke up this morning at 2 AM with
left sided burning chest pain, different from the pain he
experienced with his recent STEMI. Also was noted to be
diaphoretic. No N/V. He presented to the ED, where he was HD
stable except for a few episodes of SBP to the 90s which
resolved with fluid bolus. He received nitro and morphine which
improved his pain only minimally, and was started on a heparin
drip. A troponin was done and noted to be improved since
discharge: 5.82 -->5.2 --> 3.19 now. CK also trended down: 657
--> 220.
.
On evaluation on the floor, vitals were: 107/76, 69, 16, 96% on
2L NC. EKG showed NSR at 64 bpm and no acute ST or T wave
changes. CXR showed resolved pulmonary vascular congestion and
no newly developed consolidation. He reported some nausea, but
thinks that this is secondary to anxiety. He states that his CP
is quite similar to "gas pains" he has had in the past, but
given his recent MI felt he warranted evaluation. He endorses a
bit of diaphoresis at home, but no SOB, arm pain, jaw pain, DOE.
 CP is not worse with movement.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45820**] is a 52 yo M with history of mild hypertension and
dyslipidemia who presented on [**2158-3-4**] with his first symptomatic
STEMI found to have significant coronary disease involving all
major vessels.  He is s/p PCI of the LCx with BMS and is being
worked-up for CABG given extent of disease. He was admitted to
[**Hospital1 1516**] after experiencing chest burning at home.
.
# CORONARIES: No prior known CAD until STEMI this month.
Catheterization from [**2158-3-4**] revealed significant RCA, LAD
(including diagonal)and LCx disease with stent placement to the
LCx. Given extensive disease, the patient is being worked up for
CABG. Now with new onset of chest pain. This could represent
thrombosis, although unlikely given medical management post-PCI
and timing.  More likely due to his known gas pains since they
are so similar, but given recent MI, must rule out anginal pain,
post-MI pericarditis or effusion. No leukocytosis or fever to
suggest Dressler's syndrome, plus timing would be fast for this.
- Continued Plavix, statin, beta [**Last Name (LF) 7005**], [**First Name3 (LF) **].
- CT [**Doctor First Name **] had been following re: CABG. (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] Plan was
for patient to undergo CABG in approximately one month. They
were made aware of this admission.
- Trended enzymes given new CP, seen to trend down.
- Pain control with acetaminophen and morphine prn.  Will NOT
use NSAIDs to treat pain even if pericarditis is suspected, as
studies have shown that anti-inflammatory agents may lead to
scar thinning and infarct expansion.  This information was
shared with the patient and his wife, [**Name (NI) **].
- Compazine prn for nausea. Ativan prn for anxiety (pt reports
feeling anxious). Maalox prn for gas pains/heartburn with
improvement in his symptoms.
.
# PUMP: Echo from [**2158-3-6**] showed mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral akinesis and LVEF
of 40-45%. Patient appeared euvolemic on exam. No indication to
repeat echo at this admission as patient is hemodynamically
stable and most recent echo was done only 3 days prior to this
admission.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient was noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation
intracath and was DC cardioverted to NSR with a single shock.
Also had torsades and ventricular ectopy peri-MI. In NSR this
admission.
.
Continued his other home medications.
.
Code status confirmed as full code this admission. The patient
has follow-up scheduled with cardiology as an outpatient. He was
deemed medically stable and fit for discharge to home on
[**2158-3-9**]. He had no changes to his medication regimen with the
exception of the addition of prn ativan for anxiety or insomnia.
