Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 42326**] was admitted on [**2163-11-25**] to the urology service under
the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**]. A CXR showed a left pleural effusion and
LLL atelectasis. She was placed on Zithromax for a presumed LLL
pneumonia. Over the next 2 days, her blood cultures from the ED
grew gram negative rods. Gentamycin was added, and plans for the
OR were cancelled. A medicine consult was obtained to help work
up her bacteremia, continued tachycardia, new hypoxia on RA, and
ongoing emesis. A CTA of her chest showed no evidence of a PE
but increasing bilateral pleural effusions.  On [**2162-11-29**], Ms.
[**Known lastname 65022**] care was transferred to the medical service due to her
multiple medical problems.
  Surgical consultation was obtained for abdominal distension
and pain.  CT scan confirmed a colonic perforation with stool
and PO contrast in the abdominal cavity.  After much
deliberation by the patient and family, it was decided to
undergo operative intervention.  The patient was brought
emergently to the operating room and had a sigmoid colectomy/LAR
with end colostomy and Hartmann's procedure and jejunal feeding
tube placement.  For details of this, please see the previously
dictated operative note.
  Post-operatively, the patient did well and remained in the ICU
for vent weaning.  On post-operative day #2, the patient was
noted to have copious serous drainage from the inferior aspect
of her wound.  The wound was locally explored and fascia was
intact.  Continued drainage, however, prompted re-evaulation of
the entire wound in the operating room which was found to be
intact.  For details of this, please see the previously dictated
operative note.
  Otherwise, the patient had a fairly unremarkable hospital
course.  She extubated uneventfully and was transferred to the
floor.  She tolerated jejunal tube feeds and bedside and video
swallow evaluation showed some risk of aspiration which is
controlled via chin tuck maneuver.  The stoma is healthy and
functions well.  IV antibiotics were continued for a two week
course, and transitioned to PO for an additional one week.
