Service:  CT SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year old female
with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on
[**2134-5-25**], for urgent cardiac catheterization.  The patient
initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on [**2134-5-24**], with
the chief complaint of chest pain.  The patient had recently
been noted to complain of chest pain to her primary care
physician and had been treated on an ongoing basis for
suspected diagnosis of costochondritis.  Upon review at [**Hospital3 15516**] Hospital, the patient was noted to have elevated CPKs
ranging from 220 to 621 and elevated troponin ranging from
2.2 up to 39.6.  At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, the patient was
admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit and started on Integrilin,
after which point she became pain free.  The patient was
thereafter noted to have several episodes of intermittently
worsening chest pain that was responsive to Nitroglycerin and
Morphine therapy.  The patient was subsequently transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] on [**2134-5-25**], for an
emergent cardiac catheterization procedure.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a widow with one child who is
very involved in her care.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the C-Medicine
service on [**2134-5-25**], and scheduled for emergent cardiac
catheterization.  Her subsequent catheterization demonstrated
severe left main and three vessel disease with a right
dominant system.  The left main coronary artery was noted to
have distal bifurcation 90% stenosis.  The left anterior
descending was noted to have a 70% ostial lesion and diffuse
50% disease in the midsegment.  The left circumflex has an
80% ostial occlusion.  The right coronary artery was noted to
be a large caliber dominant vessel with a 60% ostial lesion
and 50% stenosis in the distal segment.  An intra-aortic
balloon pump was subsequently placed via the right femoral
artery without difficulty.  Follow-up cardiac catheterization
on [**2134-5-26**], demonstrated ejection fraction of 55%.

Following extensive discussion with the patient and her
daughter with regards to the risks and benefits of surgery,
the patient was subsequently scheduled for coronary artery
bypass graft procedure on [**2134-5-26**].

On [**2134-5-26**], the patient underwent an off pump coronary
artery bypass graft with anastomosis left internal mammary
artery to the left anterior descending.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  The patient's pericardium was
left open; lines placed included an arterial line and a
Swan-Ganz catheter, in addition to the intra-aortic balloon
pump placed preoperatively; both ventricular and atrial wires
were placed; both right and left pleural tubes were placed
intraoperatively.  The patient was subsequently transferred
from the operating room to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit,
intubated, for further evaluation and management.  On
transfer, the patient's mean arterial pressure was noted to
be 81, her CVP was 14, PAD was 20 and [**Doctor First Name 1052**] was 27.  The
patient was AV paced at a rate of 67 beats per minute.
Active drips on transfer included Nitroglycerin and Propofol.

Shortly following transfer to the CSRU, the patient was
successfully weaned and extubated.  Her postoperative
hematocrit was noted to be 31.0.  Examination demonstrated
her to be afebrile and stable.  Given the extent of the
patient's coronary artery disease, the patient was returned
to the cardiac catheterization laboratory on [**2134-5-28**], for
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting
of the left main with a drug diluting stent.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well with successful placement of a
3.0 by 13mm Cypher stent in the left main into the left
circumflex.  The patient progressed well in the CSRU through
postoperative day number three, at which point she was noted
to demonstrate an abrupt diminution in her urine output
accompanied by diffuse abdominal pain and distention.
General surgery consultation was obtained and an acute
abdomen workup conducted.  Of note, abdominal CT demonstrated
no acute intra-abdominal processes.  The patient was
subsequently made NPO and fitted with a nasogastric tube with
gradual resolution of the patient's abdominal symptoms.  The
patient's oliguria was deemed secondary to an exacerbation of
her underlying chronic renal insufficiency; a renal
consultation was obtained, intubation, which recommended
conservative therapy.  The patient continued to progress well
clinically through postoperative day number five, at which
point she was noted to suffer from acute respiratory
distress, requiring emergent reintubation in the CSRU.   The
patient was returned emergently to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory, where she was noted to have
persistent native three vessel coronary artery disease, with
a widely patent anastomosis and a widely patent left main
stent.  Upon discussion with renal consultation team, the
patient's respiratory distress was believed to be secondary
to a failed attempt in respiratory compensation for
underlying metabolic acidosis secondary to the patient's
chronic renal insufficiency.  The patient's underlying
chronic renal insufficiency was believed to be exacerbated by
her exposure to intravenous contrast loads and relative
hypotension through the course of her operative procedures
and catheterizations.  The patient was subsequently treated
with multiple rounds of hemodialysis in order to compensate
for her acute on chronic renal failure with good effect.  The
patient continued to progress well clinically on hemodialysis
through postoperative day number eight, [**2134-6-3**], at which
point she was successfully weaned and extubated.  The patient
was subsequently successfully weaned off all pressors in the
CSRU on postoperative day number ten; however, on
postoperative day number eleven, [**2134-6-5**], the patient once
again required intubation secondary to hypoxemia.  The
etiology of her hypoxemia on this occasion was believed to be
secondary to fluid overload, for which the patient received
continued hemodialysis with good offloading.  On
postoperative day number twelve, the patient was started on
tube feeds and, following aggressive continued diuresis, was
again successfully extubated.  The patient was thereafter
noted to demonstrate gradual improving renal function with
aggressive diuresis and required no further episodes of
emergent intubation.  The patient thereafter was advanced
from tube feeds to oral intake without complication.  The
patient continued to progress well clinically through
postoperative day number fifteen, at which point her chest
tube and pacer wires were removed without complication and
she was cleared for transfer to the regular floor.  The
patient was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic
service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  On the
floor, the patient's postoperative course was uneventful and
she progressed well.  Following a failed voiding trial, the
patient required reinsertion of a Foley catheter, which
remained in place through the duration of her stay.  On
postoperative day number sixteen, the patient complained of
transient bilateral calf pain; subsequent bilateral lower
extremity ultrasound demonstrated no evidence of deep vein
thrombosis and the patient's pain was noted to resolve
gradually with increased ambulation.  The patient was
evaluated by physical therapy, who deemed her appropriate for
short term rehabilitation following discharge.  The patient
was
