Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4219**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation, lumbar puncture, insertion of CVL

History of Present Illness:
52 yo female, h/o hyperlipidemia, DM, HTN, presenting after
returning from [**Country 11150**] with fever of unknown origin.  Pt
originally presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**12-15**] day after
returning from [**Country 11150**].  As per their notes, she had been feeling
unwell since the 2nd leg of her flight, with symptoms of fever,
chills, diffuse muscular pain, HA, weakness, and rigors.  Her
husband, who was still in [**Name (NI) 11150**], had similar symptoms that were
resolving.  She was in a rural area in Inday, bitten by many
mosquitos, and had stitches place in her left ear for a
stretched piercing.  She had denied diarrha, photophobia, nuchal
rigidity, nausea; she had been complaining of pain in the left
ear x 1 day.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], she was found to be febrile to 103.5,
hemodynamically stable with a HR=130.  UA was negative,
bld/urine cultures were drawn (and remain negatibe), and Hct was
40.3, plts 210, WBC=3.9.  She had a mild transaminitis.  EKG
showed LBBB (thought to be old), and thick/thin smear was
negative for parasites.  LP was not performed/felt to not be
clinically indicated.  She was started on ceftriaxone 2 mg, and
monitored.  Further workup included hepatitis serologies
(pending), TTE which showed severely depressed EF=25%.  She had
mild drop in hematocrit/plts.  She did not improve and was
intubated on [**12-16**] [**2-22**] hypoxic respiratory failure (?flash
pulmonary edema vs. ARDS).  Doxycycline was added to medication
regimen, 1 dose of PO quinidine was administered.  SBP dropped,
and she was started on dopamine with stabilization of her BP and
resumption of urine output.  CT of the head was performed and
was negative for any acute process.  Upon the wishes of family,
she was transferred for [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Upon transfer, she had a brief episode of hypotension upon
transfer that responded to fluid bolus.  She remains on dopamine
gtt, propofol gtt, insulin gtt and is saturating adequately on
AC ventilation.  She was febrile to 101 on transfer.

Relevant Labs/Studies:

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Fever:  She initially presented to the OSH with fevers (as
high as 105.0).  Etiology for this was explored at length.
Blood, urine cultures (including fungal and mycolytic cultures)
were drawn and were persistently negative.  Stool cultures were
also sent and remained negative.  Thick/Thin preps were prepared
and were negative for parasistes x 6.  Although she did receive
1 dose of quinidine and 1 dose of malarone, therapy for malaria
was discontinued given low likelihood of this.  LP was performed
upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] and was negative for signs of infection.
Hepatitis serologies were sent, BAL was sent for viral/bacterial
organisms, and legionella urinary antigen was negative.  Dengue
fever and leptospirosis were also sent.  She was started on
Ceftriaxone, Vanco, Ampicillin, Azithromycin initially upon
presentation to [**Hospital1 18**].  Ampicillin was discontinued with
negative LP results. She eventually defervesced.  Cause of
febrile illness was likely a viral source.  All antibiotics were
stopped after 4-5 days given lack of a source.  All serologies
(leptospira, hepatitis, mycoplasma) were negative, Dengue still
pending.  She respiked with evidence of an infiltrate s/p failed
extubation and was started on vanco/zosyn for VAP.  She remained
afebrile after this one temp spike and completed a 10-day course
of vanc/zosyn. Patient was taken to the OR in order to get a
permanent tunnelled line. Procedure was complicated by 3 degree
av block and was transfer to MICU. In the MICU, after having two
femoral lines and a temporal wire pacer patient spiked [**2198-1-5**].
Because suspition of line associated infection, she was given 1
dose of Vancomycin. 2 days after, patient was transfer to the
floor. She remained having low grade fever and spiked to 101
while on the floor again. Femoral lines were removed. Pacer wire
was being kept until definitive tunneled catheter was placed
given previous complication. Multiple blood culrues and urine
cultures were drawn and all came back negative. Patient received
a second dose of vancomycin on the floor and had a red man
reaction. She developed a rash. Given persistent negative
results for fever source, and rash drug fever was contemplated.
Temporary pacer wire was also removed on [**2197-12-11**]. Patient
fevers decreased and remained afebrile since [**2197-12-12**]. On
[**2197-12-25**],fevers returnedand felt were [**2-22**] to drug fever. All
antibiotics were discontinued with resolution of rash and serum
eosinophilia.Patients Temp. PM heardware removedas well as her
Temp IF HD line on [**2198-1-16**]. Patient remained to have low grade
temps(100.0 max) but all blood, urine, sputum, andtips cultures
remained without growth.
 Dengue fever serologies (from [**12-17**] and [**12-25**]) were still
pending at the time of discharge. Will foloow up in [**Hospital **] clinic on
[**2197-2-12**].
.
2.  Hepatitis: Although AST/ALT were within normal limits at
OSH, they were extremely elevated upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] (to
10,000's, AST peaked at 16,000).  Alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin
were within normal limits while LDH was also elevated to 8000.
Liver was consulted and believed that the rise in ALT/AST was
less consistent with Dengue fever and more consistent with shock
liver [**2-22**] episode of hypotension peri-intubation at OSH (induced
by sedating medications, lasix).  Hepatitis, EBV, CMV serologies
were sent to exclude infectious causes; all serologies were
negative.  Supportive care was given, and liver function
improved to within normal limits.
.
3.  Renal Failure: Creatinine started to rise and urine output
decreased upon transfer.  Urine was examined and had many muddy
brown casts. Urine sodium was high at 110.  This was most likely
consistent with ATN, given episode of hypotension described
above.  Due to anuria, metabolic acidosis and rising creatinine
up to 10, renal made the decision to dialyze.  A temporary
dialysis catheter was placed, and HD was started during anuric
period to manage acid/base status and volume issues.  Pt's urine
output started to increase however she stilled required HD.
Patient was taken for a permanent tunneled HD catheter on
[**2198-1-6**] and procedure was complicated by AV block. Patient was
transfered to the Unit. Patient urine output continue improving
however given pericardial rub on auscultation she still required
hemodialysis.
Temporary catheter was placed on [**2198-1-10**] by IR and removed on
[**2198-1-16**]. She maintained excellent urine output,only requiring
HD to manage a question of uremic rub. Last Dialysis was on
