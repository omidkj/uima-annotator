C diff Colitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
57F with a history of colonic perforation (diverticulitis vs
ischemia) requiring sigmoid/descending colon resection, multiple
washouts, and end transverse colostomy ([**11/2133**]) with course
complicated by sepsis and acute renal failure, admitted
yesterday with right-sided abdominal pain, bloody ostomy output,
and leukocytosis (WBC 17). CT revealed ascending colon and
proximal transverse colon colitis of unclear etiology. Stool
studies returned positive for CDiff, however, there remained
concern for an ischemic component as well. Pt was started
empirically on PO Vancomycin and IV Ciprofloxacin/Flagyl and
resuscitated. Over the course of the day today, pt became
increasingly hypotensive with an increasing leukocytosis (WBC
19) and worsening acute renal failure (Cr 2.4). She is
transferred to the TSICU for further resuscitation and close
monitoring.

C. diff positive

[**2134-3-10**] CTA: 1. Colitis of the ascending and proximal transverse
colons, could be due to infectious vs ischemic vs inflammatory
etiology. Arteries appear patent. Thin linear areas of arterial
enhancment along the bowel in this region appear to  be within
the bowel wall rather than intralumina.
2. Mild small bowel dilatation in the loops of bowel in the
proximity of the parastomal hernia could realte to partial/early
small-bowel obstruction versus ileus.
3. Small amount of perihepatic free fluid. Fluid in the
mesentery adjacent
to region of colitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission patient was brought to the general floor, made NPO
and started on IVF. She initially denied a Foley for urine
output monitoring. On HD 1 she was given gentle resuscitation
due to her heart failure. She did endorse liquid ostomy output
prior to bloody output starting. A C. Diff was sent and came
back positive. On HD 2 she was noted to become hypotensive on
the floor to SBP of 80s. Her WBC count also rose and her urine
output was not adequate after Foley placement. She was therefore
transferred to the unit for appropriate resuscitation.

ICU course:
HD #2-Transferred to TSICU for increasing hypotension,
increasing leukocytosis, and worsening acute renal failure.
Resuscitation continued with LR and albumin boluses, with
improvement in UOP. CXR w/ mild-moderate pulmonary edema; no
free air. Oxygenation supported w/ face mask overnight.

HD #3: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, stopped IVF and
allowed patient to autodiurese, with 2L by UOP. Overall negative
by 200cc. Cr improved and HCT stabilized.

HD#4: Patient noted improvement of abdominal discomfort and
distention, continued management with PO Vanco and IVF with a
decrease in WBC. Creatinine came back to base line, and she had
good urinary output with a return to 4L NC Oxygen requirement.
She had evidence of pulmonary edema, was given 10mg of IV Lasix,
with good response. Patient did well, vital signs stable, good
diuresis. She was transferred to the floor for further
management.

Floor course:
On returning to the floor she was feeling more comfortable, was
started on clear liquid diet for which she tolerated well. Her
oxygen was weaned to room air and her WBC normalized. On HD #5
she was started on full liquids then regular diet, both of which
were tolerated. Her home medications were restarted as well. The
decision was made to continue with a 2 week treatment using both
oral Vancocin and Flagyl given positive c-Diff and also given
previous intraoperative findings with pseudomembranous colon. At
time of discharge she was no longer having any loose bowel
movements.

She was discharged to home with services and will follow up in
Acute Care Surgery clinic in the next couple of weeks for exam
and rectal CT scan. An appointment to follow up with her primary
care provider was also made.
