Allergies:
Percocet / Percodan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, s/p PVI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
attempted pulmonary vein isolation
endarterectomy of the LCF with bovine patch

History of Present Illness:
56 y/o man with PMHx significant for a-fib on dabigatran (s/p
multiple cardioversions, most recently [**2111-11-20**]), CAD s/p
multiple PCI (BMS to LAD, multiple BMS to RCA in [**2100**]; [**2101**] ISRS
of RCA and proximal RCA stent; [**2104**] DES x2 to proximal and
distal RCA), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20% s/p
[**Company **] ICD), PAD, HTN, HLD, OSA presenting after a pulmonary
vein isolation today.
.
The pt was recently hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 19710**]) for
shortness of breath, likley secondary to atrial fibrillation.
The pt underwent a TEE to rule out thrombi in the heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**]
and underwent successful cardioversion on [**2111-11-20**]. He stated his
SOB was improved s/p cardioversion and he was discharged in
stable condition in sinus rhythm and without complaints.
.
Pt was recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2111-12-7**]. Pt was
feeling unwell, and electrocardiogram showed underlying atrial
fibrillation in a fully ventricularly paced rhythm at 60
beats/minute; the right
ventricle is paced from the outflow tract. ICD interrogation
showed a low OptiVol fluid index. Has been back in atrial
fibrillation since [**2111-11-25**]. Over the past 12 months, this has
been his sixth episode of atrial fibrillation starting [**Month (only) 956**],
[**2111**].
.
The patient was scheduled for a pulmonary vein isolation on the
day of admission.  During the procedure, R groin was
appropriately accessed in the vein, L groin was arterially
accessed.  Procedure was terminated and patient was taken away
to the OR for urgent arterial closure. No PVI was performed.  He
underwent endarterectomy of the LCF with bovine patch with a
drain left in place.  Sheath removed by EP fellow.
.
In the CCU, patient arrived intubated on propofol, dopamine 6
mcg/kg/min and neo 0.3 mcg/kg/min from the OR.  He appeared
comfortable with some intermittent episodes of agitation.
Family reports that he has been having increased leg swelling
and dyspnea in the few days preceeding admission.
.
ROS was unable to be obtained because he was intubated and
sedated.

PERTINENT LABS AND STUDIES
CXR [**12-19**] 1. Left transvenous pacer unchanged. A right internal
jugular central line with its tip in the mid SVC unchanged. A
nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and an
endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the
carina.
2. Stable cardiac enlargement with interval improvement in
aeration in the
lungs consistent with resolving pulmonary edema. There is
persistent
retrocardiac opacity and likely layering effusion which may
reflect
compressive atelectasis although pneumonia cannot be entirely
excluded. No
pneumothorax.

[**12-20**] Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with several mildly dilated
loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant. The imaging
appearance would favor
postoperative ileus, but early small bowel obstruction cannot be
excluded.  Prominent amount of gas within a moderately distended
stomach. Followup imaging should be considered. No evidence of
free air.

[**12-22**] ECHO Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the
left atrium. Moderate spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is
seen in the body of the right atrium or the right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. LV systolic function appears depressed. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate spontaneous echo contrast in the left
atrial appendage without organized thrombus. Diffuse and complex
aortic atherosclerosis without mobile components.

[**12-23**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST Subtle changes in the posterior
left parietal lobe in the left MCA territory concerning for
early acute infarction. Urgent neurology consult is recommended.
If MRI is contraindicated and additional imaging is required, CT
perfusion scan may be utilized

CT HEAD/NECK WITH CONTRAST [**12-23**] 1. No acute intracranial
abnormality.
2. Calcified plaques causing severe stenosis at the origin of
the right
internal carotid artery.
3. Calcified and soft plaques at the left common carotid
bifurcation and
proximal left internal carotid artery causing mild narrowing.
4. There is no evidence of high-grade stenosis or occlusion in
arteries of
head.
