Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old female with history of DM2, HTN,
hypercholesterolemia, who is transfered from [**Hospital **] Hospital
after a CTA demonstrated a large pulmonary embolus.  The patient
presented to [**Hospital1 **] on the morning of transfer complaining of
progressive shortness of breath over the last 1.5 weeks.  She
flew here from [**Country 6257**] about 3.5 weeks ago, however it wasn't
until about 1.5 weeks ago that she noted increased shortness of
breath with minor activity, accompanied by a substernal feeling
of tightness without radiation.  Per her son, she has been
relatively immobile as a general rule, and did complain of
increased LLE calf pain over the same time frame.  She denies
any dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, chest pain, or hemoptysis.  No
lightheadedness or syncope.  A CTA at the OSH demonstrated
extensive pulmonary embolus with thrombus in the R main
pulmonary artery and arteries to RUL, RLL, LUL, LLL.  She was
placed on a heparin drip and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management.
.
On arrival to the ED her vitals were 97.6, HR 65, BP 145/75, RR
20, 93% on 5L.  An EKG showed NSR at 66 bpm, TWI in III, AVF,
V2-V6, as well as a Q in III.  An ABG on 5L via NC was
7.42/35/59.
.


Past Medical History:
DM2
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia

Social History:
Denies etoh, drug, or cigarette use.

Family History:
No family hx of clots.  Her father had an MI at 65.  No family
history of cancer.


Physical Exam:
HR 63, 150/88, 20, 94% on 2L via NC.
Gen:  Obese portugese female lying in a stretcher with HOB at 30
degrees, appearing comfortable.
HEENT:  Anicteric, JVP difficult to evaluate.
Cor: RR, normal rate, 2/6 systolic murmur heard across the
precordium.
Lungs:  Rales at L base.
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND.
Extr:  Trace bilateral lower extremity edema, firmness of L calf
relative to R.
Neuro:  Alert, responds to questions from her son.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old female with HTN, DM2, presenting with new large PE
and evidence of RH strain on EKG, though hemodynamically stable,
being admitted to MICU for respiratory monitoring and
consideration of thrombolysis.
.
1) PE:  Precipitating factor likely immobility.  She was
admitted to the MICU because of evidence of RH strain on EKG,
although she was hemodynamically stable.  An echocardiagram was
performed showing that the left atrium is moderately dilated.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size appears normal (limited assessment, poor subcostal views).
Right ventricular systolic function appears normal. There is
abnormal septal motion/septal bounce. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-30**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
main pulmonary artery is dilated. There is no pericardial
effusion.  No thrombolytics were required and her A-a gradient
was at 90. She was transferred to the floors stable, and was
continued on heparin weight based protocol, after
anticoagulation she was started on coumadin and her INR was
followed for therapeutic range on discharge it was 2.7.  She was
weaned off oxygen eventually with oxygen saturation at 97% on
room air, with good saturation while ambulating.

.
2) HTN:  Patient was hypertensive on admission, but currently
antihypertensives were held off given possibility of hemodynamic
worsening. Her pressures normalized to the 130s/70s without
antihypertensives.  Her outpatient lopressor and [**Last Name (un) **] were
restarted on discharge.

3) DM:  Her metformin given condition predisposing to lactic
acidosis, and possibility of further contrast loads.  Her sugars
were well controlled with an insulin sliding scale. She was
restarted on metformin on discharge

4) Hypercholesterolemia:  She was continued on her outpatient
lipitor
.
5) PPx:  On heparin.  No need for protonix, tolerating POs
.
6) Communication:  Son, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 62690**], Work ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 62691**].
.
7) Code:  Presumed full, will discuss further.
.
8) Access:  PIVs.  No need for central access currently.
.
9) Disp: Discharged home with physical therapy. For coumadin
therapy for 6 months, a follow up was arranged to manage her
anticoagulation.
.

Below is information regarding coumadin (warfarin)

What is warfarin?
Warfarin is an anticoagulant. Anti means against, and coagulant
refers to blood clotting. Warfarin counteracts the effect of
vitamin K and helps prevent harmful blood clots. Blood clots can
cause harm by preventing blood flow. Coumadin is a brand name
for warfarin.

Why is it taken?
Some common reasons for needing anticoagulation are:
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; atrial fibrillation
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; heart attack
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; heart valve replacement
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; pulmonary embolism ( blood clot in the lung)
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; stroke
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in the upper or lower
leg or arm)
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; after certain surgeries

How do I take it?
Warfarin is taken in pill form. For warfarin to work properly,
it must be taken exactly as prescribed. In addition, follow
these important instructions when taking your warfarin:

&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; Try to take it about the same time every day.
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; Taking too much or too little warfarin can be harmful.
Find a system so you make sure you take the right dose each day
and do not forget your dose. Some people find using a
pill-keeper or dosing calendar makes it easier to make sure the
right dose is taken every day.
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; If you forget a dose of warfarin, take the dose as soon
as possible on the same day.
&#[**Numeric Identifier 62692**]; If you miss a dose completely, do not take the missed
dose the next day to
