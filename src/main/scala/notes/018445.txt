Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Inubation
2. Placement of central venous access via the right internal

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4509**] is a 59yo M with history of severe COPD and pulmonary
hypertension who was brought in by ambulance for respiratory
distress.  Per report, when EMS arrived all of his inhalers were
empty.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.8 P 121 BP 100/67 R 17 O2 sat
100%.  He was immediately intubated for respiratory distress as
he wasn't able to speak few words.  He was on propofol for
sedation.  His pressures were in the 90s and dipped to the 80s
so R IJ was placed and levophed was started.  CXR showed fluffy
bilateral infiltrates and ABG was significant for hypcarbia to
106.  He received 125mg IV solumedrol, albuterol, magnesium,
levaquin, ceftriaxone and was started on versed/fent drips.

In the ICU, patient is intubated and sedated.

IMAGING STUDIES
CHEST XRAY ADMISSION [**5-6**]
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Sternotomy wires are midline and
intact.
Surgical clips are noted in the midline. The ET tube is above
the thoracic
inlet, approximately 7.5 cm above the expected location of the
carina.
Nasogastric tube is traced best up to the level of the mid
esophagus,
uncle[**Name (NI) 4510**] traced thereafter. A tube-like structure within the
expected region of the stomach may represent the continuation of
the nasogastric tube, however uncertain. Bilateral low lung
volumes are noted with appearance suggestive of pulmonary
fibrosis.
.
CHEST XRAY [**5-9**]
Frontal view of the chest is compared to multiple prior
examinations. Right IJ catheter terminates in superior vena
cava. Remainder of lines and tubes are unchanged. There is
moderate congestive failure, small bilateral pleural effusions
and atelectasis at the right lung base. Heart and mediastinum
are stable.
.
CT SCAN [**5-6**] FINAL REPORT
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse ground glass and nodular opacities with an appearance
most consistent with mycoplasma pneumonia. Extensive mediastinal
and hilar lymphadenopathy, likely reactive. Trace bilateral
pleural effusions.
2. Endotracheal tube ends approximately 1 cm above the carina.
.
CT SCAN WITH AND WIHTOUT CONTRAST [**5-6**]
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Intubation, with retained sinonasal secretions.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
Mr. [**Known lastname 4509**] is a 59yo M with history of severe COPD and pulmonary
hypertension who presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress
requiring intubation. He did well after extubation and was
discharged to pulmonary rehabilitation for further care.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: His respiratory distress was
likely related to extreme hypercarbia due to his underlying
COPD.  His COPD flare was likely due to medication noncompliance
in setting of running out of inhalers.  Chest CT showed diffuse
bronchopulmonary pneumonia concerning for a mycoplasma/atypical
process. He was started levofloxacin and will complete a 7 day
course on the night of discharge. He was started on solumedrol
and then switched to prednisone.  Extubated [**5-9**] without
complication. He was continued on 60mg prednisone on transfer to
the floor.  A slow prednisone taper was initiated on discharge
to pulmonary rehab where additional titration of nebulizer
therapy will be continued and initation of home inhaler regimen
of advair and spiriva will be started.  His Bipap was continued
but at lower settings of 18/16, and his supplemental oxygen was
3L at discharge.  He was encouraged to stop smoking.  He will
have pulmonary follow up after discharge from pulmonary rehab.
.
# Hypotension: He is likely hypertensive at baseline given
lisinopril on med list but recent baseline is unknown.
Hypotension in MICU was possibly related to sedation surrounding
intubation or from decrease in right heart filling pressure with
positive pressure ventilation.  Normal lactate and lack of
leukocytosis are reassuring.  He was started on levophed in the
ED and this was weaned off as fluid boluses given.

# Tongue movement: His abnormal tongue movement in MICU was
concerning for possible fasciculation or seizure activity.  He
does not have a history of seizures and recent events leading to
hospitalization. These events did not continue and no further
work up pursued.
.
# Hypertension with Diastolic Dysfunction: Previously on
lisinopril and lasix - has not refilled Rx in two years.  He was
restarted on lisinopril and aspirin with a lower dose of lasix.
His blood pressure was well controlled and renal function
stable.  His peripheral edema slowly improved.  It is likely
that his lasix will need to be uptitrated in the outpatient
setting.
