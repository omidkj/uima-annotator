Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
gentleman who presented to the hospital on [**2140-9-21**] with
complaint of palpitations, chest heaviness and shortness of
breath.  On presentation in the Emergency Department he was
found to be hypoxic with an oxygen saturation of 80% on room
air.  He had a chest x-ray which showed bilateral
infiltrates, question of pneumonia versus pulmonary edema.
He was treated with pneumonia with Levaquin.  Cardiac enzymes
were sent, returning several hours later showing a CK of 690,
MB of 48, MB index of 7 and a troponin of 47.  He was
heparinized for potential catheterization and subsequently
had worsening hypoxia and hypotension necessitating elective
intubation.  He was started on dopamine and ETT.  He was
subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, peripheral
vascular disease status post right femoral to dorsalis pedis
bypass, and status post appendectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former cigar smoker, no
alcohol.  He is married.  His wife is demented and was
recently placed in a [**Hospital 4820**] nursing care facility.  He
lived at home with VNA assistance.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 81 mg once daily;
lisinopril 20 once daily; Zoloft 50 once daily; glyburide 2.5
once daily; Norvasc 5 once daily; Lopressor 25 b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies..

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On presentation the patient was
afebrile and had a blood pressure of 92/60.  Blood pressure
was 92/60 on 15 of dopamine.  Pulse was 119.  The patient was
on the vent assist control, tidal volume 600, respiratory
rate 16, PEEP of 10, FIO2 of 1, saturating 99%.  Generally he
was a thin elderly gentleman intubated and sedated.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  The patient had thin pink
secretions coming from his endotracheal tube, jugular venous
pressure was 6-7 cm.  Chest:  He had diffuse coarse rhonchi
anteriorly, no wheezing, no crackles.  Cardiovascular:
Tachycardic with distant heart sounds, no appreciable
murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended with
normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities:  The right groin
had a bypass surgical scar.  The patient did not have
palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses
bilaterally, although they were dopplerable.  The patient had
1+ edema bilaterally at the ankles.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count on admission was
12.6 with a differential of 89 neutrophils, no bands.
Hemoglobin was 33%.  Labs:  143/4.2, 108/21, 68/2.3 which is
an increase from 0.9.  The patient's lactate was 4.7 and his
CK was 690, CK MB 48, MBI 7, troponin 47.  Blood cultures
were pending.

Chest x-ray showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates.
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with left bundle
branch.

IMPRESSION:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman with a history
of diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease and
hypertension admitted to the Coronary Care Unit with acute
myocardial infarction, respiratory distress likely secondary
to pneumonia and acute renal failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiovascular:  The patient was found to
have acute myocardial infarction.  He ruled in by enzymes on
[**9-21**] and [**9-22**].  His enzymes were trending down until [**9-23**]
when he was extubated.  The patient failed extubation and
subsequently had a bump in his enzymes again.  The patient
was taken to the catheterization laboratory where his right
coronary artery was stented.  He remained stable, was weaned
off pressors, and was successfully extubated on [**10-4**].  He
did well extubated and was hemodynamically stable until [**10-7**]
at which time he became acutely short of breath and was found
to be in pulmonary edema.  The patient responded to diuresis,
however his enzymes were found to have bumped again.  The
patient ruled in for myocardial infarction by enzymes yet
again and had no changes in his electrocardiogram again.  The
patient subsequently developed cardiogenic shock with anuric
renal failure and at that point was made DNR/DNI by his
family.  The patient was maintained on pressors until [**10-11**]
at which time the family decided to make him comfort care
only.  The patient was started on morphine drip, titrated to
comfort, and had asystolic arrest on the morning of [**2140-10-12**].

Pulmonary:  The patient had bilateral methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia throughout the course of his
stay that was treated with vancomycin.  The patient's
ischemia was thought likely to be secondary to increased
demand on his myocardium secondary to respiratory distress
and increased ortho breathing from his pneumonia.

Renal:  The patient had acute renal failure upon admission
which subsequently resolved with normal urine output.
Following his second bump in enzymes he again had some
increase in his creatinine but maintained good urine output.
Following his third bump of enzymes the patient became
increasingly anuric despite pressors with BUN and creatinine
trending upward and a urine output that dwindled to as low as
100 cc a day.

The patient was noted to be in asystole on the morning of
[**2140-10-12**].  He had been bradycardic and hypotensive throughout
the night on his morphine drip and off pressors.  His family
was with him at the bedside.  His pupils were fixed and
dilated.  There was no pulse, no heart sounds were present
and the patient had no breath sounds bilaterally.  He was
pronounced dead at 10:10 AM on [**2140-10-12**].
