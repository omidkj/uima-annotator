Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 55 year-old gentleman with history of DMI,
pancreas/[**Month/Day/Year **] transplant (failed), ESRD, CAD s/p multiple
stents, CHF (EF 50-55%), Hep B/C who was initially admitted on
[**10-27**] for RLQ pain. Pt reported RLQ pain to be sharp ([**9-9**])and
consistent exacerbated by movement. Pt reports similar pain in
[**2179**] that resulted in colostomy for perforated colon. Pt reports
intermittent episodes of chills since [**10-26**] but denies
F/N/V/BRBPR/diarrhea/constipation. CT negative for obstruction
or appendicitis. Evaluated by transplant team but determine not
to have any surgical issues. While on floor, patient became
bradycardic to 30s, hypotensive to systolic 90s, and developed
chest pain on [**10-28**]. EKG revealed ventricular escape rhythm. EP
was consulted and patient received pacer, placed in right
cephalic vein.
.
# Cardiac
= Rhythm: Patient received pacer [**2182-10-28**]. Unknown etiology of
arrhythmia, most likely secondary to extensive CAD. Pt back on
beta-blocker and amiodorone
= PUMP: EF >60% per ECHO [**7-5**]. Fluid overloaded per CXR and labs
but dry on exam - dealt with via dialysis.
= ISCHEMIA: Patient with chest pain in setting of bradycardia.
Pt found to have elevated 0.20 trop, likely due to [**Month/Year (2) **] failure

.
# RLQ pain - unclear etiology. ruled out for appendicitis,
perforation. pyelonephritis a possibility but no stranding
related to either native or transplant kidneys. in d/w
radiology, not clearly related to constipation as not impressive
amts of stool. symptoms not c/w mesenteric/colonic ischemia and
pt is guiac neg. possible infectious etiology, ? c.diff, but nl
wbc so not high suspicion. Patient with history of abdominal
pain in past- could be hepatic or splenic infarct vs. atypical
chest pain. At this point pt describes that pain has decreased
signficantly and now has a good appetite.
- PRN Dilaudid for pain control
- Check [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim, could be related to adrenal insufficiency

# ESRD s/p [**Last Name (un) **] transplant
- continued on HD, monitor electrolytes
- HD M/W/F , this wk, pt received HD on Tuesday as well
continue renagel/phoslo
- increase phoslo to 3 pills TID, send PTH
- check ionized calcium
- pt found to be hyperkalemic with a potassium of 6 given 15 of
kayexalate and 1 amp of bicarb.

# ? ANEMIA - at goal
- continue epo 10,000
- iron studies TIBC decreased at 216 ,Ferritin levels wnl at
315, TRF decreased at 166.

# s/p transplant
- can stop t-plant meds per transplant team (bactrim,
prednisone)

# DM
- cont lantus and humalog SS
