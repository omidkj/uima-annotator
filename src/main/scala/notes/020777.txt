Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
cc:[**CC Contact Info **]
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left upper bronchial artery embolization
Flexible Bronchoscopy X 4
Left Subclavian central line

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a 55yo gentleman with pulmonary thromboembolic
disease who is on chronic anticoagulation who presents with
hemoptysis in the setting of a supertherapeutic INR to 3.3.
Patient has a h/o massive PE, s/p IVC filter as well as chronic
thrmobotic events.  He has pulmonary htn and RV failure
secondary to the thrombotic events.  He started coughing blood 2
days prior to admission.  He reports that it got worse on day of
admission and was 1/2-1cup full in total.  Of note he also has a
left upper lobe cavitarious lesion, suspcious for aspergilloma
noted on Pet in [**4-24**].

He reported sweats and blurry vision and recent diarrhea.  He
denies pain, chest pain, sob, blood in his stools, change in
urinary habits.
.
In the ED his VS were HR 100s, BP 112/70, 97% on 8LNC. He had a
CTA which showed new ground glass opacities surrounding the
cavitary lesion.  His labs were significant for INR of 3.3.  He
was seen by his primary pulmonologist ([**Doctor Last Name 575**]) and Angio and
consented for possible intervention. He received 4 bags FFP and
sent to the ICU for management.

On admission, impression was for supratherapeutic INR leading to
bleed into cavitary lung lesion.  Patient received a further 2
bags of FFP with improvement in his INR to 2.2.  Hematorcrit was
stable during his stay.  Sarted on voriconazole and ceftazidime
(later stopped ceftaz) for treatment of pneumonia/lung lesion.
Patient was deemed stable for transfer to the floor, w/ plan for
bronchoscopy +/- ablation by pulmonary/angio.

Past Medical History:
b/l PE w/ saddle embolism in [**2113**].  s/p ICU admission and
thrombolysis at that time.  Had IVC filter placed, maintained w/
goal INR [**3-21**] since that time.
Pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary thrombolic disease
RV dysfunction
LUL cavitary lesion -> ? aspergilloma

CTA CHEST ([**2123-8-6**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Chronic calcified pulmonary embolism involving the distal
left main pulmonary artery with filling defects within the upper
lobe and lower lobe segmental branches. Marked enlargement of
the pulmonary arterial tree, likely related to underlying
pulmonary hypertension.
2. Left upper lobe cavitary lesion containing low-attenuation
material with "air cresent" appearance which may indicate
saprophytic colonization, ie. mycetoma ("aspergilloma"). This
may relate to the surrounding patchy ground- glass opacity in
the left upper lobe worrisome for alveolar hemorrhage from a
bronchial arterial source, in this context.
3. Stable left lower lobe pleural-based mass.
4. Stable ground-glass opacities in the right lung, likely
related to altered "mosaic perfusion" from chronic pulmonary
emboli history.
5. Small pericardial effusion. Enlarged right heart, likely
related to chronic PE history.
.
.
PULMONARY ARTERIOGRAM / EMBOLIZATION NOTE
IMPRESSION:
1. Left bronchial arteriogram demonstrates vascular cavitary
lesion in the left upper lobe, with apparent communication of
the left bronchial artery with a branch of the left pulmonary
artery.
2. Successful left bronchial artery embolization with Embosphere
particles until stasis was achieved.
3. The case was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the attending of the
medical team involved in the care of the patient prior to
embolization and a possibility of infarction of a portion of the
lung due to communication with the branch of the pulmonary
artery and proximal partially occlusive chronic thrombus in the
pulmonary artery was also discussed and the decision was made to
go ahead with embolization as the risk of bleeding was very
high.

CARDIAC ECHO ([**2123-8-9**])
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional and global left ventricular wall
motion are normal. (LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
artery is markedly dilated. There is a small to moderate sized
circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence for
hemodynamic compromise. Echocardiographic signs
of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right
sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2123-6-28**], the
pericardial effusion is larger and the estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is much higher. Right venticul cavity
size and free wall motion are similar.
.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2123-8-13**])
COMPARISON: [**2123-8-13**]. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and
the left subclavian central line are unchanged in position.
Cardiomegaly and marked enlargement of pulmonary arteries is
unchanged. There has been no significant interval change in
diffuse patchy consolidations throughout the right hemithorax as
well as patchy consolidations in the left upper lobe which may
represent pulmonary hemorrhage versus pneumonia/aspiration. A
small left pleural effusion is unchanged. There is no
pneumothorax. No other significant interval changes are noted.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in bilateral patchy
consolidation and small left pleural effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:

Patient was admitted to MICU on [**2123-8-6**] for observation due to
concerning history of chronic pulmonary emboli and new onset
hemoptysis. He was observed for two days in the MICU during
which he was stable and did not require any interventions. He
was transfered to the floor on [**2123-8-8**] where he began having
hemoptysis once again and had to be transfered to the MICU for
stabilization. A right mainstem intubation was attempted by
anesthesia in an
