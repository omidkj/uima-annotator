HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
woman who was found down in her boarding house after not
being seen for three days.  She was taken to [**Hospital1 346**] where she had a head CT that showed
bifrontal contusions and left temporal contusion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival her vital signs were
stable.  She was awake, attentive to the examiner.  She had
ecchymosis of her right eye.  Her pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light.  She followed commands.  She had
antigravity strength in all four extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the trauma
surgical intensive care unit where she continued to be
monitored closely for signs of increased ICP.  Her serum
osmolarity on admission was 326, her sodium was 156 therefore
mannitol was held.  Her mental status continued to wax and
wane.  She had periods of lethargy and then periods of being
awake, oriented to self, following commands and had
antigravity strength in her extremities.  She continued to be
monitored in the intensive care unit and on [**2128-4-22**] she had
a change in mental status and became more lethargic and
obtunded.  Despite being given mannitol her mental status did
not improve and she was taken to the operating room for a
left frontotemporal craniotomy for removal of the frontal
contusions.  Intraoperatively there were no complications.

Postoperatively she was again monitored in the trauma
surgical intensive care unit.  She remained intubated.  She
was very slow to wake up.  She opened her eyes, localized in
the upper extremities.  Her pupils were 3 mm down to 2 mm and
she withdrew her lower extremities.  Her mental status slowly
improved over the next several days to the point where she
was able to be extubated on [**2128-4-28**].  She was awake and
attentive.  Pupils were 3 mm down to 2.5 mm, right was
slightly larger than the left.  She localized in the upper
extremities, withdrew her lower extremities and
intermittently followed commands.

On [**2128-4-28**] the patient spiked to 101.5.  She had negative
urine.  Her MRSA screen was negative from a rectal swab.  Her
nasal swab was positive for Staphylococcus coagulase
positive, rare growth.  She continued on levofloxacin for
pneumonia.

On [**2128-4-29**] the patient was transferred to the regular floor.
She was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and
found to require rehabilitation.  She was also seen by the
speech and swallow service.  The patient failed her bedside
swallow examination.  She was given the weekend to improve
neurologically, which she did, and on [**2128-5-3**] she had a
repeat video swallow which she passed.  Her vital signs
remained stable.  She has been afebrile.  She has been out of
bed ambulating with the help of physical therapy.  She is
tolerating a regular diet with thin liquids, and she is ready
for transfer to rehabilitation.

FOLLOW UP:  She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in one month
with a repeat head CT at that time.
