Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute exacerbation of CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- cardiac catheterization [**2179-9-1**]
- central line placement
- [**Month/Day/Year 106792**] placement [**2179-9-10**]


History of Present Illness:
68 year old man with CAD s/p CABG [**2154**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-D1/D3,
SVG-OM3), followed by repeat CABG [**2176**] in setting of MVR for
severe MR (SVG-RCA, SVG-SVG-OM3), CHF with EF 10%, VT s/p
BiV-ICD placement [**2172**], HIT, OSA, HTN, and DM, recently admitted
[**Date range (3) 106793**] and again [**Date range (3) 106794**] with acute on chronic
CHF exacerbation for aggressive diuresis. He presented with
probable acute volume overload, hyperkalemia and azotemia and
was admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] cardiology service. Patient had cardiac
catheterization today ([**2179-9-1**]) for assessment of worsening CHF
with focal wall motion abnormalities on most recent
echocardiogram. He was transferred to the CCU service for
management of CHF and worsening renal function, requiring
continuous [**Last Name (un) **]-venous dialysis (CVVD), not currently on
dialysis.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] yesterday because he has developed
dyspnea and has gained 5 lbs. He otherwise is feeling OK. He was
advised to take 5 mg metolazone and increase his torsemide to
100 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Labs were checked this morning and returned: Na 131,
K 6.2, Cl 95, C02 26, BUN 104, Creatinine 3.4. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] called
Mr. [**Known lastname 106795**] wife with these results and asked that he come into
the hospital, for direct admission to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3. Since leaving home
he has been becoming increasingly breathless. He is happy to be
coming back sooner rather than later, because he really would
like to avoid dialysis (as with the last admission).
.
On night of [**2179-8-30**] he had been waking up every twenty minutes or
so with a jolt that he think originates from his ICD. He is on
monitored telemetry and sent samples last night. He typically
does not become breathless while lying flat, however he
presently feels that his ditended abdomen is preventing him from
breathing well.
.
Immediate relevant past medical history includes two
exacerbations of heart failure with volume overload in [**Month (only) 216**]
this year. During his admission (d/c date [**2179-8-2**]) several
liters were diuresed but this was limited by advancing azotemia
and low blood pressure. Despite diuresis being minimal he claims
to have felt less bloated and less dyspneic.
.
He stated that he was doing well after discharge until
8/17-18/09 when he started gaining weight and suffering
increased dyspnea, both on exertion and at rest. His goal intake
was 1200 mg or less of sodium and fewer calories per day. He
continued to use his BiPAP mask at night. However, he reported
gaining 6 pounds over two days with an increase in abdominal
girth/firmness. His weight was 224 pounds with a dry weight on
discharge [**2179-8-2**] of 216 pounds. He was admitted and he was
estimated as [**10-7**] kg above his dry weight. He was admitted to
the CCU where he was continued on lasix bolus and gtt, along
with milrinone bolus and gtt. He was continued on metolazone 5
mg [**Hospital1 **]. CVVH was started via R femoral line and continued for
several days until it clotted off. Through this time, patient
was continued on low dose neosynephrine as needed to support
blood pressure with goal MAP of 55. When CVVH line clotted off
([**2179-8-17**]), patient was re-initiated on lasix gtt and metolazone
with good UOP of 100-200 cc/hr. Patient was net -15 L fluid
removal on discharge.
.
During that admission, EP was contact[**Name (NI) **] about the possibility of
LV pacing, as patient has severe LV/RV dysynchrony on echo. It
was felt that given his NYHA class IV status as well as prior
use of LV pacing which was not very successful, the risks
outweighed the benefits. However, patient's pacemaker HR was
increased to 90 to improve forward flow. Patient approached new
dry weight of 110kg (came in at 121 kg). His K+ goal was kept
near 5-5.5 with aggressive supplementation. On discharge,
patient told to stop his lasix (160 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and carvedilol (25
mg [**Hospital1 **]). Instead, he will take torsemide (80 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and
metoprolol succinate (50 mg daily in AM). He was also discharged
on potassium supplements 40 meq tid. Patient was informed to
check his weights on a daily basis, nutrition care was discussed
with patient as well. If the patient were to gain weight (i.e.
[**1-26**] lbs), he was to take metolazone 5 mg tablet and call [**Hospital 1902**]
clinic. He had f/u planned with [**Doctor First Name **] on [**2179-9-1**] in [**Hospital 1902**] clinic.

.
Other problems during this last admission included acute renal
failure, hypokalemia, OSA, anxiety, diabetes, hypothyroidism, as
described below in past medical history.
.
He was a direct admit from home and thus not seen in the ED.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
