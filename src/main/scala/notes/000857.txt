CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2144-12-4**] 10:29 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.

ECHO Study Date of [**2144-12-9**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a

trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).

CT NECK W/O CONTRAST (EG: PAROTIDS)  [**2144-12-8**] 10:10 AM
IMPRESSION: 1. Limited examination, with no evidence of abscess
on the current study.

RENAL U.S.  [**2144-12-9**] 6:39 PM
IMPRESSION
1. Prior seen right kidney upper pole lesion clearly identified
on the
current study. This likely represents an artifact due to the
heterogeneous echotexture of the renal cortex.
2. Heterogeneous renal echotexture, likely due to medical renal
disease.
3. Normal arterial and venous waveforms.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Date range (1) 40897**]: The patient was initially admitted to the MICU
service for her altered mental status and potential sepsis. Her
initial labs showed an elevated wbc w/ bandemia,
thrombocytopenia. In addition she had a significant metabolic
acidosis with a lactate of 5.6. She also had elevated Cr,
elevated LFTs, markedly elevated CK 5516. A code sepsis was
called and the pt was treated with ceftriaxone and Vanc for
presumed sepsis of unknown source. U/A, CXR, and head CT wnl. A
discussion regarding the utility/need for a lumbar puncture was
discussed, but as the patient did not have any signs of
meningismus it was not performed. Blood cultures were drawn. On
admission the patient's skin on her legs from knees to feet was
mottled as well as from elbows to fingers bilaterally. Petechia
were noted on both thighs and upper arms. Radial, DP/PT pulses
however were 2+ and palpable bilaterally. Her mental status
briefly improved but then began to wax and wan again. On [**12-6**]
she began complaining of a sore throat. A speculum exam was
performed to r/o a retained tampon and was negative. On [**12-7**]
blood ctx from [**12-4**] came back positive for strep pneumo. ID was
consulted and advised continuation of ceftriaxone and
discontinuation of vanc. The patient's mental status worsened
and she had progressive respiratory distress, odynophagia,
hypoxemia. Her speech was noted to be hoarse (breath w/ harsh
soft noises), but no drooling or stridor. Oral exam revealed
bleeding mucosa, palate fullness, inability to visualize
posterior pharynx, mild tongue angioedema, blood tinged
secretions noted in oral cavity, unable to expectorate. Elective
intubation was performed by anesthesia at the bedside for airway
protection and the patient was started on solumedrol for
probable supraglottitis.

[**12-7**] to [**12-15**]: The patient remained intubated for airway
protection. Since admission the Renal team was following the
patient. Her kidney function continued to worsen with her
creatine peaking at 6.3. She was oliguric throughout her
admission. Renal failure was thought to be secondary to ATN and
possibly post-streptococcal glomerular nephritis. A left IJ HD
line was placed and the patient was started on HD. In addition,
she developed purpura fulminans with full ischemia and necrosis
of her right middle finger and ischemia of her toes. Vascular
surgery was consulted and recommended anticoagulation with
heparin and eventual elective removal of the digit. On [**12-15**]
after HD to remove excess fluid, the patient was taken to the OR
where she was extubated under controlled conditions without
difficulty. The patient also had anemia. Hemolysis labs were
sent and Heme/Onc was consulted. There was no evidence of
hemolysis.

[**12-16**]: The patient passed her speech and swallow eval and was
able to tolerate PO. PT and OT were both consulted regarding
deconditioning and strength exercises for the patient.

[**12-16**] to [**2144-12-23**] by problem:

1. Strep pneumo sepsis:  the patient was transferred to the
Medicine service afte extubation, and continued ceftriaxone to
complete a 14 day course of IV antibiotics in the hospital.
After completing antibiotics, she had no signs or symptoms of
infection for the remainder of her hospital stay.  At d/c, she
is afebrile with no signs of infection.

2. Acute renal failure
