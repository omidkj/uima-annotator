Chief Complaint:
unresponsive at skilled nursing facility

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with history of MS, neurogenic bladder with
suprapubic catheter and multiple drug resistant UTIs, with
recent admission for MRSA PNA, who presented with hypoxia and
unresponsiveness at nursing home requiring ICU admission for
sepsis, now transferred to medical floor. He was recently
admitted from [**10-28**] - [**2132-11-6**] with the same presentation, at
which time he was found to have a LLL infiltrate with sputum
culture growing MRSA. He was treated briefly with positive
pressure ventilation with improvement, and discharged back to
the nursing home with a PICC, to complete a 14 day course of
vancomycin and levofloxacin which would have finished on [**11-20**].
However, the patient was readmitted from [**11-15**] - [**2132-11-17**] when
his PICC line came out. He had the PICC line replaced by IR on
[**11-17**], and was discharged with orders to continue vancomycin
with end date as previously scheduled, as well as a 7 day course
of ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] for reasons that are unclear. Of
note, during this admission his creatinine was noted to be
elevated; urine lytes were not consistent with a pre-renal
etiology, it did not improve with hydration, and a renal
ultrasound was unrevealing. They did not investigate this
further, and discharged him with creatinine 1.5.
.
Per report, the patient was doing alright at the nursing home
until this morning when he was found to have an O2 sat of 86% on
RA, and unresponsive.
.
On arrival to the ED, T 101.8, HR 70s, BP 110/80 but with
occasional drops to the 80s systolic, 96-97% on NRB. He received
2 liters of IVF with eventual urine output, although initally
was anuric. Labs were notable for acute renal failure with
creatinine 2.5, up from 1.5 last week. He was given a dose of
linezolid and zosyn. DNR/DNI status was confirmed.


Past Medical History:
# Recent MRSA pneumonia ([**10/2132**])
# Progressive, relapsing, multiple sclerosis for the last 30
years. The patient is treated with monthly steroids, Solu-Medrol
and Avonex.
# Prostate cancer status post brachytherapy.
# Depression with multiple admissions in the past and history of
overdose of isopropyl alcohol.
# Neurogenic bladder with recurrent urinary tract infections.
The patient has a suprapubic foley.
# History of right elbow bursitis with MRSA.
# Hypertension.
# Chronic lower back pain with cervical and lumbar spinal
stenosis.
# Osteoarthritis.
# Impotence with penile prosthesis.
# Chronic polyps.
# History of peptic ulcer disease with upper GI bleed in the
setting of chronic NSAIDs use.
# History of alcohol abuse with history of generalized tonic
clonic seizures in the setting of alcohol (see neuro note
written in [**2130-3-6**]).
# Pemphigus


Social History:
Lives in [**Location **]. Denies alcohol or tobacco. [**Location **] involved in his
care.


Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 96.9, 80, 132/86, 20, 99% on 2l NC
GENERAL: Obese caucasian male, responds to questions
intermittently
HEENT: Dry mucous membranes.
NECK: Unable to locate JVP.
COR: nl rate, S1S2, no gmr
LUNGS: coarse BS anteriorly
ABDOMEN: obese abdomen, firm, +BS, unable to assess HSM.
PELVIS: Suprapubic catheter in place with surrounding bandage.
EXTR: 1+ non-pitting edema.


Pertinent Results:
PORTABLE AP: Heterogeneous opacification at the left lung base
is largely atelectasis, explaining the elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm. Right lung is low in volume but grossly clear.
Heart is not enlarged. Right PIC catheter tip projects over the
junction of the brachiocephalic veins. No pneumothorax.
.
CT HEAD: Bifrontal periventricular white matter hypodensities
unchanged from before. No hemorrhage.
.
MRI BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST: A moderate to large amount
of foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity involving the deep central,
pericallosal, and periventricular white matter compatible with
multiple sclerosis plaques are essentially stable when compared
to [**2129-9-15**]. Prominence of the sulci and ventricles
compatible cortical atrophy is also unchanged. Post- gadolinium
administration, no areas of abnormal enhancement are identified
to suggest acute demyelination. Within the left frontal region,
a linear area of contrast enhancement is more compatible with a
developmental venous anomaly, rather than an enhancement of a
demyelinating plaque.

Within the region of the medullary pyramids, there is increased
T2-weighted signal, which is not well visualized on the previous
MRI. There is no abnormal enhancement or diffusion-weighted
imaging abnormality in this region. There is no evidence of
abnormal mass, shift of normally midline structures, or edema.

IMPRESSION: Aside from regions within the medullary pyramids of
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, areas of demyelination compatible with
multiple sclerosis are unchanged dating back to [**2129-9-15**]. Thus, this medullary lesion could represent interval
development of an additional area of demyelination. No areas of
abnormal enhancement identified to indicate acute demyelination.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male with MS, neurogenic bladder with suprapubic
catheter and multiple drug resistant UTIs, with recent admission
for MRSA PNA, who presented unresponsive possibly secondary to
infection.
.
# mental status change: had been alert enough to elope from
nursing home during the week prior to this hospitalization but
transferred here because minimally responsive. Head MRI showed
new focus of demyelination in the medulla, other areas of
demyelination essentially unchanged from [**2129**]; it is not clear
if this new medullary demyelination is contributing to current
symtpoms. Likely multifactorial, from hypercarbia, methadone use
in setting of decreasing renal function, and infection in
addition to MS. Improved with BiPAP in ICU, consistent with
combination of hypoxia and hypercarbia. Appreciate sleep
consult; will continue BiPAP 12/8 with back up rate 8 and 2L O2
flow by. Has recovered/woken up to what seems to be baseline
mental status, will continue to monitor. Avoiding all narcotis
and benzodiazepines.
.
# Recurrent PNA: recently treated with full course of vancomycin
for MRSA pneumonia with improvement of infiltrate on CXR.
However, febrile on admission and sputum did grow Proteus and
MRSA, so continuing with ceftriaxone and vancomycin through
[**2132-12-3**] as recommended by ID consult.
.
# Acute renal failure: Improving gradually from Cr 2.5 on
admission to 1.6, with good diuresis after lasix, probably also
autodiuresis.
.
# MS: Continue baclofen and gabapentin. PT/OT for LE
contractures
.
# Neurogenic bladder/autonomic instability?: Autonomic
instability causing labile blood pressures. Continue oxybutinin.

.
# Depression: Continue celexa and duloxetine.
.
# Microcytic Anemia: Cont iron. He does have a history of
esophagitis on EGD in [**2131**]. We have scheduled repeat EGD as
outpatient.
.
# HTN: BP trending up after sepsis resolved. Have added back
metoprolol, titrate up to 50mg tid and resumed home amlodipine
5mg daily.
.
# Decubitus ulcers: Wound care for pressure ulcers
.
# PPX: Continue PPI, SQ heparin, bowel regimen.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed with HCP who is his [**Name (NI) **]. OK with
pressors, mask ventilation if necessary.
