CXR ([**2118-7-3**]):The previously seen density in the right mid lung
is again visualized, but is less opaque. I do not clearly
localize this on the lateral view, but that could be obscured by
the overlying soft tissue of the left upper extremity. There are
bilateral effusions, which appear similar when comparing the
frontal view and basilar atelectasis. Probable scarring at the
right base is again noted. Pulmonary vascular markings,
cardiomegaly and pacemaker hardware/wires are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with history of CAD, CHF, AVR and
unexplained falls presenting with fall found to have Type II
Mobitz degenerating into CHB now with temp pacer wire,
transferred to CCU for further management.  Had permanent
pacemaker placed without complication.

1)CV:a)perfusion: known cad, s/p CABG. No evidence of ischemia
now. Enzymes normal. Continued ASA, statin, imdur and beta
blocker
b)pump: known ef of 30%, appeared euvolemic throughout
admission. Continued beta blocker, but did not add ACE as he has
a h/o hyperkalemia.
c)rhythm: Pt had complete heart block and underwent successful
and uneventful permanent pacemaker placement.
d)AVR: bioprothesis, so no anticoagulation was needed.

2)Asthma/COPD:  Flovent, inhalers were continued.
