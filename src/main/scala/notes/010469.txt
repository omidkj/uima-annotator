History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95459**] is an 88 yo male with severe aortic stenosis who
presents with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure,
including worsening dyspnea on exertion, JVD, lower extremity
edema, and crackles at the bases of his lungs. The patient was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16794**] today, and there was concern for critical AS.
A TTE showed valve area of .6 cm squared. The patient has
experienced worsening dyspnea on exertion for the past two
weeks. He was able to walk from the parking lot to the entrance
of the emergency department without stopping (per his daughter).
He has had some shortness of breath upon lying down but it is
unclear if he has had PND. He has more shortness of breath when
walking on an incline. He has not had chest pain or pressure.
He was admitted for evaluation

CXR [**2130-9-21**]:
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
The cardiac
silhouette is mildly enlarged. The aorta is calcified and
tortuous. There is slight indistinctness and prominence of the
hila which may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement without
overt pulmonary edema. No definite focal consolidation is seen.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Possible mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without
overt
pulmonary edema.
.
[**2130-9-23**] CT Chest
FINDINGS:

Dense aortic valvular calcifications are noted. There is mild
coronary artery calcification noted. The heart is at the upper
limits of normal in size. There is trace pericardial
fluid/thickening.

Aortic measurements are as follows:
Sinus: 3.5 cm.
Sinotubular junction: 2.9 cm.
Proximal aortic arch: 3.5 cm.
Mid aortic arch, just distal to left subclavian artery: 3.1 cm.
Distal aortic arch: 3.2 cm.
Mid descending thoracic aorta: 3.1 cm.
Distal thoracic aorta: 2.7 cm.

Mild atherosclerotic calcified plaque is present within the
aortic arch.

The thyroid gland is unremarkable. There is no axillary,
mediastinal, or
hilar lymphadenopathy. Note is made of calcified mediastinal and
right hilar lymph nodes.

Calcified pleural plaque is noted, particularly on the left.
There is minimal pleural thickening on the right anteriorly
(2:30). At the right base, adjacent to the dome of the right
hemidiaphragm, there are multiple
nodular-appearing densities which, on coronal reformatted
images, represent areas of pleural thickening consistent with
additional pleural plaques. There are no pulmonary nodules.
Linear strand of atelectasis or scar is present in the middle
lobe. Ground-glass nodular opacity in the right lower lobe
(3:34) measures approximately 3 mm and is of uncertain, if any,
clinical significance. The airways are patent.

Visualized portions of the upper abdomen reveal cholecystectomy
clips, a left adrenal 1.4-cm adenoma, a splenule, and bilateral
low-density renal lesions in the mid-to-lower pole on the right
kidney and mid portion of the left kidney. In the right kidney,
the low-density lesion measures 1.2 cm and has Hounsfield units
consistent with simple fluid. On the left, the hypodense lesion
measures 1.5 cm and also has Hounsfield units consistent with
simple fluid.

Degenerative changes are present throughout the thoracic spine.
There are no destructive osseous lesions. Bilateral glenohumeral
degenerative changes are also noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Significantly calcified aortic valve consistent with provided
history of aortic stenosis.
2. Mild dilatation of the ascending aortic arch measuring up to
3.5 cm.
3. Calcified pleural plaques and noncalcified pleural thickening
at the right base.
4. Calcified mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes are
consistent with
sequelae of prior granulomatous disease.
5. Bilateral hypodense renal lesions are stable and likely
represent simple
cysts.
.
TTE [**2130-9-25**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no systolic prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Increased PCWP.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis. Based on [**2124**]
ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is
symptomatic (angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate,
surgical intervention has been shown to improve survival.

Carotid Doppler [**2130-9-25**]
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid
arteries. On the right there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen
in the ICA. On the left there is mild heterogeneous plaque seen
in the ICA.

On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 51/13, 44/16. 62/28,
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic
velocity is 75 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 67 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is .83 These findings are consistent with <40%
stenosis.

On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA
proximal, mid and
distal respectively are 79/34, 89/36, 88/28, cm/sec. CCA peak
systolic
velocity is 88 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 74 cm/sec.
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.0. These findings are consistent with
<40% stenosis.

There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow.
There is antegrade left vertebral artery flow.

Impression: Right ICA <40% stenosis.
Left ICA <40% stenosis.
