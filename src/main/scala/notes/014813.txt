Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
Sub-glottic stenosis, Trachael bronchialmalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2149-6-2**] Ultrasound-guided puncture right superficial femoral
vein. Removal of right subclavian vein and right internal
jugular vein ports. Superior vena cava gram Right inominate
venogram.
Left inominate venogram. Angioplasty of severe vena cava

[**2149-5-30**] Flexible bronchoscopy.
[**2149-5-28**] Redo tracheostomy tube.
[**2149-5-21**] Rigid bronchoscopy using the black Dumon tracheoscope.
Failed attempt to retrieve the Polyflex tracheal stent.
[**2149-5-20**] Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration
of secretions.


History of Present Illness:
40 yo with OSA s/p UPPP in [**2135**] c/b septic shock, mediastinitis,
bowel ischemia (colostomy subsequently taken down) and
tracheostomy.  He developed ARF and later ESRD on HD from
[**2136**]-[**2140**] and required transplent in [**2140**].   Patient was
decannulated and subsequently developed tracheal stenosis.  He
has had at least 2 polyflex stents in his trachea to treat the
stenosis.  He previously required a external button to keep his
stent from migrating.  The button unfortunately had recurrent
cellulitis due to immunosuppressive meds.  He was sent for
evaluation for his SGS and/or TBM.

His history is limited by his inability to recall specific
details regarding his medical history.  He was sent with
incomplete records.

He currently denies SOB/DOE.   He is able to walk 2 flights of
stairs without DOE.  He does not recall whether his breathing
changed after placement of tracheal stent.  According to his
notes, he requires repeat flex bronch for mucus clearance.

Past Medical History:
PMH: OSA, ESRD, osteoporosis, viteligo, TBM, anemia, ITP,
developmental delay

PSH: UPPP, tracheostomy, renal transplant ([**2140**]), tracheal
stent,  colostomy and takedown (for ischemic bowel), multiple
sinus  surgeries, optho procedure, right portacath x2

Renal Ultrasound [**2149-5-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal renal vasculature.
2. No hydronephrosis or focal fluid collection.

Chest CT IMPRESSION:
1.. Somewhat limited evaluation of the SVC given indwelling
catheters.
However, there is indirect evidence for central venous stenosis,
including the presence of multiple chest and mediastinal
collateral vessels.
2. Upper portion of long tracheal stent is lined with secretions
or
granulation tissue. Trachea mildly narrowed at the carina.
3. Multilobar collapse with malacia of the right upper lobe
bronchus and
impacted left lower lobe bronchus.
4. Small pleural effusions.

CXR: [**2149-6-3**] FINDINGS: Tracheostomy cannula remains in place
terminating in trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina.
No pneumothorax has developed. Cardiovascular and mediastinal
structures are unchanged. The same holds for the position of the
previously described left internal jugular approach central
venous line. The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the
lateral pleural sinuses remain free.  The at that time existing
left lower lobe infiltrate-atelectasis obliterating the left
diaphragmatic contour, has markedly improved. The area appears
now aerated and the previously visible spontaneous air
bronchograms have disappeared. No new pulmonary abnormalities
are identified.





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2149-5-20**] for tracheal stent removal.
On [**2149-5-20**] he had a flexible bronchoscopy which showed a Patent
Polyflex tracheal stent with minimal-to-moderate granulation
tissue. Severe tracheo bronchomalacia noted distal to the stent,
with coughing.  On [**2149-5-21
