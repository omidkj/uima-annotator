recurrent stomach cancer

Revisional gastrectomy with near total gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y
reconstruction and feeding jejunostomy.


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 45688**] had gastric cancer (adenocarcinoma stage IIIA) resected
in [**2142-7-16**] with adjuvant radiation. Biopsies of the
anastomotic site in [**2143-11-15**] showed recurrent
adenocarcinoma, confirmed by our pathologist. CT and PET scan
were negative. However, there was concern this might be an
extension from the external growth of the tumor inwards given
the circumstance of excellent margins on the original [**2142**]
specimen. He was given several courses of chemotherapy and a PET
scan was again negative. He has been given his options and
wishes to have surgical treatment.

PMH: gastric adenocarcinoma, asthma, arthritis
PSH: subtotal gastrectomy [**2142**], two shoulder surgeries and
arthroscopy, open meniscus repair, tonsillectomy

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 45688**] was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment.  On [**4-15**] he underwent a revisional
gastrectomy with near total gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y
reconstruction and feeding jejunostomy. (Please see Dr [**Name (NI) 45689**] operative note of [**2144-4-15**] for further details) He was
monitored in the ICU after the operation. He was NPO/IVF with
NGT and dilaudid pca for pain. He was hemodynamically stable. He
has a history of severe delirium on narcotics and after
anesthesia, and he was closely monitored in the ICU until POD2.
He did not have any episodes of delirium and was transferred to
the floor in good condition on POD2

Neuro: He received dilaudid pca with good effect initially and
adequate pain control.  He was transitioned to liquid oxycodone
via the Jtube with standing tylenol and intermittent IV
dilaudid. He complained of back pain, which was bothering him
more than his abdominal pain. By the day of discharge, his pain
was well controlled on liquid roxicet.

CV: He remained stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; vital
signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: He remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital
signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early
ambulation and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout
hospitalization. CXR on POD5 was unremarkable.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. His NGT was kept in place until POD2 and then was dc'd.
He started Bariatric stage I diet on POD3, which he tolerated
well. He was slowly increased to Bariatric stage III when
passing flatus. He was then advanced to Bariatric V POD5. Tube
feeds were advanced as tolerated and we began cycling them on
POD5. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV
fluid was adjusted when necessary. He had a foley for 3 days
post-operatively to monitor urine output. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. He will require
continued J-tube feeds to ensure adequate caloric intake.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. His wound remained
clean, dry, and intact during his hospital course. He had a
brief fever the evening of POD4; UA and CXR were negative and
the fever did not recur.
Endocrine: His blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay;
insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  He was tolerating a Bariatric V diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. He received some discharge teaching and follow-up
instructions but left prior to our nurse completing the task.
See documented progress note from [**4-21**] for further details.
