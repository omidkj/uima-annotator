Brief Hospital Course:
43 year old man with end-stage liver disease admitted with
altered mental status, thought to be [**2-3**] hepatic encephalopathy.
.
# Altered Mental Status: Acute change in mental status per wife.
Ammonia level very elevated and he was noted to have asterixis
when he was not sedated. No clear precipitant was identified.
Given history of multiple previous admissions for
encephalopathy, he was treated with aggressive lactulose and
rifaximin.  He was put on ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylasis.  He
was also worked up for infection, which was negative.  Blood and
urine tox screens were negative for illicit substances.
His mental status progressively worsened.  He became
significantly more obtunded.  On [**10-8**] he developed new seizures,
for which he was empirically treated for viral and bacterial
mengingits.  CT of the head showed diffuse cerebral edema,
thought to be [**2-3**] end stage liver disease.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure- Creatinine worse than prior
admissions at 3.3. Pt appeared to be volume depeleted.  He
received several boluses of fluid challenge, with catution given
affinity of fluids to settle in the abdomen.  His urine output
however continued to worsen.  It was believed that he had a
component of hepatorenal syndrome, for which treatment was
initiated.  He showed some response, which was shortlived.  His
kidney function continued to worsen until he was anururic.  He
developed a significant metabolic acidosis which was treated
with IVF with bicarbonate which which temporized his electrolyte
disturbances.  Dialysis was not initiated as it is not
considered a treatment for hepatorenal syndrome.
.
# Seizures - Seizure activity was thought to be due [**2-3**] to
cerebral edema. However LP was done to rule out infectious
etiology.  LP was negative. Antibiotics were discontinued. He
was started on seizure prophylaxis per neurology, who followed
his course through the remainder of his hospitalization.

# Respiratory: On ventilator for airway protection.  He
continued on mechanical ventilation until he passed away from
distrubances of the cardiac conduction system.
.
# ETOH cirrhosis - GI was consulted for consideration of liver
[**Month/Day (2) **].  Unfortunatley, given h/o of poor nutritional status
with history of inability to gain wait, he was not considered to
be an ideal candidate.  This was solidified after images of his
CT scan which showed defiinitive cerebral edema.  He was
maintained on TPN for nutrition as his bowel was unable to
tolerate sufficient tube feeds.  There were numerous
interdisciplinary meetings to discuss with the family the
prognosis of Mr [**Known lastname **], which was generally poor even prior to
the acute causes leading to his hospitalization.  The decision
to not pursue aggressive measures was made several weeks into
his hospitalization.
.
#Cardiac failure: Pt was noted to develop bradycardia and
conduction abnormalities most likely due to electrolyte
disturbances before his heart stopped beating.  No intervention
was made as pt was DNR/DNI.
