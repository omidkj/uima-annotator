History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 73 yo female with MMP including CRI, DM, HTN, CHF
requiring admissions, and a recent admission for cellulitis who
presents with seven days of diarrhea and found to be
hypotensive, meeting code sepsis criteria. Pt was recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 **] from [**Date range (3) 20690**] with a left lower extremity
cellulitis treated with unasyn transitioned to augmentin as an
outpt. She took the augmentin for 11 days post-discharge with
last being ~[**2172-6-9**]. Pt says that for the last seven days she
has had profuse diarrhea (two days per husband), last today with
3 episodes. No blood or melena noted. She denies any
lightheadedness/ fever/ chills/ nausea/ vomiting or chest pain.
She has had decreased PO intake for many days (could not
quantify).

In the ED, VS on admission were: T: 99.6; HR: 112; BP
88/42-->70/20; RR: 22; O2: 93% RA. An abdominal CT was done
which showed mild diffuse colonic wall thickening without
distention. She was given levaquin 500 mg IV and flagyl 500 mg
IV x 1. She was also started on norepinephrine gtt prior to
transport via ambulance

Imaging:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2172-6-13**] 2:04 PM
IMPRESSION:
Compared with earlier the same day, the right IJ central line
has been retracted. The tip now overlies the SVC/RA junction.
There has been interval progression of left lower lobe collapse
and/or consolidation with interval obscuration of left
hemidiaphragm. A small left and also a small right pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is detected.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2172-6-13**] 5:29 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. There is colonic wall thickening extending along the entire
course of the colon, with associated pericolonic inflammatory
stranding. This appearance is consistent with mild pancolitis,
of inflammatory or infectious etiologies. No pericolonic fluid
collections or free intraperitoneal air or fluid is identified.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

EKG ([**2172-6-13**])
Sinus rhythm; Borderline first degree A-V block; Left bundle
branch block
Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia;
Generalized low QRS voltages
No change from previous

Echo ([**2172-6-15**])
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study. At least moderate (may be severe)
calcific
aortic stenosis. LVH. Normal LVEF. If clincally indicated, a
repeat study with definity contrast may improve spectral doppler
fidelity to assess morte accurately the aortic valve
gradients/area. Compared to the prior report dated [**2170-9-20**], an
aortic valve area change cannot be excluded on the basis of the
current study. LVEF is probably similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 73 yo Ukranian female with MMP who presents with
hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, and with diarrhea.

She initially required pressors (epinephrine).  After more
aggressive IVF use, she was able to be weaned off pressors.
During this time, she was also changed from flagyl to PO
vancomycin (for positive c. diff colitis), given her initial
lack of progress.  During this time, her SBPs were in the 90s,
often dropping to the 70s systolic.  Her initial acute on
chronic renal failure improved over the first few days.  After
this initial improvement, her course began to worsen again.  Her
blood pressures again required pressor support (despite IVF),
her WBC began to increase (with 14% bands) and her blood gas
showed a worsening acidemia.  Her urine culture grew
enterococcus.  Treatment with vanc and flagyl for c. diff and
gent/cefepine for UTI were begun.  Despite this, she required
more pressor support and her respirations became less strong.
She expired at 5:59 pm on [**2172-6-22**].
