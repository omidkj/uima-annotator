History of Present Illness:
73 y/o M w/ CAD s/p 4v-CABG [**2155**] (LIMA--> LAD, SVG--> Diag,
SVG--> R1, SVG--> PDA) s/p PCI to native diag [**2-/2169**], DM2,
severe pulmonary HTN, AF (on coumadin), s/d CHF (LVEF 45-55% per
TTE), AF and tachy-brady syndrome s/p PPM and hx UGIB [**1-24**]
Dieulafoy's lesion on p/w 5 days of worsening SOB, weakness,
dark black pasty stools and epigastric discomfort. He has been
having SOB for the past month and is followed in heart failure
clinic by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**]. During a recent clinic visit, his home
diuretic was changed from lasix 120 [**Hospital1 **] to torsemide 100mg
daily, however he continued to have dyspnea. On [**2169-11-2**] he was
seen by his PCP for hand cellulitis, at which time he was
started on bactrim and his torsemide dose was doubled to 200mg
daily around the same time. Despite the changes in his diuretic
dose his dyspnea continued, which is associated w/
lightheadedness and presyncopal episodes, along with some mild
epigastric discomfort. He believes the dark stools began on
Thursday; he describes them as as black and pasty. He denies red
or maroon stool, blood in the toilet bowl or on the toilet
paper. He has had UGIB in the past but never presented w/ dark
stools. Of note this morning he took his 200mg of torsemide,
200mg of metoprolol succinate, 10mg of lisinopril and
120mg of diltiazem. He also c/o 10-lb weight gain from 222 lbs
to 232 lbs over the past 1.5-2wks.
.
In the ED, he triggered on arrival for hypotension with initial
BP of 88/40 which dropped to 70s SBP, w/ tachycardia to 110s.
Exam was notable for B/L pitting LE edema, guaiac + melanotic
stool. NGT lavage was negative with yellow looking suction. GI
was consulted who recommended transfusion as HCT was 20.5
(baseline ~35-37) and PPI bolus +ggt. Labs were notable for HCT
as above, BUN of 104 Cr 2.9 and INR 3.9. He was given 10mg PO
vitamin K in ED and had CXR which did not show evidence of
volume overload (Although costophrenic angles were cut off in
view). EKG showed AF w/ PVC's.
.
On transfer, VS: 97.4 72 101/57 14 100% 2L NC. In CCU pt is
stable, awake and comfortable w/o c/o SOB or CP. All other ROS
negative except as above.

.
Endoscopy:
Granularity and erythema in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: No source of bleeding identified. Gastritis
noted. No biopsies performed given active bleed.
.
Colonoscopy:
Polyp in the ascending colon (polypectomy)
Polyp in the transverse colon
Polyp in the sigmoid colon
Diverticulosis of the whole colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: Few diverticula noted without active bleeding.
No source of melena identified. 3 polyps noted, small polyp s/p
polypectomy but given bleeding without known source did not
remove polyps. Repeat colonoscopy with polypectomy as outpatient
when patient stabilized is appropriate.
.
Small Bowel Enteroscopy:
Erythema and congestion in the whole stomach compatible with
gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to proximal jejunum
Recommendations: Mild erythema of stomach. No evidence of active
bleeding or pathology found on enteroscopy. Will proceed with
capsule endoscopy.
.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal hemorrhage.

2. Increased bilateral pleural effusions - right moderate and
left small.
3. Left renal cyst.
4. Minimal dependent gallbladder hyperdensity raising question
of layering
sludge.
5. Mild colonic diverticulosis.
6. Endoscopic Capsule in right colon.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o M w/ CAD s/p CABG, s/dCHF (EF 45-55%) HTN, DM2, AF on
Coumadin and hx UGIB p/w SOB, weakness, epigastric discomfort
and melanotic stools w/ Hct 20.5.
.
1. GIB: Initially thought to be UGIB given presentation of
melena and BUN/Cr ratio > 30:1. Pt had anemia with HCT 20.5,
down from baseline 35-36 in [**2169-2-20**]. In ED, NGT Lavage was
negative. EGD did not reveal source of bleed, only gastritis.
Small Bowel Enteroscopy revealed gastritis of stomache.
Colonscopy showed 3 polyps in colon and diverticulosis and 1
small polyp was removed. No clear source of GI bleed was
identified. Pt was given 4 U PRBC for anemia and 2 U FFP for his
elevated INR. HCT improved and stabalized at 26. ASA and
coumadin were initially held. ASA was restarted but coumadin is
held indefinitely. Pt explained the risks of not using coumadin.
Pt encouraged to discuss this issue further with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
follow up outpatient with GI doctor [**First Name (Titles) 4120**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] bleed and
colonic polyps. Pt should get colonoscopy outpatient to remove
remainder of polyps. At time of discharge, hematocrit was 29.5.
.
2. Supratherapeutic INR: INR 3.9 on admission was thought to be
elevated in setting of recent Bactrim use for cellulitis and
decreased PO intake in past few weeks. Patient was given 10 mg
PO vitamin K in ED and 2 units FFP. Coumadin was held in setting
of likely GI bleed. Decision was made not to restart coumadin.
He will discuss this issue outpatient with his PCP.
.
3. CAD/CHF: Initialy held ASA in setting of GI bleed. Resumed
his metoprolol and diltiazem for his atrial fibrillation and his
ACE-I once hematocrit stabilized. Diuretics were re-started
gradually.
.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Patient was admitted with Cr
2.9 and a presumed baseline of close to 1.0. Pre-renal picture
in pt with diuretic use and anemia due to GI blood loss. BUN
elevated from UGIB as ratio BUN/Cr > 30:1. Diuretics and ACE-I
were initially held. Patient was given 4 U PRBC which impro
