Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial flutter for scheduled ablation


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrophysiology study with ablation.
Tunnelled right internal jugular hemodialysis catheter
placement.
Hemodialysis
EGD


History of Present Illness:
70 M with DM, HTN, hyperlipid, DM2, CRF, stroke x 3 s/p R CEA,
SAH s/p LMCA aneurysm clip, CAD, LV dysfxn who had p/w CHF,
atrial flutter and found on TEE 6 weeks ago to have left atrial
appendage thrombus since rate controlled with metoprolol and
anticoagulated with warfarin, now returning for flutter
ablation.
.
The atrial flutter was diagnosed when the patient reported
palpitations to his visiting nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28085**], EKG
documented atrial flutter and TEE documented clot in a left
atrium appendage.
.
The patient was recently hospitalized for TIA and had
non-invasive carotid studies showing 40% stenosis of [**Country **] and
significant plaque in the distal [**Doctor First Name 3098**].  He has reported some
persistent numbness in the thighs, incidentally.
.
He has had primary symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea. He was
started on replacement therapy for iron-deficiency anemia. He
was diuresed with lasix for lower extremity edema and has had
improved symptoms but a rising creatinine, such that on [**2161-3-30**],
his was 5.3 (baseline ~mid-3's). He was instructed to hold his
lasix, permitting his weight to go increase, and then resume
lasix at 60 mg daily. Off lasix3 days later, however, his BP
increased to approx 180/110, HR was about 110 and weight up to
180 lbs by remote monitoring, although he denied SOB or CP. He
did respond well to lasix 60 mg daily with BP down to 170/74, HR
108, improved symptoms with residual bibasilar crackles.
.
On presentation, the patient denies dyspnea or chest pain and
notes that his exercise capacity is limited more by claudication
symptoms in the quadriceps than by DOE.  Denies orthopnea or
PND. Occasional palpitations but no lightheadedness, dizziness,
or vertigo. +Constipation without n/v. +Insomnia only partially
explained per patient by nocturia.  No pruritis, sleep-wake
reversal.

TTE, [**2161-1-22**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(ejection fraction 30-40 percent) with global hypokinesis that
may be somewhat worse in the inferior and posterior walls. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
TEE, [**2161-2-13**]
1. The left atrium is dilated. A definite thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. It seem well organised and has a
small stalk to which it is attached.
2. A patent foramen ovale is present.
3. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV systolic
function appears depressed.
4. There are complex (>4mm and/or mobile) atheroma in the
ascending aorta, aortic arch, and in the descending thoracic
aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION, [**2160-11-3**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Systolic hypertension
4. Successful stenting of the retrograde limb of the PDA via the
SVG to the PDA with two overlapping Drug Eluting Stents.
COMMENTS: 1. Coronary arteriography revealed a right dominant
system
with severe native three vessel disease. The LMCA was diffusely
diseased. The LAD was totally occluded after a small D1 branch.
The
distal vessel filled well via a patent LIMA. The SVG to D2 graft
was not visualized (aortography was performed) and is presumed
to be occluded. The [**Month/Day/Year **] was totally occluded after the first OM,
which was small. A large branching OM2 was well filled by a
patent SVG. The RCA was totally occluded in its mid segment. The
SVG to PDA was widely patent however the retrograde limb of the
PDA had a 90% stenosis and the antegrade limb had a 50%
stenosis.
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed systolic hypertension.
3. Left ventriculography was not
