Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2190-11-21**] he underwent repair of left inguinal hernia with
mesh and 4 liter paracentesis for left inguinal hernia with
large bowel obstruction. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**]. Please see
operative report for details. Postop, he was sent to the SICU
for low  urine output (12cc/d)and  increased creatinine  to 3.1
from baseline of 1.8. He required CVVHD via a temporary line for
two days then lasix and albumin were given for diuresis. Two
units of PRBC were given for a hct of 24. Hct increased to 31
then stablized around 27.  He required  BP pressure support. He
was intubated until pod 2. On [**11-23**] he was febrile to 101.2.
Culture have been negative to date.
A renal u/s was done, but limited, especially for evaluation of
renal vascular flow due to patient's body habitus. The ascites
was at least moderate. The liver echogenicity was normal with no
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The right kidney
measures 10.1 cm and the left kidney 9.6 cm. Right interpolar
renal cyst measured 2.3 cm and corresponded to that seen on CT.
There was no hydronephrosis or renal calculus. The urinary
bladder was not distended.

A TTE was done to evaluate cardiac function. This demonstrated
an EF of 34-40% and moderate regional LV dysfunction, moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with moderate dilatation
and hypokinesis of the RV. There was a mitral valve prosthesis
functioning normally and  mild aortic stenosis. Beta blockers
were started for rate control of chronic afib. Cardiology saw
him and recommended amiodarone for rhythm control with loss of
atrial kick. Aspirin was started per cardiology recommendation.
Coumadin was not resumed as the patient stated that he took
himself off secondary to a bad nose bleed that he was
hospitalized for ~6 weeks prior. He refused to start coumadin.
A TSH was 10 on [**11-30**]. Levoxyl was increased to 0.1mg from
0.05mg.

PT recommended rehab for strengthening, balance and
independence. He required [**Doctor Last Name **] lifting to transfer out of bed.
OT recommended rehab to maximize strength and independence. He
was on fall precautions.

Pain med was given prior to working with PT for complaints of
joint pain in left elbow/ right shoulder and edematous scrotum.

Urine output increased to to 2800cc/day. Creatinine trended back
down to 1.8. BP ranged between 193/84 to 100/55 with heart rates
of 90-low 100s in afib. Mental status was alert with
intermittent periods of confusion with place/time. He was easily
re-oriented.

The plan is for rehab at [**Hospital1 **]. He will follow up
in 1 week.

Duoderm was applied to his sacral area for redness.
