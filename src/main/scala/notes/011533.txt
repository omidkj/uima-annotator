_______________________________________
Radiology:

[**2131-5-30**] CXR AP-Lungs are clear. Heart size is normal and there
is no evidence of appreciable pleural effusion. ET tube and
right subclavian line are in standard placements respectively
and a nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of
view. No pneumothorax.

[**2131-5-31**] CXR AP-
The ET tube tip is 5.4 cm above the carina. The NG tube tip
terminates in the stomach. The right subclavian line tip is in
the mid SVC. Heart size is normal. Lungs are unremarkable. No
sizeable pleural effusion is identified.

[**2131-6-1**] CXR AP-
Interval development of mild lower lobe interstitial pulmonary
edema.
Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on date of exam at
approximately 4:30 p.m.

[**2131-6-2**] CXR AP-IMPRESSION: No CHF or pneumonia. Satisfactory
endotracheal tube tip placement.

[**2131-6-3**]-IMPRESSION: No pneumomediastinum. Support tubes and
lines stable. Lungs clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: 66 yo female with COPD flare s/p intubation;
transferred secondary to concern for tracheomalacia. s/p stent
by interventional pulmonary on [**2131-6-1**].

1. COPD- initially admitted for exacerbation at OSH and was
intubated. She was successfully extubated but reintubated [**5-29**]
due to ?tracheomalacia. Pt was transferred here vented and is
s/p IP stent placement with good resolution of tracheomalacia on
[**6-1**]. She was continued on a steroid taper and nebulizer
treatments. In terms of weaning, she was changed from AC to
pressure support but had a lot of tachypnea, likely secondary to
a large anxiety component. Ativan was too sedating for her. On
HD 5, she was able to be changed to pressure support and was
weaned down. She was successfully extubated on [**2131-6-4**]. She
required BiPAP for a short period of time on [**2131-6-5**] for
increased WOB, but has been stable since then, on [**2-17**] L NC and
comfortable. She had PFTs and a 6 minute walk test with IP prior
to discharge. She remained stable on 2-3L NC (baseline).

2. [**Name (NI) 25933**] pt had several fever spikes during her first few days
of hospitalization. Patient was pancultured, without any obvious
source. CXR did not reveal evidence of PNA. Sputum cultures here
were mixed oropharyngeal flora. The central line was d/cd on HD
#6 when a PICC was placed; tip was sent to culture. It is
possible that the central line (placed [**2131-5-22**]) at OSH was a
potential source. Pt was on vancomycin and levaquin started on
HD 3 for a 10 day course (end [**2131-6-11**]). She had no futher fever
after transfer to the floor.

3. Tachycardia and HTN- EKG showed sinus tachycardia which was
attributed to severe anxiety. She was started on IV metoprolol
q4 hours which was required HD [**2-19**] and then d/cd. Her
tachycardia is also likely [**2-16**] albuterol nebs and dehydration.
IVF were given, which helped her tachycardia to some degree.
Patient was not symptomatic. Her tachycardia has improved since
transfer to the floor, she is baseline in the low 100's (sinus
tach) with occasional bumps to the 120's with anxiety.

4. Anxiety- as above. Ativan was attempted but lead to severe
somnolence. Lexapro was continued.

5. GERD- continued protonix

6. Anemia-baseline Hct is 34. There was evidence of extensive
ecchymosis from lovenox SC on pt's lower abdomen/labial area.
She was guaiac positive though Hct remained stable. PPI was
increased to [**Hospital1 **] and this will need to be addressed as an outpt.

7. Hypokalemia - Pt had mild hypokalemia noted on the day of
discharge. She was repleted with po KCL and lab rechecked. It
should be monitored intermittently while in rehab.

8. FEN- Was on tubefeeds while intubated.

9. PPx- pneumoboots, insulin sliding scale as on iv steroids .
Heparin sc not given [**2-16**] ecchymosis was above. Pneumoboots were
employed.

10. ACCESS- RIJ placed [**5-22**] d/cd [**2131-6-4**] when PICC was placed.
We d/ced A-line on [**6-2**]
