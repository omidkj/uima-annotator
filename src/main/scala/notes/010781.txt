History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 22917**] is a very nice 77-year-old female with a known
history of aortic stenosis, which has been followed by serial
electrocardiograms who was found to have severe left main and
three-vessel disease during a cardiac workup prior to elective
breast surgery.  This workup also revealed a very heavily
calcified ascending aorta.  Given these findings, she was
deferred surgery in [**State 108**] due to her elevated risk. Currently,
she complains of significant fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and
occasional chest pain.  She now presents to me for surgical
evaluation for her aortic valve and her coronary artery disease.
 A cardiac catheterization from [**2129-4-28**] showed a right
dominant system with 80% left main coronary artery stenosis, 90%
stenosed left anterior descending artery, 80% stenosed diagonal
artery, 90% stenosed left circumflex artery,
90% right coronary artery stenosis, and an 80% posterior
descending artery stenosis.  The ejection fraction is 70%.  She
has no mitral regurgitation and her aortic valve area is
calculated at 0.7 cm2.  An echocardiogram from [**2128-8-1**] showed
severe aortic stenosis with an aortic valve area mean of 61
mmHg,
mild aortic insufficiency, trace mitral regurgitation, mild
tricuspid regurgitation, and ejection fraction of 75%.

Past Medical History:
Past medical history is notable for aortic stenosis, coronary
artery disease, hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, and a breast mass
which was recently biopsied and found to be negative for
malignancy, basal cell skin cancer on her back, and breast
cancer
status post her right mastectomy in [**2090**].  Other than the biopsy
and mastectomy, there is no significant surgical history.


Social History:
Currently, she is retired.  She is a nonsmoker.  She
occasionally drinks alcohol.  She has full dentures.  She lives
with her friend in [**Name (NI) 77501**], [**Name (NI) 108**].


Family History:
Her family history is remarkable for a brother who had an MI at
the age 62 with her mother and father both also having coronary
artery disease.

are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae are anicteric
and oropharynx is benign.  Her neck is supple with full range of
motion and no JVD.  Her lungs show mild decrease in breath
sounds
at the left base but otherwise clear.  Her heart shows a regular
rate and rhythm without a IV/VI very loud and harsh systolic
ejection murmur.  Her abdomen is soft, nondistended, and
nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm
and well perfused with 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.  She
has positive varicosities noted on her left thigh and left lower
extremity as well as her right lower extremity.  Neurologic
exam,
she is alert and oriented x3 without any focal deficits.  Pulses
in her femoral are 2+ bilaterally, DP is 1+ bilaterally, PT is
1+
bilaterally,, and radial is 2+ bilaterally.  There is a bruit
versus transmitted murmur heard over both her carotid arteries.

 Chest CT
1. Marked ascending aortic calcification, with less extensive
calcifications in the descending aorta
2.Right apical fibrosis, traction bronchiectasis and volume
loss. Given calcified component and granulomas within the lungs,
sequela of prior granulomatous disease is the most likely
etiology, although prior radiation therapy may also be a
contributing factor.
3. Probable minimal subpleural basilar fibrosis. Differential
diagnosis would include NSIP or early UIP. Recommend correlation
with pulmonary functio4/16/08 .
n tests if warranted clinically. Lung findings could also be
confirmed and further characterized with prone HRCT, if
warranted clinically.
4. Coronary artery calcifications.
5. Findings suggestive of recent intervention within the left
breast. Please correlate with clinical history.

[**2129-5-18**] Vein Mapping
Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral lower extremity
veins. The greater saphenous veins are patent from the groin to
the ankle bilaterally. On the right, vein diameters range from
0.28-0.72. On the left, vein diameters range from 0.24-0.53 cm.

[**2129-5-18**] Carotid Ultrasound
Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.

[**2129-5-18**] CXR
Calcified right apical pleural thickening is better assessed on
CT from earlier today. No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.

[**2129-5-19**] ECHO
Prebypass
1. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum
is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present.
2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on [**2129-5-19**] at 800am.
Post Bypass
1. Patient was being AV paced and subsequently in sinus rhythm.
2. Biventricular s
