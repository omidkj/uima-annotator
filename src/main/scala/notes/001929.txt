Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 25F with IDDM1 c/b chronic pancreatitis and
gastroparesis with chronic g-j tube, depression, and borderline
personality disorder who p/w abdominal pain since the evening
PTA and was found to have DKA, since resolved, and later
developed Klebsiella bacteremia and coagulase negative Staph
Port-A-Cath pocket infection, now s/p Port removal and treatment
with vancomycin/ciprofloxacin.

#IDDM1 c/b DKA: DKA was attributed to medical noncompliance,
though patient reported adherence to insulin regimen as
prescribed. She was started on IVF and insulin gtt and
transitioned to home insulin after AG closed. CXR, UA, and
lipase were normal on admission. She subsequently revealed that
she had been injecting insulin into the deltoid and was
counseled on proper administration, though it was not clear that
she planned on changing her behavior. Home [**Known lastname 8472**] was uptitrated
incrementally from 40 to 80u qhs and later qpm due to
hyperglycemia intermittently to the 400s without AG in the
setting of infection, surreptitious consumption, and insulin
resistance, with simultaneous
