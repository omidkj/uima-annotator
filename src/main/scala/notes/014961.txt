HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60 year old female,
recently diagnosed with transient ischemic attack and
diabetes mellitus type II and increased cholesterol. She
presents with a three day history of left lower extremity
weakness.  She also had left upper extremity weakness and
left sided visual fields.  The patient was visiting
[**State 350**] from [**State **]. She was at home working in her
garden on [**2130-7-21**], when she fell and tripped in the
garden. She felt generally weak later on in her house.  She
sat down and slumped backwards in a chair.  She had trouble,
per her husband, understanding him and what she was saying
was not making sense.  The episode lasted approximately 30
seconds.  The patient was felt to be okay except for
persistent left lower extremity weakness.

She went and saw her primary care physician and was told that
she had transient ischemic attacks and was sent to a
cardiologist who discovered right carotid total occlusion on
[**2130-8-16**].  The patient drove to [**Location (un) 86**] to visit her son on
[**2130-8-17**] and was in a store and again had an episode of her
legs hurting and a headache and then she noticed that her
left arm was weaker.  She also described that she was unable
to see anything on her left side.  She denied bowel problems.
She has an occasional incontinence over the last two months.
She denies recent illnesses, no diplopia, no numbness or
tingling.  She was started on Lipitor and Plavix in [**Month (only) **]
after that episode that occurred in her garden.  She does not
have any treatment for diabetes mellitus.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Transient ischemic attack which was
diagnosed in [**7-18**].  Diabetes mellitus, type II.  Pacemaker
placement for conductive defect that was in [**2127-4-16**].  She
is status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy in [**2087**].  Status post appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  There is a question of a codeine allergy.

MEDICATIONS:
Lipitor 20 mg q. day.
Plavix 75 mg q. day.
Primatene mist one puff several times a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does smoke one to two packs per day
times 35 years.  She does not drink alcohol or use
intravenous drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY: Father is 83 with stroke and diabetes
mellitus.  Siblings are healthy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs 99.1; 120/96; 72; 16; 91%
on room air.  General:  She is no acute distress, appears
comfortable; gaze is to the right.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE
AND THROAT:  No scleral icterus.  Mucous membranes are moist.
Neck is supple.  Positive right carotid bruit.  Chest:
Positive fine rales, bibasilar.  CV:  Regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities had no edema bilaterally.
Neurologic:  Mini mental examination was 30/30. Speech was
fluent.  Repetition and naming were intact.  [**Location (un) **] and
writing are intact.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  3.5 to 2.5 on the right and the
left.  The extraocular movements were full.  She also has
left sided anonymas hemiopia on the left side.  Facial
sensation was intact.  Facial movement was symmetrical.  No
weakness.  Sternocleidomastoids were full strength
bilaterally.  Palate elevates midline and symmetrically.
Tongue protrudes midline without deviation.  Motor was good
bulk and tone throughout.  Right biceps was 4+.  Triceps was
4+.  Deltoids were five.  IP's were 4.  AT was 5.
Gastrocnemius were 5.  Left side was 4+ for the biceps, 4-
for triceps; deltoid was 4+; IP was 4-; AT was 4- and
gastrocnemius was 4.  She had a left pronator drift.
Reflexes were 2+ on the right except for the knee and ankle
and left was 2+ throughout.  Coordination:  Finger to nose
was intact. Positive intention tremor. Sensation was
decreased to vibration and temperature, worse on the left
than on the right.  JPS joint position was somewhat decreased
bilaterally. She has positive Romberg.  Gait was unsteady.
Flow was falling to the left side.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 135; potassium of 3.9; chloride 101.
C02 23; BUN 13; creatinine .8; 253 for blood glucose.  White
count was 12; hematocrit was 43.7; platelets were 284; PT was
12.6; PTT was 24; INR was 1.1.  Head CT showed several
prominent old lacunar infarcts on the right, one by the
internal capsule could be a developing extension.  That is
what was thought.  No prominent ventricles.  Positive
peri-ventricular white matter changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
neurosurgery service.  The patient was started on a heparin
drip and was continued on her aspirin and Plavix. Goal PTT of
50 to 70.  The patient was preopped for an angiogram and was
followed on telemetry.  Chest x-ray was done, showing likely
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and fingersticks were
done for her diabetes mellitus.

On the [**4-20**], the patient was seen by the neurologic
resident who felt, on examination, she had an incongruous
left homonomous hemianopia and a subtle left hemiparesis with
some hemi-anesthesia.  There was also evidence of decreased
cortical sensation on the left.  They felt that it was an
anterior choroidal infarction on the right side.  They
recommended to continue on aspirin p.o. q. day for stroke
prophylaxis, carotid ultrasound, a repeat non contrast head
CT, to start her on Lipitor, to check cholesterol panel.

On the [**4-23**], the patient did have a transesophageal
echocardiogram done which showed the left atrium to be mildly
dilated.  The left ventricular cavity size was normal. The
left ventricular systolic function was normal.  An ejection
fraction of greater than 55% was noted.  The right
ventricular chamber size was normal.  Aortic valve was not
seen.  No aortic regurgitation was seen.  The mitral valve
leaflets were mildly thickened.  There was +1 mitral
regurgitation and no source of embolism was noted.

On the [**4-23**], the patient was brought to the angio
suite where had a cerebral angiogram done.  She was found to
have right internal carotid artery occlusion with left
subclavian steel syndrome.  The patient was brought back to
the surgical floor where she continued on her aspirin, Plavix
and she was scheduled for an angioplasty of her left
subclavian.  Postoperatively, she had no complications.  She
was continued on the heparin drip.  She continued with a left
pronator drift and some left sided weakness.  The findings on
the diagnostic angiogram were a right internal carotid artery
occlusion with minimal artery involvement; right hemisphere
was supplied with collateral from the right vertebral artery
and right PCOM artery and left subclavian stenosis for steel
syndrome, involving the right vertebral artery and in addition
the patient had a left subclavian steal phenomenon because of a
left subclavian artery origin stenosis.

On [**8-28**], the patient did have an angioplasty of her
subclavian artery. There were no postoperative complications.
She was monitored overnight in the Intensive Care Unit where
her blood pressure was kept in the 140 to 160 range.  She
required Nipride to maintain good blood pressure.  The
sheaths were kept in overnight.

On the 15th, the sheaths were removed.  The patient continued
to have a slight left pronator drift and finger to nose
movements were slightly decreased on the left.  Her left IP
was a four out of five.  PTT was five out of five and
gastrocnemius was five out of five. Her groin was intact with
no hematoma, had a good pulse.  She had complained of some
back pain while in Intensive Care Unit.  She was kept
overnight and was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  Her
enzymes were normal.  She was also seen by medicine to have a
consult to assist us with her blood pressure control. They
recommended continuing her on Lopressor, which had been
started the day before and Captopril, increasing in
increments until her blood pressure was in the 140 to 160
range.

The patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on
[**2130-8-30**].  She was seen by physical therapy on the 16th.  It
was noted that he
