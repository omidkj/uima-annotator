HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old male who
had transferred from [**Hospital3 3834**] with prolonged
pneumonia.  The patient was originally admitted to [**Hospital3 28116**] on [**2169-1-8**] for community acquired pneumonia after
patient developed new onset pleuritic chest pain and
shortness of breath while shoveling snow on [**Holiday 1451**].  He
was found to have [**5-12**] blood cultures identified as staph
hominis.  A TE was performed and preliminarily identified a
vegetation on the RV outflow tract.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2169-1-12**].  Events from his previous admission here including
CTA which showed right lower lobe pneumonia and emphysema,
but no evidence of PE.  The TE was reread by Cardiology here
who felt that the vegetation was actually an artifact.  A
repeat TTE here confirmed no vegetations and an ejection
fraction of greater than 55%.  He was found to have one out
of six blood cultures positive for coag negative staph.  He
was also found to have urinary retention and has been with a
Foley catheter since.

He was discharged to [**Hospital6 46972**] on [**2169-1-18**] on a 21
day course of Vancomycin and Levaquin.  The patient's
pulmonary functions subjectively improved until [**2169-1-26**] when
he became short of breath and had spiking fevers to 103.0 F.
He was readmitted to [**Hospital3 3834**] on [**2169-1-28**].  His
hospital course there was significant for new right middle
and left lower lobe pneumonia in addition to previous right
lower lobe.  His Levaquin was stopped and he was started on
Tobramycin and Vancomycin.  He was given Solu-Medrol times
one dose for wheezing.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation.

On admission, the patient denies any cough or sputum
production.  He states that he has shortness of breath only
when off oxygen and it is exacerbated when walking.  He
denies, but has had night sweats and shaking chills.  Over
the last month, he has never had blood sputum and has gained
weight.  No calf pain.  No diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  No
new rash, focal numbness or weakness.  No recent sick
contacts or recent travel.  No history of blood transfusions.
No history of TB.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 96.0 F, blood
pressure 148/65, heart rate 113, respiratory rate 30, O2 sat
93% on four liters plus 40% facemask.  In general the patient
had no labored breathing, although appears to be breathing
comfortably.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Oropharynx
with thrush.  Mucous membranes dry.  Jugular venous pressure
not elevated.  Neck supple.  Anicteric sclerae.  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  Chest:  Decreased breath
sounds bilaterally at the bases, right more than left.
Egophony on the right lower lobe.  Decreased tactile fremitus
on the right.  Bronchial breath sounds in right.  Dullness to
percussion right more than left.  Occasional expiratory
wheezes.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no
murmur, gallop or rub appreciated.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  Left PICC in place, clean,
dry and intact.  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There is 2+
DP and PTs bilaterally.  Neuro:  Alert and oriented times
three, no gross motor or sensory defects.

LABORATORY DATA:  Most recent include white count of 8.7,
hemoglobin 11.2, hematocrit 32.6.  The patient did have a
white count of 17.7, however had subsequently decreased.
Platelets 438.  [**2-4**] urinalysis negative.  Bum 15,
creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 4.6, chloride 97,
bicarbonate 30, ALT 46, AST 33, alkaline phosphatase 109, t
bilirubin 0.3.  Patient also ruled out with CKs of 23, 23 and
21.  Troponin less than 0.3, less than 0.3 and less than 0.3.
The patient's peak liver enzymes were ALT of 110, AST 81, LD
287, alkaline phosphatase 202 that was on admission.  The
enzymes have subsequently decreased.

The patient's hepatitis B antigen and antibody negative,
hepatitis C negative, ANCA negative, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, RS
negative, HIV negative.

VAT biopsy, the tissue had no microorganisms on gram stain
and was no growth for aerobic, anaerobic, acid-fast or fungal
cultures.  Legionella also negative.

Sputum contaminated.  Urine culture with no growth.  Blood
cultures on [**2-3**] with no growth.  Fungal cultures on [**2-2**]
with no growth.  Pleural fluid gram stain no microorganisms.
Fluid culture no growth.  Anaerobic culture no growth.
Acid-fast, none seen.

Last chest x-ray on [**2-14**] shows slight increase in right
lower lobe lung opacity.  This may be due to a pneumonia or
atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.

A pathology of the VAT biopsy on [**2-9**] revealed pleural
biopsy adhesions, chronic inflammation and mesothelial
hyperplasia, no evidence of malignancy.

Right lower lobe wedge biopsy with patchy organizing
pneumonitis with focal prominent scarring, focal interstitial
fibrosis and focal interstitial chronic inflammation.

Pleural fluid taken on [**2169-2-7**], cytology negative for
malignant cells.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially admitted to the
MICU for observation.  The patient was never intubated in the
MICU.  The patient, however had thoracentesis which revealed
the transudate and negative cytology for malignancy.  A high
resolution CT Scan showed emphysema and evidence of
congestive heart failure and right lower lobe consolidation.
Rheumatological work up was negative.

The patient had been diuresed with Lasix p.r.n.  The patient
in the MICU was started on only Ceftazidime.  Other
antibiotics were discontinued.  The patient did not complain
of dyspnea, cough or chest pain.  On [**2169-2-9**], the patient
was taken for a VAT per CT Surgery with results as stated
above.  Pulmonary consulted continued to follow and felt that
the patient had no need for steroids.

A right chest tube was placed on the day of the VAT.  There
was never a pneumothorax and the chest tube was pulled per CT
Surgery on [**2169-2-13**].  The patient did develop some chest pain
a day or two following the surgery and described it as a band
around his chest.  For thoroughness, the patient was ruled
out for a MI.  The chest pain resolved on its on.

From a pulmonary standpoint, the patient continued to improve
throughout the hospitalization.  He was given nebulizer
treatments, Flovent MDI, chest PT, incentive spirometry and
eventually began ambulating.  The patient's O2 requirement on
discharge was four liters nasal cannula.  The patient
Ceftazidime was discontinued on [**2169-2-16**].  The patient will
need follow up with Pulmonology as an outpatient.

2.  URINARY RETENTION:  The patient had a Foley for the
entire MICU stay and once transferred to the floor, the
patient was given a trial without the Foley.  The patient did
not urinate without the Foley and had to be straight cathed.
The Foley was replaced.  A second trial was given on
[**2169-2-15**].  The patient, again, failed the trial without the
Foley and the Foley was replaced.

Urology was consulted.  Urology stated that the patient
