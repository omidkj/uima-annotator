HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on the 3rd for
workup of the orthopnea and edema.  On the [**11-9**], the
patient was evaluated by Cardiology for the congestive heart
failure and desaturations and chest pain concerning for
anginal type symptoms.

Cardiology decided to proceed with a cardiac catheterization
for evaluation of the coronary arteries, and at that time the
patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service.  Prior to the
cardiac catheterization, the patient was DNR/DNI, but that
was reversed with a cardiac catheterization and also Cardiac
Surgery.

On the [**11-12**], had cardiac catheterization with
findings of +3 mitral regurgitation, a left ventricular
ejection fraction of 20%, severe diffuse hypokinesis, and a
coronary angiography with a LMCA 40% stenosis and left
anterior descending artery 70% stenosis proximally and 90%
mid and 70% distally.  A LCX 95% stenosed at the OM-1, and a
RCA 80% stenosed in the mid regions.  After the
catheterization, Cardiac Surgery was asked to evaluate the
patient and it was decided the patient would benefit from a
CABG and mitral valve annuloplasty.

On the 16th, the patient was brought to the operating room
with an initial diagnosis of coronary artery disease and
mitral regurgitation.  The patient had a coronary artery
bypass graft x3 and a mitral valve annuloplasty with a 26 mm
[**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  The anastomoses included a LIMA to the left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the OM,
and a second saphenous vein graft to the right coronary
artery.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, and was
transported to the CSRU in stable condition.

The patient's initial Intensive Care Unit stay was
uncomplicated, and on day two, the patient had her all her

agitation.  The patient was treated with around the clock
Haldol with an acceptable affect.

On postoperative day three, the patient was transferred out
to the floor and continued to do well, but continued with
mental status changes, increased agitation requiring a
sitter.  Later on in the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay, the Haldol
was discontinued.  Ativan was started per recommendations by

administration of both Haldol and Ativan, the patient had
some irregular respirations.  The Haldol was stopped and the
Ativan was decreased with some relief of the irregular
breathing at that time.  The patient's saturation status was
fine with sats greater than 95%.
