History of Present Illness:
HPI:  Pt is a 79 year old man with multiple medical problems CAD
s/p cabg, PVD, Type 2 DM, CRI, who was admitted to Podaitry on
[**10-20**] for evaluation of ulcer/cellulitis transfered to Medicine
on [**10-22**] because of change in Mental status and worsening renal
function in the setting of drop in HCT.  Hospital course was
remarkable for occasional fevers, hypoxia thought to be [**3-4**] CHF,
anemia with guaiac positive stools, delerium, leukocytosis.  Pt
developed sudden onset SOB on [**11-1**] AM; CXR showed bilateral
infiltrates, thought to be most likely bilateral pulm edema w/
underlying PNA. He was given 40 mg IV lasix w/ imp in symptoms.
ABG was 7.46/35/89. Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3. EKG did
not show any changes. Pt was started on Heparin sc. Pulm was
consulted and thought that he could now have bilateral PNA. Pt
already on broad Abx Coverage with levo, zosyn and 1 dose of
vancomycin. Since this initial SOB, he has been desating, and
was recently switched from 4L O2 to 7L on face mask. Pt was
still fluctuating from mid 80s to high 90s at time of transfer,
with rises in respiratory rate also. Pt is also exceptionally
lethargic, and was able to open his eyes for only a few seconds
at a time before falling
back asleep, [**Doctor First Name **] after sternal rub and wet face cloths.
Subsequent ABGs today were 7.46/33/76 and 7.44/35/146.  He was
transferred for observation to the MICU in the afternoon of
[**11-2**].  Urine, blood and sputum cultures are pending at time of
transfer.

CXR [**10-22**]
FINDINGS: The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.
Pulmonary vascular congestion and increased interstitial
opacities consistent with congestive failure, slightly
progressed. Small right pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
Heart size is upper limits of normal.
IMPRESSION: CHF with small right pleural effusion. No focal
consolidation seen.
.
CXR [**10-24**]
There is cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular engorgement
consistent with CHF. There is a focal area of opacity in the
left upper zone, new since the prior study of [**2167-10-22**],
which could represent an area of pneumonia in the left upper
lobe, as the the appearance is atypical for asymmetric leftsided
pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**11-2**]
INDICATION: Low oxygen saturations. Pulmonary edema and
pneumonia. The heart is enlarged. There remains an asymmetrical
bilateral pattern of alveolar opacification, most prominent
centrally in the perihilar regions, left greater than right.
Allowing for positional differences, this is probably not
changed significantly in the interval since the recent chest
radiograph. Left-sided pleural effusion and/or pleural
thickening is also stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment:
79 y/o male with h/o CAD, PVD, type 2 DM CRI admitted for RLE
cellulitis transfered to medicine for MS change, fevers, renal
insuficiency and hypoxia and now transferred to the MICU with
increased O2 requirement in the setting of MS changes.
.
Plan:
1) Hypoxia: Ongoing hypoxemia since admission.  Differential was
originally aspiration PNA in setting of gastroparesis (seen on
CXR) vs. TRALI (less likely due to delayed onset since first
transfusion and slow progression).  [**Doctor Last Name **] with potential
progression to ARDS.  Pt was intubated on day of admission.
Weaning trials failed and his respiratory status remained poor.
No known source of his infiltrative lung disease was found
despite multiple studies for fungal, bacterial sources.  Pt was
followed by ID and all recommended tests and studies were
ordered and followed.  No known source was determined based on
multiple blood, sputum and urine cultures.  Ultimately, due to
gastric distension upon admission evident on CXR, it was thought
that the cause of his respiratory failure was probably
aspiration pneumonitis.
.
2) Gastric distension seen on CXR.  Could be gastroparesis in
setting of DM.  This could be the precipitant of aspiration PNA.
 Could be s/p obstruction as well due to CA or other etiologies.
- NG tube placement on the first 3 days to decompress stomach
yielded improvement per CXR.
- Reglan (renally dosed)was used for motility.  Eventually an NG
was placed for feeding with high residuals that resolved with
time.
.
3) MS Change prior to intubation: etiology could include - med
induced, underlying infection given fever, uremia, or CNS
process less likely given non focal but mild coagulopathy with
increase PTT and trhrombocytopenia
- Patient was alert, in non aparent distress, per PCP at his
normal baseline. CT Scan showed no acute changes.
.
4) Cellulitis/osteo?? R heel
podiatry & vascular following, drain and cleaned the wound.
Wound closed on [**10-30**]. Swab sent for culture. No osteomyelitis.
Did not find involvement of underlying planar fascia or bone.
Underwent wound care for duration of his admission.
.
5) Fevers: could be cellulitis/bacteremia/Pneumonia; no spike in
temo on [**10-30**]. Cont vanco and zosyn.  Zosyn continued until [**11-7**]
and vancomycin was dosed by level for a week.  Occasional fevers
persisted to 101 but no known source was found.  Multiple
cultures from sputum, blood and urine were negative.
.
6) Anemia: Iron: 11 calTIBC: 224  Ferritn: 203  TRF: 172  Likely
anemia of chronic disease - Patient with Guaiac + stools on
presentation, transfused 1 unit and hematocrit check 24.4 from
23.9. Not good response in the setting of epigastrial pain and +
guiaic stools concerning for GI bleeding. GI was Consulted.
Hemolysis labs LDH 182, Hapt 182, Fibrinogen 622, D dimer [**2110**],
FDP 10-40 platelets 130.000, not clear picture of DIC, platelets
low but stable. Persistent guiac positive stools.  Discussed
with GI fellow, they feel that given the pulmonary status of the
patient and since his HCT is stable, he would not be a good
candidate at this point for an EGD given that cedation would be
used during the procedure. Felt that the risk outweights the
benefits at this point.
