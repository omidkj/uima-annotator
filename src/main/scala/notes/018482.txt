prior examination are consistent with aspiration, predominantly
involving the right middle lobe and the right lower lobe, but
also with atelectasis at the left lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo male status post CCY/ileostomy takedown, MRSA/Klebsiella
PNA status post completed treatment with vancomycin/meropenem
returns with development of large left pleural effusion.

* PLEURAL EFFUSIONs:  Patient had on previous admission had
known bilateral pleural effusions, R>L, and had undergone
thoracentesis with removal of 2L of fluid from the right pleural
space consistent with an exudate which was thought at the time
to be secondary to parapneumonic effusion as the patient was
still being treated for MRSA/Klebsiella pneumonia.  Left-sided
pleural effusion was not intervened upon.  During this
admission, patient underwent multiple procedures for removal of
pleural effusions, however was immediately restarted on
vancomycin/meropenem for empiric treatment of the previous
klebsiella/MRSA pneumonia.  Initially, patient underwent bedside
thoracentesis, which was successful, but was only able to remove
~1.3L, secondary to loculation of the effusion.  Serosanguinous
fluid, although consistent with exudative effusion was sterile.
A second attempt made under ultrasound guidance was only able to
obtain 250cc of fluid, and radiologists commented upon
loculations noted in the effusion, and repeat CT chest revealed
continued massive pleural effusion despite initial
thoracentesis.

Thoracic surgery consultants then placed a chest tube, which
drained an additional 1.2 liters, yielding an additional ~2L
after two administrations of intrathoracic tissue plasminogen
activator.  Following placement of the chest tube, patient's
blood pressure, creatinine, and lactic acid improved
dramatically.  However, patient continued to have return of
pleural effusions causing respiratory distress and returned to
OR for two additional chest tubes, complicated again by
hypotension requiring several liters of fluid and several units
of blood.  Patient also underwent pleural biopsy which was
unrevealing for a source of continued effusions.

* LACTIC ACIDOSIS/HYPOTENSION:  At the time of admission,
patient's systolic blood pressure was approximately 100, which
was significantly lower than his baseline, which normally
required anti-hypertensives for control.  While patient was
initially given fluids for and blood to improve perfusion,
patient became acutely hypoxic and short of breath overnight,
concerning for congestive heart failure.  Therefore, patient was
then treated with diuresis and fluid restriction, which in turn
induced hypotension and a rise in lactate, which peaked at 3.0.
Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed left ventricular
hypertrophy, with decreased filling, as well as possible
decreased filling secondary to increased intrathoracic pressure
due to the large left pleural effusion.  Consistent with this,
following placement of chest tube and blood transfusion,
patient's blood pressures improved dramat
