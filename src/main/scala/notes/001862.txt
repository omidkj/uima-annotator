Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2106-4-6**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room and
underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 (left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery
and reverse saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal
artery, diagonal artery and posterior descending artery) with
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **].
Please see operative report for further details. Cross clamp
time:  91 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass time:104 minutes. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU
sedated and intubated for further monitoring. He awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis were initiated. He
continued to progress and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for further
monitoring. On POD# 2 he went into rapid atrial fibrillation and
was administered Amiodarone and Beta-blocker. Anticoagulation
was started after 24 hours of postoperative atrial fibrillation.
His rhythm converted to normal sinus rhythm. Physical therapy
was consulted for evaluation of strength of mobility. He
continued to progress and was cleared for discharge to home on
POD# 5. All follow up appointments were advised.
