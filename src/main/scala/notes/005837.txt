HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old woman with
a history of metastatic cancer admitted to the
................. for right-sided pleural effusion and
pulmonary embolism.

The patient's breast cancer history dates back to [**2181**], when
a lump was felt.  A year later, biopsy revealed cancer.  She
was initially treated with radiation to the right, Cytoxan,
Adriamycin, weekly Taxol, and subsequently Gemcitabine, after
which she had recurrence on these therapies.

More recently, she was started on Navelbine that did not have
response to this either.  She has known right and left
axillary, right supraclavicular, and paratracheal
lymphadenopathy, chest wall, skin and liver metastases.

She had pulmonary nodules on initial CT scan and a pleural
effusion since [**2183-11-16**] which was noted to have
increased on imaging ...................  She has had
significant right shoulder and neck pain.  She was admitted
earlier this month for abdominal pain which improved with
laxatives.

She has had shortness of breath for at least several weeks
but was able to climb a flight of steps and walk a block
without too much difficulty.  She has been feeling otherwise
in her usual state of health with fatigue, shortness of
breath, and some pain, until three days prior when she noted
a cough productive of occasional thin white sputum.

Two days prior, she noted worsening shortness of breath she
went to answer the door.  Yesterday the visiting nurse
started her on two new medications for her cough (question of
Levaquin, and question of Robitussin).

Last night, she went to the bathroom, and her daughter noted
that her breathing was especially labored and brought her
into the Emergency Department.  She has had no chest pain,
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
constipation or diarrhea.  She has had lower extremity
swelling on long trips.  She has been eating satisfactorily
(supplementing with Boost).

phase.  HEENT:  Pupils equal and reactive.  Extraocular

LABORATORY DATA:  On presentation white blood cell count was
8.3, hematocrit 35.3, platelet count 401; INR 1.2;
differential 15 neutrophils, 7 bands, 19 lymphs, 14 monos;
sodium 132, potassium 4.3, chloride 96, bicarb 27, BUN 10,
creatinine 0.5, glucose 111; ALT 24, AST 40, alkaline
phosphatase 127, amylase 34, total bilirubin 0.5, lipase 10,
albumin 3.0.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 140, normal
axis and intervals, no ST changes, R-prime in V1.

Chest x-ray showed marked increase in right pleural effusion,
compressive atelectasis, left side clear.

CT of the chest showed segmental few subsegmental PEs on the
left, large right-sided pleural effusion with mediastinal
shift, some loculation.

CT of the head showed no hemorrhage.

CT of her abdomen from [**2-22**] showed numerous hyperdense
enhancing lesions within the liver which were consistent with
metastases, increase in the size of the right pleural
effusion, and right lower chest subcutaneous mass, no
evidence of diverticulitis, fibroid uterus.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit with right-sided pleural effusion and PE.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient had a right-sided malignant
pleural effusion with a thoracentesis tap of 2 L and
subsequent pneumothorax.  The patient then had a VATS
procedure with pleurodesis on [**3-5**].  Chest tube was
placed with suction and removed on [**2184-3-8**].

The patient also had evidence of PE.  [**Last Name (un) 93280**] showed left
saphenous vein clot leading to Heparin infusion but no
filters.  The patient was started on Coumadin six hours post
removal of her chest tube.

She was continued on her asthma therapy with her inhalers.
She was weaned from her high oxygen requirements of 2 L nasal
cannula.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient has had tachycardia since
[**2184-1-17**] but no electrocardiogram changes.  No decrease
in her heart rate with intravenous fluid hydration.  It was
felt that this was likely due to increased metabolic demand.
The patient continued to be monitored on Telemetry with sinus
tachycardia which was asymptomatic.

3.  Infectious disease:  The patient had an elevated white
blood cell count with unknown etiology.  She spiked a fever
on [**3-5**] prior to her VATS procedure.  Blood, urine and
sputum culture were negative.  Pleural fluid showed
coag-negative staph only and no antibiotic therapy was
instituted.  Follow-up blood cultures have remained negative.

4.  Hematology:  The patient was anemic post VATS and
received 2 U packed red blood cells with appropriate
response.  She was maintained on a Heparin infusion up until
discharge.  She was started on Coumadin post removal of her
chest tube, but this will be discontinued after discharge.

5.  FEN;  The patient had hyponatremia upon admission which
resolved.

6.  GI:  The patient had constipation, and with aggressive
bowel regimen, had a subsequent bowel movement.

7.  Oncology:  A lengthy discussion was held between the
patient, her daughter and her primary oncologist.  Eventually
the decision was made not to proceed with further
chemotherapy or aggressive intervention.  The patient has
changed her code status to DNR/DNI.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Metastatic breast cancer, pulmonary embolism, right
pleural effusion status post VATS.
