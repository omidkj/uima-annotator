Service:  MICU

DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure.
2.  Carcinoma lung.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 22909**] is a 78 year-old man
who was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit on [**2104-2-27**] with
congestive heart failure.  During treatment and evaluation of
this congestive heart failure he was diagnosed to have
nonsmall cell carcinoma of his left upper lobe. He failed to
wean off the ventilator and he was requiring a tracheostomy
and a percutaneous gastrostomy.  He was transferred to the
.................... ICU to facilitate XRT during his
inpatient hospital stay.

During his stay in the ................... ICU the following
events took place:

HOSPITAL COURSE:

Pulmonary - Initially the patient was very wheezy bilaterally
requiring regular metered dose inhaler of Albuterol, Atrovent
and Flovent. He was on pressure support and CPAP requiring
pressure controlled ventilation intermittently when his
wheeze was aggressive.  At first weaning was complicated by
flash pulmonary edema intermittently. He was being treated
with diuretics and Zaroxolyn and eventually he was started on
Furosemide infusion and we managed to achieve gross negative
balance, which facilitated with his weaning.  At the time of
discharge he probably would have been off ventilatory support
for more than 48 to 72 hours. He has a Passy Muir valve with
which he is coping very well and he does require 40% oxygen
via the tracheostomy mask.

Cardiac - Initially the patient was going into flash
pulmonary edema on withdrawing of the CPAP.  His therapy was
escalated to Furosemide infusion and he was transfused three
units of packed red blood cells and his crit was stabilized t
30 to 33. His Captopril dosage was adjusted and his Coreg
dose was also adjusted.  He had one episode of atrial
fibrillation which resolved spontaneously.  He has been in
normal sinus rhythm during most of his hospital stay.

Gastrointestinal - He is on tube feeds at goal via his PEG.
He had some nausea and vomiting initially with commencement
of XRT.  This was treated with ondansetron and Reglan and his
GI issues have resolved. He is absorbing his feeds.  He is
tolerating clear liquids po and gradually his meal is being
advanced to soft puree diet which has yet to be assessed.

Endocrine - He is on NPH insulin and sliding scale regular
insulin and his Thyroxine levels were elevated on initial
admission so his Synthroid medicine dosage was adjusted.  His
TSH level is pending as of today.

Infectious Disease - He has MRSA in his sputum and he is on
Vancomycin for possible MRSA tracheobronchitis.  For access
he has a peripheral IV.

Oncology - His cancer of the lung is being treated by
palliative XRT and he finishes his course on [**2104-4-4**].
After which he can be transferred to rehab.

Prophylaxis - For prophylaxis Mr. [**Known lastname 22909**] receives Heparin 5000
units subcutaneous twice a day and Prevacid 30 milligrams po
q day.

16. Reglan 10 milligrams three times a day.
17. Tube feeds at goal.
18. Epogen 10,000 units on alternate days.
19. Vancomycin 1 gram twice a day. On [**2104-4-2**] which
