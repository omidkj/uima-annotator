Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year old female with long standing history of
aortic stenosis. She was recently admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital
with congestive heart failure. She ruled in for an NSTEMI with
positive troponins. She required aggressive diuresis and was
transfused with multiple packed red blood cells for anemia. She
was also treated with antibiotics for an urinary tract
infection. A most recent echocardiogram on [**2146-5-24**] showed an
aortic valve area of 0.5cm2 with a peak gradient of 69 and mean
of 47mmHg. LVEF was estimated at 55%. There was mild aortic
insufficiency. Due to persistent symptoms of congestive heart
failure, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation
and treatment.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 99.3, BP 156/62, HR 67, RR 22, SAT 97% on room air
General: elderly female in no acute distress
HEENT: oropharynx benign,
Neck: supple, no JVD,
Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, 4/6 systolic ejection murmur
radiating to carotid
Lungs: clear bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nondistended, mild tenderness, normoactive bowel
sounds
Ext: warm, trace edema, no varicosities
Pulses: 1+ distally
Rectal: normal tone, guaiac positive
Neuro: alert and oriented, no focal deficits


Pertinent Results:
[**2146-5-27**] Chest X-ray: There is a focal increased density within
the left lower lobe which is nonspecific and may be related to
focal pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. There are
increased interstitial markings at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.
[**2146-5-30**] Carotid Ultrasound: Less than 40% ICA stenosis
bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 72597**] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and
underwent routine preoperative evaluation for an aortic valve
replacement. Cartoid non invasive studies showed less than 40%
stenoses of the internal carotid arteries. She was seen by the
dental service who cleared her for surgery after clinical and
radiographic examination found no evidence of infection. She was
also seen by the GI service who recommended to lower the
Prednisone dose to 10mg daily, and found no contraindication for
surgery. She eventually underwent cardiac catheterization which
revealed a right dominant system with single vessel coronary
artery disease. The left main, left anterior descending and
circumflex had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenosis. The right coronary artery was a dominant vessel with a
90% ostial lesion. From a cardiac standpoint, she remained
relatively asymptomatic with minimal shortness of breath. During
hospitalization, she had a rise in creatinine(peak 1.8) which
prompted discontinuation of Lasix and Lisinopril. From a GI
standpoint, she continued to experience nausea and vomiting with
poor PO intake.

She was admitted to the vascular surgery service for chronic
mesenteric ischemia.  On [**6-2**], she underwent diagnostic
abdominal aortogram and pelvic arteriogram, selective
catheterization of the celiac and superior mesenteric artery. A
brachial artery puncture with first order catheterization was
used x2 and a stent of the celiac and superior mesenteric artery
was placed.  She experienced post-procedure abd pain and
hypotension and was admitted to the ICU.
On [**6-7**] she was intubated for impending respiratory failure
secondary to fluid overload.  She was extubated for 3 hours and
desaturated and was reintubated.  She was extubated on [**6-8**].
She was started on vancomycin on [**6-8**] for MRSA+ sputum and blood
cultures with a recommendation to remain on vanc for 6 weeks.
Bronchoscopy was done on [**6-9**] which she was electively intubated
for, which showed secretions and no infective process.  She was
again reintubated on [**6-9**] for respiratory distress.  CT on [**6-9**]
showed celiac/SMA stents are widely patent.
[**6-13**] TEE no vegetations, EF >55%, severe AS
[**6-14**]: extubated
[**6-16**]: transferred to VICU, placed on regular diet, doing well
[**6-17**]: transferred to floor, PICC line placed, transferred to
rehab.  ID recommends culture of pts valve during AVR and blood
cultures prior to AVR.  She will be continued on vancomycin IV
for 5 more weeks.
