History of Present Illness:
71 y/o female, with unknown past medical history and no readily
available records, with decreased responsiveness at home,
brought in by EMS. Per discussion with patient's husband,
patient has dementia and is minimally responsive at baseline.
She is cared for at home by husband and home health aide 8 hours
a day, seven days a week. With regard to her baseline functional
status, she does not ambulate, and is occasionally wheeled to a
wheelchair daily. This has been ongoing for years.
.
She had a similar admission for dehydration at [**Location (un) 745**] [**Location (un) 3678**] 6
mo ago (Na 151). She also had a positive U/A. A feeding tube was
suggested, but patient's husband, the health care proxy,
declined. DNR paperwork was considered, but not signed. She was
provided PT/OT/VNA services through [**Hospital 2255**] HealthCare. [**Name2 (NI) **]
diet has since consisted of a liquid diet with some ensure. She
has not been eating much of this per report, for the past week.
.
Patient reportedly saw PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on Wednesday,
and was diagnosed with dehydration. Unclear what treatments were
provided. Reportedly, she was becoming more unresponsive and
tolerating less PO over the past few days. EMS was called this
AM and patient was taken to [**Hospital1 18**]. BP of 80s in field. IO placed
by EMS.
.
Initial ED VS - rectal temp 101.8, 94, 122/93, 24, 94% on 4L NC.
Pupils equal and reactive, but not following commands. Labs
notable for sodium of 182 and lactate 5.1. BUN and Cr at 66 and
2.1, respectively, without a baseline.
.
Imaging showed normal head CT (No ICH, no fracture, no large
territorial infarct, no mass effect). EKG showed lateral
depressions V3-V6, and a troponin was added on. Patient was
given rectal aspirin, tylenol, vancomycin and zosyn. She
received 2L IVF prior to transfer. CXR showing no acute process.
UOP was noted to be minimal despite IVF. Foley placed. Bcx
pending.
.
She was felt to be protecting her airway, and was not intubated.
GCS estimated at 9. Access - IO and 20G piv.

CT Head:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, mass, shift of the
usually
midline structures or large territorial infarction. There is
massive
ventriculomegaly of uncertain etiology. Recommend correlation
with clinical symptoms and correlation with prior studies when
available. Enlargement of the sulci is also noted, suggestive of
some degree of cortical atrophy. However, it is uncertain if the
degree of ventriculomegaly can alone be explained by involution.
Periventricular hypoattenuation suggests small vessel ischemic
disease. There is no skull fracture or scalp hematoma. The
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe ventriculomegaly of uncertain chronicity or etiology.
Recommend
correlation with prior imaging and clinical symptoms as normal
pressure
hydrocephalus is not excluded.  2. No intracranial hemorrhage.
.
ANKLE (AP, MORTISE & LAT) LEFT [**2191-4-19**]
No marker to indicate location of concern for osteomyelitis,
though skin ulceration is suggested overlying lateral malleolus.
On single view of this area, a focal area of cortical erosion at
the lateral malleolus
may represent osteomyelitis. If concern for osteomyelitis, could
evaluate
with an MRI.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2191-4-18**]
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process
.
CHEST XRAY [**2191-4-20**]
IMPRESSION
1. Left lower lobe collapse.
2. Heterogeneous opacities in the mid left lung could be
atelectasis or
pneumonia.
3. Possible small left pleural effusion.
.
CHEST XRAY [**2191-4-22**]
IMPRESSION
1. Equivocally increased left mid and new right upper lung
opacities are most consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
2. Unchanged left lower lobe collapse.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a 71 year old lady with end stage dementia with limited
interaction who was admitted for management of hypernatremia and
acute renal failure. Acute renal failure and electrolyte
abnormalities resolved with intravenous hydration.  She had a
PEG tube placed for nutrition and code status revision to DNR/I.
Palliative care and social work were consulted to assist family
with goals of care discussion - she was discharged to hospice.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Goals of Care: Goals of care discussion initiated in the ICU
and continued on transfer to the medical floor.  Husband
initially did not feel he was 'ready to let go' and as health
care proxy opted to have a PEG tube placed. Social work and
Palliative care were consulted to assist husband and family
discuss goals of care and introduction of hospice. The husbands
own geriatrician contact[**Name (NI) **] [**Hospital1 18**] social work and the patient
himself regarding hospice care.  The patient's husband, was
accepting of more care at home and preferred that his wife
return home rather than remain institutionalized.
.
# Hypernatremia: Patient initially admitted to the MICU due to
sodium of 182 for close monitoring. This was felt to be
secondary to severe dehydration as patient not eating at home.
Her free water deficit estimated to be over 8 L.  She was
started on NS @ 125 and D5W @ 70 and in the first 15 hours.  Her
fluids were then changed to NS @ 125 alone and her repeat sodium
was 163 so fluids were continued.  Her serum sodium corrected to
147.  IV hydration was discontinued and remaining 2 L free water
deficit was corrected with PEG tube free water flushes and tube
feeds.  Sodium remained stable throughout hospital stay with
nutritional support. Urine output was initially poor but
improved with initial hydration.
.
# Encephalopathy: At baseline (for >5 years) the patient is
bedbound, minimally responsive, does not speak or follow
commands.  Per family her mental status was somewhat worse prior
to admission, but back to baseline once she arrived to the ICU.
She received one dose of Vanco/Zosyn in the ED. CT head was
negative for acute change (showed ventriculomegaly) and this
change was felt most likely due to hypernatremia.  Infectious
etiologies felt less likely and antibiotics not continued. U/A
negative, blood cultures sent and were negative.
.
# Left lateral malleolus ulcer: Heel ulcer with positive bone
