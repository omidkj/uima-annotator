UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is normal,
decreased from prior.
The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged, with widening
of the
superior mediastinum compatible with mediastinal lipomatosis.
Reticular
opacities within both upper lobes appear improved from the
prior, compatible
with patient's history of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. No
new areas of
focal consolidation are seen. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
identified. Several old right-sided healed rib fractures are
again noted.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in reticular opacities within
both upper
lobes compatible with patient's history of cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia.
No new areas of focal consolidation seen.

Renal US:
FINDINGS: No hydronephrosis, stones, or masses are seen
bilaterally. The
right kidney measures 11.8 cm and the left kidney measures 10.9
cm.

IMPRESSION: Normal renal son
