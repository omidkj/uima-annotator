Vomiting

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old man with AIDS (CD4 126 on [**12/2157**]),
type II diabetes mellitus, and an invasive squamous cell
carcinoma of the anorectal canal (s/p chemo-radiation therapy
and extensive surgery [**11-12**]) with chief complaint of vomiting
over the last month. He says that, for about the last month, he
has been vomiting now daily. He denies any blood or coffee
grounds in his vomtius. He vomits food or gastric contents. He
has stopped eating solid foods due to fear of vomiting. He
vomits up any food that he has eaten, even up to 6 hours prior,
but has been able to keep liquids and his medications down.

His colostomy is working well, although he has noted an increase
in bowel movements despite cutting back on his diet. He has no
blood in the stools, and no black stools.  Stools are liquidy
brown and "cocoa -colored."

He has had intermittent right lower quadrant "crampy" pain, but
is not sure of the association of this with the vomiting or
bowel movements. He has had no fevers, and denies night sweats.
He says he has been taking all of his medications on time and as
directed, and has not been eating outside of his home or had any
unusual or poorly cooked meals.

His partner notes that he is becoming weaker, and has to rest
after walking only a few feet because he's "tired." He denies
any shortness of breath. At the time of his prior office visit
in  [**12/2157**], he was going for daily walks w/o problems. His
partner  also thinks that Mr. [**Known lastname **] also seems to be confused:
Forgetting  things/elements of conversations, and not following

conversations.

Past Medical History:
1. AIDS: He was found to be HIV positive in [**2144**]; his (only)
risk  factor is (homo-)sexual exposure(s). He has a
multi-resistant  virus, due to serial monotherapy in the early
[**2142**]'s and some  adherence problems thereafter. [**Name2 (NI) **] is currently
on a regimen of  atazanavir 300 mg/day boosted by ritonavir 100
mg/day,  emtrictabine 200 mg/day, tenofovir 300 mg/day, and
zidovudine 300  mg po bid. His last CD4 count in [**12/2157**] was 126,
with a  corresponding viral load that was undetectable.
.
2. Invasive Squamous Cell carcinoma of the Anorectal Canal: In
early [**4-/2157**] had BRBPR. Colonscopy [**2157-5-10**] showed 8 mm sessile
polyp in the sigmoid colon,and a fugating 3.5 cm mass just above
the anal verge. The biopsies of both lesions revealed focally
invasive squamous cell  carcinoma. He had a complicated course
since the tumor was necrotic,  infected, and obstructing the
rectal canal. He needed a diverting  colonoscopy to be placed,
and had two admissions for fevers due  to infection of the
tumor. In [**6-12**], he started radiation therapy  with chemotherapy
for augmentation (5- fluorouracil and cisplatin).In early
[**11/2157**], he had an antrior/posterior resection of the primary
tumor. Pathology of the tissue removed revealed foci of
active tumor.
.
3. DM2: Diagnosed in [**2153**]. This was initially treated with
dietary  intervention. He had been on a regimen of Actos and
glyburide,  but has had medications withdrawn since marked
weight loss during  the chemo-radiation therapy. His last
glycated hemoglobin in [**12-14**]  was 4.5%.
.
4. Remote EtOH abuse:He has a history of ethanol abuse, but this
has been inremission for over 10 years.
.
5. Lung Nodule: He has a calcified pulmonary nodule on a chest X
ray in 11/93.His sister had tuberculosis, but he had minimal
exposure to her.
.
6. Syphilis: He has a history of syphilis in the late [**2132**]'s and
does not recall what therapy he received.
.
7. cystic parotiditis [**2152**]
.
8. Normal ETT MIBI: In [**9-/2154**], he had a CT Scan of his heart
(as part of a study)that revealed extensive calcifications of
his coronary arteries.He, therefore, had an exercise thallium
study that revealed an EF of 62% and no perfusion defects at a
111% predicted heart rate.
.
9. Hyperlipidemia:Was on statins before losing weight.
.
10. COPD: "COPD" by CT scan in [**2154**]. Initial CT scan showed
ground glass opacities. Seen by pulmonolgy at [**Hospital1 18**] and repeat
CT scan was normal.
.
Past Surgical History:
1. He had some cosmetic surgery at the age of 18 to correct a
scar on his head sustained in some childhood head trauma.
2. He had an appendectomy at the age of 45.

Social History:
Social History: He was in the Air Force, and then got a college
education.After that, he moved to [**State 531**] and worked as an
interior
designer for several decades, and retired to [**Location 3615**], Mass.

He has traveled to Europe, the Middle East, the SW USA, and
[**State 108**]. He lives with his partner. [**Name (NI) **] has several dogs at home.

Tobacoo: None x 12 years, but previous 40 pack year history;
EtOH: Prior alcoholism, but none for 12 years; Illicit Drugs:
None.

Family History: Mother who died at  the age of 94. His father
died at the age of 101.  He has 1 sister who had tuberculosis,
and 2 sisters died of
breast cancer. He has one brother who has had a melanoma, and
one

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 73 yo male with AIDS, DM2, invasive carcinoma of the
anorectal canal s/p resection and diverting colostomy [**11-12**]
presented with vomiting and and intermittent RLQ pain. He was
diagnosed with a partial small bowel obstruction until [**2-27**],
when his symptoms failed to resolve and a CT scan showed a
transition point. He was taken to the operating room and
underwent extensive lysis of adhesions and a biopsy of a small
bowel mass. The operation was made much more challenging by the
existence of radiation changes in his pelvis after treatment for
anal cancer. His recovery was arduous, and bowel function was
slow to recover. He was started on TPN. On [**3-30**], he developed
gross hematuria, and a Urology consult recommended a cystoscopy.
As a follow-up surgery was planned for [**4-5**], the cystoscopy was
done at this time. His surgery on [**4-5**] consisted of an ex lap
and construction of an ileocolic bypass. Cystopscopy revealed
only small clot and expected inflammatory changes.

Unsurprisingly, his bowel function was again slow to return. He
continued TPN, and continued to have high NGT outputs. Although
his ostomy output continued to be negligible, the tissue itself
was viable, and there was no indication of frank obstruction. A
repeat small-bowel follow through on [**4-18**] was negative for
obstruction, and in fact the contrast could be seen freely
passing from the ostomy site. On [**4-19**], his urine again darkened
and became quite cloudy. He was fluid resuscitated and his urine
color and output improved. Initially the cloudine
