Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for cardiogenic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Inta Aortic Balloon Pump Placement


History of Present Illness:
49 y/o F w/ prior CABG (SVG to the OM, SVG to PDA/LPL, SVG to
Diag/LAD), multiple peripheral interventions, prior VF arrest
and ICD placement, who is transferred from an OSH for
cardiogenic shock.
.
Patient initially presented on [**2140-4-24**] with chest pain.  She
reported that she developed increasing episodes of chest
discomfort with walking in the 1-2 weeks prior to presenation.
On the night prior to presentation, she developed chest
discomfort at 9pm.  She felt this to be GERD and so went to
sleep, but woke up all night with chest pain.  She described the
pain as radiating to her right shoulder and right arm (but not
left arm).  She took some out of date nitro she had available
w/o improvement.  The following morning she attempted to get a
new nitro prescription at the pharmacy which rapidly helped her
pain improve, but it quickly returned and was never completely
pain free.  She presented to the ED approximately 12 hours after
the onset of her pain the night before.
.
In the OSH ED she was reported to have ST elevation in V2 2mm
and ST elevation in V1/V3.  Bedside Echo demonstrated
hypokinetic/akinetic mid-distal anterior septum, basal and
distal anterior wall, and entire apex.  EF 35% (previous EF in
[**2138**] - 60%).  Patient was started on metoprolol, integrilin,
nitroglycerin, and heparin gtt and was never chest pain free.
Patient was transfered to [**Hospital3 17921**] Center for emergent
catheterization.
.
On arrival at [**Hospital3 17921**] Center, patient was cath'd but no
intervention was performed(report not available - images not yet
reviewed).  On cath found VG to OM with stent, unchanged from
previous, VG to PDA patent with collaterals to distal LAD, VG to
LAD occluded with proximal thrombus (previously patent in [**2138**]).
 Patient was managed medically.
.
After presentation patient was on the medical floor, and
developed what was reportedly completed heart block and
cardiogenic shock.  Repeat Echo showed extension of her infarct
with EF 20-25%, and new RV dysfunction.  She was intubated,
started on dopamine and placed on IABP.  She was taken back to
the lab where gain no intervenable lesion was identified (report
unavailable - images not yet reviewed).  No apparent change on
cath but will need to review images.  She was then taken back to
the ICU on pressors.  Over next 2-3 days where she was weaned of
pressors but could not be weaned off dopamine and IABP.  She was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for mgmt.
.
ICU course was otherwise notable for poor LE pulses with
intermittent loss of pulses.  Patient was treated for strep
pneumonia with ceftriaxone (unclear how many days of therapy).

CXR [**2140-5-2**]
There is interval slight progression of the opacification of
both lung bases that might be consistent with aspiration versus
the underdevelopment of infectious process. Bilateral pleural
effusions are most likely present, small-to-moderate. No
evidence of overt pulmonary edema is seen. The patient is in
mild interstitial engorgement. The right subclavian line tip is
in mid SVC. No pneumothorax is present. Bilateral stents in the
most likely subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries are present.

.
ECG:
Sinus rhythm
ST segment elevation in leads V1-V4 with poor R wave progression
- suggest
anterior myocardial infarction - possibly acute
Lateral ST-T changes are nonspecific
Since previous tracing of [**2140-4-30**], faster rate present
.
Rest thallium [**2140-5-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
Severe fixed perfusion defects in the distal anterior, and
apical walls and a moderate defect of the septum, with no
evidence of redistribution on the 4 and 24 hr scans to suggest
an area of hibernating myocardium.
.
ECHO [**2140-4-30**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function is depressed (ejection fraction
40-50 percent) secondary to extensive severe apical akinesis
with focal dyskinesis. The anterior septum and anterior free
wall are severely hypokinetic/akinetic. The rest of the left
ventricle is hyperdynamic. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. However, due to extensive
acoustic artifact from the right heart wire/catheter, the amount
of tricuspid regurgitation may be inaccurately quantitated by
color-flow imaging. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2138-6-23**], extensive left
ventricular contractile dysfunction now present. A wire/catheter
is seen crossing the tricuspid valve, and there is now
significant tricuspid regurgitation, possibly related to the
wire/catheter.
