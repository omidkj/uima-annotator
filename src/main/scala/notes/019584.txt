History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname 2894**] [**Known lastname 2895**] is a very nice 62 year-old woman with
significant past medical history of diabtes mellitus type 2,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p CABG who comes with three
weeks of shortness of breath and dyspnea on excertion. Patient
states that she is not very active at home given baseline
shortness of breath, which is thought to be secondarely to her
heart disease and COPD/Asthma, but she is able to do 1 flight of
stairs with difficulty. However, during the last 3 weeks she has
noted progressive SOB with less activity such as 10 steps. She
denies any nausea, vomit, cough, chest pain, palpitations,
wheezing associated with the SOB. She still uses either 1 or no
pillows at night and can lie flat without difficulty. She
weights herself daily and has been with diet to try to lose
wieght. There have been no sick contacts and she denies any
fever, chills, rigors, cough, rhinorrhea, arthralgias, muscle
pains, diarrhea, dysuria, urinary frequency. She went to see her
endocrinologist that follows her for her diabetes mellitus and
was asked to come to our emergency room. Her VS at that time
were: BP 167/71 mmHg, P 72 BPM, SpO2 O2 93% oN RA.
.
Per patient's report she had a stress test done in [**Month (only) **] last
year, but could not walk for more than a couple of minutes.
There was no imaging done. She had not had a cardiac cath since
her CABG.
.
In the ER her initial VS were BP 163/61 mmHg, P63 BPM, RR 17,
94% on RA, T 98.4 F. She had an ECG that showed occasional PVCs
with LVH by Sokolow-[**Doctor Last Name **] cirteria with TWI in I, II avL and
V5-V6 as well as <1mm ST depression in I, II and V5-V6 without
any dynamic changes. Patient was admitted for ROMI.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Echo: [**2148-1-4**]
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal
and mid-inferior walls, as well as basal inferoseptal and
inferolateral segments (dominant RCA or LCx territory). The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.
.
[**2148-1-3**]- cardiac perfusion
IMPRESSION:
1. Fixed, medium sized, moderate reduction in photon counts
involving the PDA territory.
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size. Hypokinesis of the mid
and basal
inferior wall and the basal inferoseptum with preserved systolic
function.
.
[**2148-1-3**] - stress
This is a 62 year old IDDM woman s/p CABG, htn, COPD
who was referred for exercise stress with nuclear imaging
following
serial negative cardiac enzymes to evaluate symptoms of dyspnea
on
exertion. The patient completed 6.75 minutes of a modified [**Doctor First Name **]
protocol and reached a peak MET capacity of 4.8 which represents
a fair
functional capacity for her age. The test was terminated due to
fatigue. There were no complaints of chest, neck, back, or arm
pain.
Compared to baseline ECG with prominent voltage consistent with
LVH and
associated repolarization changes, there were no significant ST
segment
changes appreciated. The rhythm was sinus throughout the study
with
multifocal PVCs and two ventricular couplets. Blood pressure
response to
exercise was appropriat
