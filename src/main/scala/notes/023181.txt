Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
77-year-old female with PMH of reported COPD (not confirmed by
prior PFTs), incisinal hernia following an ileostomy and
reversal, and treatment for an abdominal abscess, chronic
leukocytosis, chronic abnormal chest CT with mild bronchiectasis
and some right middle lobe opacities, presents with gradually
worsening shortness of breath over the past 3-5 months, worse on
exertion, and instructed by her PCP to present to the ED today.
Over the past few days she has become increasingly dyspneic
simply walking around her house.  She has been taking combivent
qid and 2 puffs flovent [**Hospital1 **].  She has a chronic dry cough,
productive of small amounts of yellow or white sputum, and this
cough has not got worse of late.  No fevers, chills, weight
loss, night sweats, chest pain, palpitations, flu-like symptoms,
hemoptysis, abdominal pain, sick contacts.  Acknowledges
occasional wheeze.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.0 69 132/67 20 94% 3L She was
given duonebs, solumedrol 125 and started on levofloxacin for
possible COPD exacerbation.  Although her breathing became
easier, she continued to be tachypneic with RR>30, and she was
transferred to the ICU for this reason.  Vitals prior to
transfer were: 97.5 72 124/99 27 94% 3L

On arrival in the MICU, she is in no acute distress. Reports
that dyspnea has improved considerably since time of
presentation.  RR was down to <20 by time of arrival to floor.
Vitals were: 78, 121/61, 76, 23, 89% 3L.  On moving to use the
commode, her oxygen saturaton dropped to 89% and RR went up to
32, and oxygen was increased to 6L NS.  She continues to
intermittently desaturate to the high 80s with minimal exertion,
but remains asymptomatic with these desaturations.

Brief Hospital Course:
77F with multiple comorbidities, presents with gradually
worsening SOB and dyspnea on exertion, without evidence of
infection; treated for likely COPD exacerbation.

Active Issues:
=====================================
# COPD exacerbation:  Restrictive PFTs documented in [**2127**], but
reported history of COPD.  Patient presented with gradually
worsening respiratory function over several months. She denied
fevers, chills, sick contacts, URI [**Name2 (NI) 34370**], productive cough in
addition to CXR without infiltrate made pneumonia an unlikely
diagnosis. No tachycardia, EKG changes or other clinical
findings to suspect PE.  No EKG changes, chest pain to suggest
cardiac etiology. Initially in the ICU the patient was started
on azithromycin and converted to a prednisone 60mg x 10 day
taper. Her course was longer given her poor air movement on
exam. Her respiratory status was stable on 2-3L supplemental O2
and she was called out to the floor on HD#1. Pt did well on
prednisone taper and albuterol nebs, and completed 5 day course
of azithromycin on medicine floor on [**2135-9-26**]. Although she
reported improvement, she still desaturated while ambulating on
room air, and thus qualified for home O2 therapy. As pt derived
benefit from neb treatments, nebulizer machine/unit was
prescribed at discharge. Pt was discharged with VNA services,
home PT, and O2 2L NC after cleared by physical therapy. Blood
cultures were no growth to date at time of discharge.  She was
instructed to follow up with her PCP for consideration of
outpatient pulmonary referral should her symptoms not resolve in
another week. She last saw a pulmonologist in [**2127**].

Chronic Issues:
======================================
# Hypertension: Patient was continued on her home clonidine
patch, amlodipine, metoprolol, valsartan. SBP at discharge 130s.

# DM: Patient was on ISS during hospital course and continued on
her home metformin at time of discharge.

# HLD: Patient was continued on her home Crestor.

# Allergic rhinitis: Continued home fexofenadine prn.

# GERD: Continued omeprazole during hospitalization. Recommend
taper off omeprazole and switch to H2 blocker.

Transitional Issues:
====================================
-Pt has followup with PCP in one week: [**2135-10-3**]
-Have recommended she speak with PCP and seek repeat outpatient
PFTs and re-establish care with pulmonologist.
-Pt has oustanding micro date: f/u blood cultures (as of [**9-26**]
No growth to date).
-Pt is complete following taper:
Prednisone 30mg once a day on [**9-27**]
Prednisone 20mg once a day on [**2133-9-27**]
Prednisone 10mg once a day on [**11-11**]
**Last day of this medication will be on [**2135-10-1**].
Tapered dose - DOWN
-Pt will benefit from home PT for deconditioning and home O2
therapy
