History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] is a 64 yo man with dilated cardiomyopathy (presumed
non-ischemic) and severe aortic stenosis (valve are 0.8, peak
gradient 87) who was transferred from Holy [**Hospital 82745**] hospital for
further care of his aortic stenosis.  According to his initial
H&P on [**4-15**] Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] was admitted for dyspnea with minimal
activity, fatigue, orthopnea, and ankle edema.  He is delerius
on transfer and is unable to provide any more information.  Per
his wife he gets dyspneic usually upon ambulating from room to
room; this has worsened recently.  At [**Hospital3 **] he was (hct
24.7 & BUN 100) he was found to have have GI bleed; upper GI
showed minimal erosions; c-scope showed residual blood & R-colon
AVM that was cuaterized; he was also placed on octreotide.  For
an unclear reason he underwent cardiac cath today which showed
EF 25%, clean coronaries.  AVG 58 peak with mean 40.  PCW 16,
LVEDP 15, PA pressures of 85/29 & RVEDP 8.  After the cardiac
cath he became agitated, agressive, and was dyspneic requiring
4L.  bp 79/59, He was given 80mg IV lasix for presumed CHF.  He
was in afib with RVR at the time in 110-130's and was given po
toprol (50mg) & IV metoprolol (10mg).  no temp recorded.  Na
136, K 3.6, BUN 45, Cr 1.1, chloritde 105, bicarb 24. WBC
increased to 15.8.  VS prior to transfer: BP 160/56 HR 106 100%
on 4L.  RR 26-32.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] remembers nothing of the event.  Upon speaking with is
wife, he was not delerious, febrile, or agitated prior to the
cath.
.
On transfer Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] is delerius and febrile to 102.3, knows he
is in the hospital, unsure of which one.  Thinks the year is
[**2049**].  He cannot recall any of the symptoms leading up to his
hospitalization.  Currently he complains of fever and abdominal
pain.  He denies orthopnea, pnd, cough.  He is mildly dyspneic.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] is a 64 yo man with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe
aortic stenosis, OSA & pulmonary hypertension who was admitted
to the hospital for worsening dyspnea and is transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care. He expired after developing sepsis,
renal failure, acidosis and hypotension not responsive to
pressors.

# Sepsis/bacteremia: Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] was febrile to 105 on admission.
He was empirically covered with vancomycin/cipro/flagyl on
admission.  A central venous line was placed and he was
aggressively hydrated.  He became hypotensive on the night of
admission and was started on dobutamine + levophed.  Admission
blood cultures quickly turned positive for [**3-24**] MSSA.  His
antibiotics were changed to nafcilling.  TTE and TEE were
negative for endocarditis and repeat blood cultures remained
negative. He completed his course of nafcillin in-house. WBC
trended up and patient developed lactic acidosis in addition to
his leukocytosis. Culture data was negative at the time of
death. Patient was on broad spectrum antibiotics on [**2114-5-7**]
including vancomycin and zosyn. Patient was dependent on
pressors to keep MAPs greater than 55. As acidosis worsened,
patient became less pressor responsive and died in the presence
of his family.

# Cardiogenic shock: secondary to depressed EF and severe AS.
Maintained on dobutamine + levophed.  Diuresed with guidance of
swan-ganz catheter.  Mr. [**Known lastname 1511**] was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28946**] of CT
surgery for consideration of AVR, but was

# Dyspnea: likely multifactorial from fever, severe pulmonary
hypertension, COPD, and CHF.  Swan Ganz Catheter was placed and
he was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension; some of
which was responsive to diuresis (at near-systemic pressures at
highest).  He was aggressively diuresed.

# Transaminitis: From shock liver.  Resolved with supportive
care
.
# Abdominal pain: due to hepatitis.  RUQ US negative and pain
resolved.
.
# Aortic Stenosis: severe based on gradient and valve area.
Patient has had symptoms of refractory heart failure, but no
angina or syncope.  Depressed EF alone is indication for valve
repair.
- consider dobutamine echo to r/o pseudo aortic stenosis

# Atrial fibrillation - given amiodarone for rate control.  Had
