CXR [**2182-3-29**]: Evaluation limited due to low lung volumes, kyphotic

position and patient's chin obscuring the right lung apex.
Allowing for these limitations, cardiomegaly is again noted with
mild interstitial pulmonary edema. There is a chronic upper
lumbar vertebral body fracture. Right rib cage and left clavicle
shaft deformity again noted.

CXR [**2182-3-30**]: Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of
cavoatrial junction. There is no change in the cardiomediastinal
silhouette including cardiac engorgement. The patient is in mild
interstitial edema. Nodular opacity projecting over of the left
second anterior rib is redemonstrated and as was previously
mentioned, should be further evaluated with anterior shallow
obliques.

Portable Abdominal Xray [**2182-3-31**]: Improved ileus

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with history of TBI, seizure disorder, heart
failure, DVT, BPH with chronic indewlling foley and frequent
UTIs who was transferred from St. [**Hospital 66727**] hospital for
lethargy, fever, and confusion.  He was admitted to the ICU for
hypotension/sepsis.

#. Sepsis and Hypotension due to Pseudomonal UTI:
He was hypotensive on admission felt to be from a pseudomonal
UTI.  He had a right IJ placed in the ED and was given 5L normal
saline.  He was also briefly on Levophed due to hypotension.  He
was treated initially with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, and
azithromycin for possibility of pneumonia as well given
increased interstitial markings on chest xray.  His pressors
were stopped soon after admission and his blood pressure
remained stable after antibiotics were initiated.  When his
urine culture results were obtained, his antibiotics were
narrowed to cefepime to cover pseudomonas; this briefly changed
to cipro and then eventually to oral cefpodoxime (cipro was
discontinued due to concern for a lower seizure threshold as
well as potential interference with INR).  He should complete a
7 day course of antibiotics - last day [**2182-4-4**].
His recurrent UTIs were discussed with his urologist, Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) 770**], via email.  His chronic foley was removed.  Instead, he
will wear a condom cath and undergo clean intermittant
catheterization [**Hospital1 **].  A log should be kept with his urine
output.  He will follow up with urology.  He should start
macrobid 100 mg daily once he completes his course of
cefpodoxime to try to prevent recurrent UTIs in the futire.

#. Seizure disorder and bipolar disorder:  He was continued on
phenytoin, gabapentin, divalproex, and carbamazepine.
Zonisamide was also restarted as patient stated that he had been
taking it home; this will need to be clarified as an outpatient.

#. Thrombocytopenia: Felt to be related to acute infec
