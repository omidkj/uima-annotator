HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80 year-old white
male with a past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction times
three with recent stent placement, congestive heart failure
(with a recent admission), ICD placed (complicated by
ventricular tachycardia), end stage renal disease secondary
to FSGS on hemodialysis three times a week, prostate cancer,
hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia who was initially
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] from an
outside hospital with pleuritic chest pain that was not
relieved with nitroglycerin, but was relieved with Toradol.
His first set of cardiac enzymes at the outside hospital were
negative.  The patient had a recent admissions for congestive
heart failure the first being secondary to ICD firing and

prophylaxis.  The patient complained of mild nausea.  She
denies abdominal pain, fevers, chills, calf pain, shortness
of breath, diarrhea, diaphoresis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission to the MICU
were temperature 97.2.  Blood pressure 116/53. Pulse 80.
Respirations 20.  100% on 3 liters nasal cannula.  The
patient was in no acute distress.  Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Oropharynx was dry.  The patient with
right IJ in place.  Bibasilar crackles.  Cardiovascular S1
and S2, regular rate and rhythm.  Positive rub heard.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities no edema.  Left
AV fistula, left arm AV fistula with bruit.  Cranial nerves
II through XII intact.  Alert and oriented.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 12.7, hematocrit 34.3,
platelets 270, D-dimer 1157, CK 11, MB of 2, troponin T 0.02.
Outside hospital CK was 15, troponin T was 0.025.  Potassium
5.5, creatinine of 7.3, BUN 68.  Echocardiogram showed an
ejection fraction of 45%, mild pulmonary hypertension.  Chest
x-ray showed stable cardiac enlargement, upper zone
redistribution without overt pulmonary edema, persistent left
lower lobe opacity (pneumonia versus atelectasis).  CTA
showed bibasilar atelectasis, resolution of bilateral pleural
effusions and diffuse ground glass opacities, residual
thickening reflex, residual mild pulmonary edema, no PE.
Urinalysis was positive for nitrites, greater then 300
protein, large blood, moderate leukocytes, 21 to 50 red blood
cells, greater then 50 white blood cells and occasional
bacteria.  PT 14.4, INR 1.4, and PTT 31.6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 80 year-old male with
coronary artery disease status post stent placement with ICD
and end stage renal disease on hemodialysis who is
transferred from outside hospital with pleuritic chest pain.

1.  Pleuritic chest pain:  The patient is admitted with
pleuritic chest pain. He has cardiac enzymes negative times
three for an myocardial infarction.  CTA was negative for PE
and echocardiogram showed ejection fraction of 45%, mildly
depressed left ventricular function, mildly thickened aortic
valve and mitral valve, 1 to 2+ mitral regurgitation, mild
pulmonary hypertension, no effusion.  On hospital day number
two the patient's cardiac friction rub disappeared.  A repeat
echocardiogram was done to rule out new effusion.  A
physiologic effusion was noted.  No change from prior study
from the day before.  Etiology of chest pain unclear.
Appears to be noncardiac.  Possible gastrointestinal
etiology.

2.  Hypotension:  In the Emergency Department the patient
became hypotensive to a systolic blood pressures of 83 and he
was started on a Dopamine drip and a right IJ was placed and
intravenous fluids were given.  His systolic blood pressure
increased to the 90s to 100s and Dopamine was discontinued.
Initially he was started on Zosyn and Vancomycin for
questionable sepsis.  The patient was transferred to the MICU
overnight for observation.  His hypotension resolved and he
was transferred the next day to the regular cardiac floor.
The patient's hypertensive medications were held during
hospital stay.  Prior to discharge his beta blocker and a low
dose ace inhibitor were restarted.  In addition the patient
received 1 unit of packed red blood cells during hemodialysis
for a drop in his hematocrit, however, his blood pressure
remained stable.  Cause of hypotension is unclear.  This
could be secondary to taking all of hypertensive medications
at the same time versus SIRS versus sepsis.  Two sets of
blood cultures were negative.  Urine cultures were positive
for coag negative staph.  Chest x-ray was negative for
pneumonia.

3.  End stage renal disease:  The patient received
hemodialysis while at [**Hospital1 69**].
He is followed by the renal consult team.

4.  Urinary tract infection:  The patient with a history of
staph epididymis urinary tract infection in the past.  During
this hospitalization his urine was positive for staph
epididymis.  The patient was maintained on Zosyn for five
days.  He was discharged to home without antibiotics.

5.  Hematology:  The patient's hematocrit dropped from 34.3
to 29.6 and he received 1 unit of packed red blood cells
during dialysis.  In addition, he was guaiac positive.  An
outpatient colonoscopy is recommended for further evaluation.

6.  Hypothyroidism:  The patient was maintained on Synthroid.

7.  Prophylaxis:  PPI and subcutaneous heparin were given.

8.  Anticoagulation:  The patient was kept on Coumadin for a
factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], goal INR 1.3 to 1.5.

9.  FEN:  He was on a cardiac and renal diet.

10.  Coronary artery disease/hypertension:  The patient was
maintained on aspirin, Plavix and Lipitor.  Beta blocker, ace
inhibitor and nitrate were held during this admission.  His
beta blocker and a low dose ace inhibitor were restarted
prior to discharge.  The patient will be followed as an
outpatient and his blood pressure will be monitored by home
nursing aids.  His blood pressure medication will slowly be
added back as needed.

11.  Loose stools:  The patient had multiple episodes of
loose stools and C-difficile culture was sent and it was
negative.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good, blood pressure stable,
tolerating a po diet.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Transient hypotension requiring Dopamine drip.
2.
