Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
back/knee pain, "sickle cell crisis"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
exchange-transfusion 12 units


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 65556**] is a 21 y/o man with sickle-cell anemia who presents
from OSH with 2 days of severe pain, mostly localized to his
lower back and knees bilaterally. He also has a headache that
started this AM, localized to the R occipital region. He states
that the onset of pain began 2d ago when he was carrying water
into the house from outside. He was dressed in a coat and denies
feeling cold at that time. He denies traumatic injury from heavy
lifting. He recalls that he drank alcohol on Saturday, but did
not feel dehydrated and has been drinking the "regular" amount
of fluid. He attempted to treat the pain initially with
oxycodone and excedrin, but it did not resolve.
.
Hence on [**2176-3-25**], he went to [**Hospital3 4107**] where he was
evaluated and started on dilaudid and IVF. Because of his
elevate WBC count (20->25), and concern for meningitis he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further w/u and pain management.
.
He states this pain is similar in location and severity to
sickle-cell crises he has had in the past. On ROS, he denied CP,
SOB, cough, sinus conjestion, sore throat, N/V, diarrhea,
constipation, and urinary symptoms. ROS otherwise normal.
.
His most recent crisis was approximately in [**Month (only) **]. of last year.
His regular triggers for sickle-cell crises include dehydration
and sometimes cold.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was continued on dilaudid and evaluated with
CXR and MRI of the back. he was also given IV fluids and a dose
of Levofloxacin.

Past Medical History:
Sickle cell anemia: Treated last year with hydroxurea and folic
acid, but that was stopped due to "swelling and pain" in feet.
Last crisis about 6 months ago.

Social History:
Attends college, studies computer engineering and technology.
Denies smoking/IVDU. Occasional social alcohol.

Family History:
Parents in good health. Two siblings, neither with SCA.

bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
CXR Admission: Patchy right lower and possible patchy left lower
lung opacities. Mild cardiomegaly with vascular redistribution
consistent with volume overload.
.
CXR Portable [**2176-3-26**]: 1. Bilateral lower lobe consolidations.
Pulmonary infarcts may be a possibility in this patient with
sickle cell crisis
2. Absence of splenic [**Last Name (LF) 65557**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be secondary to
autosplenectomy.
.
CXR [**2176-3-27**]: 1. Increased bibasilar pleural effusions and/or
atelectasis.
2. Diffuse increase in bony density.  Sclerotic changes in the
right humerus which may represent prior bony infarcts.
.
CXR [**2176-3-28**]: Progression of pneumonia and sickle crisis.
.
CT Chest: Multilobar pneumonia, with possible pneumococcal
etiology.  Some
of the consolidation may also be due to the sickle cell crisis.
.
MRI Lumbar/Thoracic Spine: 1. No evidence of epidural abscess.
2. Heterogeneous signal within the L2 through L4 vertebral
bodies, raising the possibility of bone infarcts.
3. Evidence of T12-L1 laminectomy.
.
EKG: Sinus tachycardia, rate 130. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities are present. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
ECHO: The patient is tachycardic. Normal biventricular size and
systolic
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Mildly elevated pulmonic
valve velocity c/w trivial PS (vs high output).
.
KUB: There are distended loops of large bowel, partially filled
with stool.  There is no definitive evidence of obstruction. The
patient is rotated, limiting evaluation for stones or osseous
abnormalities. Osseous structures appear grossly unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 21 y/o man with sickle-cell anemia who presented with
two days of severe pain in his lower back and knees similar to
previous pain he has experienced during sickle-cell crises. His
hospital course was complicated by respiratory distress, with
concern for acute chest syndrome vs. PNA. He received an
exchange-transfusion of 12 units, three days of vancomycin and
was started on a 14-day course of levofloxacin. He was
discharged in stable condition, with good oxygen saturations and
markedly reduced pain.
.
Sickle-Cell crisis: The pt.'s crisis was treated with IV fluid
and pain was managed with narcotic medications. He was intitally
started on a Dilaudid PCA, but this was switched to Fentanyl
when the pt. began to have a pruritic and myoclonic reaction. He
tolerated the fentanyl well, and was switched to prn percocet
with good pain control prior to discharge.

Acute Chest Syndrome vs. PNA: Hi
