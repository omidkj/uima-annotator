History of Present Illness:
This is a 28yoF 28 [**6-6**] wks pregnant w/h/o asthma, tobacco use,
narcotic addiction who presents w/ARDS due to progression of
bilateral s.pneumonia PNA. Per OSH records and signout from OSH
pulmonary fellow, pt presented to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital ED [**2-16**]
w/N/V/myalgias, Fever to 101.1, chills and productive cough
associated w/CP.  There, she was found to have CXR c/w BL PNA.
At that time, physicians wanted to admit her for treatment of
PNA, but she refused admission and was discharged AMA w/a Z-pak.
 She then presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2-18**] w/similar sx
including fever/chills and progressive SOB.  She was afebrile
upon presentation sating 92%on RA.  Gram stain from [**Hospital1 8**]
was c/w strep pneumo so she was started on Ceftriaxone and
duonebs.   She was also started on Solumedrol 60mg IV q8h w/some
improvement in her respiratory status. Earlier on the day of
admission, pt was transferred to OSH ICU where her initial ABG
showed 7.41/40/70. She was started on NPPV, but she appeared to
be tiring. The decision was made to intubate the pt prior to
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.  A repeat ABG prior to her transfer was
7.18/73/237 on AC 400, 100%FI02, PEEP 8, RR 20. Also, per report
pt had received around 5L IVF during her stay at the OSH. Prior
to transfer, abx were broadened to Vanc/Zosyn/Azithromycin.

.
[**2142-2-21**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1) Diffuse bilateral confluent alveolar opacities most
consistent with severe multifocal pneumonia with possible
progression to ARDS.
2) NG tube terminates before the GE junction and should be
advanced at least 20 cm.
.
[**2-24**] MRI/MRV/MRA head
IMPRESSION: Multiple confluent focal abnormalities in both
cerebral hemispheres as well as in the cerebellum. The
distribution and appearance of the lesions along with the
clinical history are consistent with posterior reversible
encephalopathy syndrome. No evidence of slow diffusion is seen
in these foci of signal abnormalities. No mass effect or
hydrocephalus.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA demonstrates normal flow signal within the arteries
of anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head.
MRV OF THE HEAD:
The head MRV demonstrates normal flow within the superior
sagittal and transverse sinuses as well as in the deep venous
system.
IMPRESSION: Normal MRV of the head.

ATTENDING NOTE: Subtle hypodensities are seen at the convexity.
Patient already had an MRI showing diffuse hyperintensities
suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy.

[**2-26**] RUQ U/S
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Liver demonstrates normal
echotexture, without any evidence of focal abnormalities. The
visualized portions of the pancreas are normal in appearance
though distal body and tail are not well evaluated. There is no
intra- or extra- hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There is
sludge/stones within the gallbladder, without any evidence of
gallbladder dilatation or wall edema.
Doppler evaluation of the liver was performed. The main portal
vein and its branches demonstrate normal hepatopetal flow and
waveforms and patency. The hepatic veins are patent with
appropriate directional flow. The hepatic artery demonstrates
normal arterial waveforms.
IMPRESSION: Normal appearance of the liver. Normal hepatic
vasculature.
.
[**2-26**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This 24 hour EEG telemetry is most consistent with
an
encephalopathic appearance. No seizure activity was detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pneumonia: Upon transfer from OSH, the patient's chest
radiograph showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates, thought
secondary to progressive pneumoccal pneumonia. Her initial
PaO2/Fi02 was 129. She was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics initially vancomycin, zosyn, and azithromycin. She
was initially treated per ARDS protocol, but subsequently her
oxygenation improved and she was quickly weaned off the vent.
She was extubated initially on [**2-23**]. She was reintubated on [**2-24**]
following a seizure and need for C section, as described below.
She was again extubated on [**2-25**].
Her antibiotics were narrowed to ceftriaxone and azithromycin,
which were discontinued on [**2-26**].  By discharge, she was on room
air, weaned off prednisone taper (for presumed reactive airway
disease).  She will follow up with outpatient pulmonary
department on discharge.

2. Seizure: On [**2-24**], the patient developed lip smacking with R
head deviation progressing to generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
Her seizures broke with 2mg lorazepam. Prior to her seizure, she
had been hypertensive to 174/100. She was seen by the neurology
service who recommended MRI, which revealed evidence of
posterior encephalopathy thought [**3-3**] to eclampsia. She was
treated with IV magnesium and underwent an emergent C section on
[**2-24**]. Per neurology she will not need maintenance anticonvulsant
therapy however was counseled *** she should not drive for 6
months *** following her seizure. She did not experience any
further seizures.

3. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressures in the
setting of proteinuria, seizures, and elevated LFTS were thought
to be eclampsia related. She was intiially treated with a
labetalol drip and subsequently hydralazine. Her blood pressures
remained elevated after c-section, and were treated with oral
nifedipine CR 60 mg po qday and labetolol 300 mg po BID.  She
was given a prescription for a home automated blood pressure
cuff, with instructions to record AM values for her next primary
care appointment.  Her husband is an [**Name (NI) 9168**] and understood to bring
her back to the hospital with BP greater than 150/90 mmHg or
symptoms such as heachache, chest pain, seizure.
