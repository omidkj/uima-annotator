Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
This [**Age over 90 **] yo female presents with lethargy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.

History of Present Illness:
Pt is [**Age over 90 **] yo f with HTN, HOCM, dementia, ? COPD, L hip fracture
several months ago who presented on [**12-29**] from [**Hospital1 1501**] with fatigue
and confusion, found to have a worsening effusion, ? PNA, and a
UTI. She was treated with levofloxacin, and has been afebrile.
At 2 AM today, pt triggered for desaturation into 70's on 2L O2,
and was responsive only to sternal rub. Suctioning only returned
thin secretions. She had been getting IVF, which were then
stopped. Her O2 sat improved to 98% on 100% NRB. ABG at 7 AM on
40% FM showed 7.15/104/77. She was then weaned down on her O2 to
3L with sats remaining in mid 80's. Attending physician spoke to
son, who confirmed DNR/DNI status, but agreed to a trial of
non-invasive ventilation in the ICU. Repeat ABG at 10am on 3L O2
showed 7.27/76/51.
.
Pt currently is moaining intermittently, but is not responsive
to verbal commands. Appears to be in mild respiratory distress.

ECG ([**12-29**]) - Normal sinus rhythm. Voltage for left ventricular
hypertrophy. Atrial premature complexes. No significant change
since the previous tracing of [**2175-3-30**].
.
CXR ([**12-29**])
FINDINGS: AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
There is interval increase in right-sided pleural effusion,
moderate in size. There is fluid noted in the minor fissure on
the right as well. Hazy opacity at the right lung base may
reflect tapered fluid, though underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded. There is increased left retrocardiac density which may
be on the basis of atelectasis versus pneumonia. Heart size is
difficult to assess but appears grossly unchanged. Mediastinal
contour is unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. Old right
humeral neck fracture is noted. Calcifications in the left
humeral head may represent bone infarct. Diffuse
demineralization of bone is noted with degenerative changes in
the spine. Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Increased right basilar pleural effusion. Increased
haziness at the right lung base may represent fluid versus
pneumonia. Left retrocardiac density may reflect atelectasis
versus pneumonia.
.
CT Head ([**12-29**])
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage, mass, edema, or acute large vascular
territorial infarction. There are global age-related parenchymal
involution changes with proportionate prominence of the
ventricles and sulci. Regions of hypoattenuation in the
periventricular white matter are consistent with chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. No fractures are evident.
Mastoid air cells, external auditory canals, and visualized
paranasal sinuses are clear. Patient is status post bilateral
lens placement.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process. Unchanged
appearance from [**2175-2-17**].
.
CXR ([**1-3**])
FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous examination from
[**2176-1-2**]. The extent of the right-sided pleural effusion shows
further increase. Just a small portion of the apical right lung
parenchyma is still normally ventilated. In the left lung, signs
of progressive fluid overload are seen. Progressive retrocardiac
atelectasis.
IMPRESSION: In comparison to [**2176-1-2**], further increase of the
right-sided pleural effusion and of the signs of fluid overload
evident in the left lung.

Brief Hospital Course:
91-yo F with HTN, HOCM, dementia, ? COPD, who presented with UTI
and ?pna, now with respiratory failure.
.
#. Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Pt has a possible history
of COPD which is likely contributing to her hypercarbia, and she
is also known to have a large and worsening right-sided pleural
effusion, although these are unlikely to have caused her acute
respiratory failure. Pt was noted to become very hypertensive
and desaturate, raising the probability of flash pulmonary edema
that may have caused acute respiratory failure, as well as a
possible aspiration episode and pneumonia. We are unable to
rule-out an underlying pneumonia, especially given the acute
rise in her WBC with left-shift, which is resolving now while on
Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl in addition to her
Levofloxacin. She had been transferred to the ICU for a trial of
BiPap, which she failed because of her agonal breathing as she
was unable to time her breaths well on BiPap, and she had
worsening of her ABG on BiPap as well. She continues to maintain
her vital signs well, although she continues to have worsening
ABGs. Discussion with family regarding goals of care are
consistent with not elevating the current level of care, but not
backing off on current measures either.  She was continued on
her antibiotics: Levofloxacin (day 6), Vancomycin (day 3),
Aztreonam (day 3), and Flagyl (day 2). She was also treated with
nebulizers and morphine as needed.
.
#. Hypertension - Pt noted to have an episode of hypertension
with SBP 200s. Timing associated with desat to 70s, possibly
contributing to flash pulmonary edema as above, but also raising
possibility of prior stroke to account for pt's current mental
status. Given morphine 1mg IV x1 with good effect. She has had
no acute hypertensive episodes since.  She was treated with
morphine 1mg IV PRN.
.
#. UTI - Urine Cx growing Gram +, alpha-hemolytic bacteria, c/w
alpha-Strep vs. Lactobacillus. Pt afebrile, but with increased
WBC and left-shift, now trending downward.  She was treated with
Levofloxacin and other antibiotics as above.
.
#. Acute renal failure / hype
