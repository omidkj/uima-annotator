Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
57M  with HTN, DM Type II, CAD s/p MI in [**2175**], ESRD (baseline Cr
of 6.6) not on HD currently being screened for transplant, who
presented to the ED [**2180-8-4**] complaining of SOB over a few hours,
followed by chest discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. He denied
fevers or chills. He had taken two sublingual NTG tabs at home,
and reported some substernal 8/10 chest pain in the ED.  An
initial CXR in the ED showed clear lung fields, however a repeat
demonstrated flash pulmonary edema.  BiPAP was tried, however he
did not tolerate it and ended up vomiting. As he didn't tolerate
BiPAP, he was intubated. His BP, 180s SBP in the ED, was
initially controlled with NTG and propofol drips. At the time of
transfer to the CCU, he was changed to fentanyl and midazolam
drips, which made the pt normotensive and comfortable. While in
the ED, he was also treated with morphine 2mg IV, lasix 40 IV x1
and put out 370mL urine over 3 hours.  An ASA was given with
EMS. The patient was home alone the night he presented, so it is
possible he did not take his evening BP meds without his
girlfriend around to remind him. Tox screen was negative.

CXR 2AM [**8-5**] Findings consistent with mild CHF
CXR 4AM [**8-5**] Interval development of pulmonary edema with fluid
overload with upper lobe venous congestion, and fluid in the
minor fissure.

Echo [**8-5**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal inferior septum
and basal inferior wall. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 45-50 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

ECG [**8-4**] 2AM: normal sinus rhythm with prolonged QT at 422msec.
No ST segment abnormalities noted. Repeat study at 3:30AM showed
a normal QT.

Brief Hospital Course:
57M with DM-II, HTN, CAD s/p MI in [**2175**], and ESRD not on HD who
presented with SOB and CP and had flash pulmonary edema in the
setting of hypertensive urgency in the ED.
.
# CORONARIES: Known CAD s/p MI in [**2175**]. As the pat is new to our
system, his anatomy is unknown to us. During this
hospitalization, pt recieved ASA 325mg PO daily instead of his
usual home 81mg. No acute ECG changes were found during
hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were followed and ruled out MI.
Lipid panel showed an LDL of 31 and a slightly elevated total
cholesterol of 166, so no statin was started.
.
# PUMP: Pt clinically presented with flash pulmonary edema. Echo
showed EF 45-55%, mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy,
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD, mild mitral
regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Patient was
able to be weaned off the ventilator and successfully extuibated
day 2 of hospitalization. Pt has vigorous response to IV Lasix
initially and was euvolemic for the rest of the admission.
.
# RHYTHM: Patient was in NSR until day 2 of admission when rates
of 140s-150s were seen on tele. ECG showed A Fib. Patient had no
known diagnosis of A Fib. Given his HTN and cardiac disease, it
was felt that the patient likely had undiagnosed paroxysmal A
Fib. He was already on a BBlocker for rate control, and coumadin
was started. INRs were follwed by CCU team and pharmacy. Pt's
PCP made aware of new Dx of A Fib and anti-coagulation. Pt given
a prescription to have INR checked in dialysys the day after
discharge with results to be faxed to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital 2082**].
.
# HTN / Hypertensive urgency: Blood pressures were difficult to
control. Clonidine was switched to a patch to prevent rebound
from missing a dose, but ultimately d/c as made pt sommulent.
Able to decrease home dose of hydralazine from 100mg [**Hospital1 **] to 50mg
TID by adding amlodipine 10mg daily. Patient had been titrated
up to max BBlocker dose prior to the initiation of HD, but with
HD the dose was lowered to metoprolol 75mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt got his home
dose of Lasix as requested by renal, 40mg daily. Renal US showed
no revidence of renal vascular disease as a cause of refractory
HTN.
.
# ESRD: Renal follow the patient throughout admission. Cr rose
from 4.8 to 5.7 ultimately before the initiation of dialysis. Pt
began HD [**8-8**]. Nephrocaps were continues throught admission, and
calcium acetate was started per renal recs. He had three days of
a row of uneventful diaysis, but did experience hypertension
follwing the third HD treatment. During his 4th HD treatment on
[**8-12**], he had an episode of tacycardia into the 120s that resolved
with his usual AM dose of metoprolol. pt is on an afternoon
outpatient dialysys schedule, so will have morning meds on board
prior to dialysis to prevent HTN and tachycardia during HD.
Patient is scheduled for regular Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday
dialysis at [**Location (un) **] - [**Location (un) 86**] Dialysis Center.
.
# Nausea: Intermittent complaint throughout admission. Normal
ECG and cardiac enzymes during episodes of nausea, so unlikely
an anginal equivalent. Episodes oftern required anti-emetics and
anxiolytics to resolve. The afternoon after the third course of
HD, the patient began to feel nauseated and have shaking chills.
SBP was 190s as he had not recieved his BP meds prior to
dialysis. Pan cultures were negative. Symptoms were managed with
hydralazine, NTG, and Ativan. CT was done to rule out an
intraabdominal infection or process; it showed 2 enlarged
mesenteric lymph nodes, likely reactive. No evidence of
mesenteric ischemia or infection. Patient should have f/u CT in
3 months to re-evalute lymph nodes. No nausea was reported on
day of discharge.
.
# Diabetes: The patient's home dose of Lantus was given during
admission. Ele
