Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2147-8-29**]. He was consented for elective
IVC filter placement and taken to the operating room day of
admission. He underwent placement of Cook Celect IVC filter via
right common femoral vein. He was treated pre- and
postoperatively with fluid and bicarb for his decreased renal
function (Cr 1.7). He did well postoperatively and was taken to
the floor in good condition. He was consented for an elective
repair of his abdominal aortic aneursym. CBC, Chemistry, u/a,
coags, CXR, and EKG were checked preoperatively.

On [**2147-8-31**] he underwent open repair of AAA with suprarenal
crossclamp distal to the renal artery. He tolerated the
procedure well and was taken to the ICU postoperatively for
further monitored care. Postoperatively he was extubated on POD1
and remained stable on nasal cannula. Pain was controlled with a
thoracic epidural and dilaudid PCA. His foley was removed POD2
and he was out of bed to chair. The epidural was d/c'd POD3 and
pain remained well controlled. his diet was advanced to sips of
clears. He was moved to a floor bed on POD 4. The PCA was d/c'd
and pain was well controlled. Physical therapy worked with him
while he was on the floor. Coumadin was restarted [**2147-9-4**] at his
home dose and daily INR's were followed and became therapeutic
prior to discharge. On [**9-5**] he was noted to have some erythema
surrounding the incision and he was started on Ancef for
cellulitis. He continued to take minimal clear liquids. As he
had some nausea and discomfort EKG was checked and troponins
were cycled and were normal. An upright KUB on [**9-6**] showed no
evidence of ileus or obstruction. Coumadin was restarted [**9-8**]
and followed with daily INR checks. He continued to have bowel
movements and pass gas but intake was <200cc/day on a clear
liquid diet. A PICC line was placed [**2147-9-7**] for initiation of
TPN. However that night he had a large bowel movement with
resolution of nausea and increased PO intake. His diet was
advanced on [**2147-9-8**] and he tolerated general diet with no
nausea/vomitting. He continued to work with physical therapy.

He is discharged home on POD 10 from open AAA repair. He is
afebrile, hemodynamically stable, tolerating a general diet with
no issues, voiding, ambulating without assistance, with no pain.
He will follow up in clinic and has home services set up to
monitor his INR starting tomorrow.
