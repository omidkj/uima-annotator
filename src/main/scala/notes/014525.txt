Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3233**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Posterior spinal instrumentation T1-L3.
2. Posterior spinal fusion T1-L3.
3. Application of interbody biomechanical device T6-T9.
4. Interbody fusion T6-T9.
5. Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
68 yo F with RA, fibromyalgia, OA with 2 ED visits in last 2
days (this is third) for L sided chest pain with SOB. Was seen
here in ED, CE negative, Ddimer elevated at 5000, VQ scan
negative, no other lab abnormalities and she was d/c'ed home.
When she arrived home, the security guard there noted pt to be
struggling getting into apt and call EMS for transport back to
ED. He checked her O2 say and she was reportedly hypoxic to 84%
though there is no documentation. Patient reports she has midl
pain at rest but extreme 10/10pain with any movement. Denies any
rashes over area of pain, she has received zoster vaccine.
States she has had this pain for the last 2 1/2 months which has
worsened recently - no inciting factor.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.1, 68, 121/69, 16, 98%2LNC. no
additonal labs were drawn, she received no pain meds. XR showed
new small L sided effusion compared to CXR done yesterday. Pain
is reproduicble. FAST exam negative. Is admitted for pain
control.
.
Upon evaluation in the ED patient reports her pain feels better
without movement. She denies any current SOB. Room air sat
checked and is 90% which normalized to 100% with 2L nc.

4. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CT chest wo contrast [**7-12**]: Linear opacity in the b/l lungs
likely represents atelectasis, but underlying infection cannot
be excluded. Multiple lytic bone lesions involving multiple
vertebral bodies/posterior elements, ribs, sternum could
represent metastatic disease or multiple myeloma (new since CXR
of [**2161-8-18**]). Lytic lesions most severe at T3, T7 and T12 where
there is destruction of the osseus vertebral body cortex and
extension of soft tissue density into the spinal canal and
collapse of T7 vertebral body. Cannot exclude cord involvement.
MRI could be obtained for further evaluation if concern for cord
involvement or compression. Debris within proximal esophagus
raises concern for aspiration risk. d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 9:30
pm.
.
MRI spine [**7-13**]: Diffuse bone marrow replacement throughout the
cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine consistent with widespread
osseous malignancy, most likely metastatic disease. Multilevel
epidural soft tissue components with evidence of cord
compression at the T3 vertebral body level without intrinsic
cord signal abnormalities. Loss of height of the T7 vertebral
body with diffuse bone marrow infiltration, concerning for
pathologic compression fracture. Ventral epidural component
narrowing the thecal sac and abutting the ventral spinal cord
without evidence of cord compression.
Multilevel degenerative disc disease throughout the cervical and
lumbar
spine.
.
Skeletal survey [**7-13**]: SKELETAL SURVEY: There are multiple
punched-out lytic lesions without a sclerotic rim in calvarium,
the largest measuring at least 1.5 cm. Multiple similar lytic
lesions are seen in the right and left humeri and bilateral
clavicles. In the left humerus, there is a large lytic lesion in
the mid diaphysis with endosteal scalloping with this lesion at
risk for pathologic fracture. There are no significant
abnormalities of the visualized lung. The ribs bilaterally have
a mottled appearance suggestive of lytic lesions. No discrete
lesion is identified on the AP projection of the chest. On the
lateral projection of the thoracic spine, there is loss of
vertebral body height and disc space narrowing seen at multiple
levels of the mid thoracic spine which correlates with the lytic
lesions and compression fracture deformities seen on prior CT
and MRI. No focal lytic lesions are seen in the
pelvis or sacrum or proximal femurs.
.
ECHO TTE [**7-14**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal systolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure overload. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
