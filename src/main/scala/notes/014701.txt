Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from OSH for [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath
pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 81 yo F w/ ho of HTN, hyperlipidemia, no CAD, ?TIA
presented to the OSH after developing SSCP and dizziness this
am, found to have inferior lateral [**First Name3 (LF) **] with tropinin of 11.1
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Pt developed an
episode, without any radiation, N/V/Diapheresis three days prior
to admission when temp was about 100F, resolved spontaneously
thought was heat related.  She has subsequently been doing until
late this morning after breakfast, when she felt dizzy, per pt
no chest pain at the time, fell to the floor and remained there
for some time.   per daughter, she found her on the floor,
diaphoretic, but alert, no nausea and vomiting, complaining of a
sudden onset of [**7-15**] SSCP, no radiation at the time, and no N/V,
called EMS.
.
EMS gave her sl nitroglycerin for CP ([**10-15**]) enroute to OSH
([**Hospital3 **]), not relieved. later relieved with morphine IV x 2.
.
At the OSH [**Name (NI) **], pt had EKG showed ST elevation in inferior
lateral leads (II, III, aVF, V5, V6) and corresponding ST
depression in V1 V2, right sided ECG not showing ST elevation in
V4R.  Pt was started on integrllin, heparin, but was D/C'ed when
pt developed acute onset of L sided hemiparesis (arm and leg
only), no change in speech or MS, spontaneously resolved after
1-2 hrs, head CT negative.  per daughter, she also had an echo
at OSH, ? pericardial effusion.  At the ED, she was given 5mg IV
lopressor, BP dropped to 60's, started with fluid resuscitation
5L [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
Intially, chest pain free, T 94.6, BP 98/54, cool mottled
skin,likely cardiogenic shock, and started dopamin 5->7.5mg/kg.
pt went to the Cath lab, which showed right dominant, LMCA mild
disease, LAD serial 80% stenosis, LCX 50-60% proximal, diffuse
70% OM1, and occluded OM2->stented->0% residual; RCA 90%
mid->stented->0% residual.  At the time of the cath, PCW mean
26, PA mean 22, PA (36/23) mean 28, RV (34/22) end 24, HR 75-77,
CI 1.76, given equalization of filling pressure across the
[**Doctor Last Name 1754**] worrisome for found tamponade, echo was done which
showed moderate size pericardial effusion.  Patient underwent a
fluoro guided pericardiocentesis with peridcardial pressure of
20mmHg, localized effusion with 150cc of bloody drainage with
Hct of 34) worrisome for pericarditis vs localized sealed
myocardial rupture. Cardiac surgery was consulted at the time,
for likely retamponade in the future.  She was back onto the CCU
floor, type and crossed 6 units of blood and off pressors, put
on ASA, plavix 75mg x 12 months, echo in 1 hour showed minimal
effusion localized to RV (total output ~100cc), keep SBP<110
given likely rupture, hemodynamic monitoring with A-line and PA.

.
Cardiac Cath ([**2176-8-10**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
sytem with
three vessel coronary artery disease. LMCA had mild disease. The
lAD had
sequential 80% lesions in the proximal and mid vessel. LCX had
an ostial
60% lesion and diffused 70% OM1 diseease. dital LCx and OM2 were

occluded. The RCA had moderate proximal disease and 90% mid
vessel
lesion.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Hemodynamic assessment showed elevated and equalised RA
pressure,
RVEDP and PCWP at 23 mm Hg. There was 15 mm Hg pulsus on aortic
pressure
tracing. Pericardial pressure was 23 mm Hg. Drainage of 150 cc
of bloody
pericardial fluid (hct 33) decreased the pericardial pressure to
10 mm
Hg. the blood pressure increased and pulsus resolved. The
patient was
weaned off Dopamin and cardiac index improved.
4. the RCA lesion was predilated with a 2.0 balloon and stented
with two
overlapping 3.0 Cypher stents with lesion reduction from 90 to
0%. The
final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no dissection and no
embolisation.  (see PTCA comments)
5. The LCX lesion was predilated with a 2.0 balloon and stented
with a
2.5 stent with lesion reduction to 0%. The final angiogram
showed TIMI
III flow with no dissection or embolisation. (see PTCA comments)

6. The moderate pericardial effusion was drained with
improvement of her
hemodynamic status. The drain was left in situ for overnight
drainage.
(see PTCA comments)
.
Serial Echo post cath showed stable and progressively decreasing
pericardial effusion.
.
Echo ([**2176-8-12**]): Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
c/w multivessel  CAD. Prominent anterior fat pad (vs.
hemorrhagic effusion without hemodynamic compromise). Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  LVEF 40-45%
.
Carotid Doppler ([**2176-8-14**]): Minimal plaque with bilateral less
than 40% carotid stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo F w/ HTN, hyperlipidemia, no CAD, p/w inferoposterior
[**Month/Day/Year **], likely occured prior to acute presentation, Q waves
present in inferior leads, now in cardiogenic shock s/p cath and
pericardiocentesis.   Her hopsital course for this admission is
as follows:
.
1.  [**Month/Day/Year **]/pericardial effsuion/hypotension - IMI with posterior
extension s/p cath (three vessel disease, LAD 80% stenosis not
intervened, 50-60% proximal Lcx, 70% OM1, occluded OM2 stented,
mid RCA 90% stenotic, stent placed), possible small rupture
causing tamponade s/p 150cc bloody pericardial drainage, likely
causing cardiogenic shock. PA cathether and A line were placed
to assess CI and pressures.  Patient was placed on ASA 325',
