Chief Complaint:
Hyperkalemia, Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old female with a history atrial fibrillation
and diabetes mellitus II who was transferred to the MICU from
the ED for management of hyperkalemia. She presented to the ED
on [**5-31**] directly from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 30218**] office, where she was noted to
be fatigued, delirius, and with questionable oxygen saturations
(poor curve, 80% at one point). After being discharged on
[**2153-5-23**], she had done well at rehab. She was walking around.
Three days prior to admission here, she became more delirius and
fatigued. She was diagnosed with a UTI yesterday and was given a
dose of levofloxacin.
.
She had a recent admission from [**2153-5-13**] to [**2153-5-23**] when she
presented with metformin related lactic acidosis, SIRS, [**Last Name (un) **] and
hyperkalemia. She was dialyzed for three days. She developed a
left sided pneumothorax as a complication of HD line placement;
this was treated with pigtail placement and later chest tube
placement.
.
In the ED, her vitals were T97.9 HR 33 BP 125/45 and sat 98% 4L
Nasal Cannula.  She was found to have a K of 8, NA 130, CO2 15,
glucose 232, and lactate 1.6. She was treated with a total of 4g
of calcium gluconate, 14 units of insulin, 2 amp D50, 5
albuterol nebulizers, and aspirin 325mg. Her heart rate
increased with these interventions. An EKG revealed wider than
usual qrs in addition to peaked t waves.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, she had no acute complaints. She was
not short of breath.

DISCHARGE LABS:

MICRO:
[**2153-5-31**] Blood Cx: no growth to date
[**2153-5-31**] Urine Cx: no growth
.
IMAGING:
[**2153-5-31**] Portable CXR: The patient is rotated slightly to the
left. The previously noted tiny left pneumothorax is no longer
well appreciated. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiac
and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar
contours. No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Degenerative change
is noted at the right acromioclavicular joint.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old woman with a history of AFib, CHF, DM, with recent
hospitalization for [**Last Name (un) **] due to metformin-induced lactic
acidosis, who presented with delirium, dyspnea, [**Last Name (un) **], and
hyperkalemia.
.
# Acute kidney injury: FeNa 3.5% suggesting a intrinsic renal
etiology, likely from UTI leading to poor PO intake, decreased
renal perfusion and ATN. Supported by observation of muddy brown
casts on urine sediment. Lithium may also have been
contributing. We held the lithium and hydrated with IVF and
renally dosed medications and renal function improved. Lithium
was restarted at a reduced dose of 75mg daily upon discharge.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Likely due to [**Last Name (un) **]. She was given 1L NS with 1
amp of HCO3, lasix 80mg IV for forced diuresis, and kayexalate
30mg. Her urine output improved and her potassium normalized.
.
# Delirium: Patient was delirious on admission, likely due to
infection and hyperkalemia. No new meds or exposures to cause
delirium. Patient was frequently reoriented and received haldol
0.25mg PO as needed for agitation and sleep at night. Will
continue on standing haldol 0.25mg PO QHS for help with anxiety
and agitation at night.
.
# UTI: Complicated given recent hospitalization with foley and
recent antibiotic use. Urine culture in hospital negative after
2 days of Abx. Culture from rehab growing klebsiella and
pseudomonas both sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Will continue
ciprofloxacin 500mg for a 10-day course ([**Date range (1) 30219**]).
.
# Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia, likely combination of
iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease. Hematocrit was
stable throughout stay.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Chads2 score is 4 correlating with a high
risk of embolic phenomena, though the patient is currently only
anticoagulated with ASA 81mg. The patient was started on 1mg
coumadin daily on discharge after discussion of goals of care
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
# CHF: EF of 35%. Patient is euvolemic on exam and no evidence
of pulmonary edema on CXR. Patient continued on aspirin through
stay, and given metoprolol for rate control after episode of
tachycardia. Will continue home carvidelol 3.125 mg by mouth
twice daily on discharge.
.
# HTN: Patient was hypotensive through much of her stay.
Carvidelol held on admission and metoprolol given for rate
control. Will continue home carvidelol 3.125 mg by mouth twice
daily on discharge
.
# Diabetes: Patient was treated with humalog sliding scale while
in the hospital. She was restarted on glibizide 2.5mg by mouth
