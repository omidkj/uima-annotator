History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 80 yo F with PMHx sig. for HTN, hypothyroidism who
presents for dyspnea.  For the past 2-3 weeks, pt has noted
dyspnea on exertion to the point that climbing the 3 steps into
her mobile home made her SOB.  This AM she awoke at 6:00AM with
SOB, improved by sitting up.  She denies any chest pain.  She
called her PCP for an episodic visit.  EKG was performed and
showed new LBBB compared to previous EKG from [**6-3**].  She was
given ASA 325 mg and sent to the ED.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital3 **] ED, VS were:  T97.7, P120 (ranged
110-150), BP 166/107, RR 12, O2 sat 99% 2L NC.  She then became
dyspneic, dropped her O2 sats to 80%, and was placed on a NRB.
ABG on NRB was:  7.196/68/110.  Pt was then started on bipap,
ABG improved to:  7.35/44/94.  CXR showed "mild cm with
atel/infil/pl effu. rec f/u."  Pt was given 40 mg IV Lasix with
400 cc urine output and started on Lasix and nitro gtt.  Labs
were sig. for CK 40, ckmb 2.3, tropI 0.08
(0.00-0.50), BNP 308, d-dimer 0.70, and TSH 0.01.  VS prior to
transfer were:  HR 120s, BP 125/82, R 40, 95% on 50%
venturimask, UOP 750cc.
.
On review of symptoms, she was recently titrated up
levothyroxine in the past 3 months, starting from 25 mcg to the
current 100 mcg.  Since then, she has experience 15 lb weight
loss, heat intolerance, palpitations in the form of racing
heart, and tremor.  She denies any fever/chills.  She has 3 days
of dry cough.  She denies any hemoptysis, melena, BRBPR, urinary
problems, myalgias, joint pains.  All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain.
She has DOE, possible episode of PND this AM with orthopea.  She
denies any ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.
.



Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hypothyroidism

She reports a stress test many years ago, no echo or cardiac
cath.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism.
She is uptodate on breast and cervical screening with no past
abnormalities.  She has never had a colonoscopy.


Social History:
She lives with her husband in a mobile home and has 5 children.
She quit smoking in [**2085**], smoked 1ppd x 20 years.  She is a

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo F with PMHx sig. for HTN, hypothyroidism who presents for
dyspnea, treated as CHF exacerbation with TSH of 0.01 on 100mcg
of levothyroxine relatively recently with heat intolerance,
resting tremors.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:  There was concern for CHF
exacerbation given crackles on exam and elevated JVD.  Dyspnea
seems to be positional as well.  O2 sats improved on Bipap and
after Lasix at OSH.  CXR however did not show overt pulmonary
edema and BNP was not greatly elevated at OSH.  See pump below.
Given DOE, tachycardia, high O2 requirement, there was also a
concern for PE although pt has not been immobile, CTA was
negative.  Despite cough, no consolidation on CXR.
Hypermetabolism alone seems unlikely to cause this degree of
hypoxemia.  Patient previous to discharge was no longer dyspneic
on exam, satting 96 percent on 1L.
.
# CAD/Ischemia:  Pt denied any chest pain.  No sig STT wave
changes on EKG, ?q waves in III and AVF.  New LBBB was resolved
when rate controlled.  Troponin slighly elevated, CK flat,
likely [**2-27**] demand ischemia given tachycardia.  Troponins trend
is now prior to discharge.  Patient continued on aspirin,
started on metoprolol which was increased to 100mg TID for
better rate control.  Lipid panels and Hb1AC levels were also
obtained.
.
# Pump:  Pt has no prior echos in [**Hospital1 18**] system.  She may have
had cardiomyopathy from hyperthyroidism, tachycardia or
diastolic dysfunction [**2-27**] HTN.  Pt no longer looks fluid
overloaded, echo done on this admission shows an EF of 35
percent.
.
# Rhythm:  Sinus tachycardia, likely [**2-27**] hyperthyroidism.  Also
with concern for PE given O2 requirement.  Given rate in 130's,
metoprolol was uptitrated to 100mg TID.
.
# Thyroid imbalance:  Pt was recently started on levothyroxine
and is symptomatically hyperthyroid.  TSH at OSH was 0.01.
Given [**8-5**] day half-life of levothyroxine, patient's
levothyroxine dose was held.
.
# HTN:  Pt on HCTZ at home, given rising Cr to 0.8, held.
Patient was continued on metoprolol dose.
