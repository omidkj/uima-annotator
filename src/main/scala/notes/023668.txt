History of Present Illness:
This is a 38 AAF w/ no sig PMH who initially presented to
[**Hospital 1474**] hospital on [**12-24**] with a [**12-5**] wk h/o SOB, anorexia,
productive cough, subjective fevers/chills, and pleuritic CP.
Her admission VS were notable for a Tm 100.4, BP 106/60, HR 111,
and 87% sat on RA.  She was found to have a multilobular bilat
pneumonia and placed on CTX/azithro.  Over the next 48hrs, she
became progressively more tachypnic & hypoxic with sats dipping
into the 70s on 2L NC, prompting an ICU transfer and eventual
intubation on [**12-27**].  She was pancx'd and her antibiotic regimen
was empirically broadened to ceftaz/vanc/flagyl.  She was
initially on volume-control ventilation but soon switched over
to PCV [**1-5**] high PIPs on the evening of [**12-27**].  Of note, she was
disynchronous with the vent despite maximum doses of propofol,
versed, and morphine gtts and was ultimately started on a
vecuronium gtt on the night of [**12-27**].  CXR [**12-28**] revealed diffuse
bilat infiltrates c/w ARDS vs PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] prompting a bronchoscopy
and empiric administration of bactrim/solumedrol immediately
prior to transfer.  All cultures remain negative to date, and
she remains HD stable with no pressor requirement and normal
renal function.

         Trimethoprim/sulfa sensitivity confirmed by
[**Doctor Last Name 3077**]-[**Doctor Last Name 3060**].
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
