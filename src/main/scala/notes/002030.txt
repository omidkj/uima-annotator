Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely depressed
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2173-4-14**]
at 1505

Post bypass

Patient is in sinus rhythm and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine and milrinone. LVEF= 30%. RV function normal.
Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. It appears well
seated and the leaflets move well. The peak gradient across the
valve is 25 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgitation persists. Aorta is
intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**4-14**] where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement with a 21mm porcine valve and an aortoplasty.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the surgical intensive care
unit in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on post-operative day four the patient was ambulating freely,
the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
