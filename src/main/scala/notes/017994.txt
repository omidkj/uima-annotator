Pt is a 50 yo man with cirrhosis secondary to HCV and ETOH abuse
and baseline anemia who had an abdominal bleed after a routine
pericentesis to remove ascitic fluid, s/p transfusions, now

given fluids in an effort to address his falling
hematocrit/bleed. Now that pt is stable, will start to
diurese/remove fluid that has accumulated in his abdomen. Pt
notes that abdominal size is close to, but not as large as his

transfuse. Currently stable.
