Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

PDA)


History of Present Illness:
78 year old gentleman with a past medical history significant
for
diabetes, stroke, hypertension and dyslipidemia who has been
experiencing worsening fatigue and mild dypsnea on exertion over
the past year. More recently he has developed lower extremity
edema. An echocardiogram was performed which revealed moderate
mitral regurgitation. Stress testing was performed which showed
a
severe, fixed apical perfusion defect consistent with prior
infarction and an inferior perfusion defect. Septal ischemia was
also noted. A cardiac catheterization was performed which
revealed severe three vessel disease. Given the severity of his
disease, he was referred for sugical revascularization.

Prebypass

The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). A patent foramen ovale is present. There is a
bidirectional shunt across the interatrial septum at rest. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesia
of the apex, apical and mid portions of the anterior,
anteroseptal and inferior walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with mild
global RV free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2190-12-21**] at
900am.

Post bypass

Patient is A paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Mild mitral
regurgitation persists. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**12-21**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred
to the CVICU in stable condition on epinephrine, milrinone,
phenylephrine and propofol drips. Extubated that evening and
drips slowly weaned off. Passed swallowing exam after coughing
on pills. Transferred to the floor on POD #2 to begin increasing
his activity level. Gently diuresed toward his preop weight and
beta clockade titrated. Went into A Fib on [**12-25**] and amiodarone
and coumadin started. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per
protocol. Target INR 2.0-2.5. Continued to make good progress
and was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital **] HealthCare Center on
