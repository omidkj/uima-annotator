CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1.  Chest pain.
2.  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 70-year-old male
with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes type 2,
hypercholesterolemia, and chronic renal failure who presents
with three-day history of nausea, vomiting, progressive
shortness of breath, and chest pain.  The patient reports on
Monday night experienced some nausea and vomiting which was
transient.

The following evening the patient felt diaphoretic and
worsening shortness of breath.  Later that evening had slight
chest pain radiating into his back and neck.  When shortness
of breath worsened called 911.  Went to [**Hospital6 3874**] where his O2 saturation was 75%.  Patient was made
chest pain free with two sublingual nitroglycerin pills.
X-ray consistent with pulmonary edema.  Was diuresed with 140
mg intravenous Lasix.  Started on nitro drip and Heparin.
Transferred to [**Hospital6 256**].  At that
time troponins were 0.475.

Upon arrival patient was chest pain free with shortness of
breath much improved with Lasix diuresis.  Saturations 92% on
nonrebreather.

Patient sent to the Catheterization Lab where procedure
revealed 40% LMCA, 80 to 90% LAD just proximal to D1, and 80%
mid right coronary artery with diffuse disease, 60% PDA at
origin.  Cardiac output 6.0.  Cardiac index 2.9 with PCWP of
26.  Patient received two caths in the left anterior
descending and right coronary artery, and upon arrival at the
Coronary Care Unit reported no chest pain and great
improvement in shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Diabetes
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Chronic renal failure.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Greater than 50-pack year tobacco history;
quit 20 years ago.  Lives in [**Location 47**].  Positive alcohol,
though socially.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile.  Blood
pressure 119/61, 87, 26, 91% on 100% nonrebreather.  General,
pleasant, alert and oriented times three in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light,
extraocular movements intact.  Mucous membranes moist.
Positive jugular venous distention 5 cm.  Neck:  Supple.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2 normal without murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Respiratory:  Positive bibasilar rales, left
greater than right.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended;
had positive bowel sounds times four.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neuro exam:  Cranial nerves
II-XII grossly intact; no focal deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.2, hematocrit 34.5, platelets
197, INR 1.3, sodium 142, potassium 5.0, chloride 106,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 68, creatinine 2.1, glucose 176, CK 167,
MB of 9, troponin 0.78.

Chest x-ray consistent with bilateral effusions, left greater
than right; left retrocardiac air space opacity; increased
pulmonary vasculature with left lower lobe atelectasis.

EKG [**2108-11-23**] shows sinus rhythm at 95 beats per minute with
left axis deviation, ST depression 3 mm in V3 through V6.
Preceding echo at 6 a.m. at [**Hospital1 18**] sinus rhythm at 90 beats
per minute, ST depression in 1, AVL, V4 through V6.

Patient admitted to the CCU status post catheterization for
stenting of mid RCA and mid left descending.  Continue
diuresing for shortness of breath.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Patient held on ACE in lieu of elevated
creatinine.  Continued with aspirin, Plavix, Integrilin with
his discharge secondary to retinal hemorrhage.  Patient began
beta blocker and titrating up as blood pressure tolerated.
Patient diuresing well with Lasix held on Nesiritide at that
time.  Patient continued to be hemodynamically stable and
chest pain free.  Beta blocker was optimized, and patient was
continued on statin for history of hypertriglyceridemia.  CK
trended maximum post catheterization of 284 trended down to
167.  Patient at time of discharge was continued on home dose
of ACE of Zestril 20 mg p.o. q.d. with follow up of
creatinine.  Echo on Monday revealed systolic left
ventricular ejection fraction of 35 to 40% with 1 to 2+
mitral regurgitation, anteroseptal hypokinesis, overall
moderate ventricular systolic function depression.  Patient
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to optimize current
regiment of cardiac medication.

2.  Diabetes:  Tight control on regular insulin sliding
scale.  Blood sugars remained 150s.  At time of discharge
patient transitioned to Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

3.  Pulmonary:  Weaned off O2 on hospital day two.
Tolerating diuresis with normal electrolyte status.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 p.o. q.d. for another month.
2.  Toprol XL 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Follow up for Chem-7 in two days to be forwarded to
primary care physician for monitoring of creatinine function.
2.  Patient to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in two weeks as
well as primary care physician.
3.  Recommendations for cardiologist closer to patient's
home.
4.  Call if developing shortness of breath, chest pain.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
