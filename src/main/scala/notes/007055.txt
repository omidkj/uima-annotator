Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Resection of metastatic brain tumor
2. R craniotomy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old woman with classic migraines, breast
cancer with metastasis including to the right frontal brain, s/p
resection, currently on Doxorubicin for chemotherapy presenting
with increased seizures.

The day of presentation, the patient reports she had 3 seizure
episodes, each half an hour apart, and initially tried to wait
for the seizure to self-resolve.  The patient reports that,
similar to her prior seizure episodes, she developed left gaze
preference, left facial droop, expressive aphasia, and tonic
clonic movements beginning at 10pm, which woke her from sleep
and lasted about 5-15 minutes each.  This was longer than her
initial seizure episode [**2119-4-5**].  She was A&Ox3 and reports she
never lost consciousness, which is also typical of her seizures.
 She initially tried to wait for the seizures to resolve, but
then presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital where she had several two
additional seizure episodes.  The seizures were terminated with
ativan 2mg, 1mg IM and IV.  She was given Keppra 1000mg.

Per OSH records, the patient was sitting in a chair and
developed slurred speech and mild L facial droop, but was
conscious throughout the seizure and had normal strength in her
extremities.  Her symptoms were reported to resolve over 10
minutes.  She reportedly developed increased seizure frequency 1
month ago when her anti-seizure medications were decreased.  OSH
records also note that the patient developed a seizure after
transfer to the hospital bed.  A CT head was performed at
[**Hospital1 1562**] which showed right encephalomalacia, and volume loss,
no midline shift or ICH.  The patient denies recent fevers,
productive cough, acute vision changes (but does report her
vision has been blurry/slightly doubled without frank diplopia
since her neurosurgical procedure), abdominal pain, diarrhea,
dysuria, rash, focal numbness/tingling/weakness.  She does
report increased urinary frequency and increased urgency as well
as foul smelling urine, which she states are her typical
symptoms for a UTI.  She does report that since starting
steroids, she has been unable to sleep more than 3 hours at a
time and has been chronically sleep deprived.  She drinks one
cup of coffee daily which has not increased in quantity
recently, denies alcohol intake.  The patient was transferred
from [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
management.


Past Medical History:
- Metastatic breast cancer
(1) a right frontal craniotomy for resection of the metastasis
by
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**], M.D. on [**2117-12-23**]
(2) Cyberknife radiosurgery to the 1-right frontal lobe
resection
cavity to 2400 cGy (800 cGy x 3 fractions) at 84% isodose line
from [**2118-1-26**] to [**2118-1-28**]
(3) lumbar puncture on [**2118-6-23**] showed 0 WBC, 31 protein, and
negative cytology for malignant cells
(4) status post Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right
frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left
frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.
.
Her FDG-PET from [**2119-4-10**] did not show FDG uptake.  She
underwent a thallium-SPECT today and the official result is
pending.  She reports some evidence of word-finding difficulty
intermittently, particuarly when she is fatigued.  Her balance
remains good.  She remains off dexamethasone.  She does not have
headache, nausea, vomiting, seizure, imbalance, or fall. Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19**] will change her navelbine treatment to possibly
Doxil.
.
Her oncological problem began in [**2105**] when she palpated a mass
in the left breast.  A mammogram showed suspicious breast tumor.
 She underwent a left mastectomy with none of 11 lymph nodes
positive for tumor.  The pathology showed ER positive
infiltrating ductal carcinoma.  She received CAF chemotherapy,
followed by chest irradiation, and 5 years of tamoxifen.  She
was well until [**2112**] when she developed a cough and a chest X-ray
showed a shadow.  A work up at another institution revealed
metastatic breast cancer  to her subcarinal lymph node.  Biopsy
showed adenocarcinoma that was ER positive, PR negative, HER-2
negative by FISH.  She was then treated with Faslodex from
[**2114-11-6**] to [**2115-8-13**].  Subsequent work up revealed an esophageal
metastasis.  A right upper lobe transbronchial biopsy on
[**2115-6-26**] showed adenocarcinoma, and her treatment was switched
to Xeloda on [**2115-12-18**].  She the received external beam
mediastinum irradiation on [**2115-12-25**] to [**2116-1-29**] to 5,000 cGy.
She started weekly navelbine on [**2118-10-3**].
.
Her neurological problem began in later [**Name (NI) **] and early
[**2117-12-7**], with pounding [**Hospital1 **]-frontal headaches that radiated
to the occiput.  These headaches were worse with motion but
improved with Aleve.  She did not have night-time headache.  She
also had positional nausea and imbalance, but no vomiting.  A
gadolinium-enhanced head MRI on [**2117-12-21**] showed a right frontal
enhancing mass with surrounding cerebral edema, mass effect, and
2 mm of midline shift.  She had a craniotomy by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 548**],
M.D. on [**2117-12-23**] for resection of the right frontal mass.  The
pathology was ER positive metastatic breast carcinoma.  This was
followed by Cyberknife radiosurgery to the right frontal lobe
resection cavity to 2400 cGy (800 cGy x 3 fractions) at 84%
isodose line from [**2118-1-26**] to [**2118-1-28**].  She then had another
session of Cyberknife radiosurgery on [**2118-7-6**] at 2-right
frontal metastasis to [**2108**] cGy at 70% isodose line and 3-left
frontal metastasis to 2200 cGy at 77% isodose line.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
MR SPECTROSCOPY [**2119-5-15**]: Interval progression in the pattern of
enhancement at the right temporal frontoparietal lesion with
avid perfusion and increased signal on the corresponding ASL
sequence, concerning for tumor progression, there is also mild
increase in vasogenic edema extending at the external capsule as
described above. The most anterior frontal lesion appears
unchanged. No other lesions are identified.

MRI Brain Functional [**2119-5-18**]:  Functional MRI of the brain,
demonstrating the expected activation areas for the primary
motor cortex during the movement of the hands and feet and also
during the movement of the tongue, no significant areas of BOLD
activation are demonstrated adjacent to the right opercular mass
lesion.

[**2119-5-19**] MRI brain
There are stable post-surgical changes at the right
frontoparietal region, the anterior right frontal lesion again
measures 12 x 17 mm and the second right posterior frontal
lesion is also stable in size and involves the adjacent dura.
