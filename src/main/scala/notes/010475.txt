IMAGING

-CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2163-7-23**] 10:23 AM
FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a right posterior parietal
hemorrhagic
contusion measuring approximately 13.8 mm x 7.9 mm, with minimal
surrounding
edema. This is overall minimally changed from [**2163-7-22**] at
7:41 p.m.
There are no new foci of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift
of normally
midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial
infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and configuration,
without evidence
of hydrocephalus. There is periventricular white matter low
attenuation,
which is most compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease. Small
rounded hypodensity within the left basal ganglia may represent
a prior
lacunar infarct. Visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells
are well
aerated. There is no acute fracture. There is again demonstrated
a small
scalp hematoma overlying the right parietal convexity.
IMPRESSION: No significant change in the right posterior
parietal hemorrhagic contusion. No new foci of hemorrhage.

-CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2163-7-22**] 10:04 PM
FINDINGS: There is no fracture. Extensive degenerative changes
seen at the
craniocervical junction, including marked calcification of the
apical dental and posterior longitudinal ligaments, account for
the appearance on
concurrent head CT. The prevertebral and paraspinal soft tissues
are
otherwise unremarkable. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes
are noted, including degenerative loss of disc space height most
severe at C4/5. Prominent facet osteophytes are noted at
multiple levels, and small calcified disc bulges at C3-4 and
C4-5 mildly narrow the central canal, and slightly indent the
thecal sac. At C5-6, a larger calcified disc bulge moderately
narrows the thecal sac, and significantly indents the ventral
aspects of the cord, also causing moderate left neural foraminal
narrowing. Incidental note is made of large calcified right
thyroid nodule measuring roughly 1.8 cm.
Note also made of known comminuted right mid-clavicular and 2nd
rib fractures, with surrounding subpleural hematoma.
IMPRESSION
1. No fracture or cervical spine malalignment.
2. Extensive degenerative change as described above, including
prominent
subchondral cystic change within the dens, and calcification in
the apical
dental and posterior longitudinal ligaments at the
craniocervical junction, which account for abnormal appearance
on concurrent CT.

-CT CHEST [**2163-7-22**]
FINDINGS: Heart is moderately enlarged, and note is made of
prominent three- vessel coronary artery calcifications. There is
extensive calcified
atherosclerotic plaque seen in the aortic arch, and descending
aorta, which is noted to be mildly tortuous. There is no sign of
aneurysm or dilatation. Heavily calcified right thyroid nodule
is also noted, and calcified right upper paratracheal lymph node
is also seen. Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes measure up to 8
mm in size. The central bronchi are patent to the subsegmental
level, with prominent calcification of the tracheobronchial
tree. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is a small right pleural effusion. There is a trace amount
of left
pleural fluid. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. No focal
consolidation is seen. Incidental 3-mm right upper lobe nodule
(3, 21) is
noted. Displaced right clavicular fracture, with small
overriding fragment is noted. Additionally, there is fracture of
the right second rib in two places, both anteriorly, and
laterally. Lateral component is not displaced, but anterior
component is displaced approximately one-half shaft width, and
there is small surrounding subpleural hematoma, which is
localized. Minimally displaced fracture of the right third rib
is also seen anteriorly. Equivocal right fourth rib fracture is
seen. No other rib fractures are seen. There is no osseous
lesion suspicious for malignancy. DISH changes are seen in the
thoracic spine, with smooth flowing syndesmophytes, and
calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right second and third rib fractures. Right second rib is
fractured in
two places, and anterior component is slightly displaced, with
small localized subpleural hematoma.
2. Displaced right clavicle fracture.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Cardiomegaly, with prominent three-vessel coronary artery
calcification.
5. Incidentally detected 3-mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.

absence of known malignanc
