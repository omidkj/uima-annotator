Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
Found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Central venous catheter placement
Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
80 yo female with hx of recurrent falls, orthostatic
hypotension, and bipolar disorder who presents after being found
down.  Pt lives alone, is independent in all ADLS, and was last
seen 3 days prior to presentation. She normally attends church
daily and after she was not seen in church for 3 days, a friend
went to her house to check on her. The patient was found down on
the floor amongst fallen chairs. She was hypothermic to 30.0 and
hypotensive to SBP 70's. In the ED she was unresponsive with
hypothermia to 30.0 with SBP 80's Head CT was negative for
hemorrhage but CXR revealed asymmetric airspace disease
consistent with edema or atypical infection. Due to concern for
pneumosepsis she was given clindamycin, ceftazadime and
levofloxacin. Attempt was made to place at rt SC precept
catheter with arteriolar blood obtained with finder needle x2 so
sterile femoral line was placed. Upon warming her SBP dropped to
70's and she was started on norepinephrine and received a total
of 5L NS. During the placement of her central line she also
became more hypoxic and there was concern for hemothorax or
pneumothorax with the difficult line placement although f/u
chest XR did not reveal sign of either. Labs revealed positive
CE with no ECG changes so heparin gtt was started for NSTEMI
hesitantly due to subclavian arteriolar punctures. She was then
transferred intubated, sedated and on vasopressors to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for further management.

Trauma series: no evidence of fracture

CXR: bilateral hazy infiltrates c/w aspiration

Head CT: no bleed

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo female with hx of recurrent falls, orthostatic hypotension
who presented after being found down.

## Severe sepsis: Had hypotension, hypothermia and presumed
infection on admission. Most likely infectious source was
pulmonary with bilateral infiltrates on CXR. Given that pt has
hx of falls and was found down must consider aspiration PNA. UA
neg for infection. Abdomen is nontender to suspect
intraabdominal source.  Pt now on vasopressin and norepinephrine
to maintain MAPs >65. After discussion with family yesterday,
decision was made to make pt DNR/DNI and after extubation, pt
became hypotensive with labored breathing, at which time family
decided to make the patient CMO. She was started on a morphine
drip and given scopolamine patch for secretions and lorazepam
prn for agitation.

## Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to SIRS/Sepsis if
convinced has pneumonia. Early on had PaO2/FiO2 concerning for
ARDS. Family decided to withdraw respiratoy support, and pt was
made CMO

## Anemia: no evidence of bleed on pan-CT. On admission, was
volume contracted, so Hct did not accurately reflect red cell
mass. Recived 1 unit PRBCs.

## Thrombocytopenia: unknown cause. [**Month (only) 116**] be bone marrow process,
as she was mildly thrombocytopenic in [**2139**] as well. No concern
for DIC as fibrinogen and FDP within normal limits.

## Hepatitis: Likely secondary to volume depletion and
SIRS/Sepsis. Trended down now with improved volume status and
blood pressure support.

## Troponin/CKMB leak: Likely secondary to volume depletion and
hypotension as we don't know how long she was down. Possible,
but unlikely, that initial event was myocardial infarction
leading to fall. Enzymes trended down. Received aspirin and
heparin until care was withdrawn.

## ARF: Likely secondary to hypotension/volume depletion. Less
likely from rhabdomyolysis given that urine had only trace
blood. Made better urine with volume repletion and vasopressor
support. Creatinine, BUN improved prior to withdrawal of care.
