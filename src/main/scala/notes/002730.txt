Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old male with
multiple medical problems including tracheobronchial malacia
status post tracheoplasty in [**2108-5-29**] and then status
post tracheostomy on [**2108-12-18**] complicated by
aspiration and pulmonary problems most likely due to his non-
surgical neurologic issues. His last pneumonia was two weeks
ago. He has no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath,
but has been complaining of persistent abdominal pain with
nausea requiring Compazine and occasional extreme pain
requiring morphine sulfate, no fevers, chills, nausea or
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or other stool changes.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for COPD, asthma,
aspiration pneumonia, coronary artery disease status post
distant MI, diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy,
tracheobronchial malacia, hypertension, increased
cholesterol, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS:  He takes Compazine, morphine sulfate, insulin,
aspirin, Lipitor, Atrovent, simethicone, guaifenesin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 98.4
degrees, heart rate 94, blood pressure 102/56, respiratory
rate 18, 100 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen. The
trach is noted to be in place with a Passy-Muir valve. Neck
is supple. Heart rate was in regular rate and rhythm.
Bilaterally, there were rales with a few scattered wheezes.
Abdomen was nondistended with a G-tube in place with some
signs of tympany. Abdomen revealed well healed incision
sites.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, at this time, the patient was
admitted for further evaluation and treatment at [**Hospital1 346**]. He was to be preoperatively
prepared for a [**Hospital1 **] fundoplication and colostomy take-down.
The patient was appropriately preoperatively prepared with a
GoLYTYELY prep. He was given intravenous antibiotics. Beta
blockers were given and an EKG was performed which showed no
significant changes as well as a chest x-ray which also
showed no significant changes. The patient was typed and
screened and consent was signed for the procedure. On [**2109-3-7**], the patient proceeded to the Operating Room without
incident and underwent the following procedure. An
exploratory laparotomy was performed with lysis of adhesions.
An open [**Year (4 digits) **] fundoplication was performed. A colocolostomy
was performed times two and a colostomy take-down as well.
The patient received general anesthesia and also received an
epidural at this time. The patient received 2 units of packed
red blood cells in the Operating Room and a 14-French
jejunostomy tube was also placed during this time for feeding
purposes in the background of his recurrent aspiration. The
patient was brought to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit shortly
thereafter and was noted to be hypotensive at this time with
blood pressures into the 80s/40s. This was noted likely to be
secondary to epidural that was bolused in the Operating Room.
He received Neo-Synephrine in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit
and was given albuterol nebulizer treatments and when the
blood pressure rose appropriately, the Neo-Synephrine drip
was stopped and esmolol was given to control tachycardia. A
chest x-ray was done which showed no evidence of pneumothorax
at this time. Also, of note, the patient's temperature was to
103 degrees F. The patient remained on the ventilator during
this time as he was retaining some carbon dioxide still.
Also, at this time, a central venous line had been placed and
this was checked for position on chest x-ray and adjusted
appropriately. The patient was brought to the Trauma
Intensive Care Unit at this time and received 3 liters of IV
fluids bolused and was started on a Dilaudid patient
controlled analgesia device. Also, at this time, the epidural
was stopped. On postoperative day #2, the patient was again
noted to be febrile. However, he was able to be weaned to a
tracheostomy mask and he was also started on a clear diet at
this time without difficulty. He was also started on TPN at
this time. Also of note, the patient was continually followed
by Acute Pain Service during is inpatient stay who made
frequent recommendations in regards to his care and on
postoperative day #4, the patient was able to be sent to the
floor from the Intensive Care Unit. He did complain at this
time of brief chest tightness that was nonradiating without
diaphoresis or shortness of breath. An EKG was done that was
normal. Nitroglycerin was given sublingually one time with
some improvement. Enzymes were ordered to be cycled. They
were all found to be negative and to show no significant rise
that would be indicative of myocardial damage. The patient
continued to progress on the floor. The patient was also
followed by Thoracic Service during his time as an inpatient
as the patient was familiar to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**]. The patient was
then seen by Physical Therapy on postoperative day #4 to
improve his activity. The patient at times was recalcitrant
to instructions to getting out of bed. Attitude was described
as lack luster. However, this began to improve during his
hospital stay as he slowly increased his activity with the
encouragement of the Surgical Team and the physical
therapists. The patient was also placed on antibiotics
levofloxacin, cephazolin and vancomycin on [**3-12**],
postoperative day #5, for a culture that came back growing
Pseudomonas. On [**3-15**], postoperative day #8, a VAC
dressing was started on his midline abdominal wound. This
required only a very small strip of VAC sponge. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. Also of note during his stay on
postoperative day #12, the patient was seen again by the
Acute Pain Service that suggested an increase of methadone to
10 mg p.o. t.i.d., start Topamax 25 mg p.o. q.h.s., for
neuropathic pain, to continue Tylenol, to start ibuprofen 400
mg q.6h. and to continue Dilaudid 4 mg p.o. q.4h. as needed
for pain. These recommendations were followed. The case was
discussed again at length with the Acute Pain Service and the
VAC dressing was replaced again on the day of discharged,
[**2109-3-20**], by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and the appropriate paperwork
was completed for discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility and to receive aggressive physical
therapy and to receive VAC dressing changes every three days.
The patient is to continue to receive tube feeds as he has
been while in the hospital. These instructions are to
accompany the rest of his paperwork.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
asthma, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes
mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, recurrent pneumonia, tracheobronchial malacia,
tracheoplasty, tracheostomy, colostomy, Clostridium
difficile, methicillin-resistant staph aureus.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**] in [**12-30**] weeks at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 52342**]. The patient is to follow
