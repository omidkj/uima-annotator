Chief Complaint:
Severe chest pain

[**2169-11-26**] Replacement of Ascending Aorta and Hemiarch and Aortic
Valve Resuspension


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33019**] is a 60 year old male who developed sudden onset
chest pain which radiated to his neck and jaw. He was found to
be hypotensive and grey while at home. En route to another
hospital he was given intravenous fluids and found to have
significant blood pressure difference between his two arms. A
chest CTA revealed a Type A aortic dissection with extension
into the right subclavian artery and occlusion of the right
common carotid artery. There was no extension into the abdominal
aorta. Given the above findings, he was emergently transferred
to the [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical intervention.

Pertinent Results:
[**2169-11-26**] Intraop TEE:
Pre Bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. A mobile density is seen in the
ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta that is
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. It arises at
the level of the sino-tubular junction. It continues for
approximately 10 cm beyond the left subclavian. There is no
pericardial collection. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.

Post Bypass:
Left and right ventricular function is preserved. An aortic
graft is in place. There is mild aortic regurgitation. The
descending aortic dissection is unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33019**] was emergently brought to the operating room where
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] performed an aortic dissection repair. For surgical
details, please see seperate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. He was initially maintained on intravenous Nitro to
maintain MAP less than 85mmHg and SBP in the 100-120mmHg. On
postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He required several units of PRBC to
help maintain a hematocrit near 30%.

Over several days, he gradually weaned from intravenous Nitro
and was transitioned to beta blockade. He maintained stable
hemodynamics and eventually was transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day three. He remained stable with good BP control
on oral agents.  A CTA was done to assess his repair and any
residual aortic pathology.  He was ambulating and neurologically
intact.  He continued to be in and out of atrial fibrillation so
he was discharged on amiodarone and low dose coumadin.

He passed physical therapy on post-op day 8 and was cleared to
be discharged to rehab.
