History of Present Illness:
HPI: 50 y/o M w/ HCC +HCV cirrhosis s/p OLT [**5-/2148**], w/ recurrent
HCV infection and cirrhosis decompensated w/ ascites and PSE,
listed for 2nd transplant, who presents from home for evaluation
of hyponatremia. Per patient (who is a questionable historian),
he saw his hepatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in clinic today and had
routine labs drawn. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] called him at home and asked him
to present to the hospital as he was found to be hyponatremic.
.
Pt says that he has generally been feeling weak over the past
three months (since he was last hospitalized.) He reports taking
all medications as directed. He may have increased sodium intake
recently at a family party as he reports cheese and crackers
while at the beach over the weekend. He reports having
intermittent, diffuse abdominal pain since his lymph node
resection/ ex-lap/ appendectomy which was complicated by wound
infection. This is relieved by the oxycodone he is taking at
home. He also reports one episode of non-bloody emesis this
morning. Denies current nausea, sick contacts, recent illness.
.
ROS:
+ As per HPI, +weight loss, +weakness, +abdominal pain,
+diarrhea (on lactulose)
- No fevers, chills. No headache, visual changes, seizures. No
sinus tenderness, no sore throat. No chest pain, shortness of
breath, palpitations, orthopnea, cough, increased sputum

MICRO:

Peritoneal fluid Cx ([**2153-9-6**]: no growth
Urine Cx ([**2153-9-5**]): no growth
.
IMAGING:
Abdominal XR ([**2153-9-4**]): Nasogastric tube with tip in the
proximal duodenum (first or second portion). Nonspecific bowel
gas pattern without concern for ileus or obstruction. Probable
ascites.
.
Portable CXR ([**2153-9-3**]): 1) New large left pleural effusion and
left basilar opacity, could reflect infection with parapneumonic
effusion and/or compressive atelectasis. 2) Probable small right
pleural effusion and right basilar consolidation. 3) Mild volume
overload.

[**9-11**] CT TORSO: 1. Worsening adenopathy throughout the abdomen,
most heavily concentrated in the periaortic region. There are
also enlarged lymph nodes in the paratracheal, pericardial, and
epicardial regions. This diffuse lymphadenopathy has increased
since the comparison CT from [**2153-2-5**], and is concerning
for progression of the known lymphomatous process. Occlusion of
the IVC between the confluence of the iliac veins and the left
renal vein, likely secondary to extrinsic compression by the
periaortic collection of enlarged lymph nodes. Bilateral pleural
effusions, greater on the left, with complete collapse of the
left lower lobe and partial collapse of the right lower lobe.
Diffuse thickening of the ascending colon suspicious for
involvement by the lymphomatous process.

[**9-11**] CT Head: No evidence of bleeding infarct, mass or mass
effect.

[**9-18**] TTE: The left ventricle is not well seen. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve
leaflets are grossly structurally normal. Aortic valve was not
well seen. Valvular regurgitation was not adequately assessed.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo man with HCV and EtOH cirrhosis s/p OLT ([**2148**]), c/b
ascites who presented with worsening hyponatremia. Brief
hospital course by problem:
.
# Hyponatremia: Pt was admitted with asymptomatic hyponatremia
to 122 found on routine labs. As per his urine studies, this was
likely secondary to his cirrhosis-related intravascular volume
depletion. He was initiated on a trial of Tolvaptan 15mg, which
was discontinued due to a rise in his creatinine. The pt is
currently being fluid restricted to 1500ml water/day.
.
# Renal Failure: Admission creatinine was 1.3, however creat
began to rise while on tolvaptan and later while being fluid
restricted. Urine studies were suggestive of a prerenal
etiology, likely secondary to hepatorenal syndrome. The pt was
started on midodrine and octreotide, with daily albumin.
Tacrolimus was discontinued due to its potential nephrotoxic
effects. Urine output gradually decreased and the pt became less
alert, likely due to uremia, therefore HD was initiated on [**8-7**].
After 2 weeks of dialysis, the pt was also listed for kidney
transplant in addition to liver transplant.
.
# HCV/ETOH Cirrhosis S/P OLT: Tacrolimus was discontinued due to
its potential nephrotoxicity, however cellcept was continued,
along with bactrim prophylaxis, lactulose, and rifaximin. The pt
is currently listed for both liver and kidney transplant.
.
# Pneumonia: The pt's WBC increased on [**9-3**] and a CXR was
suggestive of pneumonia. Vancomycin and cefepime was started for
HAP.
.
# Abdominal pain: Pt has has intermittent abdominal pain
throughout this admission. Several KUBs have shown a dilated
transverse colon but no mechanical obstruction. Abdominal pain
is likely secondary to gas as well as ascites. The pain has been
moderately controlled with simethicone, occasional paracentesis,
and HD.
.
# Tachycardia: The patient has a chronic sinus tachycardia. EKG
is w/o evidence of right heart strain to suggest PE. It is felt
to be due to fluid shifts in the setting of frequent HD and
[**Doctor First Name 4397**].
.
# Anemia: Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's HCT was
variable, dropping and rising from day to day. On several
occasions, the patient underwent severe or sustained drops,
necessitating pRBC transfusions. During these instances, there
was no clear source of acute bleed (no melena, hematochezia,
blood paracen
