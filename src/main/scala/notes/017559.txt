Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lipitor / Augmentin / Golytely

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, tachypnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of MI one year
ago and placement of a biventricular IC device who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] earlier today with acute dysnea and tachypnea.
At [**Hospital1 **], the patient was seen to have bilateral pulmonary
edema and was started on levofloxacin and a nitroglycerin drip.
Cardiology at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted, and the patient was
transferred for further work-up after he required intubation at
[**Hospital3 **].
.
In the ED, Cardiology was again consulted on arrival of patient.
Again, inferior Q waves seen and a new right bundle branch block
and T waves in anterior leads. Overall, however, they felt that
the patient's clinical picture was more consistent with sepsis
than with acute coronary syndrome. The patient's antibiotics
were expanded from levofloxacin to vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
flagyl. In addition to possible pneumonia, the patient's
urinalysis was suggestive of infection. The patient's blood
pressures were in the 90s SBP, so his nitro gtt was
discontinued. Because his blood pressure did not recover, the
patient was given a right IJ and started on norepinephrine.
Before transfer to the MICU, the patient was sent for a CTPA,
given concern for pulmonary embolism.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated and sedated.

Microbiology:
Rapid respiratory virus screen and culture [**2173-3-1**]: POSITIVE FOR
PARAINFLUENZA TYPE 3
.
Imaging:
.
CTA chest [**2173-2-26**]:
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia with a small parapneumonic
effusion.
2. Complete collapse of the left lower lobe and moderate left
pleural effusion. While the left lower lobe collapse may be due
to mucoid mpaction, the presence of mediastinal and hilar
lymphadenopathy raises suspicion for an endobronchial or hilar
lesion. However, this is difficult to assess at this point since
the patient's lymphadenopathy may be reactive and due to
pneumonia. As a result, a dedicated Chest CT with contrast is
recommended after resolution of pneumonia for further
characterization. Furthermore, consultation with pulmonology is
recommended as the presence of an endobronchial lesion needs to
be excluded.
3. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic injury.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M with CAD s/p MI and CABG, CHF (EF 15%), BiV ICD,
initially admitted to the MICU with pneumonia, complicated by
septic shock. The patient was treated with antibiotics, with
resolution of his respiratory failure and septic physiology.
Antibiotics were narrowed to just levofloxacin, and the patient
was discharged with a plan for a total 8-day course.
.
# Community-acquired pneumonia, complicated by septic shock and
respiratory failure: The patiented presented with shortness of
breath. He developed respiratory failure and hypotension,
requiring intubation and norepinephrine gtt. Chest imaging
showed right lower lobe pneumonia and complete collapse of the
left lower lobe. The patient was treated with vancomycin,
cefepime, levofloxacin, with improvement in his hemodynamics and
respiratory status. Cultures were notable only for
parainfluenza. Cefepime was stopped on [**3-1**]. Vancomycin was
stopped on [**3-2**]. The patient was discharged on [**3-3**], with a plan
to treat with levofloxacin until [**3-7**].
.
# Respiratory failure: This was felt to be multifactorial, with
pneumonia, sepsis, pleural effusion, and pulmonary edema all
contributed. The patient was intubated for several days before
being extubated on [**2-28**]. Over the next several days, he was
weaned off of supplemental oxygen and discharged on room air.
.
# Septic shock: The patient developed hypotension, requiring
norepinephrine gtt. He blood pressure eventually stabilized, and
he was transitioned out of the ICU.
.
# Left lower lobar collapse: CTA showd left lower lobar collapse
and mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, concerning for an
endobronchial or hilar lesion. Repeat chest CT following
resolution of the pneumonia, and pulmonary consultation were
recommended. The inpatient team spoke with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 4120**] the need to follow up on this
finding. The possibility of a tumor and the need for prompt
follow-up was also discussed with the patient.
.
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy, with chronic systolic heart failure:
EF is 15-20%. Initially there was concern for pulmonary edema,
and the patient was started on a nitroglycerin gtt.
Subsequently, the patient became hypotensive, at which point
nitroglycerin was stopped, fluids were given, and the patient
was started on a norepinephrine gtt. As the patient improved, he
was diuresed. Carvedilol was restarted and lisinopril was added.
The patient was discharged with close cardiology and primary
care follow-up.
.
# CAD s/p CABG: MI was ruled out with serial enzymes. Aspirin
was continued.
.
# History of atrial fibrillation: The patient remained in sinus
rhythm. His cardiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to disc
