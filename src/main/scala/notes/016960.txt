Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially admited to receive 7+3 chemotherapy on [**6-17**] on
protocal. HLA typing was started. On day 13 bone marrow biopsy
shoed no evidence of leukemia. Subsequently started on GM-CSF on
protocal.

THen, she spiked on [**6-28**], ceftazidime and vancomycin was
started. On [**6-29**] she developed right sided throat/neck pain.
Exam consistent with right tonsillar erythema and asymetric
right sided swelling. Clindamycin was added for mouth anaerobes
and started ambisome as well. Neck CT with soft tissue swelling,
no  obvious abscess or fluid collection thru dental work
artifact, so cant rule out completely. Repeat neck CT on [**7-1**]
was normal. Clindamycin was changed to flagyl.
Chest CT ([**6-29**]) showed 2 ill-defined nodules RUL, consistent
with aspergillus so upped dose ambisome to 5mg/kg. Repeat CT
with 1 nodule increased in size, so changed ambisome to
voriconazole.

Pt received wedge resection of the nodule. The path showed
organizing penumonitis with fibrosis with no stainable organism.
THe patient was continued on
synercid/ambisome/voriconazole/flagy/cipro for neutropenic
coverage. Synercid was subsequently stopped, b/c pt finished
course of treatment for VRE in urine culture. Vanco started in
place to broaden Gram + coverage. Diffuse macularpapular body
rash (?aztreoname or ceftazidime?) continue to resolve.
Continued issue with slow to heal and drainage from wedge
resection site. Pain continued to require PCA fentanyl.
[**Date range (1) 11734**]. WEdge resection site healed and pain (wedge
resection/mucositis) improved. Mucositis has improved. Pain
control switch to oxycodone prn.

Patient continued from [**Date range (1) 41898**] with low grade temp 99-100.6
with no obvious etiology. Drug fever is suspected and
ambisome/flagyl was initially d/c. Fever continued at a lower
temp 99-100. Vanco/Cipro was d/c. Fever continued. CT ([**7-15**])
showed R pleural effusion with some loculation, but no
pneumonia. Per discussion with the ID consult, the loculation
does not appear complex or septated or non-homogenous. Decision
was made to hold off on the Thoracentesis. (also, pt was on
broad spectrum antibiotic/antifungal prior to the appearance of
pleural effusion.)

([**7-19**]) THoracentesis was performed due to continued fever
100-101. Pleural Fluid was blood-tinged and slightly cloudy,
800cc drained. Pleural fluid c/w exudate (malignancy vs
infection; pH7.45, gluc 111, LDH 155, alb 2.1 (serum 3.0), 250
WBC (18 poly, 21 lymph), 7500 RBC (10 mono). Pt spiked over nite
and cx and CXR taken. Vanco and levo started
([**7-20**]) 1 bottle of central line cx show gm +cocci and cluster
(along w/ hx of VRE in 1 urine in [**6-28**])->Vanco and levo d/c and
started back on Synercid 570 mcg q8.
([**7-20**]) BM show normal smear and flow cytometry was not done.
([**2118-7-21**]).Flagyl added due to concern of C diff (due to long hx
of abx, increased diarrhea and sudden increase of WBC over 1 day
from 11K to 23K). All other abx d/c. SHe HAS SINCE defervesed.
C. diff pending.
