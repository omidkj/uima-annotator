([**Hospital1 18**] [**2120-8-13**]) who presents with pleuritic and sharp chest
pain.
.
She reports that she had been doing well until last night. While
lying in bed, she developed sharp substernal chest pain, [**8-31**],
radiated to the Left shoulder, worse with inspiration. She felt
short of breath at that time. She took tramadol and small nitro
patch since she did not know where her pain was coming from. Her
pain partially improved. she could not sleep well overnight
given persistent pain.
She called her PCP and was [**Name9 (PRE) 8148**] to the emergency department.

Denied orthopnea, PND, cough, fevers, chills, URI symptoms, or
sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] urinary symtpoms either.
Patient recalls that this sympotms are very similar to her prior
presentation in [**Month (only) **].
.
As far as her cardiovascular status, she reports being able to
walk [**1-22**] blocks with no significant problems. She is able to go
up 1 flight of staris with no chest pain or SOB either. Per her
report, she had a clean cardiac cath early this year at [**Hospital1 112**]
prior to her knee surgery.
.
In the Ed, Vs 98.7, HR 96, 129/79, Rr 18, sats 99% on RA. A CtA
was done that r/o PE. However, it showed loculated pleural
effusion worse since last Ct. Levaquine 750xd1 was given.
Aspirin and tylenol were given.
.

CTA [**2121-1-16**]
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism or aortic process.
2. Recurrent left pleural effusion with evidence of loculation
and associated atelectasis, but no definite consolidation. This
finding is significantly worse since the [**2120-9-17**] CT (status post
removal of the pigtail drainage catheter) and should be
correlated with detailed clinical information. Although there is
a small right pleural effusion, there is no CT evidence of CHF.
3. Intra-abdominal findings, with very limited evaluation.

*****PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent left pleural effusion.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Chronic empyema.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old
woman who has suffered multiple recurrent left-sided empyemas
The last was in [**Month (only) 205**] and [**2120-8-21**]. She was treated with
pigtail drainage, TPA and antifungals for a candidal empyema.
She represented with acute chest pain and an elevated white
count. She was noted to have a loculated medial likely fluid
collection. This was not accessible via percutaneous
drainage.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was positioned supine and
through a double-lumen endotracheal tube flexible
bronchoscopy was performed to the  segmental airway level
bilaterally. There were no anatomic abnormalities. There was
no blood, plugging, purulence, or endobronchial tumor noted.

The patient was then turned into the left thoracotomy
position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
We started off thoracoscopically with a 15 mm port in
interspace 7 and the posterior axillary line. There were very
complete adhesions of the chest wall to the lung. We slowly
took these adhesions down bluntly and then were able to free
up enough space to put 2 more ports which we placed at
approximately interspace 6, one near the tip of the scapula
and the other anteriorly behind the pectoralis. We continued
this dissection to free up the lung and this took the better
course of approximately 2 hours. We eventually were able to
free up the anterior aspect of the lung and coming down into
the hilum just on the surface of the pericardium, we noted a
more solid appearing phlegmonous structure. The phrenic nerve
was right behind this as was the pericardium. I did not think
that we would be able to adequately dissect around this
inflamed/infected area without direct tactile feedback.
Therefore, I elected to perform a posterolateral thoracotomy
in which we divided the latissimus and spared the serratus.
We did shingle the sixth rib for more access. As we freed up
this medial abnormal soft tissue collection we realized that
there was no frank abscess with fluid within it but this was
a solid chronic phlegmonous process. We resected this and
sent it for microbiology. We also took some samples of some
fluid collection that we did encounter more superiorly above
the hilum in the region of the AP window. This we sent for
microbiology. We sent some of the pleural debris for
microbiology and pathology as well. As we came down to the
diaphragm, the lower lobe was densely adherent to the
diaphragm. We could feel a more necrotic and solid lesion
there. We slowly dissected this free and noted that there was
an old hematoma or necrotic cavity which was solid in nature.
This was at the base of the lung right on the diaphragm. We
debrided all this free and inspected the diaphragm. We did
not see any evidence of communication of the subdiaphragmatic
contents, i.e. stomach, to the pleural space. There were some
tears of the lung during the course of this decortication and
lysis of adhesions and we sewed some of the bigger air leaks
closed using 3-0 Vicryl. At the completion we irrigated
copiously with saline and then water. Hemostasis was
adequate. We inspected the thoracotomy and shingled rib site
and were happy with the hemostasis there as well. We placed 3
chest tubes; one anteriorly to the apex, one posteriorly to
the apex and one to the base and anchored these with 0
Prolene. We inflated the lung and it filled the chest space
well. We then closed the thoracotomy with #1 Vicryl. Then we
reapproximated the serratus to the chest wall using 0-Vicryl,
reapproximated the latissimus with 0-Vicryl, the subcutaneous
tissue with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl. At the
complet
