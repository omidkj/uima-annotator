Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5547**]
Chief Complaint:
large cystic mass within the abdomen resulting in abdominal
bloating

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Radical resection of cystic intra-abdominal mass en bloc
    with left hepatic lobe and gallbladder.
3. Intraoperative cholangiogram.
4. [**First Name3 (LF) **]


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 3646**] is a 45-year-old female with a history of
progressive abdominal bloating and discomfort. An abdominal
ultrasound on [**2-5**] showed a
large cystic mass within the abdomen. This was confirmed with
a CT scan of the abdomen obtained on [**2-8**]. This
demonstrated a large complex septated mass centered within
the right abdomen and inseparable from the left hemi liver.
The lesion measured up to 32 cm in maximum size and was
uniform in its attenuation. The findings were most consistent
with either a biliary cystadenoma, a mesenteric or peritoneal
cyst or a rare sarcoma. The imaging findings and her history
were not consistent with hydatid cyst disease. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] did
not feel
that further imaging or a preoperative biopsy would be
helpful in the management of this lesion and so advised up-
front surgery as well as an intraoperative frozen section
biopsy of the mass. She understood the rationale for this
plan of care as well as the risks and benefits of the
procedure and consented to proceed.


Past Medical History:
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Asthma.
2. Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy as well as status
post ureteroscopy and stone removal in [**2184**].
3. Cellulitis of the left leg x2.
Past Surgical History:
1. Status post C-sections x2.
2. Status post tonsillectomy at the age 19.
3. Status post a liver biopsy by needle for a small cyst
approximately six years ago. The results of this were apparently

a benign cyst and she was told that she needed no further
followup.


Social History:
The patient is married and accompanied to the
visit today by her husband.  She has two children aged 19 and
21.
She has a trivial smoking history, having quit several weeks
ago.
She lives in [**Location 9101**] and works as an administrative manager of a
health care agency.  She also works part time as a waitress. She
drinks approximately two alcoholic beverages each week.


Family History:
Remarkable for a mother who is alive and well
after treatment for breast cancer.  Her father is alive and well
with prostate cancer.  He also is a survivor of esophageal and
stomach cancer.  A maternal aunt died of melanoma and a maternal
grandmother died of pancreatic cancer.  A maternal grandfather
died of bone cancer.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2189-2-23**] 6:06 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post left hepatectomy with associated postoperative
changes. JP
drain terminates near the surgical resection site adjacent to
segment VIII.
2. Small air-fluid collection within segment V of the liver.
This appearance could be consistent with surgical packing
material. Correlation with surgical history advised.
3. Small fluid-attenuation collection with a mildly enhancing
rim posterior to the gastric antrum may represent postoperative
fluid collection or early phlegmon.
4. Mild prominence of the right-sided biliary system. Lack of
complete
visualization of the CBD which may be related to postoperative
inflammatory change. Evidence of intra-abdominal and pelvic free
fluid.
5. Pathologically enlarged porta hepatis lymph node, as above,
likely
reactive.
6. A small amount of free intra-abdominal air consistent with
recent surgical history.
7. Left renal hypodense lesion, too small to characterize,
likely
representing a simple cyst.
8. Right hepatic 7-mm lesion, too small to characterize, likely
representing a simple cyst.
9. Probable uterine fibroid. This could be confirmed by pelvic
ultrasound on a non-emergent basis, as clinically indicated.

[**Date Range **] [**2189-2-24**]
Impression: Normal major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique .A mild diffuse
dilation was seen at the main duct, right main hepatic duct,
left main hepatic duct stump and right intrahepatic biliary
branches with the CBD measuring 10mm in diameter . Mild
extravasation of contrast was noted at the left main hepatic
duct stump A 7cm by 10FR Cotton [**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed
successfully using a [**Company 2267**] Rx 10 Fr stent introducer
kit

Cytology Report CYST FLUID Procedure Date of [**2189-2-19**]
 Diagnosis: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
  Blood and macrophages consistent with hemorrhagic cyst
  contents. No epithelial cells present.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 33902**] operative course was complicated by increased blood
loss due to extensive involvement of cyst-like mass within
liver. EBL estimated at about 1800cc. She was transfused with 2
units of PRBC, and transferred for closer monitoring. Her
vitals, and clinical presentation were otherwise stable.
Epidural was initially placed for pain control, but discontinued
due to intra-operative blood loss. Patient was managed on a PCA.
Serial Hct's were monitored. HCT's stable. No other signs of
post-op bleeding noted. She was transferred to Stone 5 for post
op care.
.
Her diet was advanced slowly. RLQ JP drain with bilious ouput.
Bilirubin present in fluid. [**Doctor Last Name **] arranged for concern for
post-op biliary leak. IV Anitbiotics started. Stent placed.
Biliary leak stabilized. Diet advanced slowly once again
post-[**Doctor Last Name **]. Amylase and Lipase elevated related to [**Doctor Last Name **]. Labwork
re-checked. Both Amylase, Lipase, and WBC decreased. HCT stable.
Antibiotics discontinued. Tolerating a regular diet. No N/V.
.
Post-op recovery otherwise stable. Ambulating independently.
Foley removed. Urinating adequates amounts. Passing flatus. Pain
