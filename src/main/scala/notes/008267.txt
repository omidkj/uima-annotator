Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Nafcillin Sodium

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, chills, neck stiffness, and right-sided paraesthesias

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TEE
Intubation
Angiogram ([**2149-1-31**])

History of Present Illness:
52 y.o. M with history of recurrent MSSA epidural abscesses,
mitral valve endocarditis s/p valvular repair, and osteomyelitis
who presented on [**1-20**] with fever, chills, neck stiffness and
right-sided parethesias after a mechanical fall.
.
The patient was previously admitted from [**Date range (3) 77471**] with an
epidural abscess. During that admission he was treated for MSSA
bactermia, complicated by epidural abcesses of the cervical,
lumbar and thoracic spine, along with septic arthritis of right
elbow and osteo of foot (foot osteo also + for
pseudomonas)thought to be intial portal of MSSA entry. During
that hospitalization, he required multiple operative
interventions by the orthopedic and podiatry services and was
treated with cefepime. That hospitalization was also complicated
by flail mitral cusp and worsening mitral regurgitation
resulting in a MV annuloplasty. Also with acute renal failure
requiring CVVH through [**2148-4-26**].
.
Readmitted from [**Date range (3) 77472**] with new afib and syncope; he
was started on coumadin at this time though both have since been
stopped. Again admitted [**Date range (3) 77473**] with MSSA
bacteremia/paraspinal abscess. He underwent debridement of the
lumbosacral spine, excision and debridement of the abscess of
the deep lumbar L4-L5, L5-S1 and was treated with cefazolin.
Antibiotics were completed on [**2148-10-14**].
.
The patient reports that, since [**2148-7-26**], he has been working
with PT and has increased strength. He has continued to have LBP
and, last month, was started on a fentanyl patch by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
did not tolerate this (nausea, "fogginess") and stopped taking
it the week prior to this presentation.
.
Approximately 10 days prior to discharge he was walking up 3
stairs and fell onto his buttocks. Since that time, he has had
significantly worsened back pain.
.
Two days prior to arrival he began to have chills and shakes
(?rigors as well) with a temperature up to 101. Also with
decreased appetite. One day prior to admission, he began to have
neck pain and stiffness (worse than baseline) and had trouble
sleeping. He took three oxycodone. He continued to have chills
and called his PCP on the day of admission. Was seen in the
office and referred to the ED.
.
In the ED, T 98.3 (up to 101.3), BP 102/57, HR 82, RR 18 and 99%
on room air. He was given ceftriaxone 2g, vancomycin 1g,
morphine and zofran. An MRI of the C/T/L spine was done which
showed multilevel abscesses, discitis with osteomyelitis, and
cervical disc protrusion. An LP was not attempted given the
extensiveness of findings on MR.
.
The patient was admitted to medicine for further management of
his pain and the above findings on MRI.

MR C/T/L-SPINE W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2149-1-20**] 4:15 PM
CERVICAL:

The cord demonstrates normal signal intensity. Alignment is
normal. The bone
marrow signal intensity is unremarkable.

C2/C3: There is a mild posterior disc bulge with thickening of
the posterior
longitudinal ligament causing deformity of the ventral thecal
sac and mild
central canal narrowing as well as minimal flattening of the
ventral aspect of
the cord. There is no significant neural foraminal narrowing.

C3/C4: There is a large left paracentral disc protrusion with
components
migrating predominantly superior as well as a smaller component
migrating
inferiorly causing moderate-to-severe central canal narrowing at
this level
and flattening of the anterior left lateral aspect of the cord
and
displacement to the right. This associated with bilateral, left
greater than
right uncovertebral joint degenerative changes causes severe
left neural
foraminal and severe left subarticular narrowing and no right
subarticular
narrowing or neural foraminal stenosis. There is likely
encroachment on the
exiting C3 nerve root. No definite cord edema is observed at
this level.

C4/C5: Disc osteophyte complex is noted with bilateral right
greater than
left foraminal components causing moderate-to-severe right and
mild-to-
moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. There is mild central
canal
narrowing at this level with associated flattening of the right
anterolateral
aspect of the cord.

C5/C6: There is a minimal disc bulge and associated
uncovertebral joint
degenerative changes, more on the left than on the right causing
moderate-to-
severe left and mild-to-moderate right neural foraminal
narrowing.

C6-C7: Unremarkable. There is no evidence for posterior disc
bulge, central
canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
