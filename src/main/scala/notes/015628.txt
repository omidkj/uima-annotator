Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5755**]
Chief Complaint:
Biliary obstruction

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy and replacement of biliary stent

History of Present Illness:
This is a 80 year old man with past medical history significant
for biliary obstruction likely secondary to cholangiocarcinoma
status post biliary stent in [**3-5**] who was transferred from
[**Hospital 1474**] hospital where he presented with weakness and jaundice.
 Labs were remarkable for elevated LFTs, bili, and alkaline
phosphatase with a normal amylase and lipase.  Patient underwent
CT and MRCP at [**Hospital1 1474**], prior to transfer, which showed massive
dilation of the intrahepatics, stent in the common bile duct,
and gallstones in the gallbladder.  ERCP was attempted at
[**Hospital1 1474**] for further evaluation.  Note was made of a large
diverticulum in the second portion of the duodenum where the
ampulla was located.  The stent was noted to be exiting the
ampulla.  Stent removal and cholangiogram were attempted but
failed.  Patient was thus transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for continued
care and repeat attempt for stent removal and replacement.
.
ROS:
Pt states that prior to his procedure he felt weak and had not
eating in 2 days.  He denies abdominal pain, fevers, chills,
N/V, dysuria, cough/SOB, chest pain.

ERCP [**2131-6-28**]:
Findings:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: A plastic stent placed in the biliary duct was
found in the major papilla and impacting the internal wall of
the diverticulum. A single diverticulum with large opening was
found with the major papilla internally.
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in complete opacification. The procedure was not
difficult. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was not attempted.

Biliary Tree: A single irregular stricture of malignant
appearance that was 25mm long was seen at the middle third of
the common bile duct. There was severe post-obstructive
dilation. These findings are compatible with malignant biliary
stricture.
.
Procedures:
A plastic stent was removed for the bile duct using a rat tooth
forceps.
Given the malignant biliary obstruction (and need for metal
stenting) a sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Following sphincterotomy fresh bleeding was noted.
Given the presnce of acute sphincterotomy bleed the plan for
metal stenting was aborted due to poor duodenal visualisation
and a 5cm by 10F double pig tail biliary stent was placed
successfully in the common bile duct.
Following double pigtail stent placement 2 x 2cc 1/10,000
adrenaline injection was applied to the apex of the
sphincterotomy. Hemostasis appeared to be achieved although
there was a large overlying clot.
Cytology samples were obtained for histology using a brush in
the middle third of the common bile duct.

Recommendations:
Admit to hospital for overnight stay
NPO overnight , then advance diet as tolerated in AM.
Check Hct now and again in 6 hours
Await cytology and plan for metal stent placement in 1 month


Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old male with suspected cholangiocarcinoma transferred
from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital for obstructive jaundice for stent
change.
.
## Obstructive jaundice:
Patient admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] with complaints of weakness and
jaundic.  Bili and alk phos elevated from baseline with
associated elevation of his LFTs.  CT and MRCP confirmed severe
biliary dilation.  ERCP attempted at [**Hospital1 1474**] found stent
exiting the ampulla.  Patient underwent repeat ERCP here at
[**Hospital1 18**].  The stent was removed.  Attempt was made to place a
metal stent but due to bleeding following a small sphincterotomy
to facilitate the stent placement, visualization was impaired
and operators were forced to place a plastic stent.  Patient
will be contact[**Name (NI) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to arrange placement of a
metal stent for improved long term management within 1 month.
Brushings were obtained during ERCP for cytology given patient's
diagnosis remains undifferentiated.  CA [**43**]-9 has been noted to
be elevated in the past with a normal CEA.  Repeat CA [**43**]-9 was
sent at [**Hospital1 1474**] and was pending.  The patient was offerred
[**Hospital1 28085**] to oncology here but wishes to follow-up with his
regular primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28085**] to an oncologist within
their system.  Extensive discussions were held with the patient
to help him cope with his diagnosis of cancer.  He was seen by
both social work and palliative care and provided numbers to
schedule follow-up with them as needed.  On the day of
discharge, patient's bili and LFTs trending down.  He was
tolerating a regular diet without complaints.
.
## ICU course:
Immediately following ERCP, patient was noted to be unresponsive
with decreased respirations and O2 sats in the low 70's on
nonrebr
