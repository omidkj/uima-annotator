Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
admission for monitoring in the setting of a new PE and recent
left fronto-parietal SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC Filter Placement


History of Present Illness:
82M w/ MMP including a PE about one year ago and recent SDH who
presents today with a HA and found to have a PE. Today the
patient presents because of a 6/10 L sided HA. His vitals in the
ED were as follows: T 97, HR 60, BP 140/100, RR 12, O2 90% RA,
99% 2l. He reports that he had a the same HA during his last
admission. Slight movement of his head seems to trigger the
pain. Head CT done here showed that the hematoma was resolving.
A CT-A was obtained and showed a R lower lobe segmental PE. The
patient had an IVC filter placed. He was seen by neurosurg who
felt that it was safe to anti-coag him w/ a conservative heparin
scale.
.
On his last admission the patient's fall was thought to be
secondary to his central demyelinating disorder. Given the
complexities involved with his anti-coagulation today, the
patient was tx to the ICU for monitoring.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2119-2-10**] 7:54 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: Hypoxic, r/o infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old man with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Hypoxic, r/o infiltrate
INDICATIONS: 82-year-old man with hypoxia.

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: A dual lead ICD/pacer is in a similar
position. The right pacer lead, which is unchanged, is
unchanged. The cardiac and mediastinal contours are not
significantly changed. The lungs are clear. There are no pleural
effusions or pneumothorax.

There are opacities along the anterior thoracic spine which are
similar and again consistent with large osteophytes. There is
also calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for progression of SDH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old man with hx of subdural now w/worsening headache and
? new blood on outside CT head
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for progression of SDH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 82-year-old man with history of subdural, now with
worsening headache and question of new blood on outside CT.
Evaluate for progression of subdural hemorrhage.

Comparison is made to [**2119-2-4**].

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: Again seen is a small left-sided
subdural hematoma layering over the left temporoparietal
convexity. It again measures 9 mm in greatest transverse
dimension, with overall no significant size change. The density
is now mostly isointense to [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter, however, there is a
more focal area of hypoattenuation that suggests more acute
re-hemorrhage. Again seen is mild mass effect on the subjacent
gyri and lateral ventricle. There is no hydrocephalus.
Periventricular and deep white matter hypodensities reflect
small vessel angiopathy. The visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells remain clear and osseous and surrounding soft
tissue structures appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Stable size of left subdural hematoma. Small focus of high
attenuation, however, indicates probable recent re-hemorrhage.
Further clinical surveillance and possibly repeat scan is
recommended.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2119-2-10**] 7:44 PM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-

Reason: h/o PE now w/ hypoxia evaluate for PE
Field of view: 38 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old man with Dm, s/p pacemaker, hip replacement,
admitted s/p fall found to have subdural hematoma.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
h/o PE now w/ hypoxia evaluate for PE
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 82-year-old man status post fall with subdural
hematoma. History of PE, now with hypoxia. Assess for PE.

TECHNIQUE: CTA of the chest with and without contrast.
Multiplanar reformations were performed.

No prior CTA is available for comparison.

FINDINGS: There is a filling defect of a segmental pulmonary
artery in the right lower lobe. There is motion in the lower
chest precluding the definitive assessment of subsegmental
branches; however, there probably are several left lower lobe
subsegmental filling defects. The heart, pericardium, and great
vessels are unremarkable except for mild atherosclerotic
calcifications. There are several mediastinal lymph nodes which
do not meet size criteria for pathologic enlargement. Again seen
is an 8-mm noncalcified left upper lobe lung nodule, better
assessed on HRCT of [**2119-2-6**]. The lungs are otherwise
clear without consolidations or effusions. Images through the
upper abdomen do not demonstrate acute pathology.
Atherosclerotic calcifications of the celiac axis are noted.

BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are again seen along the
thoracic spine without evidence of suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe segmental PE.
2. 8-mm suspicious-appearing nodule in the left upper lobe,
better assessed on HRCT of [**2119-2-6**]. Dedicated chest CT
in three months' time is recommended as followup.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS

Reason: eval for dvt

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old man with h/o PE now w/ hypoxia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for dvt
INDICATION: 83-year-old man with history of PE, now with
hypoxia. Evaluate for DVT.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VEIN DOPPLER ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and
Doppler examination of bilateral common femoral, superficial
femoral and popliteal veins was performed. Normal
compressibility, augmentation, Doppler flow and waveforms are
demonstrated. There is no evidence of intraluminal clot.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2119-2-12**] 9:16 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Eval for interval change of SDH

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
82 year old man with hx of SDH, started on heparin for
anti-coagulation for PE
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Eval for interval change of SDH
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 82-year-old male with subdural hematoma on heparin for
anticoagulation for PE, referred for assessment of interval
change in subdural hematoma.

COMPARISON: [**2119-2-10**].

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is the small left-sided subdural
hematoma which layers over the left temp
