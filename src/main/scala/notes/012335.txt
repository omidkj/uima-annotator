Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure and intubated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
46 yo man with history of cervical spinal cord injury, s/p C3-6
ACDF and remaining quadriplegia, indwelling suprapubic
catheter/recurrent UTIs, baclofen pump, COPD, OSA who presented
to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with
subsequent unresponsiveness.
.
Per wife and pt. over the past 10 days, they noted several
episodes they thought were seizures.  These are described as
head turning to the right, facial grimacing, gutteral sounds,
lasting 1-2 mins at a time with subsequent impaired ability to
respond to her which resolved within 5-10 mins. He has had a
total of four events of similar nature, although on one
occasion, patient states that he actually recalled having these
symptoms.  She notes that on that occasion, patient was actually
yawning.  The night prior to evaluation, while going to sleep,
wife noted another episode similar to above, however this time,
after 2 mins of these events, patient did not return respond to
her at all. Wife noted that his eyes rolled backwards and this
was followed by tremmors of b/l UEs.  Wife also notes that ~ 1mo
ago he was admitted to [**Hospital **] Rehab, where multiple medication
changes were made, which she can not recall.
.
EMS arrived  and VS were 132/P, 88, RR 8, irregular, 2mm pupils
and was unresponsive.  Was placed on NRB, 1mg Narcan was given
and reported to be last seen at baseline 3hrs prior by wire.
After a few mins, was responsive to noxious stimuli. "No obvious
signs of seizure activity noted."
.
While at OSH ([**Hospital3 26615**]), initial VS were 96.6F 150/p 12 88
100% NRB and HR varied 80-140s.  He was noted to have pinpoint
pupils and given a total of 4 mg of Narcan without effect,
followed by intubation for airway protection in setting of
unresponsiveness to vocal or noxious stimuli purposefully, but
only with h/n movements.  CT head was negative for ICH, with nl
electrolytes, troponins, WBC of 7K and HCT of 46, INR 3.1, Ca
[**34**].8, Trop < 0.03, .  Utox was positive for opiates/methadone
(on methadone/vicod) and benzodiazepines (valium), UA postive
for Nitrites.  ECG was SR w/ Twf in III and IVCD.
.
On arrival to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], VS were "Afebrile," 65 20 106/66
100% on 450/16/40%/5.  Per neurology c/s, bedside EEG was
obtained (read pending) who were concerned re: sz from baclofen
toxicity.  Anesthesia interrogated the baclofen pump working
appropriately and also obtained history of intermittent
benzodiazepine use, gabapentin use. Patient's ECG was SR, CXR
w/o acute process.  Laboratory values were notable for ABG of
7.51/48/84/40, with Chem 7 notable for Cl 97 and HCO3 of 39 and
Na 142 with Cr 0.5.  WBC 10K w/ HCT of 46% and MCV of 103, PT
37.3, PTT: 65.7, INR: 3.6.  He received a 1g Vancomycin, and 1g
of CFTX.  Was maintained on midazolam gtt.
.
On transfer, VS were 65 108/65 24 100% on 450/16/40%/5 and is
intermittently responding to verbal commands (do you have
pain?).
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were wnl.  Patient opened
eyes and followed simple 2 step commands.
.
Per d/w Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], no recent changes to baclofen pump, 8wks
ago, increased by 15% w/o effect (~ 1000mcg daily), last month
also had a myelogram that showed normal function for the pump
but tone has increased significantly over the past [**1-23**] year.
.

Imaging:
EEG [**2136-5-16**]:  This is an abnormal EEG because of the presence of

infrequent epileptic discharges in the occipital regions as well
as
nearly continuous slowing in these regions. These findings are
indicative of potential bioccipital epileptogenic foci with
underlying
subcortical dysfunction. In addition, background showed diffuse
slowing
suggestive of a mild encephalopathy of non-specific etiology. No

electrographic seizures are present.
.
CXR [**2136-5-16**]:  Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates ET
tube terminating 2.5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is
positioned in the stomach. Low lung volumes. Retrocardiac
opacity obscures the left hemidiaphragm. Right lung base opacity
is also noted. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Hilar
and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable. Heart size is
normal.  There is no pulmonary edema. Partially imaged upper
abdomen is notable for air-filled prominent stomach and bowel
loops.
.
EEG [**2136-5-18**]:  This is an abnormal portable EEG, because of mild
diffuse
background slowing with intermittent bursts of further slowing
indicative of a mild diffuse encephalopathy of nonspecific
etiology. No
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are present.
Note is
made of a slower than average cardiac rate.
.
MR C spine with and without contrast [**2136-5-19**] (PRELIM REPORT!!!):

1. Diffuse cervical spinal cord atrophy with cystic myelomalacia
at C4-5 at the site of prior contusion. No abnormal enhancement
is seen.
2. Post-surgical changes from anterior cervical fusion and
instrumentation at C3-C5 levels and C3-C6 laminectomies.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine, most
prominent at C4-C5 and C5-C6 as described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo man with history of cervical spinal cord injury, s/p C3-6
ACDF and remaining quadriplegia, indwelling suprapubic
catheter/recurrent UTIs, baclofen pump, COPD, OSA who presented
to OSH with after his wife noted seizure like activity with
subsequent unresponsiveness, s/p 1 day intubation.  Admission
complicated by hypotension, bradycardia, hypoventillation.
.
# Hypotension, bradycardia, hypopnea:  Patient presented
hypotensive to SBP high 70-80 without reflex tachycardia (HRs as
low as 40s).  Hypotension was not responsive to extensive volume
challenge (given 7.5 L NS in 24 hours).  The etiology appears to
be a combination of increased vagal tone and medication effect.
The HR and BP responded to atropine challenge, indicating
increased vagal tone from some offending proces
