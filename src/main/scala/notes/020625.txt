was found down in her bathroom at some point in the afternoon.
She was brought to [**Hospital **] Hospital where she was intubated. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further mangament. Neurosurgery was

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-11-18**] 9:05 PM

INDICATION: Known intracranial hemorrhage from outside hospital.
Evaluate for progression of hemorrhage.

Comparison is made to hard copy head CT films from [**Hospital **]
Hospital of the same day.

NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is a large intraparenchymal
hemorrhage involving the left frontal, left temporal, and left
parietal lobes, in addition to the left basal ganglia.
Hemorrhage measures 6.0 x 4.9 cm in greatest axial dimensions.
There is approximately 1.3 cm of subfalcine herniation present.
The appearance is not significantly different from the head CT
from [**Hospital **] Hospital. The left lateral ventricle is
obliterated. There is hemorrhage within the right lateral
ventricle and within the third and fourth ventricles. There is
hypodensity of the white matter of the right and left cerebral
hemispheres, likely representing edema. There is a calcified
nodule adjacent to the left frontal calvarium, which may
represent a small meningioma. This measures 9 x 7 mm. The
osseous structures are otherwise unremarkable. The visualized
paranasal sinuses are clear.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged large intraparenchymal and
intraventricular hemorrhage, with 1.3 cm of subfalcine
herniation and with possible uncal herniation. The appearance
has not significantly changed from the CT of [**Hospital **] Hospital.
