Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 37 YOM with a PMH sig for hypertension, Chronic
renal insufficiency, type B aortic dissection, anxiety, and
medication noncompliance who presented because of three days of
worsening dyspnea with exertion. Of note, the patient was
recently hospitalized in [**Month (only) 359**] with hypertensive urgency
requiring ICU admission in the setting of medication
noncompliance.  He was discharged on labetalol 800 mg TID, but
patient self-decreased it
to labetalol 800 mg [**Hospital1 **] because of side effects of medications.
He normally does not take his medications regularly because he
forgets in the setting of significant life stresses. Three days
ago he noted worsening SOB after climbing a flight of stairs. He
also c/o sneezing, chills, head and chest congestion during this
time. He denies sick contacts, headache, chest pain, ear or
throat pain. This morning he woke up and felt so short of breath
and other symptoms had progressed that he presented to ED.

In the ED, patient was noted to be hypertensive to 251/163 and
HR 97.  He was SOB with RR 22 and O2 sat 100% RA.  CXR looked
like there was vascular congestion.  A bnp was elevated at 2790
which is slightly higher than his BNP when he presented in
[**Month (only) 359**] in hypertensive urgency/CHF where it was 2333.  His Cr
was 3.5 which is similar to his Cr at last discharge, but this
is higher than his baseline 2.5-3.0.  He was given labetalol 20
mg IV x 2, asa, combivent nebs.  His BP remained elevated so he
was started on nitro gtt for bp control.  BP was 179/106 after
uptitrtating nitro, with HR 90, satting 97% 2 L nc.

In the ICU, he was started on IV labetolol. On [**1-5**], he was
diruesed with IV Furosamide 40mg with good effect. His home HCTZ
and Amlodipin were restarted. He was then switch to PO
Furosemide and Spironolactone, started PO Labetalol at 400mg TID
(half home dose), weaned IV labetolol. In the PM SBP in the
170's increased PO labetolol to 800mg TID patient subsequently
became hypotensive to the 90's, Labetolol was reduced to 600mg
TID. He received IV furosamide 40mg at 15:00, put out 1200L
following but I/O balance remained positive, repeated IV
Furosamide 40mg at 20:00. Started Fluid restriction to 2L per
day. SW was consulted and discussed housing options. Requested
that week-day Social Worker see him and continue managment.
[**Month/Day (4) 7473**] (Renal consult) recommened re-starting home dose meds.
On [**2177-1-6**], Labetalol changed to 600mg PO TID and clonidine patch
was started. His 6pm Is/Os revealed -1.1 L. On [**2177-1-7**] at 6:30
