Imaging:
.
[**2118-10-6**] CXR:  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The
pulmonary
vascularity is increased with perihilar haziness, and there are
bilateral
pleural effusions. Calcifications of the aortic arch are
unchanged. The upper lungs are clear. There is diffuse
osteopenia. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with
mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure.
.
[**2118-10-7**] TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30 %) with inferior akinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2111-6-3**], there has been marked
deterioration of left ventricular contractile function and
marked increase in mitral and tricuspud valve regurgitation.
.
[**2118-10-7**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities.
.
[**2118-10-7**] CT chest:
1. Allowing for respiratory motion, no large or central
pulmonary embolism is seen.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Small right greater than left pleural effusions with RLL
atelectasis/consolidation and LLL atelectasis.
4. Chronic emphysematous changes.
5. Mediastinal adenopathy. Clinical correlation is advised.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 87 year old female with history of coronary artery
disease and poor baseline EF who presented with dyspnea, with
work-up notable for evidence of volume overload by imaging,
elevated BNP, and echocardiogram revealing worsening MR.

# Respiratory distress:
Based on exam, laboratories, and imaging, and further supported
by her response to diuresis, it appeared that patient had an
acute congestive heart failure exacerbation. She reported a
progressive worsening of her breathing over 2 weeks with a cough
productive of white sputum. She has had no fevers or purlent
sputum, or leukocytosis to suggest a pneumonia.  Initial lactate
3.0, but trended downward to 1.8, which was felt to be related
to work of breathing (as opposed to sepsis or infection).
Patient received an additional 10 mg of lasix with her packed
red blood cells, and diuresed over two liters. She has been
weaned from 50% to 4L NC this morning with good oxygen
saturations. CTA and LENIs were negative.
Her oxygen was weaned from a non-rebreather down to room air.
Antibiotics were stopped as it did not appear that patient had
an infection, as she had no fever, leukocytosis, or purlent
sputum.
She was diuresed with lasix with much improvement in her
respiratory symtpoms.
She was started on captopril for afterload reduction given her
severe mitral regurgitation. She was discharged with daily ACE-I
and furosemide, but there is question as to whether the patient
will adhere to this regimen.
.
# EKG changes: Patient noted to have pseudonormalization of T
waves on EKG, which were concerning for possible ischemia. She
had one episode of pleuritic pain on HD#1, but no other
symptoms. Her CK have been flat, however her troponin was mildly
elevated at 0.02, which is likely secondary to her CHF
exacerbation. She is known to have a significant cardiac
history, although states she is not taking any medications.
Daily aspirin 325 mg was continued. Patient will follow up with
her primary care physician as outpatient, who is also a
cardiologist.
.
# Congestive heart failure, severe mitral regurgitation: Patient
noted to have depressed systolic EF (30%) on transthoracic echo
yesterday, and worsened MR which likely accounts for a lot of
her dyspnea. Given that she was not taking any medications for
this, will aim to initiate an appropriate cardiac regimen and
stress the importance of compliance.   Would ideally add on
beta-blocker as acute exacerbation resolves, but titrated up her
ACE-I and hold off on beta-blocker given her systolic blood
pressure is 110s.

# Anemia: Patient's last hematocrit in system i
