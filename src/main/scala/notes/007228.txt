Allergies:
Penicillins / Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Ceclor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thorocentesis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 76 yo F with h/o A Fib, CHF, HTN, chronic
UTI's, herpetic plexus injury, presents from nursing homw with
afib w/RVR and hypoxia, found to have large left pleural
effusion.  She was sent from nursing home ([**Last Name (un) **] house) after
having HR in 120's for 8-10 hours (SBP 120's) and O2 90% on RA.
Per family friend, the patient appears at her baseline mental
status and does not seem lethargic.  Currently on ciprofloxacin
250mg [**Hospital1 **] x 14 days (started on [**2125-12-22**]).  Currently, the
patient is reporting generalized pain but denies  CP, SOB,
difficulty breathing, fevers, or urinary complaints.

In the ED, the patient was found to have a large right pleural
effusion.  Her HR was consistently in the 120's with stable
SBP's in the 120s.  A U/A was grossly positive.  She was
afebrile, a WBC of 10, and lactate of 2.7.  A proBNP was 26,508.
 She was given a dose of ceftriaxone and vancomycin to cover for
a possible PNA.

Social History:
widow, was living alone in her house in [**State 760**], but since
admission [**5-17**] for CHF was staying with her daughter.
Subsequently was discharged to [**Hospital 599**] rehab after last admission
in [**5-19**]. Smoked 1.5 ppd x 35 years, quit [**2104**]. does not drink
alcohol or use illicit substances.


Family History:
mother died at 76 from CHF. father died at 76 from MI,stroke. 1
sister has DM. 1 brother is well. 3 daughters, 1 with IDDM. 2
sons, 1 [**Name2 (NI) **] with congenital rubella, disabled with epilepsy. no
other family Hx neurologic disease.

Physical Exam:
VS - T 96 HR 120 BP 120/76 RR 25 O2 100% 2L
HEENT - PERRL, dry mucous membranes
Neck - elevated JVP to ear lobe
CV - irregular, Nml S1, S2 no murmur appreciated
Chest - decreased breath sounds at left base
Abdomen - soft, obese, NT/ND, no guarding or rebound
Ext - swollen left arm; 3+ pitting edema of lower extremities
b/l' stage 4 sacral debub (to bone, no frank pus), very
maloderous, cold feet-no dopplerable pulses of DP/TP b/l, severe
pain of L hand/arm--no papules/lesions
Neuro: A&O x1 (self), no focal neurological deficits, limited
ROM of L arm due to significant pain.


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2126-1-3**] CXR - New left large pleural effusion with associated
atelectasis.  No direct evidence of CHF.
.
[**2126-1-5**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
Tiny left-sided pleural effusion. Previously seen retrocardiac
opacity is not identified on the current exam.
.
[**2126-1-4**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
[2+]tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-5-25**],
the LVEF is
lower and the severity of mitral and tricupsid regurgitation
have increased.
.
[**2126-1-3**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. HR 125
Non-specific
inferolateral T wave flattening. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2125-6-15**] the rapid atrial fibrillation and T wave
flattening are new.

Staphylococcus
      aureus and beta streptococcus).

      PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS.    SPARSE GROWTH.

         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.
