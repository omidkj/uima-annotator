distention, no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular examination:
regular, rate, and rhythm, normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Pulmonary examination:  Scattered end
inspiratory rales throughout, no wheezes or rhonchi
appreciated.  Abdominal examination:  Decreased abdominal
sounds, soft, nontender, and nondistended, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are warm and well perfused
with no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic
examination:  Drowsy, but oriented to person, place, and
time, conversant, and appropriate, bradykinesic, increased
tone throughout, with symmetric motor strength and sensation
intact to light touch.  Skin examination:  Multiple
ecchymoses throughout the upper extremities, no rash.
Rectal:  Heme positive black stool.

LABORATORIES AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count
with a white blood cell count of 15.2, hematocrit 28.4
(previously 36.1 in [**2112-9-6**]), MCV 103, platelets 270
with white blood cell differential of 77% polys, 18%
lymphocytes, 3% monocytes.  Chem-7 with a sodium of 135,
potassium 4.7, chloride 94, bicarb 31, BUN 41, creatinine
5.1, and glucose 106.  Coag studies with a PT of 13.9, INR
1.3, and PTT of 28.4.  Calcium 7.9, magnesium 2.0, and
phosphate 5.5.

Electrocardiogram on admission:  Normal sinus tachycardia at
107, with right bundle branch block, and ST depressions in V3
through V5 (new) with left atrial dilatation.

Chest x-ray on admission with slight increased chronic
opacities at the bases right greater than left, no edema,
right pleural effusion.  Abdominal CT scan was notable for
right lung base consolidation, diffuse vascular
calcification, perinephric fat, no abdominal aortic aneurysm,
spinal degenerative joint disease, no evidence of
retroperitoneal bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the Emergency Department, the patient
was found with a temperature of 95.9, blood pressure 60/43,
respiratory rate 36, heart rate 113 with an oxygen saturation
of 100% nonrebreather.  The patient received intravenous
fluids, levofloxacin, and dopamine for presumed sepsis.  The
patient's initial laboratory work was notable for a
hematocrit of 28.4, previously 36 one month prior with
hemoccult positive rectal examination.

The patient's abdominal CT scan was without evidence of
abdominal aortic aneurysm or retroperitoneal bleed.  The
patient's electrocardiogram demonstrated a right bundle
branch block and new ST depressions in leads V3 through V5.
The patient's blood pressure responded to dopamine and
intravenous fluids, and the patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management.

REMAINDER OF THE HOSPITALIZATION BY SYSTEMS:
1. Hematology:  The patient was transfused a total of 5 units
of packed red blood cells from [**10-15**] for
a hematocrit less than 30.  After the second unit of packed
red blood cells, the patient was weaned off dopamine and
maintained adequate blood pressure.  The patient was followed
with serial hematocrits q8h with persistent requirement of
transfusion for persistent gastrointestinal bleed.

Following a definitive endoscopic procedure, the patient's
hematocrit stabilized and the patient was transferred out of
the Medical Intensive Care Unit and maintained a stable
hematocrit greater than 30, without evidence of bleeding.

The patient developed thrombocytopenia while in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with a drop in platelets from 270-97 from
[**10-15**] to [**10-17**].  The patient's medications
were reviewed and Heparin was subsequently discontinued with
concern for Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.  The patient's
platelet count stabilized above 100 for the remainder of the
hospitalization without signs of bleeding.  The patient was
continued off of Heparin and the subsequent Heparin-induced
thrombocytopenic antibody was negative.  The etiology of the
thrombocytopenia is unclear.  However, potentially type I
HITT.

2. Gastrointestinal:  The patient developed melena while in
the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and a subsequent nasogastric
lavage was significant for 1 liter of coffee-ground emesis.
The patient's melena persisted and on hospital day #2, the
patient underwent an upper endoscopy with evidence of
multiple pyloric and duodenal ulcers, with the stigmata of
recent bleeding.  The patient underwent BICAP electrocautery
without further evidence of bleeding.

The patient was tested for H. pylori (negative) and gastrin
(pending at time of dictation).  The patient was started on
high dosed intravenous Protonix, now oral.  The patient is
now eight days status post electrocautery without further
evidence of bleeding.

3. Renal:  The patient is anuric, end-stage renal disease,
and continued on his previously scheduled 3x a week
hemodialysis throughout the hospitalization.  The patient had
on average 1.5-2 liters of fluid removed at each dialysis,
well tolerated.  The patient was restarted on Nephrocaps and
Renagel following the stabilization of the gastrointestinal
bleed.

4. Infectious Disease:  On admission, the patient was found
to be relatively hypothermic and hypotensive with concern for
sepsis, status post a recent pneumonia.  Blood cultures on
admission grew coag-negative Staph in [**1-11**] bottles.  Given the
patient's recent pneumonia and clinical picture, the patient
was started on empiric Vancomycin and continued on a 14-day
course for coag-negative Staph bacteremia.  Follow up blood
cultures on [**10-21**] are no growth to date.  The patient
will be continued on Va
