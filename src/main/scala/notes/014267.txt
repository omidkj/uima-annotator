EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was in no distress,

soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities were warm.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Of note, the patient drinks two shots of
vodka per day, but denies any tobacco use.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area, where she subsequently underwent a
subtotal gastrectomy and the procedure was uncomplicated.
She received 2500 cc of crystalloid, had a urine output of
250 cc, and estimated blood loss of 150 cc.  Postoperatively,
the patient did well on the first postoperative day with an
epidural in place for pain control.  She was ambulated and
the nasogastric tube was continued and the urine output was
adequate.

On the morning of postoperative day two, the patient
continues to do well, and the IV fluids are KVO.  Her IV
Lopressor dose was increased and her nasogastric tube was
removed.  Later during that day the patient experienced
increased heart rate, blood pressure, and altered mental
status.  She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring given her history of alcohol use and her history
of congestive heart failure.  She was diuresed and started on
a CIWA protocol.  Cephazolin was resumed for wound erythema
and she did well.

Her vitals stabilized.  Her temperature maxed at 102.  This
is not sustained.  Rheumatology consult was obtained for
polyarthralgia.  They recommended starting colchicine which
had good effect after 24 hours of therapy.  She was
subsequently changed over to starting liquids.  She tolerated
full liquids and then a postgastrectomy diet.  Her IV Pepcid
was changed over to po Prevacid.  The patient was transferred
to the floor on postoperative day #6.

Physical Therapy cleared the patient to be discharged to
home, however, given increased family concerns over her
safety, a re-evaluation was obtained and once again she was
cleared for discharge to home with home VNA for wound
monitoring, home Physical Therapy, and assistance with
activities of daily living, although she had been cleared for
discharge home.
