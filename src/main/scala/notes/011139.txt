Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Worsened anemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of femoral central venous line

History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old male with history dementia and end stage
kidney disease secondary to IgA nephropathy who presented to the
ED with chief complaint of worsened anemia.  The patient had
arrived at his dialysis center from his [**Hospital1 1501**].  There, he was
noted to have a ten point Hct drop and was also hypotensive
during dialysis.  On questioning he endorsed abdominal pain and
feeling generally tired/weak.  He was sent to the ED for further
work-up.

In the ED initial vital signs were BP 120/58, satting 98% on RA.
 He had a femoral line placed for access.  Hb was 7.2 and rectal
exam revealed guiac positive brown stool.  NG lavage was guiac
negative.  In the ED he dropped his blood pressure to 85/55 and
this improved with 500 cc of NS.  Nonspecific EKG changes led to
a cardiology consult and they recommended transfusion.  A CT
scan was ordered to evaluate the patient's abdominal pain that
showed changes consistent with ischemic bowel.  He received
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.  After discussion with the
[**Hospital 228**] health care proxy goals of care were established as
the patient would not want surgery but he would want all other
resuscitation measures.  Please see hospital course for summary
of remainder of ED course and other hospital course.

Review of Systems: Positive as noted above per other
documentation.  Unobtainable at arrival to MICU.

OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECG:
Normal sinus rhythm. Diffuse T wave flattening and mild ST
segment depression
in the lateral leads V4-V6. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2117-3-24**] the
marked T wave flattening is new. Consider metabolic/electrolyte
abnormality.

CT Abdomen and Pelvis W and W/O Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Portal venous gas, pneumatosis and small bowel dilatation,
compatible with ischemic bowel. A nonenhancing loop of bowel in
the left abdomen is likely infarcted.
2. Focal high attenuation area in the right lung base concerning
for
aspiration of oral contrast. Oral contrast distending the distal
esophagus
places the patient at risk for recurrent aspiration.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
4. Cholelithiasis.
5. The aorta and mesenteric vessels are patent without
significant stenosis.  The mesenteric veins are not optimally
assessed due to timing of the IV contrast bolus.
6. Expansion of the left psoas muscle with central low density,
which appears to be a fluid collection. Infection cannot be
excluded.
7. Atrophic native kidneys, with suggestion of striated
nephrograms that
could represent infection or infarction.
8. Coronary artery calcifications.
9. Findings of chronic pancreatitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 year old male with dementia, end stage renal
disease, and chronic anemia who presented with worsening anemia,
guiac positive stool, and likely ischemic bowel.

In the ED after CT scan the patient had a PEA arrest.  He
received multiple rounds of atropine and epinephrine with
eventual return of spontaneous circulation.  He was intubated
during this initial code blue event.  As attempts were made to
wheel the patient out of ED and up to MICU he had a second PEA
arrest and once again received multiple rounds of medications
and a brief period of pacing.  Shortly after this second arrest
the patient was wheeled upstairs with an ED physician
accompanying him.  He received another milligram of epinephrine
in the elevator after losing his pulse.

On arrival to MICU the patient had no spontaneous movements and
appeared cachectic and cool with mottled skin.  Per records he
had received at least 6 mg of epinephrine and three doses of
atropine.  Only palpable pulse was thready carotid pulse on
left.  Within less than five minutes of arrival to MICU patient
once again became pulse less with PEA rhythm.  He received an
additional two cycles of CPR and another milligram of
epinephrine.  Given likely etiology of arrest was thought to be
sepsis and persistent hypotension from infarcting bowel and that
no other reversible cause seemed reasonable, as well as the fact
the patient had received >20 minutes of total CPR between his
multiple events, resuscitation efforts were stopped.
