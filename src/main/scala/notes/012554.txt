Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with h/o lymphoma, GERD, HTN, dCHF presented on [**8-28**] to
[**Hospital3 628**] with shortness of breath and dxd with PNA.  Was
previously dxd with PNA and placed on Levo but failed.  Placed
on Vanco/Cefepime there.  Course complicated by resp failure
requiring BiPAP, no inubation, and hypotension requiring
pressors.  Also with dCHF exacerbation.  This caused ARF on CKD
and anuria, presumably from ATN, now placed on HD through
femoral HD line.  Hypotension now resolved.  Course also
complicated by delirium and malnutrition requiring NGT and tube
feeds (haldol and restraints in this setting).  Also with
thrombocytopenia to low of 37 over last 3 days, concern for HIT
so stopped heparin and checked HIT ab (pending). Vital signs
have been stable: afebrile, HR 70s, BP 150/52, RR 20, 100% 3L.
WBC 10.9, Cr 2, LFTs normal, Plt 37.

Today HD line clotted and is no longer working.  Case discussed
with family, which includes multiple MDs (psych, radiologist, GI
fellow).  She is now DNR/DNI and no pressors, but wishes to
continue aggressive medical care otherwise.  Thus, they request
transfer for replacement of HD cath and continued HD, as well as
continued treatment of HCAP, delirium, and malnutrition, and
also work up of thrombocytopenia.

received a total of 3 throughout her hospital stay. Her
microbiology preliminary catheter tip grew out [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.
 It was from femoral line which was pulled and replaced with a
PICC line. We will start her on fluconazole for that as well.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with h/o lymphoma, GERD, HTN, dCHF presented on [**8-28**] to
[**Hospital3 628**] with shortness of breath and dxd with PNA,
complicated by resp failure requiring BIPAP, hypotension
requring pressors. Lost HD access but continues to be anuric.
The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] to replace HD line and
continue dialysis. However, the patient's BP began to drop and
she was tansfered to the ICU with the intention to begin CVVH.
However, her pressure continued to drop and the decision was
made to make her comfort measures only. She passed away shortly
thereafter.

# Goals of Care: The was previously very independent and
functional at baseline, now with AMS in the setting of sepsis
and multiorgan failure (ARF and AMS). At admission, discussions
with the family reveal that they feel the patient is still in an
acute phase of her illness. They do not desire any further
drastic measures such as CPR, intubation, or pressors, but are
ok with the patient getting dialysis including CVVH and other
medical interventions to aggressivly treat her PNA and renal
failure. They were hoping her mental status will improve if she
bounces back from PNA. When the patient's pressures started to
drop to the 90s systolic she was transfered to the unit with the
thought of stating CVVH. However, her pressures continued to
trend down and it became clear that she would no tolerate or
benefit fom CVVH or other invasive care, so the patient was made
comfort measures only and passed soon thereafter.

# Healthcare associated Pneumonia: Course so far had been
complicated by resp failure requiring BIPAP and hypotension
requiring pressors. Treated emperically with Vanc, Cefepime.

# Catheter tip culture grew [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans at OSH:
- cont Fluconazole

# CRF requring HD: The patient's current access is clotted and
no longer usable. The patient's family initially desired
dialysis or CVVH, and the patient was tansfered to the ICU with
the intention of getting CVVH, but was unable to maintain her
pressure and was made comfort measures only.

# Delerium: The patient has multiple possible causes of altered
mental status, and is likely encephalopathic. The patient is
septic from b/l pneumonia, and has evidence of end-organ failure
(incl ARF), sepsis was the most likely explanation of AMS. The
patient also had CRF requiring HD, with elevated BUN. Other DDx
inclues non-convulsive status epilepticus, recent CVA, hypoxic
damage, or meningitis. Fs glucose was stable.

# Nutrition: severe malnutrition. NG tube in place. Tube feeds
initiated.

# Thrombocytopenia: Plts 37 on admission, trended down during
prior admission. Heparin SQ DVT PPx was DCed for concern of
HITT. HITT
