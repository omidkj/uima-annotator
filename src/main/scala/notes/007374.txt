PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  This is a 70-year-old man with a past
medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, an
ejection fraction of 35%, no known coronary artery disease,
who presents for evaluation of ventricular fibrillation
arrest.  He was in his usual state of health until the day on
admission when he was eating dinner with his wife at home.
He had a sudden collapse.  His wife is a registered nurse.
She felt no pulse and no breathing.  She called 911 and began
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Emergency medical technicians arrived and noted ventricular
fibrillation.  He was shocked once at 200 joules with return
of blood pressure and pulse.  The patient was intubated and
taken to [**Hospital1 69**] where he was
found to be slow ventricular tachycardia.  He was given
lidocaine.  On arrival to the Emergency Department
electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with Q-T noted
to be 0.56 seconds, a QTc of 0.52 seconds.  In the Emergency
Room, potassium was noted to be 3.  The patient was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: (Notable for)
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Prostate cancer.
4.  Status post laminectomy of his neck in the [**2131**] with
residual altered sensation and strength in the bilaterally
upper and lower extremities secondary to a car crash.
5.  Right eye cataract.
6.  Ejection fraction of 35%.  No previous catheterizations.
Normal stress test approximately two years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.d.,
allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d., verapamil-SR 240 mg p.o. q.d.,
Zestril 40 mg p.o. q.d., digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.,
spironolactone 25 mg p.o. p.r.n., Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d., iron
replacement, potassium replacement 25 mEq p.o. q.d..

ALLERGIES:  ASPIRIN which causes nausea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination blood pressure
was 125/62, heart rate was 86 in atrial fibrillation.  On
physical examination, an elderly male who was intubated and
sedated, and unresponsive.  Pupils were 2 mm and minimally
reactive.  There was a left temporal hematoma.  Neck was
supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Heart was in a regular rhythm.
Normal S1 and S2.  A 2/6 systolic murmur radiating to the
axilla.  Chest was clear to auscultation to anterior
examination.  Abdomen was soft and nontender, normal active
bowel sounds.  There was 1+ extremity edema.  Neurologically,
the patient was intubated and unresponsive.  Moved all
extremities.  Withdrew to pain.

LABORATORY:  Laboratory analysis showed a white blood cell
count of 6.8, hematocrit was 41.6, platelets were 279.
Sodium was 143, potassium 3, chloride was 101, bicarbonate
was 21, BUN was 16, creatinine was 1, glucose was 148.
Calcium was 8.8, phosphorous was 3.9, magnesium was 1.4.
PTT was 35.7, INR was 3.3.  ALT of 16, AST 31, alkaline
phosphatase 78, amylase 56, total bilirubin 1.2.  Digoxin
level was 0.8.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram #1 from the field
showed accelerated idioventricular rhythm versus ventricular
tachycardia versus an supraventricular tachycardia with
aberrancy at about 150, with a Q-T of 0.6.  No ST-T wave
abnormalities.

Electrocardiogram #2 showed narrow complex at 75, normal
axis, T wave sloping down in I, aVL, V3 to V6.

Electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department on arrival
showed a regular narrow complex at 75, normal axis, some T
wave sloping in V2 to V6, Q-T of 0.56, QTc of 0.52.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly.

Head CT showed no evidence of hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for further management.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was monitored very carefully
on telemetry following ventricular fibrillation arrest.  The
etiology was unclear for the arrest.  The possibilities
included an ischemic event versus electrolyte abnormalities
in the setting of a structural heart disease.  The patient
had a known ejection fraction of 35%; although he has never
had a catheterization to work this up further.  He has had
previous stress tests which have been negative.  It was felt
it was possible in the settings of the electrolyte
abnormalities extended Q-T perhaps secondary to verapamil and
the structural heart disease that the patient had arrhythmia
based on these; although ischemia could not be excluded.



The patient was kept on lidocaine overnight which was then
tapered off.  He was maintained on beta blocker, ACE
inhibitor, and aspirin.  He had no subsequent ventricular
tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation during his hospital
stay.  Initial cardiac workup was deferred for several days
while his neurologic status was being evaluated.

Eventually, Electrophysiology was consulted.  They
recommended pursuing an initially conservative course,
treating the patient with amiodarone, and recommended
re-evaluating in two to four weeks for possible
catheterization as well as electrophysiology study with
possible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.
The patient's family agreed with this plan, and the patient
was stated on amiodarone.

2.  NEUROLOGY:  On arrival to the Coronary Care Unit the
patient was intubated and unresponsive.  He began to wake up
over the course of the first night,  and the next day the
patient was weaned from the ventilator and extubated.  He was
responsive, however, he exhibited some short-term memory loss
and some disorientation.  This was felt to be secondary to
anoxic brain injury; although, initially, there was a
question of whether the patient was withdrawing from alcohol
as he has a history of heavy drinking prior to this.  For
that reason, he was kept on Ativan for several days which was
eventually tapered off without incident.

Following that, the Neurology and [**Hospital 13623**] Rehabilitation
Services were consulted and they felt that his presentation
was consistent with anoxic brain injury.  It was anticipated
that Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] would have a slow recovery but could
eventually see considerable improvement.

3.  TRAUMA:  The patient initially had a large left occipital
hematoma.  A CT scan, however, showed no acute fracture and
no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient had a slowly trending down
hematocrit during his stay while on heparin.  The patient had
episodic rectal bleeding which was a chronic problem for him
from radiation-induced changes following therapy for prostate
cancer.  His hematocrit, however, stabilized in the low 30s.
He never required a blood transfusion during this admission
and tolerated anticoagulation with Coumadin.

5.  RHYTHM:  The patient's rhythm remained atrial
fibrillation/flutter throughout his stay rate controlled at
all times.

6.  PHYSICAL THERAPY:  It was felt that the patient would
benefit from a rehabilitation stay at discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  He was sent to rehabilitation for a short
cardiac in general rehabilitation stay.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.
