patient's pulse was 73, respiratory rate of 16, O2
saturations of 96% on 55% oxygen.  She was ventilated on
assist control 15 by 680 cc, 55%, PEEP of 5.

EXTREMITIES:  Trace edema, +2 pedal pulses.

ADMISSION LABS:  CBC:  White blood cells of 9.3, hematocrit
of 27.6, platelets of 206.  Coagulation studies:  PT of 14.1,
INR of 1.3.  Chem-7:  134, 3.6, 94, 21, 19, 1.4, 270.
Calcium 7.6, magnesium 2.7. phosphorus 1.5.  Arterial blood
gases on admission:  pH of 7.31, PCO2 of 49, PO2 of 122.  AST
of 122, ALT of 67, lipase of 115.  Alkaline phosphatase of
162.  Total bilirubin of 1.1.

The patient had a catheterization that showed diffuse three
vessel disease, 80% obstruction of the proximal RCA, 100%
obstruction of the distal RCA, 90% obstruction of the mid
distal D1, 50% obstruction of the mid left circumflex, 100%
obstruction of the OM1.  Cardiac output was 5.1 with a
cardiac index of 3.1 and an elevated wedge of 24.

HOSPITAL COURSE ON ADMISSION:  The patient's cardiac status
on admission revealed she had congestive heart failure due to
demand ischemia from abdominal pain.  This lead to the
patient having flash pulmonary edema and lead to the patient
being intubated.  The patient was slowly diuresed with Lasix
and outpatient medications were began.  The patient's
captopril dose was titrated up from 12.5 to 50.  Lopressor
and isosorbide dinitrate was added on.  The patient was also
added with Imdur and aspirin and Lipitor were added back onto
regimen.  The patient had an echocardiogram done that showed
an ejection fraction of 60% to 70%.  Initially, the patient
came in with elevated CKs and troponin and with a diagnosis
of non Q wave myocardial infarction.  CKs and troponins
resolved and the patient's non Q-wave myocardial infarction
was resolving.

Respiratory wise, the patient began intubated and after
aggressive diuresing, was extubated on [**2191-7-3**].

Hematocrit wise, the patient initially had a low hematocrit
of 27.4 and required 2 units of packed red blood cells.  The
patient's hematocrit initially responded well, then dropped
down to 32.7 and eventually stabilized at 36.6.  The patient
was guaiac negative and Gastroccult negative also.  CT of the
abdomen also ruled out retroperitoneal bleed.

Gastrointestinal wise, the patient had outside lipase of 500
with elevated liver function tests.  Liver function tests and
lipase resolved while in hospital.  The patient had
ultrasound that showed gallstones, but no cholecystitis.  The
patient also had a CT that showed no pancreatic pseudocyst.

Infectious disease wise, the patient arrived on ampicillin,
Flagyl and Levaquin from outside hospital and continued
antibiotics for a seven day course and eventually discharged.
The patient was afebrile after antibiotics were discontinued.

The patient was discharged in stable condition with diagnosis
of non Q-wave myocardial infarction and gallstone
pancreatitis.

q day, Mavik 4 mg q day, Lasix 40 mg po q day, Imdur 30 mg po
q day, Lipitor 10 mg po q day.
