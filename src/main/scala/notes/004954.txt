CXR: Right upper lobe anterior segment consolidation.
Differential includes pneumonia and infarction. Lung neoplasm is
considered less likely but followup radiographs are recommended
to ensure resolution following therapy and to exclude this
possibility.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged. Pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable. No definite pleural effusions are
seen.

EKG: atrial fibrillation, t-wave inversion in V4 - V6, poor
r-wave progression.

[**2170-2-28**]: CT CHEST WITHOUT/WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST and
Reconstruction: The soft tissue window images reveal large
bilateral filling defects in the pulmonary vasculature. There is
a large thrombus adherent to the wall of the origin of right
pulmonary artery with another large thrombus at the bifurcation
extending into the segmental branches of the right upper, middle
and lower lobes. On the left, a large thrombus is seen in the
left lower lobe branch pulmonary artery extending into the
segmental branches. There is a large wedge shaped area of
consolidation involving the right upper lobe inferolaterally.
There is another small wedge shaped area of consolidation in the
left lower lobe. These could represent areas of infarction or
consolidation. A moderate sized right sided pleural effusion is
also noted. IMPRESSION: 1) Massive pulmonary embolism involving
the right upper, middle, lower and left lower lobes. The clot at
the origin of the right main pulmonary artery is more eccentric
and is likely chronic. The rest of the emboli appear more acute.
2) Wedge shaped consolidation in the right upper and lower lobes
could represent consolidation or infarction however the smaller
wedge shaped consolidation involving the right lower lobe
appears to be an infarct. 3) Moderate right sided pleural
effusion. 4) Multiple gallstones.

[**2170-2-28**]: U/S BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS: Deep vein thrombosis
involving the mid to distal left superficial femoral and
popliteal veins, probably acute to subacute.

[**2170-3-1**]: Echocardiogram conclusions: The left atrium is dilated.
The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is a large (>6cm
long by 1.5 cm wide) elongated redundant mobile mass in the
right atrium consistent with thrombus (appearance of deep venous
thrombus embolization). There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion.

[**2170-3-1**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation Long QTc interval Consider
anteroseptal infarct - age undetermined Nonspecific ST-T changes
 Since previous tracing, slower heart rate seen; T wave
inversions in V2-V3

[**2170-3-2**] Echocardiogram Conclusions:  The left atrium is
moderately dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated.  A
5-6cm x 1.5cm (vein cast) serpiginous mobile mass is seen in the
body of the right atrium with minimal herniation through the
tricuspid orifice. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate
global hypokinesis. No intraventricular thrombus is identified.
Right ventricular chamber size is mildly increased with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis (preservation of RV apical function
- [**Last Name (un) 13367**]
sign). The ascending aorta and aortic arch are mildly dilated.
The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis.  Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2170-3-1**], the  left ventricle is now mildly dilated and global
systolic function is slightly more depressed, right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis is now present, and the the heart rate is
increased, The size of the right atrial thrombus is similar.
Based on [**2162**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis
recommended). Clinical decisions regarding the need for
prophylaxis should be
