Lethargy, altered mental status, hypotension

1) Femoral line placed at outside hospital and discontinued on

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111020**] is an 87 year old female with past medical history
of chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure,
hypertension, anemia, and aortic stenosis and insufficiency who
presents with hypotension. The patient had had poor PO intake
and had not been doing well for the last several months. She was
noted to be hiding her medications under her pillow and very
constipated. She was refusing to eat or drink or get out of bed.
Her family brought her to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED for further evaluation
after they noted her to be "slumping" at times. Her daughter
reports that worsening constipation and mental status over the
last few days was what prompted the ED visit. Her daughter
reports that recently the patient has needed to be spoon-fed
medications. She has been lethargic "for months," but this has
been worse over the last days. No fevers, chills, cough, or
other significant reported symptoms. Daughter reports that the
patient "isn't much of a talker" but will say yes and no.

She was transferred here from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], where her presenting
vital signs were: systolic blood pressure 68/48 right arm,
110/70 left, heart rate 79, respiratory rate 33 and temperature
of 94.2 rectally.
At [**Location (un) 620**], she was noted to have a lactate of 6.4. A left
femoral line was placed. She was given two liters of normal
saline and started on dopamine, however she became tachycardic
so was switched to levophed. She was given 1 gram of vancomycin
and 1 gram of ceftriaxone. She was guaiac negative there. She
was given 300 mg aspirin for an elevated troponin of 0.806 (0.6
in 6/[**2110**]). She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were: temperature of 95.7,
heart rate of 80, blood pressure of 74/46, respiratory rate of
20, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Repeat lactate was 4.9.
Intubation was discussed with family who wished to hold off
unless absolutely critical. Patient was placed on a NRB and
tolerated CT of the abdomen which was negative for GI process.
Her levophed was titrated down after being given 3 more liters
of IVF. She was noted to have profuse diarrhea; there was
question of whether she had been given laxatives or disimpacted.
She was placed on a bairhugger. Notes make question of possible
vaginal bleed, possibly after self-disimpaction of stool.

Upon arrival to the ICU, her systolic blood pressure was in the
70-80 range. She is moving all extremities and inconsistently
follows one-step commands such as open your eyes. She was
moaning and yelling out at times.

Of note, patient was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] in [**2111-5-4**]
after presenting with shortness of breath, lethargy, and
decreased appetite. She was noted to have acute on chronic renal
insufficiency with a creatinine bump from 1.5 to 2.1 and was
hydrated. Her Synthroid dose was increased to 100 mcg at that
time for a TSH of 11. She completed an antibiotic regimen for an
urinary tract infection as well. An echo at that time
demonstrated EF 55-60% with grade I diastolic dysfunction, mild
aortic stenosis, mild aortic regurgitation, mild mitral
regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
and tricuspid regurgitation, no pericardial effusion.

In the ICU she was continued on broad spectrum abx (Flagyl,
Cefepime, and Azithro) which were eventually d/c'ed since her
blood culture results were consistent with contaminants-([**Location (un) 620**]
blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
pansensitive, resistant to quinolones and cefazolin)Eventually,
all were discontinued and switched to Levaquin 250mg  qd PO for
plan of 5 day course.  C diff x2 are neg so far. An echo was
performed which was negative for vegetations.  She had acute on
chronic renal failure which improved with hydration. She
developed hypernatremia which is being treated with 1/2 NS.

Blood cx [**2111-8-4**] from [**Location (un) 620**]: [**12-5**] coag neg staph, pan-sensitive;
[**1-5**] coag negative staph, 2 different colonies, one
pan-sensitive, the other resistent to cefazolin, levofloxacin,
oxacillin, penicillin

Blood cx at [**Hospital1 18**] ngtd [**8-5**], [**8-6**], [**8-7**], [**8-8**]

Urine cx: >100,000 organisms of yeast

C.diff negative [**8-8**]

TTE [**2111-8-7**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No
discrete vegetation is seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate
([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic
stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. If clinically
suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on transthoracic
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2111-8-5**]: 1. Likely ileus, but no bowel
obstruction or abscess. 2. Significant interval increase in
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, especially infrarenal
portion, with saccular non-calcified appearance concerning for
risk of rupture. 3.
