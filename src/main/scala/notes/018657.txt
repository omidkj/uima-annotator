Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3853**]
Chief Complaint:
"R leg trauma and GI bleed."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- ORIF of displaced R supracondylar oblique distal femur
fracture
- IVC filter placement
- Upper Endoscopy with Cauterization of bleeding duodenal ulcers


History of Present Illness:
85 YO F with h/o HTN, HLD, DM, asthma, who presented 7 days
after slipping and falling on her leg while vacationing in
[**Country 3515**]. She was placed in splint on return to US. In [**Name (NI) **], pt
found to have displaced R distal femur fx and was admitted to
ortho, where she underwent ORIF and plate placement on [**7-29**].
Venous US done [**7-28**] to rule out DVT showed nonocclusive thrombus
in R popliteal vein, and she was started on lovenox/coumadin. On
[**7-30**] pt had emesis with PO and 3 episodes of maroon stools and
melena. On [**7-31**] pt had one episode hematesis with HR 130s.
Received IVF boluses and protonix drip, and lovenox/coumadin
withheld. EGD showed gastritis and 2 large duodenal bulb ulcers,
one actively bleeding and other with large clot. Hct 24.2 (from
34) after EGD, and pt received 4U PRBC on admission to MICU.
.
MICU COURSE: Pt febrile on admission, was pan-cx (urine
negative, blood pending). Required bolus for low UOP and
tachycardia. Received 3 separate PRBC transfusions on [**2119-8-1**].
IVF filter placed [**2119-8-1**]. PPI drip continued. On [**2119-8-2**] GI
cauterized as much GI bleed as possible. Treated empirically for
PUD (amoxicillin, clarithromycin, PPI for 14 day course that
started [**2119-8-2**]), H. pylori Ab test was positive. She was noted
to be hypertensive on [**2119-8-2**] to SBP 194, and treated with
hydralazine, metoprolol, and HCTZ. Of note, home simvastatin was
held because of clarithromycin interaction.
.
Today, she complains of R knee pain in surgical site, but no
other complaints. Specifically denies abdominal pain, chest
pain, SOB, bleeding, numbness, tingling.

HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2119-8-2**]):
POSITIVE BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
.
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2119-8-2**]):
MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH
FECAL CONTAMINATION.
.
EKG:  [**2119-7-28**]
Sinus tachycardia at rate of 102, normal axis, normal intervals,
no signs of atrial or ventricular enlargement, No ST segment
elevations or depressions with isolated T-wave inversion in V1.
Aside from increased rate, no change from prior on [**2119-7-28**].
.
R Knee/Pelvis/Femur XR [**2119-7-28**]
PELVIS: The bony pelvis is intact. The hip joints are symmetric
with minimal degenerative change. Degenerative changes of the
lower lumbar spine is seen.
RIGHT HIP: No femoral neck fractures are present. Minimal
superior
subchondral sclerosis is present.
RIGHT FEMUR: There is an oblique displaced fracture through the
right distal femur metadiaphyseal junction. The distal femur is
impacted medially and posteriorly with approximately 2 cm of
overriding. A moderate joint effusion is seen in the knee.
IMPRESSION: Displaced distal femur fracture.
.
CXR [**2119-7-28**]
FINDINGS: A single portable AP chest radiograph was obtained.
The lungs are hyperinflated with flattened diaphragms consistent
with emphysema. Aside from right basal calcified granuloma, the
lungs are clear. No effusion or pneumothorax is present. The
heart and mediastinal contours are normal. The right humeral
head is severely subluxed superiorly, probably due to
degeneration from longstanding rotator cuff tear. Findings are
stable since [**2118-9-2**].
IMPRESSION: Emphysema. Apparently chronic severe right shoulder
subluxation.
.
R shoulder XR [**2119-7-28**]
FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture or dislocation. The humeral
head is high riding, consistent with a chronic rotator cuff
rupture. There are secondary degenerative changes with
sclerosis, joint space narrowing and large osteophytes about the
humeral head. There is narrowing of the AC joint with spurring
and sclerosis. The visualized lung and ribs are unremarkable.
There is no soft tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign
body.
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or dislocation. Severe
degenerative changes in the shoulder joint and high-riding
humeral head secondary to chronic rotator cuff rupture.
.
Venous ultrasound [**2119-7-28**]
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of
bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and
tibial veins.
There is non-occlusive thrombus material seen on grayscale
imaging within a segment of the right popliteal vein. At this
site, the vein does not fully compress and incomplete vascular
flow is identified.

The remainder of the vessels of both legs demonstrate normal
flow,
compression, and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus seen within the right
popliteal vein.
.
R leg fluo [**2119-7-28**]
FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION: Multiple views of the right femur.
Status post ORIF of the right femur. The hardware appears
intact. Improved alignment of the distal femur comminuted
fracture. Total intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging time 84.7
seconds. Please see operative report for further details.
.
CT ABD [**2119-8-1**]:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a 4 mm calcified granuloma
in the right
lower lobe (2:5). Note is made of areas of linear subsegmental
atelectasis in
the left lower lobe overlying a fat-containing Bochdalek hernia.
The heart is
notable for a small amount of coronary arterial calcification.
