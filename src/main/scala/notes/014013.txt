Imaging:
[**4-2**]: CT Abd:
s/p AAA repair w/ expected postsurgical appearance surrounding
aorta and expected small pneumoperitoneum. Intermediate density

fluid layer in pelvis, likely postsurgical. No e/o aorto-enteric

fistula. Nonspecific mildly dilated loops of small bowel w/
fluid
levels, but no transition point, may represent post-op ileus but

early ischemia not entirely excluded. Although there is normal
bowel wall enhancement throughout and no pneumatosis. Study not

timed for eval of vessels but celiac and SMA appear patent w/
atherosclerotic calcification at origin. [**Female First Name (un) 899**] not well
visualized.
Moderate b/l simple fluid attenuation pleural effusions.

[**4-6**]: Low lung volumes but no acute intrathoracic process

[**4-7**]: CT abd: There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions,
not significantly changed compared with the prior study. There
is associated compressive atelectasis at the lung bases. There
is a small amount of perihepatic fluid. No biliary duct
dilatation.
The patient is status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and
there is a small amount of air seen within the aneurysm sac.
This has decreased significantly in extent compared to the prior
study. The pancreas is unremarkable in appearance. There has
been interval creation of a left lower quadrant colostomy. There
is a small amount of free fluid in the right paracolic gutter.
No enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta involves the origin
of both the celiac and SMA. This is also unchanged compared to
multiple prior studies. There is a tiny amount of free air seen
anteriorly within the abdomen at the level of the stomach
(2:28); this was present on the prior study also.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] elective open 4.2 cm infrarenal AAA repair
w/ 18
mm Dacron tube graft on [**2175-3-31**] with Vascular Surgery (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 43078**]. The patient had been doing as expected
post-operatively until early [**2175-4-2**] when she started having
increased confusion and lethargy when OOB to chair.  Her mental
status continued to wax and wane throughout the day.  Her abd
was increasingly distended and tender to palpation with concern
for peritonitis.    She started V/C/F. Guaiac originally was
negative, and she had a normal brown BM around 4PM.  However, 1
hr later the patient had a moderate BM with blood and no clots.
On examination, she was markedly distended and diffusely tender
with guarding.  CT scan was fairly unrevealing demonstrating
simply fluid in the pelvis and perihepatic space but no clear
changes for ischemia in her colon.  Laboratory studies have been
relatively unremarkable.  However, given the patient's
significant exam and clinical course following her AAA repair,
concern for ischemic colitis is significant.  Risks and benefits
of exploratory laparotomy, sigmoid colectomy and end  colostomy
were discussed with the patient and her family.  The patient was
somewhat confused so her daughter, her healthcare proxy,
provided consent.

Patient [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] exploratory laparotomy with sigmoid colectomy
and end colostomy. She was transferred to the SICU for
continuing resuscitation and monitoring post-operatively.
Patient was extubated on POD#1 ([**2175-4-3**]) of her colectomy.

Patient was found to be confused after extubation. A CT scan of
her head showed resolving thalamic hemorrhage, maxillary sinus
swollen. A diagnosis of post-operative delirium was made with
Psychiatry consult on [**4-5**]. She was taken off Ativan and given
Precedex which improved her mental status mildly.

On [**4-8**], she was started on clear liquid diet given gas in
ostomy bag but promptly vomited and the ICU team held off on
further POs. Her Plavix was restarted on [**4-8**]. TPN was
continued. Vancomycin was discontinued in the morning. She
received nebulizer treatments for wheezing every 4hrs.  She was
given a one time dose of Lasix 20mg x 2 for a goal diuresis of
1L per day. Her mental status continued to improve. During
workup of her post-operative delirium, she had an RPR that was
sent that came back positive. Treponemal antibodies were sent.
ID deferred treatment until the results from these tests
returned back.

On [**4-9**], she was transferred to the floor.  She was started on
Lasix 20mg IV twice a day for anasarca. She continued to produce
gas in her ostomy bag w/ little output after her transfer out of
the unit. Her nausea and vomiting resolved. TPN was continued on
the floor.

On [**4-11**], she had a KUB to evaluate for an ileus/obstruction and
revealed no abnormalities. She was advanced to a regular diet.
She tolerated a regular diet and had a slight increase in ostomy
output (30ccs). The primary team recommended milk of magnesia,
but did not receive a dose prior to her transfer to rehab.

On [**4-12**], she continued to tolerate a regular diet and TPN was
discontinued.  Her weight continued to trend down, but she had
persistent lower extremity edema. She received [**Male First Name (un) **] hose. She was
switched from IV to PO Lasix. On the day of discharge, her
weight was down to 68.9kgs, which was slightly higher than her
admission weight 63.5kgs. The results from her treponemal
antibodies returned back nonreactive and quantitative RPR titers
were 1:2.
