Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ORIF L hip
IVC filter placed


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 39618**] is an 82 year old female with history of HTN,
melanoma, PAF, and NPH s/p VP shunt admitted after a fall [**2124-3-19**]
with L hip fracture and bilateral subdural hematomas. No LOC,
but did feel dizzy prior to fall. She was admitted to the
neurosurgical ICU.
.
Incidentally, on Cspine and follow up CT scan she was found to
have extensive pleuroparenchymal scarring and traction
bronchiectasis with calcification involving R>L apex which
raised the question of TB, though the patient denied any
shortness of breath, cough, or fever, she did report chills at
night and a 35 lb weight over last year. She noted that she has
had PPDs placed in the past and believes that one may have been
positive, however she had never received any treatment. ID was
consulted.


Past Medical History:
NPH s/p VP shunt
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
Osteoporosis
h/o amaurosis fugax
PAF
Melanoma, on face s/p excision
Bilateral SDH hematoma
Left Hip Fracture

Lives at home alone in a retirement community. No alcohol,
tobacco or drug use. She is a retired social worker for
psychiatric patients.

Family History:
Father has a history of TB.

[**3-19**] Chest CT: IMPRESSION:
1) Biapical pleural parenchymal scarring, R>L. On the right,
there is traction bronchiectasis but no true cavitation. This
finding remains nonspecific, and could relate to a number of
chronic infectious and inflammatory causes ([**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Doctor First Name **] or other
granulomatous disease); correlation with clinical picture and
any prior chest CTs is recommended, as TB is not excluded.
2) Diffuse, peripheral peribronchiolar nodules consistent with
small airways inflammation; this is also very nonspecific
finding with a broad differential including infectious and
inflammatory etiologies
.
[**3-19**] Hip film: IMPRESSION: Comminuted intertrochanteric fracture
left hip, with varus and anterior apex angulation.
.

[**3-20**] CT head w/o contrast: IMPRESSION:
1. Thin "balanced" bilateral subdural hematomas with minimal
mass effect on the subjacent gyri, and no significant shift of
midline structures. These may be acute-on-chronic.
2. Questionable small subarachnoid hemorrhagic component in the
left parietal sulci.
3. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter in place.

[**3-20**] Echo: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color  Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal  cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall  motion is
normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal  defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The  aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased  gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There  is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left  ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve  leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**3-23**] Head CT
1. Bilateral acute on chronic subdural convexity hematomas,
moderately increased compared to before; displacement of the
cerebral parenchyma on the left side with partial effacement of
the left lateral ventricle.
2. New subfalcine subdural hematoma - mild to moderate.
3. Atherosclerotic disease with calcification involving
bilateral ICA with 30-40% stenosis of the origin of the left
ICA; moderate stenosis of the right vertebral artery origin;
moderate stenosis of left vertebral artery with no
calcification.
4. Decreased blood volume in the left temporal lobe, unclear if
this is due to more proximal cervical ICA stenosis. No increase
in MTT to suggest acute infarct.
5. No obvious evidence of cerebral infarct on the present study.
.
[**3-24**] CT Head- IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged mild to moderate acute on chronic subdural
hematomas, left more than right, with mass effect on the left
cerebral hemisphere.
2. Marginal increase in the subfalcine hematoma.
3. Unchanged 1.1 cm left temporal intraparenchymal hematoma.
4. Study moderately limited due to motion artifacts
Increasing bilateral subdural hematomas per neuro and neurosurg.
Awaiting official rads read.
.

[**3-27**] CXR: AP SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: The patient is
status post ventriculoperitoneal placement. The cardiac
silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Pulmonary
vascular redistribution and prominence has increased slightly
from prior exam. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
increased. There are no new consolidations. No pneumothorax is
identified. There is a 6mm rounded opacity in the soft tissues
of the right arm which was not previously imaged and is likley
related to the skin.


Brief Hospital Course:
82F with h/o NPH s/p VP shunt, paroxysmal afib, HTN who was
admitted s/p fall with b/l SDH and L hip fracture.  The patient
was initially observed overnight in the Neuro-ICU; her SDH was
stable overnight.  Ortho performed ORIF of her L hip fracture on
[**3-21**].  She was transferred to Medicine [**2124-3-22**].
.
On [**2124-3-23**] the patient was found to have noted to have new
neurological changes with right sided facial droop and new right
sided weakness. Noted to have a 10 point Hct drop since her
surgery. Developed new rapid Afib with HR in the 130's, and BP's
in the 120 range. Given Lopressor 5mg IV x 2 (no change in HR,
[**Month (only) **] SBP). Then given dilt 10mg IV with drop in HR to 90's but
also drop in SBP to 90's. Stat Head CT at that time showed
increase size in the SDH. Skull films were taken to evaluate her
VP shunt. She was transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU the patient was tranfused 3 units PRBC's.  Repeat
Head CT [**3-24**] showed a stable SDH since [**3-23**].  She had an IVC
filter placed on [**3-25**] for PE prophylaxis. Induced sputum was
negative X1 for AFB; the patient was unable to provide further
sputum samples. MS [**First Name (Titles) 4245**] [**Last Name (Titles) 39619**], however, R sided weakness
and facial droop resolved.  A UTI was diagnose
