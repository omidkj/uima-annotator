Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Bactrim / Procardia

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
87yo M with hx of DM, HTN, diverticulosis,s/p partial colectomy,
depression, CKD, parkinson's vascular dementia, s/p pacemaker,
who has been experiencing night desaturation for the past few
days, worse this evening.  At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, he had awoken with
SOB, satting 89% on 3L NC, improved to 95% on mask at 5L.  Pt
was given Lasix 40 mg po and 81 mg ASA.  Pt had a second episode
of SOB overnight, satting 70-80% on mask at 8L and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  RR was 28, BP 150/80, HR 64, T 98 ax.
Patient was non-communicative at time of exam and history was
obtained from medical record and from family report.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, SpO2 76% on NRB, ABG of 7.34/66/53.  He
was started on BiPap (FiO2 60%, PEEP 5, PS 10) with improvement
of O2 sat to 90-100%.  He received a nitro gtt, Lasix 60 mg IV,
levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and albuterol nebulizer.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He has
a chronic raspy cough per the daughter. [**Name (NI) **] of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations.  Daughter is not aware of any dyspnea on exertion,
orthopnea.  She has noted that he had ankle edema ("elephant
legs") in the late winter and early spring and had asked [**Hospital1 100**]
Senior Life to start the patient on Lasix.  Daughter denies any
syncope or presyncope.  He has poor functional capacity at
baseline.

The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-5-25**],
the previously suspected thrombus on the pacing wire is not
apparent on the current study. However, the suboptimal image
quality precludes close examination of the pacing wrie. The
other findings are similar.

UPRIGHT PORABLE CHEST
Streaky linear atelectasis is noted extending from the region of
the right
hila and at the left base in this patient with persistent low
lung volumes. No evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema,
pneumothorax, or consolidation to suggest pneumonia. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with stable appearance
to abnormal contour projecting above the aortic knob consistent
with the patient's known pseudoaneurysm. Positioning of
pacemaker leads is unchanged.

Lateral views are not well penetrated. The right hemidiaphragm
is elevated, as before. The lungs appear clear except for
streaky density in the retrocardiac area, which is suboptimally
evaluated. The cardiac silhouette appears large but may be
exaggerated by AP technique. A 4.5 cm round density projected
adjacent to the aortic knob, consistent with a known aortic
pseudoaneurysm is unchanged. Mediastinal structures are
unchanged in appearance, and the bony thorax is grossly intact.
A bipolar transvenous pacemaker remains in place.
IMPRESSION: Streaky density in the retrocardiac area that may
represent
partial atelectasis or consolidation. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm. No definite interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 87yo man with a history of Diabetes,
Hypertension, diastolic CHF, s/p pacemaker, CKD, Parkinson's,
and vascular dementia who presented for SOB/hypoxia and found to
be in hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring BiPap.
.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure:  The patient was
hypoxic on admission with  SpO2 76% on NRB and an arterial blood
gas of 7.34/66/53.  He was started on BiPap (FiO2 60%, PEEP 5,
PS 10) with improvement of O2 sat to 90-100% which was weaned
over several hours.  The patient had no history of COPD or
asthma.  His acute hypoxia was felt to be due to diastolic heart
failure, although CXR appeared to have mild pulmonary edema
without significant change from [**4-22**].  The patient was afebrile,
without cough, fever or leukocytosis.  PE was considered given a
previously noted thrombus i
