History of Present Illness:
History from daughter in law and granddaughter.
Ms. [**Known lastname 6302**] is an 82yo Polish-speaking woman with CAD s/p
anterior apical MI, chronic systolic and diastolic CHF ([**2181-5-23**]
EF 50%), s/p PPM and ICD, asthma, and HTN, who presents after
recent hospitalizatiion for anemia with [**Last Name (un) **]/EGD and capsule
study showing small intestinal ulcers, discharged yesterday, who
presents with fever to 38.8.  The son called the patient's house
around noon but the line was busy.  He went to her house and
found the patient lying on the floor in the bathroom next to the
toilet in her own brown stool.  The patient stated that she had
slipped off the toilet.  She denied LOC, head trauma.  The
patient's daughter in law also arrived at the patient's house
and she noted that the patient felt dizzy, short of breath and
wheezy after the fall.  Daughter in law gave her Tylenol #3 and
albuterol.  Noted to have 38.4 fever at home.  Family called Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 4844**], the PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] he told them to go to the ED for
evaluation.  Pt did not want to come to the hospital after most
recent hospitalization.
.
Of note, recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2181-10-10**] - [**2181-10-17**] for GI
bleeding. Transfused pRBC and Hct stable. GI pefromed EGD and
[**Last Name (un) **] which did not show active source of her bleed.  Also had
capsule endoscopy, results pending.  ASA and coumadin held given
bleeding. Her outpt cardiologist wanted to restart ASA after
capsule study results obtained. Capsule study showed:  Non
bleeding ulcer in the small bowel, there is a possible second
ulcer in the small bowel, thought to be likely source of
bleeding.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T 101.5 (tmax 103.6 rectal) HR 65  BP
140/60  RR 22 100% on 6 L NC. Labs drawn, notable for elevated
lactate of 3.0, leukocytosis 12.4, anemia 28.2.  UA, Urine
culture, blood cultures pending.  EKG, CXR, CT abd/pelvis
completed.  Given acetaminophen 650 mg x 1, levofloxacin 750 mg
IV x 1, flagyl 500 mg IV x 1, albuterol and ipratropium nebs.
BP trended down from 100s to mid-upper 80s (lowest 86/38). 1.5 L
NS given. RIJ placed.  GI consulted for gross blood in rectal
vault. Surgery consulted. VS on transfer: 60  102/44 20 100% 2 L

ROS: unable to obtain.

Pertinent Results:
[**10-18**] Blood cultures x 2: pending
[**10-18**] Urine culture: pending
.
STUDIES:
.
LUE US [**10-26**]:  Negative for DVT.
.
Xray Ankle [**10-25**]:
No previous images. Generalized osteopenia of the visualized
bony
elements. No evidence of fracture or dislocation. The extensive
vascular
calcification suggests underlying diabetes.

.
Video Oropharyngeal Swallow Study [**10-24**]:
Penetration into the vestibule with nectar and thin
consistencies. Please refer to the complete report and dietary
recommendations from speech Pathology.
.
Chest US [**10-22**]:
The pacemaker is identified over the left anterior chest wall
and no fluid collection is identified.
.
TTE [**10-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. No
discrete vegetation identified (does not exclude). Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-23**], the distal
inferior wall is now hypokinetic (may be related to image
quality). The severity of mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
regurgitation are now increased.
.
CT ABD/PELVIS [**10-19**]:
1. No evidence of free air. Oral contrast has reached the
transverse colon, with no evidence of extraluminal contrast up
to this level. Fat stranding at the duodenum of uncertain
clinical significance. Free fluid in the pelvis and tracking in
the right lower abdominal quadrant. Anasarca.
2. Bilateral pleural effusion, more on the right with associated
atelectasis at the lung bases; cannot rule out superinfection.
.
EKG: [**10-18**] NSR @ 60 bpm, paced, prolonged PR interval, nl axis,
no acute ST changes, TWI, Qwaves (no change compared to prior on
[**2181-10-12**].
.
CXR [**2181-10-18**] (FINAL): Radiograph is limited due to rotation and
motion. There are bibasilar plate-like atelectasis. There is
opacty at the right lung base, which could be consolidation, and
correlation with clinical symptoms is recommended. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. Dual-lead pacer device is seen with leads in the
expected locations in the right atrium and right ventricle.
Bones are diffusely osteopenic. Atherosclerotic calcification
along the thoracic aorta is seen. Old right lower posterolateral
rib fracture is less conspicuous on the current radiograph.
IMPRESSION: Limited radiograph due to rotation and motion.
Possible airspace opacity at the right lung base, could be
consolidation, and correlation with clinical exam is
recommended.
.
TTE [**2181-5-23**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal
septum and anterior walls. The apex is akinetic. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2180-6-28**] the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
Regional left ventricular systolic function is similar.
.
Colonoscopy [**10-15**]
Normal mucosa in the whole colon
Polyp at a distance between 80 cm and 65 cm in the colon
Polyp at 20cm in the sigmoid colon (polypectomy)
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
.
Endoscopy [**10-11**]
Normal mucosa in the stomach (biopsy, biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
