History of Present Illness:
80 yo male with history of COPD on home oxygen, lung Cancer with
recent admission to [**Hospital1 **] [**2-6**] - [**2-13**] for recurrent LLL PNA with
effusion, treated for H. Flu PNA at the VA in [**12-19**] and had been
at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 21079**] Rehab for 2 days and today developed shortness of
breath, decreased oxygen saturation to 80% and RLQ pain, taken
to [**Location (un) 24356**] ED and then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. In the ED, the
patient was in moderate respiratory distress, 80% room air
oxygen saturation and was put on NRB with sats of 100%, ABG on
NRB was 7.24/87/139 and had RLQ fullness. The patient's repeat
gas was 7.29/74/50 and he was placed on 100% O2. He was initally
felt to have pulmonary edema and given 60mg Lasix IV prior to
arrival and placed on a nitro drip for 1 hour which was stopped
after his pressure decreased. The patient was placed on Bipap 3
hours after arrival however still had a PaO2 of 50. He was then
intubated for continued hypoxima. CT abd showed large rectus
sheath hematoma but not dissection or retroperitoneal bleeding.
He was given Levofloxacin and Flagyl for concern for PNA and
morphine for pain. He was also gien 2 mg Ativan, 100mcg of
Fentanyl, and Solumedrol 80mg.

Pertinent Results:
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: sbo, colitis, hernia
Field of view: 39 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old man with abdominal pain, distended abdomen
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
sbo, colitis, hernia
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 80-year-old with abdominal pain and a distended
abdomen with an abdominal wall mass, question incarcerated
hernia.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. No
oral contrast was used. 150 cc of Optiray was used for this
examination due to patient history of debility. Coronal and
sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

No prior studies for comparison.

CT ABDOMEN W/IV CONTRAST

There are moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, left
greater than right. Atelectatic changes are seen at both lung
bases. Bullous changes are also seen at the right lung base. The
liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals, and kidneys are unremarkable
in appearance. The left kidney demonstrates mild cortical
thinning. The gallbladder is not distended, but its wall appears
enhanced slightly. No free air, free fluid, or pathologic
lymphadenopathy is seen within the abdomen. The intra-abdominal
small bowel is normal in appearance. Numerous diverticula are
seen scattered throughout the colon without evidence of
diverticulitis.

The abdominal aorta is aneurysmal. Just inferior to the
diaphragmatic hiatus it measures 3.9 x 3.5 cm. It is largest in
diameter just inferior to the right renal vein at the level of
the left renal vein where it measures
4.2 x 4.3 cm. Mural thrombus and plaque are seen throughout the
aneurysm. There is a graft in place which begins just inferior
to the left renal artery and continues through the iliac
bifurcation into the common iliac arteries. The graft appears to
be a venous bypass type graft. Calcification is seen throughout
the intra-abdominal aorta. Dense calcification is seen at the
ostia of both the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries,
though contrast is seen within both of these arteries.

CT PELVIS W/IV CONTRAST

The rectum is distended with stool. Numerous sigmoid diverticula
are seen without evidence of diverticulitis. A Foley catheter is
seen within a partially collapsed bladder. There is a small
amount of air in the bladder secondary to the Foley catheter. As
stated above, there is a bypass graft in the abdominal aorta,
extending into the iliac arteries. The common iliac artery is
aneurysmal measuring 2.2 x 2.7 cm in maximal diameter. Mural
thrombus is seen within the common iliac artery. The right iliac
artery also is aneurysmal and is thrombosed measuring 2.2 x 2.4
cm in greatest diameter.

The soft tissues demonstrate an extensive hematoma within the
right rectus abdominis muscle and rectus sheath. This measures
roughly 3.2 x 7.9 cm in the axial dimension, and 12.4 cm in the
craniocaudad dimension. The osseous structures demonstrate
degenerative changes throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar
spine. There is a mild concavity of the superior endplate of the
L1 vertebral body.

Coronal and sagittal reformatted images significantly aided in
the evaluation of the above findings and confirmed the above
findings.

IMPRESSION
1. Extensive hematoma within the right rectus abdominis muscle
and rectus sheath as described above.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectatic
changes.
3. Extensive abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus. A
bypass graft is in place. Aneurysmal dilatation is also seen of
both right and left common iliac arteries. The right common
iliac artery aneurysm is thrombosed.
4. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

These findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at the
completion of the study.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o PNA

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old man with fever, recent pna with respiratory
distress.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PNA
HISTORY: Fever, respiratory distress.

REFERENCE EXAM: [**2-8**].

FINDINGS:

The extreme right CP angle is off the film. There continues to
be obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with left
lower lobe volume loss with or without infiltrate and effusion.
Incidental note is again made of an azygous lobe. Compared to
the film from [**2-8**], there has been no significant interval
change.
