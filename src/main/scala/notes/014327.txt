Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, admitted for ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. ERCP
2.  Biliary bypass (choledochal duodenostomy).
3.  Open cholecystectomy.
4.  Extensive adhesiolysis.


History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:  Pt is a 70 year old woman with a
PMHx significant for CBD stones and strictures and stents
admitted for abdominal pain and planned ERCP. For the past 2
weeks she has not felt well with increased abdominal pain, worse
after meals. No bloody stools. No N/V. She has been constipated
intermittently. She describes the pain as sharp, and localizes
it to her epigastric region.  She had fevers to 101 at home with
chills.  She was taken by her daughter to [**Hospital3 **] where
she had rigors and a temp of 99.  Her WBCs were found to be
22,000. Creat was slightly elevated at 1.4 in the setting of
presumed dehydration. T Bili was 0.26 and LFTs were nl except
for Alk Phos elevated to 139. She was given Levo and Flagyl and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP planned for tomorrow.
.
As for her CBD history, she underwent ERCP and stenting in
[**Month (only) 1096**] in [**State 4565**] initially for acute CBD obstruction.
Then she had more symptoms and underwent an ERCP in [**Month (only) 958**] of
this year and the CBD was dilated with a suggestion of a filling
defect or a stricture in its distal portion on initial
cholangiogram and a villious like polyp was found in the distal
CBD which corresponded to the stricture on
cholangiogram/flouroscopy. This was biopsied and brushings were
also taken and was found to be negatice for malignant cells.  A
biliary stent was placed successfully in the in the CBD across
the stricture.  In [**Month (only) 547**], she had another ERCP with replacement
of the plastic stent with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] biliary stent after
baloon dilation.  Brushings from this ERCP yielded "atypical
ductal cells and atypical columnar cells in groups and singly.
While this may represent reactive changes, a neoplasm cannot be
entirely excluded."
.
In the ED she was given Vicodin and admitted.

ERCP BILIARY&PANCREAS BY GI UNIT  [**2165-7-24**] 3:26 PM
IMPRESSION: Large stricture in the distal part of common bile
duct with proximal dilatation of CBD.
.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2165-7-26**] 1:23 PM
IMPRESSION:

1. No CT signs of pancreatitis or pancreatic necrosis.

2. Pancreatic and intra-hepatic/extra-hepatic ductal dilatation.
Distended gallbladder without surrounding inflammatory changes
is likely related to NPO status, please correlate clinically.

3. Three-cm infrarenal aortic aneurysm with moderate amount of
atherosclerotic aortic disease and mural thrombus.

4. There is suggestion of interstitial lung disease. If
indicated clinically, HRCT could better differentiate dependent
changes from peripheral/basilar interstitial lung disease.

.

MRI ABDOMEN W/O & W/CONTRAST  [**2165-7-27**] 9:57 A

IMPRESSION:
1. Focal high-grade stenosis involving the proximal celiac
artery without obvious collateral formation (similar in
appearance to recent CT). Remaining mesenteric vasculature is
widely patent.

2. Infrarenal abdominal aorta demonstrates fusiform dilation,
atherosclerosis, and eccentric thrombus, unchanged.

3. Circumferential low T2 signal surrounding the distal common
bile duct in the region of the patient's known CBD stent, likely
associated with the stenosis in this region. Diffuse mild main
pancreatic duct dilatation is unchanged.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2165-8-1**]
 Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
0-5mmHg. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of
the basal
septum. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior/inferolateral
akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
