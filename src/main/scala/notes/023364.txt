Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2140-1-19**] and, later that day, was
taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for L TKA without
complication.  Please see operative report for details.
Postoperatively the patient did well.  The patient was initially
treated with a PCA followed by PO pain medications on POD#1.
The patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours
postoperatively, as well as lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting
on the morning of POD#1.  The patient was placed in a CPM
machine with range of motion that started at 0-45 degrees of
flexion before being increased to 90 degrees as tolerated.  The
drain was removed without incident on POD#1. She had respiratory
distress and her oxygen saturations dropped into the 80s.  She
was transferred to the MICU and was stabilized on CPAP.  The
Foley catheter was removed without incident on POD 2. The
surgical dressing was removed on POD#2 and the surgical incision
was found to be clean, dry, and intact without erythema or
purulent drainage.  She received 2 units PRBC on POD 2 for a HCT
of 20.  She was asymptomatic.

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was
afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was
stable, and the patient's pain was adequately controlled on a PO
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and
the wound was benign. The patient was discharged to home with
services or rehabilitation in a stable condition.  The patient's
weight-bearing status was WBAT.  The patient is to continue
using the CPM machine advancing as tolerated to 0-100 degrees.
MICU COURSE [**Date range (3) 51185**]

# Hypoxia: Pt was noted to hypoxic off of CPAP in the PACU
following Lt total knee replacement. Portable chest x-ray in the
PACU notable for vessel cephalization. In the OR and PACU she
received a total fluid load of 1.3L, pt was give a total of 30mg
Furosemide for which she put out a vast amount of urine although
interestingly enough her oxygenation failed to improve.
Differential negative pressure pulmonary edema as pt has not
history of cardiac dysfunction and did not receive a vast amount
of fluid in the OR.  Treated with albuterol nebs.  BNP 65.
Cardiac biomarkers flat.  Continued CPAP.  Improved to 2L nc.

# Anemia: Pot-op hct noted to be 6 points lower than her pre-op
Hct, pt's EBL noted to be minimal per surgery, pt also only
received 1.3L in the OR.   No signs/symptoms of bleeding.

#. Leukocytosis: WBC noted to be elevated, however pt was
post-op which likely explains WBC elevation. Pt currently on
Cefazolin post-operatively.  Cultures negative thus far.

#. Diabetes: Oral medications held as patient was not eating and
patient in acute renal failure.  Covered with SSI.  Lisinopril
held.

#. S/p Total Knee replacement: Pt is s/p Lt TKR for
osteoarthritis, currently on a Dilaudid PCA, placed in brace
with hemovac drain in place. Pt also on Cefazolin post op.
Continued PCA. D/c'ed ketorolac given acute renal failure.
Lovenox d/c'ed given acute renal failure and patient started on
heparin sq tid for DVT ppx.

#. Acute Renal Failure on Chronic Renal Insufficeny: Pt's
Creatinine elevated to 1.6, over past few months pt's Creatinine
has been elevated 1.3. Diabetes medications and lisinopril as
above.

#. HTN: Pt has a history of HTN, currently SBP have ranged in
the low 100s. Will hold Lisinopril and HCTZ as pt's Creatinine

elevated at 1.6.

upon discharge.
