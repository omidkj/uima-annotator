Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD
who presents today with worsening shortness of breath.  She was
at her nursing home where she was found to have altered mental
status and wasn't responding to much stimuli.  She had an O2 sat
in the 80s per report.  She had no other significant ROS
history, including no recent fevers, chills, falls or other
complaints.  She is unresponsive on initial interview, so more
information cannot be obtained.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.4, P 116, BP 112/69, R 26,
100% on 4L.  On exam in the ED, she was tachypneic with labored
breathing, tachycardic to the 120s-130s, hypotensive with SBPs
in the 90s, and non-responsive.  She received methylprednisone
125 mg IV x1, levoflox x1, zosyn x1 and lasix 40 mg x1.  She
also received albuterol nebs.  CXR was consistent with fluid
overload and possible R sided infiltrate.  Head CT was negative.
 She was placed on bipap and appeared more comfortable.  She
then started to become more responsive.  A conversation between
the daughter, the [**Name (NI) **] attending and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] occured and the
patient was made DNR/DNI.
.
On the floor, she is comfortable on bipap, opens her eyes to
painful stimuli and sometimes to voice, but no consistently.
ROS could not be obtained.

CT head [**2121-2-11**]:
FINDINGS: Evaluation is slightly limited by motion. There is no
acute
intracranial hemorrhage, large areas of edema, large masses or
mass effect.
There is preservation of normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation. Prominence
of the ventricles and sulci is likely due to age-related
parenchymal atrophy
and is unchanged since the previous study. Periventricular white
matter
hypodensities are unchanged and consistent with chronic small
vessel ischemic
disease. Evaluation of the paranasal sinuses is somewhat limited
by motion
artifact. However, there appears to be some mild mucosal
thickening of the
ethmoid air cells and possibly secretions, similar in extent
since the
previous study. The mastoid air cells are clear.
 Impression: No acute intracranial process.

Chest X ray [**2121-2-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Likely low lung volumes result in the
gross
appearance; however, mild edema with possibly consolidation
versus mass versus
adenopathy at the right hilum cannot be excluded. If clinically
feasible,
consider PA and lateral views in the radiology suite for
improved sensitivity.

Chest X ray [**2121-2-13**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly, unchanged retrocardiac
atelectasis.
Unchanged increase in diameter of the more central pulmonary
vessels that
suggest mild overhydration. No newly appeared focal parenchymal
opacities
suggesting pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of Breath--Chest X-ray on admission was suggestive
of fluid overload vs/ infiltrate. She was originally on bipap.
BNP was elevated (33,274) and thus she was aggressively diuresed
for goal 1L negative daily and eventually weaned to nasal
canula. Subsequent chest X-rays began to clear and follow-up BNP
was around 22,000. Cardiac enzymes were cycled and remained flat
at 0.03-0.05. She was treated with vancomycin and zosyn for
p
