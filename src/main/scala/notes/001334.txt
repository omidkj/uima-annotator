presented with continued angina and had a positive exercise
treadmill test.  Cardiac catheterization showed an ejection
fraction of 70%.  The left internal mammary coronary artery
to left anterior descending coronary artery graft was patent.
Previous vein grafts were occluded.  The patient was
scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Status post coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2138**].  2.  Status post re-do coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2149**].  3.  Hypercholesterolemia.  4.  Hypoglycemia.
5.  Status post ear surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

Lipitor 20 mg po q day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, pulse 74 regular rate and
rhythm.  Blood pressure 128/68.  Respiratory rate 22.   Room
air oxygen saturation 98%.  Weight 170 pounds.  This is a
well appearing 65 year-old male in no acute distress.  Skin
without lesions or rashes.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is
supple.  Chest lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart S1 and S2 regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are warm and well
profuse with trace pedal edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 7.7, hematocrit
42.6, platelet count 159, sodium 143, potassium 4.5, chloride
106, bicarb 27, BUN 13, creatinine 1.1.  Electrocardiogram
showed normal sinus rhythm with borderline IZCD.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was taken to the Operating Room
by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**2159-9-17**] for a coronary artery bypass
graft times three, radial artery to obtuse marginal,
saphenous vein graft to diagonal and saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending coronary artery.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.
The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation and
extubated on postoperative day number one.  The patient
required neosinephrine and fusion to maintain adequate blood
pressure.  The patient was also maintained on a nitroglycerin
drip for the radial artery graft.  Neosinephrine was weaned
to off by postoperative day number three.  The patient was
able to maintain adequate blood pressure.  The patient
remained in the Intensive Care Unit requiring aggressive
pulmonary toilet for what was thought to be an upper
respiratory infection or bronchitis.  Sputum cultures from
[**9-19**] showed only oropharyngeal flora.  Chest x-ray showed
right lower lobe atelectasis and small left effusion.  No
identifiable infiltrate.  The patient was started on Levaquin
for presumed bronchitis.  The patient had reported being on
antibiotics for bronchitis prior to entering the hospital.

The patient was requiring around the clock nebulizer
treatments with Albuterol and Atrovent as well as humidified
O2 and aggressive chest physical therapy.  The patient's
coughing and sputum production gradually subsided as O2
requirement decreased and the patient was transferred out of
the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day number four.
The patient continued to require aggressive pulmonary toilet
with around the clock nebulizer treatments.  The patient
remained afebrile during this time.  The patient's white
blood cell count rose to high of 14.7 on postoperative number
two, but quickly returned to [**Location 213**] by postoperative number
four.  By postoperative number seven the patient was weaned
from nasal cannula.  The patient was ambulating 500 feet and
climbing stairs with physical therapy on room air tolerating
activity well.  On postoperative day number eight the patient
was cleared for discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature max 98.2.  Pulse 80
sinus rhythm with frequent premature atrial contractions.
Blood pressure 116/60.  Respiratory rate 20.  Room air oxygen
saturation 98%.  Weight 78.4 kilograms.  Neurological intact.
Cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm without rub or murmur.
Respiratory breath sounds clear bilaterally, moderately
productive cough for yellow sputum.  Gastrointestinal,
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended,
tolerating a regular diet although with decreased appetite.
Sternal incision is clean and dry without drainage or
erythema.  Sternum is stable.  Left radial artery graft
harvest site is clean and dry with minimal erythema.  No
drainage.  Saphenectomy sites are clean and dry without
erythema.  Electrocardiogram on [**2159-9-25**] showed sinus
arrhythmia with a right bundle branch block.  Chest x-ray
from [**2159-9-21**] showed small bilateral effusions with right
lower lobe atelectasis.

LABORATORY ON DISCHARGE:  White blood cell count 10.6,
hematocrit 31.5, platelet count 244, sodium 136, potassium
4.8, chloride 99, bicarb 29, BUN 26, creatinine 0.9.

The patient is to be discharged to home in stable condition.

1.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft second re-do.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft [**2138**].
3.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft [**2149**].
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Hyperglycemia.
