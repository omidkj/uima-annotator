STUDIES & IMAGING OF INTEREST:
.
CTA [**2119-7-24**]: 1. No PE or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Diffuse full-length circumferential esophageal wall
thickening, likely
indicating esophagitis; however, of unknown etiology.
3. Tracheal abnormality previously noted is no longer present.
The lumen is
patent with no endoluminal lesions noted.
4. Dystrophic calcification in the right breast and fibrotic
changes in the
anterior right lung are stable and presumed related to prior
radiation.
5. Coronary artery disease and cardiomegaly.
6. Ovoid fluid collections around the urethra at the base of the
bladder.
These are stable since at least [**2117-3-19**] and may represent small
urethral
diverticulae. Correlate clinically.
7. Subacute vs. chronic ununited lateral right seventh rib
fracture.
.
ECHO [**2119-7-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. with
normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CTA [**2119-7-29**]: 1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic
pathology. 2. Patchy opacities involving both lungs could
reflect edema given the relative rapid onset, but fulminant
pulmonary infection or toxicity from new medication should also
be considered.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20893**] is a 62 y/o female with a history of breast cancer,
tracheal cancer and lung cancer (currenlty being treated with
chemo and radiation), and hypertension who presented with a 5
day history of nausea, vomiting a poor PO intake.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation: This appears to be new onset afib for
patient however she is asymptomatic with rapid heart rates. Her
CHADS score is 1 with hypertension. Precipitating factors
include volume depletion, infection and increased pain.
Echocardiography shopwd reduced EF of 45% with mild global
hypokensis consistent with cardiomyocte injury secondary to
hypotension.  She was repleted with fluids.  Her rate was
initially controlled on diltiazem; following spontaneous
cardioversion to sinus rhythem, she was transitioned first to PO
metoprolol, and then also her home medications lisinopril and
amlodipine.  Due to low CHADS would not start coumadin for
anticoagulation, patient also noted to have an aspirin allergy.
.
# Nausea/Vomiting: The most likely etiology includes
chemotherapy and radiation. She notes that her symptoms came on
after her recent dose of radiation.  Her nausea was controlled
with PRN ondansetron adn she was given fluids for rehydration;
and her appetite returned and nausea was well controlled.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis: She presented with anion gap metabolic
acidosis.  The most likely source of her acidosis includes
ketoacidosis from starvation. Her lactic acid was noted to be
normal therefore less likely. Following fluid resuscitation, her
acidosis resolved.
.
# Tracheal
