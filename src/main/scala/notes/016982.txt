HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 86 year old
man with diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency,
biliary cirrhosis, with a recent upper gastrointestinal bleed
from multiple duodenal ulcers seen on endoscopy two weeks
prior to admission.  The patient presented with worsening of
his baseline epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting of coffee
grounds.  The patient was assessed in the Emergency Room and
underwent CT scan which showed free air in the area of the
second portion of the duodenum along with a large amount of
free air and ascites.

Because of the patient's significant co-morbid conditions
along with peritoneal signs and free air, the options were
discussed and the decision was made to admit the patient and
proceed with an operation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was taken to an Operating Room
on [**2165-8-26**], where exploratory laparotomy and suture repair
of perforated duodenal ulcer, gastrostomy and feeding
jejunostomy was performed.  The operation was complicated by
diffuse oozing from the liver surface, a large amount of
ascitic fluid which was drained, proximal atrial
fibrillation, rate controlled, and a couple of episodes of
hypertension down to 60 which resolved promptly.

At the end of the operation, the patient was hemodynamically
stable and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit,
intubated.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient remained hypotensive,
dropping his mean arterial pressure down to the 40s.  He was
started on Levophed.  Throughout his admission, we were not
able to wean patient off Levophed.  He, in a matter of fact,
required increasing doses of Levophed to keep his mean
arterial pressure above 60.

A Cardiology consultation was also obtained which agreed with
the management already provided.  The patient was tried on
digoxin which did not improve his condition and we were still
not able to wean him off of Levophed.  Throughout his
admission, the patient remained in rate controlled atrial
fibrillation with heart rate between 70 and 120.

2.  Respiratory:  Postoperatively, when it was clear that the
patient will require a long term ventilator support, his
intubation was converted to tracheostomy.  He eventually
progressed from CIMV to [**Hospital1 **]-C-PAP which he tolerated well
throughout his admission with only small amounts of yellow
secretion that came out of his tracheostomy tube.  The
patient's saturation remained good.

3.  Renal:  The patient's chronic renal failure got worse
after the operation.  His creatinine increased between 2.5
and 3.5.  The patient eventually became aneuric, required
hemodynamically.  However, sessions were frequently
interrupted because of the patient's hypotension.  Throughout
his admission his renal status has not improved.  The patient
remained aneuric with a high creatinine.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a G-tube and J-tube
placed interoperatively.  He was very quickly times two.  His
goal tube feeds which he remained throughout his admission
resolved any complications.  No gastrointestinal bleeds.

The patient's primary biliary cirrhosis is probably
contributing significantly to his multiple system failure.

6.  Endocrine:  Throughout his admission, the patient
required an insulin drip.  All attempts to wean him off
resulted in the patient's blood sugars staying above 200.

7.  Hematology:  The patient remained thrombocytopenic
throughout his admission with platelet level less than 100,
but he did not have any active episodes of bleeding as
indicted above.  The patient required red blood cell
transfusion intermittently to improve his hematocrit.

8.  Infectious Disease:  The patient grew Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus out of his sputum culture in
the beginning of his postoperative course.  He was placed on
Vancomycin on which he remained throughout that admission.
All cultures were negative.

9.  Wound:  Clean, dry and intact.

10. Neurological:  After the patient's sedation was weaned
off, he was a alert, oriented, pain free, responding
appropriately to the environment, following commands and
answering questions.

DISPOSITION:   During the course of his admission, the
patient's status was changed to "Do Not Resuscitate" "Do Not
Intubate".

On [**9-28**], a family meeting was held with members of the
following teams present.  Due to lack of progress in the
patient's recovery and worsening of his cardiovascular and
renal status, the decision was made to change the patient's
status to comfort measures only.  His Levophed dosing was cut
in half which resulted in immediate drop in his mean arterial
pressure.  The patient was started on a morphine drip on
comfort measures and expired in the morning of [**2165-9-29**], with patient's family present.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Perforated duodenal ulcer.
2.  Gastrointestinal bleed status post repair.
3.  Heart failure.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
5.  Tracheostomy dependent.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
8.  Acute renal failure.
9.  Biliary cirrhosis.
