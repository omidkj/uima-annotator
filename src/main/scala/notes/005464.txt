TTE [**2189-12-20**]
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent
foramen ovale is present. A right-to-left shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending
aorta. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is no pericardial
effusion.
POST CPB:
1. Improved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function EF = 55%,
2. No change in valve syructure and function.
3. Intact aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of coronary artery
disease and surgical
revascularization. He was brought to the Operating Room on
[**2189-12-17**] where he underwent urgent coronary artery bypass graft
x5: (Left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending
artery and saphenous vein grafts to diagonal, ramus, obtuse
marginal and right coronary arteries). Overall the patient
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.

On the first post operative night he spiked to a temperature to
103 and experienced rigors. He was continued on periop
antibiotics and pan cultured. All cultures were no growth to
date at the time of discharge.

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably. He experienced several periods of apnea
on post operative night requiring BIPAP. He will need an
outpatient sleep study to evaluate for OSA. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and titrated
for better blood pressure control. The patient was gently
diuresed toward his preoperative weight. The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.

His preoperative Lantus and Metformin were restarted. He had
good blood sugar control in house and these medications are to
be titrated  by his primary care physician as an outpatient
(HbA1C 11.1% preoperatively).  The patient was evaluated by the
Physical Therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was
ambulating well, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with
visiting nurse services in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions.
