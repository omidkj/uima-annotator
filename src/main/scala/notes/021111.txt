Past Medical History:
Oncologic History:
She presented with elevated white cell count with a monocytosis,
fever, diarrhea, and nausea. Bone marrow biopsy done on
[**2194-8-8**] was consistent with CML. Cytogenetics indicated a
translocation of chromosomes 9 and 12, BCR-ABL translocation.
Monocytosis resolved on its own. She began on Gleevec 400 mg per
day on [**2194-9-2**].

Pertinent Results:
Microbiology:
Blood Culture [**3-7**], Routine (Preliminary):
      SENT TO [**Hospital1 4534**] [**2195-3-12**].
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S) finalized as Leptotrichia trevosani

      MEROPENEM = .023 MCG/ML.
      CEFTRIAXONE = .38 MCG/ML.

CSF:

Initial Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2195-2-25**]:
B cells comprise 13% of lymphoid gated events, are polyclonal,
and do not express aberrant antigens. Cell marker analysis
demonstrates that the majority of the cells within the blasts
gate isolated from this peripheral blood express CD33, lymphoid
associated antigens CD10 (dim), and are negative for TdT, CD19.
Blast cells comprise 16% of total events.

Day 14 Marrow Biopsy [**2195-3-13**]:
A majority of the analyzed events are in the cell debris/lysed
cell area. No clear CD34-immunoreactive blast population is
identified, gating on this region.

Sinus Biopsy [**2195-3-12**]:
A.  Right inferior turbinate:
1.  Sinonasal mucosa with chronic inflammation.
2.  No fungal forms seen on PAS and GMS stains.

B.  Left inferior turbinate:
1.  Sinonasal mucosa with chronic inflammation.
2.  No fungal forms seen on PAS and GMS stains.

Endoscopy [**2195-3-12**]:
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear
Erythema and congestion in the stomach
Normal mucosa in the first part of the duodenum and second part
of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 25067**] was admitted to the hospital with nausea and vomiting,
fever and flushing concerned for a wide differential diagnoses.
During her work up, a bone marrow biopsy displayed acute blast
crisis from her chronic myelogenous leukemia.  Initial
immunophenotyping suggested biphenotypic blast crisis.  She was
treated presumptively for Strongyloides with Ivermectin x2 days
given her travel history & country of origin, prior to
initiating chemotherapy.  In addition, her PPD turned positive
and review of her chest CT suggested old Tuberculosis.
Treatment was deferred per ID until the chemotherapy effects on
her liver could be evaluated.

The patient was started on HyperCVAD with intrathecal
Methotrexate and dasatinib.  The day after Hyper-CVAD initiation
repeat/further immunophenotyping revealed that it was in fact a
myleoblastic crisis.  She was switched to 7+3 induction regimen
without dasatinib.  The patient's course was complicated by
neutropenia and intermittent fever, later found to be due to GNR
bacteremia and PNA. Cultures finalized as Leptortrichia. Patient
was treated with broad spectrum antimicrobials including
Meropenem, Vancomycin, Flagyl, Micafungin and Acylovir.  Her
hickmann line was removed and replaced with a PICC. She was
treated with IV antibiotics until her counts recovered and she
was afebrile. She was discharged on oral flagyl as this bacteria
usually is susceptible to this antibiotic per case reports. She
will complete a two weeek course as an outpatient. Chest CT
revealed improvement of her pneumonia. In addition, the patient
developed intractable nausea and vomiting, which, poorly
controlled, led ultimately to hematemesis found to be due to
[**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tears. On return from the ICU, the patient's
nausea was well controlled on PPI, Zofran, Zyprexa.  She had no
more episodes of hematemesis but continued to have fevers and
neutropenia. Fevers abated and counts recovered. Decision was
made for patient to complete antibiotics as outpatient for two
week course of po flagyl and return for transplant. She will
restart destanib as an outpatient. Counts will be checked two
days post-discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You have been admitted for fever and nausea found to be a
conversion of your Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia into an acute
"blast crisis."  While you were here you underwent chemotherapy
which was complicated by nausea and vomiting.  After a brief
transfer to the ICU you returned to the floor and did well. You
were found to have a bacteria in your blood and will need to
continue to take antibiotics through [**2195-4-12**]. Please come back
