Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, Cough and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
54 y/oM with HIV on HAART (viral load undetectable, last CD4 in
[**3-11**] 374), stage IV squamous lung CA s/p RUL s/p lobectomy,
chemo/XRT, local and distal recurrence, HCV who p/w worsening
fatigue, weakness, increasing dyspnea and new pleuritic chest
pain.
.
Pt. was in USOH (able to ambulate on flat ground ~ 1mi w/o DOE,
independent in majority of ADLs) until ~ 1wk ago when he
develped malaise and fatigue. Over the next few days he
developed a dry cough, which by 3 days PTA became productive of
yellow/green sputum. At the same time he developed left sided
pleuritic chest pain. He never had subjective fevers or chills,
no nightsweats, though had ~ 10-12lbs of wt loss over the past
month. By 2 days PTA, his dyspnea had worsened to the point that
he was unable to perform ADLs and required assisstance from his
mother. [**Name (NI) **] has had weakness in RUE and has had difficulty using
that arm, but this is unchanged from prior. Has not been exposed
to anyone with RFs for TB, no recent travel. Has not skipped any
of the [**Doctor Last Name **] meds. He had respiratory distress requiring
intubation for hypoxemic failure in [**2194**] after his right
thoracotomy and right upper lobectomy.
In the ED initial VS were 97.9 82 116/79 16 he desaturated to
88% on RA, increased to 93% with 2L NC. CTA showed a small LLL
PNA with no evidence of PE, and enlarging right apical tumor.
Blood cultures were drawn and was treated with zosyn, bactrim,
vancomycin. He was admitted to the floor and had a slowly
increasing O2 requirement to the point that this AM was satting
86% on 6L NC, requiring an NRB. He became more confused and
sleepy per nursing staff. MICU evaluation was initiated.
On evaluation, VS were 99.8F 106/72 88 26 93% on NRB, using
accessory muscles of respiration and nasal flaring and
tachypneic. STAT ABG was pH 7.40 pCO2 50 pO2 67, which was
essentially unchanged from the one prior. He c/o of SOB and
appeared slightly sleepy, though arousable to voice.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, chronic weakness and tingling in right arm,
otherwise negative in detail.

FINDINGS: Portable AP upright view of the chest is obtained.
Post-surgical
changes related to prior right upper thoracotomy and
reconstruction as well as
right upper lobectomy are again noted. There is subtle increased
nodular
opacity at the left lung base, which raises concern for
pneumonia. No large
pleural effusions are seen, though the right CP angle is
excluded.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable. Left
humeral head
prosthesis is noted.
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for left basilar pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] was a 54 yo man with HIV on HAART (viral load
undetectable, last CD4 in [**3-11**] 374), stage IV squamous lung CA
s/p RUL s/p lobectomy, chemo/XRT, local and distal recurrence,
HCV who presented with worsening fatigue, weakness, increasing
dyspnea, new pleuritic chest pain, sputum production and
confusion.
.
# Stage IV lung CA: On presentation, Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] had an apical
mass expanding, adrenal mass on CTA suspicious for metastasis
and radicular symptoms in right arm likely [**1-3**] nerve compression
but per Pain Clinic. On hospital day six, Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**] reported
significnt concern over a new foot drop on the right which
progressed to include right leg paralysis and numbness. An MRI
of the Spine revealed metastatic tumor cord compression at C7 to
T3 with significant stenosis at T2. Neuro-Surgery determined
that he was a poor surgical candidate because of the extensive
surgical debridment required or and high-risk nature of the
surgery. Radiation Oncology evaluated him and determined that
re-radiation was unlikely to improve his symptoms because of
poor tumor response in the past. Pain control was maintined and
he with his mother decided that inpatient hospice with a change
of code status to DNR/DNI would be best for Mr. [**Known lastname 28145**].
.
# HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC - He was found to have a
LLL consolodation consistent with a LLL pneumonia. The pneumonia
was believed to be aspiration vs. CAP and sputum culture failed
to identify a pathogen. He recieved 7 days of imperic antibotics
with azithromycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl which seemed to have
resolved the pneumonia, but he continued to [**Known lastname 28148**]
difficulty oxygenating. A PE was ruled out w/ CTA. And a Bubble
study and Echo did not further identifying cause of hypoxia. He
was aided by albuterol nebs Q2 hours and ipratropium nebs Q6H
PRN. In the setting of his lobectomy and recurrent
