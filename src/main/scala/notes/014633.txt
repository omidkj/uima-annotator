Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo F with history of hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism
who presents with nausea and vomiting with severe hyponatremia.

.
# Hyponatremia: The etiology of the patient's severe
hyponatremia was likely multifactorial given her recent paxil
reinitiation, HCTZ, possible pulmonary infection, macrolide use
and pain secondary to her left wrist fracture.  Most likely
cause is SIADH.  She did have a normal TSH. During her course in
the ICU, she was given hypertonic saline based on weight with
good effect and had her free water intake restricted to 1200cc
per day.  She was transferred to the regular floor after having
stable sodium of around 126 on her third hospital day. During
her hospital course for her hyponatremia, renal specialists
evaluated her and recommended the above treatment as well
discharging on her on a free water restriction of 1200 cc per
day.  She will need to follow up with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2204**] 1 to
2 days after her discharge so that her serum sodium level may be
evaluated.

# Wrist fracture: History of wrist fracture with new deformation
of the volar plate. She was evaluated by plastic surgery,
received a wrist splint and has outpatient follow up scheduled
for this condition.

# Bronchitis/pneumonia: She initially presented to the hospital
with cough and rhonchorous breath sounds on exam and possible
radiological evidence suggestive of pulmonary infection.
Treated empirically with 5 day course of levofloxacin with
respiratory symptoms and signs negative on day of discharge.

# Benzodiazepine usage: There was initial concern for possible
excessive benzo use at home so pt was wrtitten for CIWA which
was not required.

# Hypertension: Patient's HCTZ was held during course and listed
as allergy.  She had her home [**Last Name (un) **] restarted to better control
her HTN, however her discharge blood pressure require her to be
evaluated for other anti hypertensives medication to be control
her BP.

# Hypothyroidism/hypoparathyroidism: she was continued on her
home dose of levothyroxine and given home dose of Vit D.
