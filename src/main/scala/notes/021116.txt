Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer with severe shortness of breath, fever, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP, deep suctioning, chest physical therapy

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, patient is a 79 year old male with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG
in [**2121**], COPD (no PFTs available), HTN, Afib, PVD s/p
aortofemoral
bypass who presents from [**Hospital1 **] with shortness of
breath. Patient has had multiple episodes of aspiration
pneumonia (including MSSA PNA) in the past 8 months. Wife states
he had been doing well after his last discharge on [**2140-1-1**], had
gone to rehab on antibiotics; his last dose of Vanc/Zosyn was on
[**2140-1-4**]. The patient's wife reports that 2 days PTA the patient
developed a poor appetite and shallow breathing. On the day of
admission, per report the patient was clearly tachypneic, and
was found to have a temp of 101.1. He was placed on BIPAP 12/5
with 5L of O2. An ABG was performed, which came back as
7.406/43/80/32. The patient was given 1 dose of ceftaz and sent
to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED the patient was again placed on BiPAP. His SpO2
remained in the 80s with a respiratory rate approaching 40
breaths per minute. He appeared somnolent. In the ED he received
a 200 cc bolus of NS and was given Levofloxacin, Flagyl,
Vancomycin. A MICU evaluation was called, and the patient was
admitted to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, the patient was treated with vancomycin and zosyn,
as well as frequent neb treatments and steroids. He responded
well to this regimen, and no intubation was required. BiPAP was
not tolerated well, but the patient was found to be oxygenating
and ventilating fairly well on FM + NC. The patient was found to
have a left sided white-out on CXR, for which chest PT has been
attempted with some improvement in O2 sats.
.
The patient was recently admitted from [**2139-12-25**] to [**2140-1-1**] for
PNA. He was intubeted for 2 days after which he was extubated
and placed on nocturnal BIPAP. He has a baseline O2 requirement
of 3L by NC.

CXR [**1-13**]: Patient's head obscures evaluation of the left upper
lung. The patient is status post median sternotomy. As compared
to the prior study, the mid and lower left lung zones
demonstrate increased opacity. Opacity in the right lower lobe
not as prominent as on the prior study. The right apical opacity
appears stable. A small left pleural effusion is present. Lungs
[**Location (un) 381**] lung volumes, but given this limitation, there is no
definite pulmonary edema.
.
CXR [**1-15**]: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax
with faint central air bronchograms; this represents a marked
change within the last two days. There is no significant
mediastinal shift. The right lung is clear. Findings of prior
CABG (mediastinal clips and sternal wires) have been discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] on [**2140-1-15**].
.
CXR [**1-16**]: Median sternotomy wires are seen, unchanged. There has
been improvement of the opacification of the left lung. There
are areas of improved aeration in the left upper lobe. There is
complete opacification of the left lower lung field. There
remain areas of consolidation within the left upper lobe. There
is a pleural-based opacity seen within the right apex, which is
unchanged. There is blunting of the right CP angle. Assessment
of heart size is difficult secondary to the left lung
opacification.
.
EKG [**1-15**]:
Atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response
Premature ventricular contractions
Right bundle branch block
Possible inferior infarct - age undetermined
Since previous tracing of [**2140-1-13**], Q waves in inferior leads
more prominent


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU for intensive noninvasive
respiratory therapy, includid BiPAP, chest PT, frequent
nebulizer treatment, IV solumedrol, and antibiotic therapy with
vancomycin and zosyn.  It was thought that the patient likely
had suffered a repeat aspiration event leading to a new
aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis, as well as a likely
exacerbation of his baseline COPD, which likely occurred in the
setting of this pneumonia.  The patient symptomatically improved
greatly on this regimen.  He did not tolerate BiPAP well, but he
did manage to oxygenate and ventilate well on facemask with
frequent nebulizer treatments.  His mental status quickly
improved as well.  He did suffer a near white-out of the left
lung on [**1-15**], even as he was improving clinically.  This was
most likely due to mucus plugging, and left lung aeration
improved with turning of the patient and intensive chest PT.
The patient was transferred to the general medical floor on
[**2140-1-16**] in stable condition.  He was continued on the frequent
neb treatments, PO prednisone, and IV vancomycin and zosyn.  The
patient was kept NPO due to his aspiration risk.  He was satting
well on 2L by NC in the evening of [**1-16**].  The patient's
anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation was discontinued during
his stay in the ICU.  During the MICU stay, a family meeting was
held to discuss the chronic aspiration problems of the patient.
The patient did not want to have a feeding tube inserted, and
was interested in eating, even though he knew that he would
likely aspirate again eventually.  During this discussion, the
patient was made DNR/DNI.
.
Late in the night on [**1-16**] the patient was found to be
bradycardic to 39 on routine vital signs check.  He was
asymptomatic during this episode, and normotensive.  Nursing
requested that the patient be placed on telemetry for closer
monitoring.  Later in the night the patient was found to have an
8 second asystolic pause, again reported as asymptomatic.  The
covering physician came to the bedside on hearing of this event,
and found the patient to be in PEA arrest, which converted to
asystole.  No invasive interventions were performed, in keeping
with the DNR/DNI order.  The patient expired at 3:30AM on
[**2140-1-17**].
