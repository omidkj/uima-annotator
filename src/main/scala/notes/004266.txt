Hematemesis

History of Present Illness:
Admission information and pertinent hospital course:
84 year old male c DM, HTN, OA, afib not on coumadin, CKD stage
IV, Chronic CHF recently discharged [**Date range (1) 12474**] for R ankle pain
(resolved on own, no etiology) and mild heart failure
exacerbation, is readmitted on [**7-12**] for Chest pain. While in ED,
had episodes of hematemesis, thus was admitted to MICU.
As for chest pain: Pt reports experiencing a sharp, stabbing,
left sided CP started [**7-12**] am, on/off since that day.
Reproducible on exam. EKG unremarkable. Trops negative. Pain is
better today. Thought to be musculoskeletal with possible GI
component.
As for episode of hematemesis. Has chronic anemia, but recent
admission his hgb was lower than baseline ([**7-20**]) to 6.5,
hemeoccult neg, no obvious bleeding, got 2U. had no GI
complaints, was told to follow up. This admission, initially no
GI complaints other than chest pain. No melena, no further
hematemesis. NGL was performed in ER, and per report showed old
blood that cleared after 700 cc's. He was started on IV PPI and
transfered to MICU, where per notes, another NGL done, still old
blood, but easily cleared. NGT removed [**1-12**] nausea/discomfort.
Seen by GI. hgb and vitals have been stable, thus EGD defered to
[**7-15**] am. Over past couple days, has c/o intermitted
periumbilical/epigastric pain, but that has also resolved by
time of transfer to floor. He is tolerating clears. Of note, pt
with hematemesis approx 1 year ago. EGD at that time showed some
gastritis in the antrum. He was prescribed high dose PPI.
Also, while in ER, initially CXR with possible RLL PNA, started
on levaquin, no fevers/white count/cough.

Pertinent Results:
See below for 24hour Labs:
interpretation:
creat up from 2.9-->3.3-->3.1-->2.9 today  BUN stable 45-55
Hgb around 10.

Other labs:
Trops X2 unremarkable (0.08, 0.07), proBNP of 2312, and
urinalysis unremarkalbe. Blood cultures were also sent, ntd.
.
.
Imaging/results:
.
Echo: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF
=30-35%). The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
(2.2L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-7**],
biventricular systolic function is more depressed. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.
These findings are suggestive of an infiltrative process (e.g.,
amyloid).
.
.
EGD: normal esophagus, antral erythema and friability,
antral/fundus erosions, angioectasia, first part of duodenum

ECG [**7-12**]: Afib, good vent rate, frequent PVCs vs aberrantly
conducted beats.

.
.
Chest x-ray [**7-12**]:new RLL possible infiltrate
XRAY repeated [**7-13**] and [**7-14**] NO infiltrate
*has nonspecific RUL nodule, need f/u CT in few months (last
[**4-18**])
.
.
Echo: [**11-17**]: EF 45%, mod cLVH, no WMA
Cath '[**03**]: normal except 30% prox LCx.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSEMENT AND PLAN:
84year old male with a history of NICM and chronic HF, CKD stage
IV, DM on insulin, afib off coumadin, gastritis, admitted to
MICU [**7-12**] with chest pain and hematemesis, transfered to Gen Med
[**7-14**].  Underwent EGD, revealing gastritis, no further bleeding.
Protonix increased to [**Hospital1 **] for 4weeks, then back to qd. Aspirin
changed to EC 162mg qd. While on Med service, Low BP (80-90SBP)
and rising creatine limiting diuresis and NS holding
coreg/valsartan. Echo repeated, EF 35%, PE c/w volume overload
still, pt asymptomatic for low BP, thus meds reintroduced.  Now
is stable once again on home cardiac regimen. Doing well, ready
for discharge home today.

UGIB/hematemesis X1: h/o gastritis. hematemesis in ED and NGL
with old blood, but hgb here has been stable. No further
bleeding.
-EGD with gastritis c friable mucosa/erosions, no ulcers. Bx for
H.pylori sent (note, neg serologies in past)
-will place on on protonix [**Hospital1 **] X4weeks, then back to qd
-appreciate GI recs, also started on carafate
-should be on EC [**Hospital1 **], no NSAIDs
.
.
Chronic heart failure: NICM, systolic HF EF 45% 12/07, also has
diastolic dysfunction. Currently appears euvolemic to slightly
hypervolemi (though has slight crackles, elevated jvd, elevated
BNP). Unfortunately, fluid removal is limited by CKD. Echo
repeated [**7-16**] showing global drop in EF 35% (was 45% 12/07, 35%
6/07).
-did well on lasix 120mg [**Hospital1 **] yesterday, creat stable today. Will
continue at this dose and coreg 3.125mg [**Hospital1 **] and valsartan 40mg
qd (tolerated all three yesterday). He will have f/u Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**],
cards, on [**7-23**], at which time her creat should be rechecked.
-Also of note, echo suggestive of infiltrative process such as
amyloidosis, which can be seen in CKD patients. However, not
sure if further w/u would be of any significancea at this age.
.
.
CKD stage IV: creat baseline 2.6-2.9.  Again, tricky situation
in setting of fluid overload, will need to find regimen that
keeps him more or less euvolemic with stable creatinine.
Electrolytes otw stable.
-he seems to be doing well with lasix 120mg [**Hospital1 **], cont this dose
with outpt follow up
-cont Calcitriol for hyperpara
-cont Fe supp for AoCKD, consider epo as outpt, defer to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 7473**]
[**Name (STitle) 12475**] dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins, monitor uop
.
.
Periumbilical pain/epigastric pain: LFTs with elevated alk phos
and lipase. However symptoms resolved, tolerated clears
-RUQ US unremarkable, symptoms resolved.
.
Chest pain, atypical. Reproducible and ?GI related vs volume
related. ruled out with trops, unremarkable EKG, no sig CAD
(cath essentially normal [**2103**], except 30% prox LAD), so less
concern for ischemia.
-follow for now, has essentially resolved. tylenol prn
.
.
Diabetes- Levemir=>Glargine here
-cont 45U qdinner
-cont SSI
.
.
Atrial fibrillation - Rate well-controlled off coreg currenlty.
- unclear whether coumadin has been addressed but not issue
currently in setting of erosive gastritis. Can be readdressed
after 6w
