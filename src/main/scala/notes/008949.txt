History of Present Illness:
83 yo F with HTN, hyperlipidemia, and one week of bronchitis who
was at her baseline, until 2 hours PTA when she became acutely
confused and not ambulatory, and vomited. EMS was called.

In the ED, initial vs were:T 98 P 114 BP 146/113 R 29 90 O2 sat.
On physical exam, she was intermittently following commands. A
code stroke was called but patient was found to be more
inattentive and confused on exam and was not consistent with a
focal deficit. A CT head was negative for acute bleed. CXR
showed infiltrate, with question of aspiration.  Given concern
for aspiration during likely seizure event at home she was given
ceftriaxone 1gm, levofloxacin 750mg, and flagyl 500mg IV. Renal
was consulted and hypertonic saline was initiated. Cardiology
was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding defuse EKG changes and in setting of
underlying metabolic derrangements, feel not primary cardiac
etiology. She did receive an aspirin and 2gm of IV magnesium.
Urine and blood cultures were sent off.
At the time of transfer, VS HR 122 BP 140/83 RR 36.

On the floor, patient was unable to provide further details of
the events leading to presentation due to mental status change.
She denied pain.

Review of systems:
Unable to assess [**3-2**] mental status. Per daughter, no recent
fevers or chills. Dry cough x 1 week that was not responding to
azithromycin with poor po intake over the past few days. No
diarrhea or vomiting.

CXR:
PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. Airspace
consolidation is noted in the lower lobes bilaterally and in the
right upper lobe adjacent to the minor fissure. Findings are
compatible with multifocal pneumonia or possibly aspiration. No
large pleural effusions are detected.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. No pneumothorax is seen.
Bones are
diffusely demineralized.
  IMPRESSION:
  Multifocal pneumonia as described above.

No evidence of acute infarction.

EKG:  Sinus tach at 104, ST elevation V2-V4 vs. repolarization
changes, no change in aVR or inferiorly, no old for comparison.

[**2201-7-15**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION: Multifocal consolidation and alveolitis consistent
with
widespread pneumonia. This is not the usual pattern for
bacterial infection unless patient suffered widespread
aspiration. It suggests an atypical organism including
Legionella and mycoplasma.
Mild cardiomegaly predominantly left ventricular, with mild left
atrial
enlargement. Atherosclerotic coronary calcification
predominantly left main, anterior descending and circumflex
branches.
.
[**2201-7-15**] ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. A
small left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen
at rest c/w a very small secundum atrial septal defect. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction of the distal 2/3rds of the
left ventricle and an apical aneurysm. Basal segments contract
well. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There
are simple atheroma in the abdominal aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Extensive left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy or multivessel CAD. Right ventricular
focal dysfunction. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Increased PCWP. Small secundum type atrial septal defect with
left-to-right flow.
.
[**2201-7-18**] Abd U/S with doppler
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal hepatic echotexture, without a focal lesion.
2. Trace free fluid in the abdomen.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions, partially imaged.
4. Very limited Doppler evaluation of the liver and kidneys due
to
difficulties with positioning and patient's difficulties at
breath holding. However, grossly unremarkable Doppler evaluation
as detailed above.

     FINAL
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the apical 2/rds of the ventricle. Basal
segment contract relatively well (LVEF 30-35%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg).Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild to moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-7-15**],
global left ventricular systolic function is minimally improved.
The severity of mitral regurgitation has increased. The
remaining findings are similar (an atrial septal defect is not
seen on the current study, but the images were not as
comprehensive for this assessment and is unlikely to reflect a
true change).

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT Study Date of [**2201-7-20**] 5:15 PM
IMPRESSION: Within limitations of study, no evidence of DVT in
the left upper extremity. Soft tissue edema superior to AC
fossa.

CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2201-7-21**] 9:11 PM
CT CHEST: There is evidence of tracheal collapse, suggesting
trachomalacia
(2:19,20). There are focal areas of consolidation in the lungs,
in the right upper and middle lobe, and left upper lobe, which
are less prominent compared to CT chest and could represent foci
of pneumonia. There are bilateral pleural effusions, which have
increased in size compared to prior study, with bibasilar
consolidation, which could be atelectasis; however pneumonia
cannot be excluded. Evaluation is limited due to lack of IV
contrast administration. Ther
