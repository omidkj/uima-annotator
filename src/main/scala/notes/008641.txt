HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 year-old
diabetic male with known coronary artery disease transferred
in from ______ ______ presenting with flash pulmonary edema.
He was in the catheterization laboratory where an intraaortic
balloon pump was placed and he has been pain free since.  He
was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit where he was put on a
heparin nitroglycerin drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension,
glaucoma.  He denies stroke, transient ischemic attacks or
claudication.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He stopped smoking tobacco 35 years ago
according to him.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Significant for an augmented diastolic
pressure of 120 to 130 with the pump and pressors set on
admission.  There was no JVD.  There were no bruits.  His
abdomen was soft and obese.  He was regular rate and rhythm.
His catheterization found an EF of 55% with occlusion of the
left internal mammary coronary artery 40%, left anterior
descending coronary artery of 70%, left circumflex of 100%,
right coronary artery 100%.  He was in cardiogenic shock on
admission.

He was taken to the Operating Room on [**2180-2-9**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**].
Please see the operative note for full details of that.
Postoperatively, he was transferred back to the Intensive
Care Unit on pressor support and had a continued and the
intraaortic balloon pump was discontinued.  Physical
examination in the Intensive Care Unit was significant for 1
to 2+ edema bilaterally.  On [**2-11**] we were called.  It was
noted that the patient had a drop in blood pressure and
diaphoresis and the patient showed signs of hemodynamic
compromise on [**2-11**].  This is after the surgery on [**2-8**].  The
patient was in the Intensive Care Unit at this time.  The
patient was taken into the catheterization laboratory where
it was discovered that his grafts had all fallen and went
down.  Basically the LMCA was 40% occluded, the left anterior
descending coronary artery stent.  He continued to have
worsening inferolateral ST depressions.  The patient was
taken back to the Operating Room on [**2180-2-11**] for clotted vein
graft.  He had a thrombectomy of such with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 28037**].  He was transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit.

Hematology/Oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] for evaluation of a
possible hypercoagulable state, which upon further workup
could not be evaluated, because he was on Coumadin and
heparin.  However, tests sent off preliminary came back
negative for protein, CS, lupus, anticoagulant.  The patient
continued in the Intensive Care Unit where he was extubated,
weaned off pressors and was eventually transferred out to the
floor on [**2180-2-16**].  The patient on arrival to the floor still
had chest tubes in place.  Hematology/Oncology continued to
follow along and advised us that the patient was not in a
hypercoagulable state and tests came back negative.  They
will follow on an outpatient basis with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
patient was manifesting odd behavior per his primary
cardiologist and a neurology evaluation was conducted during
the first week of [**Month (only) 956**] as well as a head CT.  The CT of
the head was negative for any signs of stroke or mass effect
and neurology concurred with this and stated that his
personality changes are most likely due to being sent on
bypass twice as well as having a code when his grafts went
down on the 25th.

On the floor the patient had some blood sugar management
issues for which [**Last Name (un) **] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and his sliding scale
was adjusted appropriately and the scale is the one he will
be sent to rehab on.  The patient was noted to have an
edematous leg and his leg harvest site was oozing as well as
slight erythema with no discharge consistent with any type of
cellulitis of his sternal wound and he was started
prophylactically on Levaquin on [**2180-2-23**].  The patient is
tentatively being discharged on [**2180-2-25**] in no acute
distress.  His physical examination revealed some mild
erythema, noninfected, noncellulitic of his sternum and his
leg wound has some discharge of clear fluid from his
edematous leg noninfected looking.  He has no JVD or signs of
hemodynamic instability.

DISPOSITION:  Rehabilitation.

Addendum to follow with final discharge medications and
physical examination prior to discharge.
