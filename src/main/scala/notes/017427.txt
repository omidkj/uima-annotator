History of Present Illness:
60 yo woman with DM, HTN, HLD who was transferred to CT surgery
from OSH due to loculated pleural effusion.  She says that she
had a few weeks of fatigue/malaise, and then hit her right
ribcage on a towel rack, presenting with pleuritic chest wall
pain to OSH on [**2143-5-28**] - she had a normal CXR and was sent home
with analgesia.  On [**5-31**] she re-presented to [**Hospital1 1562**] with
severe dyspnea and again chest pain.  Per report, she
decompensated over 24 hours and was intubated for respiratory
distress.  CXR showed a loculated effusion, CT showed no PE and
a small pleural effusion.  She was noted to be febrile and was
started empirically on Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. On [**6-2**] she
underwent brochoscopy and thoracentesis.  Bronch revealed
extrinsic compression of the R bronchus intermedius without
invasion of the bronchus or trachea.  Thoracentesis had a few
PMNs, no organisms and was negative for AFB.  At this point she
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible VATS given concern for
empyema.

Imaging at [**Hospital1 18**] revealed a loculated R sided pleural effusion,
concerning for infection versus malignancy, a collapsed RML and
RLL.  Pt. underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2143-6-5**], which revealed
grossly purulent secretions in RLL, no malignant appearing
lesions.  A chest tube was inserted with production of 300 cc
straw colored fluid, no blood.

CT chest [**6-4**]:IMPRESSION: 1. Loculated right pleural effusion,
with new anterior and worsening interfissural component, and
adjacent atelectasis of the right lower lobe and right middle
lobe. 2. Extrinsic compression to the bronchus intermedius from
loculated effusion. 3. New small left pleural effusion, with
adjacent atelectasis at the left lung base; however cannot
exclude superinfection/pneumonia. 4. 4-mm ground glass nodule in
the right upper lobe, attention on next followup, likley
infectious with interval decrease in size. 5. Chest tube in
place extending into the major component of the pleural effusion
along the chest wall and the tip at the right lung apex;
however, not draining the loculated effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 85681**] is a 60 year-old lady who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
loculated right-sided pleural effusion that was most likely
secondary to infection.

1) Infectious loculated effusion.
The etiology of the patients loculated effusion was initially
unclear - a diagnosis of infectious versus malignant effusion
could not be made. The differential diagnosis initially also
included rheumatologic causes, pancreatitis or PE. The patient
was initiated on broad antibiotic therapy, vancomycin,
metronidazol and levofloxacin. The patient received a
bronchoscopy on [**2143-6-5**], which revealed grossly purulent
secretions in the right lower lobe and no malignant appearing
lesions.  A chest tube was inserted with production of 300 cc
straw colored fluid and no blood.   The effusion was exudative
by LDH and Albumin criteria.  On [**6-6**] tPa was administered to her
chest tubes and she was diuresed with good urine output and
chest tube drainage.  By [**6-7**], her respiratory status had
improved such that she was successfully extubated. Cytology from
her bronchoscopy at this time was negative for malignant cells.
The cells were predominantly neutrophils and lymphocytes with
few mesothelial cells and histiocytes.  The etiology of her
effusion was infectious, likely Group B streptococcus, which
often goes to the pleura, although all cultures were no growth
throughout her MICU stay.  The patient remained on triple
antibiotic therapy (Day 4 of 14 at time of transfer) and
Vancomycin troughs were measured and dosing was adjusted as
required.
She was transferred to Medicine on Vanc/Levo/Flagyl - she was
able to be weaned onto room air and was breathing comfortably.
She was transitioned to PO Moxifloxacin (goal = total of 14 days
of antibiotics).  Per CT surgery recs, her chest tube was d/c'd
when it stopped draining; repeat cheat CT showed smaller but
persisting loculated effusion which could be followed up on as
an outpatient (may require Pleur-x or pigtail catheter in the
future).
By the end of her stay, she was able to ambulate around the
floor on room air without desatting; she was sent home with
close PC follow-up and Thoracic Surgery clinic follow-up.
.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure.
The patient's respiratory failure was presumed hypoxic.  The
hypoxmemia was likely secondary to a combination of right middle
and lower lobe collapse with a componenet of volume overload. As
the patient was at high risk for CAD and had a significant
systolic ejection murmur on physical exam and echo was performed
on [**6-6**] to assess for heart failure.  The echo showed mild
diastolic failure with preservation of systolic function (EF>
75%).  Diuresis of the patient improved respiratory function
such that she was successfully intubated on [**6-7**].  Diuresis
continued post transfusion with a goal of net negative 1 liter
per day as patient continued to be volume overloaded.
.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure:
The patient was continued on her home medication, Carvedilol.
She received an echo on [**6-6**] to assess possible heart failure as
a contributor of the patient's respiratory failure in the
setting of a significant risk factors systolic ejecti
