insufficiency, and HTN, who presented to the ED with Na of 113.
She was in her usual state of health until last week, when she

procedure well. Upon arriving home, she attempted to eat, and
became immediatedly nauseated. For the next six day, the patient

Pertinent Results:

Micro on admission:
U/A: 100 Protein, 1000 glucose, Trace blood

Discharge labs:
Sodium on discharge: 127
Urine lytes: [**2105-7-26**]  Na-23, URINE Osmolal-304
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is prolonged. ST-T wave
changes which are most
consistent with underlying left ventricular hypertrophy,
although ischemia
or myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. Compared to the
previous tracing
the Q-T interval is longer.

Rate	PR	QRS	QT/QTc	P	QRS	T
61	164	96	490/491	-9	25	161
Imaging:

CXR ([**7-26**]): In comparison with study of [**7-23**], there is further
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural
effusions and increasing
pulmonary venous pressure. Findings are consistent with the
clinical
impression of overhydration.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year-old woman with h/o CHF, chronic renal insufficiency,
DM2, who presents with hyponatremia.

# Hyponatremia: The patient was admitted to the ICU. She with
hyponatremia with a nadir of 113 meq in the setting of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and an increase in her lasix dose.
Nephrology was consulted and she was started on hypertonic
saline, a high protein diet to increase osmoles, and a 1.2L
fluid restriction, with improvement in her serum sodium.
Hypertonic saline was stopped on [**2105-7-24**].  Her hyponatremia was
thought to be a combination of a tea and toast diet, with
decreased solute intake; fluid loses from vomiting and diarrhea;
and increased lasix dosing. Her sodium climbed to 123 and she
was transferred to the general medicine floors where she
continued a fluid restriction and a high protein diet. On [**7-25**],
she was given 20 cc/hr of hypertonic saline for 10 hr. Her
sodium corrected to 127 on discharge. She will have renal
followup.
.
# Hypertension: The patient has a history of HTN, for which she
takes Metoprolol, Enalapril, and Furosemide at home. Her BP
remained elevated as high as SBP~200. She was started on her
home dose of Enalapril and Metoprolol and her blood pressures
continued to be high. On discharge, she was given no further BP
medications and will have followup with renal and her PCP for BP
management.
.
#UTI: The patient presented with UTI on [**7-16**] and was prescribed
3 days of Cipro. She presented once again with UTI symptoms on
[**7-22**] and was put on a 7 day course of Cipro 500, however, it was
stopped on [**7-25**] because it has been linked to hyponatremia. On
discharge, she had no symptoms of dysuria.
.
# DM2: The patient was switched from Januvia to a humalog
insulin sliding scale. Her glucoses were high ranging from
~170-220. On discharge, she was switched back to her Januvia.

#ANEMIA: The patient's crit was 27.6 on admission [**7-22**] and
dropped as low as 22.5 [**7-24**] but has generally stayed in the mid
to high 20s. She has had chronic low crits for the past year
likely due to low EPO levels as a result of her CKD. Her latest
iron studies showed normal iron and transferrin levels and an
elevated ferritin.
.
#DIASTOLIC HF: EF 50-55% in 9/[**2103**]. No active symptoms.
