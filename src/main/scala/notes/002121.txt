Colonscopy-cecal lipoma and friable mucosa at the sigmoid
flexure which was biopsied

CT abdomen-1. Wall thickening and stranding of the pericolonic
fat around the splenic flexure. Distribution is consistent with
ischemic colitis. However, other forms of colitis including
infectious or inflammatory colitis cannot be excluded based on
CT scan.
2. Probable tiny left adrenal adenoma.
3. Enlarge left paraaortic lymph nodes measuring up to 11 mm.
They are increased when compared to [**2160**]. Clinical correlation
recommended.
4. Severe degenerative changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine
with severe spinal stenosis at multiple levels as described
above. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
GI bleed-In the MICU the pt had a transfusion of total 6 units
of FFP, Hct dropped to 27.5 subsequently increased to 33.5. INR
was lowered to 1.8. Stable hemodynamics. EGD on [**2164-1-11**] showed
mild gastritis and duodenitis. Colonscopy on [**1-13**] tiny polyps
in the distal rectum, lipoma in the cecum, nodular infiltrate
with purplish, edematous, and friable mucosa in the left colon
near the splenic flexure from 55 to 45 cm. Erythematous and
congested mucosa with patchy ulcerations from 45 to 25 cm.
Biopsy was taken. Pt was transfered to the floor for further
management.
In the setting of supratherapeutic INR: Unclear source.
Colonoscopy showed friable mucosa in splenic flexure with
stranding on CT. Due to history of hypotensive episode and
distribution is vascular watershed area this was thought to be
due to ischemic colitis. Contributing factor was INR 7.0. Hct
has been remained stable for 72h but was transfused 1 U PRBC's
due to feeilng of weakness on [**2164-1-16**] with apropriate rise in
Hct. Biopsies from colonoscopy will need to be followed up and
relayed to the the patient likely via her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

.
# Elevated INR: Has been on couamdin for DVT and plavix for CVA.
No DVT in RLE on doppler but was a suboptimal study. Since
ischemic bowel was not thought to be due to embolic source but
pt had hx of TIA and DVT with PE heparin was starting with goal
PTT of 50-70 until coumadin was titrated to INR 2.0-2.2 with
plan for undershoot since history of GIB. After approval from GI
plavix was also restarted.
.

# Tachycardia: Intially thought to be due to GI bleed although
has been chronic. CTA in past have been negative showing no PRE
as cause. She had one episone of an asymptomatic 10 beat run of
NSVT on [**2164-1-16**]. She remained hypertensive and was started on
low dose metoprolol at 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. . WBC normal and afebrile today
- unlikely infection.
.
# Diabetes: Long-standing. On NPH and ISS with FS remaining
mostly in the 130-180 range. Continued ISS and [**2-13**] NPH as NPO.
.
# MS: No active disease per patient. Not on steroids or
immunosuppresants.
.
# Seizure history: on tegretol and Levatiracetam. CT head w/o
bleed. EEG was negative for epileptiform activity. She was seen
by neurology who witness arm twitch and felt that it was due to
seizure activity. Per neurology she was started on Keppra which
was titrated up to 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] with plan to titrate of the
carbamazepine with 100mg qid for 5 days then 100mg [**Hospital1 **] for 5
days and then discontinue. pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 100771**].

# Recent DVT - Had been on coumadin. No clinical evidence of PE
at present, although she had concerning tachycardia and low
grade fever. RLE u/s was negative but LLE not done due to
patient noncompliance. Coumadin restarted as above with heparin
bridge on day of discharge heparin was at 1900 u/hr with stable
PTT.
