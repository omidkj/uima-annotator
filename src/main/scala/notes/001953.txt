History of Present Illness:
79-year-old woman who is being admitted for abdominal pain and
hypotension. She was noted in the ED to have temperature to 104.
Cultures were taken, pressures dropped to SBP 80s. Femoral line

conservatively with ibuprofen and tylenol prn, with negative
head CT and negative CT c-spine. She was also treated for
urinary tract infection during that admission with a Levaquin. A
foley catheter was left in place due to concern of urinary
retention.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a very pleasant 79 yo woman who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED with initial symptom of abdominal pain, and was
admitted to the ICU with fevers and hypotension without obvious
source. She was called out to the general medicine service on
[**2123-6-27**], and was discharged from the hospital on [**2123-7-1**] in good
condition, ambulatory, with stable vital signs. Her brief
hospital course was notable for:
.
# Fever/Hypotension: At the time of admission septic shock was
the largest concern.  There was no obvious infection despite
broad infectious work-up.  Only clear source of infection was
left hand cellulitis which rapidly improved on Vancomycin. TSH
and cortisol both normal, ruling out endocrine sources of
hypotension.  During admission she did have evidence of melena
with a GI hemorrhage, but had minimal drop in Hct.  She was
treated with Vancomycin for 7-day course for possible hand
cellulitis (Day 1 = [**6-24**]).  Was also treated with Flagyl
empirically for C. Diff.  This was stopped with culture came
back negative. By the time the Pt was called out to the floor
fevers and hypotension resolved and the Pt remained afebrile and
normotensive or hypertensive while on the floor. The Pt
completed a 7 day course of vancomycin for presumed L hand
cellulitis. The exact cause of the patient's fever and
hypotension remains unclear. She has had recent admissions to
outside hospitals for fevers which have reportedly been
unrevealing. This will require further outpatient workup, but at
the time of discharge the Pt did not have active medical issues
to prohibit her discharge.
.
# Melena:  Hematocrit downtrended slowly. Received one unit
PRBCs on [**6-27**]. H.pylori serology negative. GI was consulted and
recommended EGD. EGD was performed on [**2123-6-29**] which demonstrated
gastritis and esophagitis, but no active bleeding. Two biopsies
were obtained. Pt was started on sucralfate 1 mg QID and given
prescription to continue this as outpatient. Pt's dose of
pantoprozole was increased from 40 mg qD to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Diet
recommendations were made including avoiding caffeine, onions,
alcohol, chocolate, and peppermint. Pt's aspirin 81 mg daily was
stopped. Pt did not have any further episodes of melena or Hct
drop while in the hospital.
.
# Vasculitis.  Initially started on IV steroids given concern
for possible adrenal insufficiency as source of hypotension.
Cortisol was normal.  She was then rapidly tapered to on day to
Prednisone 5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Home prednisone dosing was confirmed and
she was transitioned to 5 mg prednisone daily. At the time of
discharge she was maintained on her admission dose of 2.5 mg qD
and 5 mg qHS.
.
# Hypoxic episodes: Patient intermittently with oxygen
saturation below 90%.  This was in the setting of Ativan and
associated somnolence.  Also appeared to have a positional, OSA
component. At the time of discharge the Pt had been maintaining
O2 sats over 90% on RA for over 24 hours.  Should have
outpatient sleep evaluation.
.
# Dementia: Patient was continued on Namenda.
.
# GERD: Patient was continued on Protonix.  This was increased
to [**Hospital1 **] once she developed guaiac positive stools.
.
# Neck pain: Contined on lidocaine patch.
.
# Depression: Continued on Citalopram.
.
# Hypertension: Pt was noted to be hypertensive to 180s systolic
on the day prior to discharge. Her Metoprolol dose was increased
on the day of discharge from 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
Optimization of her outpatient medication should be done as an
outpatient, including addition of a thiazide diuretic and/or ACE
inhibitor.
.
# Left hand swelling: Pt had left hand swelling and was treated
with a 7 day course of Vancomycin for cellulitis. After the
treatment, on two different days the Pt experienced left hand
swelling, without pain, erythema, warmth vascular compromise, or
limitation in range of motion, which resolved spontaneously. The
etiology of this swelling is unclear. The Pt had negative
ultrasound studies of the upper
