Findings
Multiplanar reconstructions were generated and confirmed on an
independent workstation.
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity
(<0.2m/s) No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. No
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the RA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Moderate-severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate-severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Severe AS (area
0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) AR. Eccentric AR jet directed toward the
anterior mitral leaflet.
MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
(1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion
circumferential.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I
certify I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The
patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.
No TEE related complications. Results were personally reviewed
with the MD caring for the patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s).
There is mild-mod symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Estimated
LVEF-30-35%. There is severe global hypokinesis, most notable in
the mid-inferoseptal segment.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic arch,
and descending thoracic aorta.

There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric and directed
toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a moderate sized circumferential pericardial effusion
(1.5-2cm).
Post-Bypass:
The patient is A-V Paced and on a norepinephrine infusion s/p
CABG/AVR.
