Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Malaise, weakness, bilateral arm pain and nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is an [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of CAD
s/p CABG, ischemic and valvular cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%),
severe aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2), recent admission for chest
pain s/p cath which showed 3 vessel native coronary artery
disease, patent SVG-OM, SVG-RCA, LIMA-LAD, severe aortic
stenosis, and severely elevated LV diastolic and systolic
pressures. Her EKG at the time showed small ST elevations in V1
and aVR, CE were negative. She returned to the hospital
complaining malaise and weakness, bilateral arm pain and nausea.
The patient developed chest pain again while in the ED, her EKG
showed concerning ST depression in the inferior lateral leads.
The cardiology fellow was called and she was started on heparin
drip with bolus and given a dose of morphine, now chest pain
free. Her troponins were negative. She was given a dose of
potassium for hypokalemia. She was admitted for further
management of Afib with RVR and hypotension.

Imaging:
- Portable TTE (Complete) ([**2131-4-2**] at 3:45:43 PM)
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with global hypokinesis and regioanl
akinesis of the distal LV/apex and lateral walls. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2131-3-8**], the LVEF and RVEF hasve
decreased. If indicated, a dobutamine echo may better assess
true critical AS from a low-output state.
.
- Portable TEE (Complete) ([**2131-4-5**] at 10:30:00 AM)
IMPRESSION: Significant calcific aortic stenosis. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Complex
aortic atheroma. Depressed [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular function.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) ([**2131-4-11**] at 11:43:26 AM)
RESULT: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2131-4-2**], velocities across the aortic valve have decreased. LV
function is substantially better - ejection fraction appears
normal on the current study. Therefore, the degree of reduction
of aortic stenosis is probably greater than that suggested by
reduced velocities. The degree of mitral regurgitation has also
decreased and is now mild to moderate. Mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation is now seen.
.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**2131-3-9**])
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-OM, SVG-RCA, LIMA-LAD. 3. Severe aortic stenosis.
4. Severely elevated left ventricular diastolic and systolic
pressures.
.
ECG ([**2131-4-1**]  12:21:12 PM)
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with ST-T wave abnormalities. Intra-ventricular
conduction delay with left axis deviation is probably left
anterior fascicular block and additional intraventricular
conduction delay/possible right ventricular conduction delay.
Cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of [**2131-3-9**] there may be no
significant change but unstable baseline on previous tracing
makes comparison difficult.
.
ECG ([**2131-4-10**]  9:08:54 AM)
Sinus bradycardia. Left axis deviation. Non-specific
intraventricular
conduction delay. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2131-4-3**]
the rate is slower and sinus rhythm is now clearly present.
