Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 70 yo f w/ h/o ESLD and grade I varices who p/w
weakness, LE edema, and anemia.
.
1) anemia- felt likely [**1-16**] slow GIB given guiac + stool. Egd
showed gastritis and grade I varices, and GI consult felt this
was the explanation for the patient's hct drop.  H. pylori
negative. The patient was transfused 2U PRBC, and her hct
remained stable throughout her hospital course. She should have
a f/u EGD which is already scheduled with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 572**] in [**Month (only) **].
She was also started on iron supplementation and [**Hospital1 **] protonix.
.
2) thrombocytopenia- likely [**1-16**] liver dz +/- splenomegaly.
Seemed unlikely to be related to med effect and there was no
evidence of ongoing infection. Also could be related to acute
etoh effect (particularly given elevated AST).  Very low
suspicion for diffuse marrow process or malignancy.  Platelets
remained stable and were actually trending up during this
hospital course.
.
3) ischemia - mild troponin and ecg changes c/w low grade
ischemia. No evidence of ACS.  Ecg changes resolved w/ support
of her hct.
.
4) copd- no pfts on record but exam on HD3 and 4 c/w flair and
patient has significant smoking history. started on nebs and
completed a 5d course of steroids. On transfer to the floor, the
patient had clear lungs and did not require O2, nebs or endorse
SOB. Discharged patient on combivent inhaler.
.
5) esld- initially held lasix/aldactone while in house and this
was then resumed. She was also given lactulose for hepatic
encephalopathy which was d/c'd when her mental status cleared.
She was started back on lasix/aldactone at home dose on [**8-27**] but
became hypernatremic so subsequently held again. We restarted
these medications on discharge and patient should have her
electrolytes rechecked within the next week at rehab. She was
also started on thiamine and folate.
.
6) encephalopathy- likely [**1-16**] esld and etoh w/d.  Head ct
performed given that pt had recent fall and it was negative for
ICH. She was treated w/ 3d iv thiamine for possible Wernicke's.
Mental status changes resolved w/ aggressive lactulose and
clearing of benzodiazepenes. We stopped lactulose when patient's
mental status cleared and her NH4 was normal. On discharge, she
was at her mental status baseline.
.
7) etoh w/d with DTs- req'd extremely large doses of ativan
(chosen over valium due to impaired liver fxn), on HD 2 the
patient req'd 60 mg ativan througout the day.  Titrated off over
the subsequent 6 days.  On transfer to floor on [**8-31**], patient
has not req'd any ativan and was in the clear in terms of ETOH
withdrawl. Patient is to be discharged to [**Hospital **] rehab center. We
had a family meeting and discussed all the issues and patient
wants treatment for alcoholism and will be discharged to
[**Hospital 27596**] Rehab.
.
8) ppx- maintained on pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia
initially, then sub q heparin. ppi [**Hospital1 **]
