Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
S/p fall, Right subdural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2170-7-7**] Right craniotomy for subdural evacuation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 85 year old female on Aspirin/Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation who is status post presumed mechanical fall on
[**2170-7-6**]. She attempted to stand from a seated position and fell
onto her right side. She presents from [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital where she
had a Head CT that was consistent with subdural hematoma with
midline shift.  The patient was given 1 unit of fresh frozen
plasma and transferred here for further evaluation and
treatment.

While in the ED, the patient became nauseous with increasing
headache and a repeat Head Ct was performed.  The patient was
given an additional unit of FFP/profiline 9, and vitamin K.  The
patient was loaded with Dilantin.  The patient's son was present
and stated that his mother refused to go to the hospital
yesterday, but this morning she was lethargic and confused so he
brought her to [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital.  He also stated the she was a Full
Code.  The patient proceeded to become lethargic and stopped
following commands while in the Emergency Department.

Head CT [**2170-7-7**]
FINDINGS:  Again visualized is a hyperdensity along the inner
table of the
skull on the right ranging from anterior to the right frontal
lobe to the
right parietal lobe, consistent with an acute subdural hematoma.
 This
hemorrhage measures 14 mm in maximal dimension from the inner
table of the
skull and demonstrates mass effect on adjacent sulci and the
right frontal and parietal lobe with stable leftward shift of
normally midline structures by 8 mm.  No new foci of hemorrhage
are identified.  A hypodensity region is again noted in the
right frontal lobe, and may represent an infarction of
indeterminate age.  Confluence of periventricular white matter
hypodensities.  Bilateral basal ganglia calcifications are again
identified.  No acute fractures are noted.  There is mild
sphenoidal mucosal thickening as well as mild opacification of
the right maxillary air cells.  Otherwise, the remainder of the
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Stable appearance of acute right subdural hematoma, ranging
from anterior to the right frontal lobe to posterior to the
right occipital lobe measuring approximately 14 mm in maximal
dimension from the inner table of the skull.  There is continued
stable leftward shift of normally midline structures by 8 mm.
New foci of hemorrhage is identified.  Continued followup is
recommended.

2.  Hypodense region in the right frontal lobe is again noted
and may
represent an infarction of indeterminate age, versus a
confluence of
periventricular white matter hypodensity.


Chest Xray [**2170-7-7**]
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
 There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of
the left posterior
costophrenic sulcus may represent a tiny pleural effusion or
scarring.
Prominent diffuse interstitial markings suggest underlying
chronic lung
disease.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal silhouette
and hilar
contours are within normal limits.  Degenerative changes seen in
the shoulders bilaterally.  No displaced rib fracture is
identified. A wedge compression deformity in the lower
thoracic/upper lumbar spine is of unknown chronicity. Aortic
calcifications are better seen on the prior study.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intrathoracic process.
2. Wedge compression deformity in the lower thoracic/upper
lumbar spine of
unknown chronicity. Correlate with exam.

Head CT [**2170-7-7**]
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right craniectomy with
interval
evacuation of the right subdural hemorrhage.  The subdural
cavity has been
replaced by air.  There is persistent 8 mm leftward shift of
normally midline structures. A small left parafalcine hemorrhage
layering along the left tentorium is more apparent than prior
studies. No new intraparenchymal hemorrhage is identified.
Hypodensity in the right frontal lobe is unchanged and may
represent an infarction of indeterminate age versus confluence
of periventricular white matter hypodensity.  Mild mucosal
thickening is seen in the right sphenoid sinus. The mastoid air
cells and middle ear cavities are clear.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Post-surgical changes after right craniectomy with stable 8
mm leftward
shift of normally midline structures.
2.  Small left parafalcine subdural hemorrhage.

Pelvis Xray [**2170-7-8**]
FINDINGS:  There are no old films available for comparison.
This is a single AP view of the pelvis.  There is diffuse
osteopenia, which somewhat limits evaluation.  There is an old
healed left hip fracture with an intramedullary rod and screw
with associated deformity of the left femoral head and new bone
formation extending into the soft tissues.  No new fracture is
identified, but osteopenia limits this assessment.

CT head [**2170-7-12**]
There is reaccumulation of fresh subdural hematoma along the
right
convexity.
New right parietal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage surrounded
by edema

[**7-15**]: CXR: FINDINGS:  Tip of the nasogastric tube is in the
mid-to-lower stomach with the side hole just distal to the
esophagogastric junction.  Little change in the heart and lungs
when compared to the study of this date.

[**2170-7-18**]: Video Swallow evaluation:
TECHNIQUE:  Oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was
performed in
conjunction with the speech and swallow division.  Multiple
consistencies of barium were administered.

FINDINGS:  Barium passes freely through the oropharynx and
esophagus without evidence of obstruction.  There was, however,
deep penetration and aspiration with nectar and honey-thick
barium.  There was residual barium with all thicknesses, most
pronounced with pudding thickness barium.

IMPRESSION:  Penetration and aspiration with nectar and
honey-thick bariu
