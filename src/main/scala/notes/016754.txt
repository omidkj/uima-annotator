CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Aorto [**Hospital1 **]-iliac occlusive disease and right
iliac artery aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74 year old
nondiabetic white male with coronary artery disease,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who was transferred from
[**Hospital6 204**] in [**2196-7-9**], to [**Hospital1 346**], with an acute myocardial infarction
and complete heart block which required the placement of
temporary pacing wires.  During cardiac catheterization at
[**Hospital1 69**], the patient was found
to have a right iliac artery aneurysm and was stented prior
to cardiac catheterization.  The patient subsequently
underwent a coronary artery bypass graft times two on
[**2196-7-27**].  Postoperatively, he had an isolated episode of AV
dissociation and was evaluated by the electrophysiology
service.  Study revealed inducible ventricular tachycardia
and the patient underwent an internal cardiac defibrillator
and pacemaker placement on [**2196-7-28**].

Following recovery from his coronary artery bypass graft, the
patient is admitted for elective repair of his 3.0 centimeter
right common iliac artery aneurysm as well as an aorto
bifemoral bypass graft for bilateral claudication.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction [**2187**],
myocardial infarction [**7-10**]; coronary artery bypass graft
times two [**7-10**], at [**Hospital1 69**].
2.  Complete heart block, permanent pacemaker placement
[**2196-7-28**].
3.  Inducible ventricular tachycardia; internal cardiac
defibrillator placement, [**2196-7-28**].
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.
6.  Chronic low back pain.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery bypass graft times two on [**2196-7-25**], by

1.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Enalapril 5 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Aspirin one p.o. once daily.
8.  Multivitamin one p.o. once daily.
9.  Doxepin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed pulse 59, blood
pressure left arm 187/80, height five feet seven inches,
weight 160 pounds.  In general, the patient is alert,
cooperative white male in no acute distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Sclera anicteric.  Neck
reveals no lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Carotids
palpable.  No bruits.  Chest - The heart is regular rate and
rhythm without murmur.  The lungs are clear bilaterally.  The
abdomen is soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal
examination was deferred.  Extremities no edema.  Palpable
femoral pulses bilaterally, left stronger than right.
Dorsalis pedis pulses palpable bilaterally.  Neurological
examination is nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, [**2197-4-19**], white blood cell
count 7.7, hemoglobin 15.0, hematocrit 43.8, platelet count
179,000.  Prothrombin time 11.9, partial thromboplastin time
24.8, INR 0.9.  Sodium 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 97, CO2
30, blood urea nitrogen 33, creatinine 1.3, glucose 85.

Chest x-ray showed no acute pulmonary disease.
Electrocardiogram showed a regular AV sequential pacing.
Pacemaker rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2197-4-26**], following an aorto bifemoral bypass graft and right
iliac artery aneurysm repair.  The surgery was complicated by
considerable intraoperative bleeding with an estimated blood
loss of five liters.  The patient was resuscitated with
packed red blood cells, platelets, cryoprecipitate, and
crystalloid for a total of approximately 20 liters.
Postoperatively, the patient's feet were equally warm and he
had palpable posterior tibialis pulses.  The patient was
started on perioperative Kefzol.  The electrophysiology
service disabled his ICD which had been set for a heart rate
of 60.  At the end of surgery, they reprogrammed his ICD for
pacing at 70 instead of 60.

The patient remained intubated and sedated on Propofol
because of respiratory compromise from massive fluid
resuscitation.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural
effusions and moderate congestive heart failure immediately
postoperatively.

The patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit where aggressive pulmonary toilet was maintained and
aggressive diuresis with intravenous Lasix was continued.
Diamox was added on postoperative day number six for 48 hours
and then both Diamox and Lasix were stopped.  The patient
continued to diurese on his own.  The patient was extubated
on [**2197-5-3**].  While the patient was intubated, he also had a
nasogastric tube in place.  TPN had been started on [**2197-5-3**].
However, on the day following extubation, the patient had
some bowel sounds and so sips of clear liquid were started.
The following day the patient's diet was advanced and the day
after that the patient was able to tolerate a regular diet.
His TPN was then stopped.

Postoperatively, the patient had several fever spikes.
Sputum cultures, grain stain showed gram negative rods.  The
patient was started on a ten day course of Levofloxacin and
Vancomycin.  Cultures finally grew E. coli.  There were no
gram positive cocci.  Vancomycin was stopped.  The patient
will be discharged home to complete a ten day course of
Levofloxacin.

Physical therapy evaluated the patient for full weight
bearing ambulation.  Home physical therapy evaluation was
recommended by the VNA.

At the time of discharge, the patient's abdominal and groin
incisions were clean, dry and intact.  His abdominal staples
were removed and the incision was Steri-stripped at the time
of discharge.  His groin staples will remain for two more
weeks.  His feet were equally warm with palpable posterior
tibialis pulses.

The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the office on
Thursday, [**2197-5-11**].  He will follow-up with his cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12167**], within two weeks of discharge because of change
in his blood pressure medications during hospitalization.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily for six more days.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Atorvastatin 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Darvocet N-100 one tablet p.o. q6hours p.r.n. pain.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.  Discharge home with
VNA services.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aorto [**Hospital1 **]-iliac disease and right iliac artery aneurysm.
2.  Aorto bifemoral bypass graft and right iliac artery
aneurysm repair on [**2197-4-26**].

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Significant intraoperative bleeding.
2.  Respiratory compromise secondary to fluid resuscitation
resulting in prolonged intubation.
3.  E. coli pneumonia.
4.  Lack of nutrition secondary to intubation; TPN started.
5.  Coronary artery disease.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
