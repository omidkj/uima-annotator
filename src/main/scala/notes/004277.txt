History of Present Illness:
-- per admitting [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] resident --
Ms. [**Known lastname 10336**] is a 46 year old lady with a history malignant thymoma
(full onc history below) who presents here due to dyspnea and
cough, which has been progressive over many months.  Patient
states that her breathing is getting worse, and that her oxygen
requirement at home has increased from 2.5lpm to 3lpm.  She has
also had a worsening cough productive of thick, yellow sputum.
Patient denies fevers, chest pain, headache, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or BRBPR.  She does report darker
colored urine of late and a 30 lb. weight loss ove the past 2
years.
.
One day prior to admission patient  called into the Pulmonary
clinic to report worsening eye and leg edema and was instructed
to taper her prednisone over 2 weeks.  She says she now comes to
the ED to seek help with shortness of breath, as well as to
receive further treatment for her cancer.
.
In the ED, Initial VS: 97.5 110 112/72 RR 19, SP02 97% @ 3-4LNC.
 Patient received Levofloxacin 750mg/Vanc 1gram for questionable
pneumonia due to worsening LUL CXR findings.  She also received
20mEq of Potsasium and was continued on oxygen. An 18 gauge IV
was placed.  VS prior to transfer: 99 126/80 24 98 % 4.5L NC
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient's vitals were R: 99.8, HR: 105,
BP: 119/84, SP02: 97%.  Patient complains of shortness of breath
but denies any pain.

CXR [**2122-2-13**]
Stable opacification of the left lower and mid lung, attributed
to the
patient's known pleural metastatic disease. Interval patchy
opacities noted at the left lung apex could represent pneumonia
versus progression of metastatic disease. Correlation with
clinical history and possible CT of the chest may be helpful in
further evaluation.
.
RUQ U/S:
1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
2. Mildly increased echogenicity of the liver is a nonspecific
finding. This is most likely due to fatty infiltration, although
more advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot
be excluded.
3. New ascites.
.
CT chest/abd/pel [**2-15**]:
1. Multiple lobulated pleural-based masses on the left, which
are unchanged
in size and appearance compared to the prior study.

2. Consolidation and bronchiectasis in the left upper lobe in
addition to
diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, ground-glass opacities, and more
focal nodules within the right lung, all of which are highly
concerning for an infectious process. However, malignancy cannot
entirely be excluded and clinical correlation is recommended, as
well as follow-up imaging surveillance. The appearance includes
a new right basilar consolidation with bronchiectasis, and
apparently superimposed on nearly confluent pleural masses in
the left hemithorax are patchy consolidations, most confluent at
the left apex, with bronchiectasis, probably due to infection,
or potentially radiation if such therapy has been recently
performed.
.
3. No focal liver lesions or intrahepatic biliary dilatation to
explain the patient's LFT abnormalities.
.
3. Marked intra-abdominal ascites.
.
4. Stable-appearing deep pleural metastases noted extending into
the deep
pleural surfaces on the left.
.
TTE [**2-17**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3)
