HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 53 year old
male being transferred from the Intensive Care Unit after
admission there for nonconvulsive status epilepticus.  The
patient is a 53 year old male with a history of seizure
disorder since the age of 10 including seven to eight life
time generalized tonoclonic seizures, who has not had a
seizure in four to five years, end stage renal disease, and
hepatitis C positivity, who presented with behavioral changes
including confusion, depressed mental status and abnormal
grimacing and squeezing of his eyes on Sunday, [**2132-9-22**].
Initially, he was felt to be uremic and during preparation
for dialysis, he received 1 mg Ativan.  His behavioral
changes improved after the Ativan and the patient started to
climb out of bed.  Diagnosis of nonconvulsive status
epilepticus was entertained at that time and confirmed by
electroencephalogram.  His Dilantin was noted to be
subtherapeutic on admission and the patient endorses
decreased outpatient compliance with this medication.  The
patient's renal failure and hepatitis C were not felt to be
contributing to his problems and their outpatient treatment
was continued in the Intensive Care Unit.  The patient has
received Ativan and Dilantin while in the Intensive Care Unit
and his behavioral changes have improved.  He was
transferred to the Neurology service on [**2132-9-23**], for further
evaluation.
