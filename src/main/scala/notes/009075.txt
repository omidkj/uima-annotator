TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 55
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-9-30**],
the regional wall motion abnormality was present previously
although not reported. There is no aortic regurgitation detected
in either study.
.
CTA CHEST
1. Multifocal pneumonia with associated reactive lymph nodes.
2. No pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions; cannot exclude infected pleural
effusions as there is enhancement of the adjacent pleural
surfaces.
4. Degenerative change of thoracic spine and DISH.
5. Calcification in gallbladder, which may be within the wall,
should be further evaluated by non- urgent ultrasound.

Brief Hospital Course:
63M with CAD s/o CABG with recent stent in LCx [**9-22**] who
presents with shortness of breath and flash pulmonary edema in
setting of diastolic heart failure.
.
Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Pulmonary
Patient presented without fever or leukocytosis.  CTA was
negative for PE, however it was positive for multifocal
pneumonia and bilateral pleural effusions.  He was started on
levofloxacin for presumed community acquired pneumonia.  He
twice experienced acute SOB associated with severe HTN (SBP
200s) and was found to have flash pulmonary edema in the setting
of diastolic heart dysfunction.  His overlying pneumonia was
thought to contribute to this decompensation as well.  He was
transferred to the MICU for management.  He underwent diuresis
and his BP was controlled.  His pulmonary status responded well
to these interventions and he was transferred to the cardiology
service.  Repeat chest imaging showed a stable right middle lobe
nodule opacification.  Infectious disease and pulmonary were
consulted to comment on CT chest findings in the setting of
atypical presentation of infection (no leukocytosis, fever,
productive cough).  ID recommended a battery of infectious
disease studies including fungal and atypical infectious causes
of pneumonia as well as immunodeficiency workup (HIV testing).
A PPD was placed on [**2115-10-22**] on the right forearm.  Pulmonary
considered the lesion to be a polymicrobial abscess and
recommended a prolonged course of PO antibiotics with repeat
imaging w/ CT and outpatient pulmonary follow up.  He was
scheduled for repeat CT scan prior to his pulmonary appointment.
 He was stable on room air for several days prior to discharge,
albiet with a mild cough worse at night.
.
# CAD
Patient with known severe CAD with recent stenting in [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2114**] to LCx and POBA to OM2.  Initial evaluation of cardiac
enzymes was negative, however after the episode of flash
pulmonary edema and HTN his troponins and CK-MB increased.  This
was considered a NSTEMI due to demand ischemia and he was
started on heparin drip in addition to his home medications.
After his enzymes trended down the heparin drip was
discontinued.  He was also started on a nitroglycerin patch to
help alleviate anginal sxs.  Upon discharge he was free of
exertional CP and dyspnea.  He will follow up with his
cardiologist several weeks after discharge.  A repeat stress
test was recommended and ordered to be completed prior to his
next appointment with cardiology.
.
# PUMP: Diastolic CHF / HTN
Patient has known diastolic chronic CHF.  As mentioned, he
likely experienced flash pulmonary edema in setting of
tachycardia, hypertension, pneumonia and mild fluid overload.
His lasix dose was doubled to [**Hospital1 **]; his K and creatinine remained
stable.  Other home medications were continued.
.
# IDDM
Home [**Hospital1 **] NPH was continued, however he experienced a few AM low
AM sugars.  His PM NPH dose was decreased to 39 units with
resolution.  However, given his liberalized diet @ home, he will
continue on his regular 42 units [**Hospital1 **] at home.
.
# Ulcerative Colitis:
Continued 5-ASA.
.
# Depression/Anxiety
Continued Clonazepam and Escitalopram.  Clearly this is an
ongoing issue for him and likely is playing a role in his
ongoing debilitation.  It was recommended that he continue his
weekly group therapy and consult a private therapist if needed.
.
#Disposition
The patient's family was concerned about Mr. [**Known lastname **] returning
home given the disr
