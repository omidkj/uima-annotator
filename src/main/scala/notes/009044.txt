Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Coronary Artery Disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Heart Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
81 yo male with history of HTN, HL, COPD and OSA who recently
had an annual physical and an EKG which was notable for Q waves
and suggestive of an old MI. Recent stress echo showed baseline
anterior hypokinesis which becomes
akinetic at peak stress and extensive ST-T wasve depression,
also notable for possible nontransmural MI and anterior
ischemia. Pt is asymptomatic. Pt presents today for cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate.
.
Cath on [**2-6**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] showed occluded LAD and heavily
calcified coronaries and sequential disease. The operators were
not able to engage a balloon so patient's procedure was ended
and patient was sent to the floor to be evaluated by CT Surgery.
 During the procedure there was concern for a possible small
dissection in the distal right coronary artery that still had
good flow by report.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was comfortable with no pain at
the Cath site, breathing normally and had been made aware of the
need for CABG.
.

CATH [**2159-2-6**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
had mild
disease.  The LAD had a proximal 100% stenosis with collateral
filling
through the RCA.  The LCX had minimal disease.  The RCA had a
99% mid
vessel lesion, and 99% distal lesion at the bifurcation of the
RPL and
RPDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left and right
sided
filling pressures with LVEDP 11mm Hg and RVEDP 8mm Hg.  Cardiac
index
was preserved at 3.16 L/min/m2.  Normal PA pressure with mean PA
18mmHg
and PASP 32 mm Hg.  Normal central arterial pressure at
121/58mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe 2 vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left & right sided filling pressures.
3. Normal cardiac output.

Chest CT [**2159-2-7**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Normal caliber thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic
calcifications as
detailed above.
2. A total of three right apical and middle lobe lung nodules,
ranging up to 8 mm. If prior imaging is available, we are happy
to compare. Otherwise, followup is recommended in three months.
3. Moderate centrilobular emphysema.
4. Asbestos related pleural plaques. No evidence of asbestosis
or
mesothelioma.

Renal US: [**2159-2-7**]
Both kidneys are visualized and normal in size and echogenicity.

The right measures 12.5 cm while the left measures 12.0 cm in
the sagittal
dimension. There is mild fullness in the collecting systems of
the kidneys
bilaterally, more prominent on the left than on the right.
Within the left
kidney at there is a 2.6 x 2.4 x 2.7 cm simple cyst. No
perinephric fluid
collections identified on either side. The bladder is somewhat
distended measuring 10.6 x 11.8 x 11.1 cm but is otherwise
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Mild pelviectasis within the kidneys without
evidence of
caliectasis. Distended bladder.
.
ECHO: [**2159-2-12**]
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 25-30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic root. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Anterior /anteroseptal walls are akinetic and thinned with ?
Aneurysm @the apical portion the anterior wall
Post Bypass
The patient is s/p CABGX2
The patient is on a Norepinephrine drip @ 0.05 mcg/kg/min
The LVEF is 30-35%
There is persistent Akinesis of the Anterior /Anteroseptal wall
with a dyskinetic apex
The Mitral regurgitation is similar to prebypass
All other valves are similar to prebypass on examination

CXR: [**2159-2-14**]: The heart is mildly enlarged. There is continued
central pulmonary vascular congestion, but no overt edema. The
patient has been extubated, and multiple lines, including a
Swan-Ganz catheter, a left thoracostomy tube, mediastinal
drains, and orogastric tube have been removed. There is a new
small right pleural effusion. The lung volumes are low. There is
no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval removal of multiple support lines.
2. New small right pleural effusion.
3. No pneumothorax.

effusion is less prominent. However, this may merely reflect the
upright
position with the fluid gravitating into the lower portions of
the lung.
There is a small effusion on the left.
