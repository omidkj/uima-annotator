[**2164-11-2**] CXR
Decreased left lower lobe atelectasis. Small left pleural
effusion.

[**2164-11-2**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is an apical left
ventricular aneurysm. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
9. There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle
consistent with an
AICD lead.

[**2164-10-25**] XRay finger
There is cortical irregularity of the 4th and 5th proximal
phalanges which may represent healed fractures. Slight lucency
is seen along the cortical irregularity of the proximal fifth
phalanx which may represent residua of prior injury but an acute
hairline fracture cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation to
the patient's site of pain is recommended. Mineralization is
normal. Surrounding soft tissues are unremarkable.

[**2164-10-19**] EKG
Ventricular paced rhythm. Pacemaker rhythm. No further analysis.
Compared to the previous tracing no significant change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2164-10-19**] for elective
surgical management of his coronary artery and mitral valve
disease. He was take directly to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and a
mitral valve repair with a 28mm annuloplasty band.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. The
electrophysiology service was consulted for assistance with
changes to his pacemaker. Good lead function was noted. Mr.
[**Known lastname 38315**] developed respiratory distress and was reintubated.
Vancomycin and levofloxacin was started for presumed aspiration.
Lasix was given intravenously for pulmonary edema and natrecor
was started. He was transfused for postoperative anemia. He
underwent CVVH to assist with fluid management. On postoperative
day five, he was re-extubated successfully without complication.
The physical therapy service worked with him postoperatively to
improve his strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] complained of
right 5th digit pain and an x-ray was obtained. This revealed a
fracture and a splint was applied. His natrecor and milrinone
were slowly weaned. An ace inhibitor was started given his low
ejection fraction. On postoperative day 14, Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
Amiodarone was started for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
Coumadin was resumed. He continued to be gently diuresed towards
his preoperative weight. His creatinine bumped and the renal
service was consulted. A foley was placed and he was transferred
back to the intensive care unit for 1 day. His ace inhibitor was
stopped as well as lasix. Acute renal failure was suspected in
the setting of an ace inhibitor, diuretics and dehydration. Over
the next few days, his creatinine stabilized and began to trend
back towards normal. His foley was removed and a flomax was
started for some frequency, hesitancy and urgency with good
relief. Mr. [**Known lastname 104792**] coumadin was held as his INR was elevated
to 4.2. Vitamin K was also given as he developed a nose bleed.
The Ear, nose and throat service was consulted who recommended
saline mist nasal sprays twice daily. His epistaxis subsequently
resolved. Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] continued to make steady progress and was
discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative day twenty one.
His INR was 4.0 on discharge and his coumadin remains held. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1270**] will manage his coumadin after discharge from rehab
for a goal INR of 1.8-2.2. His room air saturations were 98% and
his discharge x-ray was only notable for a very small left
pleural effusion. Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1270**] as an outpatient.
