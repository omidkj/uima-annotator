Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31014**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catherization


History of Present Illness:
47 y.o. woman with diastolic CHF (NYHA class III), pulmonary
hypertension, severe mitral regurgitation, likely COPD, obesity,
and anemia who is admitted to the CCU following elective left
and right cardiac catheterization, complicated by difficulty
with passing of right artery catheter and need for intubation in
order to remove it.
.
Her cath was an elective procedure for work up of her
progressive shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion, which
has been worsening over the past 2 months.  She also has some
exertional chest tightness which resolves at rest.  She is now
only able to walk 20-30 feet before becoming dyspenic.  Has also
noted some LE edema and palpitations, though those seem related
to her panic attacks.  As part of her work up, an echo was
performed on [**7-12**] demonstrating EF of 60%, with severe MR
(two different jets); mild to moderate TR, and moderate PR. PA
systolic pressure was 46 mmHg with a blunted and dilated IVC.
CTA which was negative for pulmonary emboli but did demonstrate
some mediastinal and Hilar adenopathy. She has been seen by
pulmonary who was not very impressed by this finding, but an
inflammatory or metastatic process could not be ruled out. She
is currently on inhalers which have not improved her breathing
and she has recently been started on home oxygen 3L.  A stress
test was negative for ischemia. She does report occasional chest
tightness which is associated with shortness of breath and
improves with rest. She does report some rare palpitations that
she has related to panic attacks. She has noted edema for two
weeks, equal bilaterally, up to her knees. She was going to
start Furosemide 20mg daily however this was delayed secondary
to cardiac cath. She has slept on [**2-17**] pillows for her GERD. She
report occasional shortness of breath at night, only for the
last 6 weeks or so, reported more as wheezing, which wakes her
up from sleep and resolves when she changes her position. She
reports daily episodes of dizziness, usually with position
changes, with improves with time. She denies any presyncope or
syncope.
.
She has also been found to have new anemia. Previous HCT of 40
in [**2174-9-15**] now down to 29. She does report history of
heavy menstrual cycles in previous years but that this is not an
active issues and she now only have menses very third month or
so. Her Iron studies where consistent with Iron Deficiency
Anemia. Stools were guiac negative. She has been referred to GI
for follow up colonoscopy.
.
While in the cardiac catheterization, they were able to pass the
radial cath easily initially, however upon reaching the upper
arm she had significant vasospasm and pain.  Calcium channel
blockers and nitro were attempted to relieve the spasm, however
they were still unable to pass the catheter.  The radial
approach was then aborted and the procedure was completed
through a right femoral approach.  She was then paralyzed and
intubated to aid with relaxation for removal of the radial
catheter.  The catheter was able to be removed and she was
transferred to the CCU.

On arrival to the CCU, patient was intubated and sedated.

[**2175-8-16**] Cardiac Cath:
1) Coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA,
LAD, and RCA had no angiographically apparent flow-limiting
stenoses.  The LCx had ectasia in the distal segment, but no
obstructive coronary artery disease.
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated
left- and right-sided filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 32
mmHg and an LVEDP of 32 mmHg.  There were no other features to
suggest constriction, though this diagnosis should be
entertained.  The cardiac index was reduced at 2 l/min/m2, using
an assumed oxygen consumption.  There was moderate pulmonary
artery hypertension with a PA pressure of 55/31 mmHg.
3) Left ventriculography demonstrated normal LV cavity size with
mild gloabl hypokinesis, with an LVEF of qpproximately 45-50%.
There was severe mitral regurgitation with a dilated left
atrium.
4) After the procedure, the right CFA access site was closed
with the AngioSeal device.  A TR band was applied to the RRA
site with adequate hemostasis.  The RBV sheath was removed with
manual pressure, with adequate hemostasis.  (See above for
details about initial spasm of brachial artery.)
.
TTE [**2175-8-17**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
