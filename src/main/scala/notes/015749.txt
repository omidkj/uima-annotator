Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**First Name3 (LF) **]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77831**] is an 84 female who presented to an OSH on [**1-23**]
with 2 days of abdominal pain without [**Month/Year (2) 5162**], nausea, or
vomiting at that time.  She was noted to be distended at that
time and had a TBili of 12, WBC of 19.  She was started on
levaquin and a RUQ US was done.  The US showed a dilated CBD to
2.2 cm with a normal gallbladder.  A CT scan was done showing
again a dilated CBD with numerous liver cysts, with the largest
located on the dome of the liver.  An MRCP was done at that time
which confirmed a stone in the distal common bile duct.  Of
note, her WBC count by that time was decreased to 9 and her
TBili was 1.2.  While at the OSH she developed atrial
fibrillation requiring a diltiazem drip which was converted to
PO diltiazem.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care/[**Hospital1 **].

IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated loops of small bowel with an
unusual bowel gas pattern. If patient's symptoms warrant repeat
radiograph, supine and upright radiographs would be useful to
evaluate for air-fluid levels.

IMPRESSION:
1. Streaky left basilar peribronchiolar opacities, which may
represent atelectasis or early bronchitis.
2. COPD.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA and RA cavity sizes.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Small LV cavity. Normal
regional LV systolic function. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%. No
resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is at least mild aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a

[**1-27**] [**Month/Year (2) **]:
Procedures: A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A 7cm by 10 fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was placed
successfully using a Oasis system stent introducer kit.

Impression: Periampullary diverticulum
Stones at the lower third of the common bile duct and middle
third of the common bile duct
A biliary sphincterotomy was performed. A biliary stent was
placed.

Brief Hospital Course:
84F admitted the evening of [**1-26**] from an OSH for
choledocholithiasis.  Her WBC count at that time was noted to be
14, up from 9 at the OSH, and her TBili was 2, up from 1.4.
Given her history of new afib, poor pulmonary function from
COPD, and choledocholithiasis, she was admitted to the SICU.
Her HR there was monitored and was noted to be in the 80s-90s
without medication.  She was kept NPO and her antibiotics were
broadened to Zosyn for better biliary coverage (from levaquin).
Given her distention, a KUB was done showing stool throughout
the colon.

On [**1-27**] she underwent an [**Month/Year (2) **] where a duodenal diverticulum was
noted precluding the gastroenterologists from removing the
multiple stones seen in the CBD.  She underwent a sphincterotomy
and stent placement and was instructed that she would need to
follow up in 6 weeks for lithotripsy and stent removal.  Her
home dose of prednisone was started at that time.  Of note, she
developed a skin tear at this time on LUE and LLE which were
dressed with adaptec dressings.  The zosyn was continued and she
remained NPO.

On [**1-28**] her total bilirubin fell to 1.5 with a WBC count of 14.
Her amylase and lipase were normal and she exhibited no signs of
post-[**Month/Year (2) **] pancreatitis.  Her diet was advanced to clear liquids
and she was transferred to the floor.  On [**1-29**] her WBC and total
bilirubin continued to fall.  She was put on a regular diet and
was given a fleets enema.  Her abdominal distention improved
after having a bowel movement.  On [**1-30**] she was discharged home
on a regular diet and on her home medications.  She will be seen
by a VNA at hom
