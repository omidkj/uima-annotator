[**2129-11-13**] Head CT : 1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Probable chronic deformity of the nasal bones and left
zygomatic arch. No definite acute fracture seen.
3. Punctate high densities in facial soft tissues noted - ?
foreign
body/surface debris; clinical correlation recommended.

[**2129-11-13**] C Spine : 1. Linear lucencies seen along the inferior
endplate of C5 and superior endplate of C6, as described above,
with areas of sclerotic change, suggesting chronic fractures. No
definite acute fracture or malalignment is seen. No definite
focal soft tissue abnormalities noted.
  2. Vascular calcifications along the carotid arteries
remarkable for the
patient's stated age.

[**2129-11-13**] CTA Neck : Patent major arteries of the neck, without
evidence of focal flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion.
  Opacification of the ethmoid air cells and the nasopharyngeal
secretions
related to intubation.

[**2129-11-13**] CT Torso : 1. Acute right rib fractures as delineated
above, without pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Patchy
peripheral airspace opacities in the right lower lobe could
represent aspiration or contusion.
2. No definite intra-abdominal injury seen.
3. Evidence of old trauma manifest as subacute right rib
fractures, bullet
fragment in the right paraspinal region in the chest, and
heterotopic bone
formation along the proximal left femur.

[**2129-11-15**] Head CT : 1. No definite acute findings to account for
the patient's symptoms. Relative hyperdense appearance to the
origin of the left MCA seen on one image only. Findings could
represent early vascular calcifications. However, thrombosis is
not completely excluded. No loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation to suggest acute infarction, however, CT is not
very sensitive for evaluation of such.
2. Opacification of paranasal sinuses and layering fluid in the
nasopharynx are noted in this patient who is intubated.

[**2129-11-15**] CT C Spine : 1. Age-indeterminate fracture lines as
previously described, with areas of sclerotic appearance
suggesting chronicity.
2. No definite focal soft tissue abnormality seen including
hematoma or
abscess.
3. Again there is normal opacification of major cervical
vessels.
4. Intubated with OG tube in place, with fluid in the pharynx
and paranasal sinus mucosal thickening

[**2129-11-15**] CT T-L spine :
  1. Questionable age indeterminate minor vertebral fractures at
C5 and C6 with no evidence for cord compression.
  2. Mild cervical and lumbar disc bulges causing no significant
stenosis or cord compression.
  3. Opacification involving the bibasilar lower lobes, likely
representing aspiration pneumonia or atelectasis.
  4. Bullet fragment within the right lower lobe (superior
segment).
Pneumothorax cannot be assessed as anterior nondependent
portions of lungs
not in FOV.

[**2129-11-17**] CT C Spine : Anterior fusion hardware with screws
traverse the levels at C3 through C6 with interbody grafts. A
separate lateral radiograph demonstrates a probe at C5-6
level. Please refer to operative note for full details.

[**2129-11-18**] CT C Spine : There is anterior spinal fusion of C3-C6
in image 1. Placement of posterior spinal fusion rods at C4, C5,
C6, and T1 are seen in image 2 and 3. The patient is intubated
and the tip is not visualized.

[**2129-11-28**] Head CT :
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Paranasal sinus disease.

[**2129-12-2**] Left upper extremity ultrasound :
Non-compressible left brachial vein consistent with venous
thrombosis





Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 284**] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency
Room, Intubated, scanned and finally transferred to the Trauma
ICU for further evaluation and treatment.  His pre admission
Dilantin was continued and he had no seizure activity during his
hospital stay.  He was evaluated by the Ortho-Spine service and
shortly after admission developed paralysis of both upper
extremities and repeat CT showed cord compression.  He
subsequently underwent 2 fusion procedures ( see operative notes
for details ). During his post op course he developed pneumonia
with sputum culture positive for Beta strep and MRSA. He was
treated with a 10 day course of antibiotics.  His neuro exam
gradually improved with cessation of Propofol as far as
tracking, following commands and moving lower extremities by
Post op day #4 however it took a little longer for his upper
extremities to move.

His pulmonary status was compromised by secretions and although
he was maintained on low levels of CPAP/IPS his intubation was
prolonged.. he was eventually extubated on [**2129-11-22**] however was
unable to clear his secretions and he was electively intubated
the same day.  On [**2129-11-24**] he underwent a percutaneous
tracheostomy as well as G Tube placement. Following a successful
ventilator wean and stability on a trach [**Last Name (un) **] he was
transferred to the Trauma floor on [**2129-11-26**].

At this point, he was able to move both hands and fingers but
was unable to lift his arms or shoulders.  Unfortunately he fell
out of bed on [**2129-11-28**] and underwent repeat CT of the head and C
Spine.  There was no evidence of a bleed and the hardware in the
C spine was in alignment.

From a nutritional standpoint he was tolerating feeding through
his G tube but developed hyponatremia and hyperkalemia with a
normal BUN and creatinine.  His feeding were changed to a renal
preparation and the Renal service was consulted.

Upon evaluation of his hospital course and lab tests they
determined that he had SIADH which caused his hyponatremia.
Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out. His sodium was up to 139
and his potassium was stable at 4.9 prior to discharge.  The
cause of his SIADH was potential
