[**2112-9-22**]
CT OF THE CHEST: The heart size is normal and there is no
pericardial
effusion. There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions with
associated
atelectasis. Calcification within the LAD is severe. The
pulmonary arteries
are enlarged, suggesting underlying pulmonary artery
hypertension. The aorta
is of normal caliber, however, there is extensive calcified and
soft plaque
throughout the descending aorta and particularly in the upper
abdominal aorta.
There is no mediastinal hematoma. No mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary
lymphadenopathy.

Aside from mild bibasilar atelectasis, the lungs are clear. A 4
mm nodular
opacity along the right major fissure and 2-mm nodule in the
right upper lobe
(2:17) are noted. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary
contusion.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, and adrenal glands are
normal. Multiple
gallstones are seen within a moderately distended gallbladder,
however, there
is no pericholecystic stranding. The left kidney is atrophied.
The right
kidney enhances and excretes contrast normally. The pancreas is
moderately
atrophied. There is a duodenal diverticulum containing fecalized
material
abutting the head of the pancreas. There are extensive splenic
artery
calcifications, and the spleen is small. Extensive ulcerated
plaque is seen
throughout the ectatic abdominal aorta, which measures up to 2.7
cm. The
intra-abdominal small and large bowel loops are normal. There is
no free air
or free fluid.

CT OF THE PELVIS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis
without
diverticulitis. Foley catheter and air is seen within the
bladder. There is
no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

There is a nondisplaced transverse fracture through the left
acetabular roof
in a transverse configuration. There are also bilateral rib
fractures
involving ribs five through seven on the right and four through
seven on the
left, all located anterolaterally. The chronicity of these rib
fractures is
indeterminate, as there does seem to be some amount of
remodeling associated
with the left-sided rib fractures. There is a sternal fracture,
also age
indeterminate, though likely old given the lack of soft tissue
abnormality in
this area.

Compression deformities in the thoracic and lumbar spine are
likely chronic.
There is a mild compression deformity at T6 with subtle
sclerosis and
impaction of the bone at the superior endplate, but no loss of
vertebral body
height. More severe fractures are seen at T8 and T11 with
approximately 50%
loss of vertebral body height at these levels and focal kyphosis
at T11. A
slight step-off at the left lateral aspect of L3 is likely due
to a Schmorl's
node. There are severe degenerative changes at L5-S1. No
retropulsed bony
fragments are seen abutting the thecal sac. There is no
paravertebral
hematoma.

IMPRESSION:
1. Acute transverse posterior acetabular fracture.

2. Multiple bilateral rib fractures and sternal fracture, age
indeterminate.
The lack of soft tissue swelling associated with these fractures
suggests a
subacute/chronic nature. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary
contusion.

3. Multiple chronic appearing vertebral body compression
fractures involving
T6, T8, and T11.

4. Severe atherosclerotic disease throughout the descending and
abdominal
aorta.

5. Incidentally noted diverticulosis, gallstones, and an
atrophic left
kidney. Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension.
