History of Present Illness:
This is a 59-year-old woman who has been known to be relatively
healthy who was admitted on [**2192-5-11**] to [**Doctor Last Name 63885**]Hospital in [**State 1727**] with the diagnosis of bilateral pulmonary
emboli. She had been feeling weak and fatigued
and had had some shortness of shortness leading up to this
point. She first noticed these symptoms about a week prior to
admission to OHS.
CT of the abdomen at OSH ([**2192-5-15**]) showed a 5.5cm right renal
tumor
with extension into the renal vein and IVC.
- PET scan at OSH ([**2192-5-18**])showed no increased uptake in the RLL
2cm
nodule but increased uptake in right kidney and in the left
hilum
of the lung.
- MRI of the head with gado at OSH ([**2192-5-17**])was unremarkable.
- MRI of the abdomen at OSH ([**2192-5-21**]): Thrombus locally
intrusive into the IVC but does not extend up to the hepatic
area
or right atrial area. She was anticoagulated at OSH, and her INR
was noted to be therapeutic upon her discharge and transfer
to [**Hospital6 256**].
At [**Hospital1 18**], she was continued on coumadin with therapeutic INRs.
Upon further evaluation, it was determined that the patient
could potentially benefit from debulking surgery. She presented
for right renal debulking nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy.



She went to an emergency room there and was found to have an
elevated D-dimer, and on CAT scan was found to have bilateral
pulmonary emboli. She was then admitted to [**Doctor Last Name 63883**]Hospital and was begun on anticoagulation and further work-up
proceeded. The patient received bilateral duplex ultrasounds
that were negative. However, she had a CAT scan of the
abdomen that showed a 5.5 cm right renal mass with extension
to the renal vein and inferior vena cava. There was also
noted to be a 2 cm right lung lower lobe nodule. She also had
a PET scan there that was noted to show some increased uptake
in the hilum of the left lung. In addition to that, in the
kidney. An MRI of the head was also performed that was found
to be unremarkable and to show no signs of metastases.

She was anticoagulated at the outside hospital, and her INR
was noted to be therapeutic upon her discharge and transfer
to [**Hospital6 256**]. The INR was 2.3 at
this time. Her history is also significant for depression for
which she is treated with Klonopin and Effexor, and it is
noted to be well-controlled by the patient and her family.


Past Medical History:
She is a G6 P5 with 1 abortion with a
D and C for miscarriage. She has reflux symptoms since age
26. She had a cholecystectomy in her 30s with 2 subsequent
episodes of bleeding where she needed to be reexplored.


Social History:
The patient's husband died from primary pulmonary hypertension
20 years ago. The patient works as a nursing unit coordinator at
the [**Doctor Last Name 35606**]Hospital.


Family History:
Mother died of lung cancer and she was a noted smoker. Daughter
had congestive heart failure in a pregnancy and delivered
prematurely. There is no history of
DVT or pulmonary emboli noted in the family.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: 98.7  HR: 93  BP  145/93  RR: 18  O2Sat 96% RA
Alert and oriented x3.  No acute distress, comfortable.
Heart is regular rate and rhythm. No murrmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Chest with mild end-inspiratory crackles at right base.
Otherwise clear, no wheezes.
Abdomen is mildly obese. Soft, non-tender except over incisonal
site. No rebout tenderness.  Staples and sutures are in place.
No erythema or discharge about the wound.
Extremities with significant post-operative edema extending to
thighes, back, but improving.  Otherwise warm and well perfused.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2192-6-6**] 9:24 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior study of a day
earlier. Since the prior study, there has been removal of the
right IJ line, no evidence of pneumothorax. Partial atelectasis
involving the right middle lobe is again noted as well as the
left lower lobe partial atelectasis. No hiatal hernia is
suspected. Some left pleural effusion is suspected in the
posterior costophrenic angle.

IMPRESSION:

Interval removal of the right IJ line and no evidence of
pneumothorax.

Areas of partial atelectasis involving the lower lobes
bilaterally as well as the right middle lobe.

? Small left pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 4229**] performed a right radical nephrectomy, removal of
tumor thrombus from the inferior vena cava and reconstruction of
inferior vena cava on [**2192-6-1**]. In the operating room, the
patient received 4600 cc of crystalloid, 14 units of red blood
cells, 6 units of FFP, 1 unit of platelets, 750 cc of albumin.
The estimated blood loss was 8 liters.  Post operatively,
patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for
observation, where she continued to do well. She was extubated
and nasogastric tube was discontinued. She was transferred to
the floor where her status continued to improve.  Diet was
advanced as tolerated and patient was transitioned to PO
percocet with oxycodone for breakthrough. On post-operative day
4 her epidural catheter was pulled, as was her chest tube and
central line. Her home medication regimen was continued once she
was able to take POs.  Chest radiography was obtained and
confirmed good re-expansion of lungs without pneumothorax, and
atelectasis at the bases bilaterally. Her Foley catheter was
discontinued on the evening of post-operative day 4 and she was
able to void. She was re-started on coumadin alternating
5mg/7.5mg QHS. On discharge, INR was 1.2 after one dose of 2mg
and one dose of 5mg.  She was given strict instructions to
follow up with her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 63886**] in [**State 1727**] this Friday for INR
measurement and adjustment of her anticoagulation.  She was
discharged home on [**6-6**] in good condition.
