CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress, aspiration pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80[**Hospital 4622**] nursing
home resident with recent community-acquired pneumonia,
dementia, chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension who
was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Nursing Home for
aspiration pneumonia.  On [**2163-2-17**] approximately one week
prior to current admission, she had an episode of shortness
of breath with a temperature spike for which she was started
on azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia.  Chest
x-ray at that time showed an opacity in the right upper lobe.
She improved on antibiotics however on [**2163-2-21**] she was noted
to have increased glucose to the 400s and sodium of 154.  At
that time she was thought to be dehydrated and she was
repleted with intravenous fluids.  On [**2163-2-22**] due to a
persistent oxygen requirement she was changed to Levaquin and
Flagyl for improved anaerobic coverage for her pneumonia.
Then on [**2163-2-25**] during breakfast she was noted to have acute
shortness of breath while eating applesauce.  She does not
usually have an oxygen requirement however at that time was
91% on two liters nasal cannula which improved to 93% after
suctioning of food from the back of her throat.

In the Emergency Department she was found to have a chest
x-ray with right upper lobe and right middle lobe infiltrate.
She was given Levaquin 500 mg x 1, clindamycin 600 mg x 1 and
Flagyl 500 mg x 1.  She was placed on BiPAP for hypoxia.  An
arterial blood gas during that time showed 7.27, CO2 of 54
and PO2 of 108.  Given a questionable history for congestive
heart failure she was started on intravenous nitroglycerin
for the hypoxia at which time her blood pressure dropped to
60/25.  The nitroglycerin was promptly stopped and with
intravenous fluid boluses her blood pressure improved to
90/64.

She was initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit
where she was transitioned off of BiPAP to face tent and her
oxygen saturations remained in the mid-90s on 40% face tent.
Cardiac enzymes were cycled and she was found to have a
troponin leak to 1.8, which decreased with subsequent tests.

pulmonary disease.  2. Gait disorder with falls.  3. History

q.d.  13. Combivent q. 4 hours p.r.n.  14. Sorbitol 15 mL
q.d.  15. Beclomethasone four puffs twice a day with spacer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission were
temperature 102.5, blood pressure 130/80, heart rate 129,
respiratory rate 36, 90% on room air which increased to the
high 90s on face tent.  On examination in general she was
alert but not able to communicate verbally while on BiPAP.
She was responding appropriately.  She was chronically ill
appearing but was not using any accessory respiratory
muscles.  She was mildly diaphoretic without evidence of
respiratory distress.  On HEENT her pupils were equal, round
and reactive bilaterally.  Mucous membranes were slightly
dry.  Cardiovascular examination showed distant heart sounds,
normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs were
appreciated.  There was no jugular venous distension noted.
Lung examination showed diffuse rhonchorous breath sounds
with a prolonged expiratory phase, decreased breath sounds at
bilateral bases.  Abdomen was soft, distended, nontender,
normal active bowel sounds.  Rectal examination showed soft
brown stool, guaiac positive, normal sphincter tone.
Extremity examination showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.
There was no calf tenderness or swelling.  There was mild
left medial calf erythema.  On neurological examination she
was alert.  She responded appropriately, opened eyes on
command and was able to move all four extremities
symmetrically.  She was noncooperative with the remainder of
the neurological examination.  Deep tendon reflexes were
2+/4+ diffusely.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission her white count was 25.5,
hematocrit 36, platelet count 286, sodium 147, potassium 3.7,
chloride 112, bicarbonate 22, BUN 22, creatinine 1.2, glucose
270.  CK was 92, troponin 1.8.  Urinalysis was yellow, 1.025,
pH 5, small blood, trace glucose and ketones, negative for
leukocyte esterase, nitrite or bacteria.

PERTINENT STUDIES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:  1. Chest x-ray on
[**2163-2-25**] showed right middle lobe and right upper lobe
opacity suggestive of pneumonia.  2. Video oropharyngeal
swallow study on [**2163-3-1**], results pending at the time of
dictation.  3. Transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2163-2-28**]
showed an ejection fraction of greater than 50%, poor windows
however no focal wall motion abnormalities or valvular
abnormalities noted.  No pericardial effusion, however mild
pulmonary hypertension.

IMPRESSION:  This is an 80 year old with a history of
community/hospital acquired pneumonia earlier this week with
likely aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis occurring on
the day of admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Pulmonary:  The patient was admitted for
respiratory distress in a setting of aspiration pneumonia
versus pneumonitis.  She was placed on BiPAP on presentation
and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit where
she was monitored overnight.  Her arterial blood gases
improved from initial blood gas of 7.27, 54, 109 to blood gas
the following morning which was 7.33, 47, 103.  As her oxygen
requirement had decreased and she was stable from a pulmonary
standpoint she was transferred to the floor where she was
kept on a face tent at 30-35% oxygen.  She was continued on
Combivent nebulizers p.r.n. with O2 saturations staying in
the mid to high 90s throughout the duration of the
hospitalization while on the floor.

2. Infectious disease:  On presentation the patient had
initially been treated with azithromycin for a
community-acquired pneumonia however she was transitioned to
Levaquin and Flagyl three days prior to admission for
increasing oxygen requirement and persistent fevers.  During
her hospitalization she was continued on Levaquin at 250 mg
q.o.d. and Flagyl was switched to clindamycin 600 mg q. 8
hours.  When the patient was better able to take p.o. these
antibiotics were switched to p.o. form.  Her white count
continued to be elevated during her hospitalization, however
she was afebrile.  Urine cultures and blood cultures were
both performed and were both found to be negative.

3. Cardiovascular:  Given her presentation of hypoxia and
history of hypertension, she was ruled out for myocardial
ischemia with cardiac enzymes.  CKs were not elevated with a
peak CK of 92, however troponin was mildly elevated at 1.8 on
admission.  The troponin returned to baseline on repeat
studies.

Given the slight troponin leak and her shortness of breath,
with a question of a history of congestive heart failure per
records from [**Hospital3 **], a transthoracic
echocardiogram was performed on [**2163-2-28**].  The echocardiogram
did not show signs of congestive heart failure with an
ejection fraction of greater than 50% and no focal wall
motion or valvular abnormalities.  There was some indication
of mild pulmonary hypertension noted.  Her blood pressure
ranged from the 120s to 140s after the episode of hypotension
while in the Emergency Department and her angiotensin
receptor blocker was restarted.

4. Neurology/Psychiatry:  The patient has a significant
psychiatric history including severe depression, anxiety
