History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 year old male with Lung CA in right hilum with mets
to adrenals who is transfered from [**Location (un) **] for PTX managment.
The patient has received 2 cycles of [**Doctor Last Name **]/Taxol/Avastin, last
cycle 25 days ago, unkown if neutropenic. One week ago, he began
feeling unwell with sob and fever, started on levofloxacin and
prednisone 40mg daily for bronchitis. He finished one week of
levofloxacin and was still on prednisone, but continued feeling
unwell. Per his wife, he did not have overt fevers but did have
SOb, sputum production and night sweats. She brought him to the
ED. A CTA showed no PE, but a large cavitated mass communicting
with bronchus intermedius. In the ED, he was coughing heaving
and developed sudden pain in chest. CXR showed a large PTX and a
chest tube was placed, with re-expansion of his lungs. He was
also given levofloxacin 750mg x1.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED: He was given Vanc and Levofloxacin. Thoracics
was consulted. He was noted to be oxygenating well on a
Venti-mask, but was more tachpnic and dropped sat's to 93% on
NC. He required dilauded for pain.

Pertinent Results:
A single AP upright view of the chest was obtained. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance. There has
been interval
increase in size of the right-sided pneumothorax, which is now
large, with
complete collapse of the left lung. There is no evidence of
mediastinal
shift. Also noted is a small amount of subcutaneous air within
the right
chest wall. A right-sided chest tube is noted in stable
position. There is a
small left pleural effusion and a small amount of loculated
pleural fluid
noted adjacent to the right chest wall. A probable small left
pleural
effusion is also identified. The left lung is otherwise clear.
An ET tube
terminates 7.7 cm above the carina. An NG tube terminates within
the stomach
which is distended.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval increase in size of right-sided pneumothorax, which
is now large,
with complete collapse of the left lung. Small amount of
loculated pleural
fluid on the right and a probable small left pleural effusion.

2. ET tube terminating 7.7 cm below the carina.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 year old male with metastatic NSC lung ca, fevers, WBC and
PTX.  Shortly after admission, patient's respiratory status
worsened and he was intubated for improved oxygenation and
ventilation. TV and PEEP were minimized so as not to exacerbate
pneumothorax. His large PTX was felt likely secondary to
broncho-pleural fistula from CA. The chest tube inserted at OSH
ED improved lung re-expansio; however, over the course of the
day, pt was found to have collapsed right lung. Also, he
continued to have large air leak which was putting out
serosangiunous fluid. IP and thoracis were consulted and he was
bronched, which revelaed a very large cavitary mass forming a
large fistula to the bronchus intermedius. A double lumen ETT
was attempted as well as purposeful left mainstem intubation to
help improve ventilation with minimal improvement. he was
intermittently paralyzed as well. In addition, the cavitary mass
was noted to be infected and likely the source of his continued
high fevers. He was treated with broad spectrum abx. Finally,
given the dire situation and his progressive hypercarbia, family
decided to make the patient comfort measures only. He passed
away peacefully at 5:15PM with family at bedside.
