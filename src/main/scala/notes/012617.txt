ADDENDUM:  Please see the previously dictated discharge
summary dated [**2145-7-9**] for prior hospital course.

HOSPITAL COURSE (CONTINUED):
1. SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  The patient continued to have
   worsening hypoxia during her hospital stay.  She was found
   to have further lung collapse of the left lobe on chest x-
   ray, after initial aggressive chest PT and initial
   bronchoscopy on [**7-8**].  We consulted pulmonology for the
   further evaluation of this patient, and she underwent a
   repeat bronchoscopy on [**7-14**], with suctioning of large
   amounts of sputum and mucoid impaction.  BAL was sent for
   further diagnosis, and grew out oral flora.  She was
   maintained on her vancomycin, and she received a total
   course of 3 weeks in house.  After consultation with the
   ID team, they felt that 3 weeks was appropriate treatment
   for her MRSA pneumonia.  She had marked reexpansion of her
   left lower lobe after the second bronchoscopy, and she was
   maintained on an Acapella valve as per pulmonary
   recommendations.  She continued to receive daily chest PT
   and Mucomyst nebs q 6 h.

The patient continued to refuse pulmonary rehab and;
therefore, initial dispo planning was that the patient should
have outpatient VNA and follow for chest PT, physical
therapy, as well as nebulizer treatment.  The patient had
marked stabilization of her oxygen back to her baseline of 2
liters with a range of 93-95 percent during her post
bronchoscopy course, and she was felt to be back to her
baseline.  She will likely need further aggressive chest PT
at home, Mucomyst nebs, Acapella valve continued use, as well
as ambulation.

1. CHF:  She was maintained on IV Lasix at 40 mg po qd, and
   she continued to be negative everyday for the remainder of
   her hospital stay.  She was afebrile for the remainder of
   her hospital course.  She had no acute exacerbation of her
   CHF.

As per the remainder of her issues, including hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and GERD, these remained stable on the
current regimen that she was on previously.

CONDITION:  Stable heart rate and blood pressure.  Afebrile
through the remainder of her hospital course.  BAL was
growing only an oral flora.
