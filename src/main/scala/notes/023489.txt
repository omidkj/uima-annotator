Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 8133**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-12-15**] for
management of his chest pain. He ruled out for a myocardial
infarction. He was started on Plavix, nitroglycerin and Heparin.
A cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed severe
left main and three vessel disease. Given the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
management. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner
and was ready for surgery.

On [**2165-12-17**] he was to the Operating Room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. Over the next 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He required low
dose pressors for a couple of days and a baseline random
Cortisol was 25.  Midodrine and Florinef were begun. The pressor
was weaned off and he transferred to the floor on POD 3. Beta
blockade, aspirin and a statin were resumed. Later on
postoperative day one, he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The Physical Therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.

Immediately after transfer he was found to have a glucose of
400.  He transferred back to the ICU for an insulin infusion.
This weaned off, steroids were stopped and he was stable.  .He
was begun on Lantus with sliding scale coverage and he
transferred back to the floor.  His glucose control was
improving, however, he was still hyperglycemic to 260 and Lantus
was increased to 15 U with SSI coverage.  He has unsteady on his
feet and unable to safely be sent home.  Rehabilitation was
discussed with him and his family and they agreed to a transfer
to such a facility for further recovery prior to discharge.  He
did occasionally drop his BP to the 80s upon standing, although
he was asymptomatic and it rose quickly to the 100s.

Arrangements were made for follow up after discharge. Wounds
were clean and healing well.

Restrictions, precautions and medications were discussed with he
and the family prior to discharge.  Arrangements for follow up
were made as well.
