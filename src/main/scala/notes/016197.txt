Nasogastric tube placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year-old [**First Name3 (LF) 24075**]-speaking male with h/o DM,
infarct-related cardiomyopathy, CHF (most recent EF of 50% in
[**Month (only) 359**], nadir of 20%), CAD s/p CABG x 2 ([**2091**], [**2099**]) &
biventricular ICD ([**2110**]), and chronic atrial fibrillation (on
Warfarin, INR 10.1 on presentation), severe MR s/p MVR in [**2115**],
s/p AVN ablation in [**2114**], history of CRI with intolerance to ACE
inhibitors and ARBs, history of carotid artery disease not
amenable to operation, and a recent history cellulitis and
erysipelas (finished a course of doxycycline at end of [**Month (only) **])
presents with increasing dyspnea for 1 day of worsening of SOB
consistent with prior chf exacerbations. Denies fever, chills,
nausea, vomiting, cp or back pain.
.
Of note the patient has had three recent admissions for similar
symptoms of dyspnea on exertion which improved with diuresis.
(d/c [**6-8**], [**7-18**], [**9-7**]). During his most recent admission, a CT
scan was done and demonstrated generalized additional
abnormality involving both lungs with associated areas of
ground-glass opacity, which had slightly progressed since the
prior study.  Overall, radiographically likely represented
worsening pulmonary edema, interstitial lung disease could not
be ruled out.  There were a few pulmonary nodules, have been
stable since [**2115-4-25**].  There is cardiomegaly involving the
left atrium and ventricle, pulmonary arterial hypertension as
well as cholelithiasis.  Echocardiogram from that admission
demonstrated an EF of 50% with a moderately dilated LV cavity
mildly depressed LVEF and the normal RV and normal right
ventricle aorta, minimal AS, MR, 2+ MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] that was
estimated as moderate.  Of note, eccentric jet of at least 2+
mitral regurgitation was seen and due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of MR could have been underestimated per report.
Spirometry and DLCO at that time also demonstrated moderate
restrictive ventilator deficit with a severe gas exchange and no
significant response with bronchodilator testing.  Most recent
spirometry testing is stable.  FVC of 1.29, 42% predicted, FEV1
is 0.94, 47% predicted; and FEV1/FVC ratio is 73, 111%
predicted. Overall, he has a stable restrictive ventilatory
deficit, no DLCO was done.  He saw pulmonary on [**2119-10-5**], who
felt that he does not have PFTs supporting COPD and stopped his
Advair and Spiriva.  They noted thrush that is likely secondary
to the Advair and gave him a 7 day course of nystatin.  He saw
his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2119-10-16**], who started him on Clindamycin 300 mg QID
for 14 days for recurrent cellulitis, however, he was not
tolerating the abx.  He was placed on Bactrim for 10 days (last
day - [**2119-11-9**]).  He was also started on Miralax for 17 g daily
for constipation.  Today, he was seen by visiting nurse today
for INR check but was found to be in CHF exacerbation (SOB,
edematous, 02 sat 87% on 3L, crackles 1/2 up. BP 110-120. Wife
reports that he has been coughing up dark sputum, not sleeping
at baseline 2 pillows at night due to PND. No fevers).  He was
referred to the ED by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].
.
In the ED: intial vitals were: 97.1 70 126/79 40 74% 3L NC. Labs
were significant for BNP 6843 and trop 0.02 (baseline), Cr 3.0
(baseline of 1.8), INR 10.1 and Hct 28.7. Physical exam was
significant were crackles at the bilateral lower lung fields and
erythema of the b/l lower extremity. A chest xray demonstrated
moderate congestive heart failure.   Guaiac was negative.  DRE
was notable for mixture of bright red blood and brown stool -> ?
anal lesions.  His saturation improved with BiPAP, however, his
sats fell to the 90 and he developed retractions on trial off
BiPAP.  He was given aspirin, lasix 40 x1, sl NG x2.  Vitals on
transfer: 70 107/74 33 100% on non-rebreather.
.
On arrival to the floor, initial vitals are 70 99/42 25 100%
sat. He is accompanied by wife and son and is dyspneic on exam.
His wife and son translated.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
