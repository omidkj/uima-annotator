CHIEF COMPLAINT:  He is a 62-year-old male referred for
outpatient cardiac cath to further evaluate aortic stenosis,
recently identified on echocardiogram and dyspnea on
exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He is a very active 62-year-old
who golfs frequently and has been a jogger until two years
ago.  Throughout the Summer he had been golfing 18 holes and
walking the course.  By [**Month (only) **] he had cut down to 9 holes
because he was getting so short of breath.  By [**Month (only) 359**] the
dyspnea on exertion had gotten progressively worse to the
point where he did not want to golf at all.  He denies any
chest pain or any shortness of breath at rest.  On [**2136-12-6**]
he had an echocardiogram to further evaluate his symptoms.
He was found to have an EF of15%, severe aortic stenosis
with mild aortic regurgitation and an aortic valve area of .5
cm sq and a mean gradient of .38 mmHg.  He also had moderate
mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation,
biatrial enlargement and pulmonary hypertension with
pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 65 mmHg.  He came in
and was referred for a cath to further evaluate.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant only for hypertension and
vein stripping.

MEDICATIONS:  Preoperative medications included Lasix 40 mg q
day and Aspirin 325 mg q o d.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 5.3, hematocrit 39.8, sodium
139, potassium 4.5, chloride 100, CO2 27, creatinine 1.2, BUN
18.  INR was 1.8 on arrival.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**12-19**] the patient underwent cardiac
catheterization.  Please see the cath report for the full
report.  Briefly, he had global hypokinesis, his EF was
10-15%,
normal coronary arteries except for the circumflex which is
70% lesion, one vessel disease, CAD, severe AS and moderate
MR.  The patient was referred to the cardiac surgery service
and pre-op'd for an aortic valve replacement and coronary
artery bypass grafting.  Prior to surgery he was seen by the
liver service and the dental service and prior to surgery his
course was complicated by two episodes of ventricular
tachycardia for which he was started on Amiodarone and has
been in normal sinus rhythm since.  On [**12-26**] the patient went
to the operating room for surgery.  Please see the operative
note for full details.  In summary, the patient underwent an
aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm pericardial tissue
valve and coronary artery bypass graft with a saphenous vein
graft to the OM.  During surgery he had an intra-aortic
balloon pump placed.  The patient tolerated the surgery well.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on Amiodarone
and Levophed and Propofol.  Later that night the patient was
extubated and did well.  On postoperative day #1 the
intra-aortic balloon pump continued on 1:1.  He required
inotropic support for a low output state.  We used Dobutamine
and he required Dobutamine for several days afterwards.
Several attempts to wean the Dobutamine failed because of low
cardiac output.  On postoperative day #2 the intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned and discontinued.  He continued over
the next several days to require inotropic support with
Dobutamine for low cardiac output.  Several attempts to wean
failed.  On postoperative day #6 the Dobutamine was weaned
off.  On postoperative day #7 the patient was transferred
from the ICU to Far 6 to continue the postoperative cardiac
care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next two days the
patient's activity level was increased and he was deemed
stable and ready for discharge.  The patient was discharged
on postoperative day #8.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Aortic stenosis, status post aortic valve repair and
coronary artery bypass graft times one vessel.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Amiodarone 400 mg po bid times five
days, then q d, Coumadin 5 mg po tonight [**1-3**] and tomorrow
[**1-4**], his INR is to be checked on [**1-5**] and he will be
followed up by his cardiologist for his INR, for his Coumadin
dosing.  Ibuprofen 400 mg po prn, Captopril 37.5 mg po tid,
Lasix 20 mg po bid times two weeks and potassium chloride 20
mEq po bid times two weeks, Aspirin 325 mg po q d.

Physical exam prior to discharge:  He is alert and oriented
times three, pupils are equal and reactive.  He has a small
scab on his lower lip.  His lungs are clear in the upper
lobe, coarse in the left lower lobe and fine crackles in the
right base.  Cardiovascular, he has a regular S1, S2, 2/6
systolic murmur.  His sternum is stable, incision has
staples, open to air, is clean and dry.  His abdomen is soft
with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities have 4+ lower
extremity edema.  His feet are warm, his pulses are
dopplerable.  His left intra-aortic balloon site is
ecchymotic with 4 cm hematoma and his right calf site is
ecchymotic with 2 cm hematoma and his bilateral femoral
pulses are palpable.  The patient will be discharged home
with VNA follow-up.  He is to follow-up with wound clinic in
two weeks.  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one month
and he is to follow-up with his cardiologist on Saturday to
