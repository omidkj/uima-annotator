Chief Complaint:
lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Biopsy of fluid collection


History of Present Illness:
58M with hx of metastatic bladder ca s/p XRT completed
carboplatin/gem [**8-27**], prostate cancer s/p brachytherapy, CHF
with LVEF (30%), HTN, DM, CRI, admitted on [**9-19**] to [**Hospital1 **] with
lethargy, hypotension (baseline 90s) with SBPs in the 70s-80s,
and leukocytosis.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 **] for further
management.

Patient notes that he was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] for
dyspnea and lightheadedness. Was found to be anemic, likely [**3-7**]
chemotherapy with crit of 23.8.  He received 3 units of pRBCs to
symptomatic relief. After being discharged on [**9-8**], patient again
developed lethargy and loss of energy over the subsequent week
and a half. Visiting nurse came to see him for transitional
issues, and patient found he needed help just to get up out of
bed. Diffiulty ambulating unless holding onto something. Felt
similar to s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3454**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] patient.

In addition, patient noted poor appetite and nausea.  Also felt
thirsty and dehydrated.  In addition, patient noted urinary
incontinence, urinary frequency, but with low urine volumes of
dark yellow color.  Felt that the urine smelled "very strong."

Because of these symptoms, went to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Was found to have
UA with 4+ bacteria, leuk esterase positive, 40 WBC.  UCx adn
BCx sent. UCx has since grown out 10-50,000 mixed gram positive
flora.  Patient also with urinary retention on admission (no
recent problems, per patient) and foley was placed, relieving
patient of blood-tinged urine x600cc. Was also found to have
acute on chronic kidney failure with creatinine of 5.6 although
without hyperkalemia.

CXR was performed which was clear. Labs were notable for anemia
(explained as chronic) with crit in the low 20s and leukocytosis
of 17,000, but without any evidence of ongoing blood loss. For
likely UTI, levofloxacin 250 mg daily was started.

On the floors, patient became hypotensive with SBPs in low 80s,
adn was transferred to ICU.  Patient also had RIJ placed and
received total of 5L NS.  Neosynephrine was started as well by a
house officer on the night before transfer, and BPs were stable
at > 100 (baseline in 90s). Repeat CXR after fluids did not show
any volume overload.  Also noted to have an episode of
bradycardia (known history of tachy/brady).  Also reported to
have bouts of nonsustained Vtach and bouts of SVTs during ICU
stay, although also asymptomatic. Creatinine improved with
aggressive hydration. Patient also says that his overall
symptomotology improved whie in the ICU.  Finally, on night
before transfer, patient was found to have large quantity of
liquidy brown stool; cdiff was sent, which was negative.

On transfer, VS were:
98.2 100 99/54 29 99%RA

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.
98.3 81 109/73 21 100%RA

Imaging:
CXR [**9-23**]
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**9-5**], the patient has
taken a slightly better inspiration, which may account for the
decrease in transverse diameter of the heart.  Dual-channel
pacemaker device remains in good position.  No vascular
congestion or pleural effusion or acute pneumonia.
Right IJ catheter has been introduced that extends to at least
the mid portion of the SVC where it is obscured by the pacer
device.  This was discussed with the ICU team when they visited
the radiology department this morning.

Echo [**2115-9-26**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF = 25 %) with regional variation.
Significant contractile dyssynchrony is present, with a typical
left bundle branch block activation sequence. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2114-11-13**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
slightly further reduced. Significant left ventricular
contractile dyssynchrony is present.

EKG [**2115-9-26**]
Sinus tachycardia with frequent atrial and ventricular ectopy.
Intraventricular conduction delay. Left anterior fascicular
block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2115-9-5**] the rate has
increased. There is frequent atrial and ventricular ectopy and
continued diffuse low voltage. Otherwise, no diagnostic interim
change.

CXR [**2115-9-26**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, the right internal
jugular
vein catheter has been removed.  The right PICC line is in
unchanged position.
Unchanged left pectoral pacemaker. The lung parenchyma shows no
evidence of pneumonia or other pathologic change. No pulmonary
edema.  No pleural effusions.

CT Abd/Pelvis [**2115-9-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Marked progression of metastatic disease with interval
increase in adrenal
metastases and multiple nodules within the left pelvis as
described above.
Small amount of free fluid in the right paracolic gutter.
2.  New wedge-shaped hypodensity within the spleen most likely
an infarct.
3.  Collapsed bladder with perives
