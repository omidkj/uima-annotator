History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 74 yo man with h/o non-specific colitisi in [**2-18**],
PMH CAD s/p MI, s/p prostatectomy, lung nodule/NSCLC s/p VATs
removal in [**10-19**] now with recurrent colitis, transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his colitis.  History obtained
from records, patient, and his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] has a history of colitis (deemed ulcerative colitis),
diagnosed in [**2146-1-12**] after having bout of diarrhea at that time,
per report, diagnosed by colonoscopy (see below in PMH).  At
that time, was treated with prednisone with improvment in
symptoms. Was symptom free until [**7-19**] when again developed
diarrhea, gas, urgency.  Otherwise no abdominal pain,
nausea/vomiting, fevers/chills.  Had progression of symptoms
from [**7-19**] to [**10-19**] with increased urgency, going to bathroom up
to every 15 minutes, awaking at night to go to bathroom,
diarrhea, gas, non-bloody bowel movements.  In [**2146-9-21**] per
report had a CT scan that was negative for colitis, stool
studies that were negative.
Patient was then admitted to the [**Location (un) **]/[**Hospital 1459**] hospital for
removal of lung nodule via VATS procedure on [**2146-11-4**], symptoms
of diarrhea/urgency were still ongoing at this time.
Post-procedure patient developed escalating amounts of diarrhea,
without any unstable vital signs, but also developed severe
abdominal distension.  This required NGT placement and rectal
tube placement.  Repeat CT scan per report demonstrated colitis,
most prominent in sigmoid and left sided colon, without evidence
of mechanical obstruction or ischemic bowel (per one report -
but also demonstrated dilation of bowel loops in large and small
intestine, no noted mechanical obstruction, per another report -
awaiting fax of CT scan report).  The patient was started on
solumedrol, questran, and made NPO and started on TPN.  Stool
studies for c diff have been negative multiple times, but he was
also started on IV flagyl.  His symptoms improved with these
measures and the NGT/rectal tube per report had a lot of
drainage, and after a couple of days he had his NGT and rectal
tube removed.
However, he is still having loose bowel movements, poor PO
intake, urgency.  Patient is therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and management of his colitis.
Besides the above complaints, pt denies nausea/vomiting.  Does
report chills, denies fevers.  Also states has developed lower
extremity edema during prolonged hospital course.  Also reports
some dyspnea on exertion which he attributes to deconditioning,
denies CP/pressure, orthopnea, PND.


Past Medical History:
- Colitis, ?UC, diagnosed in [**1-18**] with colonoscopy (by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 40066**]) after presenting with diarrhea. Per report that
examination demonstrated colitis involving the rectum, sigmoid
colon and left colon, with edema and erythema.  Inflammatory
changes extended up to transverse colon with less involvement of
the right colon, ileum not examined.  Left colon biopsies
demonstrated active chronic colitis with low-grade dysplasia
involving the left colon.  Right colon biopsies demonstrated
focal mild acute colitis without dysplasia.  Of note, 2 prior
colonoscopies performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80206**] in [**5-16**] and [**6-/2138**] showed
only diverticulosis of sigmoid colon and a diminutive
adenomatous polyp at 20cm.  Following colonoscopy in [**1-18**], pt
was treated with prednisone at that time with improvement of
symptoms.

[**10-19**], clean margins
- CAD s/p MI and LAD stent in 10/97 at [**Hospital1 2025**]

- Tobacco use
- Possible history of pancreatitis
- H/o prostate ca s/p removal (?)


Social History:
Patient is married, has 1 daughter.  80 pack year smoking
history, occasional alcohol use.


Family History:
1 daughter died at age 35 from metastatic lung cancer.  1
brother died of MI at age 45.  Family history of colon cancer in
his father who died at age 59.

ENT - moist mucous membranes
CVS - RRR, no noted m/r/g

from prostate removal for prostate ca), non-tender to palpation,
hyperactive bowel sounds

OSH microbiology:
[**11-6**], [**11-8**], [**11-16**] c diff - negative
Stool for O+P - negative
.
OSH imaging:
[**2146-11-15**] CT scan:  Diffuse small and large bowel dilation with
mild wall thickening.  The stomach is distended as well.  There
is trace amount of peri-hepatic ascites.  Ileus or infectious
colitis are favored over obstruction.  There is probably chronic
pancreatitis. No adenopathy, no free air.

Studies:
[**2146-11-23**]
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse wall thickening and loss of haustra from splenic
flexure to anus with adjacent fatty proliferation. Findings
consistent with ulcerative colitis, of indeterminate chronicity.
No free air, free fluid or bowel obstruction seen.
2. Status post prostatectomy.
3. Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion with related
atelectasis.
4. Bilateral peripheral reticular honeycombing in the visualized
lung bases. Comparison with prior study is recommended if
available.
5. Right lower lobe bronchiectasis with region of consolidation
which could represent aspiration, atelectasis or infection.
6. Region of spiculated nodular opacity in the right lower lobe
and also
subpleural nodule in the right middle lobe. Again comparison
with prior study would be useful for establishing stability.
7. Scattered punctate calcifications in the pancreas could be
related to
chronic pancreatitis.
8. Sub-millimeter hypodensities in the liver, too small to
accurately
characterize.
9. Rounded hypodensity in the right common femoral vein,
consistent with DVT, and appearing to extend from the deep
femoral branch at the level of the greater saphenous origin. No
evidence of thrombosis is seen in the common femoral vein below
this level in the visualized distal common femoral vein.
10. Sclerotic and lucent lesions in vertebral bodies. In this
patient with
history of prostate cancer, correlation with bone scan would be
recommended in the absence of prior study to establish
stability.

[**11-25**]: rectal bx: Chronic active colitis with ulceration; no
granulomas or dysplasia are identified.
.
CT a/p c contrast [**11-30**]
1. Diffuse wall thickening and loss of haustra from splenic
flexure to anus, consistent with ulcerative colitis, of
indeterminate chronicity, stable. There is no free air, no free
fluid or bowel obstruction seen. No siginificant change in bowel
apperance since [**2146-11-24**].
2. Status post prostatectomy.
3. Left stable pleural effus
