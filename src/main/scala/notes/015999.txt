History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18806**] is an 81 year-old female with generalized
myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], who presents from home with complaints of
worsening shortness of breath. She was last admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in
[**4-/2113**] with shortness of breath and gradual decline, at which
time she was plasmapheresed. Her shortness of breath was felt to
be multifactorial, secondary to mild restrictive lung
disease/COPD, MG, and cardiac contribution with mild diastolic
dysfunction. A CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism.
*
She reports chronic shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion,
with worsening over the past week. At baseline, she can walk
about 10 feet, and was able to only walk about [**4-1**] feet without
halting in the past week. She denies chest pain. She sleeps in a
hospital bed at home, with HOB elevated at 30 degrees or so. She
reports chronic LE edema, without significant worsening over the
past 2 weeks. Minimal activity. No cough, no fever or chills at
home. No recent travel (last flight [**3-/2113**] when flew from South
[**Doctor First Name **]).
*
She was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic yesterday, at which
time PFTs were repeated with ABG, which returned 7.44/41/56.
Plan was made to obtain an out-patient sleep study with
neuromuscular montage in [**2113-7-29**]. She was then seen today in
the neuromuscular unit, and subsequently referred to the ED for
further evaluation.
*
In ED, initial vitals T98.4, HR 88, BP 94/56, RR 21, Sat 98% on
2L NC. ABG performed 7.45/47/108 on 2L NC. A CTA was obtained,
remarkable for bilateral PEs. She was started on heparin, with a
heparin bolus at midnight. NIF checked, negative 34-44 cm H20.


Past Medical History:
1. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] diagnosed in [**11-1**], status post plasma
exchange, CellCept, Mestinon and prednisone. She last had plasma
exchange in 04/[**2113**]. + AChR Ab, EMG consistent with MG.
2. Thymus resection [**2111-12-1**] with pathology consistent with
follicular B-cell hyperplasia.
3. Severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Work-up with unremarkable
LP [**2111**] (0W, 0R, 24 prot, 82 gluc, lyme neg, VDRL NR, negative
oligoclonal bands, cultures negative), normal SPEP/UPEP, and
normal folate. B12 borderline low.
4. Essential tremor
5. Glaucoma
6. Mild restrictive lung defect, last PFTs with FVC 0.92 (39%),
FEV1 0.63 (40%), FEV1/FVC 68 (102%). DlCo 49% in 04/[**2113**].
7. Osteoarthritis of hands bilaterally
8. Urinary incontinence9. Preserved systolic function with
EF>75% on echo 04/[**2111**].

Social History:
Widowed x 15 years, no kids. She is currently living with her
cousin in [**Name (NI) 18825**], [**State 350**]. She is retired from working as
a supervisor for an insurance company in [**Location (un) 86**]. She does not
drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She smoked from one to one
and a half packs per day for approximately 30 years but quit 30
years ago.

Family History:
No history of myasthenia in family.

Physical Exam:

RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
[**2113-7-13**] CTA: There are filling defects in the right main
pulmonary artery, as well as right segmental pulmonary arteries
of the lower and upper lobes. In addition, there are filling
defects in the LUL segmental pulmonary arteries as well as the
LLL segmental arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 81 year-old female with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]
on MMF and high dose Prednisone, status post plasma exchange in
[**4-/2113**], who presents with progressive SOB, found to have
bilateral PEs on CTA.
*
1. Bilateral PEs:
Submassive, hemodynamically stable with stable saturation on low
flow oxygen.  Given her poor pulmonary reserve secondary to MG
and significant lower extremity edema, pt was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation and serial ABGs.  On arrival to the ED, her
p02 was 105, and no high flow non/interventional oxygen therapy
was required.  Pt was started on a heparin gtt, which was
titrated to a goal of 60-80.  Given her initation of
plasmapheresis as below for MG flare, coumadin was held pending
completion of treatments.  Her LENIs were negative and no
further intervention was required.  An echo was obtained which
did not show any RV strain or any clot in transit.  Pt was
transferred to the floor. She was maintained on a heparin drip
while undergoing plasmapheresis and it was difficult to achieve
PTTS within the goal range of 60-100 given that her
plasmapheresis extracted 60% of her plasma coagulation proteins
daily. She had PTT checks every 4 hours and was monitored
carefully without significant bleeding. After completion of
plasmapheresis, her catheter was removed and initiation of
coumadin therapy began. Goal INR [**3-3**].
*
2) Shortness of breath/DOE:
Likely multifactorial with neuromuscular weakness secondary to
MG, obesity, emphysema, and diastolic dysfunction all
contributing, with an acute exacerbation in the setting of her
bilateral PEs. She also likely has a component of
hypoventilation during sleep, and is scheduled for a sleep study
with neuromuscular montage to be done on [**2113-8-14**], in the
[**Hospital1 18**] sleep lab.  Neuromuscular consult requested the initiation
of plasmapheresis given her tenous status in their impression.
A Quinton catheter was placed and plasmapheresis was initated on
[**7-15**], with plans for 5 sessions QOD. NIFs were checked daily
with improvment from 30s to 50s. Plasmapheresis continued
without event. She was given an appointment to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] 6
weeks after discharge and recommended she continue current
immunosupression without dosing changes. She was also diuresed
for CHF and diastolic dysfunction with much improvement in
symptoms. Titrated off oxygen well to room air sats > 95%.

3) Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**]:
Continued out-patient regimen with MMF, Prednisone and Mestinon.
 Plasmapheresis for treatment of her MG flare as above.
*
4) Atrial fibrillation:
Unclear if this is a new diagnosis, she was noted to have Afib
with RVR to 140s with activity. She was started on metoprolol
25mg [**Hospital1 **] with good effect, well rate controlled and directed to
continue anticoagulation.
.
5) Anemia:
Chronic due to disease and blood loss due to oozing from
pheresis catheter and frequent phlebotomy
-she was maintained on iron therapy and hcts were checked daily
.
Prophylaxis:
Bactrim prophylaxis while on high dose Prednisone and MMF
therapy. Ranitidine [**Hospital1 **] was changed to protonix given greater
safety in elderly populations, colace prn kept bowels working in
order.
*
Code: Discussed with patient and her cousin, DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**].
.
She was seen daily by PT with recommendation for continued care
at rehab for stregth and gait training.
