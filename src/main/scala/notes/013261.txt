Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Repair of anomalous pulmonary venous return


History of Present Illness:
50 year old male with cardiomyopathy, CHF presents for repair of
anomalous pulmonary venous return.  He had a previous cardiac
catheterization demonstrating a right to left shunt.

Past Medical History:
Cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, gout, peptic ulcer disease, obesity, lumbar
surgery ([**2134**]), tonsillectomy

Family History:
noncontributory

Pertinent Results:
[**8-31**] Echocardiogram: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly
dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %). The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB:
1. Moderate to severely globally depressed biventricular
systolic function, which gradually improved to mildly globally
depressed with inotropic support. (EF = 35-40%)

2. Mild MR and trace TR.

3. A conduit/baffle is visualized in the right atrium emptying
into the left atrium through an iatrogenically created ASD. PWD
through the baffle shows pulmonary venous systoli/diastolic flow
pattern. There was no appreciable gradient at the ostium of the
baffle.

4. No other change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiovascular ICU after
undergoing a repair of his anomalous pulmonary venous return.
Please refer to the operative note for details of this
procedure.  He had a pressor requirement postoperatively, which
was weaned easily.  His chest tubes were removed on POD1, after
extubation.  He was transferred to the floor on POD 1.  His
pacing wires were removed on POD3.  On POD4, he was doing well
wnough to be discharged to his home after clearance from
physical therapy.
