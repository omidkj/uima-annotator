Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
VT storm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
78F with coronary artery disease s/p remote inferior MI, CABG,
and ICD implant originally in [**2136**] transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
with VT@180 refractory to cardioversion. Per the patient her ICD
fired "more times that I can count." Estimate by EP and EMS is
that it fired 15 times today. In the field she was found to have
Vtach at 180 and underwent 2 cardioversions at 100J and 150J
(with Versed sedation) then broke with Amiodarone 150 mg bolus
f/b amio gtt. In the ED the amio gtt was continued. She was seen
by EP who interrogated her ICD and changed several of her
settings. EPS reccomended DC'ing amio and starting lidocaine
bolus + gtt however when the ED stopped the amiodarone she had
20 beats of asymptomatic VT that was terminated with overdrive
pacing from her ICD. She was restarted on amiodarone and
transferred to the CVICU under the care of the CCU team.

Of ntoe she underwent EP study in [**2149-11-15**] for recurrent VT
and found to have larve inferior scar. No ablation becaue of
multiple runs of HD unstable VT during catheter manipulation.
She has actually been off of all antiarhythmic drugs due to
intolerance of quinidine, maxelitine and amiodarone).

She has had the ICD in place since 2/[**2136**]. By report her last
firing was 8 months ago. She denies any recent syncope or
presyncope, chest pain or SOB. She does endorse some fatigue.

IMAGING:
NONE

Brief Hospital Course:
78 [**Last Name (un) 9232**] with history of CAD and cardiomyopathy with EF 25% and
recurrent VT's presenting with VT storm, now in sinus rhythm
admitted to the CVICU under care of CCU team for monitoring and
manasgement.
.
# VTACH- The patient was initially stabilized on lidocaine gtt.
She was seen by EP and went for mapping and VT ablation.  She
had multiple areas ablated, but there were numerous areas of
ectopy that could have been the source of her VT that it was
felt they were not all captured.  As a result, she was continued
on lidocaine when she returned from the lab.  She started
mexiletine and the dose was titrated to 150mg PO BID.  She did
well on that dose and was subsequently sent home with the
appropriate follow up.
.
Inactive Issues:
# CAD: Continue statin, asa and beta blocker. Mild troponin
elevation is likley secondary to multiple shocks.  It improved
without any issues.
.
# HTN: Continue home antihypertensives
.
# HLD: Continue atorvastatin
.
Transitional ISSUES:
- Follow up with EP regarding further management of her
Ventricular Tachycardia

dofetalide, to prevent the ventricular tachycardia and this
seems to be working well. WE also made some adjustments to your

Dofetalide twice daily and will see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.
