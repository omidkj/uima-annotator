68 year-old female, ventilator dependent secondary to
[**Last Name (un) 4584**]-[**Location (un) **], insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, systolic
heart failure, recurrent urinary tract infections with chronic
indwelling Foley catheter, recent C difficile infection on
vancomycin PO admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for fever x1 week. Per
report, low-grade fevers began approximately one week ago. Blood
cultures were negative at that time. Patient was empirically
treated with vancomycin, Zosyn, and PO vancomycin. As fevers
worsened and associated with leukocytosis, Zosyn changed to
Imipenem.

Night prior to admission she was noted to have temperature 102.
She appeared lethargic and diaphoretic. She is usually very
interactive, but was not interested in verbal communication. She
was also noted to have WBC count 21.2, hematocrit 27.4. She was
also noted ot have diarrhea of unknown duration and thick,
yellow secretions from trach.
.
Of note, in [**6-5**] when patient was treated for VAP (LLL
infiltrate) and UTI at [**Hospital1 2177**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were T101.2 107 145/79 16 99 on CMV 500x12
Fio2 0.35, PEEP 5. She complained of abdominal distention. On
exam, she was rhonchorous with a nontender abdomen. A CT
abdomen/pelvis was order which showed no evidence of colitis but
concerning for pneumonia (?LLL vs. multilobar). Patient was
given given linzeolid for VRE coverage given persistent
fever/leukocytosis on vancomycin/imipenem, levofloxacin for
atypical coverage, Tylenolol PR, and IVF (1 liter). On transfer
to the ICU, HR 89, BP 92/41, RR 20, O2 saturation 92% on CMV
500x12 Fio2 0.35, PEEP 5.
.
On the floor, history is difficult because no volume with
patient's speech. Reports feeling tired. Complains of
intermittent headaches, sinus congestion, thick secretions from
