Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis and placement of pig-tail catheter in right thorax

History of Present Illness:
78M Myelofibrosis, Anemia requiring transfusions, Zenkers
Diverticulum, hx of aspiration PNA requiring intubation
([**5-1**])presenting with acute hypoxia in setting of large right
sided pleural effusions.
.
Of note the pt was recently admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital on
[**2117-1-2**] following a fall at home during which he had a work-up
for head trauma and syncope. ECG at that time revealed RBBB and
LAFB. Hct of 20.7, CT Head without acute intracranial pathology.
CXR revealed right sided atelectasis vs PNA. The pt was treated
for a right facial laceration and admitted. The pt states he
received 2 blood transfusions ans was discharged home from the
OSH after approximately 2 days. No discharge summary currently
available.
.
The pt states that over the past few days he has noted worsening
right sided pain that radiates to his chest. Worse with
inspiration [**5-3**]. No palpitations. Denies fevers, but admits to
chills. No diaphroses. The pt has had stable 1 pillow orthopnea
and has DOE upon walking up one flight of stairs. The pt today
presented to his PCP where he was noted to have a BP of 80/P and
subsequently brought to the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the ED 97.9 93/37 70 19 94% (02 not listed). The
pt was continued to complain of [**5-3**] back pain. ED exam was
notabable for absent BS on right. CXR with low lung volumes on
right. CT chest revealed effusion on right with mild ascites. No
signs of acute bleed.
.
The pt received Vancomycin 1mg IV, Levofloxacin 750mg IV x1,
Azreonam 1gm IVx1 for suspected right sided PNA in setting of
question PCN allergy. A PIV 18g and 20g were placed. The pt
received 2L of NS and 1L of D5W with 3 amp of Bicarb. UOP of
250cc.
.
The pt was seen by interventional pulmonary that who performed a
bedside ultrasounded throacentesis during which 1200cc of
serosanginous fluid was drained. Initial pH 7.08, pleural LDH of
468 indicative of an exudative process thus a pigtail catheter
was placed. Follow-up CXRs without evidence of pneumothorax.
.
Vitals prior to transfer HR 70 122/58 16 100% on 12L NRB.

Imaging/results:
EKG: RBBB, LAFB
.
[**1-12**]: CXR
Large right pleural effusion, with consequent lower and middle
lobe collapse.
.
CXR [**1-16**]; Two views of the chest demonstrate a large right-sided
pleural effusion with atelectasis/consolidation of the right
lower lobe. Left lung is clear. A chest tube is present at the
right lung base. There is little interval change with prior
studies. Hila and mediastinum within normal limits
.
CXR [**1-22**] (post pigtail removal)
There is a small right lower lobe pneumothorax. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, are unchanged.
Bibasilar consolidations and right middle lobe opacities are
unchanged, as is faint right upper lobe opacity.
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.
.
CT chest w and w/o contrast [**1-22**]
1. Marked decrease in size of now small complex loculated right
pleural effusion. The tip of the catheter remains within the
pleural cavity, but the formed pigtail is extrathoracic in
location with adjacent subcutaneous emphysema and soft tissue
swelling.
2. Slight increase of small simple left pleural effusion.
Persistent
pneumonia with component of coexisting atelectasis of both lower
lobes but improved aeration of the right upper and right middle
lobes. Nonspecific ground-glass opacities are noted within the
right middle and lower lung which may be related to infection or
reexpansion pulmonary edema.
3. Unchanged hypoattenuating hepatic and splenic lesions as
described. Many of the hepatic lesions are clearly simple cysts.
There is stable hepatosplenomegaly with sequelae of portal
hypertension.
4. Known Zenker's diverticulum.
.
CT chest noncontrast [**1-13**]
1. Decreased right pleural effusion, now moderate in size,
status post right pleural pigtail catheter placement. Small left
pleural effusion.
2. Multifocal pneumonia involving nearly the entire right lung,
and large portions of the left lower lobe.
3. Unchanged hepatosplenomegaly.
4. Unchanged appearance of probable Zenker's diverticulum.
.
CT c/a/p [**1-12**] c contrast:
1. Large right pleural effusion with resultant compressive
atelectasis or the right lung.
2. Hepatosplenomegaly.
3. Ascites.
4. Splenic hypodensity, not fully characterized, possible
hamartoma or hemangioma.
5. Nodularity of the left adrenal gland, but no distinct nodule.
This
finding should be correlated clinically and if indicated, with
serum
biochemical markers.
6. Collection of fluid and gas at the thorac
