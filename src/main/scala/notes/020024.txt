Admission Date:  [**2159-4-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2159-4-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2087-10-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Medicine [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 71-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for a 75 pack year
tobacco use, coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2152**]
with four-vessel graft, aortic stenosis, hypertension,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and COPD, who is admitted to
an outside hospital on [**4-6**] with complaints of eight hours
of back pain and urinary frequency.  A CT of the abdomen at
that time showed a 1 cm left proximal ureteral stone with
left hydronephrosis.  Patient was taken to the operating room
and a urethral stent was placed.  Patient was D/C'd to home
on [**4-8**], however, on [**4-9**] she developed dizziness and
palpitations.

Per report from a chest x-ray at the outside hospital, it
showed pulmonary edema.  Laboratories there were significant
for a troponin of 0.33 and a peak CK of 410.  EKGs there
showed prolonged P-R with ST segment depressions in the
lateral leads.  She was transferred to the ICU at the outside
hospital, given Natrecor, IV Lasix, IV nitroglycerin, and
Solu-Medrol.  She was diuresed approximately 2 liters.  It
was believed that her acute pulmonary edema was secondary to
ischemic event, and she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization here was done.  This showed an EF of
45% and 2+ MR.  The vein graft to the OM-3 was patent.  The
vein graft to the D1 was patent.  The vein graft to the RPDA
was patent, and the LIMA/LAD showed a 70% lesion in the mid
segment of the LAD after the touchdown with the LIMA.
However, during the cardiac catheterization at 5:35 p.m., the
Cards team noticed that she was not talking.  A stroke
consult was placed.  A stat head CT was done, which was
negative for bleed and she was transferred to the CCU for
further management.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed.  She lives alone.  She has a
75-pack year smoking history.  No alcohol.

VITALS ON TRANSFER TO THE CCU:  Temperature of 97.8, blood
pressure 151/63, heart rate of 77, respiratory rate of 30,
and she was saturating 91% on 100% nonrebreather.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Her neck was supple, right CEA scar noted, no
carotid bruits.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.  She
has a harsh 3/6 systolic murmur heard at the apex.  She does
have a sternotomy scar.  Lungs:  Diffuse wheezes bilaterally.
Abdomen:  She was soft, nontender.  Extremities:  Right groin
site was clean, dry, and intact.  There was no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Neurological exam:  She opens eyes and
she responds to commands.  However, she was nonverbal at that
time.  Motor:  She had limited right lower extremity movement
secondary to the sheath, but other extremities, which could
be examined showed 5/5 strength.  Sensation:  Grossly was
intact.  Reflexes were grossly 2+ throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  She had a white count of 19.3.  She had a
hematocrit of 33.9.  She had platelets of 207.  Her Chem-7
was notable for a creatinine of 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was managed in the CCU for the
embolic stroke, which occurred during her cardiac
catheterization.  She was started on a Heparin drip.  A Neuro
consult, which was called during the cardiac catheterization
continued to follow her progress.  However, the patient
continued to have an oxygen requirement.  She did have a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less than 18, pAO2/FIO2 of
less than 200, which was consistent with an ARDS picture.
For this, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for further management of possible ARDS.

The etiology of this ARDS was initially unclear.  It was
possibly related to amiodarone, which she had been on for
quite a long time.  She also has extensive smoking history
and COPD.  This could also have been maybe secondary to a
sepsis in the setting of possible pneumonia.  She did have a
bronchoscopy done, which was unrevealing and with diuresis,
her pulmonary status improved dramatically.  She was quickly
weaned off oxygen, and it was believed that her pulmonary
function was secondary to pulmonary edema and not an ARDS
picture.  The amiodarone continued to be held and her
Solu-Medrol, which was initially started of COPD was
discontinued.

She did have a repeat head CT for further evaluation of the
stroke.  That repeat head CT showed a hypodensity and loss of
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation in the left frontal lobe.
There was no evidence of shift of midline structures or
ventricular dilation.  These findings were consistent with an
evolving infarct within the distribution of the superior
division of the left middle cerebral artery.  For this, the
patient was continued on her Heparin drip, her aspirin, and
she was started on Coumadin.  Patient does have atrial
fibrillation and this could be predisposition for stroke.

The patient did have improvement of her neurological status.
She did regain some ability of speech and she was seen by the
Speech and Swallow service.  Her verbal abilities have been
improving slowly.  Speech and Swallow evaluation was done,
and they felt that she was not aspirating at this time.  They
did recommend soft solids as her dentures were not available
here.

Once the patient was euvolemic with diuresis, her diuresis
was held in the setting of her aortic stenosis as she is
preload dependent.  She did complete a full course of
ceftazidime for UTI and hydronephrosis in the setting of
placement of her ureteral stent in [**Month (only) 958**].

In terms of her cardiac status, she was continued on her
beta-blocker, her ACE inhibitor, her calcium-channel blocker,
and she was also started on a statin in the setting of her
stroke and her known coronary artery disease.  She was also
restarted on her amiodarone for her atrial fibrillation once
ARDS and her pulmonary status had resolved.

Patient will need outpatient followup for her cardiac disease
including her aortic stenosis.  Patient will also followup
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with the [**Hospital 4038**] Clinic here at the
[**Hospital1 18**].  She was also instructed to followup with her primary
care provider [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-12**] weeks.  Of note, the patient did have
Hemoccult positive stools in the setting of her therapeutic
INR, however, her hematocrit had remained stable during the
course of her hospitalization on anticoagulation.  Patient
obviously needs to be continued on her anticoagulation in the
setting of her stroke and her atrial fibrillation.

On the day of discharge, her INR was therapeutic at 2.4 and
her Heparin drip was discontinued.
