History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with a history of hypertension and recent weight loss,
who was brought by EMS to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED after her sister called
having diarrhea with black stools, and some blood, and having
body aches; "not able to drink, too weak to speak."
.
Ms [**Known lastname 13060**] is an uncertain and likely quite unreliable historian,
but does affirm that she has been feeling poorly recently and
that she has had some nausea and vomiting. She denies any
shortness of breath or chest pain; she denies current abdominal
pain; she denies current fever or chills and does not remember
any febrile symptoms recently.
.
In the ED, her vitals were initially T 99, HR 87, BP 151/68, O2
sat 96% but within a half hour of arrival her T was 103, then
100.9 one hour after that. A CXR was significant for a patchy
opacity in the R middle and lower lobes; UA was negative; had
"brown stool, guiaic +++". She was given levaquin 750 mg IV X 1,
CTX 1 gm X 1, and flagyl 500 mg IV X 1.

      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 25581**], R.N. ON [**2176-3-11**] AT 0400.

      GRAM NEGATIVE RODS.

VIDEO FLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION: In collaboration with
the speech and pathology department, an oropharyngeal swallowing
evaluation was performed. Barium of various consistencies was
administered orally to the patient under continuous video
fluoroscopy.

ORAL PHASE: There is moderate reduction in bolus formation,
bolus control, and anterior to posterior tongue movement.
Premature spillover was noted. Moderate residue remained in the
oral cavity following the swallow.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: There is moderate delay of the pharyngeal
swallow. Palatal elevation and upper esophageal sphincter
relaxation were grossly within normal limits. There is mild
reduction in laryngeal elevation, laryngeal valve closure and
absence of the epiglottic deflection. Mild amount of residue
remained within the valleculae and piriform sinuses.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There was no penetration or aspiration
seen on the examination.

IMPRESSION: Moderate oral and mild-to-moderate pharyngeal
dysphagia. No evidence of aspiration. For further details,
please refer to the speech and pathology report from the same
day.

AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Lungs demonstrate patchy opacity within the
right mid and lower lung zone. The heart, mediastinum, and hila
are within normal limits. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is
detected. The aorta shows atherosclerotic calcification. A left
apical granuloma is stable.

IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity within the right mid and lower lung
zones consistent with pneumonia or aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
PNEUMONIA - treated with IV antibiotics and then with po
levofloxacin to finish a 14 days course. Swallow eval as above.
Aspiration precautions and pulmonary toilet/ O2 as needed
recommended.

E coli bacteremia - pansensitive and treated with levofloxacin.
Repeat blood cultures negative.

Delirium - likely from the above issues. Improved with Rx of
infections. Per sister close to baseline at discharge.

GUIAIC-POSITIVE STOOL: History of guiaic positive stool for
which patient has refused work-up, and guiaic positive stool
now, in setting of weight loss. Defer work up to PCP.

Hypertension: Initially meds held and restarted prior to
discharge (Toprol XL, amlodipine). Dose of toprol increased.

Malnutrition: nutrition followed pt for caloric count and
supplements were added. po intake was inconsistent likely due to
delirium. Should get [**2-13**] assistance with meals and nutrition
consult recommended at rehab to ensure patient has appropriate
po intake.

PT evaluated patient and recommended rehab.

CODE: DNR/DNI (confirmed with patient, noted in past notes)
