Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] in the past, where she was found to have a
right hilar carcinoma likely arising in the middle lobe.
Evaluation revealed pleural carcinomatosis rendering her
stage T4 (3B). She underwent talc pleurodesis and has been
treated with systemic chemotherapy. She was transferred
emergently from [**Hospital3 **] over the weekend with dyspnea on
exertion, shortness of breath, and new atrial fibrillation.
She was found to have a new pericardial effusion which
progressed to hemodynamic significance requiring
pericardiocentesis. A pericardial window was planned for
management.

Pertinent Results:
RENAL U.S. PORT  [**2177-6-11**] 8:20 AM
FINDINGS: The kidneys are normal in contour and echogenicity
with no evidence of hydronephrosis, masses, or stones. The right
kidney measures 11.5 cm and the left kidney measures 12 cm. The
bladder was emptied during the study.

There is a small amount of ascites and gallstones are noted.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2177-6-10**]   :Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are grossly normal (LVEF>55%). Due
to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot
be excluded.

[**2177-6-9**]    [**-4/2337**]    PERICARDIAL FLUID :POSITIVE FOR
MALIGNANT CELLS consistent with adenocarcinoma.


LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2177-6-8**] 12:13
AM:Transabdominal ultrasound examination of the right upper
quadrant was performed. There is a 1.8 cm mobile gallstone.
There is gallbladder wall thickening and a small amount of
pericholecystic fluid. The common duct is not dilated and
measures 3 mm. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. Limited images of the pancreas are grossly
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Findings worrisome for acute cholecystitis. If
indicated, HIDA scan may be performed for further evaluation.
