1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are thickened.There is
moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse of the posterior mitral
valve leaflet with at least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] via transfer from an
outside hospital for further management of her mitral valve
disease. She was evaluated by the cardiac surgery service and
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. An echocardiogram
was performed which revealed moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation with severe prolapse and a normal ejection
fraction. A dental consult was obtained and after obtaining
Panorex films, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was cleared orally for surgery. On
[**2175-2-15**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she
underwent a minimally invasive mitral valve replacement with a
25mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**] [**Doctor First Name 7624**] pericardial tissue valve.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mrs. [**Known lastname **]
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Aspirin and an
ace inhibitor were started. She was then transferred to the
cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. She was
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with her strength
and mobility. She developed atrial fibrillation which converted
to normal sinus rhythm with beta blockade. A chest x-ray
revealed a pneumothorax without the presence of an air leak. As
she had a persistent pneumothorax with her chest tube on water
seal, the thoracic surgery service was consulted. Her
pneumothorax slowly became smaller and her chest tube was
removed on [**2175-2-22**]. A follow-up chest x-ray showed improvement in
her small right pneumothorax. levofloxacin was started for a
urinary tract infection. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day seven. She
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist and her
primary care physician as an outpatient.
