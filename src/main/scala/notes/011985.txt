Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old white
female with past medical history of coronary artery disease
status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft,
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to D1 and saphenous vein graft to OM1 in
[**2120**], re-do in [**2123**], congestive heart failure, with her last
ejection fraction less than 20%, likely secondary to ischemic
cardiomyopathy, mechanical mitral valve replacement, atrial
fibrillation (anticoagulated), status post DDD pacemaker in
[**2123**], status post pacemaker replacement three weeks ago,
hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,
complete occlusion of abdominal aorta, chronic renal
insufficiency, the patient is chronically on home dopamine
therapy since [**2126-8-19**].  The patient was in her usual
state of health last seen by the Heart Failure Clinic on
[**2128-6-21**], and had been in her usual state of health
until Saturday, the 9th.  On Sunday, the 10th, the patient
starting developing watery diarrhea and mild cramps.  She was
having about three to four episodes of loose stools a day.
On the day prior to admission she began feeling lightheaded
and dizzy.  On the morning of that day she was found to be
hypotensive and confused and found stooling in her bed.  When
EMS arrived to her home she was found covered in stool which
was heme positive.  Her blood pressure was 50/20.  The
patient stated that on the night prior to admission she had
felt chills but did not take her temperature.  She denied any
chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting.
Did not note her stool to have melena or bright red blood per
rectum.  In the Emergency Room she was thought to be
hypotensive so she was given one and a half liters of fluid
and her diuretics were held.  She is on 8 mcg/kg/min of
dopamine at home and she was given an additional 15 mcg/kg of
dopamine to which her blood pressure responded and went up to
the 120's over 70's.  Blood and urine cultures were sent from
the Emergency Room.  A chest x-ray was checked and the
patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further
[**Year (4 digits) 7941**].

1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2120**] status post re-do in [**2123**].

ALLERGIES:
1.  Sulfa gives her hives.
2.  Cefazolin and codeine give her an unknown reaction.
3.  Alprazolam gives her an unknown reaction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **]
alcohol use.  Smokes two to five cigarettes per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  She was afebrile.  Her
temperature was 98.1, blood pressure 68/34, heart rate 80,
respiratory rate 16.  She was 98% on two liters O2 nasal
cannula.  Generally, she was somnolent but arousable white
female, alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  Her
oropharynx was clear.  Her mucus membranes were dry.  She had
no lymphadenopathy.  Neck:  No jugular venous distention was
appreciated.  Cardiovascular:  Irregular rate and rhythm.
Normal S1, S2.  2-3/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at
the left lower sternal border with a mechanical click.
Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally
anterolaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended.
Bowel sounds are present.  There were no masses, no guarding,
no rebound, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  There was
no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Her pulses were 0-1+
bilaterally.  Her feet were cool to the touch bilaterally.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Her white count was 12.0, her
hematocrit was 29.3 down from the baseline of 32-33.
Platelets were 130,000.  Sodium 133, potassium 3.9, chloride
100, bicarb 17, BUN 56, creatinine 1.9, glucose 152.  Her CK
and troponin were negative.  Her INR was 1.9.  Liver function
tests were normal and amylase was normal.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  She was AV paced with a left bundle
branch block.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray:  She had normal heart size.  She had
a right subclavian in the superior vena cava.  She has dual
lead pacer.  No signs and symptoms of failure.  No pulmonary
infiltrates.  She does have basilar atelectasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for [**Name (NI) 7941**] of her blood pressure and possible
sepsis.

1.  Cardiovascular:  Ischemia-wise, it was possible that the
hypotension could have been due to an ischemic event although
this was unlikely given the patient had no chest pain so she
was continued on her aspirin, beta blocker, statin.  Her ACE
inhibitor was held secondary to her increase in creatinine
over her baseline.  Cardiac enzymes were checked which were
negative times three.  Pump-wise, her ejection fraction is
less than 20% last measured on an echocardiogram in [**2128-1-17**].  The patient appeared clinically dehydrated.  She had
no signs or symptoms of failure.  Her mucus membranes were
dry.  Her skin had tenting.  Her BUN to creatinine ratio was
greater than 20.  The hypotension could have been explained
by her hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea volume loss.  The
patient had been given 1.5 liters of fluid in the Emergency
Room.  Given her history of congestive heart failure and
ejection fraction less than 20, it was felt that more fluids
were not necessary and her diuretics were restarted that
evening in a goal to keep the patient uvolemic.  The patient
had no other volume issues.  Rhythm-wise, the patient had a
paced rhythm.  She was continued on telemetry.  Her
amiodarone was continued throughout her hospital stay.

2.  The patient has a history of mitral valve replacement.
Her INR was subtherapeutic on admission at 1.9.  She was
started on a heparin drip until her INR became therapeutic on
the 13th when her heparin was discontinued and she was
continued on her home dose of Coumadin.

3.  Blood pressure:  The patient was hypotensive on
admission.  She required increasing doses of dopamine.  When
she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit her blood pressure
was 120/70.  Her dopamine was weaned as tolerated.  She
required no additional intravenous fluids.  She was
maintained on her home dose of 8 mcg/kg/min of dopamine.

4.  Infectious Disease:  Given that the patient was admitted
with hypotension, this could possibly be a septic picture
given her recent Gram negative sepsis in [**2128-2-17**] with a
prolonged course of home antibiotics.  It was felt that the
diarrhea could have been an atypical manifestation of her
recurrent sepsis or possibly that this could be Clostridium
diffic
