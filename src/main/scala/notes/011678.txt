This is a continuation of a discharge that was cut off.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

In the MICU her anion gap rapidly decreased on an insulin drip
protocol. She was given a
bolus of Lispro insulin and started back on her insulin pump.
The patient was also changed over to D5 normal saline per
protocol.

The patient was transferred out of the unit on hospital day
cleared.  Patient was tolerating a diet.  She had her insulin
pump adjusted several times from 0.8 up to 1.0 units per hour
expecting a high amount of insulin resistance given her
probable infection.  The patient was not as insulin sensitive
and had a hypoglycemia episode down to 52.  The patient did
require constant monitoring of her pump and patient's blood
sugars remained in good control.  The patient was finally
controlled with a basal rate of 0.6 units per hour using her
insulin to carbohydrate ration of 1:15 and sensitivity factor
of 1:60 with good result.  The patient was then discharged to
follow up with her PCP at the [**Name9 (PRE) **].

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Patient had a white count on
admission as well as a nonproductive cough most likely
secondary to bronchitis, although viral infection was a
possibility.  Given the patient's DKA and high risk, the
patient was started on Azithromycin 500 mg p.o. times one day
followed by four days of 250 mg p.o. q.d.  The cough remained
throughout her hospital stay and did have some relief with
Codeine.  The patient was discharged home to complete her
five day course of Azithromycin.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Given the patient's risk for coronary
artery disease with long standing diabetes, the patient had
CK and troponin drawn as possible silent MI could induce her
DKA.  The patient's CKs were negative.  Troponin peaked at
1.7.  Given the nonspecific nature of this, it was felt the
patient likely did not have a MI.  The patient was sent for a
stress MIBI on hospital day #2 which was normal.  It is
unclear what caused her troponin leak, but it is not felt to
be secondary to coronary artery disease.

4.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient was initially started on
Metoprolol 25 p.o. b.i.d. in case she had any cardiovascular
disease.  When this was discontinued after the patient's
stress test, her blood pressure rose into the low 140s.
According to the patient's attending, her blood pressure has
been on the rise in the clinic as well.  Blood pressure
medications were not started at this time.  This decision was
deferred to the doctor at the [**Last Name (un) **].

5.  HEMATOLOGY:  Patient's hematocrit on admission was 42.
Her discharge hematocrit was 35.9.  This was felt likely
secondary to hemodilution.  Patient is on iron for an unclear
etiology.  The patient was advised to have her hematocrit
checked at her next PCP appointment where more history is
available.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is discharged to home with follow
up at the [**Last Name (un) **] for control of her glucose, blood pressure
check and hematocrit.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis.
2.  Bronchitis.
3.  Volume depletion.
4.  Anemia.
5.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Insulin pump with Humalog 0.5 units
per hour times 24 hours.  Insulin to carbohydrate ration of
1:15, sensitivity factor of 1:50 and follow up at [**Last Name (un) **] for
fine tuning.
