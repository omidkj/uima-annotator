Allergies:
Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Redo sternotomy/aortic valve replacement(21mm tissue valve)
[**2156-12-8**]


History of Present Illness:
80F with critical AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.7 cm2 by TTE [**2156-11-24**]), AFib s/p
successful DCCV [**2156-11-9**], SSS s/p PPM, endocarditis s/p MV
repair, and moderate pulmonary hypertension who presents with 10
day history of worsening dyspnea.  The patient has been having
shortness of breath for months, but over this span her symptoms
have gotten much worse. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2156-11-24**]
with continued c/o SOB and being unable to sleep lying flat. The
symptoms have not gotten any worse but have also not improved.
She was found to have mild heart failure but was in NSR at 75
beats per minute. She was started on Spironolactone 25 mg twice
a day and was given Ativan 1 mg. She spoke to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today
who has decided to admit her to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 for evaluation and to
have a cardiac catheterization with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2156-11-30**].
.
Today, she reports continued symptoms that have been stable
since seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on the 23rd.  She reports orthopnea
where she needs to sleep in her recliner at night.  She is able
to sleep with 2 pillows in bed until about 4am, when she
develops PND and moves to the recliner.  She denies any dietary
indiscretions or alcohol use.  She reports that she has had
swelling of her legs that generally resolves by the morning
which is not worse than previously.  No unilateral leg pain or
swelling, no chest pain or pleuritis.  She does report some
wheezing when she feels short of breath, but has no history of
emphysema.  She does have possibly a 5 lb weight gain over past
10 days, but patient is not entirely clear on this.

ROS: positive as above, otherwise negative.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Elongated LA. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast in the body of the LA. No
mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast
in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. All four
pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Critical AS (area
<0.8cm2). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve annuloplasty ring. Increased
transmitral gradient. Moderate mitral annular calcification.
Moderate valvular MS (MVA 1.0-1.5cm2) Mil
