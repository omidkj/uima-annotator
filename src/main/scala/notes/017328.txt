Chief Complaint:
Acute blood loss, GI bleed in setting of known GI stromal tumor,
transfer from [**Hospital1 **] after scope


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 78yo males w/known non-resectable GI stromal tumor on
Gleevex (dx [**2181**])PMHx significant for prostate cancer w/seed
implant, duodenal ulcer who presented w/weakness, fatigue, SOB
and was found to have HCT of 16. Pt noted symptoms of weakness,
fatigue and SOB on minimal exertion roughly 3-4 days prior to
admission. Denied chest pain or palpiation, no orthopnea, no
diarrhea or constipation, blood in stool or black stool. Did
notice some stool color change several days back after meal high
in iron which he and his wife assumed was related to food they
had eaten. Pt presented to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] from Oncology for
regular follow-up and potential change of onco medication and
was found to have HCT of 16. Pt was sent to the [**Hospital1 **] ED
where VS were BP 133/55 71 95% HCT 16, Hgb 5.3 and he was
admitted for GIB. At this time he had maroon color blood stool;
guaiac positive on rectal exam. Of note, CT [**2095-6-10**]* 18 cm
mass, progressed from prior images and pushing on duodenum and
pressing into pancreatic head also w/compression of IVC. Repeat
CT scan yesterday ([**2186-6-27**]) showed minimal necrosis in tumor and
no signs of frank bleeding in abdomen. Pt had EGD on [**2186-6-28**]
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]; this showed submucosal mass,
invading the wall of the duodenum w/bright blood in duodenum but
no peptic ulcer seen. He was transfused 5 units of pRBC and HCT
improved to 25.3. Last VS prior to transfer 116/64 79 95%
afebrile.
.
On transfer to floor, initial vs were: T 98.6 P 72 BP 124/52 R
13 O2 96% RA. Patient was feeling well, chatting and good
humored. No complaints. No pain no palpitation no abdominal
pain, no chest pain, no fever chills.

Images:
CT Abd and Pelvis [**2186-6-10**] [**Hospital3 **]
1. Interim enlargement in the 20x18x18 right retroperitoneal
mass. Greater compression of right kidney, right renal pedicle,
ureter, IVC, and greater displacement of the duodenum and
pancreas as described above. Mild right pelvicalyceal dilation.
No definite invasion of the neighboring structures, which
include liver, gallbladder, IVC. No definite IVC thrombosis,
although extrinsic compression is moderate.
2. Lesion shows central nonenhancement suggesting central
necrosis. Again displacing small bowel aneriorly in the right
lower quadrant. Compressing right gonadal vein, possibly cuasing
right varicocele.
3. Aortoiliac ASVD. Uncomplicated gallstone. Calcified pleural
plaques.
4. Small indeterminate sub cm left paraaortic lymph nodes.
5. Sclerotic appearance of the pubic bones, with small extra
osseous soft tissue structure seen adjacent, which are stable
since last year's exam. Possibly representing metastases and
extra osseaous extension, or anterior pelvic wall lymph node
w/out

CT ABD and Pelvis [**2186-6-27**] [**Hospital3 **]
1. Large reight retroperitoneal tumor known from prio exams not
significant changed in size. The high density material
surrounding a low density necrotic center consistent with
hypervascularity and/or samll bleed. However, the amount of
high-density material does not account for a significant drop in
HCT.
2. No other acute interval [**Last Name (un) 38815**] from the prior imagaing
studies.

GI scope at [**Hospital1 **] [**2186-6-28**]
showed submucosal mass, invading the wall of the duodenum
w/bright blood in duodenum but no peptic ulcer seen

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 78yo male w/known non-resectable GI stromal tumor on
Gleevex (dx [**2181**])PMHx significant for prostate cancer w/seed
implant, duodenal ulcer who presented w/weakness, fatigue, SOB
and was found to have HCT of 16 in [**Hospital **] clinic and ED. Found to
have GI bleeding in setting of GIST and transferred from [**Hospital 3856**] after scope for further management given concern for
progression of cancer and continued GI bleeding with tumor
invasion.
.
# GI bleeding in setting of known GIST: Pt was found to have HCT
drop in onc clinic and ED. Found to have GI bleeding and repeat
CT showed progression of known GIST. Pt was scoped at [**Hospital1 **]
which showed invading mass with bleeding. VS on transfer were
stable. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managament of GI
stromal tumor and associated GI bleeding. At [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient's Hct remained stabhle. GI, interventional radiology,
and surgery were consulted. Surgery recommended against
prophylactic embolization. The patient was treated with IV
pantoprazole which was later transitioned to PO.  Imatinib was
increased to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **].  His diet was restarted and his HCT
remained stable during his 7 days in hospital. He was discharged
to have
