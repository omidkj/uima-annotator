Pertinent Results:
CT head ([**2197-7-23**]) - bilateral scapula fractures, fx of right
posterolateral first, 4th and 5th rib, right pneumothorax,
bilateral opacifications likely aspiration, however
hemorrhage/contusion can't be excluded in setting of trauma

CT [**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2197-7-23**]) - No evidence of a fracture or malalignment
in the cervical spine. Nondisplaced left occipital condyle
fracture. The left occipital condyle articulates normally with
the left lateral mass of C1.
Temporal bone and skull base fractures are described in the
concurrent
head CT report. Nondisplaced fractures of the right first,
second, and third ribs, with a small right apical pneumothorax.
Biapical pulmonary contusions versus atelectasis.  Enlarged and
heterogeneous thyroid gland with a 1-cm nodule in the left lobe.
This may be evaluated by son[**Name (NI) 867**] when the patient is stable.

CT torso ([**2197-7-23**]) - Right pneumothorax. Bilateral
opacifications, likely aspiration, however, hemorrhage or
contusion cannot be excluded in the setting of trauma.
Comminuted right scapular fracture, left lateral [**Doctor First Name 362**] scapular
fracture. Left sacral fracture and superior ramus fracture. Left
clavicular fracture.

Bilateral lower extremity XR ([**2197-7-23**]) - There is no evidence of
acute fracture or traumatic dislocation. There is no knee joint
effusion bilaterally.  No soft tissue calcifications or
radiopaque foreign bodies are identified.

Repeat CT head ([**2197-7-23**]) - Stable subdural hemorrhage along the
left convexity, right tentorium, and posterior falx.  Increased
conspicuity of bihemispheric subarachnoid hemorrhage. Increased
nodular hemorrhage in left temporal region, which could
represent an evolving hemorrhagic contusion or nodular
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Multiple skull base and bilateral
temporal bone fractures are again noted.

MR [**Last Name (Titles) **] ([**2197-7-23**]) - Bone marrow edema in the left occipital
condyle at the site of known fracture.  No abnormalities in the
cervical spine.

MRA brain/neck ([**2197-7-23**]) - Technically limited neck MRA without
evidence of obvious abnormalities. While evaluation for
dissection or intramural hematoma is limited in the absence of
axial T1-weighted fat-suppressed images, there is no
irregularity in the carotid siphons to suggest an injury related
to the bilateral sphenoid fractures.

CT head ([**2197-7-24**]) - Stable subdural hemorrhage along the left
cerebral convexity and right tentorium with minimally decreased
hemorrhage along the posterior falx. Redistribution of
subarachnoid hemorrhage with less conspicuity of bihemispheric
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nodular hemorrhagic focus in left
temporal region is relatively stable in appearance and size
compared with most recent prior examination.  Multiple skull
base fractures and bilateral temporal bone fractures are again
noted.

CT head ([**2197-7-25**]) - Stable small subdural hemorrhage and few
residual small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Stable left
temporal hemorrhagic contusion with more prominent edema.

CTA head/neck ([**2197-7-25**]) - Questionable small dissection flap in
the right cavernous carotid artery near the known sphenoid
fracture, versus artifact. Aberrant right subclavian artery.

EEG ([**2197-7-26**]) - This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the
presence of a
slow background which represents a moderate encephalopathy. It
is also
abnormal due to the presence of bursts of generalized delta
frequency
slowing which may represent deep midline dysfunction. There was
left
hemisphere delta frequency slowing which represents focal
subcortical
dysfunction. There were no epileptiform discharges or
electrographic
seizures.

MR head ([**2197-7-27**]) - Hemorrhagic contusion in the left temporal
lobe. Several small foci of hemorrhage and diffusion
abnormalities in the white matter suggest diffusion axonal
injury.  Shallow left-sided subdural fluid collection is
slightly increased since the recent CT study.  Fluid and blood
in the bilateral mastoid air cells, sphenoid sinuses and the
ethmoid air cells from recent trauma.

[**2197-8-3**] CT sinus' :
There are soft tissue changes in the left sphenoid sinus, likely

related to trauma with blood products and small bony ossicles in
the floor of the sinus, which have slightly changed, but better
visualized on the initial head CT of [**2197-7-23**]. The right
sphenoid sinus changes are new, could be related to intubation.
Mucosal thickening is seen in the left maxillary sinus. No fluid
levels are visualized in the sphenoid sinus and in the maxillary
sinuses.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**7-23**]: The patient was initially admitted to the trauma ICU.  On
admission she was evaluated by Ortho Spine, Ortho Trauma and
Neurosurgery.  CSF leakage was initially draining from her right
ear but slowed down and per Neurosurgery required no treatment.
Per Ortho Spine was she was kept in a hard collar.  Per Ortho
Trauma her fractures were nonoperative
