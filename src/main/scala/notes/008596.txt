Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you developed dark
black stools, lightheadedness and nausea.  When you arrived in
the hospital, you were found to have decreased amount of bed
blood cells (Hematocrit), which was caused by a bleed in your
stomach or esophagus.  You were given IV fluids and Blood
Transfusions to correct your blood loss. You were given
medicines via IV to help stop the bleed and monitored closely in
the ICU.  GI doctors performed a procedure called endoscopy,
where they looked inside your esophagus, stomach and small
intestine and determined that your bleed has stopped.  After
that, you started feeling much better and have not have any more
symtpoms worrysome for a bleed.  Your regular diet and your home
medications were re-started.

You should re-start all your outpatient medications.  We made
one change - your dose of Protonix was increased to 40mg twice a
day.

You a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] (see below).

concerning symptoms, please IMMEDIATELY return to the Emergency
