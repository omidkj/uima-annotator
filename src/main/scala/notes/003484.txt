Admission Date:  [**2181-10-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2181-10-17**]


Service:  Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88-year-old
female nursing home resident with mild mental retardation who
presented to [**Hospital3 1196**] with a temperature of
103 degrees Fahrenheit per rectum, hypertension, and rigors
in the setting of one week of upper respiratory symptoms
(which included a cough) and malodorous urine in the Foley
catheter.

The patient was found to be hypotensive to 70/48 which was
unresponsive to fluid boluses.  The patient was given
moxifloxacin and started on a dopamine drip.  The patient was
also given vitamin K for an INR of 7.2 at [**Hospital3 20445**].

She was then transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department.  The patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit for presumed sepsis from a urinary tract
infection versus pneumonia.

A chest x-ray on admission showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate versus atelectasis.  An additional of normal
saline was given at [**Hospital1 69**], and
a central line was placed.  The patient was started on
Levaquin to treat pneumonia and urinary tract infection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin).
3.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
4.  Mental retardation.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  History of zoster.
7.  Urinary tract infection.
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Regular insulin sliding-scale.
 2.  Novolin 40 units subcutaneously in the morning.
 3.  Coumadin 2.5 mg by mouth once per day.
 4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day.
 5.  Lasix 80 mg by mouth in the morning.
 6.  Lovastatin 20 mg by mouth once per day.
 7.  Sublingual nitroglycerin.
 8.  Zoloft 25 mg by mouth once per day.
 9.  Iron sulfate 325 mg by mouth three times per day.
10.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.

ALLERGIES:

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed the patient's sodium was 147, potassium
was 3.6, chloride was 111, bicarbonate was 27, blood urea
nitrogen was 28, creatinine was 1.2, and blood glucose was
87.  Her hematocrit was 41.1 and her white blood cell count
was 36.5.  Differential revealed 84% polys, 11% bands, 2%
monocytes, and 3% lymphocytes.  Urinalysis showed [**Location (un) 2452**]
cloudy urine, large blood, negative nitrites, small leukocyte
esterase, and a few bacteria, greater than 50 red blood
cells, and greater than 50 white blood cells.  Serial cardiac
enzymes were followed with a documented troponin leak to 0.26
with flat creatine kinase levels.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission
revealed atrial fibrillation with anterolateral ST
depressions.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  HYPOTENSION ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with
hypotension secondary to sepsis from pneumonia versus a
urinary tract infection.

Initially, cardiogenic shock secondary to a myocardial
infarction was considered based on the electrocardiogram
changes on admission.  The patient was weaned off dopamine on
the night of admission and continued to maintain normal blood
pressures.  Serial enzymes were checked which revealed a
troponin leak of 0.26; possibly related to rate-related
ischemia versus a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.  However,
an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55%
without any wall motion abnormalities; which suggested that
this was not a myocardial infarction.  The patient was also
noted to have severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
on echocardiogram with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure
of 72.

The patient was afebrile by hospital day two.  She did not
require intubation for her pneumonia.  Her respiratory
examination continued to improve, and the patient was
transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the
medicine floor where she was weaned off oxygen.  The patient
was continued on Levaquin and was on day [**5-12**] total days on
the day of discharge.  Although pulmonary artery hypertension
was noted, the patient was not a candidate at this time for
prostacyclin and appeared stable off of oxygen.

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ISSUES:  The patient's rate was
initially high in the Emergency Department which was
controlled on a beta blocker after the patient became
normotensive.  The patient was on metoprolol 50 mg by mouth
twice per day on the day of discharge.  Her INR was
supratherapeutic on admission.  Therefore, vitamin K was
given and Coumadin was held.  The patient was restarted on
Coumadin 2 mg by mouth every day on the day prior to
discharge.  Her INR was 1.4 on the day of discharge.  The
patient should have her INR checked in one to two days
following discharge for adjustment of her Coumadin dose;
especially since the patient is on levofloxacin.

3.  HYPERNATREMIA ISSUES:  The patient was admitted with a
sodium of 147 which was treated in the Intensive Care Unit
with free water boluses.

The patient became hyponatremic on the General Medicine floor
after she was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit.
Likely, the hyponatremia was secondary to decreased oral
intake secondary to her decreased thirst in the setting of
illness as the patient was quite ill on admission.  Other
possible explanations included partial diabetes insipidus
versus a reset osmolalities which has happened in the past.

Given her urine sodium of 29, urine osmolalities of 391, and
serum osmolalities of 312, the patient was started on D-5-W
free water at a rate of 17 cc per hour for a total of 450 cc
in the first 24 hours to replete free water deficits slowly.
The patient should receive another 400 cc of D-5-W tomorrow
at the same rate.  The patient should also be encouraged to
drink fluids.

4.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was admitted on a
regular insulin sliding-scale and was continued on a regular
insulin sliding-scale in the Intensive Care Unit.  However,
the patient was then restarted on NPH on the day of
discharge.

5.  HYPERTENSION HISTORY ISSUES:  After sepsis resolved on
antibiotics, the patient's blood pressure trended up and the
patient was started on metoprolol.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to nursing home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  NPH 40 units subcutaneously.
2.  Insulin sliding-scale.
3.  External carotid artery 325 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Ranitidine 150 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
5.  Sertraline 50 mg by mouth once per day.
6.  Atorvastatin 20 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Levofloxacin 250 mg by mouth once per day (for five more
days).
8.  Digoxin 0.125 mg by mouth once per day.
9.  Tylenol 325-mg tablets one to two tablets by mouth
q.4-6h. as needed (for pain).
10.  Docusate sodium 100 mg by mouth twice per day as needed
(for constipation).
11.  Metoprolol 50 mg by mouth twice per day.
12.  Warfarin 2 mg by mouth once per day.
13.  Lasix 40 mg by mouth once per day.
14.  Sublingual nitroglycerin as needed.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to be
followed by the [**Hospital 2670**] [**Hospital 745**] nursing home.
