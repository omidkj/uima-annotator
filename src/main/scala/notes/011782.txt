History of Present Illness:
52 year old male with diet controlled diabetes, HTN treated with
lisinopril, active smoker who developed chest tightness and

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
single
and branch vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was patent.
The LAD
had diffuse 20-30% stenosis in the mid portion with a 70%
stenosis in
the mid portion of D1. The LCx was patent with a 30-40% stenosis
in OM2.
The RCA was totally occluded distally with an ulcerated 50%
plaque in
its mid portion and a 70% stenosis in the R-PL branch.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 20
mmHg.
There was moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with
a PASP
of 37 mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 5.7 L/min/m2.
There was
moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension with an SBP of
153
mmHg.
3. Successful suction atherectomy and direct stenting of the mid
and
distal RCA with a 3.5 x 18mm and 3.5 x 15mm Promus drug eluting
stent
respectively.
4. Successful direct stenting of the R-PLV with a 2.25 x 15mm
Promus
drug eluting stent. Final angiography revealed no residual
stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 flow. (see PTCA

comments for details)
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. single and branch vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Elevated Right ventricular filling pressures consistent with
RV
infarction.
4. Successful suction atherectomy and direct stenting of the mid
and
distal RCA.
5. Successful direct stenting of the R-PLV.
6. Successful deployment of an Angioseal closure device.
.
TTE [**10-14**]
.
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral and inferior
segments and of the basal inferior segment. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
one-vessel CAD (LCx or RCA). No pathologic valvular abnormality
seen.  EF 50-55%.
.
EKG [**10-14**]
.
Sinus rhythm. The P-R interval is prolonged. There are Q waves
in the
inferior leads with minimal ST segment elevation and terminal T
wave inversion consistent with acute or evolving myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing early transition is
no longer present.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the cath lab, pt was found to have thrombus and complete
occlusion of distal RCA. He underwent thrombectomy and stent
placement, subsequently he still had ST elevations and the
proximal/mid RCA was ulcerated and thought to be the culprit
lesion with embolization to the distal RCA. Hence, the patient
underwent placement of another 2 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] to the mid, and
distal RCA with resolution of ST elevations. TIMI 3 flow
achieved and 30% stenosis remained in distal vessel beyond mid
stent.
.
LMCA- no sig disease
LAD- diffuse 20-30, D1 70% mid
Lcx- OM2 30-40
RCA- TO distal, ulcerated mid lesion
.
During the reperfusion process the patient was transiently
bradycardic and hypotensive and was given atropine and was
briefly on dopamine but taken off prior to transfer.
.
The patient remained stable during his time in the CCU and his
CE peaked at CK 4100, troponin 8.6.  He had a few runs of
asymptomatic NSVT during the first 36 hours s/p reperfusion but
no other abnormalities on telemetry.
.
The patient was started on BB, ACEI, ASA/Plavix.  Initially the
patient refused treatment with statin as he has had myalgias
with several statins in the past.  After further discussion,
patient agreed to try low-dose Crestor (5 mg/d).
.
Smoking cessation was strongly stressed to this patient.
