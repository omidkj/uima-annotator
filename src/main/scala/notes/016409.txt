ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2172-10-15**]

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 35 %). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An
eccentric, inerolaterally directed jet of mild to moderate
([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

CAROTID US [**2172-10-13**]:

Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis <40%.
Slopped waveforms throughout likely cardiac in origin

CHEST XRAY
FINDINGS: No previous images. There is globular enlargement of
the cardiac
silhouette with evidence of mild elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure.
Pacemaker device is in place. One lead is in the region of the
right atrium.
The other is somewhat medial to the normal position of the apex
of the right
ventricle, though this may be just placed due to substantial
enlargement of
the left ventricle. A lateral view would be helpful for precise
evaluation.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION with Valvuloplasty [**2172-10-14**]:

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated no angiographically significant flow-limiting
lesions.  The
LMCA had a 30% stenosis.  The LAD had mild luminal
irregularities with a
30-40% mid-vessel lesion.  The LCx also had luminal
irregularities iwth
a 30% mid-vessel lesion.  The RCA could not be enaged, but
non-selective
injetion was without focal stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed significantly elevated
biventricular
filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 28mmHg and an LVEDP of
40mmHg.
There was severe pulmonary hypertension, with a PA sysolic
pressure of
84mmHg.  The cardiac index was reduced at 1.49 L/min/m2.  There
was
critical aortic stenosis, with a valculated valve area of
0.27cm2 with a
peak to peak simultaneous gradient of 38.6 mmHg across the
aortic valve.
3.  The ascending aorta and aortic arch were showed significant
calcification on fluroscopy.
4.  During the procedure with the double-lumen pigtail across
the aortic
valve, the patient developed severe respiratory distress
requiring
elective intubation.
5. Successful emergent aortic valvuloplasty with a 20mm x5cm
Tyshak II
balloon using two inflations resulting in significant
improvement in
filling pressures and aortic valve area. LVEDP decreased to
25mmHg, CO
increased to 4.38 L/min and due to decrease in systolic ejection
period,
the aortic valve area increased to 0.8 cm2.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Critical aortic stenosis.
3. Severe cardiac dysfunction, with a reduced cardiac index,
severely
elevated left and right sided filling pressures consistent with
cardiogenic shock.
4. Successful emergent aortic valvuloplasty with 20mm Tyshak II
balloon
with improvement in hemodyanmics.
5. Elective intubation.


CT Thorax non-Contrast [**2172-10-16**]:
IMPRESSION
1. Heavy burden of calcific plaque in the ascending aorta
without aneurysm,
intramural hematoma, or mediastinal hematoma.
2. Enlargement of the main and right and left pulmonary arteries
consistent
with pulmonary hypertension.
3. Bilateral small pleural effusions, right slightly larger than
left.
4. Multiple bilateral nonspecific 3-6 mm ground glass pulmonary
nodules.
5. 2.7-cm left adrenal lesion, most probably an adenoma, to be
confirmed with
dedicated MRI or CT scan of the adrenals.

CXR [**2172-10-20**]

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
