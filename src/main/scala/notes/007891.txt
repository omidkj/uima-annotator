Admission Date:  [**2170-4-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2170-5-8**]


Service:  CCU

ADDENDUM:

After initially preparing the patient for rehabilitation as
indicated in the first part of this discharge summary, it was
decided to keep the patient for further monitoring.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  (continued)  After the patient's diuretics
were held for about four days, her creatinine returned to
baseline but she was found somnolent in the morning.
Arterial blood gases revealed a pH of about 7.2, pCO2 144 and
pO2 of 45.  The patient was started on BiPAP and was
diuresed.  She turned around within 24 hours and was returned
back to the floor.  She had been transferred briefly to the
unit so that she could be maintained on BiPAP.  After
returning to the floor, her mental status continued to wax
and wane likely secondary to depression.  She can become
nearly unresponsive with her bouts of depression and can be
easily confused for hypercarbia.  The patient was eventually
stabilized on a diuretic regimen of 2 mg p.o. once daily of
Bumex.  Her creatinine remained stable on this regimen and
she had no further episodes of unresponsiveness due to
hypercarbia.  Her ace inhibitor continues to be held because
her blood pressure is normal and we do not want to further
insult her kidneys given that her creatinine tends to rise
quite easily with diuresis.

Pulmonary consultation was called during this patient's
hospitalization and they became quite involved in her care.
They were able to offer the following evaluation of her
pulmonary status:  She has a primary respiratory acidosis
with a primary metabolic alkalosis and a compensatory
metabolic alkalosis.  Her primary respiratory acidosis is
primarily secondary to her severe emphysema which increases
her work of breathing as well as bilateral pleural effusions
which further increase her work of breathing.  Also, her
increased pCO2 is secondary to decreased respiratory drive
which is due in part to hyperoxia. A pO2 greater than 65 and
an oxygen saturation of greater than 93% would be probably
the best to hope for in this patient without causing a
further decrease in her respiratory drive.  Diuresis of this
patient has also created a primary metabolic alkalosis which
permits her pH to increase such that her drive to breathe is
further decreased which further exacerbates increased pCO2.
It should be noted that this patient is a chronic CO2
retained with a baseline CO2 in the low 40s.  Her CO2 did
rise to 52 during this hospitalization for the above
mentioned reasons.  Also for the above mentioned reasons, it
is thought that too much supplementary oxygen may dangerously
increase her pCO2.  Oxygen supplementation of one to two
liters by nasal cannula should permit adequate oxygenation of
mental status while she is awake.  It was also suggested by
pulmonary that her target potassium be 5.0 in order to
decrease her alkalosis.  They also recommended increasing her
dose of Flovent to four puffs twice a day.

Psychiatry also saw the patient in house given that she has
not had any psychiatric follow-up presumably since her
hospitalization in the psychiatric geriatric unit.  Her
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status is presumed secondary to
depression which she has been diagnosed with in the past.
The patient can become confused with hypercarbia which
closely mimics her decreased responsiveness with
exacerbations of her depression.  Psychiatry felt that the
patient was doing well on her current regimen of Celexa and
Zyprexa and recommended discontinuing Ativan and Ambien.
This was done while the patient was in house.  They also
recommend psychiatric follow-up while the patient is
hospitalized at rehabilitation and suggested the patient's
family consider an option such as [**Doctor First Name 1191**] Day Hospital if and
when the patient ultimately makes it back home.  Again, this
patient does need psychiatric follow-up while she is in
rehabilitation.

The patient is a very big fall risk.  She fell about four
times while in house but managed to avoid injury.  At the
time of discharge, she has no neurological deficits and is
alert and oriented and is mentating well.  She did sustain
several skin tears during her falls much in part due to
attempts to hold her up.  Her skin is very brittle and it
tears very easily.  She was seen by a skin care nurse and
appropriate care of her skin tears was taken.

The patient was also transfused with packed red blood cells
to maintain her hematocrit greater than 28.0.  She was
continued on Digoxin for her atrial fibrillation.  Despite
her falls, she was also continued on low dose Coumadin 2 mg
p.o. q.h.s. to maintain an INR of 1.5 to 2.0 given recent
evidence that this range of INR can be effective for
preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation patients while
decreasing the risk of bleeding if they are a fall risk.  Her
ace inhibitor is being held due to her tenuous renal function
with diuresis.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable for discharge to
rehabilitation unit with psychiatric follow-up.  Her primary
cardiologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who will continue to follow
