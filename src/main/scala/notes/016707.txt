Transthoracic Echo:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6.The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2157-2-15**], the MR is now slightly greater, and the
PA pressures substantially greater than previously reported.

FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest show a new posterior
left lower lobe opacity and retrocardiac atelectasis.
Additionally, there is mild cardiac enlargement and increased
pulmonary vascular markings. There is a small left-sided pleural
effusion. The aorta is somewhat unfolded. The osseous structures
are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Mild cardiac failure. New left lower lobe pneumonia


Brief Hospital Course:
ID: Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**] was admitted for listeria bacteremia. She was
started on vancomycin and erythromycin, which are
bacteriostatic, and as such second line agents. It was not
possible to start her on ampicillin, the first line [**Doctor Last Name 360**], since
she has a history of urticaria to this drug. Although she had no
murmur, a transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained to evaluate
for endocarditis. She was found to have no vegetations on the
valves. While Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**] had no CNS signs, at times CNS
involvement can present inocuously at first. A lumbar puncture
was performed to determine if she had any involvement of the
central nervous system. It showed 3 white cells and 8 red cells,
consistent with inflammation throughout the body but not
specific for meningitis. On hospital day 2, Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**]
developed a nonproductive cough, crackles and wheezes on
auscultation, and desaturated to 89% on room air. A chest x ray
was obtained which revealed a new left lower lobe pneumonia. It
was thought that this was a manifestation of the listeria,
although the only other reported cases were in the setting of
immunocompromise, which Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**] is not. Tessalon drops
were administered for the cough and albuterol inhalers were
offered for the bronchoconstriction. Once desensitized to
ampicillin, the antibiotic course was continued back on the
regular floor.

Allergy: Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 96868**] stated that she had taken penicillin and
sulfa drugs in combination several years previously. She
finished the course, but experienced the onset of urticaria
within 2 weeks. This sequence of events reocurred the next time
she was prescribed these drugs and is consistent with a type III
hypersensitivity reaction. The allergy and immunology service
was consulted to aid in desensitizing her to ampicillin, the
first line drug for listeria. She was admitted overnight to the
intensive care unit for closer monitoring as the ampicillin was
administerd in sequentially increasing doses. The
desensitization was uneventful, following which, Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 96868**]
was admitted back to the floor. She continued to receive
ampicillin throughout her stay and experienced no reactions to
the drug. The patient was advised to be vigilant for reoccurance
of a type III reaction 2 weeks after the end of the course.

Cardiology: Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**] has paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
that has been well controlled with amiodarone and she has also
been anticoagulated on coumadin. She presented with a
supratherapeutic INR which was reversed with FFP and Vit K in
order to do the lumbar puncture. She was in normal sinus rhythm
until her admission to the intensive care unit for her
desensitization. At times over the 48 hour period, Ms.
[**Known lastname 96869**] rate went up to the 130's but she always remained
asymptomatic. However, a chest x ray was obtained that was
consistent with minor failure and per report, the patient stated
that she felt worse lying down. However, aggressive IV fluids
were never administered during her course, and no JVD nor pedal
edema was appreciated by this intern. Her coughing and crackles
and chest x ray findings seemed more consistent with her
resolving pneumonia. Her warfarin was restarted as was
enoxaparin, in order to prevent formation of a thrombus prior to
DC cardioversion.  She was unsuccessfully cardioverted on [**8-31**]
after three attempts.  She was then started on a higher
Amiodarone dose of 400mg daily, and Lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She
was also diuresed with 20 mg IV Lasix, with a good response of
>1lit of urine.  The following day, she spontaneously converted
to sinus rhythm.

FEN: Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**] was on a cardiac diet and tolerated it well.
Her aggressive home bowel regimen was continued. The patient's
electrolytes were checked and repleted as necessary.

Muscluloskeletal: Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**] has stable osteoarthritis on
rofecoxib. However, the FDA pulled the drug off the market
during her hospitalization. The drug was discontinued and she
was sent to the rehabilitation facility on celecoxib. The
patient has stable osteopenia. Her home regimen of alendronate,
calcium, and vitamin D was continued.

Ms. [**Known lastname 96867**] was discharged in good condidtion to Health
Bridges where she will continue her antibiotic regimen until
[**9-8**].
