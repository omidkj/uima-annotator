Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
T6 burst fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2141-4-11**]: T3-T9 posterior instrumented fusion


History of Present Illness:
78 y/o female with PMHx Parkinsons disease, COPD on home O2 2L,
4.2cm thoracic aortic aneurysm, CHF, depression,
hypercholesterolemia, hx L5-S1 discectomy, R TKA years ago,
peripheral neuropathy who is POD #3 s/p T3-T9 arthrodesis and
instrumentation.  The patient has had multiple visits to OSH EDs
for low back pain starting in mid [**Month (only) **] and was initially
treated with rehabilitation.  At the rehab facility, she
developed progressive weakness of her lower extremity and bowel
and bladder incontinence.  She was transfered back to the ED of
[**Hospital **] hospital where CXR done showed burst fracture of T6 with
retropulsed fragment causing narrowing of the canal in that
area.  She was then transfered to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2141-4-11**].  There was
marked blood loss in surgery but she was hemodynamically stable
the entire long surgery.  She was transfused  2 PBRCs for oozing
from surgical site. (No hct drop).  She self extubated the
morning after surgery.  Ortho felt that surgery was done too
late.  She has intact sensation but toes are upgoing B/L, and
she is now paralyzed from waist down.
.
Other complicating factors since she has been in the TICU
include UTI, A fib, and hypoxia.   She is being treated with
Augmentin for the UTI.  The patient had an episode of Afib last
night (first known episode).  This was thought to be secondary
to overdiuresis.  The patient's heart rate never got above
105bpm.  The ICU team gave intermittent lopressor 5 mg IV, then
started lopressor 12.5 mg tid PO.  Currently more hypoxic than
baseline felt to be [**2-21**] to volume overload  (on 4L).  She
diuresed 1L to 20 IV lasix.  She received an IVC filter today
prophylactically (no DVTs).  The patient was to be called out of
the unit yesterday, however had an episode of hypotension,
unclear etiology, possibly not correlating non-invasive to
invasive monitoring.  Hypotension has resolved and the patient
is being transferred to medicine for continued care.
.
On transfer vs were 97.2 82 103/56 17 98% on 3L.  Patient
complains of some back pain, but is otherwise feeling well.
Very frustrated about her current situation.  Feels bloated and
gassy as well.

Pertinent Results:
CT C/T/L spine ([**2141-4-11**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe compression fracture of T6 vertebral body with
retropulsion causing narrowing of the spinal canal.
2. Bilateral sixth rib fractures at the costovertebral
junctions.
3. Right sacral fracture. Recommend a pelvis CT to assess for
associated fractures. This was discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the
MICU at 8:50 am on [**2141-4-11**].
4. Lumbar spondylosis with moderate multilevel neural foraminal
narrowing.  Grade I anterolisthesis at L3-4 is likely related to
facet arthropathy. Grade I anterolisthesis at L5-S1 secondary to
bilateral L5 pars defects.
5. Left renal cystic lesion is incompletely evaluated. If there
are no previous studies to confirm its stability, then further
characterization with an ultrasound is suggested.
.
MRI T-spine ([**2141-4-10**])
IMPRESSION: Burst fracture at T6 with greater than 50% loss of
height and involvement of the anterior, middle and posterior
columns as well as retropulsion and spinal canal compromise.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old female with PMH of Parkinson's, COPD, CHF,
h/o L5-S1 discectomy presents with progressive LE weakness and
bowel and bladder incontinence, found to have a nontraumatic T6
burst fracture with retropulsed fragment.  Now s/p T3-T9
arthrodesis but with paralysis of bilateral lower extremities.
.
#. T6 burst fracture - nontraumatic compression fracture now s/p
emergent T5-7 posterior decompression and T3-9 fusion on
[**2141-4-11**]. Patient is now paralyzed from the waist down,
although sensation in her legs remains intact.  She seems to not
have sensation of her abdomen and has developed some abrasions
there, likely from her scratching the area.  Uncertain what
precipitated the fracture, T6 vertebral body was sent to
pathology to evaluate for pathologic fracture and only showed
fragments of trabecular bone with focal remodelling and
fibrocartilage with degenerative changes.
