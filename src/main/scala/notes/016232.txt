History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo female with PMH significant for atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, and CRI. According to her son, her
health care proxy, she became acutely short of breath around 9pm
after dinner. She called her son who felt that she was wheezing
over the phone. During the course of the day she felt well with
SBP~90's. Her SBP increased to the 120's during this episode.
She was otherwise asymptomatic: no chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, LE edema, PND, or orthopnea. The patient was
brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED via ambulance and had received Nitro SL X 2
and ASA 325mg.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 100.6 BP 214/99 AR 76 RR 36 O2
sat 88% NRB. Cxray suggested pulmonary edema. She was then
placed on CPAP with no improvement in her oxygen saturations and
was then intubated in the ED. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, LVH,
and 1st degree AV block. The patient was started on a nitro gtt
for elevated blood pressures but became hypotensive and was
started on a Dopamine gtt. CVP between [**9-29**]. She was then
transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.

Patient was also given one dose of Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
Azithromycin, and Clindamycin for possible pneumonia given her
low grade fever and mildly elevated WBC. She was also given ASA
600mg and multiple Versed boluses.

Per the patient's son, she has otherwise been feeling well. He
states that she had heart failure symptoms 2-3 years ago and was
placed on Lasix for a brief period of time, which had to be
stopped given worsening renal function. In regards to her afib,
she normally has a HR~50's but when she is in afib her rate
increases to 70's. No recent fevers, chills, or sputum
production. She was found to be in atrial fibrillation over the
weekend and was started on Amiodarone 400 TID and converted into
sinus rhythm. Patient is currently being treated with Penicillin
for UTI.

Past Medical History:
1)Atrial fibrillation: Diagnosed 3 years ago, cardioverted,
placed on Amiodarone for 1 year and then d/c'ed; cardioverted in
[**7-24**] to NSR, restarted on Amio [**10-24**] when she was found to be in
afib.
2)Hypertension
3)Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline Cr 2.1-2.4
4)Glucose intolerance
5)Hypothyroidism
6)Urosepsis
7)Colon cancer s/p total colectomy 4-5 years ago

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**11-1**]): Probable asymmetric pulmonary edema, right
worse than left.

2)Cxray ([**11-1**]): No evidence of pneumothorax, interval
improvement in pulmonary edema.

3)ECHO ([**11-2**]): 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. 2.There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). The apex is not well seen and may be particularly
hypertrophied, consistent with a possible apical septal
hypertrophy. 3.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen. 4.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. 5.There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

4)Cxray ([**11-3**]):Continued improvement in the appearance of the
lungs with a small left-sided pleural effusion

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 yo female with a history significant for atrial
fibrillation with controlled rate, HTN, and who presents with an
episode of acute shortness of breath due to flash pulmonary
edema.

1) Flash pulmonary edema:
She was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection positive for
Strep at an outside hospital a week ago.  In the ED, she was
found to have leukocytosis and T 100.6.  It is possible that she
reverted into AFIB in the context of infection, and had
pulmonary edema as a result of myocardial stunning and irregular
rhythm.  She does not have rapid ventricular rate, as her
typical HR is 50-60, and in AFIB her HR is 70-80.  She has been
in and out of AFIB during her admission.
It is also possible that she had pulmonary edema in response to
hypertension, as her SBP was 215/115 in the ED on admission.
She had been eating salty foods earlier in the day, and it is
possible that a salt load contributed.  Regarding an ischemic
etiology, her cardiac enyzmes were negative x3.  TTE showed EF
75-80% on dopamine (she had developed septic physiology
immediately before TTE was performed), no wall motion
abnormalities, possible apical septal hypertrophy, no MR, AR,
TR.  She should follow up with an outpatient stress test to
assess for possible ischemic etiology of pulmonary edema.  She
was intubated for proper oxygenation/ventilation, and tolerated
extubation well after 36 hrs.

2) Sepsis:
All blood cultures, sputum cultures, urinalysis, urine cultures
were negative.  On the morning after admission, patient's SBP
was 75 and T101.  It was unclear whether the patient had
received Ceftriaxone before she arrived in the CCU, and she was
given Ceftriaxone and Vanco.  She was placed on Dopamine, but
dopamine was rapidly weaned down after several hours.  She
remained afebrile with SBP 150-170, and she was restarted on BP
meds.  Vancomycin was discontinued.  Ceftriaxone was switched to
Cefpodoxime, the last dose of which should be given on [**11-11**].

4) Prolonged QT:
For her recurrent UTIs which were diagnosed as an outpatient,
she had been on Bactrim for UTI prophylaxis, Penicillin VK f
