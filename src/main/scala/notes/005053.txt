History of Present Illness:
80 y/o with PMH sig for CAD s/p 1 vessel CABG, EF 15%, CHF s/p
ICD, recent admit for GIB [**9-7**] for GIB requiring 1 U PRBC.
During this admission, he an EGD/colonoscopy off of coumadin but
was restarted ASA/Plavix/coumadin on [**9-9**] following procedure.
The EGD showed at that time showed mild gastritis and the
colonoscopy showed 3 sessile nonbleeding polyps in ascending
colon s/p hot snare single piece polypectomies (path showed
adenoma)
.
Pt presented to the ED on [**9-15**] after two episodes of BRBPR: one
at approximatley 12:45 am, and another one after the patient
presented to the ED. Pt denied any
n/v/diarrhea/melena/hematemesis/ cp/sob/f/c/NS or abdominal
pain.
.
In ED, found to have initial HCT of 35.4; INR 1.7, Pt was
initially HD stable but then dropped his SBP to 70s-->repeat HCT
was 28. Pt was given a 250 cc NS bolus, along with 1 U PRBC, 1
mg Glucagon, Protonix 40 mg IV. NGT lavage was normal (+bilious
return).  The GI service was consulted
DDx at that time included polypectomy site bleed vs. SB bleed
vs. brisk UGIB?- most likely from polypectomy. Initially
hemodynamically stable, but became hypotensive to BP 70's at 4
am, Hct drop to 28. Improved w/ IVF bolus 500 cc to BP 130's,
then trended down again to BP 90's.  He was transferred to the

[**9-15**] colonoscopy
Findings:
 Contents: Clotted blood was seen in the rectum and sigmoid
colon. Stool was found in the rectum and sigmoid colon.
Impression: Blood in the rectum and sigmoid colon
Stool in the rectum and sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to distal sigmoid colon
Recommendations: Bleeding Scan, if positive angiogram by IR.
If Bleeding scan negative and unable to do IR, continue golytely
prep and will re-attempt colonoscopy.Transfusion support.

[**9-15**] Embolization
PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
IMPRESSION: Super selective superior mesenteric arteriogram
demonstrating extravasation of the contrast at the region of the
ascending colon, which was embolized with four microcoils. No
extravasation of the contrast noted at the end of the procedure

[**9-18**] colonoscopy
Findings:
 Excavated Lesions A single circular non-bleeding 8 mm ulcer was
found in the proximal ascending colon. 3 cc.Epinephrine 1/[**Numeric Identifier 961**]
hemostasis with success. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied for
hemostasis successfully. 3 1 cc.[**Country 11150**] ink injections were
applied for tattooing with success.
 Other The area of the ulcer was about 3 cm from the ileocecal
valve. The scope visualized this area for 20 minutes and there
was no bleeding. Clots of blood were seen throughout the colon
all areas were washed and there was no active bleeding
Impression: Ulcer in the proximal ascending colon
Clots of blood were seen throughout the colon all areas were
washed and there was no active bleeding
The area of the ulcer was about 3 cm from the ileocecal valve.
The scope visualized this area for 20 minutes and there was no
bleeding.
Recommendations: Patient should continue to be observed in ICU
with frequent HCTs. If rebleeds will discuss with surgeons
utility of repeat endoscopy versus surgery.
