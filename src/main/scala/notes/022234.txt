Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoglycemia - The patient had a work up during her prior
hospitalization including C-peptide. Given her insulin regimen
which was changed in consultation w/ [**Last Name (un) **], her long acting
glargine may be a contributing factor in addition to variation
in her PO intake. Infection is more likely to cause
hyperglycemia, however it may also cause metabolic derangements.
Liver failure is possible, however unlikely give the absence of
other signs of liver disease in this pt despite her EtOH
history.
    Her BS was closely monitored and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted while
as an inpatient. They recommended her current regimin and to be
coninued to be covered by a sliding scale as the paitent may
need more Lantus as her renal function improves and she eats a
more normal diet.
# MS changes - When the patient was admitted, she was confused.
This improved with the reduction of her blood glucose..
# Hypoxia - Likely due to CHF and COPD exacerbation as there was
no pneumonia evident on CXR. CHF supported by CXR, however
difficult to obtain history regarding other signs/symptoms c/w
CHF. She was maintained on ipratropium 2puffs q4h, albuterol
nebs prn. She was continues with gentle diuresis.
# CHF - She was placed on a 2g Na restriction, fluid
restriction. She had a small troponin leak and cardiology was
consulted who felt this this was demand ischemia.  Her
lisiniopril was stopped given her renal failure.  Her Lasix was
also stopped and may be restarted by her PCP at [**Name Initial (PRE) **] future date.
The patient needs weighed daily and for her PCP to be called if
her weight increases by 2 lbs.
# UTI - prev Cx fluoroquinolone/bactrim resistant, ceftriaxone
sensitive.  She will be continued on a course of  antiobiotics
for a toltal of 5 days. She should have a UA and culture sent in
7 days after discharge.
# ARF on CRF- acute on chronic, may be [**2-16**] UTI and acute CHF
exacerbation. Renal was consulted who felt that her ARF was due
in part to hypovolemia and decreased intake if free water. She
may need Epogen as an outpaitent as she has anemia of chronic
renal failure.  She will need transfused for HCT below 27.
