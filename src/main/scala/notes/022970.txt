Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2157-5-2**] Cardiac cath
[**2157-5-3**] Redo sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft x3,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1, 2 and 3.

History of Present Illness:
56 year old male ESRD s/p CABG [**5-/2155**] (3vd, 5-CABG with LIMA to
LAD double touchdown with endarterectomy from D1 to apex; SVG1
to OM1 and jump to OM2; and SVG2 to PDA) with a complicated post
CABG cardiac history who presents with chest pain to OSH. He
reports that he developed two episodes of chest pain prior to
admission that were relieved by SL NTG. First was while driving
to dialysis 4 days ago and relieved with SL nitro and second was
[**Year (4 digits) 2974**] morning at rest. He has not had chest pain since his
admission with PCI in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year. At outside hospital
a TTE was performed and revealed a markedly positive study for
symptoms at low work level associated with 2mm downsloping ST
depressions diffusely. The nuclear study demonstrated a large
severe reversible defect in the entire lateral wall compatible
with myocardial ischemia, in addition to global hypokinesis,
lateral akinesis, and a markedly decreased LVEF. He developed
chest pain on HD 3 (same day of above mentioned tests) and was
started on a heparin gtt and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
work-up, consideration for cardiac catheterization. Upon cardiac
catheterization he was found to have in stent restenosis of the
left main and is now being referred to cardiac surgery for redo
bypass surgery.

Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATH [**2157-5-2**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed three vessel native coronary
artery disease. The LMCA had 80% instent restenosis distally.
The LAD had 70%ostial disease, 100% occlusion after S1 and 100%
occlusion after distal touchdown of LIMA. The LCx was a large
caliber vessel  with large territory. There was 95% ostial in
stent restenosis, 60% mid lesion; there was 100% occlusion of
OM1. The SVG-OM1 is flush occluded and the jump segment from
OM1-Om2 is patent and fills retrograde. The RCA is 100%
proximally occluded. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
borderline normal blood pressure (after sublingual nitroglycerin
given at start of case for chest pain) of 99/65 mmHg. 3.
Arterial conduit angiography showed a widely patent LIMA-LAD. 4.
Saphenous vein graft angiography showed  SVG-RPDA widely patent.
SVG-OM1-OM2 is known flush occluded. 5. Successful placement of
40cc IABP in RCFA under fluoroscopic guidance.
.
Echo [**2157-5-3**]: Transgastric views deferred due to increased
resistance upon gentle advancement of the probe into the stomach
(history of lap band surgery). Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50
%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal
free wall contractility. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. There is an intraaortic balloon pump in good position
with the tip 2-3 cm distal to the takeoff of the left subclavian
artery. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results at time of surgery. POST-BYPASS: The patient is in sinus
rhythm. The patient is on no inotropes. Biventricular function
is unchanged. Mitral regurgitation is unchanged. The intraaortic
balloon pump remains in good position. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation. Valvular funciton is unchanged. No other
changes from prebypass examination.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 M with ESRD on Hemodialysis, HTN, insulin dependent diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**5-/2155**]
complicated by stent restenosis s/p DES, now with recurrent LMCA
and ostial LCX restenosis. Admitted on [**2157-5-1**] and underwent
CABG X3 (SVG to OM1, OM2 and PDA) on [**2157-5-4**] after completing
pre-operative work up- see operative note for details. Off
bypass on vasopressin for hemodynamic support. Admitted to the
ICU immediately post-operatively for hemodyanamic monitoring and
management. Weaned off pressors readily. Weaned from sedation
and awoke neurologically intact and was weaned from the
ventilator and extubated. He was started on ASA, statin therapy,
and betablocker. Amiodarone was added for post-operative atrial
fibrillation. Plavix was resumed. His dialysis therapy was
resumed post-operatively. Chest tubes and temporary epicardial
wires were removed per protocol. He was evaluated by physical
therapy for strength and conditioning and was cleared for
discharge to home on POD#6. Ace-I was not resumed due to
borderline blood pressure. All follow up instructions and
appointments were advised.
