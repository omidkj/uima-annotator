Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4760**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BIPAP


History of Present Illness:
73 y/o woman with Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmmonary
disease on home o2 and bipap, complicated by multiple admissions
for dyspnea and altered mental status, is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
from the emergency department where she was brought by EMS after
being found with altered mental status and low peripheral blood
oxygenation.
.
She was most recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 65265**] where her Bipap
titration was increased from 14/10 to 16/12. She was also
started on lisinopril and had her oxycodone discontinued during
that admission.
.
In the Emergency Department, they confirmed SaO2 of 80s on room
air, and she was placed on a non-rebreather. An ABG performed on
the non-rebreater was 7.25/95/195. The patient was confirmed
DNR/DNI but per her daughter she has done well on BiPap in the
past. Bipap was initiated in the ED. A LLL consolidation was
noted on chest Xray and she was given levofloxacin and
ceftriaxone.
.
Further history and review of systems is obtained from her
daughter, who was at the patients bedside. She reports the
patient feeling ill for the last several days, with increased
coughing, weakness, and confusion. Her daugher notes she was not
delusional (as she can be), but more delerious, not knowing what
a remote control was, or stating that she was in the water when
she was not. Her daughter also reports that she has been lying
in bed, fatigued, and has had difficulty getting up. At
baseline, she in fact lives alone with 3x/day help and can
ambulate and occasionally cook something. She has been unable to
do these things of late.
.
Due to increased cough, she was started on levofloxacin by her
pcp [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2132-3-1**].

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2132-3-3**]:
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2132-3-3**].
The patient is rotated, which slightly decrease the sensitivity
of this study.
The patient is after median sternotomy. The lowest sternal wire
is broken,
although no displacement is demonstrated. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. There is mild pulmonary edema that
appears to be not significantly changed compared to the prior
study. Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
There is no pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema. No significant change in the
appearance of the chest radiograph compared to the prior study.
.
TTE [**2132-3-5**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%). The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is mildly hypokinetic, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic valvular
abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

A bubble study was performed but the suboptimal technical
quality means that the presence or absence of a PFO/ASD could
not be determined.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2129-1-10**], the previously seen focal anterior
wall hypokinesis, mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
regurgitation cannot be clearly seen on the current study due to
technical limitations.
.
CXR [**2132-3-6**]:
REASON FOR EXAM: Respiratory distress, COPD.

Comparison is made with prior study [**3-4**].

Increased opacity in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac
area is new,
could be due to atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be totally
excluded. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Left transvenous
pacemaker leads terminate in standard position. Sternal wires
are aligned. Mild fluid overload is unchanged as is the
prominence of the hila bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 y/o woman w/Diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
coronary artery disease, admitted to the the ICU initially with
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Hypoxemia/COPD/Community
Acquired PNA/acute diastolic CHF: The patient has known COPD,
chronic respiratory failure, and OSA. The patient had
hypercarbic respiratory failure in ED initially with initial ABG
7.26/95/195. From previous adissions and ABGs it appears that pt
is a chronic retainer of CO2, with lowest recorded pCO2s in the
60s. Pt is on 3.5 L NC O2 at home and BIPAP at night. Suspect
BIPAP noncompliance at home. In addition, pt was noted to have a
PNA and acute diastolic CHF complicating her picture. She had
noted wheezing, triggered by either pulmonary edema or frank
reactive airways disease. On BIPAP she had some worsening
hypoxemia, so there was concern of possible extrpulmonary shunt
or worsening pulmonary HTN. TTE was performed with a bubble
study, but this was of poor quality due to body habitus (unable
to eval for PFO). Per cardiology, next step would be TEE, but no
one would likely wish to pursue fixing any shunt and question
usefulness of further data. However, her hypoxemia began to
resolve, so further workup was not pursued. The patient was
treated with BIPAP, diuresis with lasix/diuril, and
levofloxacin. Given standing nebs/inhalers; spiriva being held
while on atrovent nebs. She completed her 5 day course of
levofloxacin. She was started on steroids as well, but became
notably agitated.
