Admission Date:  [**2120-6-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2120-6-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2045-10-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIAC S.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Worsening dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old
female who presents with aortic stenosis.  Over the past year
she has been having worsening symptoms of dyspnea on
exertion.  She became short of breath after climbing one
flight of stairs or walking two blocks on a flat surface.
She also had some lightheadedness when she was walking, but
denied any syncope.  The last echocardiogram was in [**2120-1-9**], which showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal wall motion and ejection fraction of 60% and a
severely stenotic aortic valve with a mean gradient of 43
mmHg and a peak gradient of 65 mmHg.  The calcified valve
area was 0.6 cm squared.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History is notable for the following:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Arthritis.
3.  Urinary frequency.
4.  Status post hysterectomy.
5.  Status post cholecystectomy.
6.  Status post bladder suspension.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Premarin 0.625 mg PO q.d.
2.  Miconazole 12.5 mg P.o.q.d.
3.  Detrol 4 mg P.o.b.i.d.
4.  Calcium 600 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Multivitamin PO q.d.
6.  Tylenol arthritis p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  NAPROSYN GIVES HER HIVES AND LOPID GIVES HER
INCREASED LIVER FUNCTION TESTS.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the blood
pressure is 136/65; heart rate 72.  NECK:  Without carotid
bruit.  HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with a systolic
murmur.  LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.  EXTREMITIES:
Palpable peripheral pulses with no varicosities.  Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated moderate-to-severe aortic
stenosis with nonobstructive coronaries and normal pulmonary
artery pressures along with a preserved left ventricular
ejection fraction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service on [**2120-6-18**], following her cardiac
catheterization.  The following day she was taken to the
operating room, where she had an aortic valve replacement
with a tissue prosthetic valve.  She received a #21 CE valve.
The procedure was remarkable for a transfusion requirement of
5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh-frozen
plasma and two units of platelets.  Total cardiopulmonary
bypass time was 92 minutes.  Cross-clamp time was 70 minutes.
Postoperatively, the patient was taken intubated to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.  In the Cardiac Surgery
Intensive Care Unit she was extubated overnight, but required
a Neo-Synephrine drip to maintain her blood pressure.  She
was slowly weaned off this drip throughout the course of the
first postoperative day.  By the morning of the second day
she was stable enough to be transferred to the floor.
However, that evening, she became tachycardiac to a pulse
rate of approximately 120 to 130.  The EKG at that time
demonstrated a junctional tachycardia that was narrow complex
in nature and very regular.  She required significant doses
of intravenously Lopressor in order to control her rate.  She
ultimately required 25 units of Lopressor IV and she was also
transfused with one more unit of packed red blood cells.  She
remained stable overnight, but the following morning she had
a recurrence of her tachycardia.  In addition, she started to
have some bronchospasm that was secondary to the IV Lopressor
and she may have also had an element of congestive heart
failure.  She was given intravenous Lasix and treated with IV
Diltiazem.  She converted after 15 mg bolus and she was
started on a drip at 10 mg an hour.  After this time, she
remained stable.  All of beta blockers were discontinued.
The following day, she started to be loaded with oral
Diltiazem.  By the 5th postoperative day, the oral Diltiazem
dosage increased and her drip was decreased.  In addition, it
became apparent at this time that she was going to need rehab
following her surgery.  She was started on subcutaneous
heparin and screening for rehabilitation was initiated.
During this time, she continued to be diuresed.  She was
essentially without complaint.  She did require some
intravenous doses of Diltiazem for heart rates between 100
and 110 as her drip was being weaned and her oral doses were
taking effect.

On [**2120-6-24**], the hospitalization was dictated in
anticipation of her transfer to rehabilitation.  We are
anticipating that she is transferred to rehabilitation on
[**6-25**], off her Diltiazem drip, taking 90 mg PO q.i.d.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Diltiazem anticipated to be 90 mg PO q.i.d.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o.b.i.d.
3.  Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d.
4.  Lasix 20 mg b.i.d. times seven days.
5.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. times seven days.
6.  Premarin 0.625 mg PO q.d.
7.  Percocet 5/325 one to two PO q.4h. to 6h.p.r.n.
8.  Tylenol 650 mg PO q.4h. to 6h.p.r.n.
9.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
10. Oxazepam 10 mg PO q.h.s.p.r.n.
11. Milk of Magnesia 30 cc PO q.6h.p.r.n.

On the afternoon of this dictation, a diabetes mellitus
consultation was obtained as the patient has had some
elevated blood sugars during this hospitalization and it
could be that she has undiagnosed diabetes mellitus at which
time she will likely be placed on an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

The patient is to followup with her family physician,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (un) **] in approximately two weeks.  In addition, she
is to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in approximately
four weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Aortic stenosis now status post tissue
aortic valve replacement.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypertension, controlled.
2.  Previously undiagnosed adult onset diabetes mellitus.
3.  Junctional tachycardia, controlled.
