History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old man with CAD (on plavix), afib (on
coumadin), CHF, DM, presenting with fatigue, black stools, and
anemia. He began to feel fatigued and have increased DOE about 1
week ago. He first noticed darker stools about 10 days ago. He
denies diarrhea, and was actually constipated. He denies
abdominal pain. He has mild nausea, but no vomiting. He also
denies CP, cough, fevers. His weight has been stable and he has
no LE edema. He recently had cataract surgery. He called his
PCP's office today with complaint of feeling very weak and
having more SOB. Labs were ordered from a local lab, which
showed: HCT 20.6, HGB 7.0, CREAT 1.4, INR 1.5, BUN 39, K 3.5, NA
136. Hct was 29.4 on [**2131-3-7**], high 30s-low 40s prior to that.
The patient was called with this hct result and instructed to go
to the ED. He went to the local ED at [**Hospital1 1774**] North where he was
found to have a benign abdominal exam. Stool was reportedly dark
brown and guaiac neg. Hct 20.5 was confirmed, with INR 1.5. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, VS: 97.7, 73, 122/88, 18, 100% on 2L nc. NGL was
negative. Rectal exam showed melena, guaiac +. He was given
protonix IV and ativan. 2U prbc were ordered but had not yet
come from the blood bank. He was transferred to the MICU for
further care.
.
In the MICU he received two units pRBC. He was seen by GI, and
had an EGD in the MICU, which showed only mild gastritis. His
HCT stabilized. His ASA and plavix and warfarin were held. He
was stable for transfer to medical floor.

[**2131-3-16**] EGD:
Impression: Mild gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Follow HCT and transfuse prn
[**Hospital1 **] PPI
Check H. pylori and treat if positive
Colonoscopy Monday if the patient remians in the hospital.
Otherwise can schedule as outpt.
Additional notes: Suspect UGI bleed from now healed/resolved
gastric lesions. Given magnitude of HCT drop and history of
polyps, would pursue colonoscopy as noted above.
The procedure was done by the attending and GI Fellow.

.
[**2131-3-19**]: colonoscopy:
Impression: Diverticulosis of the whole colon
Blood in the whole colon
Polyp at 35cm in the colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to terminal ileum
Recommendations: Continue to follow HCT and transfuse prn.
If the patient shows signs of recurrent bleeding would order
bleeding scan and angiography.
Additional notes: The most likely source of bleeding in this
patient is diverticular, though no actively bleeding
diverticulum could be identified. He has likely bled and
stopped. There was no blood in the TI to suggest an small bowel
bleed.
The procedure was done by the Attending and the GI Fellow. It
was discussed with the patient that, on rare occasions, a small
polyp or colorectal cancer can be missed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 84M with CAD, afib, CHF, DM, presented with anemia
and GI bleed, likely due to diverticulosis visualized on
colonoscopy.  While stabilizing pt home lasix was held, and he
went on to have a CHF exacerbation with dyspnea requiring
diuresis.
.
# GI bleed/blood loss anemia: Presented with symptomatic anemia
with hct ~21.  EGD showed gastritis, went on to have colonoscopy
showing diverticulosis but no visualized bleed.  Pt required
total of 4 units PRBC, and hct stabilized.  Spoke with pt's
cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**], and decision made to discontinue
plavix and continue aspirin and coumadin.
.
# CAD: Extensive CAD history with CABG x2. Initially held
aspirin, plavix, and coumadin,  and after hct stabilized
restarted on aspirin and coumadin but discontinued plavix per
recommendations of pt's cardiologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**].
.
# Acute on Chronic systolic CHF: Initially held BB, ACE, and
Lasix while stabilizing pt.  Once BP stabilized BB and ACE were
restarted.  Before home Lasix was restarted pt noted to have
worsening orthopnea and DOE.  Weight was 10lbs over baseine
weight (dry weight 138lbs).  Pt was diuresed with Lasix and
Metolazone, and returned to dry weight of 138lbs at time of
duscharge with improvement in DOE and orthopnea.
.
#. ICD/Pacemaker: 3 days prior to discharge pt reported that he
thought that he heard his ICD "beap."  EP service interogated
the PM, and there were no events.  On the day PTA pt had a 35
beat run of NSVT, and comlpained on mild dizziness that
resolved.  ICD did not discharge.  EP service was [**Name (NI) 653**], and
the recommended short interval outpt follow-up.  Pt was
scheduled for follow-up.
.
# afib: initially held coumadin given GI bleed. Once hct
stabilized he was restarted, and dose was increased to 5 mg
daily to achieve therapeutic INR.  Pt was instructed to follow
up at [**Hospital3 **] for INR check, and coumadin clinic nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 6787**] was informed that pt was being discharged and would need
to restart outpt INR checks.
.
# DM/glucose control: Continued NPH, and on discharge requiring
increased dose of 32 units QAM and 20 untis QHS.
.
# mild CRI: Creatinine remained at baseline.
.
# s/p cataract surgery: Continue eye drops per home regimen.
