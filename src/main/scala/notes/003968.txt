Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Myocardial infarction/Unstable angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2201-4-2**] - CABGx4 (Left internal mammary artery->Left anterior
descending artery, saphenous vein graft(SVG)->obtuse marginal
artery, Saphenous vein 'Y' graft to distal circumflex artery and
posterior descending artery.)

History of Present Illness:
This 48-year-old patient with exertional chest pain was
investigated and an angiogram showed very tight lesion in the
circumflex and severe triple-
vessel disease with 100% blockage of the right coronary artery
and critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. He
had persistent chest pain and hence was transferred urgently for
emergency coronary artery bypass
grafting. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram showed
the ejection fraction to be about 45%.


Past Medical History:
Hyperlipidemia
Myocardial infarction

Social History:
Works in a restaurant in food prep. Current heavy smoker. Mild
alcohol use.

Family History:
Brother with CABG at 53. Father with MI at age 75

Physical Exam:
GEN: WDWN in NAD
SKIN: Warm, dry, no clubbing or cyanosis. HEENT: PERRL,
Anicteric sclera, OP Benign
NECK: Supple, no JVD, FROM.
LUNGS: distant breath sounds anteriorly
HEART: RRR, No M/R/G
ABD: Soft, ND/NT/NABS
EXT:warm, well perfused, no bruits, no varicosities
NEURO: No focal deficits.

Pertinent Results:
[**2201-4-2**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-50 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to
moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
There was an episode of inferior wall akinesis with 3+ MR,
occasional PVC's and elevation of the PA pressures. After
treatment with phenylephrine and nitroglycerine there was
resolution of the RWMA and improvement of the MR.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A-pacing. Preserved
biventricular systolic function post-cpb. MR is now 1+. The
aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80822**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2201-4-2**] via transfer
from [**Hospital6 **] for urgent coronary artery bypass
grafting. He was taken from the intensive care unit to the
operating room where he underwent four vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He later awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a stain were started. On
postoperative day one, he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. Mr. [**Known lastname 80822**] was gently diuresed towards
his preoperative weight, the physical therapy service was
consulted for assistance with his postoperatve strength and
mobility. His chest tubes and wires were removed.  On the
evening of post operative day two he was found to have increased
work of breathing with desaturation so he was returned to the
indensive care unit.  Multiple sputum and blood cultures were
sent to the laboratory in response to a very wet chest
radiograph with questionable infiltrates. He was placed on
Vancomycin and zosyn originally for the same findings, and then
switched to levofloxacin as cultures began to return negative.
He was treated aggressively with bronchodilators and his
respiratory status improved markedly. By post-operative day five
he was no longer symptomatic and his chest radiograph had
cleared.  The patient continued to progress and was discharged
home with VNA services on POD6 in good condition.
