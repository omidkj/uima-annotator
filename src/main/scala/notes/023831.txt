HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5110**] is a 69 year-old
gentleman with a complicated past medical history who was
transferred from an outside hospital for persistent
respiratory failure and pulmonary edema.  In addition he had
staph aureus bacteremia and possible aortic valve endocarditis.
During his hospitalization he underwent cardiac catheterization
twice with stent placement in multiple coronary arteries and was
aggressively diuresed. A transesopageal echocardiogram
demonstrated no evidence of endocarditis.  He was
continued on IV antibiotics for bacteremia of unclear
source.  However, his pulmonary edema failed to resolve and on
[**2-13**] his family decided that they would like to make the
patient DNR to withdraw all supportive care except for comfort
measures. On [**2-13**] the ventilator was changed to CPAP and
the patient was administered morphine sulfate intravenously and
he passed away around 3:00 p.m. on [**2128-2-13**] from
respiratory failure.  Consent for an autopsy was obtained.
