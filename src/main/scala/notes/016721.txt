CXRAY [**2179-9-11**]
Stable cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement. Small
bilateral pleural effusions without evidence for pulmonary
vascular congestion.
.
CXRAY [**2179-9-12**]
Mild interstitial edema has progressed. Moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly with particular left atrial enlargement is
longstanding. Small right pleural effusion unchanged.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2179-9-13**]
EF 45%
-right atrium is moderately dilated
-The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm)
-There is mild symmetric LVH
-mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position.
-The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
-The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Torn mitral
chordae are present. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-8-11**], the
findings are similar (the difference in aortic valve area is due
to the use of an LVOT diameter of 2.0cm in the current study -
vs. the unusually high valve of 2.3 cm in the prior study).


Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB/Hypoxemia: symptoms improved with treatment for pulm
edema/CHF and obstructive airway disease likely cardiac ashtma.
Patient does not have documented history of COPD or asthma, but
was using nebulizer treatments at home. No PFTs available for
analysis. Resp exam consistent with volume overload given bilat
diffuse crackles on exam; however, patient is not grossly
congested on CXR. She was aggressively diuresed and her lasix
dose was increased. Continued nebs. No indications for steroids
as not COPD exacerbation. She was ruled out for MI with cardiac
enzymes.
.
# Cardiac: h/o systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Refer to
repeat ECHO report under investigations. continued Coreg,
Enalapril.
.
Afib - anticoagulated and rate controlled. Continued on Digoxin.
Changed warfarin dose to 2mg QHS.
.
# Swallow evaluation: patient was aspirating. Swallow evaluation
recommended
-diet of soft solids and nectar thick liquids. No thin liquids
PO. Alternate between bites and sips.
-Pills whole or crushed in applesauce.
-ENT consult to evaluate vocal fold closure to see if impaired
adduction might be causing the aspiration with thin liquids.
This could be done as outpatient.
.
# Hypothyroid: continue Synthroid
