Chief Complaint:
Hypertension during dialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right and left heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
33 yo M with ESRD on HD, DM1, nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
30-35%), hypertension, who developed hypertension after right-
and left- catheterization.
.
Patient had HD yesterday with removal of 3kg of fluids. He
denied any abnormal symptoms after dialysis. He took all of his
medications today except for Amlodipine. Today, he came in for
an elective catheterization to work up his cardiomyopathy as
part of the transplant workup for kidney/pancreas transplant.
The cardiomyopathy was first noted in [**11-17**] when he was admitted
for DKA. His [**Date Range 461**] then showed a depressed LVEF of
30-35%, down from 52% from previous [**Date Range 461**] in [**3-17**].
.
Thoday, he underwent a right- and left-sided cath which showed
elevated left and right sided pressures as well as wedge
pressure. Patient developed hypertension with sBP >190s in the
recovery area and was treated with IV labtalol as well as nitro
gtt.
.
He is being admitted to the CCU for dialysis while on nitro gtt.
Dialysis fellow aware.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black

Brief Hospital Course:
33 yo M with ESRD on HD, DM1, nonischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
30-35%), hypertension, who developed hypertension after right-
and left- catheterization.
.
# Hypertension/volume overload: Patient is an ESRD patient who
had received HD the day prior to admission to CCU. On the day of
admission Patient was noted to have sBP >170s during cardiac
catheterization, most likely from volume overload. Patient also
did not take his morning Amlodipine dose. He was admitted to the
CCU where he was started on ultra-filtration with the removal of
2.5L of fluid. Hypertension treated with nitro drip which was
weaned off prior to discharge.
.
# Cardiomyopathy: Patient was noted to have a decreased LVEF on
echo of 30-35% in [**2145-11-8**] during an admission for DKA,
down from baseline of 52%. He underwent elective right- and left
sided cardiac catheterization to workup his cardiomyopathy,
which did not show CAD but did show elevated pulmonary wedge
pressure of 42 and pulmonary pressure of 77/36, suggestive of
volume overload. Final catheterization report was pending at the
time of discharge. Please see OMR.
