head CT which showed no acute intracranial process. Chest X-ray
showed a confluent opacity at the left base, increased vascular
congestion c/w mild pulm edema and a streaky opacity in lingula
which may represent volume loss vs consolidation. She received

Imaging:
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2171-4-28**]:
1. Probable colocutaneous fistula between the sigmoid colon the
the gluteal cleft with an interposed 4-cm fluid collection. This
finding was discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7867**] by
phone at 8:09 p.m. on [**2171-4-28**].
2. Large area of left anterior body wall subcutaneous edema.
Clinical
correlation is recommended. This finding was discussed with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7867**] by phone at 8:09 p.m. on [**2171-4-28**].
3. Interval resolution of pubic symphseal air with persistent
irregularity of the cortical margins of the pubic symphysis.
This finding was discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in person by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7867**] at 6:09 p.m. on [**2171-4-28**].

floor
dysfunction but is difficult to determine on this study.

CT Head [**2171-4-28**]:
No acute intracranial process

CXR [**4-28**]:
1. Highly limited exam by body habitus and underpenetration.
2. Severe cardiomegaly. No definite pulmonary pathology

TTE [**2171-4-29**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Diastolic function could not be assessed.
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilate
