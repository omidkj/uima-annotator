History of Present Illness:
80yo M with h/o hyperlipidemia, RA, new diagnosis of
glioblastoma multiforme (grade 4) p/w altered mental status and
respiratory distress.  He was diagnosed in [**Month (only) 1096**] with GBM (by
biopsy) in the setting of increasing confusion, memory loss.  He
was started in [**Month (only) 1096**] on high dose radiation therapy at which
time he was also started on high dose decadron w/ q3day taper
(most recently on 3mg); last radiation session was late
[**Month (only) 1096**].  He also recently had a port placed through which he
was receiving avastin (last 2 weeks ago).  His family reports
mildly productive cough (cold sx) beginning approximately 1 week
ago; he had a CXR 3-4 days ago which reportedly was negative for
pneumonia and took atovaquone.
.
After the onset of these pulmonary symptoms, he later developed
left knee "bursitis" last week for which he received injection
most recently yesterday by PCP (presumably steroid injection).
He had largely been bed bound over the last few days [**1-4**] to left
knee pain.  Beginning this morning, he was very exhausted.  He
took a nap this morning and when he awoke, he was confused,
somnolent, lethargic.  His wife called EMS and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  En route to the ED, he was noted to be
in a.fib with RVR for which he received diltiazem.
.
In the ED initial vitals were T 96.7 HR 112 BP 105/67 RR 28  O2
sat 85% RA.  CXR showed multifocal PNA at RUL, RLL, LLL.  He was
placed on NRB and shortly thereafter O2 sats again dropped to
the 80s, thus he was intubated 4:30 pm.  Blood cultures were
drawn and he received levofloxacin 750g IV x1, vancomycin 1g IV
x1, ceftriaxone 1g IV x1, and azithromycin 500mg x1.  He also
received 10mg IV decadron.  He was initially normotensive, but
dropped pressure at 6:30 pm into 70s requiring initiation of
phenylephrine gtt.  Over his entire ED course, received total 5L
NS.
.
Head CT demonstrated "no new findings" and was reportedly
reviewed by [**Hospital1 18**] neurosurgery however there is no note in
chart/OMR.  Additionally he was seen by his neurologist who
follows him at [**Hospital1 2025**], however there is no documentation of this.

Brief Hospital Course:
Note: the majority of this hospital course refers to the
patient's ICU course.  He was on the medical floor for 16 hours
prior to discharge and was stable during this time.
.
# Septic Shock:  Met criteria for septic shock.  On presentation
had clear pulmonary source of infection.  Initial sputums grew
out pneumococci.  Patient relatively immunocompromised due both
to cancer diagnosis and chronic steroid use secondary to brain
tumor.
  On admission patient had central line placed, CVPs maintained
[**7-15**].  Patient needed pressors to maintain BP initially.  On
levophed, but developed some tachyarrhythmnias (Afib with RVR)
so was switched to neo.  Initially covered with Zosyn, levoflox
and vanco.  Patient was continued on atovaquone for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 6187**].  Patient was also intubated on presentation, and
maintained on AC.  Patient had EKGs without signs of ischemia,
and  multiple sets of normal cardiac enzymes.  Pressors were
largely weaned by HD #3.  He did rarely require brief periods of
neosynepherine, due to too-rapid diuresis.
   The patient had a normal cortisol stim test.
   Historically, it was noted that the patient had a red left
knee a few days prior to admission.  This knee was tapped by
ortho and found to be floridly septic.  He was taken to the OR
and washed out by Ortho (please see seperate op note for full
accounting of this procedure).  This infection was found to be
MSSA, which also grew out of his blood and eventually out of his
R chest chemo-port, which was removed by surgery.  He was
maintained on a 6week course of Nafcillin for this staph
infection.  A TEE demonstrated no signs of endocarditis.
Infectious disease was consulted and assisted with his
antibiotic regimen.
   The patient completed a full 14d course of Levoflox for
pneumonia.  The patient also had a full course of Clinda for a
question of toxic shock syndrome or aspiration pneumonia.  His
Vanco was d/c'd after 5d due to only MSSA growing out.  On [**12-20**]
his pre-existing R chest chemo port was noted to be purulent and
was removed by surgery.  This grew out MSSA.  Once more, the
nafcillin was continued for 6week total course.
  A [**12-21**] culture grew out yeast and he was started on a course
of fluconisol as per ID.  He recieved a full Ophtho eval which
demonstrated no ocular involvment.
  Planned course of treatment is for nafcillin for total of 6
weeks to end [**1-30**], fluconazole for 2 weeks total to end [**1-9**], and
ceftriaxone to end [**1-10**].
.
# Afib c RvR:  New-onset afib in the face of sepsis,
hypotension, infection.  Patient initially controlled with
boluses of Diltiazem or Lopressor.  Often returned into Afib
during times of increased activity or stress.
