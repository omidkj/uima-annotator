OSH transfer for shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 76 year old man with CAD s/p CABG, severe sCHF EF
12%, s/p prolonged repeated hospitalizations recently admitted
to [**Hospital1 2025**] until [**6-15**] for pacer lead change c/b sepsis sent in from
home to OSH ED for increased lower extremity edema and wound
drainage, SOB, weakness and melena x 2-3 days. Family also noted
decreased UOP, 5cc last 24 hours and elevated blood sugars 200s.
At OSH ED, initial BP 77/46 and sats 99%3L. After receiving 2L
NS for BP 60s-80s, he desatted to 80s so was placed on a NRB. He
appeared to be sleepy and in worse respiratory distress so was
intubated for distress and airway protection with etomidate/succ
7.5 ETT for hemodynamic instability and respiratory distress. Bp
did not improve with IVF so he was started on dopamine and
propofol drips. CXR significant for L pleural effusion and could
not r/o infiltrate so he was given Zosyn 3.375g and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He was also given calcium gluconate, insulin and
D50 for hyperkalemia K 6.8.
.
In our ED, he was weaned off of propofol and dopamine but then
started on low dose 0.1 mcg levophed for borderline hypotension.
Labs significant for renal failure with Cr 3.0, hyperkalemia K
6.3, WBC 18K, ALT 190, AST 315, trop 0.04, CK 282, lactate 1.7.
ABG 7.4/35/167. CXR revealed L lung whiteout and R mainstem
intubation so ETT pulled back. RIJ was placed. He was given
additional calcium gluconate, insulin, D50 and kayexalate for
hyperK. Given ascites on exam of unclear etiology, he had CT
torso which revealed ascites, diverticulosis, left pleural
effusion, no apparent etiology of sepsis. He was given vanco for
additional coverage as well as versed and fentanyl. GI was also
called given melena on exam and he was given pantoprazole for
melena despite normal HCT.
.
VS prior to trasnfer 105/55 60 100% on AC FiO270% Vt500 PEEP 5
RR 14.
.
On the floor, he is intubated and sedated.

Pertinent Results:
==============
Radiology
==============
CXR [**7-1**]
IMPRESSION: 4.2 x 1.1 x 3.2 cm fluid collection over the area of
clinical
concern in the left chest wall. This is amenable to US-guided
aspiration
.
CT Head [**7-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Old right ACA infarct.
3. Small vessel ischemic disease, chronic.
.
CT Chest [**7-1**]
1. Large left pleural effusion with near complete collapse of
the left lower
lobe.
2. Large volume abdominal ascites and nodular-appearing omentum
- in the
absence of liver disease, these findings are concerning for
underlying
malignancy (peritoneal carcinomatosis versus omental caking).
3. Densely calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta,
coronary arteries,
celiac, SMA, and renal arteries.
4. Status post CABG, cholecystectomy, and right partial
colectomy.
5. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis or
perforation.
6. Status post left femoral neck fracture fixation.
7. Old right posterolateral rib fractures, fourth through
seventh.

Brief Hospital Course:
76yo M with CAD s/p CABG, severe sCHF EF 12%, recent prolonged
hospital course c/b pacer lead infection and explant transferred
from OSH ED with hypotension and likely cardiogenic shock.
Hypotension was felt to be due to cardiogenic shock as well as
hypovolemia from GI bleed. Cardiogenic shock was supported
cold/wet appearance on exam, pleural effusions, and increased
ascites in the setting of increased LE edema and know low EF.
Patient was initially treated with dobutamine for improved
cardiac output and lasix drip. Initially covered with broad
spectrum antibiotics with vanco, cefepime, and cipro for initial
concern for sepsis.

Respiratory failure was felt to be secondary to cardiogenic
shock and possible contribution of pneumonia. Acute on chronic
renal failure was thought to be due to cardiogenic shock as
well. In regards to his gastrointestinal bleed, NG lavage was
positive but stool was nonmelanotic yet guaiac positive.

On the night of admission, family gathtered at the bedside and
patient's son and HCP [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 174**] [**Name (NI) 1105**] decided to pursue comfort
measures only care. Patient was extubated at 1 am on hospital
day #2 and was pronounced dead at 1 pm the following day with
family at the bedside.
