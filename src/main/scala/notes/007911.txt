Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45556**]
Chief Complaint:
Right sided weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Craniotomy on [**2134-3-3**].

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 63 year-old gentleman with a history of [**Doctor Last Name **] stage
IV metastatic melanoma who initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2134-3-2**] with acute-onset right-sided weakness and expressive
dysphasia.

He was originally scheduled to undergo craniotomy and
stereotactic surgery on [**2134-3-8**] for known metastatic lesions to
the brain.  He was started on dacarbazine on [**2134-3-1**] and
presented on the following day with the acute onset of
right-sided weakness and dysphasia.  He was found to have
increased size of a left frontal lobe mass (1cm on [**2134-1-29**] to
3cm on [**2134-3-2**]) with vasogenic edema exerting a mass effect.  He
was taken to the OR for a craniotomy on [**2134-3-3**] and a
stereotactically-guided procedure was performed and the left
frontal mass was removed. The mass was noted to have associated
hemorrhage. Since surgery, he has been treated in the NSICU for
blood pressure management (nipride, then labetolol drip, now on
p.o. lopressor), blood transfusions, seizure ppx. and pain
control.  His course has been complicated by post-operative
fever and FTT in addition to significant pain.  He was
transferred to OMED to initiate palliative XRT and continued
pain control.

On transfer to medicine on [**2134-3-15**], the pt. offered no specific
complaints.  He stated that his back pain was currently
well-controlled.  He denied recent fever, chills, shortness of
breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
-[**Doctor Last Name **] stage IV metastatic melanoma
Oncologic Hx:  In mid [**2131**],  the pt. developed a dark line
running horizontally across his right great toenail. Over that
time, the area widened apparently, and an opening appeared close
to the cutical, which moved with the outward growth of the nail.
He noted that bloody fluid eventually leaked from this opening,
A medial and lateral biopsy of the nail bed was performed and
initial biopsy was read as potentially a lymphoma. However,
follow-up pathology report was read as an ungal melanoma. His R
great toe was amputated on [**2133-4-11**].  His melanoma returned on R
great toe stump and biopsy on [**2134-2-4**] showed dermal metastatic
melanoma.  A full body CT/PET was performed and showed
metastatic lesions to the vertebral bodies, spleen, liver, and
brain (L frontal lobe).

Social History:
The pt. is a retired mechanical designer.  He lives with his

Pertinent Results:
Radiologic Data:
-MRI of head, [**2134-3-3**]:
Study performed demonstrating left frontal metastatic lesion,
which has increased in size compared to [**2134-2-20**]. Vasogenic
edema has also increased. No new lesions are identified

-MRI of head, [**2134-3-4**]:
There are postoperative changes in the posterior left frontal
lobe with no increase in mass effect compared to the
preoperative study. There is linear enhancement along the
anterior aspect of the operative site and a small amount of
residual tumor cannot be excluded. There are areas of T1
hyperintensity and susceptibility effect in the operative site
which might be related to small amounts of blood breakdown
products following the surgery, although they are also identical
in signal intensity to the original melanoma

Brief Hospital Course:
For details of the hospitalization prior to [**2134-3-14**], please
refer to the HPI.

1. Metastatic melanoma:  Upon transfer to medicine, the goal of
care was palliation with XRT to bony metastases.  He underwent
five sessions of XRT.  His pain was controlled with morphine and
acetaminophen.  The phsyical therapy and speech therapy services
were consulted to work with the pt regarding his neurologic
residua.  He was maintained on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
He was also maintained on dexamethasone for cerebral edema.

2. HTN: The pt. had elevated blood pressure after surgery as
discussed in the HPI.  On transfer to medicine, he was placed on
metoprolol with adequate blood pressure control.

3. Anemia: Secondary to bone marrow involvement with melanoma as
diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy.  He was transfused a total of 2
units of PRBCs after transfer to medicine for Hct < 25.  His Hct
was stable and over 30 for the last 5 days of admission.

4. RLL pneumonia: The pt. developed low-grade fever seven days
prior to discharge.  A chest x-ray was performed that showed a
questionable right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was started on
empiric levofloxacin and metronidazole and subsequently
defervesced.  He was discharged with a prescription for a seven
day course of these antibiotics to complete a 14 day course.

5. BRBPR: The pt. was noted to have scant BRBPR on [**2134-3-17**].  His
hematocrit remained stable.  Rectal exam disclosed internal
hemorrhoids.  He was also maintained on a PPI and carafate for
GI prophylaxis while on dexamethasone.
