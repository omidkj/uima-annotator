CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a
46-year-old woman with known 3B coronary artery disease,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% and
brittle diabetes.  She was in her usual state of health on 2
PM of [**2164-10-6**], when she was found on the floor of her home
after she attempted transfer from her wheelchair to her
couch.  She did not have any loss of consciousness, no head
trauma.  She did complain of shortness of breath and chest
pain.  The chest pain was described as a heaviness and
radiated to her throat.  It was associated with shortness of
breath, as well as nausea and vomiting times one.  She was
brought to [**Hospital6 33**], where EKG was unchanged and
CKs were 127, MB 11, troponin T 0.13.  She continued to have
refractory chest pain to the point that she received 10 mg
total morphine sulfate.  She became somnolent.  She was given
Narcan to arouse her.  She was also noted to have sodium 113
at the outside hospital.  She was subsequently sent to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further management of her
heart failure and chest pain.  Upon arrival, she again was
somnolent.  She was given 2 mg Narcan with improvement in the
mental status.  Heparin drip was continued.  Nitroglycerin
drip was started for chest pain and hypertension.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post non ST elevation MI
on 11/[**2163**].
2.  Congestive heart failure, EF of 25% to 30%; 1+ MR.
3.  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for 36 years,
complicated by retinopathy, neuropathy, gastropathy.  The
last A1c was 13 on [**10-16**].
4.  Asthma, no PFTs, questionable history of intubation.
5.  Osteoporosis with history of multiple rib fractures lower
extremity since [**2163-11-17**], chronically casted.
6.  Chronic skin infection, including dermatitis
herpetiformis, as well as glutin sensitivity.
7.  Iron-deficiency anemia.
8.  Congestive hepatoplasty, diagnosed by MRI on [**10-16**].
9.  Chronic hyponatremia.
10. Glaucoma.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to AMOXICILLIN.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

patient lives at homeless services, has support of her
mother.  [**Name (NI) **] history of drug abuse.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
Vital signs:  97.6, pulse 70, blood pressure 134/93,
respirations 21, saturating at 96% on two liter nasal
cannula.  GENERAL:  This is a young, chronically
ill-appearing female, somnolent, no acute distress.  HEENT:
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils:  Surgical on right, poor
vision bilaterally.  Sclerae were anicteric.  Extraocular
muscles are intact.  Oropharynx:  Moist mucosal membranes.
No lesions, no thrush.  NECK:  No carotid bruits, supple.
CHEST:  Decreased breath sounds bilaterally over the lung
bases.  Crackles 50% of the lung fields.  HEART:  Regular
rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur left lower
sternal border.  No radiations, no rubs, or gallops
appreciated.  ABDOMEN:  Distended, no fluid wave, positive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  3+ edema up to
the thighs.  Right lower extremity has multiple excoriations.
No evidence of cellulitis.  Left lower extremity in cast.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient was alert, oriented, somnolent,
and at times moves all four extremities.  CHEST:  X-ray on
admission demonstrated diffuse interstitial markings, curly B
lines, bilateral pleural effusions.  HEART:  Heart size,
upper limits of normal, moderate pulmonary edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the coronary
care unit for further management of her chest pain, shortness
of breath.  Cardiac enzymes at that time demonstrated CK of
114, MB 10, index 8.8, troponin I of 0.8.  It was unclear
whether the enzymes represented a mild ischemic event versus
a congestive heart failure exacerbation with troponin leak.
The enzymes rapidly normalized on the 23rd.  Diuresis was
initiated in the unit with good response.  The patient was
quickly stabilized and transferred to the floor for further
management of her congestive heart failure.  Echocardiogram
was performed on [**10-8**], when demonstrated extensive regional
left ventricular systolic function, consistent with
multivessel coronary artery disease, or other diffuse
process, possible mural apical thrombus, mild mitral
regurgitation, compared with prior study on [**2163-11-14**],
overall systolic function is more depressed, mild mural
thrombus is now suggested.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was restarted on
oral anticoagulation with Coumadin at this time.  The
Coumadin had previously been held in anticipation of eye
surgery.

She underwent diuresis on the floor averaging approximately
2  liters to 3 liters negative per day during the first week
of admission.  She was maintained on Natrecor, IV Lasix 120
mg along with Zaroxolyn 5 mg t.i.d.  During the
hospitalization the weight changed from admission weight of
69 kilograms to weight on the day of discharge of 45.9
kilograms representing greater than 50 pound diuresis.
Height if 5 foot 1 inch.

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] initially had an increase in the creatinine,
when she arrived to the floor from baseline creatinine of
approximately 1.0 to 1.7 on [**10-11**].  After the initiation of
Natrecor the creatinine again returned to [**Location 213**] and
stabilized.  Most recent creatinine was 1.2.

Medical regimen was optimized with the use of afterload
reductors, hydralazine, during aggressive diuresis and now
currently maintained on ACE inhibitor.

ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on telemetry
during the hospitalization stay with no arrhythmias, no
adverse events.  She was well beta blocked in the 60s.

RENAL:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has a chronic hyponatremia, etiology
uncertain.  During the hospitalization she was admitted with
a sodium of 114, which then improved to the low 120s with
initial diuresis.  However, with continued diuresis, the
sodium again fell to the 114 range.  She underwent repletion
with hypertonic saline.  The Renal Department was consulted
and recommended discontinuing her SSRI medication at it may
be the culprit in combination with her congestive heart
failure and possible hypovolemia for low sodium.  The Prozac
dose was decreased to 40 mg q.d.  She will continue to need
to taper this medication and outpatient psychiatry is being
arranged.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] complain of chronic IBS and
gastroparesis.  She was visited by her primary
gastroenterologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] while in the house, who
recommended starting Velnorm.  This was delayed until
outpatient as the medication is newly developed and
unavailable through our pharmacy.  We recommended future
followup for gastroparesis with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**].

ORTHOPEDIC:  The Orthopedic Department was consulted to
evaluate the patient's left lower extremity.  Repeat films
were taken and a new cast was placed.  The patient is
regularly followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the Department of
Orthopedics.  He will continue to follow her with the next
appointment in early [**Month (only) 1096**].  Fractures were felt to be
healing well.  She was able to ambulate with the Department
of Physical Therapy despite her cast.

ENDOCRINE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] has extremely brittle diabetes
mellitus.  Endocrinologists from the [**Last Name (un) **] Center were
consulted and visited her daily to optimize the insulin
regimen.  She is currently maintained on an atypical regimen
as NPH initially q.i.d., now currently b.i.d., as well as a
Humalog sliding scale insulin.  She will continue to need
close followup for management of her glucose values.
Dr.  [**First Name (STitle) 1661**] at the [**Last Name (un) **] Center has become familiar with
her case.  She often has critically high values alternating
with critical lows.  She was not symptomatic during any of
these eve
