HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79 year old female
with past medical history including chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, aortic insufficiency, mitral stenosis, and
hypertension who presented from an outside hospital with
pneumonia and congestive heart failure exacerbation.  In
outside hospital notes, notes record that the patient's
daughter reports that the patient had some shortness of
breath on the evening prior to admission.  It was worse on
the morning of admission and so EMS was called to transport
the patient to the hospital.  On their arrival, they found
the patient to be severe respiratory distress with oxygen
saturation of 80% in room air and unable to speak.  The
patient was given 80 mg of Lasix and easily intubated.  She
was extubated in the Emergency Department at the outside
hospital and initially did well on BiPAP.  However, while on
100% nonrebreather, the patient's oxygen saturation decreased
to 93% and she was tachypneic at 34 to 38.  Arterial blood
gases at that time revealed pH of 7.22, pCO2 of 55 and pO2 of
90.  The patient was intubated and transferred to the outside
hospital Coronary Care Unit.

In the Coronary Care Unit at the outside hospital, chest
x-ray was consistent with congestive heart failure with
extensive infiltrate in the right lung.  White blood cell
count was 24.0.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin for
presumed community acquired pneumonia.  During this time, the
patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction with
negative enzymes times three.  However, her electrocardiogram
showed symmetric deep T wave inversion.  When an attempt was
made to wean the patient off the ventilator, she developed
rapid atrial fibrillation with a rate of 150.  She received
Diltiazem and Lopressor with a decrease in her rate to the
80s.  She was subsequently started on Heparin drip and
cardioverted.  The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for further care.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, physical examination
revealed a temperature of 99.0, blood pressure 114/74, heart
rate 68.  The patient was intubated.  Vent settings were
assist control with a tidal volume 600, respiratory rate 10,
PEEP 5 and FIO2 of 0.4.  In general, the patient was sedated
on ventilator, nonresponsive.  Cardiovascular - regular rate
and rhythm, S1 and S2, III/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
base.  No carotid bruits, no appreciable jugular venous
distention.  Pulmonary - coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
The abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities revealed no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 139, potassium 3.8, chloride 108,
bicarbonate 25, blood urea nitrogen 28, creatinine 0.8,
glucose 121, calcium 8.5, magnesium 2.1, phosphorus 3.6.
White blood cell count 14.1, hematocrit 31.2, platelet count
368,000.  Prothrombin time 22.2, partial thromboplastin time
45.3, INR 3.3.

Chest x-ray on admission revealed a heart size the upper
limits of normal.  Upper zone redistribution with mild
diffuse vascular blurry consistent with congestive heart
failure, probable right effusion.  Increased retrocardiac
density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
consolidation.  Minimal atelectasis at the right base.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac - Coronaries - The patient ruled out for
myocardial infarction at outside hospital.  On admission,
electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm at 60 beats per
minute with deep T wave inversion throughout the precordium.
Very well, T waves were considered as possible explanation
given the patient's negative cardiac enzymes.  A CT of the
head was obtained on the evening of admission which was
normal.  Cardiac catheterization was subsequently performed
on [**2176-10-10**], to evaluate the size of the patient's coronary
arteries.  It revealed a right dominant system with mild
single vessel disease.  The left main coronary artery had no
angiographically appearing flow limiting stenosis.  The left
anterior descending had no angiographically appearance of
flow limiting stenosis.  The left circumflex had no
angiographically flow limiting stenosis.  The right coronary
artery had no significant disease, and the posterior
descending artery had a focal 70% tubular lesion in the
distal vessel.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right
sided filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of
5 mmHg.  There were elevated left sided filling pressures
with a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 12.  The
cardiac index was normal at three liters per minute per meter
square.  There was moderate pulmonary hypertension with a
pulmonary artery pressure of 36 mmHg.  Left ventriculography
revealed 1+ mitral regurgitation, no wall abnormalities, and
calculated ejection fraction of 55%.  Further evaluation of
the aortic valve revealed a peak gradient across the aortic
valve of 21 and a mean gradient of 16.  Calculated valve area
was 1.3 centimeter squared.  Evaluation of the mitral valve
revealed a mean gradient of 12.  Although the patient had no
critical coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization,
given her history of diabetes mellitus, she was started on a
statin during the admission.  A lipid panel from [**2176-10-11**],
revealed a triglyceride level of 114, HDL of 50 and LDL of
74.

Rhythm - The patient had a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation in the past and an episode of rapid atrial
fibrillation during extubation attempt at the outside
hospital.  She was electrically cardioverted at the outside
hospital and arrived to [**Hospital1 69**]
on an Amiodarone drip.  On her arrival, the patient was in
sinus rhythm.  She was continued on the Amiodarone 400 mg
p.o. twice a day.  This dose was continued for one week at
which time the patient's Amiodarone dose was decreased to 400
mg p.o. once daily for a total of one week.  At the end of
this period, the patient will be on a standing Amiodarone
dose of 200 mg p.o. once daily.  In addition, the patient was
anticoagulated for her atrial fibrillation while in the
hospital.  This was initially accomplished with a Heparin
drip as it was the plan for the patient to go for
catheterization.  Following catheterization, the patient was
restarted on Coumadin with a Heparin bridge until
therapeutic.  The patient remained in sinus rhythm throughout
the hospitalization.

Pump - The patient with a history of congestive heart
failure.  On admission, the patient did not appear volume
overloaded.  An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2176-10-8**], to
evaluate her pump status.  It revealed moderate dilation of
the left and right atrium.  There was mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater
than 55%.  Regional left ventricular wall motion was normal.
The aortic valve leaflets were moderately thickened with mild
1+ aortic regurgitation.  The mitral valve leaflets were
moderately thickened.  They show characteristic rheumatic
deformity with diffuse commissures and tethering of the
leaflet motion.  There was mild mitral annular calcification.
There was moderate mitral stenosis.  Mild to moderate 1 to 2+
mitral regurgitation was also seen.  Mild
