Service:  ICU

ADDENDUM:  This dictation is a summary of the hospital course
from [**2-16**] to the day of discharge.  Mr. [**Known lastname 13983**] had
been transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] intensive care unit to
undergo XRT for his lung cancer which was causing an SVC
syndrome.  He initiated treatment on [**2-17**] with a
mapping procedure and since then has completed his course on
[**2-27**].  Otherwise Mr. [**Known lastname 13983**] has continued to wean
slowly from his ventilator.  He underwent tracheostomy
placement prior to transfer.  He completed a 14-day course of
Zosyn for a presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia.  He
also remained on AmBisome for treatment of possible
aspergilloma.  Given our assessment that Mr. [**Known lastname 13983**] would
most likely take several weeks to be weaned from his
ventilator, efforts were made to prepare Mr. [**Known lastname 13983**] for
transfer to a chronic vent wean facility.  A percutaneous
gastrojejunostomy feeding tube was placed as well as a PICC
line for access and intravenous fluids if necessary.  A
family meeting was held with a Portuguese translator as well
as multiple members of Mr. [**Known lastname **] family to discuss his
prognosis as well as eventual disposition.  The family
appeared to express understanding that Mr. [**Known lastname 13983**] may only
have several weeks left to live due to the prognosis of his
lung cancer.  It was their decision that they wished to
proceed with placement to a rehabilitation facility in an
effort to wean Mr. [**Known lastname 13983**] off a ventilator.  He does remain
DNR at this time.

Otherwise over the last week the patient's fentanyl drip and
Versed drip have been weaned off.  He is now continuing
aggressive diuresis in an effort to mobilize fluid and if
diuresing well without any evidence of prerenal state or
intravascular volume depletion.  He is felt to be currently
stable to discharge to a chronic vent facility which is
believed to be [**Hospital6 13846**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to be discharged to the

for further management of his lung cancer.  At this time no
chemotherapy is planned and the patient should be evaluated
by the palliative care services at the [**Hospital6 **] facility.
