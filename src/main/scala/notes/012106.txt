Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3298**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
--Intubation/mechanical ventilation
--Tunneled catheter placement by IR

History of Present Illness:
This is a 44-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for DM 2,
hypertension, HCV, depression, and ESRD on peritoneal dialysis
(with history of peritonitis) who is admitted from the ED with
hypoxia in the setting of missing peritoneal dialysis for the
past 3 days.

Ms. [**Known lastname 93492**] states that she has had worsening, crampy abdominal
pain for the past 2 days, and as such, has not used peritoneal
dialysis since the night of [**12-1**].  She denies fevers, chills, or
dysuria.  Does endorse a recent cough that is productive of
mucous.  Of note, patient had similar abdominal symptoms in
[**10-30**] when she developed a coag negative staph infection in her
peritoneal cavity.  She was treated with a 14-day course of
intra-peritoneal vancomycin.  Patient was also instructed to
follow-up with her nephrologist and transplant surgeons in
anticipation of starting hemodialysis.
.
Patient states that she was having trouble breathing the night
prior to admission, and felt acutely dyspneic on the morning of
admission.  In the ED, initial vitals were: 130 164/89 and 53%
on RA.  An ABG was significant for: 7.43 pCO2 28 pO2 37.  White
count was 19.5 with a leftward shift and lactate was 4.4.  A CXR
was consistent with volume overload.  Ms. [**Known lastname 93492**] was given 120mg
of IV lasix (she put out 600cc of urine) and nitro.  She was
started on a BIPAP mask with improvement in her sats to 99% with
[**3-24**] and FIO2 of 100.  Renal was consulted and recommended
admission to ICU with initiation of hemodialysis.  On transfer,
vitals were: 115, 169/100, 99% on CPAP.

Past Medical History:
Diabetes mellitus type 2,
Hypertension,
Hepatitis C

================
OTHER STUDIES
===============
ECHO [**2107-12-8**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.

CXR [**2107-12-3**]:  A single AP radiograph was obtained. There is
diffuse airspace opacity within the lungs, radiating from the
hila, most consistent with severe pulmonary edema. The heart
size is difficult to assess. The mediastinal contours are
normal. No definite pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Diffuse pulmonary airspace opacity which may reflect
severe pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
ThiS is a 44-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for HTN,
DM2, HCV, and ESRD on peritoneal dialysis who presents with
acute shortness of breath, likely from volume overload.

Active issues:
# Acute diastolic heart failure:  On admission, pt presented
with exam findings and radiographic evidence of volume overload,
likely [**12-22**] missing PD.  In the ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 93492**] was started on
BIPAP and her respiratory status improved.  She was given 120mg
of IV lasix and put out about 700cc.  She was then transferred
to the MICU where she was given 120mg of IV lasix and 500mg of
chlorothiazide with little urine output.  Patient continued to
be short of breath, and an urgent HD line was placed.
Ultra-filtration was started that night.  However, respiratory
status continued to decline and on second hospital day, patient
was intubated and started on ARDS net protocol.  She continued
to receive UF and was ultimately extubated on [**2107-12-8**].  An ECHO
showed a normal EF.  On discharge, her lungs were clear to
auscultation and she had no peripheral edema.  She will
transition to outpatient HD after discharge.

# ESRD: Patient with ESRD likely from diabetes and hypertension.
 Nephrology service was consulted and felt that she was not a
good candidate to continue PD and felt she should be
transitioned to HD.  She had a tunneled LIJ placed for access
and AVF mapping prior to discharge.  She will continue to
follow-up with the outpatient nephrology team.  She is also
scheduled to follow up with the transplant surgery service for
removal of her PD catheter.

# Delirium/Encephalopathy: Pt had waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
following extubation and transfer to the floor, with occasional
agitation that responded well to low doses of IV haldol.  This
was thought most likely due to sedating medications used during
her intubation and MICU course.  Her AMS resolved by discharge
without intervention.

# Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive after HD with BP 80s/50s.  She
remained asx and her BP improved to low-normal without
intervention.  Her amlodipine was decreased to 5mg daily and her
clonidine patch was decreased to 0.1mg/24H to prevent post-HD
hypotension, and she should follow up with her PCP and HD
nephrologist regarding her antihypertensive regimen.

# Leukocytosis:  On admission pt had elevated WBC at 15.  This
was initially concerning for infection and she was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics in the MICU.  However she had no
focal s/sx of infection and culture data was negative.
Antibiotics were discontinued and her leukocytosis resolved.

# Abdominal pain:  Patient had abdominal pain on presentation
that prevented her from adhering to PD.  Her lipase was
elevated, but she had no radiographic signs of pancreatitis (on
CT without contrast).  Patient's abdominal pain eventually
resolved and she was able to eat without difficulty.

Chronic issues:
# HTN:  Her amlodipine and clonidine doses were decreased due to
post-HD hypotension as above.

# DM:  Patient was briefly hypoglycemic
