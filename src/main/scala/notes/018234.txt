Date of Birth:   [**2097-8-19**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
woman with a history of hypertension and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who was transferred from [**Hospital 28978**] Medical Center with a large right
intraparenchymal hemorrhage and bilateral subarachnoid blood
throughout the sulci, Hunt and [**Doctor Last Name 9381**] Grade V.  The patient was
sitting alone at a restaurant this evening when she became
unresponsive.  She was intubated at the scene and was brought to
an outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2. Arthritis.  3.
Question of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination she was intubated,
sedated and paralyzed.  Her blood pressure was 135/53, heart
rate 49, respiratory rate 23, saturating 100%.  The right
pupil was 5 and nonreactive; left was 3?????? and slightly
reactive.  Lungs had equal breath sounds but with some
rhonchi.  Respiratory rate was stable.  Cardiac was regular
rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  Abdomen was
nontender, positive bowel sounds, nondistended.  Extremities
had no edema, bilateral pulses.  She was intubated and
sedated.  She withdrew her left leg and left arm and right
foot to painful stimuli.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the intensive care unit
for close neurologic observation after transfer from an
outside hospital.  She had a left ventricular drain placed on
admission.  On [**2160-8-23**] the patient remained intubated and
sedated.  Pupils were 3 down to 2 mm bilaterally.  She had
coiling done for a ruptured middle cerebral and anterio
communicating artery aneurysms on [**2160-8-23**], and then was taken to
the operating room for craniectomy.  Her postoperative course
was complicated by pulmonary edema and adult respiratory
distress syndrome, as well as the need for ventricular drain
placement.  The patient grew out gram-negative rods in her
blood and was on Cipro and ceftazidime for treating blood
sepsis.  She also had Klebsiella in her sputum and an episode
of elevated liver function tests.  She had a right upper
quadrant ultrasound.  The patient was on Levophed and
Neo-Synephrine to keep her blood pressure up.  She had
episodes of pulmonary edema requiring Lasix.  She had a Swan
placed on [**2160-8-15**].  On [**2160-8-16**] she had bursts of atrial
fibrillation and flutter with narrow-complex tachycardia.
She was started on Lopressor.  She was less arousable on
[**2160-8-17**] and had a head CT that showed increased swelling.
Her ICPs were 15-24 at that time and her drain was at 0.  She
had a CT on [**2160-8-19**] that showed worsening bleeding and also
again on [**2160-8-20**].  She was sedated and paralyzed.  She
continued to have problems with atrial fibrillation and
flutter and was on Lopressor.  On the 17th she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
bolt placed.  Her ICP was 17-20.  Her CT was unchanged.  On
[**2160-8-22**] she had an angiogram that showed no spasm and her CT
was unchanged.  On [**2160-8-23**] her saturations dropped along
with her oxygenation and her pressor requirements were
increasing.  On [**2160-8-26**] she was off sedation.  Her CT was
unchanged.  She had the vent drain placed on [**2160-8-28**] for
hydrocephalus.

Neurologically her craniotomy site was pulsatile.  Her pupils
were 4 down to 2 mm and symmetric.  There was no movement in
the extremities.  She had positive corneal reflexes
bilaterally.

On [**2160-8-28**] her pupils were equal and reactive to light.  She
did not withdraw to pain in her upper extremities.  She did
not grimace to pain.  She did not withdraw her lower
extremities.  She did have positive corneals.  The vent drain
was placed on [**2160-8-28**].

On [**2160-8-29**] the patient's neurological status was unchanged.
She was unresponsive except for left foot withdrawal to pain.
Pupils were 3 mm and were briskly reactive.  She had a weak
gag and weak cough reflex.  Her [**Last Name (un) **] bolt ICP levels were
[**5-14**].  Ventricular drain noted to be [**9-14**].  Her sites were
clean, dry and intact.  She continued on Levophed and
Neo-Synephrine drips to titrate to keep her pressure 150-180.

On [**2160-8-31**] neurologically she had slight withdrawal to deep
nail bed pressure on the left lower extremity, otherwise did
not respond to withdrawal, pain, or sternal rub.  She did
open her eyes at times but did not track.  She had positive
corneals.  Pupils were 4-5 mm and brisk.  Vent drain remained
in place and the [**Last Name (un) **] bolt, and were both intact with ICPs
[**5-15**].

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] met with the family on [**2160-9-1**] and the plan was to
continue current treatment.  On [**2160-9-1**] the amlodipine was
discontinued and the patient's triple H therapy was weaned
off.  The family wished to continue with the current care.
On [**2160-9-2**] her brain flap was soft.  Her eyes were open
spontaneously, her pupils were equal, round and reactive to
light.  She had no movement to painful stimulation and no
spontaneous movement.

On [**2160-9-4**] the patient had PEG and tracheostomy placement
without intraoperative complications.  Neurologically she
opened her eyes, looked around the room, did not follow
commands, grimaced to painful stimulation in the upper and
lower extremities with small movement of the left lower
extremity.

On [**2160-8-23**] she had Klebsiella in her blood and was continued
on vancomycin for IV antibiotics.

On [**2160-9-7**] the patient had swelling in the left upper
extremity.  Vascular surgery was consulted.  An ultrasound
revealed a thrombus in the left subclavian and axillary veins
with flow in the cephalic vein, no flow in the brachial.  The
patient therefore had a superior vena cava filter placed on
[**2160-9-7**].

Bone flap surgery actually was postponed due to positive
blood cultures.  The patient had gram-negative rods growing
in her blood.  Infectious disease was consulted.  The patient
was on Flagyl for anaerobes and being covered with
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for antibiotic coverage.
She had gram-positive cocci in her blood, thought to be a
contaminant and gram-negative rods in her blood also, but
that was not considered to be a contaminant.  Diagnosis was
VRE from a femoral stick on the 15th.  She was continued on
levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Vancomycin was changed to linezolid
600 mg p.o. b.i.d.

On [**2160-9-19**] the patient opened her eyes spontaneously and to
stimuli, roving eye movements, but following staff, not
following commands, no seizure activity, ventricular drain
was in place.

She had bone flap replaced on [**2160-9-24**] without intraoperative
complications.  Post procedure the patient was awake and
attentive, tracking movements with her eyes, not following
commands but moving her extremities to painful stimulation x
4.  Her drain was raised to 15 cm above the tragus.  Her
drain continued to be raised and was finally discontinued on
[**2160-9-30**], and the patient had a lumbar puncture the following
day with an ICP of 20.  She was transferred to the regular
floor on [**2160-10-1**].  She was awake, attentive, smiled
appropriately, was following commands centrally.  Pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  She moved the right
side spontaneously, more so than the left side but both sides
were moving.  She was afebrile and her vital signs were
stable.

On [**2160-10-8**] she went to the operating room for
ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.  There were no
intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively she is awake,
alert, attentive, following midline commands, moving the
right side more spontaneously than the left side.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Dilantin 200 mg nasogastric q. 12 hours.  Her Dilantin
level was high and her Dilantin was held for three days.  Her
last level on [**2160-10-9**] was 15 and her dose was decreased to
200 nasogastric q. 12 hours.
2. Cefazolin 1 gram IV for 48 hours to be discontinued on
[**2160-10-10**].
3.
