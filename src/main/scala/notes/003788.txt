Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Nonproductive cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy
Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
59yo F with recent prolonged hospitalization for left arterial
embolic clot s/p thrombectomy with course complicated by PCP
pneumonia, new diagnosis of HIV/AIDS as well as occipital stroke
presenting with worsening nonproductive cough and new oxygen
requirement.  Patient reports that she developed shortness of
breath and a nonproductive cough approximately 3 days ago.  She
denies associated fever or chills.  She reports lightheadedness
which is always present, not worse.  She denies chest pain. She
reports that the cough is different than her raspy, productive
cough she had during her recent admission.  She has been
coughing to the point of dry heaving.  Patient was seen for
these symptoms by the [**Hospital3 **] physician today who was
concerned given her new oxygen requirement of 3-4L from baseline
of room air in addition to hypotension.
.
Patient was hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 91031**], initially admitted
with a cool left foot, found to have an arterial embolic clot
requiring thrombectomy and fasciotomy.  Her hospital course was
complicated by hypotension and hypoxia requiring multiple
intubations, found to be due to PCP pneumonia for which she
completed a 21 day course of bactrim and steroids. She also had
a superimposed HCAP treated with vancomycin/zosyn for 8 days.
She was discharged on bactrim prophylaxis and a steroid taper
which was completed on [**2102-11-20**].  She was diagnosed with HIV
with a CD4 count of 11, and started on antiretrovirals prior to
discharge.  In addition, she was found to have an occipital
stroke, thought to be embolic in nature.  A TTE did not identify
a PFO.  She had persistent diarrhea, which, in the setting of
CMV viremia, was presumed to be CMV colitis, for which she was
treated with IV gancyclovir (currently day 13).
.
Patient reports that since discharge from the hospital on [**11-15**]
to [**Hospital3 **] she has felt fine until three days ago.  She
has had ongoing diarrhea approximately 3 times a day, not
improved with loperamide.  She reports that she is barely
eating, mostly due to "stubbornness".  She denies dysphagia or
odynophagia. She is drinking fluids frequently.
.
In the ED initial vitals were T 98.3 HR 80 BP 83/47 RR 18 O2Sat
97% 3L NC.  Patient reported no acute symptoms.  Patient was
given 2L of IVF and pressures increased to 97/50.  She received
a dose of vancomycin and zosyn as well as dexamethasone for PCP
treatment, however patient did not receive bactrim.  Labs were
notable for an INR of 11.46 and she was given 1U FFP.  Given
hypotension, ED was concerned for RP bleed so a CT abd/pelvis
was performed which showed no evidence of a bleed.
.
On arrival to the ICU vital signs were BP 92/5o P 92, RR 24,
O2Sat 96% on 2LNC.  When oxygen was turned off, patient desat'ed
to 91-92%.
