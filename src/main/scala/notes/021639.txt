History of Present Illness:
HPI: 56 F with no sig PMH presented to [**Hospital3 10310**] Hospital
in [**Location (un) 14663**] after 6 day illness described as fever, cough,
dyspnea, and poor appetite. In ED, fever to 104 HR 130s BP
121/33, RR 40 O2 88% RA. CXR at OSH suggestive of multilobar
PNA. Pt was given Ceftriaxone and Azithro in ED and admitted to
floor. Overnight, pt continued to be tachypnic RR 40s, difficult
oxygenating. Pt was tried on biPAP overnight. Despite this at 4
am, HR increased 150s, RR 60s. ABG: 7.27/? pCO2 /84 on 100%
biPAP. A decision was made to intubate patient. Post intubation
ABG 7.26/43/78 on FiO2 100% SIMV 600/14/1.0/5
In addition, overnight her WBC fell from 10--> 7 and patient
developed bandemia to 41%. Antibiotics broadened from
Ceftriaxone/ Azithro to Zosyn, Levo, Flagyl. No lactate in
outside hospital records. Blood pressure remained stable, but
due to difficulty with ventilation, a decision was made to
transfer patient to [**Hospital **] Hospital ICU for swan. However,
patient noted to be hypoxic on leaving hospital. Her transfer
paralyzed with vecuronium and re-routed to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.
.
On arrival, pt appeared ashen, diaphoretic.
VS on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] were: T 102.7 HR 140s BP 150/60s RR 26 O2
94% on FiO2 100% on AC 450/26/15/60
.
Immediately on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], a RIJ line was placed under
ultrasound guidance with 1 stick and a Left a-line was placed
after many attempts.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56 yo female transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from [**Hospital3 10310**]
Hospital with severe bilateral pneumonia, now known to be
Legionella based on urinary Ag from OSH and respiratory culture
findings.
.
1. Respiratory failure: Pt was in ARDS on admission and
hypoxemic. Had been intubated at the OSH but was difficult to
ventilate and required paralytics to get her to breathe in sync
with the ventilator. She was paralyzed with cisatrucurium for
one day, then paralysis was lightened as the patient was able to
work with the vent. She was kept on ceftriaxone and azithromycin
for presumed community-acquired pneumonia until the urinary
legionella Ag from the OSH came back positive. Ceftriaxone was
then discontinued, and the patient completed a 14 day course of
azithromycin for Legionella pneumonia. For sedation, she was on
versed and fentanyl which both needed to be escalated to keep
her sedated. After a week, she was switched over to propofol for
better sedation and to prevent further escalation of
fentanyl/versed. She was volume overloaded throughout the course
of her ARDS due to acute renal failure requiring 3 days of
hemodialysis. Once the ARF resolved, she began to mobilize
fluids on her own and diurese. With diuresis, her oxygenation
began to improve and she was able to tolerate extended trials of
pressure support. She was given boluses of Lasix, then a lasix
gtt, to enhance her diuresis with the goal being extubation. She
was extubated on [**2147-6-28**] and did well for the first twelve
hours. However, at approximately 2am, her O2 sats began to drop
on 4L nc and she became tachypneic with a RR in the 50s. She was
placed on facemask, then a NRB to keep her sats in the 90s. A
CXR was taken at the time and looked like she was in CHF. Her
ABG at the time was 7.41/45/152 so she was kept on 100% FM and
given 40mg Lasix IV. Attempts were made at noninvasive
interventions with further diuresis and a trial of BiPAP but the
patient began to tire and she was reintubated to improve her
respiratory status. EKG and cardiac enzymes were negative,
excluding a cardiac cause for her decompensation. A CT scan was
negative for PE, but did show moderate sized bilateral pleural
effusions with compressive atelectasis. She also had thicker
sputum, a fever, and an elevated white count, concerning for
perhaps a VAP. Empiric antibiotic therapy was started (piptazo,
levaquin, and vanco). Once reintubated, her sedation was kept
light and the patient was able to maintain her oxygenation on
settings of AC 500x12, .4, and 10 of PEEP. She was very
sensitive to the PEEP, leading us to believe that the etiology
for her desaturation after extubation was decruitment of some
critical number of her alveloi, causing atelectasis and an
inability to maintain her oxygentation. She was given boluses of
Lasix to aid her diuresis, with the goal of being net negative
2L each day. The pt continued to have fevers and a urine culture
showed probable Enterococcus. Ciprofloxacin 500mg [**Hospital1 **] was
started. Sedation was decreased and the patient was extubated on
the [**7-7**]. The patient tolerated the extubation well and did not
have any further supplemental oxygen requirements. The patient
remained afebrile and the course of Ciprofloxacin
