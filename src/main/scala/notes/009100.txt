Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-left heart catheterization with balloon angioplasty to the
proximal and mid RPDA artery
-right heart catheterization to evaluate ASD


History of Present Illness:
83 yo M with hx of prior MI ([**2090**]), DMII, HTN, dyslipidemia,
GERD, depression, glaucoma presented to OSH with complaints of
chest pain since last night and BP elevated to 190/80 and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for STEMI.
.
Patient was in USOH, pain described as intermittent with
radiation to his left arm and jaw, associated with nausea but
denies palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, vomitting.
.
OSH COURSE: First EKG and cardiac enzymes at OSH was normal (415
am).  However he continued to complain of chest pain.  Second
set of enzymes showed elevated troponin to 0.15, CK-MB 22 and
repeat EKG showed ST elevation in inferior leads (12:15 pm).  He
was started on a nitroglycerin drip, heparin drip and received
IV morphine, aspirin, Lopressor 25mg PO, and plavix 75mg PO.  He
was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent catheterization.
.
In the Cath lab, he received heparin, fentanyl, ntg. Cardiac
surgery was consulted but touchdowns were unsuitable for CABG.
POBA to prox and mid RPDA.  Had LVEDP of 26, dx with severe LV
diastolic heart failure. Angioseal placed and sent on ntg drip
to CCU.
.
At baseline, he reports being able to walk [**1-3**] mile.  He is
limited by leg cramping, but denies any chest pain or shortness
of breath.  Endorses 1 pillow orthopnea, denies PND.
.
On review of systems, he endorses chest pain, leg cramping,
orthopnea.
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of chest pain
and orthopnea.  Notable for absence of dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Left Heart Catheterization ([**2108-6-26**]):
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  Cardiac surgery

consulted who did not fel anatomy suitable for CABG given
severity of
native vessels without adequate graft targets.
2.  Severe systemic hypertension.
3.  Severe left ventricular diastolic heart failure post-PCI.
4.  Successful balloon angioplasty of the proximal and mid RPDA.

5.  Successful RFA AngioSeal closure.
6.  Aspirin given at the conclusion of the case given vomiting
of
undetermined pill fragments.
7.  Consider clopidogrel re-load and 75 mg daily for at least 1
month
for secondary prevention post-MI and post-PCI, with assessment
of
benefits with respect to secondary prevention post-PCI versus
bleeding
risks. Dual anti-platelet therapy is not mandatory as stent was
not
deployed (due to small vessel size <2 mm reference vessel
diameter and
poor runoff).
8. Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5686**].
.
ECHO ([**2108-6-28**]): The left atrium is elongated. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. A secundum
type atrial septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears globally depressed
(ejection fraction 30-35 percent) with regional variation: the
posterior wall is akinetic, the inferior and lateral walls are
severely hypokinetic, and most of the other walls of the left
ventricle are mildly hypokinetic. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal
free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
Right Heart Catheterization ([**2108-6-28**]):
1. No significant left to right shunt.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Elevated filling pressures.
4. Preserved Cardiac Output.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo M with hx of prior MI ([**2090**]), DMII, HTN, dyslipidemia, who
presented to OSH with complaints of chest pain and elevated [**Hospital 89243**]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for an inferior STEMI. Pt was not a CABG
candidate so he is s/p POBA and medical management of his STEMI.
