Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
63 year-old male with follicular lymphoma who was recently
discharged one week ago after being treated for L3 thecal sac
compression who now presents with generalized weakness for one
day prior to admission.  He had been well at rehab until he
began to feel a generalized fatigue and weakness.  Initially,
this resolved on its own, but then returned the following day.
At the time, he denied any fever, chills, lightheadedness, chest
pain, cough, shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting.  He was
then transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**].  However, during transport, he
became hypontensive to the 80's systolic, tachycardic to the
140's, and hypoxemic to the 70's.  He was diverted to [**Hospital1 3793**] and was found to have pneumonia on chest x-ray.  He was
given one dose of ceftriaxone and received 2L of normal saline
with improvement in vital signs.  He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
In the Emergency Department, he was normotensive, afebrile, and
his oxygen saturations were in the mid-90's on 4L nasal cannula.
 He also had an elevated lactate.  He was given vancomycin and
azithromycin.  He was transfered to the Intensive care unit for
further care given that he appeared septic since he was
initially hypotensive with an elevated lactate.


Past Medical History:
Past oncology history: He was diagnosed with low-grade
follicular lymphoma in [**2168**] when he presented with a large right
neck mass. He was treated with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy
followed by 4 cycles of Rituxan. He had a good initial resonse
to chemotherapy; however, his disease recurred in [**2172**].  He
underwent 2 more cycles of CHOP followed by CEPP. He was
subsequently treated with Bexxar radiolabeled antibody and
attained a complete remission for about 3 years.  In [**Month (only) 956**]
[**2176**], he noted the gradual increase of his right neck mass,
which showed follicular lymphoma on biopsy.  He underwent [**3-5**]
cycles of R-CEPP responded well.  This chemotherapy was
itnerupted secondart to a hip fracture.  He was notd to have
cervical spine involvement of imaging and was place in a soft
cervical collar.  He underwent 2 cycles of [**Hospital1 **] salvage
chemotherapy in [**7-4**] and [**8-4**].  He recently was admitted thecal
sac compression at the L3 level for which he received 10 doses
of radiation therapy.

Past Medical History:
1. Follicular lymphoma as above
2. Status post cholecystectomy
3. Neuropathy secondary to chemotherapy
4. Status post left hip fracture [**5-/2177**]

Social History:
The patient is married and lives at home with his wife in
[**Name (NI) 43018**]. He has three children, none of whom live at home. His
wife has [**Name (NI) 2481**] dementia and receives a lot of care from
her children. The patient's daughter died at age 20 from
lymphoma (He thinks ALL).  He previously worked for NSTAR
switching lines.  He denies any tobacco or drug use.  He reports
occasional alchohol with about 1 beer per week.


Family History:
His daughter died at age 20 of lymphoma (he believes ALL). He
has an Aunt with melanoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year-old male with recurrent follicular cell lymphoma with
recent chemotherapy and radiation to L3 who was admitted for
pneumonia and sepsis.
.
1. Pneumonia: On chest x-ray, he had evidence of pneumonia.
Given that he has recently been hospitalized, he was initially
covered for both pseudomonas and MRSA with ceftazidime and
vancomycin.  On hospital day 3, his oxygen requirement increased
and he spiked a temperature; therefore, his antibiotic coverage
was broadened to include Flagyl, Caspofungin, and Bactrim.  He
improved on that regimen and his oxygen requirement decreased.
An induced sputum showed budding yeast and was negative for PCP.
 [**Name10 (NameIs) **] that time, the Flagyl and the treatment dose Bactrim was
stopped.  His oxygen requirement decreased throughout his
hospital course.  On discharge, he had completed 11 days of
vancomycin and ceftazidime and 9 days of caspofungin.  He was
discharged to complete 14 days of antibiotics with levofloxacin.
.
2. Sepsis: The source of his sepsis was likely the pneumonia.
He was adequately volume resuscitated in the emergency
department.  He was initially monitored in the intensive care
unit.  His lactate trended down with fluids and he remained
normotensive.
.
3. Lymphoma: He recently underwent a cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy
2 weeks prior to admission.  He has just completed a 10-day
course of radiation therapy for his L3 thecal sac compression.
He was admitted on a prednisone taper from his recent admission.
 When he was tapered from 40 to 20 mg of prednisone, he had
increased pain and lower extremity weakness.  Until a cervical,
thoracic, and lumbar spine MRI was negative for compression, he
was maintained on high dose dexamethasone.  He was then maintain
on 40 mg prednisone daily.  He also has C-3 disease for which he
should continue to wear his soft c-spine collar.   During this
admission, he had an increase in size of his right neck mass.
He will need his third cycle of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy once he has
recovered from his pneumonia.  He was maintain on his
allopurinol and prophylactic Bactrim.
.
4. Anion gap acidosis: He initially had an anion gap acidosis
that was likely secondary to lactate.  His anion gap acidosis
resolved with fluid resuscitation.
.
5. Acute renal failure: On admission, his BUN and creatinine
were elevated.  This was attributed to a pre-renal etiology in
the setting of decreased perfusion from sepsis.  His creatinine
returned to baseline with fluid resuscitation.
.
6. Anemia: On admission, his hematocrit was near baseline of
27-30.  His iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic
disease and his B12 and folate were normal.  His hematocrit
dropped to 18 on hospital day 1, which was likely secondary to
dilution from fluid resuscitation.  He received 1 U packed red
cell transfusion with an appropriate increase in his hematocrit.
 He hematocrit remained stable above 25 throughout the remainder
of the admission.
.
7. Hyperglycemia: He has no history of diabetes.  His elevated
glucose was likely secondary to steroids.  He wa
