Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status, Found Down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year old female with PMH of diastolic CHF,
interstitial lung disease, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presented
with AMS, fever, and tachycardia after being found down on the
floor near her bed by her nephew.  [**Name (NI) **] went to celebrate
[**Holiday 1451**] with her family, and remembers being driven home.
Her nephew stayed with her for a while after dropping her off
because he thought she was a little out of breath.  After he
left, the patient does not remember anything further.  She was
found in her pajamas next to her bed.  The patient did not
remember falling or passing out.  She woke up while on the
floor, and wondered what she was doing there, but then fell back
asleep.  Her nephew tried calling her, and when she didn't pick
up, he went over to find her laying on the floor.  On
presentation to the ED she was lethargic and A+Ox2. She arrived
complaining of shortness of breath. She denied any chest pain,
nausea, vomitting, or diarrhea.


In the ED, her initial VS were T=101.2, HR=130, BP=124/84,
RR=32, and O2 sats were not recorded. She triggered for AMS and
tachycardia in the ED upon arrival. EKG showed an irregular
tachycardia and was non-ischemic. Labs were significant for WBC
of 14.4, lactate of 1.6. CXR showed no evidence of PNA. UA
showed many bacteria but leukocyte esterase and nitrates were
negative. Her head CT was negative. An LP was unremarkable for
infection. Flu swab was sent, 1 gram of Tylenol was given for
her fever, and the patient was started on levofloxacin 750mg IV
for CAP given no other localizing findings. Her HR was
persistently in the 130s for her ED course. She was given
Diltiazem 15mg IV, then 20mg IV, and then 30mg PO. This slowed
her rate transiently to the 90s. She was then put on a diltiazem
gtt which was titrated up to 10mg/hr with persistent tachycardia
noted to the 130s. BPs were stable in the 110s systolic, but it
was felt that she would trigger on the floor for tachycardia so
she was transferred to the ICU.  She has PIV access and was
reportedly breathing comfortably, but did get 3.5 Liters of IVFs
in the ED.  Prior to transfer to the ICU, she was noted to be
afebrile, pleasant, conversive with a HR=130s, BP=137/90, and
satting 98% on 2L.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Review of systems after the patient's mental
status improved was notable for  worsening shortness of breath
over the last several few months.  She had noted a dry cough.
She denied orthopnea, fevers, chills, night sweats, change in
bowel habits, hematochezia, abdominal pain, chest pain,
palpitations, nausea, and vomiting.  No notable weight loss or
gain.  She denied PND.

Social History:
The patient lives alone and is independent with her ADLs/IADLs,
particularly she still drives, goes shopping, and is in charge
of her finances. She does have family that lives nearby, in
particular, she has a nephew who will call her on a daily basis
every morning. She reports no tobacco history and drinks alcohol
sparingly reporting less than 1 drink/week.

==============
OTHER STUDIES
==============
ECG [**2118-11-4**]:
Sinus tachycardia suggested with frequent atrial premature beats
and
occasional ventricular premature beats. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2118-4-2**] ectopy is new.

CXR [**11-4**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm and
minimal peripheral interstitial opacities likely due to
patient's underlying NSIP. No radiographic evidence of
pneumonia.

Head CT [**2118-11-4**]:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Small right
parieto-occipital
subgaleal hematoma.

CTA [**11-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of central PE. Motion at the lung bases limits
evaluation for subsegmental PE.
2. Mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria for
pathologic
enlargement.
3. Stable elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with associated
atelectasis
which appears chronic.
4. Again noted are some findings that may suggest persistent of
NSIP such as bibasilar and subpleural reticulation as well as
some parenchymal distortion. This is poorly evaluated on this
study due to technique including motion.  There is heterogenous
attenuation bilaterally which may be secondary to air trapping;
recommend clinical correlation.
5. Flattened trachea on inspiration may represent a component of

tracheomalacia.
6. Stable lung nodules.

TTE [**11-7**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. At least mild to moderate ([**12-11**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal global biventricular systolic function.
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
