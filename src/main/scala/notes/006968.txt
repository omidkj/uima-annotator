[**Year (4 digits) **] - [**2108-8-27**] - IMPRESSION:
Previously placed metal stents were noted on fluoroscopy in the
CHD and CBD.  Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted in
the major papilla
A single periampullary diverticulum with small opening was found
at the major papilla.  Cannulation of the biliary duct was
performed with a balloon catheter using a free-hand technique
Multiple filling defects were noted in the biliary tree within
the metal stents. Large amount of stone and sludge debris was
removed with a balloon catheter after multiple sweeps of the
metal stents. Occlusion cholangiogram revealed further fixed
filling defect at the proximal edge of the metal stents and the
R hepatic duct/hilum area, likely hyperplastic overgrowth of
tissue related to the metal stents. A 5cm by 10FR Double pigtail
plastic biliary stent was placed successfully with the proximal
edge in the Left hepatic duct. Contrast and bile drainage was
noted after placement of the pigtail stent
Recommendations:
Continue with IV antibiotics
Pt may resume diet
Pt will be transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] under the care of the ICU
team
[**Hospital Unit Name **] in 4 months to re-evaluate biliary tree, remove stent and
clean debris

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year-old male with hx of metastatic colon cancer in
remission, COPD, and recurrent biliary obstruction who presented
to the ED with a day of abdominal pain and fevers concerning for
cholangitis.
.
# Cholangitis and septic shock: The patient has metal biliary
stents in place which tend to have an occlusion every [**3-1**]
months. His LFTs were mildly elevated.  The patient's
hypotension was most likely due to his cholangitis.  He required
fluid resusitation, pressors, antibiotics and bowel rest.  He
was stabilized and able to undergo [**Month/Day (3) **] on [**2108-8-27**].  He had a
successful [**Date Range **] drainage of stone and sludge debris from the
stents in the common bile duct and the patient also had a
pigtail catheter placed in the left hepatic duct.  His
hypotension resolved after [**Date Range **] and he was able to be
transferred to the floor.  He will need to finish a 10 day
course of antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl) as an
outpatient.  It was recommended that he continue taking
Ursodiol.
.
# Chest pain: The patient had an episode of chest pain which was
felt to be most likely pain referred from his abdomen.  His
cardiac enzymes were negative and he did not have any EKG
changes.

hospitalization: Thrombcytopenia, COPD, Schizophrenia, GERD and
Constipation.
