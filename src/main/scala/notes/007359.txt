History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 64y/o lady with emphysema, HTN, DM, HLD, who
presents with shortness of breath. Of note, she was recently
admitted in [**2167-4-26**] for chest pain and SOB. She required a
non-rebreather and was admitted to the MICU where CXR, CTA
chest, EKG, and cardiac enzymes were all reassuring. She was
given nebs, oxygen was weaned, and she was called out to the
floor. Her hospital course was complicated by a mechanical fall
in which she sustained an intertrochanteric left femoral
fracture s/p ORIF. She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on Lovenox
on [**2167-6-1**].

short of breath a week after arriving.  Had some leg edema and
weight gain.  Some wheezing as well.  Denied chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain.  Pulmonary consult was obtained.  She
was started on Lasix 40mg (in mid-[**Month (only) 116**]) and was continued on nebs
for COPD.  Patient became progressively dyspneic despite
treatment and presented to the ED when she was noted to appear
extremely uncomfortable in her breathing.

In the ED patient triggered for respiratory distress with
initial VS 97.5, 99, 154/60, 31, 88%RA. EKG showed sinus 95, no
ischemic changes. Patient was given nebs, solumedrol, and
started on BIPAP. Labs notable for nml WBC, nml lactate, neg
trop, Na 148. ABG was 7.31/82/105/43. CXR showed right-sided
atalectasis vs. infiltrate. CTA chest neg for PE. CT head neg
for acute process. Patient was intubated for increasing
obtundation. AC, TV 400, PEEP 5, FiO2 60, RR 18. ABG
post-extubation was 7.39/64/83/40, so RR was increased. She
received cefepime and levofloxacin for possible pneumonia. VS
prior to transfer were 104/59, 73, 20, 99% on vent.

On arrival to the MICU, patient is intubated and sedated.
Current vent settings are AC, VT 400, PEEP 5, RR 20, FIO2 60%.

ECG [**2167-7-5**]  11:30:26 PM
Sinus rhythm. Isolated ventricular premature contractions. No
interval change compared to the previous tracing.

CXR [**2167-7-5**]
1.  Findings suggesting moderate pulmonary edema.
2.  Consolidation suspected in the left lower lobe.
3.  Patchy right lower lung opacification; an area of confluent
edema could be considered versus an additional early developing
focus of infection.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS [**2167-7-5**]
1.  No pulmonary embolus to the proximal segmental levels.  Mild
cardiomegaly and atherosclerosis.
2.  Multifocal atelectasis, with probable lower lobe
consolidation suggesting pneumonia as the main etiology for
pulmonary decompensation.  Mild pulmonary edema and small
bilateral effusions.
3.  Endotracheal tube terminates 2.5 cm above the carina;
retracting the tube slightly further is suggested.
4.  Right adrenal adenoma.
5.  Chronic T8 compression deformity.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2167-7-5**]
No evidence of acute intracranial process.

CHEST U.S. [**2167-7-13**] 3:59 PM
Normal diaphragmatic movement on inspiration as described.  No
ultrasound features to suggest diaphragmatic paralysis.
