Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 848**]
Chief Complaint:
seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 45 year old man with a history of epilepsy
(since childhood), substance abuse, and chronic pain (on
methadone) presenting as a transfer from an outside facility for
status epilepticus in the setting of rapid anticonvulsant and
benzodiazepine withdrawal. A more detailed history could not be
obtained at this time due to the patient's intubated status and
inattentiveness, so this information is primarily obtained from
the transferred records from [**Hospital6 3105**]. He
reportedly has been underreporting his seizure frequency to his
outpatient physicians (his neurologist is Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in order to
avoid losing the legal ability to drive. He was admitted for
long-term monitoring to evaluate his seizures. His carbamazepine
level at admission was low. He had several typical seizures
which
were described as left head version followed by opisthotonus,
lasting minutes and followed by post-ictal confusion and
aggressive behavior. He was restarted back on Tegretol and
Depakote but continued to have clusters of seizures, including
events where he fell out of bed. Due to the increased frequency
and difficulty with managing his post-ictal aggression, he was
sedated and intubated. He reportedly also might have
intranasally
inhaled crushed pills brought to him by a friend (reportedly
alprazolam, a plastic tube was found in his bed), resulting in
somnolence and some missed doses of anticonvulsants; this was a
behavior previously suspected prior to admission when it was
thought that he was abusing alprazolam to self-medicate for
anxiety and possibly his seizures. Attempts to wean propofol
reportedly resulted in return of seizure activity, so he was
kept
sedated and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He was
also being treated for Str. pneumonia growing from a sputum
culture. His abdomen was also moderately distended which was
thought to be secondary to constipation. He had a total of 3.5
days of EMU monitoring and 5 days of ICU care.

Since arrival, we have been decreasing his propofol infusion
with
hopes of improving his level of awareness in anticipation of
extubation. His mental status has remained suppressed.

His seizure disorder is thought to have started at age 16 after
a
head injury from a motor vehicle collision that resulted in loss
of consciousness and coma. His initial seizure semiology
reportedly involved right eye gaze deviation with subsequent
giggling or other vocalized sounds and then secondary
generalized
tonic-clonic activity. He would have post-ictal confusion and
lethargy subsequently. He did not often have urinary
incontinence. He did not usually bite his tongue.

Past Medical History:
[] Neurologic - Epilepsy (described as frontal lobe, since his
teenage years, reportedly after having suffered a head injury in
a motor vehicle collision)
[] MSK - Prior L1-L2 transverse process fracture, Chronic pain
(on methadone), per OMR R ankle repair

[] Gastrointestinal - per OMR s/p appendectomy
[] Hematologic - per OMR s/p splenectomy


Social History:
Current tobacco use, unquantified. Some ETOH,
unquantified. Not known if he uses illicit drugs, but he is
thought to overuse/abuse alprazolam. Construction worker.

Family History:
Twin. No known history of epilepsy.

REPORTS:

CXR [**2116-4-13**]: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the patient has been intubated. The tip of the endotracheal tube
projects 6.4 cm above the carina. Patient also has a left than a
right central venous access line as well as a normally
positioned nasogastric tube. There is left retrocardiac
atelectasis but no evidence of aspiration or pneumonia. Minimal
fluid overload. No pleural effusions. Normal size of the cardiac
silhouette.

CXR [**2116-4-18**]: FINDINGS: Nasogastric tube has been repositioned,
with tip located more proximally within the stomach. Side port
is not well visualized. Heart size is normal, and lungs are
grossly clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
45yoM with PMHx of epilepsy, substance abuse, prior L1-L2
transverse process fracture and chronic pain who p/w difficult
to control seizures in the setting of a rapid BZD and
anticonvulsant withdrawal during a planned long-term monitoring
admission.

# NEURO:  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on four anticonvulsants
and a propofol infusion. Continuous video EEG was initiated
which revealed an encephalopathic pattern without seizures. His
propofol infusion was weaned off. He was successfully extubated
and his medications were adjusted.  On discharge he was on
valproate 750mg Q6H, carbamezepine 400/600/600 and phenytoin
100mg TID.  His medication side effects improved on this dosing
and he was able to walk and had no double vision.  He did
complain of some blurred vision that he felt was related to his
glasses being the wrong prescription.  We recommended that he
visit his opthalmologist for this issue.

# ID: pt was put on ABx on [**4-15**] for HCAP, which were broadened,
and continued until [**4-22**] for an 8 day total course..

# PULM: we continued pt's albuterol and advair.

# PSYCH: we continued pt's fluoxetine and methadone. We
decreased the pt's seroquel dose given h
