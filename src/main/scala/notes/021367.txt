US guided absess drain: IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided
placement of an 8 French pigtail catheter into pelvic/abdominal
fluid. A total of 500 cc of sanguinous feculent-smelling fluid
was aspirated. A portion of the fluid was sent for microbiology,
Gram stain, cell count and bilirubin as ordered by the surgeons
taking care of the patient. The case was then discussed with the
primary surgical team.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-17**] for an incracerated
ventral hernia and acute renal failure. He was taken to the OR
on [**3-17**] for repair of ventral hernia and a small bowel resection
without complications. Please see the operative report for
further details. He did well initially and was transferred to
the floor.  He did require 4 units of blood in the first 4 post
operative days but was always hemodynamically stable.  While on
the floor he developed a post-operative ileus and a CT was
obtained on POD 7 which revealed multiple fluid collections and
contrast through to the colon.  He did have a fair amount of
free air on that CT possibly consistent with post-op changes.
He also had a troponin leak with out EKG changes.
A percutaneous drain was placed on POD8 and his abdominal pain
improved.  This grew out multiple organisms.  He was stable.
However he subsequently developed increased distension and his
WBC count was elevated on POD 11.  He also had a worsening
respiratory status and increased fluid requirement and the
decision was made to take him back to the OR for exploration.
  A small bowel leak was identified and his intestine was
re-resected.  He was taken to the ICU and extubated.  However
his respiratory status was borderline and he required
reintubation and tracheostomy for airway protection.  He was
treated for ventilatory associated pneumonia and subsequently
transferred to the floor.
   At this time neurologically he requires small amounts of
haldol and ativan for agitation.  He is responsive and follows
commands. He is cardiovascularly stable in a first degreee AV
block.  He is on Lipitor and lopressor and aspirin.  He is not
in CHF.  From a respiratory perspective he is a trach mask
saturating well in the high nineties.  He is tolerating goal
tube feed via a post-pyloric dobhoff tube and having formed
stools on a regular basis.  His renal function is at his
baseline and he requires daily lasix.  He is only mildly fluid
overloaded which should imporve over the next few weeks.  He has
a indwelling foley.  He is off all antibiotics.

He should continue to recieve DVT prophylaxis.
