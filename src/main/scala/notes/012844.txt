History of Present Illness:
67 YO F with HTN, CAD, COPD, h/o craniotomy, duraplasty, and VP
shunt for HTN encephalopathy who was initially presented [**2-7**]
w/increased lethargy and found to have bilateral subdural
hematomas secondary to fall (unclear etiology) and admitted to
neurosurgery. Neurosurg recommended conservative therapy and
watch patient with serial CT scans and held anticoagulation. Pt
was loaded on dilantin for question of seizures. Patient became
increasingly agitated and ativan/haldol was given, and
subsequently she was intubated for MS changes and placed on
propofol. Patient then became hypotensive and neosynephrine was
started, although her BP meds were continued during this time.
Sepsis was thought to be likely given fevers to 101.4. In
setting of neo had elevation in troponin to. She only remained
intubated for one day and was quickly weaned off of the neo
after extubation.
Pt had recent long admission in [**2143-10-25**] with right ischemic
foot admitted to vascular for rAKA, found unresponsive and
intubated w/MRI showed non-communicating hydrocephalous (htn
encephalopathy). NSICU put craniotomy, VP shunt, and
duraplastly. The course was prolonged with respiratory failure,
pulmonary edema (reintubated X 3), klebsiella PNA, and NSTEMI
but pt was eventually sent to rehab. Was readmitted [**1-9**] for
revision R AKA which now shows dehiscence of medial aspect, no
infection.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: 97.5 110/70 76 20 100% 2L NC FS 114 wt 46.2 kg
Gen: somnolent and difficult to arouse.
HEENT: MMM with white covering on tongue and roof of mouth.
PERRLA, EOMI.
Neck: with extremely limited range of motion. Denies pain on
passive rotation but only able to move neck approximately 10
degrees to either side. Flexion and extension extremely limited.
CV: distant HS, difficult to appreciate with copious upper
airway noise.
Lungs: loud upper airway noise.
Abd: PEG in place with no erythema or tenderness. soft,
non-tender, non-distended. + well healed midline scar through
midline below umbilicus.
Ext: R leg s/p AKA with dressing c/d/i. L leg with no c/c/e. No
pulses palpable in L foot, but is warm with some hair on dorsal
aspect of foot.
Neuro: awakens with repeated verbal stimulus. Opens eyes,

to side. palate elevates with tongue movements in tact.
sensation grossly in tact. Motor: moves all extremities.

Pertinent Results:
CT spine: There is no obvious fracture or subluxation.
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine are noted. Perhaps an
MR examination would be helpful to examine for the presence of
perivertebral edema.

Head CT: Left subdural hematoma with mild midline shift.

Echo (TTE): 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-15**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a
loculated
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

MRI head:
1) No area of restricted diffusion is seen to suggest a recent
infarct. There is an area of T2 shine through in the left
parietal white matter, present on [**2144-1-6**].

2) There is extensive left-sided subdural hematoma, which
measures less than 1 cm in maximal thickness. The septum
pellucidum is bowed slightly towards the right and the left
lateral ventricle is smaller than the right, as was seen on the
earlier CT. There is slight asymmetry of the medial temporal
lobes and mid brain, although the ambient cistern remains
patent.

3) There is a much smaller right-sided subdural collection, too
small to be visualized on the CT.

4) The left frontal shunt catheter is again noted.

5) The posterior fossa postoperative changes and
encephalomalacia in the left cerebellar hemisphere are again
noted.

6) There are mild microvascular changes in the cerebral white
matter.

MRA head:
There is segmental decreased flow in the siphons, which appears
to be artifactual with good distal flow noted. The study is
slightly limited by patient motion.


Brief Hospital Course:
##MS changes: The patients MS drastically improved from
admission to discharge. The alterations were thought to be
likely [**1-15**] SDH's, also s/p intubation with sedation and use of
psych meds of haldol, ativan, olanzapine, and lexapro. When all
of these were discontinued and the pt no longer required
sedation, her MS improved. Blood gases were normal and an LP
ruled out infectious causes. She still remains A&O to person and
place, but not to time. Her family states this is not far from
her baseline.
.
## SDH with ?seizures and ?CVA: the pt was monitored in the
neuro ICU and managed conservatively. After serial CT's showed
that the SDH was stable she was transferred to the floor and
further head CT's also showed no change. She was also followed
by neurology who recommended continuing dilantin for seizure ppx
since her husband was not sure if he had witnessed her
experiencing shaking in a seizure-like manner. Also, a seizure
could have caused her original fall. An MRI was performed which
was read by some to have a small CVA in watershed territories,
although the final read does not call this. She will follow up
with neurology and neurosurgery as an outpatient.
.
##BP: has h/o HTN, but was hypotensive in unit in setting of
?sepsis. She was on neosynephrine for approx 24 hours, but then
weaned easily and soon began having HTN again. Her BP meds were
titrated for target sBP of 130-160 given recent SDH and
questionable CVA. She will continue on Toprol XL and lisinopril
and follow up with her PCP as an outpatient.
.
## Fevers to 101.2 with elevated WBC: The patient was diagnosed
with a vent-associated pna while in the MICU and treated with a
10 day course of IV Zosyn. Her cough improved and she remained
afebrile once transferred to the floor. Sputum cx, Bcx and Ucx
were negative. C.diff was also negative and WBC count trended
down.
.
## Cardiac: patient with elevated troponin in setting of neo
use. She ruled in for an MI w/ trop positive. In past
hospitalization troponin elevation felt secondary to demand and
this was the case during this elevation as well. Aspirin held
secondary to subdural, BB, statin, and ACEi were started. TTE
showed a possible pericardial effusion, however, upon d/w cards,
it was felt that a TEE not needed since this "fat pad vs.
loculated pericardia
