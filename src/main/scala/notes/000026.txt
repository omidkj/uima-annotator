Brief Hospital Course:
1)Upper GI bleed: Patient was on coumadin for recent hx of PE
and received 4 units of FFP and vit K in the EW to correct his
INR.  Coumadin was held intinitally for possible active bleed.
GI was consulted and EGD was done on [**2165-8-2**] which showed an
ulcer in the distal esophagus with active bleeding from that
site.  Successful clipping of the vessel was achieved using a
Resolution Endoclip device and then injected with epinephrine
for hemostasis.  Patient received total of 3 units of PRBC.
Patient was continued on PPI for prophylaxis and serial
hematocrit was done which remained stable (Hct>30).

2)Neuro: Patient has a hx of intracranial bleed s/p basilar
stent.  Patient on Plavix and [**Date Range **] for post-stent prophylaxis.
Patient remained lethargic which is his baseline.  He was able
to follow simple commands at times, moving his hands and feet
and occasionally giving verbal response.  Per family member,
patient appears to be more alert than before.  Neurosurgery
following this patient and strongly urged to hold Coumadin for
the risk of re-bleeding intracranially.  After discussion with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] from neurosurgery, it was decided to discharge patient
with Lovenox.

3)A-fib: During EGD proceduse, clipping of the bleeding vessel
was done and epinephrine was injected to that site.  Right after
the epinephrine was injected, he went into rapid afib to 150's
with ST depressions.  He was given a total of 10 mg of lopressor
with some decrease in his HR to the 120's-130's.  After 10 mg of
IV diltiazem, his HR came down to the 90's-100's and his BP
dropped to the 80's briefly.  MI was ruled out with serial
cardiac enzymes and he was given 25 mg of lopressor.  Patient
remained on sinus tachycardia, and lopressor was titrated up to
50 mg tid.  Patient did show good response to IV diltiazem 10
mg.

4)PE prophylaxis: Patient initially on Coumadin 12.5 mg qd and
Dalteparin 7500 units [**Hospital1 **], but were held due to GI bleed with
INR 2.9 and PTT 37.  Neurosurgery seen the patient and strongly
discouraged discontinuing Coumadin due to recent history of
intracranial bleed.  However, patient just had PE and is at risk
for another thrombotic event.  After discussion with the
neurosrugery attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**], it was decided to discharge
the patient with Lovenox.

5)ID: On [**8-4**] sputum gram stain showed gram positive cooci and
rhonchi on exam.  CXR intially appeared as LLL opacity so
Vancomycin 1 g q12 was started.  However after reviewing the
film with the team on [**2165-8-5**], CXR was more consistent with
fluid overload with effusion than consolidation.  Since patient
is afebrile with normal WBC and not showing symptom of
pneumonia, Vancomycin was discontinued.
