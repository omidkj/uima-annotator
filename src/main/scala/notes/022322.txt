Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Renal Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral trialysis catheter placement [**2185-7-14**], removed
[**2185-7-23**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] is a 39 year-old male with h/o Prader-Willi
Syndrome, T2DM, HTN, s/p recent trach (for respiratory failure)
and [**Doctor First Name 48**] who presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with worsening renal
failure requiring hemodialysis. The patient was reportedly in
his USOH until 1 week ago when he was noted to develop an
elevated Cr. Per his sister, patient was also noted to have a
decline in his UO, although no formal documentation of this is
available. His Cr and BUN have progressively been increasing (Cr
10 days ago was 1.2 --> 5.5 now; BUN 115; K 5.7). He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for tunneled line placement and
hemodialysis.
.
Upon admission, patient was alert, following simple commands. No
evidence of asterixis. Patient had Foley placed at [**Hospital 100**] rehab,
but no renal ultrasound to fully r/o post obstructive etiology
for [**Doctor First Name 48**]. Per provided nursing notes, no recent contrast agents,
NSAIDS, or ACE/[**Last Name (un) **]. Patient had been on Vanco PO for C-diff.

EKG:  NSR 65, RAD1st deg AV delay, poor baseline but no peaked

.
Relevant imaging data:
[**2185-7-13**] CXR: The study is markedly limited.  There is left
lower lobe opacity, which may appear slightly increased compared
with the previous
study.  These findings may represent superimposed pneumonia or
aspiration.
.
[**2185-7-14**] Renal U/S: Examination limited due to body habitus and
patient's condition. The kidneys are not visualized.
.
[**2185-7-15**] ECHO: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). The distal third of the left
ventricle is
not well seen. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal WMA
cannot be fully excluded. RV chamber size and free wall motion
are grossly normal. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No MVP. PA systolic
pressure could not be quantified. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2185-7-19**] Cystoscopy with retrograde pyelogram: Normal
radiographic appearance of the left ureter and renal calices
without evidence of hydronephrosis, stricture, or filling
defects.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] is a 39 year-old male with morbid obesity, Prader
Willi syndrome, T2DM, CRI, status post tracheostomy, transferred
from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab for acute on chronic renal failure. His
hospital course will be reviewed by problems.
.
# RENAL FAILURE:
As noted above, his creatinine on admission was elevated at 5.8.
The etiology of his renal failure was initially unclear, and
further work-up was initiated. He did not have an indication for
emergent dialysis. Intravenous access was obtained via a
trialysis catheter in the right femoral vein on [**2185-7-14**], and
large volume resuscitation was administered with crystalloid and
RBC transfusion, without improvement in his creatinine. Urine
lytes, although initially suggestive of low FeNa, subsequently
showed elevated FeUrea >35% not consistent with a pure pre-renal
physiology. Renal was involved throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
stay. Renal imaging was complicated by the patient's body
habitus, and a renal ultrasound could not visualize either
kidney given the depth of soft tissue obscuring the windows. MRI
or CT was not an option given the patient's habitus and weight.
In order to exclude obstruction, urology was consulted, and a
cystoscopy with retrograde pyelography was performed, remarkable
for normal radiographic appearance of the left ureter and renal
calices without evidence of hydronephrosis, stricture, or
filling defects.
.
Given the above work-up, decision was then made to initiate
hemodialysis. He had a first session on [**2185-7-20**], then [**7-21**] and
[**7-22**]. His right femoral Quinton catheter was removed on [**7-23**]
after adequate alternate access was obtained via a left-sided
PICC.  Attempt to place a tunneled hemodialysis catheter on
[**2185-7-28**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 99959**] was unsucessful in the OR.  Plans
were made to place an AV graft on [**7-30**] however this was again
unsuccessful, and patient was taken back to the OR on [**7-31**] where
he had a cut down tunneled R Quinton placed.  HD was thus
initiated on [**7-31**], and then again on [**8-1**].
He remains on Renagel and Calcium acetate for hyperphosphatemia,
along with EPO with HD.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:
Pt chronically trach'd for h/o obesity hypoventilation, multiple
episodes of respiratory distress requring vntilator support,
with h/o of multiple VAP.  The ventilatory parameters were
slightly altered. He is currently on PS 22/10, FiO2=0.40.
Please continue these parameters at rehab.
.
# PNEUMONIA:
While in the hospital, his WBC was noted to rise. Sputum
cultures from [**2185-7-14**] grew Acinetobacter sensitive to Unasyn
but resistant to Zosyn, and MRSA.  He was placed on Unasyn and
Vancomycin on [**7-18**] (day 1), and completed a 14-day course with
last doses on [**2185-7-31**].  In addtion, pt is being treated with po
vancomycin for concern about c. diff, and should continue to be
treated for 14 days s/p [**7-31**] (the last day of his unasyn course),
ending on [**2185-8-14**].
.
# HYPOTHYROID:
Mr. [**Known lastname 34682**] has a known history of hypothyroidism. At the time
of admission, his TSH was elevated at 77, with low free T4 0.4.
Endocrine was consulted, with recommendation to initiate IV
levothyroxine given possible poor gut absorption. He was
therefore placed on Levothyroxine 200 mcg daily, with
improvement in his TSH to 11 and free T4 to 0.9 on [**2185-7-21**].
