History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 y/o M with a history Ichemic CM with a
history of VTach s/p ICD placement, s/p three prior ablations.
The patient has a history of [**Hospital1 **]-monthly episodes of syncope
associated with appropriate ICD firing. Over the past two days,
the patient states that his ICD has fired while he is conscious.
Pt stated that two days ago his ICD fired three times, then
fired another two times yesterday, and then once more this
evening that led him to seek medical attention in the ER. The
patient has been on Meiiletine and Dofetilide, and the plan has
been for patient to switch to dronetarone as patient has failed
prior medical therapy.

In the ED, the patient's VS were 98 69 130/63 16 99%RA. EKG AV
paced similar to prior. EP was consulted and recommended
admission. Interrogation revealed slow VT at 140s, patient's
settings were not changed this evening. Labs only notable for K
3.9. Recevied 40mEq PO KCl. On transfer, VS were Afeb, 70,
107/57, 16, 100% RA.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ECG: A-V sequential paced rhythm. Premature ventricular
contraction or fusion
beat. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2129-6-29**] the
ventricular premature
beat or fusion beat is new.

TTE [**12-26**]: The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with some preservation of the basal septal wall
(LVEF = [**11-23**] %). The inferior and inferolateral walls are
thinned and akinetic. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-10**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe dilated left venticular cardiomyopathy with
akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis
of the remainder of the ventricle. Mild right ventricular
dilation with moderate global hypokinesis. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2126-3-8**], the left ventricle is more dilated,
and systolic function is more impaired.

CXR [**12-26**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2129-6-22**],
the endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 8.2 cm above the
carina and is at the mid clavicular level.

Pacemaker device is in place. Continued substantial enlargement
of the
cardiac silhouette with minimal prominence of interstitial
markings consistent with mild elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure. No evidence of pleural effusion or acute pneumonia.

Of incidental note is prosthetic right shoulder.

[**12-26**] Cath lab: placement of IABP

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old male with a history of ischemic CM and VTach s/p ICD
placement with three prior ablations p/w VT storm.

# VT storm: He has had three failed VT ablations in the past and
on admission, interrogation of his ICD showed slow VT with
appropriate firing of his ICD.  He was on mixiletine and Tikosyn
on admission, and had been in the process of getting insurance
approval for dronedarone.  His digoxin was stopped on admission
and his was monitored on telemetry.  He had multiple episodes of
VTach on the floor with ICD firing and he had some transient
hypotension treated with IV fluid bolus.  He was transferred to
the CCU for an amiodarone load and drip.  At that time, the
excess fluid given via bolus earlier was diuresed off.  The
patient continued to experience recurrent runs of ventricular
tachycardia on amiodarone, though the frequency began to
decrease.  Once his loading was complete and the drip stopped,
the patient again had recurrent VT several times an hour(with
ICD firing).  The patient was bolused with lidocaine, started on
lidocaine gtt, and restarted on amiodarone gtt.
.
The patient continued to experience runs of ventricular
tachycardia causing hemodynamic instability at slower rates
(110s-120s) than before (140s-160s).  The patient was electively
intubated and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.  It was
determined that the VT storm was refractory to medical
management and the next best course of action would be heart
transplant.
.
The patient had been previously screened at [**Hospital1 2025**] for cardiac
transplantation.  Given his current clinical situation, he would
likely be at the top of the list for transplant.  The case was
discussed amongst Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) 437**], as well as physicians
at [**Hospital1 2025**], and it was decided that the patient would benefit from
transfer as soon as medically stable.
.
# Coronaries: His cardiomyopathy is related to ischemia.  It is
not clear whether his VT represents a new scar-mediated focus.
He was continued on a statin and aspirin.  His beta-blocker and
ACEI were held in the setting of hemodynamic instability.
.
#. Code Status: He was FULL CODE during this hospitalization.
