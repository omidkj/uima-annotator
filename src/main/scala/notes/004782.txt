PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, blood pressure 94/40,
pulse 30s, oxygen saturation 99%, CMV 250 22 100%, 7.5
positive end-expiratory pressure.  Neurologically Ms [**Known lastname 9935**]
is alert and oriented.  Her heart is regular.  Her lungs were
coarse bilaterally.  Abdomen is with air tube in place.  She
is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities are remarkable
for 1 to 2+ edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms [**Known lastname 9935**] was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit where she was stabilized from a cardiac and
respiratory standpoint.  She was treated with Vancomycin and
Ceftazidime intravenously.  She was also treated with Zosyn.
Ms [**Known lastname 9935**] was diuresed with Lasix and Diamox.  Her vent was
progressively weaned.  She received 1 unit of packed red
blood cells for a hematocrit of 23.  Ms [**Known lastname 11234**] condition
gradually improved.  She was continued on antibiotics and
diuresis.  She was also treated with aggressive suctioning
for thick secretions through her tracheostomy.  Several
bronchoscopies were performed for further evaluation and
treatment of these secretions.  Ms [**Known lastname 9935**] was eventually
weaned off of the vent and received oxygen through her
tracheostomy.  Respiratory status continued to improve and
she was subsequently transferred to the floor on [**2138-7-24**].  On the floor, Ms [**Known lastname 9935**] was cycled with nasal
cannula oxygen with her tracheostomy capped.  She was
progressively able to tolerate this, eventually requiring
only nasal cannula oxygen.  She continued to receive tube
feeds at this time.  However, she was able to gradually
increase her oral intake and the tube feeds were subsequently
decreased and eventually discontinued.  Ms [**Known lastname 9935**] continued
to improve and was able to clear her thick secretions by
coughing and without the use of frequent suctioning.  She was
able to ambulate well with physical therapy.  Sputum culture
samples were remarkable for coagulase positive
Staphylococcus.  She was continued on a course of Vancomycin.
On [**2138-8-1**], Ms [**Known lastname 9935**] was able to tolerate an oral
diet.  She was breathing comfortably on nasal cannula oxygen.
She was able to ambulate well.  She was subsequently felt
stable to be discharged home.

Physical examination on discharge revealed vital signs
temperature 96, pulse 111, blood pressure 110/55,
respirations 18 and oxygen saturation 94% on room air.  Heart
is regular.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities, remarkable for trace edema.
