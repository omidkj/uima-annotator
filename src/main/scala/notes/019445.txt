Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-6-10**] Cardiac catheterization
[**2162-6-11**] Mitral valve repair (28 CE [**Doctor Last Name **] ring)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90375**] is a 61 year old female who was found in [**2159**] to
have asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response. An  extensive cardiac workup demonstrated moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation, a dialated cardiomyopathy with
globally depressed left ventricular function and an left
ventricular ejection function of 25-30%. She underwent left and
right cardiac catheterization, and was found to have
moderate-severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP of 59mmHg), an
elevated left sided filling pressures (PCWP 31mmHg), and normal
coronary arteries. Follow up TEE in [**Location (un) 73375**] NJ, which showed a
normalization of her LVEF, but persistent severe mitral
regurgitation. She recently saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2162-4-12**] and
underwent an echo on [**2162-4-23**]. Echo again revealed 3+ mitral
regurgitation with an LVEF of 50% and she presented for surgical
evaluation for mitral valve surgery. Currently she is reporting
worsening fatigue and shortness of breath. She denies chest
pain, orthopnea, PND, pedal edema, syncope and presyncope.

CXR
COMPARISON: [**2162-6-14**].

FINDINGS: There has been interval removal of the central venous
catheters and
placement of a left PICC which ends in the upper-to-mid SVC.
There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac and mediastinal
silhouettes are
stable after MVR. Right basilar atelectasis is stable.

IMPRESSION: Left PICC ends in upper-to-mid SVC.

EEG
OBJECT: TONIC/CLONIC SEIZURE. R/O EPILEPSY.

FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: The left posterior quadrant showed mixed delta
and
theta frequency slowing with syharp contours.
BACKGROUND: An 8 Hz posterior dominant rhythm was seen in the
waking
state which attenuated with eye opening.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness and

attained stage II sleep briefly.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 80 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence
of left
posterior quadrant slowing with sharp contours which represents
focal
subcortical dysfunction and may possibly represent cortical
irritability. There were no clear electrographic seizures or
epileptiform discharges.

COMPARISON: CT head [**2162-6-12**], cerebral angiogram [**2162-6-11**], and
CTA head
[**2162-6-11**].
FINDINGS:
There are multiple areas of slow diffusion in the right frontal
and parietal lobe and a punctate area of slow diffusion in the
right occipital lobe with T2 and FLAIR signal changes suggesting
watershed infarcts. There is no intracranial mass. The major
dural venous sinuses are probably patent. There is partial
agenesis of the corpus callosum. The sella is empty. The major
intracranial vascular flow voids are [**Month/Day/Year 48613**]. Mild mucosal
thickening in the paranasal sinuses and fluid in the bilateral
mastoid air cells are shown.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple areas of slow diffusion in the right frontal and
parietal lobes
and a punctate slow diffusion in the right occipital lobe
suggesting acute
watershed infarcts.
2. Partial agenesis of corpus callosum.
3. Empty sella.

Echocardiogram
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated LV cavity. Mild global LV
hypokinesis. Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
to severe (3+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
Physiologic (normal) PR.
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). . [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse
and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function is slightly decreased compared to prebypass
(LVEF~35%) There is a ring prosthesis in the mitral position. No
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 48613**]. The TR is now mild. The study is otherwise
unchanged from prebypass.
