transfer from [**Hospital3 **] hospital for cardiac catherization and
management of chst pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
55 yo female with type I diabetes on NPH, Ultralente, and RISS,
complicated by retinopathy (blindness), nephropathy, neuropathy,
and gastroparesis, with long standing dyspnea on exertion was
transferred tonight from [**Hospital3 **] hospital where she was
admitted on [**2188-3-20**] for SOB at rest and midsternal chest
pressure, and found to have CHF and HTN (240/120).  She had
negative cardiac enzymes and was diuresed.  She had a an
elevated d-dimer, but negative LENIs and negative v/q scan.  She
was continued on her come BP regimen but was also started on
norvasc 10mg.  Her lisinopril and HCTZ are being held in
anticipation of dye load for cath and she started on mucomyst.
She asked to be transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] because her nephrologist is
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10083**].  She was unaware that she was transferred for
cardiac catherization/renal arteriogram.  Today given Kayexelate
for k6.0, that supposedly came down to 5.2, although not
included in data sent over.
.
She was hospitalized [**12-24**] for hypertensive emergency, found to
have encephalopathy that rapidly imrpoved (had word finding
difficulty, nausea, and vomiting).  She was started on diltiazem
which was titrated over the past month to 240mg daily.
.
ROS:
She denies PND and orthopnea.  Has DOE with stairs.  Ambulates
without assistance.  She has noticed that her pants have been
alittle tighter recently.  Dry weight around 157.  Has had b/l
le edema for a few months.  Her fingersticks normally are around
150 but in the past few weeks have been 200s and uncontrolled
since admission to [**Hospital3 **].

At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital:

CXR - c/w CHR (repeated here similarly c/w CHF with no
infiltrates noted)

EKG:
OSH echo [**2188-1-1**]: mild LV dysfunction, mild LVH

PMIBI:
1. No ischemic symptoms or ECG changes. She had an appropriate
hemodynamic response. Image quality is adequate but limited due
to breast attenuation, left arm attenuation, and patient motion.

2. The left ventricular cavity size is increased with stress
compared to rest. The right ventricle appears normal. Stress
perfusion images show a moderate reduction in photon counts
involving the mid and distal anterior wall. Rest perfusion
images show that this defect is reversible.
3. Stress perfusion images also show a moderate reduction in
photon counts involving the entire inferior wall and the basal
inferolateral wall. Rest perfusion images show that this defect
is reversible.
4. Gated images show mild global hypokinesis. The calculated
left ventricular ejection fraction was 45%.
   IMPRESSION:
1. Reversible, small, moderate intensity perfusion defect
involving the LAD (diagonal) territory.
2. Reversible, medium sized, moderate intensity perfusion defect

involving the PDA territory.
3. Transient left ventricular cavity dilation consistent with
multi-vessel disease.
4. Mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild global
hypokinesis.
5. suggestive of three-vessel disease.

MRI/MRA kidneys: no RAS or other masses.

cardiac catheterization [**2188-2-1**]: 1.  Selective coronary
angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated three (3)
vessel coronary artery disease.  The right coronary artery had a
proximal 70% lesion along with a mid vessel 50% lesion.  The
RPDA had a 50% lesion at the origin.  The left main demonstrated
no angiographic evidence of any flow limiting lesions.  The left
anterior descending artery was heavily calcified with a 90% mid
vessel stenosis partially involving the 2nd diagonal.  The left
circumflex demonstrated an OM1 with a 70% tubular lesion.
2.  Selective angiography of the renal arteries demonstrated a
30%
ostial lesion in the left renal artery along with a normal right
renal
artery.
3.  LV ventriculography was deferred due to concerns of her
renal
function and recent echocardiogram.
4.  Limited hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right and left
heart
filling pressures.  No significant pressure gradient recorded
across the
aortic valve upon pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta.

5.  Elevated central pressure (186/80 mm Hg).
     FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure by recent echocardiogram.

[**2188-2-5**] ECHO
PRE-CPB There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal
cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation
is seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB There is low normal RV systolic function. Global LV
systolic function is also low normal - EF = 50-55%. There is
mild apical and septal hypokinesis. Trivial MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] other changes
from pre-CPB.

[**2188-2-7**] Chest X-Ray
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG recently.
The appearance of the heart and mediastinum are satisfactory for
recent aspiration. The lung volumes are low. No evidence of
significant amount of pleural fluid or congestive heart failure
is present. No evidence of pneumothorax is seen. The patient's
ET tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, NG tube, and two left chest tubes
were removed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12262**] is a 55 yo woman with DM and poorly controlled HTN,
admitted with HTN urgency and transferred for cardiac evaluation
and renal artery evaluation.  On arrival to the outside hospital
her BP was found to be 240/120.  She was continued there on her
usual 5 drug regimen with adequate control. She was subsequently
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Her blood
pressure remained relatively easy to control, even after holding
her [**Last Name (un) **] and ACE inhibitor.  Workup for secondary causes of
hypertension was negative for renin/aldosterone and renal artery
stenosis. Urine free cortisol was still pending on discharge.
After treating her hypertensio
