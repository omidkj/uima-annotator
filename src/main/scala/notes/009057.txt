CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-9-28**] 8:53 PM
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:r/o retroperitoneal hematoma
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. Right inguinal hernia containing a small section of small
bowel at its proximal most aspect. No evidence for bowel
obstruction or ischemia.
3. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease throughout the aorta.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2185-9-29**] 10:49 AM
Reason: PRE-OP CABG assess for stenosis
HISTORY: 84-year-old man preop CABG, assess for stenosis. Right
IJV line.
FINDINGS: The cervical portions of the carotid and vertebral
arteries were examined with duplex ultrasound bilaterally.
Wall thickening is present in the right carotid artery. The peak
systolic velocities of the right internal, common, and external
carotid arteries are 72, 47 and 43 cm/sec respectively. The
right ICA-CCA ratio is 1.53.
Mild wall thickening is seen in the left carotid artery. The
peak systolic velocities of the left internal, common, and
external carotid arteries are 64, 61 and 46 cm/sec respectively.
The left ICA-CCA ratio is 1.04.
There is appropriate antegrade flow in the left vertebral
artery. The right vertebral artery could not be visualized.
Overall, visibility on the right was less clear than on the
left. This nonvisualization most likely related to technical
factors. If there is concern for a vertebral artery stenosis on
the right (i.e., the patient has symptoms referable to the
posterior circulation of the brain), then a follow-up study or
an alternative study (such as a CTA or MRA) could clarify.
IMPRESSION: Minor wall thickening in the carotid arteries with
no significant carotid stenosis (evaluated as less than 40%
stenosis bilaterally).

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2185-9-29**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall
left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved (LVEF 60%),
although the
inferior and posterior walls appear hypokinetic. No masses or
thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2185-10-7**] 9:41 AM
Reason: S/P CABG, NOW UNRESPONSIVE, NEURO CHANGES, EVAL FOR
STROKE, BLEED
FINDINGS: The patient is intubated. There is generalized
cerebral atrophy. There is no intracranial hemorrhage, abnormal
extra-axial fluid collection, mass effect or midline shift. The
ventricles are symmetric, and the cisterns are patent. Minimal
fluid or focal thickening is present in the sphenoid and right
maxillary sinus, possibly related to endotracheal intubation.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2185-9-28**]  7:47:46 PM
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. Borderline low limb lead
voltage. Marked left
axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.
Right
bundle-branch block. Probable underlying inferolateral
myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes consistent with ischemia, etc. No
previous
tracing available for comparison. Clinical correlation is
suggested.

FINAL REPORT


INDICATIONS: 84-year-old man with coronary artery disease status
post
coronary artery bypass graft surgery with rising creatinine,
lactate, and
leukocytosis.

COMPARISONS: [**2185-10-28**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT images of the abdomen and
pelvis were
obtained with oral contrast, and sagittal and coronal
reconstructions were
also performed.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases show a few
patchy
ground-glass opacities, which may represent pulmonary venous
congestion. There
is a nasogastric tube in the stomach, and a left-sided chest
tube. There are
smaller, but persistent, bilateral pleural effusions. There is
also a tiny
pneumothorax on the left.

There is new ascites surrounding the liver. The gallbladder is
distended,
with pericholecystic fluid seen. The wall cannot be seen on this
non-contrast
study. The liver is unremarkable. The pancreas, adrenal glands,
and spleen
are within normal limits. There are unchanged bilateral renal
cysts. The left
kidney again demonstrates an atrophic appearance, compared to
the right side.
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or
free air.

The stomach and small bowel are within normal limits. Again
noted is
thickening of the splenic flexure of the colon and descending
colon and
sigmoid. The distribution of the thickening raises possibility
of ischemic
colitis.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Again noted is a
nonobstructing right-sided inguinal hernia. There is a Foley
catheter in the
bladder. The sigmoid demonstrates wall thickening with slight
stranding. The
aorta and iliac vessels are calcified. There is no pelvic or
inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: Again noted are marked degenerative changes of the
lumbar
spine, but no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. New gallbladder distention and pericholecystic fluid, as well
as
perihepatic ascites. These findings are suspicious for
acalculous
cholecystitis in this clinical setting, but correlation with
clinical factors
and an ultrasound, if clinically indicated, is advised.

2. Colitis of the descending and sigmoid colon. This
