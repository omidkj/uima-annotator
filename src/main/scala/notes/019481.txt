ADDENDUM:  This is a discharge summary addendum from previous
discharge summary up until [**4-27**].  This discharge summary
addendum is from [**2151-4-27**] to [**2151-4-30**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pneumonia/sepsis:  The patient had one positive blood
   culture with strep pneumonia treated with Ceftriaxone four
   a two week course, which was discontinued on [**2151-4-29**].
   The course of pneumonia and sepsis are dictated in
   previous discharge summaries.  The patient has remained
   afebrile with stable O2 sats on 3 to 4 liters nasal
   cannula.  She had no leukocytosis.

1. Question of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The
   patient has not had formal pulmonary function tests
   performed, but she likely does have a diagnosis of chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease given that she had
   difficulty weaning from the lead ventilator with auto PEEP
   and increased peak inspiratory pressures that improved
   with steroids and nebulizes.  She was continued on a
   steroid taper and should continue with this as an
   outpatient. She is currently on a dose of 30 mg of
   Prednisone a day and should be tapered as directed to 20
   mg po q day times two days and then 10 mg po q day times
   two days and then off.  The patient should also continue
   with frequent nebulizer treatments standing q four hours
   of Albuterol and Atrovent and likely before discharge may
   want to be transitioned to inhalers.

1. Hypertension:  Has been well controlled.  Continue with
   the Lisinopril and Atenolol q day.

1. Acidosis:  Has resolved.  The patient's lytes and acid
   base balance are stable.

1. Delirium and agitation:  The patient was manifesting some
   episodes of delerium and agitation while in the Intensive
   Care Unit.  This was thought to be secondary to steroid
   therapy.  When the patient tapers off her steroid taper
   she should have her Haldol standing doses tapered as well.
   She will not likely need continued doses of Haldol and
   this should be tapered as soon as her steroids are
   finished in order to prevent QT prolongation.  The patient
   has a QT of 400 and his has bene stable with repeated
   electrocardiograms.  The patient has not required a one to
   one sitter for several days and has not manifested any
   signs of agitation.  As the standing Haldol was titrated
   off the patient should likely have her outpatient
   psychiatric medications started back as an outpatient.
   This can be done by her primary care physician.

1. Nutrition:  The patient has been tolerating a cardiac diet
   and good po.

1. Access:  The patient has a right PICC line placed for
   access.

1. Social support:  The patient has very poor social support
   and she has no source of family or friends except one
   niece.  The patient's niece would like to serve as the
   [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, although the patient herself
   does not agree with this at this time.  With future
   decisions related to the patient's care it would be
   appropriate to call the patient's niece.  Her name is
   [**Name (NI) 553**] [**Name (NI) 21822**].  Home phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21823**], work
   number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) **], cell phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 21824**].
