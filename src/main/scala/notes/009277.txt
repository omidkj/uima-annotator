Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
HCV cirrhosis, upper GI bleed, cerebral edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left IJ Central line
R arterial line
mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
49 y.o. female with Hep C/ETOH cirrhosis, who presented to [**Hospital **] [**2180-12-14**] with hematemesis.  Endoscopy revealed
bleeding esophageal varices which were banded x 3 but she
continued to bleed and required a repeat endoscopy the following
day with three more bands placed to achieve hemostasis.  At
least 1 liter of blood suctioned out of the stomach.  She was
placed on prophylactic levofloxacin on day #1. She was
hypotensive, and was rescuscitated with a total of 13 units
PRBCs, 20 units PLTs, and 12 units FFP.  She remained
hypotensive and required pressor (levophed).  She was intubated
on hospital day #1 for airway protection.  Initially, she
remained unresponsive off sedation, presumed due to hepatic
encephalopathy.  She received lactulose and rifaxamin.  Over the
next couple days, she stabilized hemodynamically and was weaned
off pressor.  On [**2180-12-19**] she had a tonic clonic seizure and
received ativan.  CT head revealed large areas of brain edema in
the parietal and temporal lobes.  Neurology was consulted and
she received one dose of mannitol.  Her serum osm was 314.  She
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Of note, on the AM of transfer, she bit her ET tube when
sedation was lightened and required paralytic to place a bite
guard.  Also, just prior to transfer, sputum culture from [**2180-12-18**]
grew MRSA and she was begun on vancomycin.

including marijuana, hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin (all last
used in early 20s), as well as prescription narcotics (last in
[**2-15**]), and tobacco. Max was 2 pack/day, though now ~[**10-2**]
cigarettes/day. Started smoking at age 14.

Initial CXR, portable [**2180-12-21**]:
PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
The endotracheal tube is 2 cm from the carina, recommend pulling
back between 2 and 3 cm. A nasogastric tube  terminates
overlying the mid stomach with side port well beyond the GE
junction. A right subclavian catheter terminates over the mid
SVC. The lung volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. There is  consolidation of the left base either
representing atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is a likely small
associated left pleural effusion
.
CT head [**2180-12-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral temporal lobe edema with effacement of the
subjacent
temporal horns of the lateral ventricle temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
lateral
ventricles. There appears to be extension of edema into the left
parietal
region with mild sulcal effacement. Images from outside hospital
would be
useful to assess for interval change.
ATTENDING NOTE: I think that the white matter hypodensity
involves both
cerebral hemispheres with predominent involvement of temporal
lobes.
Conditions such herpres encephgalitis should be considered in
the differential but extensive involvement of frontal and
parietal lobes is somewhat unusual. MRI can help for firther
assessment.
.
Abd u/s w/doppler [**2180-12-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.
2. Ascites. A mark was made at the left lower quadrant for
paracentesis to
be performed by the clinical staff.
3. Small right pleural effusion.
4. Splenomegaly.
.
EEG [**2180-12-22**]:
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one electrographic seizure
with
onset in the left temporal region, which then spread to both
hemispheres
and lasted for about two minutes. The background activity in
wakefulness
showed bursts of generalized slowing and occasional left
posterior
quadrant slowing.
.
[**12-22**] CT-A Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal CT angiography and CT venography with no vascular
stenosis or
occlusion, and no venous thrombosis.
2. Unchanged diffuse hypodensity throughout white matter tracts
symmetrically involving both temporal, and, to a lesser extent,
frontal lobes. The findings are suggestive of cerebral edema due
to a systemic or metabolic cause, including liver failure or
related metabolic abnormalities.

[**12-24**] EEG
Impression: This 24 hour video EEG telemetry captured no
electrographic
seizures or pushbutton activations. Automated and routine
sampling
demonstrated periods of generalized slowing consistent with an
underlying encephalopathy. Occasional periods of slowing were
seen in
the temporal parietal leads consistent with more focal regions
of
underlying cortical or subcortical dysfunction.
.
[**12-24**] CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged diffuse hypodensity involving the white matter
tracts
predominantly involving the temporal lobe, also involving the
frontal lobes. The differential diagnosis includes cerebral
edema due to the liver failure. Other white matter disease
cannot be excluded. MRI of the head is the best modality for
evaluation of the white matter disease and cerebral edema.
2. No other acute intracranial pathology is identified.
.
[**12-25**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no ongoing seizure activity.
Routine
samplings showed a background suggestive of an encephalopathy
involving
both superficial and deeper structures and additional slowing in
the
left mid-temporal region.
.
[**12-26**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no clinical or
electrographic
seizures. The background activity was slow with additional
bursts of
generalized slowing suggestive of an encephalopathy and with
focal
slowing and sharp and slow wave complexes in the left temporal
and
posteri
