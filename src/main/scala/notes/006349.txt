Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, weakness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14812**] is a 78 yo male with hx of recent PNA, sCHF (EF
15-20%), and CAD s/p CABG and ICD placement who was admitted
from the ED where he presented with persisent dyspnea and cough
despite recent treatment for PNA.  He had a recent admission
from [**Date range (1) 14813**] for PNA.  He was treated with a 5 day course of
levofloxacin.  His hospital course was complicated by acute
renal failure and bacterial conjunctivitis.  Since discharge he
states he has not felt well.  He has continued to have a
productive cough (denies blood in his sputum).  He has also felt
feverish.  He admits to general weakness.  He also reports
decreased po intake over the past couple days due to decreased
appetite.

Of note he had two car accidents in the last day and was
evaluated afterwards in the ED.

In the ED, intial VS: T 98.1  BP 143/92  HR 68  RR 22  Sat 98%
on RA.  He was found to have a worsening RLL PNA on CXR and
given cefepime and vancomycin.  Per report from the ED, halfway
through the vancomycin infusion he developed acute dypsnea and
tachypnea, redness on his arm where the vanc was infusing, and
tachycardia.  He was placed on a NRB and treated with nebs.  The
infusion was stopped and an EKG was performed which showed ST
elevation V2-V4, TWI V5, V6 (different from his initial EKG).
Cardiology was consulted who looked at his older EKGs and think
the ST changes seen were consistent with his older EKGs (he has
an aneurysm).  Labs and CXR were rechecked without much
difference from his inital workup.  It was concluded that the
reaction likely wasn't from vanc and the rest of the vancomycin
was infused.  He was admitted to the ICU instead of the floor
because of some concern that he was having an allergic reaction
to the vanc. Right before he left the ED he spiked and was given
tylenol.

On ROS he denies HA, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, blood in his stool, or
other symptoms.

On arrival to the MICU he was quickly weaned off the NRB to 4 l
NC.  He denied any chest pain or acute reaction to the
vancomycin in the ED.

Imaging:
CXR: RLL infiltrate

CXR PA/LAT DECUB [**2-12**]:
Three views including a right lateral decubitus view. Comparison
with the
previous study done [**2134-2-12**]. There is continued evidence of
pulmonary
vascular congestion and interstitial infiltrates, consistent
with mild edema.  Heart is enlarged and the patient is status
post median sternotomy as before.  There is a small right
pleural effusion. There is slight redistribution of pleural
fluid on the lateral decubitus view. An ICD remains in place.

IMPRESSION: Small amount of free flow of right pleural fluid.

CXR PA/LAT DECUB [**2-15**]:
The size of the right pleural effusion has increased somewhat
since
the prior decubitus film of [**2-12**]. A small-to-moderate
sized right
pleural effusion is now present.

No other changes are noted.

IMPRESSION: Increased size of right effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo male with hx of recent PNA, sCHF (EF 15-20%), and CAD s/p
CABG and ICD placement here with persisent PNA and possible
allergic reaction to vancomycin.
.
#  Dyspnea/PNA:  The patient was treated with a 5 day course of
levofloxacin recently without much clinical improvement.  His
CXR shows a RLL infiltrate.  There was no CXR from his previous
admission to compare it to (the PNA was diagnosed on an abd CT).
 During his previous admission he was legionella antigen
negative.  White count not elevated (although it was elevated on
admission during his last hospitalization).  PNA may be
persisent partially treated PNA versus resistant PNA.  In [**Name (NI) **], pt
was on vancomycin, however was dc'ed for quesitonable allergic
reaction and low likelihood for MRSA PNA.  Then was on cefepime
and levofloxacin, however was switched to azithromycin and
ceftriaxone considering this PNA is likely continued CAP from
previous admission.  He was also found to have non-loculated
pleural effusion in RLL, which was evaluated by IP, however was
not drained considering appeared clinically much better on
ceftriaxone/azithromycin, so was lses likely to be an empyema or
infectious process.  Bcx with no growth, was weaned off O2 prior
to discharge, satting high 90s on RA, afebrile for >48 hrs prior
to discharge.  Transitioned to cefpodoxime with which he was
discharged for a total 10 day course.
.
#Pleural effusion:  Had non-loculated pleural effusion as above,
initially was evaluated by IP for potential drainage considering
patient continued to be febrile with no symptomatic improvement
after discharge before, however INR was supratherapeutic.  As
INR drifted down, clinically improved and was afebrile so
thoracentesis was deferred.  Pleural effusion thought more
likely to be due to chronic sCHF and so patient was started on
lasix 20 mg PO every other day.  Would check Cr as outpatient to
evaluate renal function while on furosemide and evaluate volume
status for continued need for diuresis.
.
#  ? Reaction to vancomycin:  The patient was described as
developing acute dyspnea, redness around the infusion site, and
also developed a fever after the vanc infusion.  Not a typical
vanc infusion reaction or allergic reaction, but concerning so
vancomycin was held and was added to allergy list.
.
#  Hyponatremia:  Na of 131 on admission with history of poor po
intake.  Likely hypovolemic hyponatremia, which he had had in
the past.  Has EF of 15-20%.  Received IVF in ED, however held
off while on floor due to concern for his chronic sCHF, PO
intake was encouraged.
.
#  Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR was 6.3 on admission,
then elevated to 8.2. He has a history of LV aneurysm and
