Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 72 yo M with PMH of CAD and h/o CABG, CHF (EF 55% in [**10-3**]),
hx of AS/AI, CKD (baseline Cr 1.6), COPD and atrial fibrillation
(on coumadin) here for push enteroscopy/ colonoscopy for
evaluation of GI bleed. Procedure today went smoothly and was
notable for multiple small AVMs s/p thermal ablation. Patient
received ~1100cc of NS during the procedure and propafol
sedation. While in the recover area, he was getting ready to go
home 2 hrs post procedure, when he developed productive cough
and later respiratory distress. At that time he was given 40mg
lasix, 4mg zofran, 25mg demerol (for shaking) and 5mg lopressor
for tachycardia, rate 120s. A code blue was called and he was
intubated and transiently lost a pulse. One round of CPR was
performed with 1 mg of epinephrine. Intubation was notable for
bloody secretions at this time. He also had a tachyarrhythmia to
the epinephrine which lasted only a short time. He never lost a
pulse again and he maintained his blood pressure and was
transferred to the ICU for further care.

[**6-24**] CXR As compared to the previous radiograph, the
retrocardiac atelectasis has slightly increased. The left-sided
parenchymal opacity is unchanged in extent, the pre-existing air
bronchograms are less appreciable than before. The extent of
interstitial fluid accumulation at the right lung base seems to
increase, as expressed by subtle thickening of the peribronchial
interstitium. Minimal left-sided pleural effusion, no newly
occurred focal parenchymal opacities. The size of the cardiac
silhouette is unchanged.

Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with significantly depressed free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
