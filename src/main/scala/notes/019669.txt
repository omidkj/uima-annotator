Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yo F with hx of renal caliculi and s/p
lithotripsy with subsequent urosepsis and ICU admission in [**Month (only) **]
[**2124**].  She re-presents with a similar episode from the PACU s/p
lithotripsy with hypotension of sys bp to 50's in recovery.  Two
days prior to the procedure, the patient had a urine cx showing
ESBL E. coli.  She was started on nitrofurantoin that day and on
the day of her surgery 2 days later she received a pre-operative
dose of gentamicin 250mg in addition to the nitrofurantion she
was on.  The procedure was unremarkable and the patient was
stable and extubated when she left the OR.  In the PACU, the
patient c/o chills and subsequently her systolic bp dropped to
the 50's and spike a fever to 102. She was fluid bolused with a
total of 3L and received levofed 0.06mg/min. She was also given
1 dose of Zosyn 2.25g IV before coming to the unit. She arrived
in the unit and was bolused an additional 2L and the levafed
dose was increased to 0.6mg/min.  The patient c/o back pain and
headache on arrival and denied chest pain or SOB.

The patient had a similar episode in [**2125-10-25**] when she
underwent the same procedure for renal calculi.  At that time,
she became hypotensive post-operatively and was admitted to the
ICU for suspected urosepsis.  While in the unit, she developed
moderate pulmonary edema following aggressive fluid
recusitation.

63 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
line placement
PROCEDURE: Chest portable for line placement on [**2126-1-22**], at 21:31.

COMPARISON: [**2126-1-22**], at 19:14.

HISTORY: Evaluate for line placement.

FINDINGS: In the interim, a new right subclavian central line
has been placed with distal tip projected over the proximal SVC.
Mild cardiomegaly with clear lungs. No pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post placement of a right subclavian central line with
distal tip projected over the proximal SVC. No acute
cardiopulmonary process is seen.

Chest portable AP on [**2126-1-23**] at 5:23.

COMPARISON: [**2126-1-22**] at 21:20.

HISTORY: 63-year-old female with hypotension likely sepsis,
evaluate for edema, infiltrate, effusion.

FINDINGS: In the interim, there is a newly developing left
retrocardiac opacity and right lower lobe opacity likely
atelectasis and/or aspiration. In addition, there is increase in
haziness around the left perihilar region indicating a newly
developing atelectasis and/or aspiration. There is slight
indistinctness and thickening of the interstitial and
intervascular pulmonary tree indicating coexistent pulmonary
edema and/or pneumonia. There is no change in the status of the
right subclavian line which terminates in the proximal SVC. No
change in the status of the pacemaker.

IMPRESSION:

1) Newly developing bibasilar atelectasis and lingular
atelectasis likely aspiration.

2) Acute interstitial edema which could either be secondary to
underlying [**Last Name **] problem or an infectious process. Clinical
correlation is recommended.

ECHO:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%) There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-11-7**],
the RV chamber size may be slightly smaller (not as well
visualized as in the prior study). The degree of TR and
pulmonary hypertension detected are slightly less.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are large
bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis in the lower lobes
and right middle lobe. A calcified granuloma is seen in the
right upper lobe (2:36). The heart and pericardium appear within
normal limits. A pacemaker with dual electrodes is present. The
central airways appear patent. The esophagus is mildly
distended.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple
subcentimeter hypodensities are seen in the right and left lobes
of the liver measuring up to 9 mm in diameter and too small to
accurately characterize. An irregular hypodensity adjacent to
the falciform ligament is in a location typical for focal fatty
infiltration. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder is
nondistended. There is no biliary dilation. The pancreas,
spleen, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.

An internal ureteral stent is present on the right with its
proximal pigtail coiled in the renal pelvis and distal loop
coiled within the bladder. There is urothelial enhancement and
thickening within the right renal pelvis and proximal ureter
(2:72), and periureteral stranding. Heterogeneity of the
nephrogram is present on the right with multiple cortical areas
of hypoenhancement. There is additional cortical thinning in the
upper pole. No definite calcified stones are identified in the
proximal right ureter although a few calcified-appearing foci in
interpolar region calix (2:71), nonspecific due to the presence
of excreted contrast, could represent stone fragments. The left
kidney shows parapelvic cysts and a couple of tiny hypodense
lesions, too small to characterize, but appears otherwise
unremarkable. The large and small bowel loops are normal in
caliber. Moderate amount of ascites is present.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder contains
a Foley catheter and the distal end of the right ureteral stent.
A punctate calcification at the ureteral orifice on the right
within the coil of the stent (2:114) likely represents a stone
fragment. The distal left ureter, uterus and adnexa, rectum and
sigmoid colon appear unremarkable. There is a moderate amount of
ascites in the pelvis. There are no pathologically enlarged
[**Year (4 digits) **] or inguinal lymph nodes.

Diffuse stranding is seen throughout the subcutaneous tissues
consistent with anasarca. An unusual paired linear density
located around the greater curvature of the stomach (2:83)
suggests a track of a previously present catheter or other
manmade structure, and is of uncertain significance.
Alternatively, this could represent paired venous structures
with an unusual appearance.

BONE WINDOWS: No lesions worrisome for osseous
