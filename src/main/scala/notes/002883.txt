[**11-10**] CT abd pelvis (wet read): Area of circumferential
wall thickening of the proximal ascending colon, concerning for
malignancy. Abutting the abnormal colon is a large abscess
extending through the right lower anterior abdominal wall
measuring 11.8 (trv) x 11.3 (CC) x 9.2 cm (AP), presumably
caused
by perforation of the colon.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ACS surgery service on [**2138-11-11**]
and had a exlap, washout, R colectomy, CCY. The patient
tolerated the procedure well.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received fentanyl IV. Once
extubated she was switched to a dilaudid PCA, with good effect
and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the
patient was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained intubated on the night of POD 0,
she was successfully extubated on POD 1. The patient was stable
from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely
monitored.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced once bowel
function had returned. Foley was removed on POD#1. Intake and
output were closely monitored.

ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV vancomycin
and zosyn.  She may continue on vancomycin and zosyn until she
is seen in [**Hospital 2536**] clinic. The patient's temperature was closely
watched for signs of infection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on POD 6, the patient was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled.  Her pathology report returned a diagnosis of
colonic adenocarcinoma, pT3N2Mx, hence her discharge diagnosis
is perforated colonic adenocarcinoma.

Extended Care

Facility:

Abdominal wound debridement and washout with VAC placement

Discharge Condition:
At the time of discharge the patient was able to ambulate.  She

Discharge Instructions:
You will go to an acute inpatient rehabilitation facility where
you will have VAC dressing changes to your abdominal wound every
three days.  Additionally you will have ongoing care for your
incision site and your abdominal drain, which will remain in
place until you are seen in clinic.

ACTIVITY:

Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs.
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you

see your [**Location (un) 5059**] at your next visit.
Don't lift more than 20-25 lbs for 6 weeks. (This is about the
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.)
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you
can resume tub baths or swimming.
Heavy exercise may be started after 6 weeks, but use common
sense and go slowly at first.
You may resume sexual activity unless your doctor has told you
otherwise.

HOW YOU [**Month (only) **] FEEL:

nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your
throat during surgery.
You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. You

might feel somewhat depressed.
You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your [**Month (only) 5059**].

YOUR INCISION:
Your incision may be slightly red around the stitches. This is
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. (These are the thin
paper strips that might be on your incision.) But if they fall
off before that that's okay).
It is normal to feel a firm ridge along the incision. This will
go away.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision ar
