Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 83 yo m w/ MDS converting to blast crisis, CHF,
COPD, being treated for MAC infection, admitted w/ [**Hospital 16486**]
transferred to ICU w/ respiratory failure in setting of blood
transfusion, w/ increased opacities on CXR.

1) Resp failure- admitted to ICU ventilated , large A-a
gradient.  Diff dx includes: Transfusion related lung injury vs
acute pulmonary edema vs sepsis.  CVP was high, but poor
response to Lasix, no evidence of high SVR, so cardiogenic shock
felt less likely and story not c/w this diagnosis.  Most likely
was TRALI.  Pt was continued on cefepime and vancomycin for
concern of PNA (w/ pseudomonal coverage).  Pt did not do well
following admission, w/ ongoing hypoxemia and dependence on
ventilator.
.
2) hypotension- unclear etiology, likely [**3-8**] sepsis vs trali.
Pt remains w/ low MAPS so propofol (initial explanation for
hypotension) highly unlikely.  During admission pt req'd at
least two pressers to maintain maps>60.  During this time the
patient continued to be febrile.  Late in hospital course, in
d/w family it was decided that further pressers would not be
added to the patient's regimen.
.
3) MDS- on admission pt was clearly undergoing transformation to
blast crisis.  Hydrea and allopurinol were added to the patients
regimen to attempt to slow progression but WBCC continued to
rise.  On admission to ICU, was 17, on [**12-25**] was 67 w/
differential showing 44% blasts.  Family was significantly
involved in all medical decision making and present at bedside.
On [**12-25**] pt died of complications of AML.

4) ARF: cr essentially double his baseline value on admission to
ICU. Leveled off at approximately 2.5.  Electrolytes c/w
prerenal etiology but pt requiring furosemide to minimize pulm
edema given increased permeability of vessels [**3-8**] lung injur.

5) Hypothyroid- continued on Levoxyl
