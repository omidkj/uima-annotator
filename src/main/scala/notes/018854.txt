Service:  GENERAL SURGERY PURPLE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Esophgeal cancer.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 50214**] is a 48 year-old
man who is generally healthy who presented as an outpatient
with approximately a two month history of epigastric pain.
He was started on a proton pump inhibitor and hospitalized.
At this time he was ruled out for an myocardial infarction
and upper endoscopy actually revealed a tumor in the cardia
of the stomach, which extended into the distal esophagus.  A
biopsy of the tumor revealed a well differentiated
adenocarcinoma.  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an
esophagogastrectomy.  The patient has not described any
dysphagia.  He is able to eat soft foods and liquids without
any trouble, but does report a small amount of solid
dysphagia.  He does report that he ahs had approximately a 20
pound weight loss unintentionally over the past several
months.  He denies fevers, nausea, vomiting or any recent
respiratory illnesses.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  History of cerebrovascular accident with mild residual
left hemiparesis.
3.  Asthma.
4.  History of basal cell carcinoma.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q.d.
2.  Paxil 40 mg po q.d.
3.  Protonix 40 mg po q.d.
4.  Norvasc 10 mg po q.d.
5.  Diovan 320 mg po q.d.
6.  Coumadin 1 mg po q.d. for his cerebrovascular accident.
7.  Oxycodone as needed for pain.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for multiple family members with
carcinoma.  His mother died of breast cancer.  His father
died of lung carcinoma.  Maternal grandfather died of
esophageal cancer and his maternal uncle died of breast
cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well developed man with
obvious recent weight loss.  His head and neck examination is
all within normal limits.  His neck is supple without any
nodes or masses.  His lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen is soft without any distention, tenderness, masses or
organomegaly.  His extremities are without any clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically he is basically intact,
although there is a slight right facial droop.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After reviewing the endoscopic photos and
discussing his options with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the patient opted
for an elective Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy.  He presents
on [**2-29**] for that procedure.  Please refer to the previously
dictated operative note by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from
[**2180-2-29**] for the specifics of this surgery.  In brief, an
Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **] esophagogastrectomy was performed with resection
of the tumor at the junction of the stomach and distal
esophagus.  The specimen was sent for pathology.  Eventually
the pathology returned to show a well differentiated
adenocarcinoma, T1 with no involvement in 13 adjacent lymph
nodes.  There is no lymphatic or venous invasion.  Margins were
all clear. In addition, during this procedure a feeding
jejunostomy was
placed as well as bilateral chest tubes.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the floor
on subcutaneous heparin twice a day and an epidural for his
pain control.  The patient was doing well postoperatively
until postoperative day two.  The patient was noted to have
respiratory distress with markedly decreasing oxygen
saturation, tachypnea, tachycardia and significant confusion.
 In fact he pulled out his nasogastric tube at this point.
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  A arterial
blood gas at this time showed a pH of 7.52, PCO2 of 32, PO2
of 60, bicarb of 27 and a base deficit of 3.  Because of his
significant AA gradient the patient was intubated at this
time.  Workup for the respiratory distress included a CTA of
the chest, which revealed bilateral pulmonary emboli in the
right upper lobe and left lower lobe.  The patient was
started on a heparin drip and was soon having therapeutic
anticoagulation.  On postoperative day three the patient's
nasogastric tube was replaced under fluoroscopy.  His deep
veins in his lower and upper extremities were examined for
thrombotic sources of pulmonary emboli, however, none were
noted on these studies.  His respiratory status improved and
he was extubated.

On the morning of postoperative day four the patient had
again another bout of significant hypoxia with a large AA
gradient.  It was determined that he had a recurrent
pulmonary emboli despite being on therapeutic heparin.  At
this point it was decided that he should have an inferior
vena cava filter placement.  This was placed by the Vascular
Service on postoperative day five and the patient tolerated
the procedure without any complications.  The patient
remained well for the next few days and on postoperative day
nine was reextubated.  At this time he was noted to be at his
goal tube feedings.  On [**3-10**] a swallow study revealed no leak
at the patient's esophagogastric anastomosis.  The patient's
nasogastric tube was discontinued and he was transferred to
the floor from the Intensive Care Unit.  The next day the
patient was started on clears.  In addition he had his chest
tubes removed without complications.  The other remaining
issues while the patient was on the floor revolved around
preparing the patient for home.  Basically his nutritional
status was buffed.  By the time he was being discharged the
patient was on a regular post esophagogastrectomy diet with
six small meals a day.  In addition for nutritional
supplementation he received cycle tube feeds at night.  He
was also put on oral anticoagulation with Coumadin and once
his INR was greater then 2 it was determined that he was able
to go home on oral Coumadin.  His primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 50215**] was consulted and agreed to follow his INR as an
outpatient.  While on the unit he had been placed on
antibiotics for several positive sputum cultures.  These
antibiotics were discontinued prior to discharge and finally
a physical therapy evaluation determined that he was ready to
go home and that he did not need outpatient rehab treatment.

Therefore on [**2180-3-19**], which was postoperative day 19 the
patient was tolerating a regular diet.  He was afebrile for
the last several days and he was properly anticoagulated for
his pneumothorax. He was discharged home in good condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix 40 mg once a day.
2.  Paxil 40 mg once a day.
3.  Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once a day.
4.  Norvasc 10 mg once a day.
5.  Diovan 325 mg once a day.
6.  Coumadin 10 mg once a day.
7.  Atrovent and Albuterol inhalers as needed.
8.  Ambien 10 mg po q.h.s. prn as needed for sleep.
9.  Roxicet one to two teaspoons as needed for pain every
four to six hours.
10.  Replete with fiber tube feeds at 80 cc an hour for 12
hours at night.

He is recommended to have twice weekly laboratory work to
assess his INR with the results forwarded to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 50215**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Esophageal carcinoma status post Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **]
esophagogastrectomy.
2.  Status post feeding jejunostomy tube placement.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Asthma.
5.  History of cerebrovascular accident.
6.  Pulmonary emboli status post inferior vena cava filter
placement.
7.  Pneumonia.
