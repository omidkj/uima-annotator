abdominal pain

History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old woman with atrial fibrillation and end
stage renal disease presenting with epigastric pain and
bradycardia from dialysis suite.  Our patient was at home in her
usual state of health while she developed epigastric pain while
straining during a bowel movement.  She then came into dialyis,
and while in the suite, she was noted to be bradycardic in the
30s and hypotensive in 90s/40s and refered to the ED.  In the ED
he presenting vitals were VS 97.4, HR 30s, 107/61 18, 97% RA.
Her ECG showed second degree AVB and peaked t waves. Her K was
7.0.
Of note she has a history of a similar admission with
hyperkalemia and bradycardia in [**9-28**], which was treated with
dialysis. On arrival to floor, patient states that abdominal
pain has improved.

Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: first diagnosed in [**Month (only) **]
[**2195**]. She has not been on Coumadin until very recently due to
history of upper GI bleeding. On [**Month (only) 404**] of this year, she was
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with chest pain and shortness of breath in the

setting of atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response and
hyperkalemia. She was treated for hyperkalemia and subsequently

her atrial flutter was converted to sinus rhythm. Myocardial
infarction was [**Hospital1 20003**] out based EKG and biomarkers. Thereafter,
she underwent right-sided isthmus ablation of clockwise atrial
flutter, and was started on quinidine and Coumadin.
2. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to IgA
nephropathy. She underwent cadaveric kidney transplant in [**2173**]
which has eventually failed, and started on hemodialysis in
[**2193**].
3. History of upper GI bleeding on [**2195-2-20**] with evidence
of esophagitis, gastric ulcer, and bleeding duodenal vessel. She

was treated by clipping, cauterization and PPI. Repeated
endoscopy in [**2195-4-21**] revealed mild inflammation and healing
ulcer. She has not had any recurrent episodes of GI bleeding
since then.
4. Diastolic heart failure supported by an echocardiography from

[**2195-12-21**]. Clinically, she is stable and fairly asymptomatic

on her current medical regimen.
5. History of malignant hypertension, which was complicated by
seizure on [**2193-5-20**]. Not on antiepileptic meds. Denies h/o CVA.

6. Depression.
7. Rheumatic fever in childhood
.


Social History:
She is single, lives by herself in [**Location (un) 686**], and has no
children. She quit smoking 25 years ago (10-pack-years). She
rarely drinks alcohol, and denies illicit drug use. She used to

work part-time in a coffee shop, but currently does not work.


Family History:
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or

sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory. Her father
died at the age of 80. Her mother died at the age of 64 from
lung CA. She has a sister with breast CA. MI in uncle in his 60s

CXR:  No active pulmonary disease.

EKG:Sinus bradycardia with pauses and junctional escape beats.
Possible blocked premature atrial contractions. Also, evidence
for retrograde conduction in lead V1. Tall T waves suggesting
hyperkalemia. Probable anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2196-10-4**] sinus bradycardia,
first degree A-V block, junctional beats and tall peaked T waves
are new.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 year old woman with atrial fibrillation and end stage renal
disease status post failed transplant and currently on HD who
presented with epigastric pain, hyperkalemia, and sinus
bradycardia.
 .
# Hyperkalemia: Secondary to ESRD. She has a history of
hyperkalemic episodes in the past, that required MICU admission
and emergent dialysis. Her baseline K is in the 5-6 range. K was
7.6 at admission and EKG showed peaked T waves and first-second
degree AV block with junctional escape rhythm. She received
calcium gluconate, bicarb and 10 units insulin in the ED. She
was urgently dialyzed and K came down to 4.0. K increased
gradually over following 24 hours and requiring 2 hours HD prior
to discharge. This was due to diet in the setting of oliguria,
and less likely due to ACEi. Patient was taking both captopril
and lisinopril at home. She will be discharged on lisinopril at
half her prior dose.
.
# Bradycardia: Sinus bradycardia with 1st degree AV delay with
junctional escape beats. The most likely cause was beta-blocker
toxicity in setting of worsening CRI. Metoprolol was D/Ced. TSH
was WNL.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Pt in sinus rhythm. Continued amiodarone
and warfarin. INR at D/C was 1.9, which was trending up from 1.4
on home dose of 4 mg warfarin daily. This dose was continued and
she will f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic.
.
# Epigastric pain: Ddx included anginal equivalent/CAD vs viral
gastroenteritis vs renal failure vs gastritis. Troponins were
flat at prior baseline 0.05-0.07. EKG with no ischemic changes.
No diarrhea. Pain improved spontaneously. Continued
pantoprazole.
.
# ESRD on HD: secondary to IgA nephropathy, s/p failed
transplant. Underwent HD on [**12-17**] and [**12-19**].
.
# HTN:  Normotensive. Continued lisinopril at half home dose and
D/Ced captopril. Continued norvasc. D/Ced metoprolol for
toxicity with ESRD that caused bradycardia.
