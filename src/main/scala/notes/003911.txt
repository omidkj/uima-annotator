History of Present Illness:
84F h/o MI in [**2086**] and CVA [**2099**], on Coumadin FOR AFIB, denies
CABG or stents, c/o 1 hr of chest tightness, nausea,
diaphoresis, onset while at rest watching TV. Followed by Mark
[**Doctor Last Name **] at [**Location (un) **]. In ED had inferior STEMI with 2>3 STE in
inferior leads. She got ASA and a Heparin bolus. INR was >3 so
no gtt started. She was not given plavix prior to procedure.

She was taken to the cath lab where she was found to have
90-100% mid RCA occlusion. The wire was delpoyed across the
lesion but due to her INR of >3 and fragile appearing [**Last Name (un) 12599**]
she was not felt to be a canditate for stenting. She underwent
baloon angioplasty.

STUDIES:
ECG ([**3-31**]):
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Inferior ST segment
elevation
consistent with an acute inferior myocardial infarction and
probable lateral extension with slight ST segment elevation in
leads V5-V6. There is reciprocal ST segment depression in leads
I, aVL and V1-V2. No previous tracing available for comparison.


Cardiac Cath ([**3-31**]):
COMMENTS:
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated one-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD,
and LCx
had minimal disease but were free of angiographically-apparent
flow-limiting stenoses.  The mid-RCA was subtotally occluded.
2) After the mid-RCA angioplasty, she began complaining of
nausea and
dizziness and was noted to have a noninvasive sBP in the high
50s.  The
transducer was connected to the right radial arterial sheath
sidearm,
with blunted pressure recordings.  Noninvasive readings were
consistently below sBP 70.  She was given 2 mg atropine for
presumed
vagal reaction, and started on IV fluids and dopamine, up to 20
mcg/kg/min.  A right common femoral arterial sheath was placed
in
preparation for possible IABP placement.  However, her sBPs were
then
noted to be in the 80s-90s.  At that time, her heart rates were
in the
140s-150s (transiently as high as 200) and appeared to be atrial

fibrillation; she was then given 15mg IV metoprolol with
resulting heart
rates in the 120s and stable sBPs in the 100s.  The RCFA sheath
was
manually pulled and a TR band was applied to the RRA site.  She
was
transported to the CCU in stable condition.
ADDENDUM: PCI COMMENTS:
Initial angiography revealed a subtotally occluded RCA. We
planned to
treat this using PTCA. A 6 Fr JR5 guiding catheter provided
reasonable
support throughout the procedure. Chronic Warfarin therapy with
known
INR of 3.2 48 hours prior. A Prowater wire was successfully
advanced
across the target lesio
