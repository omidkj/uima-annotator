Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Sixty-nine year old female with
history of CAD status post CABG and redo, who presented to
outside hospital yesterday with complaints of chest tightness
and increased shortness of breath.  Pain described as sharp
[**5-1**].  EKG showed left ventricular hypertrophy with atrial
abnormality.  Q waves in III, aVF.  Initial enzymes showed CK
of 69, troponin of 0.88.  Chest x-ray consistent with CHF.
She was given aspirin, Lopressor, IV nitroglycerin, Heparin,
and Integrilin, and transferred to [**Hospital3 **] for emergent
catheterization.

Catheterization revealed a three vessel disease, both SVG to
left circumflex and LAD were patent.  Graft to RCA not
evaluated at that time.  There was a mid LAD hazy lesion just
distal to SVG anastomosis.  Successful angio plus stent with
2.5 x 18 Cypher stent placed.  Patient hypotensive after the
catheterization.  Was taken to CT scanner, which revealed a
right sided retroperitoneal bleed.  At that point, patient
was transferred to CCU for further observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post three vessel CABG in
[**2111**].  SVG to RCA, left circumflex, plus LAD redone in [**2118**].
2. Hypertension.
3. Hyperlipidemia.
4. Spastic colon.
5. Diverticulosis.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. CHF:  EF 35%.  Also ischemic cardiomyopathy.
8. Peripheral vascular disease.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1. Atenolol 100 q.a.m., 50 q.p.m.
2. Synthroid.
3. Aspirin 325 q.d.
4. Zestril 20 q.d.
5. Clonidine 0.2 q.d.
6. Calcium.
7. Multivitamins.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Quit tobacco six years ago.  Lives with
husband.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cells 19.5,
hematocrit 32.3, which was then 30.0, platelets 399.  Sodium
141, potassium 4.2, chloride 108, bicarb 22, BUN 18,
creatinine 0.8, magnesium 1.7, calcium 8.6.

CT of the abdomen:  Wet read showed two aortic aneurysms less
than 4 cm.  A large right sided retroperitoneal bleed.

Echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of
35%, inferoposterior plus basal septal akinesis, trace MR.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Heart rate was 100, afebrile.  Generally, she
was frail appearing female, slightly older than stated age
alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  PERRLA.  No
lymphadenopathy.  No JVD.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, S1,
S2 normal, holosystolic [**1-25**] murmur radiates to the axilla.
PMI not displaced.  Pulmonary at the time was not examined.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Groin:  Right groin with well marked hematoma, no
oozing, and no bruit.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 79-year-old female with
significant CAD, was transferred to CCU after catheterization
laboratory following stent placement in the mid LAD
complicated by retroperitoneal bleed.

For cardio status, status post CAD, she was continued on
aspirin, Plavix, beta blocker, and ACE.  Also a statin was
added to her regimen.  Her Integrilin was stopped secondary
to retroperitoneal bleed, and was eventually stopped when she
was in the hospital.  She did well and after day two, and was
transferred to the floor and doing well on the floor with
slight episodes of tachycardia.

For rhythm, she was monitored on telemetry with couple
episodes of sinus tachycardia.  The day before discharge, she
was tachycardic in the 110s-120s requiring two 5 mg IV
Lopressor x2, which did well, but brought the patient's
tachycardia back down and she was sinus in 80s.  Since
continuing on beta blocker, I have actually increased beta
blockers since she was admitted.

Valve:  Echocardiogram showed mitral regurgitation.

CHF:  She had an EF of 35% in [**2125-4-22**].  Still continued
beta blocker at the dose recommended, increasing it for
rhythm.  Also continued an ACE for afterload reduction.

In terms of her heme status, she was typed and crossed for 2
units secondary to retroperitoneal bleed, which her
peritoneal bleed has been stable since, and on the day of
discharge, she had a right sided groin ultrasound for the
bruit to evaluate.  She had pedal pulses bilaterally, and was
able to ambulate without any difficulty on the day of
discharge.  Her hematocrit was stable on the day of
discharge, and had been about in the low 30s for the past
several days.

She received 1 unit of blood while she was admitted on this
admission, and since then, her hematocrit had actually stayed
stable.  She also received an echocardiogram to re-evaluate
her EF postcatheterization on the day of discharge, and
results are pending.

In terms of her endocrine, her TSH was 1.1 as well, and she
was continued on her Synthroid as recommended.  She tolerated
her diet well, low sodium diet 2 grams/day.

She was discharged in very stable condition with instructions
to followup or return to clinic if symptoms return or new
symptoms arise.  She was discharged to home.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Status post mid left anterior descending
artery stent.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOWUP:  Follow up with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 20261**]
next week.  Call for an appointment with Dr. .............

MAJOR SURGICAL/INVASIVE PROCEDURES DONE:  She had a Cypher
stent placed in mid left anterior descending artery.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 enteric coated q.d.
2. Plavix 75 mg q.d.
3. Levothyroxine 100 mcg q.d.
4. Atorvastatin 10 mg q.d.
5. Metoprolol 50 mg 1.5 tablets or equivalent to 75 mg b.i.d.
6. Lisinopril 20 mg q.d.

FOLLOWUP:  As discussed above.
