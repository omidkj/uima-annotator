Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea/Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Otherwise healthy 29F, no sig PMH, history of smoking, developed
dyspnea and cough 3 days ago, and went to [**Hospital3 4107**], where
she was diagnosed with anxiety and a RML pneumonia on CXR and
discharged on azithromycin. Pt states that her coughing has
gotten worse over the past 3 days, and so she returned to the
[**Hospital1 **] ER, where she was found to be dyspneic with an O2 sat in
the low 80s. Pt had "low-grade" temp to 100F, with chills and
body aches. Pt had no n/v/d, no sputum production. Pt did feel a
subjective wheezing sensation. Pt was placed on BiPap, with
improvement in O2 sat to high 90s. A CXR revealed worsening
Right middle lobe infiltrate from prior study, with a
questionable LLL infiltrate as well. ABG revealed PaO2 63. Pt
received Azithro, ceftriazone, nebs, magnesium, solumedrol for
wheezing and ?asthma exacerbation, as well as a heparin bolus
and gtt. Given pt's hypoxia, pt was given a CTPE to r/o PE in
addition to pneumonia. This was read by [**Hospital1 39933**] radiologists as
showing b/l PEs, in addition to b/l multifocal pneumonia. Pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.9 ??????F (37.2 ??????C), Pulse: 94, RR:
25, BP: 126/74, O2Sat: 91, O2Flow: 5. PT was given Tamiflu for
concern for influenza, and the CT study was sent to radiology
for a 2nd read. She was taken off bipap here and subsequently
she satted 88% on 4L NC with RR 40s. She was switched to
non-rebreather with RR high 30s, and then placed on BIPAP with
RR 20s, FiO2 60, with O2 Sat high 90s. ABG was performed on
BiPap with PaO2 86. Pt had a persistent air leak on bipap mask,
and required multiple mask revisions. An informal bedside echo
in the ED revealed no RV strain, and her EKG revealed no R heart
strain. A Trop and BNP are pending (sent for prognosis of PE).
PT has a Flu swab, blood cx at [**Hospital3 4107**] none here.
Access:20 g and 18g
IVF: 1L at OSH, nothing here
Vitals: afebrile, HR 103, BP 120-130/82, RR 25 on BIPAP satting
95%.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  pt is comfortable, satting 90% on 4L
NC. She was conversational but breathing quickly, and complained
of continuing dry cough and anxiety. PT also complained of a
wheezing sensation, but otherwise stated that she felt "well."

IMAGING:

CT CHEST ([**2132-1-31**]):
1. Multifocal ground-glass opacities, worse in the upper zones,
most
compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Hemorrhage can have a
similar
appearance. Please correlate with symptoms.
2. The examination is suboptimal for assessment of pulmonary
emboli to the
subsegmental levels, No large PE is detected. If there remains a
high clinical concern for small emboli, a repeat CTA could be
considered.

CXR ([**2132-2-1**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**1-31**]. Many small foci of
consolidation and ground-glass opacification, most prominent
around both hila have not changed since [**1-31**] consistent with
a multifocal, probably non-bacterial pneumonia. Heart size is
normal. Pleural effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax.
Normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes.


Brief Hospital Course:
29 yo F smoker with no other significant PMHx presents with dry
cough and worsening dyspnea over 3 days, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
BiPap for hypoxia with chest CT showing multifocal pneumonia.
Admitted initially to the MICU for hypoxia, weaned down the
nasal cannula and transferred to the medicine floor the
following morning.

ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
# Multifocal pneumonia:  CTA chest from [**Hospital1 **] showed multifocal
pneumonia and possible pulmonary embolisms, so patient arrived
on heparin gtt.  Upon re-read of CTA by [**Hospital1 18**] attending
radiologist, no pulmonary embolism was seen, so she was taken
off the heparin gtt.  She was weaned off BiPAP shortly after
admission to the MICU, stabilized 4-6 L NC.  Given diffuse
wheezing on exam, prednisone 40mg was started as well as
cef
