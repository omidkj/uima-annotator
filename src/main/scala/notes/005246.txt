History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86278**] is a 82F with COPD on home O2, anxiety, HTN, and prior
CAD with previous anatomy unknown who presented to an OSH with
SOB and chest pain. Initially presented to [**Hospital3 3583**] on
[**2105-3-14**] with chest pain and brown sputum. CTA was done that
reportedly showed no PE, and patient ruled out by biomarkers.
Patient was discharged to her nursing home, but returned to
[**Hospital1 46**] 3-4 days ago c/o increasing chest pain and dyspnea, as
well as hemoptysis. This was treated with cefuroxime and patient
reportedly had resolution of her hemoptysis at that time. On
[**2105-4-6**] patient returned to OSH with chest pain and increased
dyspnea requiring BiPap.

At OSH, thought to have RUL pna and started on
pip/tazo/vancomycin/levaquin. Placed on BiPAP and initially in
the ICU. Developed CP this morning with setting of tachycardia
to 120s, EKG reportedly showed lateral ST depressions. Labs
notable for tropn 0.36->16.3, CK 26->516. She was given ASA,
plavix 600mg, nitro and started on heparin and nitro drips. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.

In cath lab, patient found to have 2vd with DES placed in LCx,
and BMS in RCA with difficulty passing wire.  Her cath was
complicated by dissection of the RCA. Three BMS placed in region
of dissection with good angiographic result. Patient started on
dopamine in the lab. Atropine given for hypotension/bradycardia.
Dopamine weaned to off.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient was in marked respiratory
distress. Breath sounds were notable for diffuse wheezing and
ronchi, and she was tacypneic in the high 20's with belly
breathing. Placed on 100% NRB with O2 sat's in low 90's and ABG
revealed significant acidosis. She was given nebs, 40mg IV
lasix, and morphine on arrival.  Ultimately, she required
intubation after failure to improve with medical therapy.

Further ROS could not be obtained as patient intubated.

Cardiac Cath
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful placement of DES to LCx.
3. Successful placement of BMS x 3 to RCA.
4. Successful angioseal of right femoral access site.

CXR ([**2105-4-7**]) - FINDINGS: No previous images. The cardiac
silhouette is enlarged and there is fullness of pulmonary
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Opacification at the right base could reflect pleural effusion
and underlying consolidation or atelectasis. Opacification in
the right upper zone is strongly suggestive of pneumonia. A
prominence of the right hilar region raises the possibility of a
[**Location (un) 21851**] with post-obstructive consolidation.
Some opacification at the left base is also consistent with
atelectasis or
consolidation.

CXR ([**2105-4-10**]) - IMPRESSION:
Improvement in pulmonary hemorrhage. Worsening of left lower
lobe atelectasis.

CT Chest - IMPRESSION:
1. Probable active pulmonary hemorrhage.
2. Chronic, exudative or slightly hemorrhagic pleural effusions,
and reactive adenopathy.
3. Mild subglottic tracheal narrowing and bibasilar
bronchomalacia.
4. Nodular enlarged thyroid gland.
5. Coronary, aortic vascular calcifications.

Echo - The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is very mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basl to mid
infero-lateral hypokinesis. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed
jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (?
Papillary muscle dysfunction?). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CT Head - IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process. Note that CT has limited
sensitivity for
the detection of acute infarction and MR can be considered as
clinically
indicated.
2. Mucosal thickening and air-fluid level seen involving the
paranasal
sinuses. Recommend clinical correlation for pansinusitis.
3. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Repiratory distress: Likley multifactorial, due to pre-existing
COPD
