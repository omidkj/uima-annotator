Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, abdominal distension, drainage from GJ tube site

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Interventional Radiology placement of G-J tube

History of Present Illness:
(All hx from chart as pt aphasic and unable to discuss with
family members. 69 y/o F w/ a h/o pansensitive TB on 3 drug
regimen, MDS with pancytopenia, respiratory failure s/p trach
placement and revision [**5-/2147**], recently admitted [**Date range (1) 102694**] with
sepsis presumed [**12-23**] PNA (by MDR E coli, pseudomonas) who comes
in from [**Hospital3 **] with increasing abdominal distension,
drainage from GJ tube site and fever. On last admission pts
sputum grew out pan sensitive serratia and two strains of
psudomonas. 3 wk course of inhaled tobramycin and ciprofloxacin.
completed [**8-11**]. ARF, UTI complicated course. Two days ago the
patient's G-tube fell out and she had it was replaced.
Presented today with a firm distended abdomen, fever to 100.8
and GJ site draining copious amounts of green yellow fluid.
Lowest BP noted at 90/53. Given vancomycin and ceftaz. Attempted
subclavian, unsuccesful. Of note plts at 14. Large amounts of
blood from trach site, requiring frequent suction. 2 L NS also
given. Pt sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 102695**] 90/40. Temp to 100.5. Started on meropenem and
ceftaz as per ID. Fluid bolus given. Blood cx, coags, chem 7, UA
and cx ordered. 2 bags platelets given.
.
Recent ID course:
Prior cultures significant for MDR pseudomonas sensitive to
Cipro from sputum [**6-10**] and MDR E coli sensitive (ESBL) to
Meropenem from sputum [**6-9**]. Also, VRE from cath tip on [**6-21**],
started on Daptomycin, however, daptomycin was discontinued due
to negative blood cx for VRE on [**6-23**]. Tobramycin was added on
[**6-19**] for double coverage of resistent pseudomonas given poor
lung penetration of Cipro. The full course of meropenem was
completed on [**7-2**] and of tobramycin on [**7-3**]. On last
admission, sputum grew out pan sensitive serratia and two
strains of pseudomonas. 3 wk course of inhaled tobramycin and
ciprofloxacin. completed [**8-11**].

KUB [**2147-8-19**] GJ-tube is present, the tip of which is
probably in the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum. There is a
non- specific bowel gas pattern. Heterotopic bone formation is
seen involving the left hip.Degenerative changes in the lower
lumbar spine are again noted.
.
CXR [**2147-8-19**] No pneumothorax is identified. A right-sided
subpulmonic effusion is unchanged. There is bibasilar
atelectasis. A right-sided PICC with the tip in the superior SVC
is unchanged. The tracheostomy tube is unchanged.
.
EKG- Sinus tach 106, low voltages, Q III AVF, T wave flattening

CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fluid and air tracking along the GJ tube site consistent
with known
clinical leak.  No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess or
extraluminal
contrast extravasation.  No evidence of obstruction.
2.  Bibasilar airspace opacity is likely consolidation with
small bilateral
pleural effusions.
3.  Unchanged splenic infarcts of unknown etiology.
4.  Moderate amount of ascites and severe anasarca.
5.  Right renal hemorrhagic cyst.
6.  Foley catheter balloon is inflated within the urethra and
should be
repositioned.
7.  Heterotopic bone formation associated with the left proximal
femur may
relate to myositis ossificans related to prior trauma.  This
heterotopic bone has slowly increased in size and prominence
since [**2147-1-2**], at which time there was an
intramuscular hematoma in this region.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo female with a history of disseminated TB, GJ tube
placement after CVA with recent replacement, Serratia and
Pseudomonas PNA and persistent intermittent fevers presenting
with abdominal distension and fever, increased drainage from
adjacent to GJ tube site and bloody secretions from trach site.

.
#Pseudomonas pneumonia: Chronic low grade fever intermittently
on multiple hospitalizations with unclear etiology. Recent hx of
pneumonia including pseudomonas, serratia - with recent ([**2147-7-23**])
sputum culture showing strain of pseudomonas resistant to
meropenem and cefepime - sensitive only to tobramycin - received
treatment at that time. Now with new fever spike to 102,
increased white sputum production and cough. Subsequent sputum
culture revealed pseudomonas pneumonia with sensitivities
identical to prior hospitalizations.  Was treated with
tobramycin and ciprofloxacin per culture sensitivities.  Mild
improvement, but the day prior to death, had an aspiration event
after vomiting with likely resultant aspiration pneumonitis.
.
#G-J tube dysfunction - Admitted with nonfunctional G-J tubes,
with copious draining from site (stomach secretions). CT scan
negative for abscess or ileus. KUB with no evidence of
pneumoperitoneam. IR replaced the tube.  She continued to have
1.5-2L of fluid output daily via the G-tube.  Additionally, the
J-tube had no drainage, but resultant lab data after medication
administration indicated her small intestine was not absorbing
properly.  She was reimaged on [**2147-8-24**] with increased concern
for an evolving intraabdominal process given worsening abdominal
distension and sepsis.  CT Scan again revealed no
intra-abdominal abscess or fluid collections.  The day she
expired, she again became septic following aspiration
necessitating multiple fluid boluses.  Desp
