Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8487**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from outside hospital for further management of biliary
leak status post cholecystectomy.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
69 year-old female with h/o obesity, afib/flutter, asthma, [**Hospital **]
transferred from OSH [**12-13**] for further management of biliary
leak s/p CCY [**11-19**]. Ms. [**Known lastname 59817**] was initially admitted to
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with confusion and slurred speech.
CT/MRI/MRA of head revealed no acute disease. She also had afib
with RVR and was treated with digoxin, then diltiazem and
lopressor.

During her OSH, she developed lower abdominal pain. A CT
revealed free fluid around the liver, spleen, and pelvis.  She
was afebrile, but with a WMC of 20. Zosyn and Flagyl were
initiated. She was transferred to [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**12-10**],
where an abdominal ultrasound confirmed ascites. A diagnostic
paracentesis was remarkable for bilious fluid. MRCP normal. A
HIDA suggested biliary leak. She was transferred on [**12-13**] to
[**Hospital1 18**] surgery with plan for ERCP.

Past Medical History:
Obesity
Atrial fibrillation/flutter
Hypertension

Asthma
S/P cholecystectomy on [**2129-11-19**]

[**12-14**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The visualized lung
bases demonstrate minor dependent atelectatic changes. There is
a large amount of free fluid within the abdomen with evidence of
cholecystectomy, consistent with the clinical history of biliary
leak. The liver, spleen, splenules, adrenals, pancreas, and
opacified loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable. Note
is made of a lobulated contour of the left kidney and a slight
rotation of the right kidney which are otherwise unremarkable.
Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the abdominal aorta.
Nonspecific stranding is noted in the omentum anteriorly. There
are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymph nodes.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is extensive sigmoid
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. There is a
Foley present within the collapsed bladder. The rectum is
unremarkable. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions. Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic and
lumbar spines.

IMPRESSION:
1) Large amount of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis
consistent with clinical history of bile leak.
2) Status post cholecystectomy.
3) Nonspecific stranding in the anterior omentum, in the absence
of a known primary, this may represent reactive changes.
-----------------

[**12-16**] ERCP FINDINGS: Eight fluoroscopic spot film images were
obtained from endoscopy performed by gastroenterology staff.
Cannulation of the common bile duct was performed with
opacification of biliary tree. Extravasation of extra biliary
contrast was identified, likely into the intraperitoneal cavity
within the region of the cystic duct. There was no evidence of
intra or extra hepatic biliary dilatation or filling defects.
Final films showed placement of a plastic stent within the
common bile duct.

IMPRESSION:
Extravasation of contrast from the biliary tree within the
region of cystic duct. Placement of plastic biliary stent.
-----------------

[**12-18**] CHEST CT: An ET tube and NG tube are noted. There are
multifocal bilateral patchy air space consolidations within the
lungs, consistent with bilateral pneumonia. No cavitation is
seen to suggest lung abscess. There is a small right pleural
effusion. There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal pathologic
lymphadenopathy. There is no pericardial effusion.
Calcifications are seen within the aortic arch and descending
aorta.

ABDOMEN CT W/ORAL CONTRAST: Again noted is a moderate amount of
ascites within the upper abdomen, surrounding the liver and the
spleen. This has not changed in volume since the prior exam. The
liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
unremarkable allowing for the unenhanced technique. A metallic
stent is seen within the biliary tree. There is no sign of
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. The opacified loops of bowel are
normal in caliber. A drainage catheter enters the left lower
quadrant.

PELVIS CT W/ORAL CONTRAST: Contrast has reached the rectum
without obstruction. A rectal tube and Foley catheter are in
place. There is a small amount of residual fluid within the
pelvis, but overall, the volume of fluid has decreased markedly
since the placement of the drainage catheter. Diffuse, severe
anasarca is noted.

BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are seen throughout the
spine.
