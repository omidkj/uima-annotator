CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers and shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
man with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, type
2 diabetes, peripheral vascular disease (numerous lower
extremity bypass surgeries).  He was admitted with a one day
history of fever and shortness of breath.

The patient reports sudden onset of shortness of breath at
rest and he was feeling feverish on the day of admission.  He
denied chills, night sweats, headaches, changes in vision,
cough, nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest
pain or urinary symptoms.  He called for EMS and on arrival
they found him to have a blood pressure of 160/100, a pulse
of 58, a respiratory rate of 48 and oxygen saturation of 83.
His skin was warm to touch.  The oxygen saturation increased
to 95% on 100% nonrebreather.  His fingerstick blood glucose
was found to be 265 at that time.  In the Emergency
Department his temperature was found to be 105.1, his pulse
was 124, his blood pressure was 105/65, respiratory rate 24.
His oxygen saturation was 90% on nonrebreather.  Chest x-ray
revealed a right lower lobe and right middle lobe infiltrate.
Blood cultures were also sent.  The patient received
ceftriaxone 1 gram IV, metronidazole 1 gram IV and Tylenol 1
gram by mouth.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient reports stable one pillow
orthopnea, no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or lower extremity
edema.  He has exertion limited by hip pain.  He is not short
of breath nor does he suffer from chest pain at rest.  He has
had no sick contacts or recent travel.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post percutaneous coronary
intervention of left anterior descending artery.  Status post
non-Q wave myocardial infarction in [**2122-7-18**].  He did not
undergo cardiac catheterization at that time because of renal
disease and his stress echocardiography was unremarkable and
his ejection fraction was 20%.
2.  Cardiac catheterization in [**2120-2-17**] showed two vessel
disease with an ejection fraction of 35%.
3.  Global hypokinesis was appreciated on the echocardiogram.
4.  End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday for six months prior to presentation.  He has a
history of diabetes and renal artery stenosis.
5.  Type 2 diabetes.  He has required insulin for over 15
years.
6.  Hypertension secondary to bilateral renal artery
stenosis.
7.  Hypercholesterolemia.
8.  Anemia of chronic disease.
9.  Status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
10. Peripheral vascular disease status post bilateral femoral
artery to popliteal artery bypass grafting in [**2122-8-17**].  He
underwent excision of a left femoral pseudoaneurysm.
11. Status post bilateral cataract surgery.
12. Status post bilateral toe amputations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 105.1,
pulse ranged from 124-100, blood pressure ranged 90-105/60,
respiratory rate 24, oxygen saturation 95-99% on
nonrebreather.  Generally, he was awake, alert and oriented
speaking in full sentences in no acute distress.  HEENT:
Extraocular movements intact.  Anicteric sclerae.  Oropharynx
clear.  Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous
distention.  Heart:  Regular rate, tachycardic.  No murmur
appreciated (but has +3 mitral regurgitation).  Of note, the
chest had a Quinton catheter in the right subclavian vein.
Lungs:  Crackles one-third of the way up, decreased breath
sounds at the bases.  There was no fremitus or egophony.
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, non-distended with normal bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Warm without edema.  There were
chronic venous stasis changes.  There were superficial
ulcerations over the tibia and dry skin.  Neurologic:
Examination was unremarkable.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 6.8, hematocrit 42.2,
platelets 215,000.  INR 1.1.  Chemistry panel was significant
as follows:  135/3.9/97/22/26/3.3, glucose 275.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 75 mg twice daily.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg daily.
3.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg daily.
4.  Folic acid 1 mg daily.
5.  Aggrastat 10 mg daily.
6.  Colace 100 mg twice daily.
7.  Protonix 40 mg daily.
8.  Iron sulfate 325 mg three times daily.
9.  Nephrocaps one daily.
10. Captopril 6.25 mg three times daily.
11. Plavix 75 mg daily.

Of note, the patient states he does not take any of his
medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] quit tobacco in
[**2122-8-17**].  He smoked half a pack a day for 60 years.  He
does not drink alcohol.  He is a retired engineer.  Prior to
presentation he was able to perform all his activities of
daily living independently except for limitation from chronic
hip pain.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Significant for left bundle branch block,
no acute ST/T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient had a long complicated hospital
course.  He was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit for hypertension and treatment of fevers.  An
extensive workup revealed infection of his dialysis catheter
with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  That line
was eventually discontinued, however, the patient was unable
to clear his infection in that he developed peritonitis after
peritoneal dialysis was initiated.  Similarly, attempts to
place central catheters revealed clots in his left subclavian
as well as his right internal jugular vein suggesting
endovascular infection as well.  Serial echocardiograms
showed worsening mitral regurgitation, however, after one
transesophageal echocardiogram, the patient refused further
tests requiring intubation.

Of note, the patient was also found to have a paraspinal
abscess also growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.  He underwent one drainage by Interventional
Radiology with minimal improvement in his pain.  Serial blood
cultures continued to grow methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus after this procedure.  Also the
patient's pneumonia did not resolve completely after
initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was also marked by several
episodes of a sustained ventricular tachycardia with
hypotension.  He received a successful defibrillatory shock
upon transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  On [**2123-4-24**], amiodarone was administered intravenously.
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was initiated in the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  In consultation with the
patient's wife and daughters, decision was made to
discontinue further invasive therapy, to not continue further
testing, to provide pressor medications for electrical shock.
The patient was transferred to the Medical floor.
