Pertinent Results:
[**2133-10-14**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system revealed 3 vessel coronary artery disease.
The LMCA was normal. The LAD had a 60% stenosis proximally, and
a 70% stenosis in the mid portion at the bifurcation of D3. The
LCX had a 90% proximal stenosis. The RCA had a 95% proximal
stenosis at the conus, and was occluded in the mid portion. The
distal RCA was a large vessel with posterior ventricular
branches filling via extensive left-to-right collaterals from
the LAD and LCX. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed
moderate to severe systemic arterial hypertension with central
aortic pressures of 175/70mm Hg.

[**2133-10-14**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA with no stenosis. Left ICA with
stenosis <40% .

[**2133-10-15**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a centrally directed jet
of mitral regurgitation that is at least mild to moderate but
does border on moderate. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room at the time of the study.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted and underwent cardiac catheterization on [**10-14**]
following an abnormal ETT. Cardiac catheterization revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease and she was referred
for surgical intervention. She underwent appropriate
pre-operative work-up and was brought to the operating room on
[**10-15**] where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  Please see operative report for surgical details.
Vancomycin was given for perioperative antibiotics.  Following
surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for hemodynamic
monitoring.  Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one her
chest tubes were removed and she was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. Epicardial pacing wires were
removed on post-op day three. She continued to make good
progress while working with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. On post-op day five she was discharged home with
daughter who she lives with.
