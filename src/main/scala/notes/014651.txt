History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 year old woman with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis s/p two transplants in [**2136**], then in [**2137**] who
presented with acute altered mental status on [**2144-3-10**]. Per
husband, patient had an unwitnessed fall on Wed, found on snow
by neighbors. This was followed by AMS on Thursday, with ED
visit on Friday complaining of "pain everywhere", some nausea,
and headache.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8  85/60  88  18  96%RA. Patient
was given 4L of NS, but pressures did not improve. She was then
given levofed for hypotension via a fem line that was placed. Pt
was intubated with TV 400 Rate 14/5 PEEP, 100% FIO2. Pt was
given calcium gluconate 1gm and 10 units of insulin regular for
hyperkalemia with QRS widening and peaked t-waves. Patient was
given 3 amps sodium bicarb in 1L D5W for low bicarb per renal.
Was given 10 mg of albuterol neb, and 1mg IV ativan for groin
line placement as pt was extremely agitated. Patient was also
given 10mg IV decadron. Pt was also given 100mcg of neo. Last
set of vitals were 95  93/53  100% on above vent settings. She
was also given versed and fentanyl gtt. She was also given cipro
400 IV for UTI and rocuronium 25 for intubation and propofol
100mg IV ONCE for intubation.
.
On the floor, the patient remains intubated and sedated, unable
to follow commands.

Baseline artifact makes P wave interpretation difficult. Sinus
rhythm.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Consider left
anterior
fascicular block. Tall peaked T waves in the inferior and
lateral leads.
Consider hyperkalemia or ischemia. Poor R wave progression.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2143-1-5**] bradycardia is absent. The QRS
complex is wider
with tall peaked T waves suggesting the possibility of
hyerkalemia.
