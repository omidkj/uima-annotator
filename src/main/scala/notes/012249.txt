Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Leg pain, AMS, hypotension, leukocytosis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4148**] is a 83 year old male with a history of MDS, CVAs,
PVD, CHF, colon cancer s/p iliostomy, and recent C. difficile
collitis who presents with left leg pain and altered mental
status was found to be relatively hypotensive and have a
leukocytosis.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 4148**] was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-21**] and treated
for left leg pain. His furosemide dose was decreased on that
admission and he began receiving weekly transfusions for his
end-stage MDS. Per his family, his bilateral lower extremity has
progressively worsened over the last couple of weeks and the
redness in his left lower leg has worsened significantly in the
last two days. Per family, the patient's PCP increased the
patient's lasix to 20 mg daily yesterday. Per family, Mr.
[**Known lastname 4148**], became unusually cantankerous the evening prior to
admission, and this morning he was screaming at family asking to
have his legs taken off because of the pain. He seemed somewhat
more confused as well. Last night he also had night sweats and
chills. It is unclear if he was febrile as a temperature was not
taken. He did not receive any of his morning medications this
morning and family brought him to the ED because of concern for
the leg pain and possible sepsis from his leg.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: BP 106/54, HR 72, R 30 O2 sat 86%.
Patient was felt to globally appear unwell. Labs were notable
for a WBC count of 37.2 and lactate of 3.3. Chest x-ray was read
as no acute process. Patient was given cefepime 2g IV,
levofloxacin 750 mg IV, 500 cc NS, a six pack of platelets, and
morphine 1 mg IV x 5. He was ordered for blood but did not
receive it prior to leaving the ED. Vital signs on transfer were
BP 91/55, HR 100, 98% on RA, RR 16.
.
On the floor, the patient states that he feels terrible, but is
unable to specify exactly why he feels so, and initially denied
any pain anywhere (specifically chest, abdomen, legs, headache).
He denied any shortness of breath or nausea. He was unable to
urinate, but refused a catheter. Family states mental status is
still not normal but somewhat improved from earlier.
.
Review of sytems: (per family and patient)
(+) Per HPI, + intermittant bleeding around the osteomy but none
today. + non-productive cough for several days to a week. +
intermittant difficulty/coughing with swallowing over the past
few days. + abdominal discomfort earlier today
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
increased ostomy output. No dysuria.
