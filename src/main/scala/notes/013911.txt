Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8928**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
89 year old woman with dementia, COPD, diastolic CHF, HTN,
brought in from nursing home for shortness of breath, productive
cough, wheezing for the past few days. Tmax 99.6. Had portable
CXR which showed possible RLL collapse/pneumonia. Son did not
want her sent in so she was started on levofloxacin, flagyl, and
prednisone. Symptoms worsened today so she was sent to the ED.

.
In the ED initial VS were 97.7, 94, 132/65, 20, 96% on 4L.
Wheezy on exam. Labs notable for normal WBC (but 86%N), Hct 35.5
(at baseline), Cr 1.7 (baseline ~1.5), normal lactate. EKG sinus
at 93, NA/NI, no ischemia. CXR showed small right effusion with
questionable opacity at right lung base. Patient was given
vanc/cefepime for HCAP as well as albuterol and ipratropium
nebs. Desatted to 88% on 5L NC so placed on a NRB. VS prior to
transfer were afebrile, 91, 20, 126/63, 99% on NRB.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is resting comfortably in bed
but is non-verbal but intermittently agitated.

IMAGING:
ECHO [**2144-5-15**]:
Extremely limited image quality. The left atrium is dilated. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function appears grossly normal (LVEF ? 70%). Overall right
ventricular systolic function appears grossly normal. There is a
small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

DVT scan [**2144-5-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Non-occlusive thrombus involving the right superficial
femoral vein.
2.  No DVT in left lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5448**] is an 89 year old woman with a history of COPD,
diastolic CHF, and HTN who presented with SOB, cough, and
wheezing.  Her course was complicated by DVT and delirium vs
worsening dementia.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

1. Shortness of breath/cough/wheezing: Upon admission, initial
diferential favored a COPD exacerbation given her diffuse
wheezing and history of COPD. However, also with R lung opacity,
some of which appeared to be potentially due to a chronic shift
of heart to the right (present on prior films), and therefore
could not rule out a RML pneumonia, though no leukocytosis or
fever. Of note respiratory viral antigen panel was negative. No
evidence of pulmonary edema to suggest a distolic CHF
exacerbation and echo with grossly normal LV function. In light
of the likely COPD exacerbation and remote but sufficient
concern for pneumonia, both were treated.  Supplemental oxygen,
albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer treatments and a prednisone
burst were begun. Initially she was treated with HCAP
coverage-vancomycin/cefepime/azithromycin, but subsequently her
antibiotic coverage was narrowed to cefpoxodime and
azithromycin. Once she was transferred to the general medicine
floor her oxygen was weaned and a steroid taper was began.

2. DVT
Due to persistent tachycardia and continued oxygen requirements
there was concern for a DVT.  A CT of the chest and venous
doppler studies were ordered.  The venous doppler studies
demonstrated an occulsion in the the right superficial femoral
vein.  Due to agitation, a CT chest could not be performed.  She
was started on a heparin drip with a plan to bridge to coumadin.
 However, due to increasing agitation the patient refused PO
medications and removed her IV so the heparin was switched to
levonox.  After her health care proxy decided to withdraw
aggressive care and focus on comfort measures only the
anticoagulation was held.

3. Delirium vs worsening dementia
Ms. [**Known lastname 5448**] had a known history of dementia at baseline and per
her son, often [**Name2 (NI) 16959**].  Part way through her admission she
was found to be getting increasingly agitated in the afternoons
and overnight.  At times she was hostile to staff, attempted to
assault staff, refused medications and imaging studies.  She
required bilateral hand restraints and PO, IM or IV sedation
with zyprexa, haldol, and seroquel.  Geriatrics was consulted
and they suggested increasing her home risperidone dose, and
adding seroquel every afternoon to her medication regimen, which
seemed to improve her agitation and sundowning. Following these
episodes of agitation discussions about the utility of more
invasive care with Ms. [**Known lastname **] son (the health care proxy)
began. Mr. [**Known lastname 5448**], along with his family, decided to focus on
comfort measures and asked us to withdraw aggressive care.
After a few days of comfort care, mental status improved and she
was discharged to rehabilitation with a consideration for
hospice care afterwards. Rispiridone was increased to 1mg daily
and seroquel 12.5 mg was added in the afternoon.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Hypertension: stable during this admission
Metoprolol was continued, until the decision was made to
transition to comfort measures only.

# Hyperlipidemia: Simvastatin was continued, until the decision
was made to transition to comfort measures only.

# Diastolic CHF: An echo performed in the MICU demonstrated
dilated LA and preserved ejection fraction. Furosemide, and
spironolactone were continued through the admission and through
discharge. Daily weights showed no increase in weight.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
