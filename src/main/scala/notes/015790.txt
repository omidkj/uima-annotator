Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 668**]
Chief Complaint:
ESRD on HD, admitted for kidney transplant

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization
LURT, aborted due to PEA cardiac arrest post-anesthesia
induction


History of Present Illness:
60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease secondary to
hypertension and diabetes. He was on dialysis for approximately
7 months with a right IJ
PermCath.  His hypertension and diabetes has been complicated by
nephropathy, and coronary artery disease, for which he underwent
cardiac bypass in [**2123-6-11**].  He also has had AICD placed.  He
underwent percutaneous intervention
in the spring of [**2124**] and was recently diagnosed with atrial
flutter prior to his scheduled transplant in [**2125-4-10**]. The
kidney transplant was subsequently postponed after he underwent
ablation of the arrhythmia site and required anticoagulation
postoperatively.  [**Known firstname **] also notes lower extremity claudication
of about 1 to 2 blocks.  His pretransplant workup encouraged a
stress test that was unremarkable.  He underwent a cardiac echo
that demonstrated an EF of 30 to 40% with 2+ mitral
regurgitation.  Colonoscopy was performed in [**2125-1-11**] that
demonstrated only benign adenomas.  He underwent pulmonary
function tests in [**2125-5-11**] that demonstrated significantly
reduced lung volumes, which are essentially unchanged from those
performed in [**2120**].  He underwent lower extremity Dopplers
noninvasive studies in [**2124-8-11**] that demonstrated
noncompressible muscles bilaterally.  He had a marked decrease
in his ankle brachial index with exercise.  The interpretation
was severe peripheral vascular disease worsened by ambulation.
Following these pre-operative tests, a decision was made to
proceed with surgery and he was admitted on [**2125-7-17**] to undergo
kidney transplant.

Social History:

music group. Rare alcohol use, denies tobacco use x22 years,
denies illicit drug use.


Family History:
Father died at 79 of an MI, had bypass at age 70
Mother died at age 82 of CHF and DM
Brother had stents placed at age 58

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 171/100 mm Hg while seated.  Pulse was 67
(paced) beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was (vent SIMV
600 x 12 or 15/5).
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor
or cyanosis of the oral mucosa.  The neck was supple with JVP of
20 cm.  The carotid waveform was normal.  There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis.  The lungs had coarse crackles bilaterally with.
Cardiovascular examination revealed RRR, S1/S2, MR murmur,
displaced PMI.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was
soft nontender and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor,
cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or
carotid bruits.
There were palpable pulses bilaterally.  Lower extremities were
warm.
Neurologically: exam limited by sedation but no spontaneous
movements, no withrawal to pain; no corneal reflexes; no gag.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**2125-7-17**], scheduled for kidney transplant, from a
living unrelated
donor. Shortly after anesthesia induction, however, he went into
PEA arrest. CPR was initiated immediately, reportedly with
adequate chest compressions. He was given at least one round of
epinephrine. After 10-12 minutes, cardiac rhythm was regained.
He
was transferred to the ICU; however, concern arose when, 2 hours
after propofol was turned off, he still was not responsive to
sternal rub. Intraoperative ECHO ([**7-17**]) revealed dilation of the
left ventricular cavity was moderately dilated, with severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The right
ventricular cavity was also dilated and right ventricular
systolic function appeared depressed. The aortic  valve leaflets
(3) were mildly thickened but aortic stenosis was not present.
The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation was seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets were
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2125-4-20**], contractile function of the left
ventricle (and probably right ventricle as well) was
significantly further reduced. Due to these findings, he
underwent right heart catheterization performed by entry into a
preexistent left internal jugular vein cordis, using a
thermodilution Swan-Ganz catheter, and advanced to the PCW
position. Findings revealed elevated right sided filling
pressures and elevated Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. He
was brought to the SICU post-operatively and was evaluated by
the cardiology, nephrology, and neurology services. Cardiology
recommended controlling BP and rechecking TEE. TEE post
resuscitation revealed worse
LV function than preop (Preop LVEF 40; TEE today reportedly LVEF
20), and starting heparin gtt and aspirin. Repeat ECHO on [**7-19**]
revealed dilated left ventricle with severe systolic
dysfunction, dilated right ventricle with at least mild systolic
dysfunction, and mild pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2125-7-17**], the findings were
similar. Neurology recommendations included: CTA of head and
neck (MRI possible due to AICD), IV thiamine 100 mg daily,
avoiding sedating medications, maintaining normothermia,
continuing normoglycemia with insulin drip, allowing BP to
autoregulate until thrombosis and infarct excluded, and
continuing IV heparin until thrombosis excluded. The patient
initially was placed on nitroprusside drip and hydralazine to
control elevated blood pressures.
He was transferred to the floor once stable and was to be
discharged to the care of his cardiologist, appointments were
made.
