Imaging

CXR [**2192-11-28**]: LLL multilobar infiltrate

[**2192-12-6**]
AP & LATERAL CHEST: The heart size is within normal limits. Mild
pulmonary edema has decreased. Small to moderate bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar pulmonary opacities are
unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1) Decreased mild pulmonary edema.
2) Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
opacities.

[**2192-12-5**] Echocardiograph
Poor echo windows.The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably mildly depressed.
Basal to mid antero-septal and inferior hypokinesis is
suggested, but not confirmed. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion appear normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of  [**2176-12-20**], regional LV systolic dysfunction is
now suggested. If clinically indicated, a repeat TTE with
contrast (Definity) may better characterize LVEF and regional LV
function.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 71 year old gentleman with T2N0M0 soft palate squamous
cell CA, undergoing adjuvant chemoradiation week [**5-8**] of low dose
[**Doctor Last Name **]/Taxol and daily XRT. He was iniitally admitted on [**11-28**]
with hypotension, tachycardia, ARF. Felt to be dehydrated at
that time. He was hydrated with NS and then developed fevers and
was noted to have LLL opacity. He was initially given cefepime,
fluconazole (concern for esophagitis), flagyl.  This was then
switched to Levo and vanco. Later, flagyl was re-started.  He
had frequent desaturations that were found to be secondary to
mucus plugging and which resolved with deep suctioning. His
sputum cultures then grew back Coag + staph sensitive to
oxacillin and vanco was switched to oxacillin. .  On [**2192-12-4**] pt
respiratory status deteriorated to the point he could only
maintain adequate oxygenatin on non-rebreather.  By this time he
had been getting significant amounts of fluid with a daily fluid
balance positive 500-1000ml per day. CXR's have also shown
progressive pulmonary edema

In [**Name (NI) 153**], pt. did not require intubation.  It was felt his resp
distress was secondary to pulm edema/volume overload and we was
therefore diuresed with PRN lasix 40 mg.  Over LOS in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he
was roughly -1.2 L.  An echocardiogram revealed the patient had
deteriorated LV function and new wall motion abnormalities.
His resp. status did improve such that he was saturating
adequately on 40% FM.  He had been afebrile and otherwise
hemodynamically stable and was therefore transferred back to the
floor.  Over the subsequently few days of his hospital course
the pt. felt his breathing had improved and he had no fevers,
chest pain, or cough.  His volume status returned to euvolemic
state.  He was slowly weaned from oxygen support and by
discharge was down to 3L face mask.  Repeat CXR revealed stable
lower lobe infiltrates but almost complete resolution of
pulmonary edema.  Aggressive diuresis was no longer pursued.
External radiation therapy for his oral squamous cell CA was
resumed.  On discharge, the patient remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable.  He was to continue 5 more days of
levo/flagyl, oxacillin was discontinued.  He was transferred to
a rehabilitation hospital to enable further improvement of his
respiratory status and for reconditioning.

In summary, this is a 71 year old gentleman with oral squamous
cell carcinoma on radiation therapy who was admitted for fever
and finding of lower lobe lung infiltrates.  He developed
respiratory distress from a combination of pneumonia, new CHF
seen on echocardiography, and mucus plugging and required a
brief stay in intensive care but not intubation.  He did well
with diuretic therapy for his CHF, antibiotics for his MSSA
pneumonia and was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital to
enable further improvement of his respiratory status.
.
Issues and plan arising from this hospitalization:

1) Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia- Now appears resolved.  Secondary
to combination of PNA, CHF exacerbation, ? mucus plugging.  No
intubation was required.
- albuterol/atrovent nebs q4h.
- Chest PT, aggressive suctioning as needed
- Aggressive diuresis no longer needed.

2) CHF.  now with apparently worsened EF, new wall motion
abnormalities
- Will need oupatient follow up with Cardiology.
- Continue Lasix, Lisinopril, and metoprolol.
- Watch for signs of overload (weight gain, edema)
.
3) RLL and LLL multilobar PNA: Initially with LLL o
