Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Unstable VTach

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation


History of Present Illness:
78yoM with h/o DM2, unclear CAD but reported stents/CABG who
developed chest heaviness after having 4 BM's this morning;
described as substernal pressure, no radiation, associated with
diaphoresis. He went to lay back down and the chest heaviness
persisted, he started feeling restless, then got up out of bed
and started feeling very dizzy; at which point he called his
nephew [**Name (NI) **]. EMS found him to be in ? VTach in the 160-170's and
was taken to [**Hospital3 **].
.
There, he had been having chest pressure for about 6 hrs. He was
initially responsive with BP's 94/40's and EKG was concerning
for stable VTach. He was Amiodarone 150mg bolused however then
reportedly became unresponsive and was cardioverted with 200J's
with resultant sinus rhythm in the 60's, and SBP's in the 90's.
His blood pressure then dropped to 70/40's and he received 0.1mg
Epinephrine with resultant BP's 130/70's and HR 50-70's, which
is near his current vitals [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] signout. Respiratorily,
he is RR 25-30's and 100% on NRB. EKG most recently shows NSR
with 1st degree AVB, inferolateral depressions, and <1 mm
elevations in aVR and V1. Through [**Hospital1 **], he also received 2L NS
and 3mg Versed. Labs showed a negative TropI at <0.06 (<0.39),
WBC 12.3 and Hct 26, BUN/Cr 24/1.8. (see below)
.
He was transferred on Amiodarone gtt, Heparin 950/hr, and
reportedly received ASA 81 mg x4, no Plavix.
.
ROS is mostly notable for what he reports as "bloody stool" for
the past 3 months, described as "pink" or marroon, and states
his last colonoscopy was 3 yrs ago and was OK. Otherwise, no
fevers/chills/sweats, cough, SOB, n/v, abd pain, diarrhea,
constipation, dysuria, BPH sxs, skin changes, lower extremity
edema. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for lack of chest pain
other than that described above. He notes exertional fatigue
worsening over the past year, having to take more frequent
breaks, and with soreness of his ankles, but no angina or clear
SOB. No PND, orthopnea. He states he gets what sounds like an
echo ? 1-2 times per year that have been normal.

Micro:
Urine culture from [**2126-10-16**] and Blood culture from [**2126-10-15**] no
growth to date

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2126-10-15**]
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  30%
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP):  *32 to 37 mm Hg
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. LV systolic function appears depressed
(ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. The
lateral wall is also hypokinetic. The right ventricular free
wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2126-10-15**]
No previous images. There is enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette
with evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite
pleural effusion or acute focal pneumonia.

EP Report: [**2126-10-17**]:
EP study + ablation of ventricular tachycardia
Conclusions:
1. Monomorphic VT with 3 different morphologies, all RBBB
superior axis arising from region of basal inferior scar,
however, none were consistent with clinical VT (RBBB inferior
axis leads)
2. Predominant morphology was RBBB superior axis, positive
across precordial leads, most isoelectric in I and V6 with CL of
380ms, well tolerated hemodynamically
3. Moderate sized basal inferior and inf
