Admission Date:  [**2168-12-14**]       Discharge Date:  [**2168-12-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2114-1-5**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 28989**] is a pleasant,
54-year-old male with a known history of coronary artery
disease with a catheterization in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year which
showed 3-vessel coronary artery disease.  However, the
patient was ultimately referred to outpatient medical therapy
because he denied permission for a coronary artery bypass
graft.  His symptoms persisted with angina on exertion and
had a positive stress test approximately one month ago.
Ultimately, he agreed to a coronary artery bypass graft and
was transferred from the [**Hospital3 15174**] where he
was recently admitted for substernal chest pressure and a
rule out myocardial infarction protocol.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for cardiac risk factors of hypercholesterolemia,
positive family history, as well as hypertension.  He did
have a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in [**2168-7-10**].  He
has had low back pain chronically requiring narcotics to
treat.  He did fracture his right foot 10 years ago.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   His past surgical history included
tonsillectomy.  He has had a lymph node removed from his neck
35 years ago, and a hair implant 20 years ago.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was notable just for
exertional substernal chest pain relived with nitroglycerin.
He had no respiratory complaints.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  His medications on admission were
atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, Lipitor, nitroglycerin.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  His examination was
notable for a blood pressure of 100/70, heart rate of 60, in
no acute distress.  His head, ears, nose, eyes and throat
examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Mucous membranes were moist.
His trachea was midline.  No bruit.  Heart had a regular rate
and rhythm with no murmurs.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, with no bruit.  His extremities were normal.
There were normal palpable posterior tibialis and dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His admission laboratories
were notable for white blood cell count [**Pager number **], hematocrit 39,
platelets 84,000.  Chemistries were sodium of 137,
potassium 4.4, chloride 100, bicarbonate 27, blood urea
nitrogen 18, creatinine 1.2, glucose 101.  PT and INR were
within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was therefore admitted on [**12-14**] to
the Cardiothoracic Surgery Service to have his coronary
artery bypass graft to be completed on [**2168-12-16**].

Additional information about the admission workup included a
chest x-ray that was negative.  A urinalysis that was also
negative.

The patient went to the operating theater on [**2168-12-16**]
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**], where he underwent a 4-vessel coronary artery
bypass graft.  He received grafts including left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery, left
radial graft to the PL, as well as saphenous vein graft to
the first obtuse marginal, sequential to the diagonal.

Postoperatively, he was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit where he was on nitroglycerin, propofol, and
Neo-Synephrine.

On postoperative day one the patient was taken off of
Pressonex.  His Neo-Synephrine was weaned to off.  He was
placed on a cardiac diet.  He was started on Lopressor,
Lasix, and aspirin.  His postoperative hematocrit was 26,
white count of 15,000.  Platelets were 319.  Blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine of 15 and 0.8.

Ultimately, he was transferred to the floor on postoperative
day one.  His postoperative course was complicated only by
high pain requirement.  The patient ultimately had an Acute
Pain consultation and was placed on oxycodone 10 mg to 20 mg
p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. as well as Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4-6h.
p.r.n.

On postoperative day three, his temperature was noted to
be 101.5.  He was cultured times two.  Additionally, he got a
chest x-ray that showed a new left retrocardiac density since
surgery which was suspicious for a possible pneumonia.
Urinalysis was negative.  Blood cultures did not grow out
anything during his hospital course.  He was empirically
started on Levaquin and Flagyl to treat presumed pneumonia.
His temperature curve quickly defervesced once he was started
on the empiric therapy.  His pain was well controlled.  He
was ambulating and voiding spontaneously.  Portable chest
x-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax, just small
bilateral effusions, right greater than left.  Additionally,
the aforementioned retrocardiac densities were present on the
left side.

By postoperative day four, the patient was ambulating a level
V and had completed stairs.  His discharge laboratories were
notable for a hematocrit of 23, a white blood cell count
of 13,000, as well as blood urea nitrogen of 16, and
creatinine of 0.8.  His discharge examination was notable for
a temperature of 98, pulse 87, blood pressure 115/70,
respiratory rate 20, 92% on 2 liters, in no acute distress.
His sternum was stable.  There was no drainage.  No was no
erythema.  The staples were intact.  His heart was regular
with no murmur.  His lungs were clear to auscultation except
for decreased breath sounds, left greater than right.  No
crackles were present, however.  His abdomen was benign.  His
lower extremities were warm and well perfused with palpable
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (The patient's discharged
medications included the following)
 1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. times seven days.
 3.  K-Dur 20 mEq p.o. q.d. times seven days.
 4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. while he is taking oxycodone.
 5.  Oxycodone 10 mg to 20 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
 6.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 7.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 8.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
 9.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a total course of seven
days (to be completed by [**2168-12-26**]).
10.  Flagyl 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. (to be completed by
[**2168-12-26**]).

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   The patient's follow up will include
being seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in one month from the time of
discharge.  He will require no home services with [**Hospital6 3429**].  He was to be seen in the Wound Care
Clinic one week from the time of this discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient's disposition was to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable,
afebrile.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Status post 4-vessel coronary artery
bypass graft for unstable angina.
