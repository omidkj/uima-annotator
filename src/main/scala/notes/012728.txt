Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/Three vessel disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2162-6-11**] - CABGx4 (left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein double
sequential graft from the aorta to the 1st diagonal and 1st
obtuse marginal coronary arteries; as well as reverse saphenous
vein single graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary
artery).


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 70-year-old gentleman who complained of
unstable angina symptoms. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated
severe 3-vessel coronary
disease. The patient was therefore referred for coronary artery
bypass grafting. The patient understood the risks and benefits
of the procedure including, but not limited to, bleeding,
infection, myocardial infarction, stroke, death, renal and
pulmonary insufficiency, as well as the possibility
of a blood transfusion and future revascularization procedures,
and agreed to proceed.

Diabetes
Chronic pneumonia
HTN
Hyperlipidemia
CVD
Obstructive sleep apnea
Prostate cancer
Neuropathy

[**2162-6-9**] Carotid Study
1. 40-59% stenosis was demonstrated in the right internal
carotid artery associated with mild-to-moderate calcified
plaques.
2. No stenosis or calcified plaques were noted in the left
internal carotid artery.

[**2162-6-11**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include an akinetic anterior and anteroseptal
walls, and a severely hypokinetic inferoseptal wall and apex.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[**Name (NI) 33958**] PT is receiving dobutamine at 2.5 ucg/kg/min RV
systolic function now appears normal. Poor esophageal LV windows
post bypass, however there appears to be improvement of the
anterior and septal walls [**Name (NI) **] in the setting of low dose
inotropes. LVEF ~45-50%. The LV and RV are less dilated. MR is
now trace-mild. Study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass.

[**2162-6-16**] CXR
Mild cardiomegaly and widening of the mediastinal contours are
unchanged. Left-sided chest tube is in place in unchanged
position. A small left pleural effusion has decreased slightly
in size. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis appears approximately
stable.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2162-6-8**] via transfer
from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4527**] [**Last Name (Titles) 620**] for surgical management of his
coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner which included a carotid duplex ultrasound
which showed a 40-59% stenosis was demonstrated in the right
internal carotid artery associated with mild-to-moderate
calcified plaques and a normal left internal carotid artery. An
echocardiogram was performed which showed a mildly dilated
ascending aorta and an ejection fraction of 40-45%. A CT scan
was performed for an abnormal right main stem nodule seen on
chest x-ray. The CT scan did not reveal any nodule however
showed mild interstitial disease predominantly in the right and
left lower lobes. On [**2162-6-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. He tolerated the procedure well and
please see operative note for further detail. Postoperatively he
was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known firstname **] was awake,
extubated and neurologically intact. He was slowly weaned from
pressors. Plavix was resumed for his prior history of transient
ischemic attacks. On postoperative day two, Mr. [**Known firstname **] was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further
recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Vancomycin was started for sternal drainage. An IP consult was
obatined for thoracentesis of a left pleural effusion. After
several attempts, the thoracentesis was unsuccessful and a left
chest tube was placed. [**6-17**].  1100 ml of dark bloody drainage
was obtained.  The tube stopped draining, and was removed on
[**2162-6-17**].  He has remained hemodynamically stable and is ready to
be discharged home today.
