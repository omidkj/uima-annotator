History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 58 yo M with PMH of gout who was transfered to
the cath lab from [**Hospital3 **] for STEMI treatment. Patient
reports that this morning while moving heavy objects at work he
began feeling unwell. After finishing this he began experiencing
[**7-27**], substernal to right sided, pressure like chest pain that
he described as someone stepping on his chest. This was
accompanied by SOB, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations, dizzines
and finger tip numbness/tingling. The pain did not radiate to
his neck, jaw or arm. At [**Hospital3 **] his EKG revealed ST
elevations of II, III and aVF, and ST depressions of I, aVL and
V2-V6. He received ASA 325 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, heparin gtt,
4 mg morphine, atorvastatin 80 mg and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for emergent cath.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] he was taken to the cath lab where he was
found to have thrombotic total mid vessel occlusion of the RCA.
The thrombus was aspirated and 2 overlapping DES placed. After
re-perfussion he became bradycardic (HR 60) and hypotensive (BP
95/62). He received atropine x1 and dopamine gtt. These were
quickly stopped as the patient's BP and HR stabilized. He was
then transferred to the CCU.
.
In CCU, patient was feeling well with <[**1-27**] CP (was never CP
free but this was an improvement) and [**2-27**] HA. Otherwise feeling
well.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

STUDIES:
.
Admission EKG [**2121-1-24**]:  Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm with
borderline resting sinus tachycardia and prolonged P-R interval.
Inferior Q wave ST segment elevation myocardial infarction which
may be acute or evolving. Reciprocal ST segment depressions in
leads I and aVL. ST-T wave changes in leads V1-V2 raise
consideration of posterior involvement. Left ventricular
hypertrophy. Lateral ST-T wave changes consistent with
myocardial ischemia or left ventricular hypertrophy, etc.
Borderline QTc interval prolongation. No previous tracing
available for comparison. Clinical correlation is suggested
.
Cardiac Cath [**2121-1-24**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed 1 vessel coronary
artery
disease. The LM and LAD were free of angiographically
significant
stenosis. The LCx had a 20% stenosis in OM1. The RCA had a
thrombotic
mid-vessel occlusion.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure of 149/90mmHg.
3. Successful Export Thrombectomy and PTCA/Stenting of mid RCA
thrombotic occlusion with overlapping 3.0 X 30 mm ENDEAVOUR DES
(mid)
deployed at 14 atms and 3.0 X 15 mm ENDEAVOUR DES (distal)
deployed at
16 atms. Final angiogram showed TIMI3 flow, no dissection and 0%

residual stenosis in the stent.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. STEMI of mid-RCA treated with Export Thrombectomy and two
overlapping
drug eluting stents.
2. Aspirin indefinely.
3. Plavix daily for 12 months.
4. Secondary prevention of CAD.
