Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 58 yo M with known CAD, diabetes and ESRD who
presents with chest pain. He was resting today and he started
having chest pain. The pain is located in the center of his
chest and associated with shortness of breath. It has been
constant since this morning and started all of a sudden when he
was walking to the kitchen. It is a [**6-5**] in severity. He reports
that he has had nausea and vomited 3 times today with some chest
pain during the vomiting. The vomit has been clear fluid without
blood. He has been feeling weak with what is described as
occasional black vision since but has not had any dizziness,
syncope or headache. Of note, he has recently arrived from
[**Country 7192**] where he was for 10 days. While there he took his
medications every day, but was only able to go to dialysis
twice.

While in the ED initial HR 48 BP 123/102 rr 20 100% FS was 177.
Her atropine 1 mg was given at 1316. Nitro gtt was started at
1336. Also given morphine, glucagon, anzemet. Nitro drip was
increased to 100 mcg/min without relief in chest pain.
Additionally patient received sodium bicarb, calcium gluconate
3amps, magnesium sulfate, and 10 units insulin.

On arrival to the floor the patient still complained of chest
pain and shortness of breath but would intermittently fall
asleep.

EKGs demonstrated evolution in ED from sinus bradycardia to
junctional bradycardia at a rate of 36-40. Complexes were wide
with IVCD and QT prolongation.

CXR ([**2129-4-6**]):
CHF and effusion with slight interval worsening.

ECHO ([**2129-4-7**]):
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2128-9-14**], the mitral regurgitation is somewhat reduced.

No definite vegetations seen. However, if clinically suggested,
the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not
necessarily exclude endocarditis.

CAROTID US ([**2129-4-8**]):
60-69% stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid arteries;
however, this estimate of percentage of stenosis may not be
precise due to a generalized increase in systolic velocities in
the bilateral common and internal carotid arteries.

CT CHEST ([**2129-4-9**]):
Interval worsening of right lower lobe opacity, and development
of hazy lingular opacity, likely representing infiltrates, with
adjacent pleural thickening. No intrinsic or extrinsic airway
obstruction is identified.

Atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and coronary arteries.
Stable cardiomegaly.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hyperkalemia/ESRD:
Presented with hyperkalemia (>7) in the setting of 2 dialysis
sessions in 10 days.  This was urgently treated, given symptoms
(weakness, vomiting) and ECG changes.  Follow acute treatment in
ED, was dialyzed daily.  Last inpatient dialysis session was on
[**4-9**] with plan for next outpatient session on [**4-12**].  He was
continued on sevelamer and nephrocaps.

2. CAD:
Previously patent grafts on catherization.  Presented with chest
pains which were concerning but in the setting of persistent
nontypical pain, this was thought to be likely secondary to
other causes.  Did have CK and troponin elevations, but has
chronic troponin elevations.  He was continued on his aspirin
and isosorbide mononitrate.  His beta-blocker was initially held
in the setting of bradycardia, but this was started after
stabilitization of his rhythm and dialysis.

3. Rhythm:
Presented in sinus bradycardia though briefly had junctional
bradycardia while in the ED.  This may ha
