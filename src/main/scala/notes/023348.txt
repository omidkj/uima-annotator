HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year-old
woman with a history of coronary artery disease, coronary
artery bypass graft in [**2182-10-6**], diabetes mellitus
type 2, cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**], peripheral vascular
disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease with a
esophagogastroduodenoscopy who had presented to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital on [**8-28**] with left substernal chest pain 5 to 7
out of 10 in severity and lightheadedness, but no other
symptoms.  She was admitted to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital and ruled
out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and both CK and
troponin.

thallium test and was sent to [**Hospital1 188**] for catheterization with a blood pressure of 180/70,
pulse 81, O2 sat of 97% on room air.  It was found that her
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal number one was
completely occluded.  Her left main 70% lesion was stented
and her 60% stenosis and her mid left circumflex was stented
without complications.  However, after the procedure she had
300 cc of bright red emesis.  Her blood pressure decreased
slightly, so the patient was given one unit of packed red
blood cells, transferred to the CCU and given 1 mg of vitamin
K intravenously.  She was admitted to the CCU for an EGD,
transfusion of another unit of packed red blood cell and
monitoring.  She had no history of upper GI bleed, melena and
no history of OV positive stools in the past.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes type 2
treated with insulin, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
Schatzki's ring, cerebrovascular accident in [**2178**] with
residual left hemiparesis treated with Coumadin, TAH/BSO,
peripheral vascular disease, status post appendectomy,
coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass graft in
[**10/2182**] with a left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending, right saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal number one and radial to the posterior descending
artery.  History of congestive heart failure with an EF of
approximately 30% and hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 50 b.i.d., Premarin
0.625 q.d., aspirin 325 q.d., Prevacid 30 q.d., Captopril
12.5 t.i.d., Lasix 20 b.i.d., Serax 10 mg prn, insulin 70/30
30 units q.a.m. and 50/50 18 units q.p.m., Lipitor 10 mg po
q.h.s., Coumadin 2 mg q.d., Singulair 10 mg q.d. and Ambien 5
mg po q.h.s. prn.

ALLERGIES:  Barium, which causes swelling.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A daughter had an myocardial infarction at
the age of 33.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for tobacco and alcohol.  She lives
alone.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, blood pressure 160
to 192/60 to 70.  Pulse 74.  Respiratory rate 12.  O2 sat
100% on 4 liters.  General, she was awake, alert and oriented
times three.  She was in no adenopathy.  Mucous membranes are
moist and pink.  No jugulovenous distention appreciable.  No
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart regular rate and rhythm with a widely
split S1, but no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, obese with scars present from prior surgeries.
Extremities no edema.  1+ bilateral pulses in lower
extremities and neurological examination cranial nerves II
through XII were intact.  Sensation was intact.  Motor was
[**5-10**] except for the left iliopsoas and left triceps, which
were [**4-10**].

LABORATORY:  Hematocrit 28.6.  Chem 7 was notable for sodium
133, potassium 5.2, BUN 24, creatinine 1.0, glucose 231, CK
and troponin were negative.  Electrocardiogram revealed
normal sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block noted to
be old.  Normal axis.  Catheterization on [**9-1**]
revealed two vessel and left main disease with a 70% osteal
lesion, left circumflex with a 40% osteal lesion and 60% mid
segmental lesion and right coronary artery with a tubular 80%
proximal stenosis.  Vein graft was occluded.  There was a
mild kink in the left internal mammary artery and moderately
elevated left ventricular and diastolic pressure at 19.
Moderate impaired left ventricular systolic function, 36%
ejection fraction with global hypokinesis.  Stents were
placed in the mid left circumflex and the left main.  Mild 1+
mitral regurgitation was present.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and transfused a
second unit of packed red blood cells.  The
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done that afternoon in the
CCU, which revealed 400 cc of red blood clot in the antrum of
the stomach.  Also a Dieulafoy lesion was noted, which had
epinephrine injected into it and bleeding resolved.  There
was also some mild gastritis noted not felt to be
contributing to the bleeding.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable and restarted on prior medications
including Captopril and Lopressor.  She was transferred to
the floor the day after admission.

The patient was stable on the floor and was seen by physical
therapy and hematocrit remained stable throughout her
hospital course.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to be discharged home with

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lopressor 50 b.i.d., Premarin 0.625

Chest pain most likely secondary to gastritis and Dieulafoy
lesion.  Patient with severe three vessel coronary artery
