Service:  CSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 41 year old female was
transferred into our Medical Center at 4:30 in the morning,
with a two day history of chest pain radiating to her back.
She had no neurologic symptoms.  She had mild dyspnea.  The
pain, subjectively by the patient, was 8 over 10 and was
unrelieved by position and medications thus far at the time
of examination. She had no family history of coronary artery
disease at a young age or aortic dissection.  No use of
tobacco.  She presented to an outside hospital and was
transferred in.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Patent ductus arteriosus closure at
age 7.  She was on no medications at the time of examination
and had no known allergies.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  After the patient was extubated,
additional medical history was determined with the patient
and her family.  Bilateral breast reductions.
Cholecystectomy.  Right foot surgery.  PPA versus VSD repair
in the past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  She had no family history of coronary artery
disease, pulmonary disease, Marfan's, bleeding disorders or
anesthesia complications.  She had no use of tobacco and rare
alcohol use.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Unable to be completed secondary to the
patient's agitation and urgency of the patient's situation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, her pressure was
87/47.  She was in acute distress.  Heart rate was 80 and
sinus rhythm with a respiratory rate of 24, saturating 94
percent on room air.  Her sclera were anicteric and the
conjunctiva appeared pink and moist.  Neck was supple without
carotid bruits.  Her lungs were clear bilaterally.  Heart was
regular rate and rhythm with a grade 4/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the upper right sternal border.  Her abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Her extremities had no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  She had decreased bilateral
femoral pulses.  She was alert and oriented with a nonfocal
neurologic examination.  Cranial nerves 2 through 12 were
intact. She had good strength at 5/5 and sensation was intact
in all four extremities.  CT scan showed an 8 cm aortic
dissection, beginning above her aortic valve, which measured
approximately 4 cm.

All laboratory studies were pending at the time that the
patient was taken to the operating room.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken emergently to the
operating room on [**9-24**], the day of admission and had an
ascending aortic replacement done with a 28 mm Gel-weave
graft and an aortic valve replacement with a 21 mm [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve and redo sternotomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
patient was taken to the cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit
in stable condition with a Propofol drip with 15 mcg per kg
per minute, an epinephrine drip of 0.03 mcg/kg per minute,
Milrinone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute and a nitroglycerin
drip at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute.  On postoperative day number
one, the patient was awake and following commands but
remained intubated.  She was in first degree arteriovenous
block.  Blood pressure was 111/47.  Cardiac index was 2.2.

Postoperative laboratory studies were as follows:  White
count 16.6; hematocrit of 29.9; platelet count 148,000.
Potassium 4.0; BUN 12; creatinine 0.9.  The plan was to try
and discontinue the patient's epinephrine drip and wean it to
off during the day, as well as attempting to wean off her
Milrinone later that day also.  In addition, the patient was
monitored for the possibility of weaning her to extubate her.

On postoperative day number two, the patient continued to
follow commands.  She remained intubated on an epinephrine
drip at 0.01, Milrinone at 0.5, nitroglycerin at 0.5 and
insulin drip of two units per hour.  Her creatinine remained
stable at 0.7.

Significant efforts were made to aggressively diurese the
patient in the first 48 hour period.  This would help to
improve her oxygenation.  The patient was also started on
Diamox and initial review was done by case management and
physical therapy.  On postoperative day number two, the
patient was extubated and her chest tubes were removed. She
was started on her first dose of Coumadin 3 mg, given prior
for her mechanical [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] valve.  On postoperative day
number three, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a
heart rate in the 90's and a pressure of 124/44.  She was
saturating well on four liters nasal cannula.  She remained
on a Milrinone drip, epinephrine drip had been weaned off.
The patient was started on heparin drip to help keep her
therapeutic while her INR was rising from her first Coumadin
dose.  The patient continued to be AV paced as she had
complete heart block with some accelerated junctional
tachycardia periodically.  Her cardiac index dropped to 1.6
and dropped her mixed venous to 57 percent, when her heart
rate dropped below 65.  Her blood pressure remained stable
but the patient did get diaphoretic and required V-pacing at
that time. Milrinone was increased slightly.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] from electrophysiology/cardiology consulted.
The plan was to watch the patient at this time, in
preparation possibly for a pacer in the near future.  On
postoperative day number four, it was determined that the
patient would require Milrinone.  She was unable to tolerate
the wean of the Milrinone and remained on her heparin drip,
as she was being dosed with Coumadin.  Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 29964**] note from electrophysiology.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable and it was determined that we would
wait and watch her periodic heart block.  On postoperative
day number five, she could not tolerate her wean of Milrinone
again and remained on Milrinone at 0.2.  She remained
hemodynamically stable. She continued with aggressive Lasix
diuresis. Heparin drip was held briefly to discontinue her
pacing wires.  The patient was also seen again by physical
therapy and was encouraged to work with them.  On
postoperative day number six, her pacing wires were
discontinued.  Her heparin drip was discontinued at an INR of
1.7.  She received an additional 3 mg of Coumadin and
Captopril was started.  Repeat echo showed an ejection
fraction to be 40 percent.  Her index was 1.71.  She was
alert and oriented. Her lungs were clear.  Her heart was
regular rate and rhythm.  Her creatinine was stable at 0.9
with a potassium of 4.4.  Blood pressure was 129/38.  Heart
rate was 65 with first degree AV block.

The patient was seen again by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 28239**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 56846**], M.D.
from electrophysiology and it was recommended that a
temporary pacer be placed or pacing with Swan-Ganz at this
time, with preparation possibly for adding a pacer placed the
following day.  On the 19th at 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon,
the patient suffered a respiratory arrest and went into
complete heart block and then into asystole.  Complete full
ACLS code was done.  The patient was reintubated.
Electrophysiology was called stat to help place a transvenous
pacing wire, which they did.  Please refer to the note from
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 284**].

On postoperative day number seven, the patient was put on PCV
for high end expiratory pressor and hypoxia.  Heparin drip
was restarted for an INR of 1.6 as it dropped slightly.  The
patient remained otherwise hemodynamically stable with a
pacing wire in place, being V-paced at 90.  Hematocrit ws
stable at 29.6 with a BUN of 17 and creatinine of 0.7. The
patient remained intubated and sedated with coarse breath
sounds.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm in her pace
mode. Repeat chest x-ray was done.  Ceftriaxone was started
for additional instrumentation for placement of the pacing
wire.  The next day, the patient did receive pacemaker
placement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 284**].  Later that day, wean from the
ventilator was begun again.  Postoperative day number 8, the
Cordis was changed over to a triple lumen catheter.  The
patient remained on V
