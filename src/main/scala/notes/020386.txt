No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
tricuspid valve endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
 [**2188-1-25**] Tricuspid valve replacement (29mm [**Company 1543**]
Mosaic),mitral valve repair(P2 resection,26mm CG Future Ring)
[**2188-1-31**] PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50463**] is a 29 year-old woman with anxiety, asthma and
active IV drug abuse who presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**1-6**]
complaining of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea of 3 days duration
and altered mental status for 1 day.
.
  In the ED, initial vitals were 130 98/58 36 99% on 55%
facemask. Labs were notable for WBC 27.5, lactate of 4.4, Tbili
6.8, Dbili 4.1, AST 182, ALT 52 ABG 7.47/29.8/290.7 on FiO2
100%. She was admitted to the  ICU and received aggressive fluid
resusciatition. A TTE on [**1-7**] identified a 1.4 cm vegetation
attached to the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and
normal LVEF of 60%. The patient continued to require large
volume resusciation for hypotension subsequenly reqiring
Phenylephirine drip and intubation. The decision was then made
to transfer the patient to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgery evaluation.
Labs on the day of transfer were Cr 1.58, WBC 27.6 80% PMNs,
Triglycerides 534 and Vancomycin 15.7. Microbiology with 4/4
blood culture bottles growing MSSA.

Pertinent Results:
TEE [**2188-1-25**]:
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is small
homogenous echodense mobile mass of 4 mm x 6mm on the posterior
mitral leaflet, atrial side near the P1 P2 junction of the
mitral valve accompanied by trivial MR and cannot rule
perforation near this mass suggestive of vegetation.
The tricuspid valve is abnormal. There is a large mass of 4 cm x
4 cm sitting on the tricuspid valve suggestive of vegetation on
the atrial aspect accompanied by. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a large pericardial
effusion. Of 2 to 3cm that became apparent as the case
progressed with the supine position of the patient.

The pulmonary valve is not well visualized and there is trivial
pulmonary regurgitation.

Post bypass: Patient is on epi 0.03 mcg/kg/min, leveophed 0.1
mcg/kg/min and vasopressin 3.6 units/hour.
RV function normal and RV is mildly dilated.
There is a bioprosthesis in the tricuspid position with a mean
gradient of 2mm of HG. There are no regurgitant jets seen. NO
massess seen suggestive of [**Month/Day/Year **] vegetation.
The mitral ring appears stable with no periprosthetic
regurgitation. There is no MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] masses seen.
Intact thoracic aorta.
LVEF 55%.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV OR ORAL CONTRAST: [**2188-1-8**].
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Multiple cavitary lesions in the periphery of both lungs,
most consistent with septic emboli due to her MSSA endocarditis.
 2. Moderate nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with
associated
atelectasis.
 3. Small amount of fluid layering dependently within the
trachea.
4. 4-mm inferior pole right renal stone without evidence of
hydronephrosis.
5. Cholelithiasis with gallbladder wall edema which could be
related to fluid overload.
6. Right lower and left upper lobe pneumonia.
 7. Hepatomegaly.

CTA CHEST [**2188-1-16**]
1. Whether solitary filling defect in lingular subsegmental
pulmonary artery is thrombus from a peripheral vein or embolized
cardiac vegetation is indeterminate.
2. Multiple abscesses from septic emboli have increased in
number and size
since the prior study.
3. New multifocal pneumonia.

4. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left new, right decreased.

5. Trace ascites, stable.
MRI Head [**2188-1-24**]
1. Focus of restricted diffusion in the left insular lobe
cortex, which in the setting of endocarditis appears highly
concerning for embolic stroke.

2. An additional focus in the right corona radiata with normal
ADC map and FLAIR hyperintensity may represent a further focus
of more subacute chronicity.

3. There is no evidence abscess, hemorrhage or space-occupying
lesion.

Final Report
INDICATION: Increased shortness of breath. The patient's history
is
significant for bacterial endocarditis, with extensive pulmonary
septic
emboli, more recently with mitral and tricuspid valve
replacements.

intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images
are also
reviewed.
