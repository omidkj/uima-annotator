[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
PLEASE PERFORM AT 5PM [**2169-5-13**] - 66 year old man s/p
CABGx1(LIMA->LAD)Replacement of ascending aorta(32mm Gelweave
graft) [**5-8**], R CT placed for ptx [**5-8**]
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
PLEASE PERFORM AT 5PM [**2169-5-13**] - CT now clamped - ? interval
change
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW ON [**5-13**]

HISTORY: Chest tube clamped, question interval change.

The right lateral lung and chest wall are off the film. Again
seen is subcutaneous emphysema, more marked on the right than on
the left. No pneumothorax is identified. Compared to the prior
study, there is no significant interval change.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Markedly dilated ascending aorta.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Mildly dilated descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Suboptimal image
quality - poor echo windows. The patient appears to be in sinus
the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is markedly dilated The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of
the results in the operating room before the surgical incision.
Post_Bypass:
Patient has mild RV global dysfunction. (On epinephrine 0.03
mcg/kg/[**Last Name (un) **] infusion)
Ascending aortic graft is intact.
Trace AR. Mild MR. Mild to Moderate TR.
LVEF 50%. (mild global hypokinesis).


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**5-8**] where he underwent a
CABG x 1 and replacement of ascending aorta. He was transferred
to the ICU in stable condition on epinephrine, neo and propofol.
He was found to be hypotensive and hypoxic with absent breath
sounds on the right. CXR confirmed a large right sided
pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed. He progressed on the
usual post-op course, diuresed, beta blockers started and
increased.  He remained with a prolonged air leak, which
eventually resolved on POD # 5.  On [**5-13**] (POD # 5), his right
pleural tube was clamped, a CXR revealed no pneumothorax, and
the tube was removed.  Subsequent CXR showed no ptx, and he is
ready to be discharged home with VNA.
