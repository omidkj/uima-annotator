Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10293**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for TIPS evaluation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 yo male with ETOH cirrhosis, portal HTN, UGI
bleeding, CHF, COPD and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatic
hydrothorax s/p CT placement for [**Hospital 73974**] transfered from an OSH on
[**2136-9-6**] for TIPS. Patient was initially admitted [**8-18**] at an OSH
for hematemesis and found to have a bleeding ulcer that was
cauterized per Endoscopy. He subsequently developed SOB and
notable plueral effusions. He was treated with steroids,
prednisone 60mg daily with a taper, and a course of
levofloxacin. He underwent a thoracentesis c/b R sided PTX
requiring chest tube placement at OSH, which persistently
drained ~1L fluid/day. During that admission he did receive 4
units of PRBC. His BP notable for range 80s-90s with difficulty
continuing BB for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to
persistently low SBP. Cardiology followed pt and rec continuing
low dose nadolol and aldactone. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**9-6**] for possible TIPS due to persistent Chest tube output
related to hepatic hydrothorax.
.
The patient was originally admitted to the medicine floor and
was evaluated by hepatology who decided he cannot undergo TIPS
due to mod pulmonary hypertension with PA pressure 47 mmHg, also
found mod to severe AS, mild AR and TR, mild to mod MR, and may
require pleuridesis. He triggerred 3 times on the floor for
persistent tachypnea, O2 Sats stable as well as for low BP in
the 80s, despite baseline SBP 80s-90s. He had low grade temps,
with plueral fluid growing GPC in pairs and clusters with Urine
growing coag neg staph. He did not receive any Abx on the floor.
Was transferred to MICU on [**2136-9-10**] for tachypnea and "nursing
concern".
.
While in the ICU, cultures from the OSH pleural fluid (right
side) grew MRSA and felt to be consistent with an empyema. He
was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn. He continued to spike
fevers. Blood and Urine also then grew out MRSA. The Zosyn was
d/c'd on [**9-11**]. He was continually note to have a large left
pleural effusion and there was concern that it was also
infected. On [**2136-9-11**] he had a left thoracentesis that drained
1400cc (non-purulent). He was transferred back to the floor
after respiratory status stabilized.

IMAGING:
[**9-7**] US of liver w/ doppler: The main portal vein is patent and
there is no evidence of cavernous transformation. The right
middle and left hepatic veins are also patent. There is no
perihepatic ascites. The pancreas and abdominal aorta are not
visualized. The spleen is borderline enlarged at 12.9 cm. The
gallbladder is not visualized.
The left kidney measures 12.7 cm in length and contains a 6.9 x
4.4 x 4.9 cm simple appearing exophytic cyst in the interpolar
region. The right kidney measures 12.4 cm in length. There is no
evidence of hydronephrosis in either kidney.
.
[**9-7**] ECHO: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. PASP 45mmHG.
.
[**9-9**] CXR: Similar to earlier CXR with Stable right pleural
effusion. Stable retrocardiac opacity likely reflects underlying
small- to moderate-sized pleural effusion with atelectasis,
difficult to exclude pneumonia.
.
[**2136-9-10**] LENI - No DVT identified in the left lower extremity.
.
[**2136-9-14**] Abd US: IMPRESSION:
1. Limited Doppler examination, but unobtainable flow in the
portal vein with hepatic arterialization suggests very low flow
within the portal system or possibly occlusion.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Cirrhosis, trace fluid about the liver, and splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 65 yo male with ETOH cirrhosis, dCHF, AS, initially
transferred from OSH with UGIB and hepatic hydrothorax s/p
thoracentesis c/b PTX with chest tube in place, for TIPS. Went
to MICU for respiratory distress and hypotension, found to have
a MRSA empyema and MRSE bacteremia.
.
.
# Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of EtOH cirrhosis c/b
hepatic encephalopathy in past presenting with hepatic
hydrothorax. He was initially transferred for TIPS procedure,
but he was not a suitable candidate due to comorbidities of
pulmonary HTN and severe AS. He was maintained on lactulose,
nadolol, diuretics, and MVIs for medical management of his liver
disease while in-house.
.
# Empyema: patient with empyema (growing MRSA) on right, with
chest tube in place to water seal. He was also treated with
thoracentesis x 2 on the left: both times large output (>1L),
transudative on labs, with gram stain showing no organisms. The
MRSA empyema was treated with vancomycin in house; however,
there was little clinical improvement on this medication.
Thoracic surgery consultatation recommended that no surgical
intervention (i.e. VATS) was possible. Interventional
pulmonology was able to place a  Pleurex catheter to R sided
empyema with much output during hospital course. This was
ultimatey discontinued when the patient's clinical status failed
to improve and he was treated with comfort measures.
.
# Bacteremia/UTI: On admission blood and urine grew coag
negative staph. treated with vancomycin. Subsequent cultures
([**9-13**] onwards) yielded no growth.
