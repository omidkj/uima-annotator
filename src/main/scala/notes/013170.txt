History of Present Illness:
54 yo female with hx of polysubstance abuse, HIV, and recurrent
knee and chest pain presents with knee pain and confusion.

was performed which revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis and she was
started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. Labs revealed

screen positive for opiates and cocaine. Her only complaint at
this time is rt knee pain. She denies fever, chills, neck
stiffness or photophobia.

.
Pelvic XR
IMPRESSION: Small radiodensities over the left pelvis annot be
localized on this single projection, but are likely vascular
calcifications
.
Knee XR
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or dislocation. Extensive
degenerative change of the lateral compartment as above. Small
right knee joint effusion
.
Admission CXR
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
CT Head
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. No significant change from [**2129-1-1**], including small subtle
low attenuation focus of the left frontal periventricular white
matter consistent with remote lacunar infarct.
.
R knee CT scan:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive erosive changes and destruction of the lateral
joint compartment of the knee with relative sparing of the
medial compartment and patellofemoral compartment. These changes
have steadily progressed dating back to previous radiographs
from [**2129-5-8**]. The most likely etiology would be an low
grade infectious process and given the HIV status of the
patient, atypical infections (TB, fungal) should be considered.
Other inflammatory arthropathies and synovial proliferative
processes such as rheumatoid arthritis, PVNS and gout also
should be considered.
2. No evidence of fracture.
3. Small loose bodies within the joint space. Large, joint
effusion.
.
TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler  and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal
limits). The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 54 yo female with hx of polysubstance abuse, HIV, and
recurrent knee and chest pain presents with knee pain and
confusion. s/p tap of R knee.
.
Mental Status change-Most likely etiology is cocaine overdose.
Believe elevated CK on admission was from cocaine as well.  Head
CT negative, no trauma.  Lymphocytic pleocytosis on LP not
concerning for bacterial meningitis and CSF did not grow
bacteria. TSH was checked and was low but T3/4 were normal.  Can
recheck as outpatient.  Mental status was back to normal by time
transferred to floor [**2131-2-28**].
.
Knee effusion- s/p arthrocentesis, no crystals on analysis of
joint fluid.  No evidence of septic joint.  C/w hemarthrosis
