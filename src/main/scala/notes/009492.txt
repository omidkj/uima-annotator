notable for intial lactate 3.9, WBC of 42.6 and Cr of 4.4. K of
6.4 for which patient received calcium, insulin, bicarbonate,
and D50. Urinalysis notable for positive WBC and leucocyte
esterase. Pt received IV levofloxacin. Attempt at subclavian
central line unsuccessful, L femoral CVL placed.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 year old woman with Down's Syndrome, Alzheimer's
dementia, diverticular disease admitted with sepsis evidenced by
hemodynamic instability, high grade leucocytosis, lactic
acidosis and associated with renal failure and hyperkalemia,
Initially required Levophed, 100% FM. She is DNR/DNI.  She was
started on broad spectrum antibiotics including linezolid,
zosyn, and flagyl  The sources of infection appear to be UTI
secondary to proteus infection and RLL PNA given high amount of
secretions.  Given sensitivities of the proteus organism,
antibiotics were narrowed with vancomycin replacing linezolid
and continuation of zosyn.  She finished 10 days of flagyl.
.
The patient improved hemodynamically with pressors being weaned
off on hospital day 4.  Her acidosis and renal failure also
improved quickly.  She continued to have secretions and needed
oxygen support.  Secretions resolved fairly well by HD 7, she
continues to require oxygen support of 50% face mask.
.
In summary this is a 72 year old woman with Down's syndrom and
dementia admitted for sepsis secondary to proteus UTI and/or
pneumonia.  Sepsis is resolved.  She is DNR/DNI.  She has been
hemodynamically stable for over a week although she continues to
require oxygen support via facemask.
.
Issues and plan summarized below:
.
1) Sepsis: likely source UTI (from proteus) and PNA. metabolic
acidosis and renal failure reversed quickly at admission.
- volume repleted
- Levophed gtt off since [**12-28**]
- Vancomycin day 5, Zosyn day 11
- Completed steroids started [**12-27**] for continued pressor
requirement and inadequate [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim (total 5 days; ended [**11-30**])
.
2) Resp distress: likely from thick secretions from PNA,
secretions improved, continues to need oxygen support
- antibiotics as above.
- albuterol, mucomyst, added pulmicort
- chest PT, frequent suctioning
- lasix given cautiously as patient had been fluid overloaded.
.
3) Acute renal failure, now resolved after fluid resuscitation;
likely was from severe dehydration.
-hyperkalemic on admission, rec'd calcium/insulin/D50, now
resovled
.
4) Question adrenal insufficiency.
-was given steroids for continued adrenal insufficiency and
blunted [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim response (although [**Last Name (un) 104**] level was already high
in 30's)
-no need for steroids, consider repeat [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim
.
5) Hyperglycemia
-used regular insulin sliding scale while septic and on steroid
replacement
-likely does not need insulin any further, consider A1c level if
question of continued high glucose.
.
6) osteoporosis
- Continue Calcium, vitamin D
.
