Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 603**]
Chief Complaint:
right-sided hemiparesis and expressive aphasia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p IA tPA, MERCI clot retrieval

History of Present Illness:
      This is a 64 year old gentleman with a history of COPD,
CHF with EF 20% who was medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] with med flighted
[**7-14**] for R sided symptoms of aphasia, R facial droop and upper
extremity hemiplegia. He was found to have a L hyperdense MCA
with occlusion of the M1 branch and a significant perfusion
mismatch on CTP. L MCA stroke on [**7-14**]. He was intubated and
underewent IA TPA and taken to ICU where he underent
intra-arterial clot retrieval ([**Hospital1 17436**] procedure). After this
procedure, he was extubated and found to have aphasia and mild R
sided weakness. He was transferred from the SICU to the
neurology service. His course was marked by continued aphasia
but the patient did appear alert. He was transferred to Medicine
for tachypnea/hypoxia likely due to severe [**Last Name (un) 6055**]/[**Doctor Last Name 6056**]
respirations and central apnea. From [**7-19**] -[**7-21**] he was noted to
have an acute elevation in his liver enzymes. On [**7-21**], MICU
consulted to evaluate for progressively worsening LFTs and
difficult to assess mental status and he was therefore
transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU he has been monitored. His LFTs have trended down
without specific intervention (peaked at AST 3400, ALT 1848.
felt to be [**3-4**] shock liver. hep serologies negative, anti-smooth
muscle neg, [**Doctor First Name **] negative, SPEP neg)
.
He has continued to have severe Cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respirations with
oscillatory periods of tachypnea to the 40's, then hypopnea with
RR 0. He tends to have SaO2 of 100% when he is apneic, then his
sats drop as low as 80% as he begins to be tachypneic. During
these episodes he looks very dyspneic causing great RN concern;
he always starts breathing on his own and requires no
stimulation or treatments. Sleep consult is following him and a
study is planned, but no specific intervention has been needed
for his respiratory problem (he has even refused 2L n/c oxygen).

.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] has an EF of 20%. For CHF he was on dobutamine for a
few days, then he was weaned off and started on metoprolol.
Today the team diuresed him 1.2L. He has had frequent NSVT
lasting up to 10 seconds (asymptomatic, no ICD shocks)
.
His mental status has been stable with waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] alertness.
He has had some agitation, responding well to haldol.

CT/CTA head and neck/CTP [**2158-7-14**]:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Acute infarct involving left caudate, putamen and globus
pallidus, with
larger region of surrounding ischemia in the left MCA territory
that is incompletely imaged on CT perfusion.
2. CTA shows occlusion of the M1 segment of the left MCA and
partial occlusion of the A1 segment of the left ACA.
3. Findings consistent with occlusion of the right vertebral
artery at its origin.
4. Mediastinal lymph nodes and multiple small nodular opacities
in the
visualized lungs incompletely assessed. Non-emergent dedicated
CT chest
recommended for further evaluation.
5. Multilevel degenerative disease along c-spine, with narrowing
of the
spinal canal at multiple levels.
.
Non-contrast CT head, [**2158-7-14**] at 7 am:
IMPRESSION: Hyperdense material along the left medial temporal
lobe and left internal capsule may represent enhancement of
ischemic tissue versus hemorrhage.
.
Non-contrast CT head, [**2158-7-14**] at 8 pm:
IMPRESSION: Interval evolution of left MCA infarct. Interval
decrease in
hyperdensity in the left thalamus, with new foci of hyperdensity
in the left caudate nucleus. Subtle new hyperdensity in left
anterior basal ganglia region could be due to petecheal
hemorrhage within evolving MCA infarct.
.
Transthoracic ECHO [**2158-7-14**]:
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction. EF=20-25% [**2-1**]+ mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension. No LV thrombus seen.
.
EKG [**2158-7-14**]:
Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular pacing.
Ventricular ectopy.
.
EKG [**2158-7-19**]:
Sinus rhythm with atrial sensed and ventricular paced
Ventricular premature complex
Left atrial abnormality
.
CXR [**2158-7-14**]:
FINDINGS: AICD. moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly. Diffuse mild
interstitial opacities bilaterally, most predominantly in the
lung apices in which pulmonary edema is favored over chronic
lung disease, however, interpretation limited by lack of
comparison. No effusion or pneumothorax.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
    Pt arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] at 2:25am. The patient's NIHSS was 7 (-2
questions, -2 aphasia, -1 dysarthria, -1 right facial droop, -1
extinction to light touch on the right side). As CTA of head and
neck showed a proximal cutoff of the left MCA which extended to
the bifurcation of the left MCA, pt was intubated and taken to
the Angio suite at 3:55am. The penumbra device was tried first
but was unable to open the
left M1. Then the MERCI device was deployed and the left M1 was
successfully recanalized, and the pt was transferred to the SICU
for further care
.
Hospital course by issue:
.
1) Neurologic: After undergoing IA tPA and MERCI clot retrieval,
the patient was brought to the neurologic ICU by protocol.
Although no thrombi were visualized on Echo, an embolic etiology
was thought
