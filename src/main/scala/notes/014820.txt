Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 17862**] is a 77 yr old woman with history of
hyperlipidemia, COPD and asthma who presented to the [**Location (un) **] ED
with crushing chest pain starting [**2165-3-13**] at 1130pm and ending
at 6am today after taking sudafed. She was found to have
inferior Q waves on EKG with trop of 14 and CK 948. She was
started on a heparin drip, aggrastat, full dose aspirin, and
plavix loaded, and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
catheterization. Her vitals on transfer were temp 97.7, hr 96
sinus, bp 143/83, rr 16 sating 97% on RA.
.
On admission, she had a cardiac cath that showed tight OM1
disease.  She had POBA with 1.5mm balloon.  She had an angioseal
in her right groin.  During the procedure, she had transient
hypotension on NTG that resolved with 0.5 mg atropine.
.
On the floor, she had two further episods of hypotension with
blood pressure going to 54/37.  HRs were 105-119.  She had
nausea and emesis.  The emesis was light brown and gastrocult
positive.  She was given atropine 0.5 mg x 2 and 3 L NS.  A STAT
Echo was performed which showed normal RV and LV function.  A
non-contrast CT showed right RP bleed.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she complained of nausea.  She denied
lightheadedness, chest pain, dyspnea.

STUDIES:

CARDIAC CATH: PTCA COMMENTS:
Initial angiography revealed subtotal occlusion of OM1 distally.
We planned to treat this with PTCA only. Aspirin, plavix,
heparin and integrilin were given prophylactically and a
therapeutic ACT was confirmed. A 6F XB LAD 3.5 guiding catheter
provided adequate support for the procedure. A Choice PT ES wire
crossed the stenosis with some difficulty. The lesion was
dilated with a 1.5x9mm Maverick balloon at 6, 10 and 10atms.
Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI III flow. A 6F
Angioseal closure device was deployed across the right CFA
arteriotomy site. The patient left the lab free of angina and in
stable condition.

COMMENTS:
1.
2.
3. Successful POBA of the OM1 with a 1.5x9mm Maverick balloon.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and TIMI III flow (see PTCA
comments).
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful PCI of the OM1.
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate-sized acute right-sided retroperitoneal hemorrhage
which is seen tracking along the right paracolic gutter and
dependently layering in the presacral space.
2. Superimposed patchy opacification in right lower lobe over
chronic interstital process could relate to infection or
aspiration.
3. Moderate-sized hiatal hernia.
4. Diminutive size of the spleen and relative flattening of the
IVC can be seen in setting of known hypotension.
.
TTE [**3-14**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
TTE [**3-15**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2166-3-14**], no major change.
.
CXR [**3-15**]:
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs: There is a severe distortion of pulmonary
architecture with marked scarring upper lobe retraction large
cystic cicatrices throughout the lungs and right perihilar
opacification. Interpretation of the significance of these
findings would depend upon comparison to prior chest imaging,
but all the abnormalities could be stable over many years due to
scarring from sarcoidosis or a combination of emphysema and
pneumoconiosis. The asymmetric appearance of the hila, with
opacity marginating the lateral aspect of the right is the
radiographic finding of most concern, and could be pneumonia or
adenopathy, as well as conglomerate scarring.

A scan of the abdomen showing the lower chest, on [**3-14**]
showed no right pleural effusion so the right pleural
abnormality is thickening not fluid, but also showed an 8-mm
partially ground-glass nodule in the right lower lobe (2:3) and
a moderate hiatus hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 F with COPD/Asthma, HL presented with recurrent vasovagal
episodes following POBA to diag for NSTEMI.
.
# HYPOTENSION:  Patient had an RP bleed on CT likely related to
intervention.  Hct went from 40 to 24.  The hypotension,
however, was also vasovagal in nature.  Other potential sources
for hypotension include septic and cardiogenic shock.  However,
she was afebrile and echo did not suggest cardiac source.  RV
failure from IMI would make her very preload dependent. Patient
was transfused 2u pRBC, and her hct stabilized.  No vascular
procedure was required for the RP bleed.

# CORONARIES:  Patient presented with NSTEMI, attived with
inferior qs, 8 hours after onset of chest pain.  She is status
post POBA to Diag.  Integrallin and heparin were stopped given
RP bleed.  Patient was started on aspirin and plavix once RP
bleed stabilized.
