CTH: [**1-22**]: Large area of hypodensity seen on the left side
consistent with evolving left MCA territory infarct. No evidence
of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CTA: [**1-22**]: no evidence of basilar artery thrombosis.
interlobular septal thickening at lung apices concerning for
CHF.
right thyroid nodule; clinically correlate.
multiple small collateral veins noted in neck.
final read pending 3d reconstructed images.

CXR: [**1-22**]: 1. Endotracheal tube with tip approximately 3 cm
above the carina.
2. Nasogastric tube with tip projecting over the stomach, this
should be advanced so that the most proximal side port is within
the stomach. Discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at the time of this
dictation.
3. Mild CHF slightly increased compared to prior study.

CT chest/abdominal/pelvis: [**1-22**]: 1. Limited study secondary to
lack of IV contrast. However, given these limitations, no
definite evidence of acute intra-abdominal process.
2. Mild interstitial edema likely from CHF.
3. Large left renal stone, increased in size compared to [**2166**],
with urothelial and peripelvic inflammation.

CTH: [**1-22**]: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
There is hypodensity, loss of sulci, and loss of grey/white
differentiation in the left middle cerebral artery territory.
This most strongly suggests an acute left MCA infarction.
Corellation with MR imaging or CT perfusion may be helpful.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage. There is faint hyperdensity
of the left MCA M1 segment, but not sufficient to be certain of
thrombosis.

EKG: [**1-22**]: Atrial paced, ventricular sensed rhythm. Left axis
deviation. Q-T interval prolongation. Non-specific inferior T
wave abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-11-16**]
atrial premature beats are no longer seen. The Q-T interval is
longer.


Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: CT demonstrating evolving LMCA infarct.  pt with infarct
on ASA.  pt with history of refusing coumadin [**1-6**] adverse GI sx
- documented repeatedly by PCP and primary cardiologist.
Concern for poorer exam on [**1-28**]. CTH stable on [**1-28**].  pt with
alkalosis, thought to be contributing to her exam.  Pt more
awake on [**1-30**] with improved alkalosis.  Follow up head CT on the
day of discharge showed normal evolution of the left sided
infarct with minimal hemorrhage.  The patient was started on
heparin gtt with a goal PTT of between 40 and 60.  She was
subsequently started on coumadin.  Her most recent INR was 1.5.
She has a goal range of 2 to 3.

CV: pt's BP's stable on atenolol at half dosing.  TTE without
clot/vegetation, TEE: Spontaneous echo contrast in LA/LAA with
depressed atrial appendage emptying velocities. No ASD/PFO seen.
No vegetations seen.  with findings, anticoagulation started
with heparin gtt. pt therapeutic on heparin.

Resp: ABGs stable.  extubated without incident.  pt with stable
ABGs after extubation

ID: The patient was febrile with GPCs in pair/chains growing
from blood (<24 hrs of growth).  She had tried keflex and
bactrim for cellulitis without complete resolution of infection
of RLE.  Vancomycin was started [**1-22**] with enterococcus growing
from blood X 2.  Per ID the patient was swithced to amp/gent
with amp sensitive organism.  The patient should complete 4
weeks of antibiotics.  Her course of appropriate coverage
started on [**2170-1-25**] - last day
