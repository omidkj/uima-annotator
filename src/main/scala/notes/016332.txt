History of Present Illness:
71yo woman w history of dementia, seizure d/o, DM, hyperchol
comes in from OSH after presenting with hypoxia to mid 80s% in
NH.  She has had increasing R>L lower ex leg edema x10d.  Also ?
PNA so reportedly treated with antibiotics x10d.  Last night
noted some wheezing.  Also rx with lasix for the last 3d.  Today
she was found hypoxic to the mid 80s w RR >30 so sent to OSH ED.
 There a CTA showed massive bilat PEs with involvement of the
main pulm arteries bilaterally.  There was marked RH strain.
Extension of clot into bilat lobar arteries.  She was started on
heparin gtt with bolus and sent here for management.
.
In the ED: VS: 96% 2-3L, SBP 90-110.  EKG showed RBBB with
S1Q3T3 and TWI V1-V4.  Labs with positive UA and elevated
Troponin.  Head CT showed mass likely c/w meningioma.  Heparin
was on hold for PTT 131.  Transferred to ICU for management.
Received ceftriaxone.
.
Currently, she is nonverbal and appears in no distress.  Spoke
with family who requests DNR DNI.  Family also says that left
upper ex has been edematous.

EKG: RBBB with S1Q3T3 and TWI V1-V4
.
Head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or CT evidence
of infarction. Right frontal extraaxial lesion, most likely a
meningioma. Ventricles are dilated, raising concern for
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
LENIs: 1. Bilateral lower extremity DVTs extending from the
common femoral to the popliteal veins bilaterally.
2. Very limited examination of the left upper extremity due to
technical
factors. If clinically warranted, this may be repeated.


Brief Hospital Course:
For her pulmonary embolus, patient presented with bilateral
mainstem bronchi pulmonary emboli and DVTs. Patient had evidence
of hemodynamic compromise on EKG and with hypotension. We met
with family urgently to discuss code status and goals of care.
Patient's family requests DNR/DNI including no pressors or TPA
if indicated.  We treated her with heparin gtt and she remained
hemodynamically stable.  In the morning after admission, we
switched her to lovenox [**Hospital1 **].  She should remain on lovenox [**Hospital1 **].
She was initiated on coumadin but was unable to take oral
medications consistently with the nursing staff, so it was felt
that it would be safer with the clot burden to continue Lovenox
therapy for life. It is unclear why she developed the DVT/PE.
Consider workup malignancy as an outpatient to assess reason for
clot, if agreeable with goals of care.
.
Patient had a positive urinalysis and was given several doses of
ceftriaxone. Her urine culture was negative and this was
discontinued.
.
On head CT, she had evidence of a meningioma. The risks of
anticoagulation with a head lesion were discussed with her
family, and she was anticoagulated despite bleeding risk because
of the high risk of hemodynamic collapse from her pulmonary
embolus. She will need repeat CT of her head in [**2-9**] months to
evaluate progression. She was also noted to have communicating
hydrocephalus. This is of unclear clinical significance.
.
Her mental status improved with time. She was able to open her
eyes and follow some commands to voice on day of discharge.
.
She was DNR/DNI throughout her hospital stay. A discussion about
further management in case of further decompensation was
conducted with multiple family members present, with goal to
transition to a morphine drip if necessary. This should be
rediscussed with the family as well at the nursing home.

Discharge Instructions:
If you develop chest pain, cough, leg swelling, fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, or shortness of breath, please call your
primary care doctor or go to the emergency room.

You have a follow-up appt with your PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) **],[**Name11 (NameIs) 1575**] [**Name Initial (NameIs) **].
