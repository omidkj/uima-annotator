Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
Rigid Bronchoscopy on [**10-5**] and [**10-7**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 y/o F h/o anca positive vasculitis (Granulomatosis
with polyangitis) with pulmonary and renal involvement,
complicated by tracheobronchial disease with nodularity and
chronic lung collapse. She has had multiple endoscopic
procedures attempting to open her left main stem a stent placed
from [**2175-1-11**] with endobronchial steroid in the LMS due to
narrowing which was removed on [**2175-6-1**] with some temporary
improvement. She was most recently seen in pulmonary clinic
[**2175-9-26**] with inspiratory wheeze noted in the LLL with CT trachea
showing recurrent narrowing of the LMS. She went to the OR today
from home for rigid bronchoscopy with balloon dilatation,
electrocautery and intralesional steroid injection performed.
She arrived for the procedure on 5L 02 (typically only uses at
night) noted to be tachycardic). At start of procedure, left
main stem was noted to be occluded, some secretions. Had
cryotherapy performed with ablation of airway and biopsy left
mainstem lesion. Were able to open left lower lobe but did not
get good visualization of left upper lobe. 500cc IV fluid was
given during the procedure. Towards the end of the procedure she
became hypoxemic to 85% RA with low tidal volumes  and was
intubated with a 7.5french tube with propofol 50mcg/kg/min. Also
received fentanyl 25mcg for autopeeping. A CXR showed completed
left lung collapse. She subsequently became hypotensive with BP
to 69/49 and was started on phenylephrine at 2:30pm with 500cc
IVF fluid bolus x 2 given. She was started on vanc/zosyn for
post obstructive PNA. Unsuccessful foley placement attempt.She
was subsequently transferred to the ICU.

On arrival to the MICU pt intubated and sedated with VS stable.
Noted to have an A line and 2x 22 guage IV.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
