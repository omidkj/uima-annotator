Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Dilaudid

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-9-9**] Redo Bentall procedure ([**Street Address(2) 17009**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
AV/graft composite)/Hemi Arch aortic replace.(26 mm Gelweave)/
LVOT reconstruction ( pericardial patch)


History of Present Illness:
28 yo male with h/o bicuspid valve with aortic valvuloplasty at
age 15, MSSA endocarditis in [**2137**] (age 24) s/p AVR with a
homograft, and subsequent endocarditis in [**2140**] with AVR with a
mechanical valve, and h/o IVDU; p/w prosthetic valve
enterococcal IE.

The patient was slowly becoming more dyspnic over the past
several weeks. He usually is quite active at baseline, but has
noticed in the past week he has had difficulty walking to class
that has forced him to stop. On Thursday, the patient
experienced acute shortness of breath while sitting at home. He
called 911 and was taken to the emergency room in [**Location (un) **]. On
presentation in the ED, he had profound anemia with a Hct of
11.5. He was found to be in acute pulmonary edema as well. He
had a mild troponin I elevation of 0.37 with a BUN and Creatine
37/1.9 (BUN/Cr baseline 10-18/0.8-1.0). His white count was 8.1.

.
He was electively intubated secondary to respiratory instability
and respiratory acidosis. TEE on [**8-31**] revealed a large
obstructive mass in the ascending aorta, with prosthetic valve
AI, as well as aneurysm and dehiscence in the aorta. After the
TEE, blood cultures were sent, which eventually grew
enterococcus. He was started on Amp/Gent, diuresed and received
10 units of PRBCs. Patient's respiratory status improved and was
extubated [**9-2**]. He was transferred to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] for further
management and evaluation by CT surgery of repeat AVR.
.
Of note, he had a tooth filling in [**Month (only) 404**] and a re-do filling
in [**Month (only) 958**], of which he took antibiotics both times. He states
after [**Month (only) 958**], he started feeling ill. He c/o muscle cramps in his
thighs and increased palpipations. He denied shortness of breath
until the episode last week.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, vitals were T: 99.5 HR: 73 BP: 95/62
RR: 26 SpO2: 99% on 4L. He denied complaints, notably, denied
CP, SOB, dizziness, and palpitations.
.
On review of symptoms, he complains of left lower extremity
numbness and decreased pulses in DP/PT. He was followed by
vascular surgery in the OSH and no intervention was done.
.
He denies any prior history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough,
black stools or red stools. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
pnd, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or presyncope.

prior infarct, and minimal chronic microvascular ischemic
changes.
6. Chronic systolic heart failure

Social History:
Quit tobacco just prior to admission h/o [**2-9**] ppd for 12 years.
Denies ETOH over the last year. He currently lives with his
parents. Several years of IVDU but denies since last AVR.

Family History:
Patient adopted and does not know family history.

Physical Exam:
72"  90 kg
Blood pressure was 95/62 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 70
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 26 breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished and
well groomed. The patient was oriented to person, place and
time. The patient's mood and affect were appropriate.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. There is a 2x2mm scleral
hemorrage in the L eye. The neck was supple with JVP at
clavicle. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills or
palpable S3 or S4. Mild lift was noted. The heart sounds
revealed a normal S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs
or gallops. Harsh [**5-14**] crescendo/decresendo systolic murmur heard
best at the left sternal border on the clavicle; radiating to
carotids, apex, and back.
.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was
soft nontender and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor,
cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Inspection and/or palpation of skin
and subcutaneous tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers,
scars, or xanthomas.

ECG Study Date of [**2142-9-3**]:
Sinus rhythm. Rightward axis. Deep T wave inversions in leads
V1-V6 raise the possibility of ischemia, metabolic effect or
left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2140-3-19**] anterior and lateral T wave abnormalities are more
pronounced.

ART EXT (REST ONLY) Study Date of [**2142-9-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Severe left tibial disease, greater in the dorsalis pedis
than in the
posterior tibial artery.
2. Right ABI of 1.25 and the left ABI of 0.68 at rest.
3. Normal right lower extremity hemodynamics at rest.

MRI Head W/ and W/O Contrast ([**2142-9-4**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of small contrast-enhancing and
hemorrhagic lesions along the cerebral hemispheres and left
cerebellum, which may be cortical or leptomeningeal. Given the
clinical setting, they are consistent with septic emboli.
2. Interval increase in chronic infacts and chronic
microhemorrhages, likely due to recurrent emboli in the setting
of AVR.

Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT w/ and w/o contrast ([**2142-9-5**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Post-surgical changes with aortic graft and aortic valve
prosthesis.
2. Dilated ascending aorta measures up to 5.9 cm in diameter.
3. Cardiomegaly.
4. Small left pleural effusion.
5. Left basilar consolidation/atelectasis.
6. Splenomegaly.
7. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.
8. No CT evidence for aortoenteric fistula.
9. Air in the non-dependent portion of the urinary bladder may
be related to instrumentation. Please correlate clinically.

MRA Lower extremities ([**2142-9-5**]):
1. Aortoiliac station: The aortoiliac system is widely patent.
2. Left lower extremity: Embolic occlusion of the distal
tibioperoneal trunk, long segment of proximal posterior tibialis
artery, peroneal artery, distal anterior tibialis artery,
plantar arch and proximal dorsalis pedis.
