ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is
borderline right
ventricular hypertrophy. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral

regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired
relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

AP chest compared to [**11-15**] and 15:

The patient has been extubated. Lungs are moderately
hyperinflated, but aside from the left upper lobe mass, grossly
clear. Heart size normal. No pleural abnormality or evidence of
large central lymph nodes. Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified
but normal caliber. Heart is normal size.

US
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of both lower
extremities including the common femoral, superficial femoral,
and popliteal veins was performed. Normal flow, augmentation,
compressibility, and waveforms were demonstrated. Intraluminal
thrombus was not identified.

IMPRESSION: No DVT.

VQ scan:
IMPRESSION: Very low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary
embolism.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is no comparison. There is no
acute intracranial hemorrhage. There is no mass effect. No shift
of normally midline structure is noted. The ventricles are not
dilated. The osseous and surrounding structures are
unremarkable. Chronic small vessel ischemia.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No mass effect.
Please note that the MRI is more sensitive for the detection of
small metastasis in this patient with lung cancer.

CT chest/abdomen:
IMPRESSION:
 Again note is made of two subcentimeter low-density nodule in
the right thyroid gland unchanged since prior study.

1. Limited study due to lack of intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

2. 1.7 cm spiculated left lung cancer in the upper lobe, with
associated opacities in the left upper lobe and lower lobe, not
significantly changed compared to the prior study.

3. Smooth interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lungs,
especially in apices and right lower lobe, with diffuse increase
of interstitial opacity. The findings can be due to pulmonary
edema, however, lymphangitic spread of the tumor cannot be
excluded in this patient with lung cancer.

4. Slightly increased peribronchial thickening in lower lobes.

5. Unchanged low-density lesion in the left kidney, most likely
representing cysts.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hypercarbic/Hypoxic Repiratory Failure: She was initially rx'ed
empirically with vanco/levo for possible pna, hep drip for
possible PE, lasix for pulm edema and nebs for copd flare. Lung
scan low prob for PE and bilat lenis neg. CT with evid of pulm
edema and BNP in thousands. She was extubated on day 2. She was
transferred to the floor on O2, lasix. Echo ordered showed
normal LVSF and some pulmonary hypertension. Further assessment
for this ECHO to be deferred to the clinic provider. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient
was continued on CHF meds - ASA, plavix, lasix, beta blocker,
ACE inhibitor.
Home oxygen to be continued.

Hyponatremia on admission - resolved quickly with free water
restriction. This should be monitored as may develop into SIADH
like picture given h/o lung cancer.

Anemia: Stable Hct. Normocytic anemia. further work up per PCP.
