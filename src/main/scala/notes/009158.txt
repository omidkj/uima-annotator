History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 22yo male with PMH significant for mediastinal
germ cell tumor with airway obstruction s/p cycle 3 of cisplatin
& etoposide ([**Date range (1) 32684**])who presents for elective tracheostomy &
PEG tube placement. Patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**9-20**] after undergoing stent placement in the left mainstem
bronchus and Y stent placement in the trachea.
.
Patient initially presented to OSH in respiratory distress and
was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass on CXR, confirmed
by CT. Patient continued to desat from 80s to low 50s and was
eventually intubated. Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2171-7-22**]
per request of family. According to family, patient was in his
usual state of health until he started to have generalized
symptoms 6 months prior to presentation to OSH including sore
throat, cough, and respiratory symptoms. Patient had been
treated for 2 weeks for bronchitis without resolution.
.
At [**Hospital1 2177**], patient was intially intubated with double lumen ETT for
acute respiratory distress. Patient had multiple episodes of
desaturation requiring intervention with bronchoscopy for better
ETT positioning. On bronchoscopy, the anterior mass was noticed
to cause tracheal narrowing and obstruction of the mainstem
bronchi bilaterally. Patient's double lumen ETT was changed to a
single lumen on [**7-26**] for better ventilation. Course complicated
by bilateral pneumothoraces requiring bilateral chest tube
placement which were d/c'ed on [**8-24**] and [**8-25**]. Patient was
extubated on [**8-23**] but reintubation on [**8-30**] due to hypercarbic
respiratory failure. He was transferred at this time to [**Hospital1 18**]
for Y stent placement and then transferred back to [**Hospital1 2177**]. He was
extubated on [**9-21**] and initially did well but could not
adequately handle the secretions so he was taken to the OR on
[**9-27**] for tracheostomy by ENT. The procedure was technically
difficult since the Y stent was too high. He was reintubated
(nasotracheal tube) in OR with bronchoscopy to remove mucous
plugging in right middle and lower lobes.
.
He underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy of his anterior
mediastinal mass on [**7-23**]. Given elevated AFP (4093 on [**7-23**]) and
biopsy of undifferentiated carcinoma, patient was treated for
germ cell tumor with neoadjuvant cisplatin and etoposide from
[**Date range (1) 73635**]. Patient prophylaxed for TLS with alopurinol,
dexamethasone, and IV fluids. Chemotherapy complicated by
pancytopenia and neutropenic fever, requiring PRBC transfusions
on Neupogen. Cycle 2 of chemotherapy delayed due to development
of Pseudomonas sepsis and ARF. However, with stabilization,
patient underwent cycle 2 of carboplatinum and etoposide on
[**8-4**]. At the time of transfer, patient is reportedly at his
chemo-induced neutropenic nadir. However, Hct and platelets have
been stable.
.
From an ID perspective, following cycle 1 of chemotherapy,
patient was diagnosed with a VAP on [**7-28**] and was started on
vancomycin and cefepime. Both were continued with the addition
of fluconazole for neutropenic precautions following
chemotherapy. Cefepime was changed to Zosyn when patient's
sputum culture was (+) for Achromobacter on [**8-7**]. Patient then
developed an abscess in his R groin at the site of a prior line
which was I&Ded by surgery on [**8-16**] and was also the source of the
above mentioned MDR pseudomonas sepsis. Patient had pseudomonas
in blood, urine, and R groin abscess cultures. He completed a 15
day course of gentamicin and cefepime, despite nephrotoxicity as
pseudomonas in wound culture was only sensitive to Gentamicin.
Patient was then started on Vancomycin due to MRSA from R
quinton tip culture. Also started on Amikacin for Pseudomonas in
sputum and urine. Diarrhea started on [**8-17**]. C diff was negative x
3 and was thought to be secondary to chemotherapy. He was placed
on empiric Flagyl at this time. A CT scan was obtained on [**9-15**]
showing ileocecal thickening and ? typhlitis (necrotizing
enterocolitis) as well as some ? intusseception fo ascending
colon, although there was no evidence of obstruction. Patient
then had temp spike through above broad antibiotic coverage and
empiric caspofungin started on [**9-15**]. With persisting fevers
patient was continued on Cefepime, Amikacin, for pseudomonas in
sputum and urine.
.
[**Hospital **] hospital course was also complicated by ARF thought to
be secondary to pseudomonas sepsis and hypotension on [**8-8**].
Patient developed poor UOP and lasix gtt started with poor
response. Patient eventually required CVVH for volume overload
on [**8-11**] with 6L removal, and on [**8-15**] with 4L removal. R Quinton
placed in R IJ and patient was started on HD on [**8-17**]. Quinton
eventually clotted on [**8-25**] and he recent emergent dialysis
through a newly placed left femoral line. He then went to IR for
possible L quinton placement for HD, but was discovered to have
bilat DVTs in IJs which prevented placement. He eventually
responded to 140 mg IV lasix with good UOP on [**8-29**] and the L
femoral line was d/c'ed to prevent further infection. ARF
eventually resolved with normal Cr and good UOP.
