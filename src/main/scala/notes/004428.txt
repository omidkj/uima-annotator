Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3016**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea/vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
58 yo F with recurrent stage IIIA NSCLC s/p carboplatin and
pemetrexed on [**2108-12-26**] and recent admission here for
gastroparesis who presented 2 days after discharge from here to
[**Hospital1 1474**] with similar symptoms.

There she was treated symptomatically. Cardiac biomarkers were
checked and noted to be elevated, with a Trop T of 4.9, CK
normal, EKG normal.  Cards was consulted, and she underwent a
stress test that was negative. She was treated with 48 hours of
heparin.  Per nursing report, stopped heparin [**2-6**] 'dropping
counts' and concern for HIT.  No HIT antibody testing in
discharge paperwork. GI was also consulted and recommended
symptomatic treatment with no EGD necessary, given recent EGD.
She was transferred here for further management and concern for
possible brain metastases given intractable N/V.  Of note, she
had an MRI in [**11/2108**] for same concern, which was negative for
metastases.
.
She triggered on arrival to the floor here at [**Hospital1 18**] for HTN to
200/100 HR 110.  EKG unchanged.  HTN likely related to
N/V/abdominal pain.
.
She reported mild epigastric pain.  She was diagnosed with
gastroparesis in [**10/2108**] based on a gastric empyting study after
presenting N/V.  She states that she rarely eats because she's
afraid to.  She's lost ~ 20lbs.  She denies constipation or
diarrhea.
.
ROS:
Denies CP, SOB, palpitations, cough, HA, change in vision,
dysuria, myalgias or arthralgias. She endorses depressed mood.

Past Medical History:
Locoregional Recurrent NSCLC
-- [**8-/2103**] presented with several months of persistent
cough unresponsive to antibiotics.
-- [**10/2103**] Chest x-ray demonstrated a density in the left mid
lung, which was confirmed by a chest CT.
-- [**11/2103**] chest CT revealing a 1.8-cm left upper lobe
spiculated
mass with pleural extension consistent with a malignant
neoplasm.
She also had a 2.6-cm right adrenal mass thought to be a simple
adenoma as well as a 2.1-cm left lobe focus of nodular
hyperplasia in the liver confirmed on an [**2103-11-23**] MRI.
-- [**2103-12-7**] staging with PET CT showing increased activity in
the left upper lobe nodule.  Brain MRI at the time of diagnosis
was negative.
-- [**2104-1-14**], she underwent a left upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node dissection with pathology revealing
adenocarcinoma with bronchioalveolar features well-to-moderately
differentiated in a 1.5 cm tumor.  She had lymphovascular
invasion and one of three peribronchial lymph nodes was
positive.
There was also a tumor in the periaortic lymph node in the AP
window region giving her a T1 N2 stage IIIA nonsmall cell lung
cancer adenocarcinoma.
-- [**2-/2104**] She was treated postoperatively with one cycle of
paclitaxel and carboplatin, but was hospitalized post infusion
on
[**2104-2-22**] with chest pain, which was a ST elevation MI.  She
underwent emergent catheterization with a 60% LAD stenosis for
which she got a Cypher drug-eluting stent.  She did not receive
further paclitaxel chemotherapy, but was started on a regimen of
cisplatin and vinorelbine, which she received a single cycle on
[**2104-3-26**], which was complicated by a MRSA UTI as well as a
decrement in her creatinine clearance to 57 mL/min down from
over
100.
-- She subsequently declined any further chemotherapy and did
not
receive radiotherapy either.
-- She did not continue to follow with her oncologist, but got
periodic CT scans via her surgeon and PCP.
[**Name Initial (NameIs) **] [**2107-5-2**] CT with no evidence of recurrence, although a
small
nodule is noted in the left lower lobe measuring 3 mm, which had
not been reliably demonstrated on the prior study.  No
mediastinal adenopathy reported on the [**2107**] scan.
-- [**2108-10-21**] came to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with epigastric pain, emesis, and
dizziness.  She underwent an EGD with gastritis and gastric
emptying study consistent with gastroparesis.
-- [**2108-10-25**] CT which confirmed a new soft tissue abnormality in
the left mediastinum starting just distal to the aortic arch
associated with abnormal density surrounding the left main
bronchus posteriorly and small lymph nodes in the left hilum
suspicious for lung cancer recurrence.  She also had a small
pericardial effusion, a 2-mm right upper lobe nodule with
associated ground-glass opacity.  Again, seen was a 2.5-cm
adrenal lesion and a right hepatic lobe lesion.  She also
underwent on [**2108-10-25**] an MRI of her L-spine, which was stopped
for pain, but did not show metastatic involvement.  Anti-[**Doctor Last Name **]
antibodies were negative.
-- [**2108-10-26**], she underwent a bronchoscopy with EBUS, which
showed a station 4L lymph node positive for malignant cells
consistent with nonsmall cell cancer.  The left main stem
bronchus biopsy was only notable for bronchial mucosa and a
level
7 node was negative.
-- [**2108-11-7**] PET CT on [**2108-11-7**], which confirmed a PET avid
paratracheal soft tissue density with an SUV of 6.7; a left
hilar
mass along the left main stem bronchus, which was also PET avid
at SUV of 4.9; and a non PET-avid 6-mm right hilar lymph node;
and 3-mm right lower lobe subpleural nodule.  There was no FDG
avidity seen outside of the chest and her adrenal mass is non
PET-avid.
-- [**2108-11-17**] MRI Brain: Subtle enhancement in the left parietal
leptomeningeal area felt to represent a tiny vascular lesion
like
a cavernoma. There is also question of an enhancing lesion in
the
left cerebellum but without associated mass effect or edema.
-- [**2108-12-1**] Chest CT with slight interval increase in
adenopathy,
no new findings.
-- [**2108-12-26**] C1 of carboplatin/pemetrexed
-- radiation therapy at [**Hospital 1474**] hospital
