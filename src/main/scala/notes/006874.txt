Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
76 y m with PMH of Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira and
Methotrexate, diastolic heart failure, peripheral neuropathy and
atrial fibrillation with 2 months of progressive DOE with acute
worsening 2 days prior to admission at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on
[**2120-5-20**].
.
Patient and wife report that over the last several months he has
progressive shortness of breath with exertion. He denies PND or
orthopnea. His wife also notes that his fingers and toes had
become increasingly 'purple' over the last several weeks. He is
normally very active, doing significant amounts of yard work,
walking up a large [**Doctor Last Name **] on his property and does not normally
have significant shortness of breath. He denies fever/chills,
weight loss and night sweats. He does not wear oxygen at home
and has never been diagnosed with lung disease.
.
On [**2120-5-18**] patient was drinking water and reports that it 'went
down the wrong pipe' this was followed by an episode of severe
coughing and shortness of breath that did not resolve. He then
went to the ED at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital where he was noted to be
hypoxemic. CT showed diffuse interstitial changes thought to be
secondary to rheumatoid-associated lung disease. Labs were
significant for a normal WBC with 60% PMNs, XX% lymphocytes, 17%
monocytes and 4% eosinophils. He was started on high dose iv
steroids with improvement in his cyanosis and his comfort. He
did not receive any antimicrobials as he was not felt to be
infected. His echo revealed a normal EF of 55% with moderate to
severe TR and moderately elevated pulmonary artery pressures.
EKG showed an rate of 60 with old RBBB and right axis deviation.
Though his symptoms did improve, repeat CT showed worsening of
left lung process and patient was not able to be weaned off
oxygen. He was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for lung biopsy and
further evaluation and management.
.
Yesterday when seen by pulm consult resident, patient reports
that he is feeling fine and is without complaint. He is not SOB
at rest and he is breathing comfortably on supplemental O2. He
denies any tobacco use, chemical exposures, pets or recent
travel.
.
Last night, he was taken to the OR for a VATs and pulmonary
biopsy. He had biopsies performed of the lingula and LLL. He was
extubated post-op but then re-intubated for hypoxia and
increased work of breathing.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 76 M w/ pmh Rheumatoid Arthritis on Humira
and Methotrexate, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation
with p/w hypoxic respiratory failure s/p vats and Lingula/LLL
biopsy.
.
#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: He appeared to be stable on 3L
NC prior to the VATS procedure and per the OSH report, he
dramatically improved clinically (and his pulmonary infiltrates
improved) w/ steroids. Apparently he initally did well after
extubation but then had increased work of breathing and hypoxia.
It seems possible that he could have had flash pulmonary edema
vs aspiration that caused acute decompensation requiring
intubation. His CXR at the time of re-intubation looks
dramatically worse than the prior CXR altough we have already
been able to wean FiO2.
.
#. S/p VATS: Chest tube in place draining sero-sanguenous fluid.
Small PTX on am CXR
- would likely plan to d/c chest tube when drainage is < 100 cc/
24 hrs.
- appreciate thorasics input
- daily CXR to eval for worsening PTX
.
#. Rheumatoid arthritis:
.
#. Macrocytic Anemia: Unclear etiology.
- check b12, folate, iron studies
- trend for now
- guaiac all stools
.
#. CHF: Normal EF from OSH report but h/o diastolic dysfunction.
As a result, likely does not tolerate a rapid rate or severe
hypertension well.
- maintain excellent BP control
- rate control as below
.
#. Afib: on digoxin and metoprolol for rate control as an
outpatient and coumadin for anticoagulation.
- re-start coumadin per thorasics
- as no systolic dysfunction, would opt to d/c digoxin and rate
control w/ metoprolol for now
.
FEN: replete lytes prn
.
PPX: Sc heparin, bowel regimen prn, ranitidine
--
[**5-31**]
- path c/w UIP
- discussed with rheum: hold humira x2wk post vats, hold mtx
indefinitely
- staph from sputum sensitivities pending
.
ACCESS: PIV's
.
CODE STATUS: Presumed full
.
EMERGENCY CONTACT: Wife [**Name (NI) 14880**] [**Name (NI) 732**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 83370**]
.
DISPOSITION: ICU pending resolution of above
.
[**5-30**]
- Extubated, high O2 requirement, on 80% facemask
- CT placed to waterseal, PTX stable
- Weaned to 5L NC
.
[**5-31**]
- weaned steroid down to 60mg methylpred
- increased ptx on AM CXR but thoracics ok with keeping on water
seal
- attempted to reach outpt rheum - no answer from office. spoke
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] rheum attending here rec HOLD humira x2 weeks
post VATS, then may restart if no infection identified. would
HOLD mtx indefinitely and defer further tx choices to outpt
rheum
- path prelim c/w UIP, discussed with family
- vanc trough 7, increased to 1g [**Hospital1 **] from 750mg [**Hospital1 **]
- seen by speech and swallow failed swallow -> made npo
.
[**6-1**]
- increased PTX, changed CT to suction from water seal
- changed zosyn dosing
- MIE Q2H, chest PT
- NG tube placed, pulled out of position with question
aspiration event, replaced
.
[**6-2**]:
- desat to 70s up to 70% facemask PLUS nasal canula, but
subsequently weaned weaned down to 35% without NC
- afib with rvr got 5mg metoprolol with good response
- CT placed back to suction given inc. size of PTX -> waterseal
this AM
- Family mtg held, ok to reintubate, if reach point with little
hope of improvement, family will likely withdraw care
.
[**6-3**]
- chest tube put on waterseal again in AM, but ptx worse on
repeat chest film to returned to low wall suction
- restarted digoxin
- pulled out NGT
--------
[**6-4**]
-HR mainly in the 70-80s but occasional sympathetic driven
spikes to 140-150. continued dig 0.125mg daily and changed PO
lopressor to 5mg IV lopressor IV q4hrs
-patient desats with any slight movement, for the most part on
6L NC
-plan to call family regarding any need for intubation and they
will likely say to not intubate at this point, still full code
currently though
-I/O goal even, by 7 p.m. even
-changed CT to water seal, no real change in PTX, per thoracics
attg patient will need ple
