History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 97626**] [**Known lastname 174**] is a 68-year-old female with known
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.  She initially presented in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2177**] to the heme onc clinic with complaing of neck pain due to
bulky lymphadenompathy and CT scan revealed extensive
lymphadenopathy, more severe in the deep pelvis, but also
involved her paraspinal regions, retroperitoneum, inguinal
regions as well as porta hepatis.  She also presented with an
elevated creatinine, and kidneys were normal in appearance and
there was no evidence of hydronephrosis.  She also had a large
neck mass more prominent on the right side.  The patient
presented to clinic today with a report of decreased urine
output over the last few months and was noted to have elevated
creatinine over 7. She also had increased bilateral leg edema
over the past three weeks, dyspnea on exertion, and increased
fatigue. She denied mental confusion, shortness of breath, chest
pain, abdominal pain or any bloating.  Denied any fever, chills
or night sweats.  She was eating and drinking okay.  She
otherwise denied any
bleeding or bruising difficulties, any numbness or tingling in
her fingers or toes.  She's had some difficulty with ambulation
due to the edema amd is currently using a cane.
.
She was sent from hem/onc clinic to the ED.  In the ED, her
creatinine was significantly elevated (up to 8.1), CXR showed
L-sided effusion with atelectasis/failure.  She stated that she
has been feeling more short of breath of late and has woken up
at times SOB in the middle of the night.  She statedshe had more
confusion lately (difficulty with word finding) as well.  She
denied any chest pain, abdominal pain, decreased appetite,
fever, chills; she states that her urne has been decreasing over
the past few weeks (but she still makes urine).  She was
currently thinking about whether or not she wants to have
hemodialysis and/or chemotherapy for her lymphoma and is
admitted at this time for further management. This patient is a
[**Doctor First Name **] scientist and had refused any treatment in the past;
however, with support of her family she opted to commence
chemotherapy and was admitted to the heme/onc service.
.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring because of high
risk of TLS as she agreed to have chemotherapy initiated. In the
setting of her renal failure, hemodialysis was required during
chemotherapy to clear tumor lysis toxins and preserve renal
function during this time. She received the CVP (cytoxan,
vincristine, prednisone) regimen with daily hemodialysis without
complication. She was transferred to the medicine service for
monitoring for tumor lysis and for continued hemodialysis until
outpatient dialysis is arranged. At that time, she noted
increased confusion lately that is worse in the hospital but has
been improving in the past few days. She was tolerating a small
amount of renal prudent solid food and drinking nepro
supplements. She denied fever, chills, dysuria, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, or distention. She had intermittent
constipation. She denies any chest pain, cough, fever, chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
Acute Renal failure: The etiology of the acute renal failure is
unclear but likely lymphomatous infiltration, urate nephropathy,
glomerulonephritis, or acute tubular necrosis that may be
reversible after dialysis and reduction of her tumor burden. She
had a renal biopsy on [**2-9**] that showed glomerular sclerosis
consistent with end stage disease, likely from the lymphoma.
Urine lytes were consistent with renal pathology.  Renal
ultrasound was without signs of hydronephrosis.  The following
laboratory tests were performed: hepatitis serologies ne
