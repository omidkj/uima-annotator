Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4358**]
Chief Complaint:
Leg Swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
56 yo man with history of hypertension and diabetes who had
recent bilateral total knee replacements on [**11-24**] for
osteoarthritis presents with bilaterall swelling and pain in his
lower extermities.  Patient states that 2 days ago while at
[**Hospital 38**] rehab he developed [**5-17**] crampy pain and swelling in
his legs bilaterally.  Ultrasound at that facility showed
extensive clot burden in his common femorals extending to the
pelvis bilaterally.  He was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.  He denies any associated chest pain, SOB, DOE,
nausea or vomitting.  Per the patient he has not been very
mobile since the operation and has just reccently started
physical therapy.  His initiaiton was delayed by a
post-operative illeus and admission to [**Hospital6 33**] for
2 days after discharge from [**Hospital1 18**].  This has since resolved and
the patient is passing daily stools.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.6 102 121/77 20 98%.  Patient
had been receiving lovenox injections for 10 days while at rehab
and upon evaluation in the ED was noted to have a drop in his
platelets from 287 at discharge on [**11-29**] to 137 today.  CTA
chest demonstrated several bilateral segmental and subsegmental
filling defects with areas suggestive of infarction in the bases
bilaterally.  Vascular surgery was consulted and recommended CT
venogram of abdomen and pelvis which showed extensive thrombosis
of the left/right illiacs and common femorals.  Patient was
initially treated with heparin gtt until labs returned with the
drop in platelets as above.  Heme/Onc was consulted and
recommended treatment with argatroban for possible HIT and PFT-4
antibody in the AM.  Patient was admitted to the ICU for
assymptomatic sinus tachycardia to the 110s.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was afebrile, p 91, 111/62 on 2L
of NC, but sating 99% on RA.  Patient had no new complaints and
was breathing without difficulty.

[**2144-12-12**] LENI's:
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) **] of left common femoral, superficial femoral,
popliteal veins and calf veins was performed. There is a
partially occlusive thrombus within the left common femoral
vein. Note is made of two left superficial femoral veins. There
is complete occlusive thrombus within one of the two left
superficial femoral veins, the left popliteal vein, and
extension of clot burden into the calf veins.
.
Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral,
right superficial femoral, right popliteal and calf veins were
performed. There is complete occlusive thrombus within the right
lower extremity venous system.
.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral DVT with occlusive thrombus within the
left superficial femoral, popliteal and left calf veins as well
as right common femoral, right superficial femoral, right
popliteal and right calf veins. Partially occlusive thrombus
within the left common femoral vein.
.
.
[**2144-12-12**]: CTA Chest, CT Abdomen with contrast
.
CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Bilateral filling
defects are noted within the segmental and subsegmental levels
in the upper, middle and lower pulmonary vessels on the right
and the upper and lower lobe vessels on the left consistent with
acute pulmonary emboli. There is no evidence of pulmonary
hypertension or right heart strain. The remaining great vessels
and heart are unremarkable. The aorta is normal in caliber. No
pericardial or pleural effusion is present.
.
There is a small peripheral area of opacification within the
lingula and right lower lobe (3A, 61 and 2, 46) which may
represent atelectasis, however developing infarcts cannot be
excluded in the setting of pulmonary embolism. Airways are
patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.
.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, kidneys,
gallbladder and right adrenal gland appear unremarkable. There
is fatty atrophy of the pancreas which is otherwise
unremarkable. There is a 3.6 x 2.4 cm intermediate density mass
appearing to arise within the left adrenal gland (3B, 105). No
free air or free fluid. The stomach and loops of large and small
bowel are unremarkable. Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.
The IVC is patent.
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:
Expansile hypodensity consistent with thrombus is noted within
the right
common iliac vein just distal to the bifurcation extending all
the way into the external iliac vein as well as into the common
femoral vein. There is adjacent fat stranding. On the left side,
the left common, external, and internal iliac veins appear
patent. Thrombus is noted within the left common femoral vein
(3B, 169). Multiple lymph nodes are noted along the pelvic side
walls bilaterally which contain fatty hila, measuring up to
13-mm, non-specific. There is air within the bladder; correlate
with history of recent instrumentation. Scattered diverticula
are noted within the sigmoid colon. No free fluid.
.
Visualized osseous structures show multilevel degenerative
changes with no
focal lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli without evidence of right heart
strain.
2. Focal peripheral areas of opacification within the lingula
and at the
right lower lobe may represent atelectasis, however infarcts
cannot be
excluded in the setting of pulmonary embolism.
3. Indeterminate left adrenal mass measuring up to 3.6 cm.
Further evaluation
with adrenal CT or MR protocol on a non-emergent basis is
recommended.
4. Gas in the bladder; correlate with recent instrumentation
history.
