Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, somnolent, hypotensive


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
87 yo F with a history of hypertension, GERD, atrial
fibrillation (not anticoagulated), and advanced alzheimers
dementia who was noted to be more somnolent this AM and was
subsequently referred to the emergency department.  She is
apparently AAOx1 at baseline.

In the ED, initial vs were: T98.1 P116 BP93/57 R18 O2 sat
99%4LNC.  She appeared diaphoretic, tachycardic, and flushed.
Her temp was later found to be 102.4 rectally.  Lactate noted to
by 5.5 with a left-shifted WBC to 15.  CXR concerning for left
sided pnuemonia though urinalysis showed heavy leukocytes
concerning for UTI.  She received vancomycin 1000mg IV, and
pip/tazo, along with 3L of NS which dropped her heart rate to
the 90s, her lactate to 3.1, and bolstered her systolics to the
100s.  Of note, code status was clarfied with the daughter HCP,
and stands as full code despite a previous DNR order.  Prior to
transfer, VS were HR92 BP100/57  RR25  Sat98RA.

On admission to the ICU, her VS were T96.6 BP105/63 R24 Sat
97%RA.  Her English is very limited and could not recount the
details.  Her primary nurse was not available at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab,
but coverage mentions that she was recently treated for a UTI on
[**2198-5-6**] with cefpodoxime.  She developed cough on [**2198-5-10**], with
a negative CXR on [**2198-5-12**].  She was tired and weak yesterday with
decreased PO intake. She had increased somnolence this morning
with inability to feed herself or communicate with staff.  [**Name2 (NI) **]
revealing a WBC to 16.  She had a witnessed generalized tonic
colonic seizure (no previous seizure history) with convulsions
of the upper and lower extremity.  She was subsequently referred
to the ED.

ROS could not be ascertained.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- CXR ([**2198-5-24**]): Markedly limited study. There is suggestion of
extensive patchy foci throughout the left lung, which may
indicate an underlying pneumonia. If clinically feasible,
consider PA and lateral views in the radiology suite for more
sensitive and specific evaluation.

- CXR ([**2198-5-27**]): PORTABLE
Compared with one day earlier, a PICC line has been placed. The
tip overlies the right atrium. Please see wet read from
radiology resident, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12582**], recommending pullback by
approximately 3 cm. Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
change. No pneumothorax is detected.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2198-5-25**]**
   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2198-5-25**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old Russian speaking woman with dementia who presented
with fever, hypotension, altered mental status, and elevated
lactate in the setting of possible pneumonia and UTI. She was
hypotensive to the 80s, tachycardic, febrile, diaphoretic with
leukocytosis. All of these raised suspicion for sepsis.
Potential sources included left sided pneumonia (limited chest
X-ray and no respiratory symptoms) versus UTI based on abnormal
UA. Urine culture was negative.  She was fluid responsive with
aggressive hydration in the ED with improvement of the lactate.
She was treated with vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP and UTI.
Day 8 of 8 will be on [**6-1**].  She remained hemodynamically stable
with appropriate urine output for the remainder of the
hospitalization. She was noted to be somnolent prior to
admission with a possible generalized grand mal seizure. Her
sepsis offered an explanation of a toxic-metabolic
encephalopathy. She had no focal neurologic deficits and mental
status remained improved and stabilized at what seemed to be her
baseline.  She had an ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY on admission with
creatinine of 1.2 with unknown baseline, this improved to 0.7 at
the time of discharge.  Metformin held initially and restarted
at the time of discharge.  Antihypertensives held initially, all
restarted with the exception of HCTZ.  Her potassium was
continued as her K was 3.2 on discharge (given 60meq x 1 on [**5-28**]
then will continue 20meq daily).  Her potassium should be
checked in a few days (Friday [**2198-6-1**]) and POTASSIUM
SUPPLEMENTATION SHOULD BE ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY.  If her BP
remains stable and becomes elevated her HCTZ can be restarted.
