Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
atrial fibrillation, failed medical therapy

History of Present Illness:
This 50 year old male with a history of atrial fibrillation was
diagnosed in [**2154**] with congestive heart failure and
cardiomyopathy. Symptoms are disabling for him and he has had
recurrent episodes despite initial sinus rhythm.  His ejection
fraction has ultimately improved to 50%, but he failed
Flecainide/Dronedarone therapy and subsequently Multaq. He is
currently on Flecanide and Toprol XL and has had one episode of
fibrillation since [**Month (only) **], which lasted less than 12 hours. He is
thus referred for evaluation for mini-Maze procedure.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. No spontaneous echo contrast
in the body of the LA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Bidirectional shunt across the
interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal
LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no atherosclerotic plaque. Normal diameter of aorta
at the sinus, ascending and arch levels.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. There is a 0.5 cm mass that resembles a clot in the
left atrium at the junction of the left atrial appendage and the
coumadin ridge. 3D examination revealed this to be a fold of
tissue arising from the wall of the atrium. Ejection velocities
in the left atrial appendage was greater than 40 cm/sec. 3D
examination performed by Dr [**First Name (STitle) 6507**] and confirmed as native
tissue and not clot.

A small secundum atrial septal defect is present.

The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque . The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.

Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.

Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.

Post procedure the left atrial appendage has been ligated.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
