Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16063**] is a 74-year-old man with a history of lung
cancer s/p LUL lobectomy and radiation, bladder cancer with
radical cystectomy, history of CHF (no documentation by
echocardiography), and small bowel obstruction, who is
presenting with two weeks of fever and cough.  For approximately
two weeks, the patient has been experiencing cough, fevers, and
shortness of breath upon exertion. The patient's cough has only
occasionally been productive of sputum. His son and
daughter-in-law have also been sick lately with a cold-like
illness. The patient has not received an influenza or
pneumococcal vaccine this year. He has recently been
immunosuppressed on prednisone and azathiporine for ulcerative
colitis.  He reportedly also has CHF, but does not have
cardiology notes in our system, and has never been hospitalized
for his heart failure and does not take diuretics. The patient
has further not experienced any swelling in his lower legs over
the past two weeks.  The patient denies any changes to his GI
symptoms over the past two weeks.  His primary nephrologist saw
him today and noted that he was dyspneic with a saturation of
87% on room air and sent him to the Emergency Department for
further evaluation.

In the ED, the patient's initial vital signs were 100.9 118
133/66 36 95%. A chest X-ray showed a new opacity at the right
lung base, so the patient was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. He also received acetaminophen for fever. The
patient also had his systolic blood pressure drop to the high
80s, for which he was given 500cc bolus of NS. On transfer, his
vitals were manual BP 100/70 HR 76 reg temp down to 98.9po after
Tylenol and 02 sat 95% 2.5L NP

On the floor, the patient was dyspneic after getting up to use
the bathroom. The interview was primarily performed via the
patient's son. The patient was capable of answering short
questions without being short of breath. The patient also
complained of being cold.

Brief Hospital Course:
74yo Russian speaking M with h/o ?CHF (normal stress test [**2151**],
normal EF), lung cancer s/p LUL lobectomy and radiation, bladder
cancer s/p radical cystectomy, UC on Prednisone/Azathioprine
presented 1 wk ago with productive cough of green sputum,
fevers, and dyspnea on exertion for [**3-15**] wks, found to have PNA.
On arrival pt triggered for AFib/RVR to 140-150's given
Metoprolol IV x3 leading to hypoTN, given IVF's and became
hypoxic. Sent to MICU where RVR controlled with Diltiazem and
converted to NSR. Called out and was continued on treatment for
PNA, AFib and continued to improve.
.
1. Community acquired-pneumonia: Complicated by chronic
immunosuppression on Prednisone and Azathiprine. Presented with
productive cough and fever of 10 day duration, and likely
opacity at right lower lung base. The patient's son reports no
history of aspiration or choking. Treated initially for CAP with
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin; however given decompensation and
MICU admission, pt was broadened with Vancomycin. Completed 6d
course of Azithromycin, 7d course of Vancomyin, and 14 of
Ceftriaxone transitioned to Cefpodoxime to complete as an
outpatient.
.
2. AFib with RVR: On morning of arrival, pt with RVR to
140-150's with symptoms, and appeared unwell. Given nodal agents
that dropped his blood pressure, so given IVF's to maintain
pressure but then had some element of flash edema with hypoxia,
so sent to MICU where Diltiazem was initiated and converted him
to NSR. Called out, he was continued on Diltiazem, uptitrated,
and eventually converted to long acting. Pt still noted to have
paroxysms of AFib on the floor, symptomatic if very rapid to
>140, but tolerable if lower; lower rates were tolerated, and
overall AFib was controlled. Per discussion with son, and with
[**Name (NI) 16064**] of only 1, pt was only treated with ASA 325. On
discharge, home Atenolol was stopped in favor of Diltiazem, and
of note pt without known h/o low EF or infarct; had normal mibi
scan in [**2151**].
.
3. Hypoxia: Initially with 4-5L O2 requirement that worsened
prompting MICU transfer but by call out, this was eventually
able to be weaned down to RA successfully. Likely due to V/Q
mismatch from PNA and low reserve given s/p LUL lobectomy.
.
4. Ulcerative colitis/proctitis: Was on home mesalamine,
Prednisone, Azathioprine before admission and per discussion
with pt's GI Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**], these were all continued; Prednisone was
given 30 mg x3d, 20mg x3d, then 10 mg every other day per Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 679**] continued until he sees Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**] in follow up.
.
5. CHF: CHF listed on patient's problem list, but no evidence
based on TTE or Mibi. The patient is not on h
