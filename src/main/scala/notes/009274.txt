Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78 yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF,
? COPD presents from home with acute shortness of breath. He
reports drinking ETOH tonight, but denies aspiration. The
patient was found by EMS to not be able to talk in complete
sentences. His BPs were 220s/140s. He received nitro spray x 4
enroute with BiPAP with mild improvement.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 138 139/126 28 97% on CPAP. Initially
he was thought to have CHF exacerbation, so was treated with
morphine, nitro drip. He then was found to have a rectal temp of
103.6 and CXR returned with large RLL infiltrate. Nitro drip was
stopped and he was given 1300mg PR tylenol. He was then treated
for suspected aspiration PNA with vanc/levofloxacin/flagyl. ETOH
negative despite report of ETOH use tonight. He was maintained
on CPAP 10/5 now with FiO2 100%, satting 100%. After report was
given, attempt to titrate off non-invasive mechanical
ventilation was attempted given concern for autopeep with BPs in
the 80s. He was placed on NRB with adequate saturation, however
felt more dyspnea, thus non-invasive was restarted. He was given
a total of 2L NS for fluid resuscitation. 2 PIVs were placed.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient reports improvement in
symptoms. Does not remember the events of the night.

Imaging:
========
TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal-mid infero-lateral
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of Mild to moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen without clear evidence of mitral valve
prolapse or significant anterior mitral leaflet tethering. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
mild focal LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild aortic
stenosis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
CXR:
1. Opacification at the right base concerning for aspiration
pneumonia.
2. Diffuse haziness in the right lung likely due to asymmetric
edema, particularly as the patient was found lying on his right
side for a prolonged period of time.
.
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:
1. Gross aspiration seen with thin barium and penetration seen
with
nectar-thickened barium.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 87y/o gentleman with history of CAD s/p CABG,
CHF who was admitted to the MICU for hypoxic respiratory failure
that was likely secondary to CAP with possible aspiration event.
His respiratory status was stable, he was treated with
antibiotics, and he was discharged home.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: resolved.
Etiology was likely multifactorial due to aspiration vs
community acquired PNA with component of flash pulmonary edema.
Patient does have a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonias
which were thought to be due to his esophageal stenosis, GERD,
and nocturnal reflux. Aspiration was seen on video swallow.
In the ED, he was treated with morphine and nitro drip for a CHF
exacerbation and then found to have temp of 103.6 rectally.
Nitro drip was stopped and he was treated with vanco,
levofloxacin, and flagyl for aspiration PNA. He was maintained
on CPAP and transferred to the MCIU on a non-rebreather with O2
sats 93%. In the MICU, he was changed to azithromycin and
ceftriaxone and improved overnight to breathing comfortably on
room air. His legionella was negative and sputum sample was
contaminated. Because the patient woke up in the early morning
with acute dyspnea and had elevated BP on admission, flash
pulmonary edema was a concern as well and TTE was done which
showed mild MR, mild AS, mild focal LV systolic [**Last Name (LF) 20559**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
50-55% with an eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of mild to
moderate MR. This likely explains the unilateral pleural
effusion. For his pneumonia likely due to aspiration, patient
was changed from IV antibiotics to PO augmentin.  He was
discharged home with plans to complete a course of PO Augmentin.
 Was counseled about modified diet to prevent aspiration events.
 He will follow up with his PCP.
.
# Hypotension:  Resolved.
Was hypertensive per EMS which was treated with morphine, nitro
given in the setting of SIRS/sepsis.  Fluid resuscitated with 2L
IVF in the ED. Patient likely flashed in setting of hypertension
during REM sleep prior to admission. He remained normotensive in
the MICU and his carvedilol and lisinopril were restarted at
home doses.  His BP was reasonably controlled on the medical
floor as well.  His hypertension regimen was not adjusted; he
will f/u with his PCP after discharge.
.
# CHF: EF 50-55% on TTE this admission. As above, patient likely
had flash pulmonary edema in setting of hypertension prior to
admission, in addition to pneumonia. He had a unilateral pleural
effusion, but did not appear to be fluid overloaded on exam. He
was not diuresed and restarted on his home carvedilol and
lisinopril.
