Chief Complaint:
back pain, lower extremity numbness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, extubation
T3-T7 laminectomy and T3-T9 fusion

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100713**] is a 56 yo male with severe COPD and CAD who
presented with lower extremity numbness and worsening back pain
found to have T6 vertebral compression fracture with cord edema.
History was obtained from wife and from limited medical record.
Of note, patient fell 2-3 weeks ago down two stairs. He
subsequently underwent a CT scan at [**Hospital **] Hospital whcih
revealed "spots on his lungs, a problem with his spinal cord,
and a cyst on his tailbone." He was told at this time that he
was not an operative candidate and was discharged home. He was
seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**] this past Monday and was prescribed
Percocet for pain control. His wife reports that over the two
days prior to presentation, he had no appetite, and lost all
sensation in his lower extremities. He had also reported a
burning sensation in his chest and excruciating escalation of
his back pain. Review of systems is positive for urinary
incontinence and constipation but now bowel incontinence. His
wife reports that he had developed acute worsening of the mid
and low back pain that he had been experiencing for the past
year. He was taken to [**Hospital **] Hospital again for further
evaluation, and because their MRI was not functioning, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was intubated for MRI which showed T6
compression fracture with cord edema. An urgent Spine
consultation was obtained and urgent operative decompression was
recommended.
.
Patient was taken to OR, and T3-T7 laminectomy and T3-T9 fusion
were performed. Patient received 4 units PRBC's, 3 units
platelets in the OR. EBL was 1.5 liters. Two drains were placed
to posterior wounds, one superficial and one deep to fascia. He
arrived to SICU intubated, paralyzed, and sedated.

[**2102-7-5**] MRI T/L SPINE:
1. Acute severe T6 vertebral body compression fracture
associated with posterior longitudinal ligament injury, and
bulging of the posterior aspect of the vertebral body, causing
indentation of the spinal cord at this level. Associated
increased STIR signal in the cord likely represents edema
secondary to cord compression at this level. A small amount of
epidural hematoma is seen. There may be a small superior
fracture fragment which may be mildly retropulsed; CT may be
performed for confirmation if clinically indicated.
2. Mild compression deformity of T3 is chronic.

PATHOLOGY SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: epidural collection, left T6
vertebral body biopsy, right T6 Vertebral body biopsy.

[**Doctor Last Name 2336**]/mb????????????
DIAGNOSIS:
I)  Epidural collection (A):
Adipose tissue with blood and inflammatory cells.
No evidence of malignancy.
Multiple levels are examined.

II)  Vertebral body, left T6, biopsy (B):
Bone with reparative changes, and acute and chronic
inflammation, and changes consistent with fracture site.
Trilineage hematopoietic marrow.
Cartilage with degenerative changes.
Multiple levels are examined.
No evidence of malignancy.

III)  Vertebral body, right T6, biopsy (C):
Bone with reparative changes, acute and chronic inflammation,
changes consistent with fracture site.
Cartilage with degenerative changes.
No evidence of malignancy.
Multiple levels are examined.
.
CXR [**2102-7-5**]: The heart size is normal. Opacity over the medial
right apex likely represents underlying tortuous vessels. Lung
volumes are low accentuating the pulmonary vessels. There is
slight fullness in the vascular pedicle with increased
interstitial opacity consistent with mild volume overload. No
sizable pleural effusion is seen. No pneumothorax is identified.

IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with mild interstitial edema. No
consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
.
ECG Study Date of [**2102-7-9**]  8:48:48 AM
Sinus bradycardia. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities with
occasional
premature atrial contractions. Short P-R interval. No previous
tracing
available for comparison.

.
TTE [**7-11**]
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There is no pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 100713**] is a 56 yo male with severe COPD who presented with
T6 compression fracture, now s/p T3-T7 laminectomy and T3-T9
fusion on [**7-5**].
.
# Compression fracture: The patient had a T6 compression
fracture and was intubated for a T3-T7 laminectomy and T3-T9
fusion on [**2102-7-5**]. He was extubated the following day. The
etiology of the compression fracture was initially concerning
for malignancy vs. osteoporosis in the setting of chronic
steroid use. Gram stain/tissue culture of specimen obtained in
OR was negative for organisms and pathology showed chronic
inflammatory changes and was negative for malignancy,
sugggesting osteoporosis the most likely etiology. Once
extubated, the patient had a TLSO fitted per ortho recs
(activity as tolerated when brace in place) and PT worked with
him to get OOB to chair. His strength in his lower extremities
slowly improved (intact plantar/dorsal flexion, able to barely
resist gravity for hip flexion, knee flexion). He was started on
a morphine PCA initially for pain control, which was weaned off
when transitioned to oral pain medications with oxycontin and
oxycodone prn. He was also given an aggressive bowel regimen
given his narcotics. The patient should follow up with surgery,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**], as an outpatient in on [**2102-8-9**] and with his primary
care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 4223**], on [**2102-7-27**].

# Respiratory difficulty/COPD: The patient was extubated easily
the day after his procedure. He initially required CPAP but was
transitioned to h
