History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 40750**] is 52M with history of HIV on HAART, last CD4 count
875 viral count 2422, presenting with shortness of breath.  He
initially presented to his PCP's office today with complaint of
hematuria and was found to be hypoxic (80%) on room air.  The
patient reports that for the past couple of days he has been
short of breath.  He also reports associated fever, chills and
cough productive of greenish sputum and pleuritic chest pain on
the R.  Denies any abdominal pain, n/v, diarrhea, consipation,
dysuria, frequency, palpitations, headache.  He denies any
recent travel.  He lives alone in an apartment and is on
disability.

In the ED, initial vitals were98.1, 110, 127/81, 24, 91% on 4 L
NC.  ABG 7.33/76/64/42.  Patient was put on biPAP did not
tolerate it well but did have some improvement in oxygen
saturation.  He was then placed on a NRB 95%.  Repeat ABG
7.38/64/78/39.  Labs otherwise notable for WBC 29.4, PMN
87%,HCO3 38.  A CXR showed large widespread opacification of the
right mid-to-lower hemithorax with mass effect, suspected to
represent a pleural effusion at least in part, including a
possible large loculated component; widespread atelectasis or
pneumonic consolidation.  The patient was given ASA 81mg,
ceftriaxone 1 g, methylprednisone 125 mg, TMP-SMX 600 mg,
azithromycin 500mg.

CT chest showing large R effusion, likely empyema.

On arrival to the MICU, vitals were 97.6, 120, 157/82, 16, 95%
on NRB.

      RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup will be performed appropriate to the isolates
recovered from
      this site.
      WORK-UP PER DR [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Numeric Identifier 93438**]).
      BETA STREPTOCOCCUS GROUP C.    MODERATE GROWTH.
      ENTEROBACTER AEROGENES.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.
      ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII COMPLEX.    SPARSE GROWTH.
         "Note, for Amp/sulbactam, higher-than-standard dosing
needs to be
         used, since therapeutic efficacy relies on intrinsic
activity of
         the sulbactam component".
      HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE, BETA-LACTAMASE NEGATIVE.    SPARSE
GROWTH.
         Beta-lactamse negative: presumptively sensitive to

CXR: IMPRESSION:  Widespread opacification of the right
mid-to-lower hemithorax with mass effect, suspected to represent
a pleural effusion at least in part, including a possible large
loculated component; a mass could also be considered, in
addition to widespread atelectasis or pneumonic consolidation.

CTAP:IMPRESSION: [**8-17**] 1.  Large loculated right pleural
effusion; saccular bronchiectasis of the bilateral lower lobes
and consolidation of the right middle and right lower lobes with
heterogeneous hypoenhancement and rounded hypodensities that may
represent either the underlying saccular bronchiectasis versus
multifocal necrotizing pneumonia. 2.  Cholelithiasis without
