EKG: [**10-21**]- Afib at HR=67, LAD, LVH, ST depressions in V5-V6,

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: [**2176-10-5**] The left atrium is dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF=
30-40 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and
hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is
considerable beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate
(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
CARDIAC CATH: [**2176-10-7**] 1. Coronary angiography in this right
dominant system revealed diffuse calcified coronary artery
disease.  The LMCA had mild disease.  The LAD had widely patent
stents, and total occlusion of a moderate sized diagonal seen on
prior catheterization from [**2173-11-11**].  The distal 70% stenosis
of the LAD was unchanged versus prior.  The LCX had a widely
patent stent, and mild luminal irregularities.  The RCA was a
large vessel, with moderate calcification and serial 40-50%
stenoses.  There was a large RPL that had a 60% stenosis in the
mid-vessel, which was
unchanged compared with prior.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate-to-severe aortic
stenosis with mean gradient of 18 mmHg and estimated aortic
valve area of 1.0 cm2. There were elevated left and right-sided
filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 15, mean PCWP of 35
mmHg, and LVEDP of 29 mmHg.  Cardiac output was mildly depressed
at 4.0 L/min.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year old male who was recently discharged [**10-11**] for
Vtach with pacer/ICD placement, NSTEMI with PMH of CHF with
EF=30-40%, afib on Coumadin HTN, Aortic Stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.07, mean
Grad 21 mmHg), CAD with 3VD s/p several PCIs with stenting, who
presented with acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation and
subsequently developed sub-ICD firing threshold slow monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia.
.
# Rhythm.  The patient developed sub-ICD threshold rate
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, the first episode of which
was asymptomatic and required overdrive pacing to terminate as
well as a trip to the CCU for closer monitoring and IV
amiodarone loading.  He will continue his loading regimen with
amiodarone 400mg PO BID until [**10-31**], amiodarone 400mg QD until
[**11-7**], and then amiodarone 200mg QD.  His VT focus is likely
from prior scar from past MIs.  Sotalol was discontinued after
this first VT episode.  He also had a second 3 minute run of
symptomatic ventricular tachycardia with chest pain and
shortness of breath a few days into his amiodarone loading.  EPS
with ablation of the VT focus was planned following this second
episode of VT on amiodarone, but the patient and his wife felt
that the risks of the procedure outweighed the benefits.  The
patient was discharged in his baseline rhythm of atrial
fibrillation and was continued on Coumadin at his home dose to
maintain an INR of [**2-27**].  He will be discharged on metoprolol
succinate 50mg daily for rate control of his afib.  This
metoprolol dose limits his tachycardia to only brief bursts to
the 130s on telemetry.  Further increases in beta blocker dose
was not tolerated by the patient's low blood pressure.
.
# Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation: The patient has
known chronic systolic heart failure with an EF=30-40% on an
ECHO [**10-5**].  He presented wi
