History of Present Illness:
66yo female with multiple medical problems including morbid
obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, COPD on 3 L O2, and likely
diastolic dysfunction was admitted from the ED with shortness of
breath.

She reports that she was in the hospital in [**2196-2-4**] for
shortness of breath thought related to a COPD and CHF
exacerbation. She was initially admitted to the MICU and then
transferred to the floor. She was treated with levofloxacin and
steroids with improvement in her symptoms. Her hospital course
was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and guiac
positive stool. She was discharged to rehab, where she was for 3
weeks. She then was doing relatively well and had tapered off
her steroids. Then over the last 24-48 hours, she has had
increasing shortness of breath. Her O2 sat is typically 96% on
3L and had declined to as low as 91% on 3L. Review of systems is
also notable for wheezing. She has chronic lower extremity
swelling, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and dyspnea
on exertion, which has been relatively unchanged. She otherwise
denies fevers, shaking chills, night sweats, cough, nausea,
vomiting, chest pain, sputum production, and lower extremity
edema.

Review of systems is also notable for the following:
- history of DVT in the past and coumadin was discontinued early
due to melena.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Upon arrival to the ED, vital signs were 99.5, HR 130s, BP
151/125, RR 21, 100% on NRB. Exam with wheezing. ECG was
unremarkable. She received aspirin 325mg PO x 1 and 40mg IV
lasix with 850mL UOP. Desat'd to 90s 4L. Upon arrival to the
floor, she reports significant improvement in her breathing.

Testing
[**2196-4-22**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (118bpm).
Baseline artifact. Diffuse ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2196-2-29**]  ST-T wave changes in the inferior
leads are similar. No diagnostic interim change.

[**2196-4-22**] CXR:
1. Findings consistent with volume overload.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis; underlying infection cannot be
excluded.

[**2196-4-26**] CXR:
In comparison with the study of [**4-24**], there may be mild
improvement
in pulmonary vascular status, though some of this may be related
to the
differences in technique. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
persists as does a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with
left basilar atelectasis.

[**2196-5-2**] Colonscopy:  Fair preparation
A single sessile 25 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in
the proximal ascending colon
Methylene blue 0.002% solution was injected submucosally beneath
the 25 mm in diameter proximal ascending colon polyp
successfully
Successful complete endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in a
piecemeal fashion of the 25 mm in diameter proximal ascending
colon was performed using a 15mm in diameter stiff snare
Successful argon plasma coagulation was performed on the entire
surface of the post-EMR site to prevent recurrence
A single sessile 6 mm polyp of benign appearance was found in
the proximal ascending colon. A single-piece complete
polypectomy was performed using a cold snare.
Small angioectasia without bleeding was identified in the
proximal ascending colon
Successful [**Hospital1 **]-Cap treatment was applied to the small
angioectasia identified in the proximal ascending colon
Multiple diverticula with medium openings were seen in the
descending colon and sigmoid colon. Diverticulosis appeared to
be of moderate severity.
Small grade 1 internal hemorrhoids were noted

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic HF: This, in addition to atrial
fibrillation and COPD (addressed below), likely contributed to
her dyspnea. Pateint was started on furosemide IV then
transitioned to a furosemide gtt and diuresed approximately 3L
daily. (LOS ~30L diuresed total). Then she was started on an
oral diuretic regimen of torsemide 80mg PO BID. This resulted in
marked improvement in her symptoms. Her oxygen requirement
slowly improved and she was weaned down to her home O2
requirement of 3L. Metoprolol was started and uptitrated to 75mg
