This 46 year old gentleman with PMH of HTN, lipids, and tobacco

He was treated with a Z-Pack with improvement until 2-3 weeks
later when he developed a dry cough and dyspnea with exertion,
such as climbing stairs or walking 30 feet. He previously had no
exercise limitations. He attributed these symptoms to a
persistent viral infection. Additionally, he experienced
progressive PND at night. Also has Finally, however, he was
becoming short of breath with only minimal exertion, and decided
to seek medical evaluation. He saw his PMD who referred him for
cardiac workup. Additionally at that time he was diagnosed with
new onset DM2.

An echocardiogram was done on [**2172-10-21**] and demonstrated a dilated
left ventricle with severe global systolic dysfunction with an
EF of approximately 10-15%. He had severe MR and mild TR and a
dilated left atrium. He was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for diagnostic
cath to evaluate the etiology of his heart failure.

[**10-23**] CARDIAC CATH
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease (LCX had an occluded [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] that filled via collaterals. The RCA was diffusely
diseased with proximal/mid vessel subtotal occlusion. The distal
RCA filled via collaterals from the left system).
2. Severely elevated right and left-sided filling pressures due
to known
severe  cardiomyopathy.
3. left ventriculography was deferred due to #2.
4. Unsuccessful PCI of the subtotally occluded RCA complicated
by a
Grade I dissection.
.
CHF WORKUP LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Acute systolic heart failure: His echo finding of global
systolic dysfunction with EF 10-15% in conjunction with only
mild CAD and sudden onset of HF sxs makes ischemic etiologies of
cardiomyopathy unlikely.  His work up for non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy was as follows: HIV neg, Fe studies wnl, TSH wnl.
 SPEP/UPEP pending.  His recent viral illness suggests a viral
etiology.  In addition, his history of ETOH use is also
concerning for ETOH induced CM.  He was diuresed with IV lasix,
with significant improvement of his symptoms.  He was discharged
with lasix 20 PO and with instructions for follow up in [**Hospital 1902**]
clinic.  He was also advised on ETOH cessation.
.
2. CAD: He has several cardiac risk factors including poorly
controlled HTN, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and DM.  C. cath
demonstrated 2 vessel dz.  His RCA PCI was complicated by
dissection.  He was treated with medical management with ASA,
BB, ACE-I, and statin.  See below for specific risk factor
modifications.
.
3. Hyperlipidemia: He was found to have an LDL 170.  He was
started on pravastatin as he reported "muscle aches" on lipitor.
 He tolerated the pravastatin during this hospitalization.
.
4. DM: He was found to have hyperglycemia.  He was started on
FSG qid and on glipizide 2.5.  His HgbA1c was pending on
discharge.  He was counselled on following a diabetic diet and
checking his FSG with meals.
.
5. Tobacco dependence: He was counselled on smoking cessation.
He was interested in attempting cessation at this time and
wished for assistance.  He was discharged with a prescription of
Chantix and with instructions to start his prescription 1 week
prior to his set quit date.  He will follow with his PCP for
progress on smoking cessation.
