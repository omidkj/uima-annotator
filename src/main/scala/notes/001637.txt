Pt is an 84 yo man with history of chronic CHF (EF 40%),

meds, afib on warfarin and congestive cirrhosis, who presents
with abdominal pain and hypotension. Pt is currently residing at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where he had complaints of abdominal pain. Pt says
that a day and a half ago he had some right sided sharp,
fleeting pain [**9-15**], non-radiating, lasting for a few seconds.

bowel movement yesterday. Says he has been passing gas. He says
he has been quite hungry, and hasn't really eaten anything for

noticed that his urination has decreased over the last day. He
says he last 10 lbs over the last week. He feels cold, but
denies fever or chills.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were trigger for hypotension
84/61 - per EMS, BPs labile on route. Exam was notable for pt
was able to answer questions, no somnolent, did not assess for
asterixis, irregular heart rate, significant bruising and
petechiae across the chest wall, no chest tenderess; no
back/flank bruising; guiaic positive, light brown stool. EKG was
vpaced 80. Cards was consulted for elevated trop, but not
concerned in setting of elevated Cr, and pt with no chest pain.
CXR showed a decrease in pulmonary vascular engorgement,
otherwise stable from prior. CT torso prelim read showed no
acute abnormalities to explain pain, and only small ascites.
Bedside u/s showed no pericardial effusion, and only minimal
ascites. Labs were notable for hyponatremia (125 from 135 most
recently), mildly decreased Hct from baseline 31-32 to 29.
Lactate 1.0. Cr was notable for elevation of 2.0 from 1.4, AST,
AP and lipase all mildly elevated. Tox screen not sent. He was
given 1L NS. Concern for infection, though WBC normal with
normal diff, and given one dose of Zosyn, and Vanc ordered, but
not yet given. UA and Urine cultures not yet sent. For access he
has 2, 18g.
.
Vital signs prior to transfer T96.8, 81, 94/51, 16, 100% 2L NC.

have any abdominal pain right now except for when he presses on
his right side.
.
He had a recent admission [**5-27**] for similar presentation of
abdominal pain, ileus, volume overload. He had acute on chronic
systolic heart failure, at which point his diuresis was
uptitrated. He was given a 3 day course of acetazolamide for
contraction alkalosis. He also had hyponatremia and [**Last Name (un) **]
attributed to heart failure and poor forward flow that improved
with diuresis. Then his Cr was 2.2, and decreased to 1.4 on the
day of discharge. Had upgrade to pacemaker at that time ([**Hospital1 **]-v
pacemaker placed [**5-28**]).
His abdominal pain then was attributed to ascites. He had a
diagnostic para that was negative for SBP.
.
He was seen 2 days ago in heart failure clinic, where he
appeared dry, weight 113 from 115 on discharge (was 135 on last
admission), and metolazone dose was decreased from 5mg daily to
2.5mg MWF.
.

Positive as above. Also notable for some SOB when he coughs, but
this is unchanged from prior. Also endorses knee pain from
chronic arthritis.

palpitations, nausea, vomiting, constipation, bloody or black
stools, hematuria, pain with urination though occasional
"burning" at the end of his penis.
