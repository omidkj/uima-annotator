History of Present Illness:
71F with ESRD on HD, IDDM, PVD, AF s/p PPM, cirrhosis, CAD, with
a recent mechanical fall during which she sustained fracture of
L forearm, referred to ED from cardiologist's office for
lethargy. She has been taking vicodin at home for pain from
fracture and had apparently been more "sleepy" lately. She went
to her cardiologist's office today for a routine visit and was
noted to be very lethargic, so sent to ED.

In ED, somnolent; ABG 7.29/63/88. Placed on BiPAP and mental
status improved, but within one hour of stopping BiPAP, became
lethargic again. Narcan given with minimal response. Restarted
BiPAP and sent to MICU for hypercarbic resp failure.

Past Medical History:

nephropathy, retinopathy, and Charcot foot bilaterally
- patient does not check her FS at home, she received 70 u in am

and 30 u in pm of 70/30. Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1313**] ? in [**Last Name (un) **].

conservative management

Social History:
Pt lives in her own home in [**Location (un) 1110**]. She has 24 hour help at this
time, although recently helper can't come in over the weekend,
the son has been speding more time with her. The patient rare
walks with a walker and mostly gets about in a wheelchair. She
is very close with her daughter, [**Name (NI) 2808**], who visits often and
her son, [**Name (NI) 96930**], who is her healthcare proxy. His phone number
is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 96931**]. DNR/DNI. Pt used tobacco in the past - quit 24
years ago. Denies ETOH or drug use.

Pertinent Results:
XRAY WRIST [**2121-5-15**]: Overlying cast material obscures detail.
There is an old, distracted fracture of the olecranon which is
similar in appearance compared to [**2120-3-26**].  There is a split
fracture of the radial stylus.  There is a lucent line within
the mid-body of the scaphoid, likely also consistent with a
fracture.  There is a minimally displaced fracture of the distal
portion of fifth metacarpal.  There is a small, nondisplaced
fracture of the ulnar
styloid.  There are degenerative changes at the first
carpometacarpal joint. There is widening of the scapholunate
interval.  There are diffuse vascular arterial calcifications.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Multiple fractures of the distal radius, distal ulna, fifth
metacarpal, and scaphoid as detailed above.
2.  Degenerative changes at the first CMC joint.
.
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2121-5-13**]:
1.  No evidence of intraabdominal hematoma or ascites.
2.  Left adrenal adenoma, as characterized by MRI in [**Month (only) 404**]
[**2114**].
3.  Extensive vascular calcifications including a calcified
splenic artery aneurysm.
4.  Incidentally noted are atrophied kidneys, hepatomegaly and
splenomegaly, cholelithiasis and diverticulosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course: Although the cause of her acute respiratory failure
remains unclear, a retrocardiac infiltrate on CXR could not be
ruled out, so antibiotics for CAP were started. Also consider
infected HD catheter; blood cultures are pending. Since mental
status cleared and respiratory status stable, called out.



A/P: 71 y/o F with MMP p/w somnolence and hypotension.
.
1) Somnolence: On arrival to MICU, mental status was alert and
oriented but sleepy; after one hour, HO called to see patient
for lethargy and minimal response to sternal rub. VBG confirmed
hypercarbia, BiPAP restarted and patient became more alert. Then
slept through night without event, alert and oriented to person,
place, and time ([**2121-5-9**]) in the morning. Consider hypercapnea
in the setting of OSA vs. narcotic use vs. pneumonia.  Mental
status continued to wax/wane in terms of her mental status
despite discontinuation of Vicodin. Sleep service was consulted
and patient dismissed them before they were able to complete an
evaluation.  She was recommended for outpatient follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4051**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] in Sleep Medicine.
.
2) ? Pneumonia: In consideration of hypercapnea and possible
retrocardiac opacity, patient was started on a 7-day course of
ceftriaxone, azithromycin.

3) Wrist fracture: Pt's L forearm imaged as she sustained fall
prior to admission to hospital (reportedly fell OOB).  Imaging
showed multiple fractures of the distal radius, distal ulna,
fifth metacarpal, and scaphoid. Degenerative changes at the
first CMC joint.  Plastic surgery consulted and they recommended
conservative management with thumb spica cast.  Patient was
advised to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] following discharge.
.
4) ESRD: On HD, renal following. Continued on sevelamer.  She
was treated with Vancomycin for suspicion of HD catheter
infection.
.
5) CAD: No active issues.  Troponin leak of 0.27, likely
secondary to ESRD.  Continue ASA, statin, lopressor.
.
6) Thrombocytopenia: Baseline platelets 50-100K, of uncertain
etiology. Documented negative HIT antibody x 2 in past.
.
7) Cirrhosis: Documented as secondary to cholestasis.  Continue
ursodiol.
.
8) FEN: Renal, diabetic diet.  Maintain K>4, Mg>2.
.
9) Prophylaxis: Continue PPI per home regimen.  Heparin SC as
DVT prophylaxis; will monitor platelets carefully.
.
10) Code status: DNR/DNI.
