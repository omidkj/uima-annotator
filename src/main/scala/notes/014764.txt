Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Furosemide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
left hip fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1) Intramedullary nailing left intertrochanteric hip fracture
with short gamma nail, 11 x 125 x 180.
2) Bronchoscopy
3) Blood transfusion
4) Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83 year old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG
and stent to OM in [**2121**] on ASA/Plavix, ischemic CHF EF 25-30%
with AICD, HTN, DM2, PVD, RA on prednisone, HTN, who presented
to [**Hospital3 24768**] on [**2123-4-30**] after suffering a mechanical fall
at home. He reports that he was in his usual state of health
until [**2123-4-30**] when he tripped while emerging from the bathroom at
home. He was taken to [**Hospital3 24768**] where he was reportedly
found to have a left intertrochanteric fracture of his left
femur. Since he has an extensive cardiac history (for which he
has received his care here), he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management on [**2123-5-2**].
.
The patient underwent left femur fracture repair on [**5-5**]. His
post-operative course was complicated by RUL collapse. RUL
reinflated s/p bronchoscopy in OR. However, on POD#1 RLL
collapse noted and Pulmonary was consulted. Bronchoscopy was
performed on [**5-7**] and was notable for large mucous plug which
was suctioned from his bronchus.
.
On [**2123-5-6**], the patient spiked fevers to 103 and was started on
vanco/zosyn for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia. Admission
WBC was 26.6.
.
On [**2123-5-7**], however, the patient began experiencing diarrhea and
was found to have C.diff negative stool with left-sided
abdominal pain. His WBC rose from 26 to near 79 with C. diff
toxin B positive. KUB yesterday without free air, however,
evidence of dilated bowel consistent with paralytic ileus.
However, toxic megacolon could not be excluded.
.
The patient is now on PO flagyl (day 2), IV vanco and zosyn (day
4) and the patient's symptoms improved marginally. He is still
having diarrhea.
.
Surgery was consulted on [**2123-5-9**] as well as oncology to assess
for acute leukemia given marked leukocytosis. Surgery felt the
KUB on [**2123-5-8**] was concerning for toxic megacolon and
recommended medical ICU for closer monitoring as well as CT
abdomen with oral contrast to assess further. NGT placed on
[**2123-5-9**].
.
In addition, the patient has developed acute on chronic renal
failure. Baseline Cr 1.2->2.5 now. The medical floor team
calculated his FeNa to be <1% and consistent with pre-renal
azotemia and the patient was given IVF. With fluid hydration,
the patient's O2 Sat's went from 96% to 88% on 4 liters and the
patient is now on 5 liters O2. CXR without evidence of CHF but
RLL and LLL atelectasis.
.
ID was consulted on [**2123-5-9**] for managment of C. diff colitis as
well as LLL pneumonia. Surgery recommended IV flagyl + PO
vancomycin. Renal was also consulted for worsening renal
function and felt the acute renal dysfunction was consistent
with ATN from sepsis. Urine lytes are pending. SBP 110s
(baseline 110s). Anti-hypertensives held on [**2123-5-9**] for concern
for sepsis. Lasix DC'd on [**2123-5-8**] with IVF hydration.
.
The patient was also noted to have trace guaiac positive stool
with mild hemoptysis post-bronch. Hct stable at 27 but
transfused 1 unit on [**2123-5-8**] with an appropriate bump to 30.
.
ROS:
Complains of shortness of breath, no chest pain, + chills, no
fevers. [**9-1**] abdominal pain on morphine PCA.

Pertinent Results:
XRAY LEFT HIP [**2123-5-2**]: There are moderate degenerative changes
of the left hip.  There is a left intertrochanteric femur
fracture. Although the fracture is nondisplaced in the AP view,
slight anterior apex angulation and distraction of the anterrior
fracture line is seen on the true lateral view. There is
probable diffuse osteopenia. No other fracture is detected
involving the left femur. Dense vascular calcification and
surgical clips are noted.  At the periphery of these films,
severe degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine and
moderate degenerative changes of the right hip are noted.
IMRESSION: Left femoral intertrochanteric fracture, with slight
distraction and anterior apex angulation, but overall anatomic
alignment.
.
CT ABDOMEN [**2123-5-9**]: 1.  Moderate circumferential bowel wall
thickening of the entire colon extending from rectum to cecum
with associated pericolonic inflammatory change and inflammation
of the associated mesentery.  Findings are in keeping with the
patient's stated history of Clostridium difficile.  Maximum
diameter of the transverse colon measures 7 cm.  There is no
definite evidence for toxic megacolon, however this entity is
not entirely excluded.
2.  Mild dilatation of the entire small bowel with no focal
transition point. Findings are suggestive of ileus.
3.  Moderate distention of the gallbladder.  If right upper
quadrant pain is present, right upper quadrant ultrasound could
be performed for further
characterization.
