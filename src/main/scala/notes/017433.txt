HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 52222**], twin #2, was
born at 25 and 1/7 weeks gestation.  [**Known lastname **] was born to a 29
year old, Gravida I, Para 0, now II woman.  This pregnancy
was conceived with in-[**Last Name (un) 5153**] fertilization and resulted in a
twin, diamniotic, dichorionic pregnancy.  The mother's
prenatal screens are blood type AB negative, antibody
negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive, hepatitis B
surface antigen negative, and group beta strep unknown.  This
pregnancy was uncomplicated until 22 and 2/7 weeks gestation
when the mother developed preterm labor and had cervical
changes.  [**Last Name (un) **] as treated with magnesium sulfate,
Betamethasone and Indomethacin.  She remained hospitalized on
bed rest.

On the day of delivery, she presented with full cervical
dilation.  Delivery was performed by cesarean section.
Infant emerged with some respiratory effort.  His apgars were
six at one minute and eight at five minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, birth weight was 1,820
grams; 50th percentile.  Length was 33 cm (50th percentile)
and head circumference was 23.5 cm (50th percentile).
Admission physical examination revealed an extremely
premature infant.  Anterior fontanel were soft and flat.
Eyelids were fused.  Palate was intact.  Diffuse bruising
noted over the lower half of the body.  Respiratory effort
was poor. Air entry in the bases but equal breath sounds with
retractions, improved after intubation and Surfactant
therapy.  No murmur.  Regular rate and rhythm.  Perfusion was
fairly good.  Abdomen was soft.  Three vessel cord. Testes in
canal bilaterally.  Tone and movement appropriate for
gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory:  He received two doses of
Surfactant and was started initially on high frequency
oscillating ventilation.  His chest x-ray initial showed some
pulmonary interstitial emphysema which has since resolved.
He remained on the high frequency oscillating ventilator
until day of life #30. At that time, he was extubated to
C-Pap. The highest ventilator settings he received were a
mean airway pressure of 13 with a delta-P as high as 30.
Caffeine citrate was started on day of life #30 in
preparation for extubation.  He remained on C-Pap until day
of life 59, when he was changed to nasal cannula.  He was on
nasal cannula until day of life 89 and he has been in room
air since day of life 89 with respiratory rates in the 40's
to 60's.  For a brief time, he required nasal cannula with
feedings. He has not required nasal cannula with feedings
since [**2185-10-28**].  Caffeine citrate was discontinued on
[**2185-9-26**] and he has not had any apnea or bradycardia
since coming off of caffeine.

Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname **] required Dopamine on the first few
days of life, with a maximum dose of 14.5 mcg/kg per minute.
Dopamine was discontinued on day of life two.  [**Known lastname **]
received two courses of Indomethacin, the first one for
presumed patent ductus arteriosus on day of life #3 when a
murmur was present.  The murmur resolved after treatment.  On
[**2185-7-29**], he had increasing ventilatory requirements
and had an echocardiogram which showed a small patent ductus
arteriosus.  At that time, he received a second course of
Indomethacin.  A clinical decompensation on [**2185-8-6**] prompted a repeat echocardiogram which showed a moderate
sized patent ductus arteriosus, scheduling a ligation. He was
transferred to [**Hospital3 1810**] and received a patent
ductus arteriosus ligation on [**2185-8-8**] and was
transferred back to [**Hospital1 69**]
after surgery.  He has remained normotensive with heart rates
130 to 160's, no murmur. His main blood pressures have been
41 to 51.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname **] was initially
receiving nothing by mouth.  Total fluids 120 cc per kg per
day of D-5-W.  An umbilical arterial catheter and an
umbilical venous catheter were placed shortly after delivery.
He was advanced to total fluids of 150 cc per kg per day by
day of life three.  He remained n.p.o. until day of life 15
and, during that time, he received total parenteral
nutrition.  Glucoses remained stable during that time.  His
initial electrolytes on admission showed a sodium of 142,
chloride of 107, potassium of 4.2, C02 of 26, ionized calcium
of 1.29. Enteral feedings were started on day of life 15 and
he advanced to 30 cc per kg and, at that time, was noted to
have a patent ductus arteriosus and was made n.p.o. again.
Enteral feeds were again started on day of life 26 to 10 cc
per kg per day, of breast milk 20 calories per ounce.  He
advanced to full volume feedings of 130 cc per kg per day of
breast milk, 20 calories per ounce, by day of life #32.
Maximum caloric density was 30 calories with ProMod and this
was achieved by day of life 37.  [**Known lastname **] tolerated feedings
without difficulty.  With improving weight gain, calories
were decreased and he is currently receiving Enfamil 24
calories per ounce p.o., a minimum of 130 cc per kg per day.
He has been taking in approximately 150 to 170 cc per kg per
day p.o.  The most recent electrolytes on day of life 64
showed a BUN of 14, creatinine of 0.2, alkaline phosphatase
of 350, calcium of 10.1, phosphorus of 5.7.  His current
weight is 3,690 grams.  Head circumference is 35 cm.  Length
51 cm.

Gastrointestinal:  [**Known lastname **] was treated with phototherapy for
hyperbilirubinemia from day of life one until day of life 17.
Maximum bilirubin level was 4.0 with direct of 0.5.  A
rebound bilirubin level on day of life 18 showed a total of
1.7 and direct of 0.6.  He has had some intermittently guaiac
positive stools but his KUB have shown well distributed
polygonal bowel loop, no pneumatosis and no dilation.

Hematology:  Blood type is AB positive, Coombs negative.  He
received a total of three packed red blood cell transfusions
this hospitalization.  His initial hematocrit on admission
was 48.2%.  His most recent hematocrit on day of life 78
showed a hematocrit of 27.8%.  Reticulocyte count on day of
life 56 was 7%.

Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname **] was started on Ampicillin and
Gentamycin at the time of admission for sepsis suspicion.
Antibiotics were discontinued after 48 hours when the blood
cultures were negative and he was clinically well.  On day of
life 10, he presented with a clinical decompensation and was
started on Ampicillin and Gentamycin.  That was changed to
Vancomycin and Gentamycin.  Based on his chest x-ray, it was
felt to be pneumonia.  He completed 10 days of antibiotics on
[**2185-8-7**].  He has not had any other issues with
sepsis since that time.

Neurology:  His first head ultrasound on [**7-19**] was within
normal limits.  His second head ultrasound on [**7-22**]
showed a left intraventricular hemorrhage.  The last head
ultrasound on [**9-1**] showed a resolving left germinal
matrix with intraventricular extension.  A repeat head
ultrasound is being performed prior to discharge, on [**2185-11-2**].

Ophthalmology:  Eyes were examined most recently on [**10-31**], revealing mature retinal vessels. A follow-up
