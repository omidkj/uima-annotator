BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2150-10-12**], the patient was
admitted to the cardiac surgery service. He was preop'd for
mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft.
His preop laboratory values were the following: His
hematocrit was 39.5, his white blood cell count was 7.6, his
platelets were 163. His serum sodium was 141, his potassium
was 4.4, his chloride was 104, his bicarb was 28, and his BUN
was 20. His creatinine was 1.1 and glucose was 98. His coags
showed PT of 15, PTT was 30, and his INR was 1.6. The patient
had a carotid ultrasound. He was started on Heparin and
repeat coags were checked in the morning prior to surgery.

The patient was in hospital for approximately 3 days prior to
surgery for preoperative evaluation in order to monitor him
and prep him for surgical procedure which he had on [**2150-10-16**]. On [**10-16**], the patient underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x2 and a mitral valve replacement.

On postoperative day 1, the patient was in the cardiothoracic
surgery intensive care unit. He was doing well and promptly
transferred to the regular hospital floor. His blood pressure
was monitored strictly as were his ins and outs. He had chest
tubes that were removed on postoperative day 2. He was
transfused a unit of blood on postoperative day 2. His gout
was also controlled and colchicine was restarted as per his
prior preoperative medications. The patient was maintained on
a heparin drip due to previous atrial fibrillation. He was
also started on Coumadin following his surgery. Lopressor was
also used to control his blood pressure. The patient had an x-
ray of the left hand to rule out a subluxation at the left
first digit at the MP joint. The x-ray was negative for any
fractures. He had a physical examination by the house officer
which revealed a chronic gamekeeper's thumb. The patient was
advised that if he wanted to pursue surgery that he could do
so and can follow up with the hand surgeon. The patient
denied that.  The patient was continued on Heparin drip and
Coumadin, however waiting for the patient's Coumadin to
become therapeutic.

On postoperative day 6, the patient was continued on heparin
and Coumadin. On postoperative day 8, the patient's Coumadin
was finally therapeutic at 2.2. He was discharged with very
strict instructions that he was to follow up at [**Hospital6 3426**]. The patient's previous primary care physician no
longer worked at [**Hospital6 33**]. Arrangements were made
with a nurse at [**Hospital6 33**] so that the patient
could be followed up within 3 days for adjustment of his INR
dosing.

He was discharged on 5 of Coumadin for 3 days and he also had
2.5 mg tablets of his Coumadin.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg PO b.i.d. for 7 days.
2.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq PO q12 hours for 7 days.
3.  Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 81 mg, delayed release PO once daily, 30 tabs, 2
    refills.
5.  Percocet 5/325 mg 1 to 2 tabs PO q4 to 6 hours, dispensed
    30 tabs.
6.  Bisacodyl 10 mg suppository daily, dispensed 30.
7.  Atorvastatin 10 mg PO once daily, 30 tabs, 2 refills.
8.  Colchicine 0.6 mg 1 tab PO once daily.
9.  Metoprolol 25 mg PO b.i.d.
10. Protonix 40 mg PO once daily.
11. Coumadin 2.5 mg tablets.

The patient was to take 5 mg for the next 3 days and then
follow up with his primary care physician  at [**Hospital6 3426**] at the [**Hospital 263**] clinic for adjustment.
