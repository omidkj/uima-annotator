History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old male with a history COPD who has been
intubated in the past recent admitted for hypoxia/COPD
exacerbation in [**Month (only) 958**]. At that time he improved on BiPAP and did
not require intubation. He was treated with steroids,
azithromycin and BiPAP. He also has a history of dCHF and was
diuresed on last admit. On this admit he reports shortness of
breath for the past few days. He reports using his BiPAP
regularly at night. His difficulty breathing started when the
tempurature became worse. For the past week, in the heat, his
breathing has been particularly bad. He has not had any sick
contact or any signs of infection. He denies orthopnea or weight
gain or leg edema. He only endorses shortness of breath.
.
Of note, per the daughter patient likely took his meds twice
this week on one night accidentally. He is often forgetful and
has difficulty with his medications per his family.
.
When EMS found patient they reported that his apt was very hot
and there was no A/C.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 103 (rectal temp). 28 130/87 34 91%.
He initially was breathing close to 40 and speaking in 2 word
sentances. A chest X-ray was done that showed hyperinflated
lungs without clear evidence of pneumonia. Patient was given
albuterol and ipratroprium nebs, methylprednisolone 125mg IV,
potassium 60mg total, azithromycin and tylenol. He received a
total of 2.5L of IVF. He improved slightly after neb treatment
and was able to speak in full sentances. He was persistently
tachycardic in the ED. His temperature decraesed to 99.4 orally
in teh ED. Given the fact that he was still breathing in the low
30s so the decision was made to admit him to the ICU.
.
On the floor, he is in mild respiratory distress. He has no
complaints other than shortness of breath.
.
Review of sytems:

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief MICU Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU given persistent tachypnea in
the ED.  He was treated for COPD exacerbation with frequent
nebs, IV steroids and continuation of home advair.  His
Theophyline was initially held, but restarted after a level
returned therapeutic.  His O2 sats were in the high 80s to low
90s which is his baseline.  His heart rate was fast 110-120s.
It was an atrial tachycardia that was thought to be related to
respiratory distress and medications (albuterol and
theophyline).  His heart rate did not change with giving him
fluids.  He was treated for a pneumonia as he presented with a
fever.  He defervesced after admition and it was suspected that
his fever was from his environment.  However given poor lung
status, decision was made to treat with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin for a 7 day course.  He remained stable and was
continued on his home BiPAP at night.  He was called out to the
medical floor for further managment.

On medical floor Pt was stable and slowly returned to baseline.

# COPD - pt was on 4L home O2 at baseline.  over the course of
his stay his lung function improved and he was discharged to
home with oxygen.  Pt has poor lung function at baseline, but he
was showing O2 sats in the 89-93 range.  Encouraged BiPAP at
night.

# atrial tachycardia - pt came to the floor with a resting
tachycardia of 110's.  When he would move to eat or shuffle in
bed his HR would jump to the 150's-160's.  This is likely
related to his hypoxia secondary to his lung disease.  Pt was
monitored, but he was never symptomatic from these acute rises
in HR.

#INR - PT INR was drastically elevated on admission.  Warfarin
was discontinued and pt INR decreased.  As it trended down to
normal range pt was monitored, but ther were no signs of acute
bleeding.  Pt INR returned to [**Location 213**] and he was started on
heparin drip with a bridge to warfarin.  Pt INR increased to
therapuetic dose and was sent home with follow up
