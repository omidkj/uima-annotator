Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valve replacement with 19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical valve,
mitral valve ring with a 26mm ring, tricuspid valve ring with a
26mm ring, coronary artery bypass grafting times one (saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery) [**2118-9-20**]


History of Present Illness:
60 year old female with complex past medical history who has
developed progressive and worsening dyspnea and fatigue. Workup
revealed single vessel coronary artery disease, moderate to
severe mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation
and mild to moderate aortic insufficiency. A nuclear stress test
was performed which did not reveal any perfusion defects or
myocardial ischemia. Originally it was planned to manage her
medically however she has been severely limited by dyspnea with
minimal to no exertion and fatigue which classifies her as a
grade [**2-4**] heart failure. Additionally, cardiac cath reveals
single vessel Coronary Artery Disease.  Given the severity of
her symptoms and extent of her disease, she has been referred to
Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgical management.

Past Medical History:
- Coronary artery disease
- Mitral,aortic and tricuspid regurgitation
- Likely rheumatic heart disease
- Peripheral vascular disease
- Atrial fibrillation on dabigatran/Coumadin. Both stopped

- IgA nephropathy s/p DCD kidney transplant in [**2111**], with
subsequent CKD
- Osteoporosis
- Breast CA ~ [**2106**]. No radiation.
- Hearing Impaired
- Varicose veins with history of venous ulcer
- Asthma
- Kidney Transplant [**2111**]

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. Dilated coronary sinus (diameter >15mm).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets. Minimal AS. Moderate
to severe (3+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed mitral valve leaflets.
Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral valve leaflets
with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet motion. Severe
(4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Moderate to
severe [3+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS:
Normal LV systolic function with LVEF >55%, with no segmental
wall motion abnormalities. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The coronary sinus is dilated (diameter >15mm) and left
arm contrast is seen entering coronary sinus prior to entering
RA confirming persistent left svc. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis but this is in the
setting of decreased LV antegrade stroke volume with severe MR .
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. AI jet
height/LVOT diameter > 65%, AI vena contracta > 0.6 cm. The
mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The
mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen due type 3a [**Last Name (un) 3843**] leaflet
motion (restricton in both systole and diastole). Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Initially the TR
was moderate but this changed to severe during the exam
(holosystolic hepatic venous flow reversal was initially not
present, but this developed during the exam and the vena
contracta increased to > 0.7 cm). There is no pericardial
effusion.
POSTBYPASS:
Post Aortic Valve replacement, Mitral Valve repair, Tricuspid
Valve repair single vessel CABG on Epi and Milrinone. AV
mechanical st-[**Male First Name (un) **] valve with good function. TV repair with good
result, trace to mild TR with no Tricuspic stenosis. MV with
moderate to severe MR following mitral valve annuloplasty ring.
No aortic dissection seen after cannula removed. Normal LV
systolic function. Normal RV funciton initially post pump, but
there was mild RV dysfunction at the end of the exam. Results
discussed with the surgical team.
