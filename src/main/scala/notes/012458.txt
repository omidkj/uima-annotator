CT ABDOMEN: Again noted are moderate bilateral pleural effusions
and bibasilar atelectasis. Within the limits of this noncontrast
study, the liver is normal. Cholelithiasis is again identified.
The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and atrophic kidneys are
stable in appearance. Stomach and bowel loops are unremarkable.
There is no free air or free fluid. No mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified.
.
CT PELVIS: The bladder, sigmoid colon, rectum, right pelvic
transplant kidney are again seen. A femoral-femoral bypass graft
is again identified. There is no evidence of groin or
retroperitoneal hematoma. There is no free fluid and no pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION: The angiogram showed a mid 70% lesion
in the LAD. We planned to direct stent this. Heparin and reopro
were used
prophylactically. Reopro was preferred due to her renal failure.
A 6F [**Doctor Last Name **]
0.75 guide provided adequate support. We then derectly deployed
a 2.5 X
18mm Cypher stent at 14 at. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow
with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no embolisation.
The
patient left the lab in a stable condtion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 47 y/o female with IDDM c/b ESRD (s/p living donor renal
transplant [**2164**]), PVD (s/p recent right 5th toe debridement [**1-14**]
osteomyelitis), HTN, and CVA x2 who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
chills and sweats x2d. She was admitted to general medicine and
treated broadly for CAP (CXR w/ lingular and RLL opacities) w/
zosyn/vanco given her immunosuppressed state.  In the context of
this treatment course, the patient was noted to have
persistently elevated blood glucose values and was started on an
insulin gtt.  Also, CE drawn at her admission demonstrated a
troponin of 0.26 w/ TWI anteriorly and inferiorly.  She was
taken urgently to the cath lab where she received a DES to the
LAD and was sent to the CCU for further monitoring.  Following
her transfer out of the CCU, the following issues were
addressed:
.
# Hypoxia: Patient received R thoracentesis  for a transudative
effusion that was likely [**1-14**] her significantly fluid overloaded
state.  900cc was removed.  After the thoracentesis the patient
was quickly weaned from 6L O2 by NC back down to room air.  An
HD catheter was placed and the patient received a total of 3
runs of HD for ultrafiltration, with continued symptomatic
improvement.  There was no reaccumulation of per pleural
effusion on discharge.
.
# CAP: Patient presented with a LLL opacity on admission, which
was initiallytreated with Levaquin.  With her respiratory
decompensation preceding her thoracentesis, she was switched to
Zosyn for coverage amid concern for possible infectious cause.
She completed a course of Zosyn for this opacity, and was
discharged without any additional antibiotics.  She was
restarted on her Bactrim for prophylaxis on discharge, given her
immunosuppression.
.
# Blood Pressure Control:  Following her CCU admission with
coronary angioplasty, the patient was transferred back to the
medical [**Hospital1 **].  She received all of her antihypertensive
medications as well as some pain medication all in close
proximity to eachother, and then suffered a hypotensive episode
with SBP in the 70s.  The patient was transferred to the MICU
briefly for this hypotension.  She was very fluid responsive,
had a normal lactate, normal WBC count, and no fever.  Concern
for an RP bleed was briefly entertained given the recent cath,
but CT
