HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 37590**] is an 84-year-old
male with a past medical history of myocardial infarction,
severe COPD, CVAs times two, amyloid angiopathy.  He is a
nursing home resident with dementia.  He was transferred from
[**Hospital3 3834**] to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2742**] of
abdominal aortic aneurysm felt to be expanding and possibly
leaking at the time of his transfer.

The patient initially presented to the [**Hospital3 3834**] with
hypercarbic respiratory acidosis secondary to COPD.  He was
intubated.  Status post intubation, he had a decreased blood
pressure to 55/31.  He was placed on empiric coverage of
antibiotics.  The white count was 12.6, hematocrit 40.9,
temperature maximum of 100.  A chest x-ray at the time was
read as having left lower lobe pneumonia.  At the time, he
was found to have a non ST elevation MI, troponin maximum of
0.92, hypertensive 60/30.  A Swan-Ganz showed a wedge of
[**9-23**].  He was placed on pressors temporarily.  The cardiac
index at the time was found to be 3.1, 2.6.  He received
vancomycin, Cipro, and ceftriaxone.

His MI was treated with a beta blocker but not with aspirin.
It had been held secondary to a hematocrit drop of 40 to 32.
He had an EGD at the time showing [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear and
erosive gastritis.  Also at [**Hospital3 3834**], he was found
to have a AAA on examination.  Also, an ultrasound was done
which was concerning for pelvic fluid leak, possibly
secondary to this AAA.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2105-2-17**] for [**Date Range 2742**] of this AAA, possible CT and repair.

The patient was placed on the Surgery Service, being located
in the SICU.  The patient was transferred to the MICU for
ventilatory weaning.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  COPD, chronic, FEV1 approximately 1 liter.
2.  CAD, status post MI.
3.  PVD.
4.  Carotid disease, 50% left carotid artery.
5.  Two CVAs while anticoagulated secondary to amyloid
angiopathy.
6.  AAA, previously noted to be 4.5 cm, found her at the [**Hospital1 **] to be 6.3 cm on a CT angio.
7.  Depression.
8.  Dementia.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies, but
anticoagulation is being held, including aspirin, secondary
to his amyloid angiopathy.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident of [**Hospital6 37591**] Home.  His wife and his daughter are both involved in
his care.  He has a significant tobacco history of
approximately 100 pack years.  He does not drink.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

DIET:  At presentation, it was reported that the patient was
on nectar-thickened liquids.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the MICU at [**Hospital1 **], the
patient was found to have a cardiac index of approximately 2.
Blood cultures, urine cultures, and x-rays were performed.
There was no evidence of any infectious processes.  He
finished a course of vancomycin and Levaquin.  He was
extubated on the evening of [**2105-2-17**].  The ABGs were 7.43,
37, 95.  His hematocrit was stable.  His Swan-Ganz catheter
was discontinued and he was anywhere from 86 to 96 on room
air, mostly in the mid 90 percents in room air.  He was noted
to have no gag reflex.  A NG tube was placed for tube feeds.

On examination on transfer from the MICU to the floor, heart
rate 88, respiratory rate 20, 94% on room air, blood pressure
132-170/60-80.  He was comfortable, sitting up in bed, in no
acute distress.  He had oral secretions that were audible in
his oropharynx.  HEENT:  Anicteric.  Neck:  Supple.  There
was no JVD.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2.  He
had a medial and inferior PMI.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
He is barrel-chested.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation.  No
wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.  Abdomen:  He had normoactive
bowel sounds.  The AAA pulsation was very clearly felt at the
abdominal wall.  His abdomen was soft.  There was no
tenderness, no distention.  Extremities:  He has trace lower
extremity edema without any movement, +[**1-11**] dorsalis pedis
pulses.  Neurological:  He was A&O times one.  He moves all
four extremities.  Cranial nerves II through XII with the
exception of cranial nerve IX were intact.  He had no overt
lesions on the skin.  He is Guaiac positive.

The patient had a CT angio of the abdomen on [**2105-2-17**].
The CT of the abdomen with contrast read bilateral pleural
effusions.  Eight centimeters from the liver there is a 7 mm
low attenuated lesion, multiple low attenuated lesions of
both kidneys, likely representing a cyst, largest measuring
1.5 by 1.3 cm.  Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm
measuring 6.3 cm in maximum diameter with patent lumen
measuring 3.4 by 3.6 cm, extends infrarenally, approximately
8 cm, ends above the bifurcation, multiple calcifications in
the wall as well as some false lumen.  In the right pelvis,
there is a 4.3 by 7 cm collection consistent with free fluid.
No air was identified.  No active leak or extravasation of
fluid was present.

The patient had a video swallowing study on [**2105-2-20**].
He had been given nectar-thickened liquids with liquid
barium, moderate delay in oral transient time, substantial
pool of secretions in the vallecula, direct aspiration as
well as aspiration of the pooled secretions were noted.
Spontaneous cough was weak and ineffective.

The patient's EKG showed low voltage, LAD, left atrial
abnormality, QT prolongation, normal sinus at 65 beats per
minute, biphasic P waves in II, III, and aVF.

He had an echocardiogram done on [**2105-2-18**].  Septal wall
thickness 1.2 cm, inferolateral septal thickness 1.3 cm, EF
65%, TR gradient 37 mmHg.  Left ventricle symmetrical.  Left
ventricular hypertrophy, mild.  LV cavity size was normal.
Suboptimal quality, focal wall inertia could not be ruled
out.  Overall, left ventricular systolic function was greater
than 55%.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion were normal, aortic root mildly dilated.  Aortic valve
leaflets were mildly thickened.  The mitral valve leaflets
were mildly thickened, +1 mitral regurgitation, +2 TR,
moderate pulmonary systolic artery hypertension, no
pericardial effusion.

On the date of discharge, the patient's white count was 12,
hematocrit 41.9, hemoglobin 14.1, platelet count 137,000.
INR 1.1.  Glucose 93, BUN 20, creatinine 0.9.  Sodium 139,
potassium 4.3, chloride 105, bicarbonate 25, calcium 8.5,
phosphate 2.8, magnesium 2.0.

The patient had an abdominal aortic angiogram on [**2105-2-19**], in which he received a contrast load on that date.  It
should be noted, that at the current time of this dictation,
the official report is unavailable.

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a past medical
history of COPD, AAA, CAD, dementia, amyloid angiopathy, who
presents from the MICU to the floor extubated, with a stable
hematocrit, status post non ST elevation MI and upper GI
bleed at the outside hospital and in general doing well.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  A.  CAD:  The patient had a small
elevation in troponin thought secondary to a small non ST
elevation MI.  The CKs were flat, according to the outside
hospital.  He was placed on an ACE inhibitor 30 q.d.  He was
placed on a low-dose of beta blocker 12.5 b.i.d. and
tolerated it despite his recent COPD exacerbation.  His
aspirin was held given the GI bleed and the amyloid
angiopathy.

His blood pressure on the date of discharge was in the
130s-150s and heart rate in the 70s, 98% on the date of
discharge on room air.

2.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient had an
echocardiogram as described above.  His EF was well
maintained despite the recent small myocardial infarction.

3.  PULMONARY/HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS:  The patient
had the COPD exacerbation.  With the intubation, he was
initially pl
