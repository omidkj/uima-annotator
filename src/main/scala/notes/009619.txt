History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 year-old F with Crohn's disease (intact anatomy,
maintained on Asacol and Ciprofloxacin), alcoholic cirrhosis,
PUD, pancreatic insufficiency, CAD on aspirin 325mg and plavix,
and CHF who presents with BRBPR since Tuesday AM. She awoke on
Tuesday morning with a large, non-painful, bloody bowel movement
(stool mixed with blood as well as blood pouring from her
rectum, no clots). She stayed at home because she thought it
would resolve spontaneously, but over the course of Tuesday
([**2-20**]) she had 9 more bowel movements. She presented to the ED
yesterday (Wed, [**2-21**]) where her Hct was 27.0 down from 34.8 2
days prior, and proceded to have around [**8-19**] more bloody bowel
movements. She received 1U pRBCs with no increase in her Hct, so
received 1 additional unit with last Hct of 30.8. She has had 4
large bloody BMs already today. Both the patient and nurse say
there was hardly any stool, but mostly blood and blood clots.
The medical team has held her plavix (still on full-dose ASAS)
and initially stopped her BB, but she has been tachycardic to
140's and light-headed with movement so they resumed the BB just
this afternoon. She also reported dizziness and nausea with
this. She denies any hematemesis, chest pain, and altered mental
status. She only has 1 PIV due to body habitus.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname 108723**] was diagnosed with Crohn's disease at age 39 when
she presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and bloody
diarrhea. She has been maintained since this time on Asacol (and
recently Ciprofloxacin + Asacol) with very few flares and no
surgery. She has baseline [**8-18**] BM's per day (thought to be due to
pancreatic insufficiency) with no systemic symptoms (including
fevers, arthralgias, rash, abdominal pain) and had a normal
colonscopy in 8/[**2102**]. She did have an episode of GI bleeding
[**2102-2-5**] similar to this, but lasting only 24 hours. She was not
scoped because the bleeding coincided with initiation of
aspirin/plavix; bleeding resolved spontaneously.
.
ROS: Pt denies fever or chills. No recent weight loss or gain.
Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. No orthopnea. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, or constipation. No dysuria. No sick contacts, no
undercooked meat or pets (other than a house cat).

son who is currently incarcerated. She was married but divorced
a long time ago. 4 pack year smoking history, quit 6 years ago.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.3 BP: 100/60-120/86 P: 90-108 at rest RR: 20 SpO2:
98% RA wt 192 lbs
General: cheerful, well-appearing, bed in NAD.
HEENT: EOMI, sclera anicteric. MMM, OP without lesions
Neck: supple, unable to assess JVD.
Pulm: crackles to b/t bases
Cardiac: RRR, nl S1/S2, no murmurs appreciated
Abdomen: soft, diffusely tender, mild distention. + BS. no
rebound or guarding.
Rectal: BRBPR, glove with maroon blood coating glove
Ext: No edema b/t


Pertinent Results:
Colonoscopy: Internal hemorrhoids, Diverticulum in the sigmoid
colon
Additional notes: Bleeding likely hemorrhoidal in origin. No
blood seen in colon. Normal mucosa
.
CT ABD [**2-21**] - Distended gallbladder. If clinically indicated,
this could be further evaluated by ultrasound. Nonspecific small
amount of free fluid within the pelvis
.
ECHO [**12-16**] - The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%) Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal RV size and function. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressures could not be determined as a tricuspid
regurgitant jet was not well seen. If clinically indicated,
focused views after the injection of agitated saline could help
to estimate PA pressures.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2100-11-11**],
the findings are similar.
.
PERTINENT LABS:
Hct remained stable and greater than 27.
creatinine remained at baseline.


Brief Hospital Course:
64yoF with stable Crohn's disease, PUD, CAD, and pancreatic
insuffiency presented with BRBPR,
.
# BRBPR - Patient has known Crohn's disease and intermittent RLQ
pain at baseline. She had >5 episodes of bloody diarrhea upon
admission to hospital and HCT did not increase appropriately to
3 units of PRBCs. Nasogastric lavage was negative. At that
point, the medical team was unable to get adequate venous access
and she was transferred to ICU for access and closer monitoring.
In the MICU, she had a R IJ CVL placed and remained
hemodynamically stable with no frther bloody stools or
transfusion needs. She underwent colonocopsy which revealed
internal hemorrhoids and diverticuli, but otherwise normal
appear colonic mucosa and no obvious source of bleed. She was
transferred back to the medical floor and continued to do well.
Her aspirin, plavix (BMS in [**1-15**]), Toprol, Diovan, lasix were
stopped initially in the setting of bleed and for colonoscopy.
She was restarted on her aspirin and 2 days later developed one
more episode of BRBPR. Aspirin was [**Last Name (un) 7162**] held. GI was
reconsulted. She then underwent capsule endoscopy study to
evaluate for upper GI source of bleed. She tolerated this well
and had no further bloody bowel movements. Her Hct remained
stable in the 24-25 range; however, given her CAD hisotry, she
was transfused one more unit at discharge. By discharge, she was
feeling well.
-- She was told to stop her aspirin, plavix until she sees Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2161**] in follow-up on [**2-/2024**]
-- She was told to stop her diovan and take a decreased dose of
Toprol (25 mg instead of 100mg) until she sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
[**Company 191**] on Friday [**3-2**]. If at that time, BP is higher, she can
restart these BP meds. The lasix she only takes when she is
above her dry weight.
.
# Crohn's disease - Stable disease state as per primary Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  She continued home regimen of asacol, cipro, and
creon.
.
# CAD - She had no chest pain or coronary complaints.  Her
cardiac medications were adjusted as above.
.
# CHF - ECHOs from past showed compromised EF, but has resolved
EF in [**12-16**]. She was at her goal weight of 192 lbs. She only
takes lasix if weight greater than 195 pounds, and she did not
