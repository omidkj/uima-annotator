Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
77M with history of CAD, AF, esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT,
resection and chemotherapy who initially presented with
tachypnea [**12-30**] pericardial and pleural effusions and transferred
to MICU after thoracentesis, pericardiocentesis and pericardial
window with chest tube for pneumothorax. Stable respiratory
status since transfer to floor.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis
Right Anterior Mini Thoracotomy and Pericardial Window
Bronchoscopy
Right heart catheterization
PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
Admitted to [**Location (un) **] from [**Hospital **] Rehab with tachypnea and
hypoxia.
Per OSH records, patient had been experiencing shortness of
breath, with O2 sats in the high 60's, RR in 40's.  O2 sats
improved with Lasix up to 90% on 2L, BP 98-109/40-60s, HR
70-80s.  Pt was given cefepime and levaquin for R-sided
infiltrate seen on CXR and underwent a US guided thoracentesis
for R-sided effusion.  1 liter of serous fluid removed,
post-procedure CXR showed 10% R apical pneumothorax.  In
addition, patient went into a-fib w/ hr into 160's.  Patient
given dig, amiodarone (loaded and drip x 6 hours) and diltiazem
drip.  Patient underwent echo which showed large pericardial
effusion, sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation/pericardiocentesis.
.
Of note, patient recently discharged from [**Hospital3 **] after 2
week hospitalization for bilateral pleural effusions and
pneumonia.
.
On admission, patient states that he been feeling progressively
SOB for the past week, and has noticed increased swelling of his
lower extremities, making it difficult to walk.  Denies any
current chest pain, reports currently breathing comfortably.  No
F/C/N/V.  H/o productive cough. + orthopnea.


Past Medical History:
HTN, lung disease, pleural tap 1L on right [**9-29**], COPD
exacerbation, esophageal cancer- Barrett's, stage II, T1, N1, MO
adenocarcinoma, s/p resection, chemo and radiation (completed
approx. 2 months ago), J-tube in place for supplemental
nutrition, PAF on coumadin (saw Mirbach for tachy thought to be
a-fib/flutter after adenosine x1), h/o cardioversion, anemia,
h/o kidney stones, "trigger finger", cataract surgery


Social History:
married w/ two sons, lives w/ wife [**Name (NI) 382**]. Former manager of
phone company. + 60 pack year tob history, quit 6 months ago.
+h/o ETOH, quit 6 months ago.


Family History:
Mom deceased at 78 from MI, Dad deceased from MS at 44. Brother
w/ quad bypass 78.


Physical Exam:
97.0/ 72/ 28/ 111/72 85kg/ 93% on 5L NC
GEN:pale, awake, alert, sitting up in bed, breathing comfortably
HEENT:atraumatic, anicteric sclerae, clear OP
NECK:no carotid bruits, JVP about 10cm
CV:muffled and distant HS, no murmurs appreciated, +pleural rub,
+femoral pulses, faint but +DP and PT pulses. Pulsus of 9.
LUNGS:diminished on R, crackles at bases, deeply productive
cough
ABDOMEN: soft, j-tube in place, site CDI, NABS, nt
EXT:[**1-29**]+ pitting edema bilaterally on LE, UE edema bilaterally,
+ clubbing of nails, resting tremor of R leg
NEURO:A/O X3, spontaneous movement x4. no focal deficits


Pertinent Results:
EKG: a-fib, low voltage in precordial and limb leads, no ST
changes or TWI
.
Cath ([**9-30**]): Right heart catheterization demonstrated elevated
right atrial and right ventricular end diastolic pressures which
were approximately equal to pericardial pressures (12 mmHg0
suggestive of early tamponade. After pericardiocentesis,
pericardial pressures returned to 0 mmHg. Cardiac output
calculated using the Fick method demonstrated moderate to
severely diminished cardiac index of 2.0L/min/m2 prior to
pericardiocentesis, with improvement to 2.6L/min/m2 after
pericardiocentesis. PA sat improved 48 to 58.
.
Echo ([**10-11**]): approximately 1 cm wide partially echo dense
region around the heart (most prominent anteriorly) consistent
with probable somewhat organized pericardial effusion and
pericardial thickening. No definite echocardiographic signs of
tamponade are identified but views are technically suboptimal.
Echo ([**10-6**]): moderate sized pericardial effusion. No right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There is sustained right
atrial collapse, consistent with low filling pressures or early
tamponade
Echo ([**10-2**]): moderate pericardial effusion, anterior to RA and
RV, consistent with loculation
Echo ([**9-30**]): anterior space fat pad, but possible loculated
anterior pericardial effusion
Echo ([**9-29**]): large pericardial effusion with increased
intrapericardial pressure, EF 50-60%
.
CXR ([**10-11**], 14:26): Probable small right apical pneumothorax.
Status post placement of small bore chest tube. Moderate right
and small left pleural effusions.
CXR ([**10-11**], 10:30): Worsening atelectasis in the right lung.
Lucency at right lung apex, without definitive visceral pleural
line identification.  Status post esophagectomy and pullup
procedure.
Improving left pleural effusion and enlarging right pleural
effusion
CXR ([**10-10**]): Bilateral pleural effusions and associated
atelectases in both lower zones.  No pneumothorax.
CXR ([**10-2**]): mild pulmonary edema, moderate bilateral pleural
effusions (R>L)
CXR ([**9-29**]): bilateral pleural effusions (L>R), pulmonary edema
on right side, RLL collapse
.
Cytology [**10-11**] - bronchial brushings - reactive bronchial
epithelial cells.
.
Chest U/S [**10-12**] - bilateral pleural effusions
.
CT-Chest/abd/pelvis - [**10-13**] - Interval decrease in pericardial
effusion and right-sided pleural effusion with left-sided
pleural effusion, not significantly changed. Interval increase
in size of right-sided pneumothorax compared to prior chest CT.
Compressive atelectasis in both lungs with no specific evidence
for aspiration. No evidence of GI or bowel obstruction.
Cholelithiasis. Small nonobstructing stones in the right kidney.
Low attenuation lesion in the left kidney that likely represents
a cyst, that is not fully characterized on this noncontrast
study.
