CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dizziness.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
male who came to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department complaining
of two to three days of heartburn, posterior neck and
scapular pain and dizziness.  The patient had awoken on the
morning on the day of admission and had stepped out of bed
and collapsed on the floor and had found himself unable to
fully orient himself.  The patient remained on the floor for
approximately three hours until he was able to call his
building manager who then called 9-1-1.

When EMS arrived at his home, he was found to have a blood
pressure of 60/40 and a heart rate of 40.  The patient was
brought by ambulance to the [**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department for
further management.

Of note, in the Emergency Department, the patient reported
two to three weeks of nasal discharge, an episode of vomiting
approximately two weeks prior to admission.  The patient
denied fever, chills, or night sweats, denied shortness of
breath, denied abdominal pain, and denied nausea and
vomiting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Suicide attempt, executed elaborate plan in [**2123**]
resulting in hospitalization; the plan involved lying in a
bathtub full of water and dropping a hair dryer into water
which was done but did not result in electrocution.  The
patient then called the suicide hotline and was admitted.
4.  Depression.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amitriptyline 25-50 mg q.h.s.

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 48975**] at the VA, telephone
number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 41354**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  In the
[**Hospital1 18**] Emergency Department, the patient had a temperature of
97.1, heart rate in the 40s, blood pressure 64/40,
respiratory rate 15, 100% oxygen saturation.  General: The
patient was a well-developed, slightly obese, comfortable
male.  HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI.  ENT/NECK:  No jugular venous
distention.  The neck was supple.  Chest/respiratory: Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Bradycardia.
GI:  Soft, nontender, no masses.  Extremities:  No calf
tenderness.  No peripheral edema.  Skin: Dry with no rash.
Neurologic:  The patient was alert and oriented times three.
Speech was fluent.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  The patient was moving all four extremities
bilaterally.

LABORATORY VALUES:  The laboratory values in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
showed CBC with a white blood cell count of 8.4, hematocrit
35.5.  Sodium 131, potassium 6.1, chloride 105, C02 19, BUN
26, creatinine 2.0, platelets 527,000, calcium 8.9, magnesium
1.4, phosphate 3.3.  CK 69, troponin less than 0.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was interviewed in the
Emergency Department and found to be hypotensive and
bradycardiac.  An EKG was performed which showed sinus rhythm
with a bigeminal pattern with intermittent complete left
bundle branch block as well as an increased PR interval.  The
pattern was consistent with a 2:1 block in the His-Purkinje
system.  Somewhat prominent T waves were noted in leads V1
through V3, also raising the question of an acute anterior
wall ischemia.

The patient received fluid resuscitation totaling 7.5 liters.
The patient experienced vomiting and was intubated.  The
patient then had a chest x-ray which showed that the
endotracheal tube and the NG tube that had been place were in
satisfactory position, no pneumothorax, possible aspiration,
and asymmetrical pulmonary edema.  The patient also had a CT
angiogram of the chest and abdomen which showed no evidence
for aortic dissection and aspiration pneumonia.

After intubation in the Emergency Department, the patient's
blood pressure was further maintained with dopamine (40
micrograms maximum) and Levophed (2 micrograms maximum).
Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was given empiric
levofloxacin and vancomycin.  The patient was also given a
stress dose of steroids and admitted to the ICU.  The patient
was found to be hyperkalemic on repeat lab tests,
nonhemolyzed showing a potassium of 5.9 and was given an
insulin, bicarbonate, and calcium gluconate.  The EKG
abnormalities that had been seen then resolved.  The vital
signs upon admission to the ICU showed an oral temperature of
94 degrees, blood pressure 125/68, heart rate 77 on dopamine
and Levophed, an A line and a right IJ replaced.

A bedside echocardiogram showed mild dilation of the left
atrium, normal left ventricular cavity size, mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferolateral
hypokinesis.  The right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion were normal.  Aortic valve leaflets appeared
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation, moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation was seen
which appeared to be due to chordal tethering associated with
the wall motion abnormality.  There was mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension and no pericardial effusion.

Overnight, the patient ruled in for a myocardial infarction
(troponin peak 17.6) and was found to require less and less
pressor support in order to maintain an adequate blood
pressure.  The patient was extubated on hospital day number
two without difficulty in the afternoon and was weaned off
pressors in the morning.

On hospital day number three, blood cultures from the day of
admission became positive showing staphylococcus bacteremia
which was coagulase-negative.  The patient was transferred to
the General Medicine Service on hospital day number five.  A
PICC line was placed for continued IV antibiotics.  During
all this course, the patient had been maintained on
vancomycin, levofloxacin pending susceptibilities.

On hospital day number six, further discussion revealed the
patient had a history of poor insulin injection hygiene.  The
patient reported that he had been doing his insulin
injections intramuscularly in his groin area.  The patient
was not prepping the site in any sterile fashion, was not
prepping the bottles in which he was drawing the insulin.
Furthermore, the patient was using the same needle repeatedly
until it was dull.  The patient estimated he used the same
needle for one to two weeks or approximately 14-30
injections.

The patient was, therefore, provided with teaching regarding
proper insulin injections from the [**Hospital1 18**] Learning Center.  On
hospital day number seven, blood culture susceptibilities
from the day of admission blood cultures showed that the
coagulase-negative staphylococcus was susceptible to
vancomycin.  Recommendations for a total course of two weeks
of levofloxacin and vancomycin for transient bacteremia
secondary to poor insulin injection hygiene and pneumonia.
The patient was set up with an outpatient infusion company in
order to receive the intravenous vancomycin at home.  The
levofloxacin was changed to p.o.   All further blood cultures
after the day of admission were negative.  Urine culture was
negative.

The patient was told to follow-up with his primary care
provider as well as with a cardiologist for evaluation of his
MI in the setting of hypotension.  The patient was discharged
to home in stable condition with visiting outpatient
antibiotic IV infusion.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Severe sepsis.
2.  Myocardial infarction (troponin peak 17.6).
3.  PICC line placement.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged home w
