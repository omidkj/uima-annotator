NOTE:  Admitted before with discharge summary up until
[**2111-6-18**].  This is a continuation of this discharge summary.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  NEUROLOGIC:  The patient's neurological status after the
31st had improved fully.  She is [**Month/Day/Year 3584**] and oriented x3 with
slight changes in her memory, but this issue was resolved by
[**Month (only) **].

2.  CARDIAC:  The patient was watched on cardiac medications.
Blood pressure was monitored.  She did have an episode on
[**2111-6-20**] at night of acute shortness of breath, diaphoresis and
she looked very sick, very tachypneic.  Her saturations were
89% on room air, 94% on 6 liters.  Blood pressure 120/80,
heart rate 70.  Electrocardiogram showed a question of mild
J-point elevation in V2-V3 of 2 mm.  Lung exam revealed poor
air movement, wheezes, decreased breath sounds throughout.
Arterial blood gases:  pH 7.11, PCO2 71, PO2 62.  Aggressive
nebulizers were given.  Gas improved slowly throughout the
course of the night, 40 mg intravenous Lasix and then 120 mg
intravenous Lasix were given.  Chest x-ray showed congestive
heart failure, pulmonary edema and by 3:20 a.m. gas was 7.21,
60, 71 and then by 4:50 a.m. it was improved to 7.23, 56,
119.  The patient was also ruled out for myocardial
infarction.  Troponin was 8; it had been 50 in the past, so
this was actually followed and was found to be trending down
8 to 7 to 6 and her CKs ended up being negative.  The actual
cause of this acute decompensation was not fully known,
probably a combination between congestive heart failure and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare since it improved
with nebulizers and Lasix, not clear which one, but we do not
think she had another cardiac event.

3.  PULMONARY:  For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we
continued her metered dose inhalers and after this one night,
she continued to do well.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  She is on antiretrovirals for human
immunodeficiency virus, Bactrim prophylaxis.

5.  RENAL:  Creatinine continued to trend down.  It went from
5 to 4.6 and remained stable between 4.5 to 4.6 by discharge.

6.  ENDOCRINE:  We continued to check her fingersticks and
regular insulin.  She was on glyburide.  Her sugars were high
and we are continuing to watch and will ask nutrition for
help on a good nutrition supplement for a diabetic.

7.  HEME:  Acquired factor VIII deficiency, now stable.  No
issues.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The changes we made to her medications, she
did well on a stable dose of Lasix 80 mg po qd.  It was an
adequate dose to keep her negative.  She was started on
captopril on [**2111-6-24**], 25 [**Hospital1 **] for renal protection because of
her renal failure and probable diabetic etiology for this
renal failure.  She also is on Procrit and Tums and she is
resisting rehabilitation, but we will try to convince her and
her family that this is the best option for her.  Physical
therapy saw her and agrees that she is not safe to go home by
herself.  She will be discharged to a short term
rehabilitation if her family will agree and if she will agree
pending bed availability.
