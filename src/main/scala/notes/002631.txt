Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to the CCU, an [**Month/Day/Year 461**] was notable for a
dilated left ventricle and severely depressed LVEF of around
20%. Chest and head CT scans were also obtained. The chest scan
revealed diffuse ground glass opacities and bilateral lower lobe
air space disease. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
The head scan was remarkable for two foci of low attenuation,
one within the right subcortical temporal lobe white matter, and
one within the right medial temporal lobe. Both of these may
represent areas of lacunar infarction.

He was concomitantly noted to have a leukocytosis and spiked a
fever to 102.0. He was empirically started on broad spectrum
antibiotics. Pan cultures remained negative. He also experienced
a transient decline in renal function with creatinine peaking to
2.4. Within days, his renal function normalized and his
hypoxia/acidosis improved. He maintained stable hemodynamics and
was eventually extubated on hospital day two. No further
ventricular arrhythmias were noted on telemetry and he remained
pain free. His CK-MB and troponin peaked to 70 and 1.5
respectively.

On [**12-26**], cardiac catheterization revealed severe three
vessel coronary artery disease in a right dominant system. The
left main demonstrated mild diffuse disease. The LAD had a 70%
stenosis after the 1st Diagonal. The D1 was totally occluded and
filled via left to left collaterals. The LCX demonstrates a 40%
proximal lesion along with a totally occluded OM2 that filled
via left to left collaterals. The RCA demonstrated a 70%
proximal lesion along with a total occlusion
of the distal vessel that filled via left to right collaterals.
Repeat [**Month (only) 461**] again showed moderately to severely
depressed left ventricular systolic function of approximately
30-35%. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities included
inferior/inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and distal septal
and apical hypokinesis. There was only mild mitral regurgitation
and mild aortic insufficiency.

He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for CABG when he was medically
ready to go to the OR. He remained in the CCU prior to his
surgery initially and then was transferred to the floor. His
rising WBCs was an issue that prevented him from going to the OR
earlier. There was a question of an aspiration PNA and he
completed abx. Blood and urine cultures were negative. Heparin
turned off several days before surgery. He underwent CABG x3 on
[**1-8**]. He was seen on [**1-9**] by the EP service for evaluation for
possible ICD. It was determined he could see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
one month as an outpatient. Swan and chest tubes were removed on
POD #1. He was extubated and was alert and oriented. He remained
on an amiodarone loading drip and the neo drip was weaned off on
POD #2. He was transferred to the floor in the afternoon.

On the floor he developed a rash on his RUE where the BP cuff
had been. He was given benadryl and lidex cream and had a
dermatology consult. He remained in SR and the amiodarone was
DCed. His leukocytosis was improving and he had no evidence of
active infection. Ibuprofen had been started for a pericardial
rub, but this was stopped the next day when his creatinine rose
to 1.6. This decreased to 1.0 the next day. He had a small
hematoma at the left thigh. Flomax was started for complaints of
difficulty urinating. Diuresis and beta blockade continued and
he was cleared for discharge to home with VNA on [**1-14**].
