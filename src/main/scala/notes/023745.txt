History of Present Illness:
74M with history of HTN, sarcoid and emphysema who presented to
OSH with chest pain and "indigestion." Course at OSH notable for
NSTEMI and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac evaluation.
Onset of CP started on Saturday [**5-10**]. Reports two months of
"indigestion" which responded to TUMS. This time, he ate out at
Friendly's but not relieved by TUMS. Constant mild ache in the
left chest without radiation. At its worst, associated SOB,
nausea and dry heaves. History of chronic non-productive cough
which was increased on admission. Went to covering PCP who
recommended increased steroids, antitiotics. Attempted to take
the medications. However, 4PM on Sunday [**5-11**], he developed dry
heaves so went to an [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital ED. Labs noted for
positive cardiac enzymes. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.
Started on heparin, integrilin.

On the day of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was noted to be
tachypneic; VS: BP 147/87, P=114, RR=28, with 02 sat of 78-88%.
ABG: 7.26/88/70 on 100%. Of note, patient at ABG at OSH which
was 7.34/64/176. He also had coughed up bloody sputum (300 cc).
He was transferred to the CCU for urgent intubation prior to
cath. For intubation, received etomidate, sucs, and started on
propofol for sedation. Noted to have decreased SBP to 40-50s.
Improvement of pressures with levophed, fluids, and off
propofol.

In cath, noted to have 50% distal LMCA (mod calcified), mild
total occlusion LAD, heavily calcified D1 total occ, LCX (mild
av [**Doctor Last Name **] 60-70%, distal AV groove occlusion, major OM2 mid 90%,
OM1/ramus 80%), RCA severely calcified, diffuse plaquing. PCWP
15, PA (54/28 mean 39). Pt dropped SBP to 40 with minimal pulse
pressure A and PA tracings. CPR and epinephrine initiated and
pressures returned with support of dopamine and norepinephrine.
Pt noted to have blood in ETT and pt auto-PEEPed, having to be
removed from vent transiently. IABP placed at 1:3. Transferred
to CCU. Had bronchoscopy performed which showed no endobronchial
lesions, bronchomalasia, and some bilateral hemoptysis L>R.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization [**2183-5-12**]-
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main
coronary artery had a distal 50% stenosis with moderate
calcification.  The LAD had a mid vessel total occlusion with a
heavily calcified D1 total occlusion and faint distal filling.
The LCX had a 60 to 70% stenosis of the AV groove vessel with a
distal total occlusion.  The OM2 had a mid vessel 90% stenosis
and the OM1 had an 80% stenosis at its origin.  The RCA was
severely calcified throughout (though the presence of previously
placed stents could not be excluded) with a 60% stenosis
proximally, 50% stenosis in the mid vessel, and diffuse disease
in the PDA and RPL up to 80%.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed minimally elevated right sided
filling
pressures (mean RA pressure was 9 mm Hg and RVEDP was 11 mm Hg).
Pulmonary artery pressures were moderately elevated (PA pressure
was 50/28 mm Hg).  Left sided filling pressures were minimally
elevated (mean PCW pressure was 15 mm Hg).  Central arterial
pressure was normal (on vasopressors) (aortic pressure was 97/66
mm Hg).  Cardiac index was normal (at 3.3 L/min/m2).
3.  Multiple attempts at crossing the aortic valve were made
including with a straight wire.  The calcified aortic valve was
not able to crossed and thus left ventricular pressures and left
ventriculography were not performed.
4.  Before the case as well as during, the patient had copious
frothy
and blood secretions suctioned from his endotrachael tube.
During one episode of suctioning, the patient was noted to have
a significant drop in his systemic pressures to the 40s systolic
with no palpable pulse. CPR was initiated and his pressures
promptly improved with administration of epinephrine.  The
patient required varying amounts of levophed and dopamine.  At
one point, his pressure was noted to drop into the 80s systolic
and he was removed from mechanical ventilation transiently with
a large gush of expelled air and a prompt improvement in his
blood pressure (suggestive of significant auto-PEEP).  A stat
echocardiogram was performed and revealed depressed myocardial
function, a thickened aortic valve, and a mean aortic valve
gradient of 20 mm Hg. No aortic insufficieny or significant
pericardial effusion was noted. Cardiac surgery was consulted
emergently.  2 units of PRBCs were transfused.  An IABP was
placed though there was no systolic unloading secondary to the
patient's tachycardia.
5.  Post cardiac arrest, the patient had moderately elevated
pulmonary artery pressures (PA pressure was 62/38 mm Hg).  Left
sided filling pressures were moderately to severely elevated
(mean PCW pressure was 28/30 mm Hg).  Cardiac index remained
normal, albeit lower than before the code (at 2.5 L/min/m2).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel and branch coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Moderately to severely elevated left sided filling pressures
post
cardiac arrest.
____________________________________________________
Echo [**2183-5-12**]- 1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.
2. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. There is a tiny to small pericardial effusion, mostly over
the right
ventricle.

ECHO Study Date of [**2183-6-9**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is probably moderately depressed;
ejection fraction difficult to assess due to the presence of
bigeminy (EF ?35%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal.
Right ventricular systolic function is probably mildly
depressedl. There is at least mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild
to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very
small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2183-5-12**], the
studies are technically suboptimal for comparison. Left
ventricular systolic function may be similar but cannot be
adequatley compared give differences in heart rate and rhythm
between the 2 studies.

GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2183-6-4**]
