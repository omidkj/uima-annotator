Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with 2 Cypher stents placed in LAD


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 21136**] is a 57 yo male with PMH significant for DM and
HTN who presents with an STEMI, now s/p cardiac catheterization.
Pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED at 4:30 pm with chest pain. He
describes having 2 episodes earlier this afternoon. The first
occurred at 3pm and lasted for approximately 15-20 minutes
associated with significant diaphoresis. Patient describes the
pain as a discomfort in his chest with a sense of relief when it
went away. He admits to doing some light yardwork prior to the
1st episode but denies any pain at the time. The second episode
occurred at 3:30pm and lasted until his presentation to the ED.
Denies any associated SOB, PND, orthopnea, vomiting, or
lightheadedness.

In the ED his inital vitals were: T 97.9 BP 170/109 AR 82 RR 16
O2 sat 95% RA. EKG showed ST elevations I, aVL, V1-V4 and
reciprocal ST depressions in II, III, & aVF. He was given
Heparin 5000 units SQ, Metoprolol 5mg IV (3 doses),
Nitroglycerin IV, Plavix 75mg, and Integrillin gtt and was taken
immediately to the cath lab.

In the cath lab he was found to have 60% proximal stenosis and
99% stenosis before D1 of the LAD. Two Cypher stents were placed
and patient had immediate relief of his chest pain.

Patient also admits to claudication symptoms in his L leg for
the past 1.5 months. He describes it as crampiness at the bottom
of his calf and is unable to walk more than [**Age over 90 **] yards before he
develops these symptoms. He was hoping to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**] in the
next few weeks.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cardiac catheterization ([**10-2**]): 1. Selective coronary
angiography of this left dominant system revealed 2 vessel
disease. The LMCA has mild disease.  The ostial LAD had a 60%
lesion, followed by 99% lesion immediately before D1 take-off
with TIMI 2 flow.  The mid-distal LAD as well as D1 has diffuse
disease- up to 40% stenosis. The ramus intermedius is a small
caliber vessel and has 50% stenosis.  The LCx is a large vessel
and gives off 3 OMs as well as the L-PDA.  OM2, which is a
moderate caliber vessel, has 60% stenosis in its mid-portion.
The L-PDA has 80% stenosis at its origin as well as a 60%
stenosis in its mid-portion.  The RCA is a small, non-dominant
vessel with diffuse disease. 2. Limited resting hemodynamic
measurement reveals elevated left sided filling pressure with an
LVEDP of 30mmHg. 3. Left ventriculography revealed an ejection
fraction of 40% with anterior lateral and apical akinesis.

2)Cxray ([**10-2**]): Limited study. Low lung volumes. Faint opacity
in left lower lobe.

3)ECHO ([**10-3**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the distal 2/3rds of the anterior septum and
anterior walls, distal inferior wall and apex. The remaining
segments contract well. The apex is heavily trabeculated, but no
intraventricular thrombus is seen. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root, ascending
aorta, and aortic arch are mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Patient is a 57 yo male with DM and HTN who presented with
chest pain and is now s/p cardiac catheterization with 2 stents
placed in the LAD.

1)STEMI: Patient presented to the ED with EKG changes consistent
with an anteroseptal infarction. He underwent urgent cardiac
catheterization with two Cypher stents placed in the LAD and is
currently chest pain free. Also has significant stenosis in the
PDA but no further intervention was done. Currently in sinus
rhythm and euvolemic. He was continued on Integrilin and then
transitioned to Heparin gtt & Coumadin given the increased risk
of a clot given the significant apical akinesis. He was also
started on Plavix 75mg and high dose ASA 325mg, which he should
take for 12 months. Medical management was optimized with
b-blocker, Ace inhibitor, and statin. An ECHO 2 days after the
cath suggested significant anteroseptal akinesis with a
depressed EF. He is being discharged with Lovenox and Coumadin.
I have scheduled him for a repeat ECHO in 4 weeks and have also
scheduled him to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to determine
course of anticoagulation.

2)HTN: Blood pressure was elevated in the ED and remained high
in the CCU. He is on Bisoprolol/HCTZ as an outpatient. This was
changed to Toprol XL 50mg. He was also maintained on his home
dose of Lisinopril 10 mg. He was started on a Nitro gtt in the
ED but was d/c'ed after cath.

3)Peripheral [**Last Name (STitle) **] Disease: Patient is s/p R femoral-tibial
bypass in [**4-1**]. He presents on this admission with claudication
symptoms in his L leg for the past few months. He states that he
is not able to walk more than [**Age over 90 **] yards before developing cramps
in his legs. On exam his left leg was initally cool and the DP
pulse was not dopplerable. We contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] to come by
and see Mr. [**Known lastname 21136**] during his stay in the hospital. He
suggested further work-up with ABI's, U/S of R graft, and
angiogram all of which are scheduled for as an outpatient.

4)Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on outpatient regimen of
Lipitor but dose wa
