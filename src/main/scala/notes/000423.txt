Studies:
[**2189-11-14**] CXR - CONCLUSION:
1. Stable left basal effusion and left lower lobe consolidation.

2. Atelectasis at the right lung base.
3. Increased density and trabeculation in the right humerus is
unchanged and most likely related to Paget's disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo M with PMH of CVA w/residual weakness, CAD s/p stent, h/o
COPD, h/o aspiration PNA and chronic pleural effusion/LLL
collapse presenting with worsened dyspnea and cough over two
weeks, with new Afib w/RVR in the ED.

MICU Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the MICU with worsening and cough for
2 weeks in the setting of Afib with RVR.  His SOB was in the
setting of new onset afib and an 8lb weight gain and it was
believed to due to afib.  He was started on PO Diltiazem 15mg PO
QID but he had converted back to sinus rhythm by the time he
arrived in the ICU.  He was continued on low dose Diltiazem for
control of his afib.  His amlodipine was stopped due to
borderline hypotension in the setting of afib.  He was continued
on his home COPD regimen of Spiriva and Atrovent and also
treated with Albuterol. He is being discharged on albuterol PRN.
 Sputum and blood cultures were obtained and were negative.
Urine legionella was ordered and was negative.  He was given an
insulin sliding scale for his diabetes.  His blood pressure
stayed in the 120s-130s/50s and heart rate remained in the 70s
throughout his MICU stay.
.
# GI Bleed: The patient was transferred to the floor.  He had
been started on a heparin drip and coumadin because of his A
fib.  He began to pass blood and maroon stool through his
ostomy, and thus his heparin and coumadin was stopped.  His HCT
nadired at 25.9 and gradually increased without blood
transfusion to 27.1.  His HCT on admission was 30.7. The maroon
stool resolved and the patient was passing only brown stool and
no blood for the last 3 days prior to discharge.  The goals of
care were discussed with patient and he did not want aggressive
care and he did not want a colonoscopy to investigate the source
of the bleeding.
.
#Dyspnea/cough: The patient's dyspnea and cough were likely due
to his COPD exacerbation in conjunction with his chronic lung
disease.  He has known pleural effusion and long standing
emphysema.  His atrial fibrillation likely exacerbated his
dyspnea by causing some mild pulmonary edema. The patient has
CHF and had an 8 lb weight gain before admission suggesting an
element of heart failure.  He was treated for a COPD
exacerbation with prednisone 60mg x 3 days.  He was given
spiriva, atrovent, and albuterol PRN and was discharged on these
medications.  The patient is at high risk for aspiration and
understands the risk of aspiration but has decided to eat a
regular diet.  His oxygen saturation was 99% on 2L at the time
of discharge.  Please use humidified oxygen as pt requests this
for comfort given that pt has very dry throat.
.
# Afib w/RVR - He presented in A fib with RVR in the ED.  He was
placed on diltiazem.  He was in NSR in the unit and has been
since.  He should be continued on the diltiazem. His amlodipine
was stopped.
.
# CKD - The patient renal function slightly worsened while in
the hospital with a creatinine of 2.1 from a baseline of 1.9.
He was given 1L of NS given that this was thought to be
prerenal.  His creatinine returned to his baseline of 1.9 prior
to discharge.  The patient was continued on metolazone.
.
# Type 2 DM - The patient had several days of high blood sugars,
at times greater than 500, in the setting of being on
prednisone.  His NPH was increased during this time.  He was
discharged on his home regimen of NPH.  His glipizide was held
while in the hospital and restarted on discharge.
.
# Hypertension - The patient has been normotensive since
admission.  He was on amlodipine as an out patient and is now on
diltiazem.
.
# Skin Ulcer - The patient has a stage II cocyx ulcer which
should be cared for as follows: clean with wound cleanser and
pat dry. Use no sting barrier to wipe peri wound tissue and let
dry. Then apply wound gel and cover with Allevyn foam dressing
which should be changed q 3 days.  The patient should be turned
q2hrs and as needed.  He should also be getting up out of bed to
his chair.  Sitting time should be limited to 1 hr at a time
with a 4 inch foam cushion.  He also has skin tears between his
thumb and first finger bilaterally which should be cared for as
follows: on hands bilaterally between thumbs and first finger
has skin tears. Apply aquaphor and 4 x 4 to cover. This should
be changed daily.
