CHEST, SINGLE VIEW:  Heart size and mediastinal borders are
normal.  No focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural
effusion.  No gross osseous abnormality.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

EKG noisy baseline but apparent SR @91bpm, normal axis and
intervals, no s1/q3/t3, no evidence of acute ischemia or strain


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo F longtime smoker with h/o COPD and schizoaffective
disorder per records presented with increased SOB and cough x1
day without fever.

1. Dyspnea: Symptoms were most consistent with COPD
exacerbation. ABG suggested acute respiratory acidosis.
Pneumonia was less likely in absence of fever. Clinically did
not appear volume overloaded, and BNP<450 making CHF
exacerbation less likely. Chest CTA ruled out PE. MI was ruled
out by enzymes. She was treated with BiPAP and found to be
optimal respiratory-wise with O2 saturation in the mid-to-high
80s. She finished a 7-day course of azithromycin and
ceftriaxone. She was given nebulizers and started on prednisone,
which was tapered by discharge. By discharge, she was breathing
comfortably on room air with O2 saturation in mid-to-high 80s.
She underwent pulmonary tests the results of which were still
pending by discharge.

2. Altered mental status: might be due to hypercarbic
respiratory failure on admission versus worsening psychiatric
disorder. She was continued on outpatient thioridazine and
chlordiazepoxide. Her mental status improved to orientation x 3
by discharge.
