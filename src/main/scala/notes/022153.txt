Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath/Heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2157-1-7**] - Urgent mitral valve repair with triangular resection
of middle scallop of the posterior leaflet and annuloplasty with
a 26-mm [**Company 1543**] 3-D annuloplasty ring.

[**2157-1-5**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Delightful 57 year old female with a history of a myxomatous
mitral valve and mitral regurgitation dating back to [**2126**]. She
has been followed for moderate regurgitation and mild pulmonary
hypertension with symptom observation and serial
echocardiography. In [**2156-10-24**] she began to develop
shortness of breath as well as palpitations. Her recent
echocardiogram demonstrated a new partial flail of the posterior
mitral leaflet (probably P2/P3 scallops) with
wide-open MR and new severe pulmonary hypertension. Her left
atrial size had not changed in size thus suggesting the acute
nature of her severe mitral regurgitation. Given these findings,
she has been referred for surgical management. She was
originally seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3067**] in clinic on [**2156-12-30**] hoever
developed worsening shortness of breath and heart failure
neccessitating an earlier admission for surgery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2157-1-5**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically apparent CAD.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate to severe
elevation of
left sided filling pressures (LVEDP of 22mmHg and mean PCWP of
24mmHg).
There was prominent v vave (up to 33mmHg) on PCWP tracing
consistent
with mitral regurgitation. There was moderate pulmonary
hypertension
(50/24mmHg, mean 34mmHg) but right sided filling pressures were
only
mildly elevated (mean RAP of 6mmHg, RVEDP of 10mmHg). Cardiac
index by
Fick was 3L/min/m2. Pulmonary vascular resistance was mildly
elevated at
170 dynes-sec/cm5. There was no transaortic gradient on pullback
of
catheter from LV to aorta.

[**2157-1-6**] Carotid Ultrasound
No evidence of significant carotid artery stenosis

[**2157-1-7**] ECHO
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse.
The mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid annulus is not dilated.There is
no pericardial effusion.

Post bypass

Patient is AV paced and receiving an infusion of phenylephrine.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. Annuloplasty ring
seen in the mitral position. Appears well seated and there is
trivial perivalvular regurgitation.(posterior commissure). Aorta
is intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3069**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-1-5**] for surgical
management of her mitral valve disease. In preparation for
surgery, she underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed
clean coronaries. On [**2157-1-7**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 3069**] was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a mitral valve repair. Please
see operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to
the intensive care unit for monitoring. She later awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. On postoperative day
one, she was transferred to the step down unit for further
recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility. She did
complain of left thumb numbness on post operative day 4 which
was thought to be secondary to radial nerve irritation with an
echymotic area noted.  She had 2+ bilateral radial artery pulses
with good capillary refill.  She was told to contact the service
if the numbness continued or worsened after discharge.  She
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day 4. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 171**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
