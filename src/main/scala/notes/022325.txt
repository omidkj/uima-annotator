Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital6 33**] after PEA arrest in the field


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
History obtained from OSH and prior [**Hospital1 **] records.
This is a 64 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG in
[**2135**], left main and left circ stents by Dr. [**Name (NI) **], unclear dates,
chf with depressed left ventricular systolic function, ef 35%,
dm, carotid artery disease, pvd, subclavian stenosis s/p stents
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] after having PEA arrest at
home. Patient reported to his wife feeling like he was going to
die and subsequently lost consciousness. EMS summoned by wife.
According to EMS report, patient without pulse or respiration,
full ALS initiated, patient intubated in the field, multiple
rounds of epi and atropeine administered. Brought to ER with cpr
in progress, PEA. Ultimately regained pulse. Conflicting reports
as to amount of time down 8-25 minutes.

At [**Hospital3 **] his ECG reportedly (no ekg's sent with wide
complex tachycardia) initially showed a wide complex
tachycardia, with RBBB, LPFblock, st depr in I and avl and old
anteroseptal MI. He was given amio 300mg IV and then developed a
junctional rhythm with no pulse and required repeated
resucitation. He was placed on a levophed drip and an
echocardiogram was performed. It showed inferobasilar infarct,
dilated left ventricle, small pericardial effusion. Found to
have a marked metabolic acidosis. Runs of NSVT.

Head CT without acute CNS event. Possible seizure activity
noted.

He was seen by cardiology who felt acute MI was unlikely, data
consistent with old MI

Also seen by neurology who was concerned for anoxic
encephalopathy and secondary seizure activity and recommended
seizure prophylaxis with fosphenytoin and support for 24-48 to
allow for further assessment of anoxic injury. Poor prognosis.

Patient has not regained conscousness since the arrest,
unresponsive to noxious stimuli and was noted to have focal
twitching of face and arms.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64 year-old man with history of CAD s/p CABG and
stents, carotid, subclavian and pvd, dm, cri transferred from
[**Hospital1 34**] after pea arrest [**7-2**] afternoon at home. Now intubated, on
levophed with no response to noxious stimuli and non-reactive
pupils.

S/p arrest: Unclear etiology, primary cardiac event vs.
metabolic causes given CAD and CRI. EKG's do not show evidence
of new event, more consistent with old MI's. Enzymes
unimpressive from OSH for infarct--trop of 0.43 s/p arrest with
negative CK and MB. Head CT negative at OSH. was on pressor and
ventilatory support. also on fosphenytoin as reportedly had
seizure activity at [**Hospital1 34**] and was seen by neuro who recommended
fosphenytoin.

CV: ischemia: significant CAD history as noted, unclear if had
another event but ekg, echo done at [**Hospital1 34**] consistent with old
MI's, enzymes unimpressive and in setting of s/p arrest. CK neg
x 3. trop +ve x 3. continued on aspirin, plavix, statin. no
beta, ace given hypotension/need for pressor support.

pump: hypotension: history of depressed ef, appeared to be
mildly fluid overloaded, hypotensive-was on pressor support.
neuro cause vs. card shock.; continued on
pressor support

rhythm: no acute issues

Neuro: likely anoxic encephalopathy with ?seizure
activity--twitches
No pupillary reflexes, no response to noxious stimuli. Poor
prognosis. was on bedside EEG telemetry. started on phenytoin
for seizure prophylaxis.

DM:insulin gtt given critical illness

Vascular: continued aspirin, plavix given history of subclav and
coronary stents--not exactly sure of timing of stents, no
evidence of bleeding at this time

resp: intubated in setting of arrest, weaning limited primarily
by mental status

GI prophylaxis: protonix

DVT prophylaxis:subcu heparin
