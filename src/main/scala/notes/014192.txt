her usual good state of health when a week ago she began to have
malaise and HA.  As the week  progressed her malaise and HA

was AZT monotherapy, stc, NVP(severe myalgias), IDV, saquinavir,

d4t, and nelfinavir. she was on d4t/3tc/nfv from 99 through 01
with cd4 400s-800s and vl <10K. Genotype done on this regimen
reportedly showed 3tc, ddi, and several PI mutations; these are
not specifically documented. Meds stopped in the context of
treating hep C; reinitiated ARVs in [**9-23**] with tdf/3tc/rtv/atv.

[**3-22**] but VL rebound to 14 million in [**9-22**]; 18.6 million in
[**2-23**]. followed by dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Signs of advancing liver disease
with palmar erythema, spider angiomata, SM, thrombocytopenia.
u/s shows cirrhosis with no focal liver masses, splenomegaly,
patent portal vein. estimated portal pressure not documented,
but +gastropathy on EGD. labs show mild transaminitis (ast>alt)
and alk phos elevation, total bili intially normal now elevated
in the setting atazanavir. Of note, she undergoing HIV/SOT
transplant evaluation and followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in
