Bone marrow Biopsy:
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:



DIAGNOSIS:

Involvement by ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, see note.



Note:

By morphology this would be best classified as AML with minimal
maturation (FAB-AML subclass M2). Background dysplasia is noted,
and correlation with clinical and cytogenetic findings is
recommended to assess for an antecedent myelodysplastic process.
Correlation with clinical, cytogenetics and molecular findings
is necessary for exact WHO subclassification.



MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Peripheral Blood Smear:

The smear is adequate for evaluation. Erythrocytes are decreased
in number, normochromic, and exhibit anisopoikilocytosis
including ovalocytes, microcytes are rare dacryocyte.  Numerous
(8 per 100 WBCs) nucleated red cells, including some with
asymmetric nuclear budding are noted. Polychromatophils and
cells with coarse basophilic stippling are also seen. The white
blood cell count appears increased.  Pelgeroid hypogranular
neutrophils are seen. Platelet count appears decreased; large
forms are seen; giant forms are not present.

Differential count shows 1% neutrophils, 2% monocytes, 15%
lymphocytes, 80% blast, 2% myelocytes.  Blasts have scant amount
of cytoplasm, high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, large
round-to-oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli.  Occasional cells
with cytoplasmic granules and occasional vacuoles are seen.



Aspirate Smear:

The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation and consists of
abundant cellular spicules. The M:E ratio is 0.6:1. Erythroid
precursors are decreased with dyspoietic maturation; forms with
irregular nuclear contour and asymmetric nuclear budding are
seen.   Myeloid precursors appear markedly increased in number
and consists predominantly of blasts. Megakaryocytes are not
seen.

Differential shows: 60% Blasts, 1% Promyelocytes, 3% Myelocytes,
6% Bands/Neutrophils, 1% Plasma cells, 12% Lymphocytes, 17%
Erythroid.

Blasts are morphologically similar to those seen in the
peripheral smear.  Occasional clusters of plasma cells are seen.




Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:

The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation.   It is a 1.5 cm
core biopsy consisting of trabecular bone and marrow material.
The cellularity is greater than 90% and consists predominantly
of a population of immature cells with a moderate amount of
eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio and prominent nucleoli.  The immature cells
occupy greater than 80% of marrow cellularity.

Erythroid precursors are markedly decreased and show atypical
forms with irregular nuclear membrane and asymmetric nuclear
budding. Maturing myeloid precursors are markedly decreased.
Megakaryocytes are markedly decreased.

A small non-paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate comprised of small
lymphocytes is present and accounts for less than 5% of the
marrow cellularity.

Marrow clot section is similar to the biopsy.

Touch prep is similar to the aspirate.

Special Stains:

Iron stain is adequate for evaluation.  Storage iron is
decreased.   Sideroblasts are present many with increased
siderotic granules.  Ringed sideroblasts are absent.

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  HLA-DR,
Glycophorin A, Kappa, lambda; and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8,
10, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 33, 34, 41, 45, 56, 64, 71, 117.

RESULTS:

Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize blast yield.

Cell marker analysis demonstrates that the majority of the cells
isolated from this bone marrow are in the CD45-dim, low
side-scatter 'blast' region. They express immature antigens
CD34, HLA-DR (subset; 56%) along with myeloid associated
antigens CD33, CD117, CD11c (subset, dim) and CD71. They
additionally co-express CD7 (dim).  A minor subset (17%) dimly
co-express CD19.  They lack other B and T cell associated
antigens, are CD10 (cALLa) negative and are negative for CD13,
CD14, CD15, CD56, CD64,  and Glycophorin A.  Blast cells
comprise 65% of total events.

Lymphoid cells comprise 4% of total gated events.  B cells
comprise 10% of lymphoid-gated events, are polyclonal, and do
not express aberrant antigens.   T cells comprise 65% of
lymphoid gated events and express mature lineage antigens, and
have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 102 (usual range in 0.7-30).

INTERPRETATION

Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by an
acute myeloid leukemia.

CYTOGENETICS

KARYOTYPE: 46,XX[15]

INTERPRETATION:
This karyotype is characteristic of a chromosomally
normal female.

No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified
in metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated
specimen. This normal result does not exclude a
neoplastic proliferation.

Small chromosome an
