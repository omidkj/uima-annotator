History of Present Illness:
64 yo woman w/ h/o recurrent PEs s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter, GIB
while anticoagulated, COPD, who was discharged [**2107-1-12**] after
being treated for new PE presented to the ED with SOB and
productive cough. She was readmitted [**2107-1-17**] after she was
found to have a multifocal pneumonia and was treated with
Levo/Flagyl and Vanco. Cultures were positive for MRSA. Levo and
Flagyl were continued for suspected aspiration PNA. The pt
recovered quickly over since admission and she is now back on
her home O2 requirement. She was getting bridged for her
anticoagulation with Lovenox starting [**1-18**] in preparation for
discharge.  However, she developed severe abdominal pain and a
palpable mass in her L abdomen. A CT was showed a new large
hematoma in the muscles of the left anterior and lateral lower
abdominal and pelvic wall, without any intraperitoneal or
retroperitoneal extent, but with associated mass effect on the
lower abdominal and pelvic bowel loops. Surgery was [**Month/Year (2) 4221**]
and suggested no intervention, but monitoring for now. HCT
dropped 6 points in this setting, but she remained
hemodynamically stable with tachycardia which has been present
throughout her hospital stay (95-115).

She required a total of 5 units PRBC and 4 units FFP
transfusions and was transferred to the MICU for further
monitoring.  Her hematocrit has since been stable with serial
checks.
.
ROS: She has baseline left to mid chest pain with exertion that
is not currently bothering her. She denies current chest pain,
SOB, dysuria, increased urinary frequency. She has stable R knee
pain.

CTA chest:
1. Interval development of patchy areas of consolidation with
mucous plugging, particularly in the right lower lobe, right
upper and mid lobes suggest a new infectious process or
aspiration.
2. Resolution of the previously identified pulmonary embolism.
3. Extensive centrilobular and paraseptal emphysematous change.
4. Fluid-attenuating structure adjacent to the right T11-12
neural foramen is also unchanged and could be a perineural cyst.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. New large hematoma in the muscles of the left anterior and
lateral lower abdominal and pelvic wall, without any
intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal extent, but with associated
mass effect on the lower abdominal and pelvic bowel loops.
2. Unchanged infectious or inflammatory opacities in the right
middle and lower lobes.
.
[**2107-2-1**] IR Embolization: 1. Right inferior epigastric
arteriogram demonstrates no extravasation of contrast and
successful embolization with Gelfoam until stagnation of flow.
2. The right internal mammary artery demonstrated no areas of
active extravasation of contrast.
.
[**2107-2-3**] CXR: There is an irregular opacity in the right lower
lobe
concerning for pneumonia.  There are no pleural effusions.
There is no
pneumothorax.  The left subclavian catheter tip overlies the mid
SVC.  Heart size normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are
normal. IMPRESSION:  Opacity in the right lower lobe concerning
for pneumonia.
.
[**2107-2-8**] LENIS: Extensive occlusive thrombus is demonstrated from
the common femoral vein at the takeoff of the greater saphenous
vein extending distally to the popliteal veins bilaterally.  No
color flow, compressibility, or waveforms are demonstrated
within these areas of thrombus. IMPRESSION:  Extensive,
completely occlusive, bilateral deep venous thrombi extending
from the common femoral veins to the popliteal veins.
.
[**2107-2-9**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia, Normal ECG except for rate


Brief Hospital Course:
64F w/ h/o recurrent PE s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 260**] filter, GIB on
anticoagulation, COPD, recently admitted for new PE, readmitted
for multifocal PNA, who developed a large abdominal wall
hematoma in the context of enoxaparin injections.

# Multifocal Pneumonia: She was admitted with multifocal
pneumonia. She was started on levofloxacin and vancomycin.  She
completed a 7 day course of levofloxacin.  MRSA was found to
grow in her sputum so she was continued on a 14 day course of
vancomycin. She originally presented with elevated WBC count and
left shift which quickly resolved with the initiation of
antibiotics.  Her productive cough improved as well and she
remained on her baseline home O2 of 2L.  Approximately 4 days
after completion of her 14 day course of Vancomycin, the patient
developed worsening cough, SOB, and upper respiratory symptoms.
A repeat CXR showed evidence of a new consolidation in the RLL.
The patient was started back on Levofloxacin/Flagyl.  Vancomycin
was added to her regimen when blood cultures showed 2/4 bottles
