Brief Hospital Course:
#Respiratory failure. Potentially multifactorial, predominantly
in setting of fluid overload from under-dialyzing.  In the
emergency room, patient became acutely short of breath.  He was
intubated and transfered to the ICU.  Pt had dialysis on first
and second day of admission.  After first session, pt tolerated
spontaneous breathing trial and was extubated. Had HD on day 1
with 4.6 kg removed. Pt had HD with 5 kg removed on day 2.
Repeat CXR demonstrated marked improvement in overload and she
was transfered to the medical floor.  On the medical floor, she
seemed back to baseline respiratory status.  She was able to
ambulate without dropping her sats.
.
#Hyperkalemia. Peak K 7.1, peaked T waves on ECG. K decreased
with medical management.  Pt's K stabilized with HD and was 4.0
at the time of discharge.
.
#HTN. Has history of HTN. Hypertensive urgency/emergency in ED
with SBP to 260s. Possibly multifactorial given history of panic
attacks/anxiety, ? med compliance, possible volume overload.  BP
decreased with HD but rebounded to systolics of 200 with HR
around 100 in the unit.  Nitro gtt d/c'd after initiation of HD
but then restarted initially before being dc'd again. Pt with
known  hx of cocaine use, however tox sceens here were negative.
Pt was initially started on labetalol at 50 PO BID with
inadequate HTN control and then BP was controlled effectively
with labetalol 100 PO BID.  She was restarted on her home meds
on the medical floor and her pressure was well controlled at the
time of discharge.
.
#ESRD on HD. Per OMR notes likely due to hypertensive
nephropathy. Typically gets HD in [**Location (un) **] MWF. Per dialysis
clinic pt frequently misses sessions or shows up late for
sessions.  She recieved dialysis in house with success.  Her
calcium acetate was increased because of increased phosphate.
She will resume her regular dialysis schedule as an outpatient.

.
#Asthma. Continued home meds: fluticasone, ipratropium,
albuterol
.
#HIV  -under control per last ID note, Continued ARVs
.
#Anxiety/Depression  continued clonazepam, fluoxetine
.
#BRCA:  continued arimidex.  Timing of surgery should be
discussed with her PCP and surgeon
.
#Anemia. Recent baseline HCT low to mid 30s, 29 and stable at
time of discharge.  Her HCT should be followed by her PCP
