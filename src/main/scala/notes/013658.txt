Chief Complaint:
Pt. pulled out PICC line at NH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
75 y/o female with COPD, OSA, T2DM, HTN, CHF EF 40%, frequent
UTIs, CAD, and CKD who presents with altered mental status in
the setting of receiving Ativan in the ED. Patient was recently
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory failure in the setting of a
pneumonia/COPD flare, as well as an ESBL UTI, and was discharged
yesterday to rehab to complete a course of
piperacillin-tazobactam. In the interim, she self-discontinued
her PICC line and was brought back to the ED to have it
replaced. She had a chest CT performed in the ED, prior to which
she received 1 mg of Ativan at 9 am in the morning. It appears
that patient refused the CT scan despite much convincing and
started pulling off her leads, and was subsequently given 1 mg
Ativan prior to the CT scan. She was then noted by RN notes to
be "sleeping" until her admission 3 hours later to 11R, where
she was noted to be obtunded. She was given two doses of
flumazenil, to which she had response for approximately 15
seconds before falling asleep again. She was also noted to be
hypoglycemic to 53 as well as hypothermic to 90.3 orally.
