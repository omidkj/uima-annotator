Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59M PMH NSCLC--Stage IIIA currently undergoing chemo and
XRT, COPD, CAD s/p CABG, p/w acute onset SOB.
.
DYSPNEA: Likely COPD exacerbation as pt has known lung disease.
Peak flow is 325 and expected is approx 525. Pt does not have
sob and o2 sats are 97% on RA with ambulation. Wheezing is
improving and chest CT only showed emphysema and known right
hilar mass which is unchanged. ENT did laryngoscopy and did not
see upper airway obstruction. Lung scan low prob for PE. Patient
was treated with prednisone 60 mg-->40 mg, around the clock
atrovent/albuterol nebs, advair and levaquin as this was thought
to be a COPD exacerbation. Patient improved on this regimen,
normal o2 sats but still very wheezy.
*
RENAL FAILURE: Baseline ill-defined, but appears to be around
1.5-2.0. Creatinine trended down to baseline.
*
Schizophrenia- cont fluphenazine, olanzapine and ativan prn
.
Dysphagia- oral ulcers in posterior oropharynx c/w fungal
infection and then patient had tongue ulcers that looked
herpetic. Preliminary viral culture of the lesions was negative
for herpes. Speech and swallow evaluation was normal and
laryngoscopy showed normal vocal cord movement. Patient treated
with roxicet for pain control and discharged on oxycodone as his
dysphagia improved. He was also treated with fluconazole and
acyclovir for two weeks empirically as he was neutropenic.
*
Hypothyroid- levothyroxine
*
NEUTROPENIA: Likely [**2-29**] chemotherapy
*
LUNG CA: As above, defered treatment to primary oncology team.
*
CAD: Cont Plavix. ASA allergy. On HCTZ and valsartan for HTN
control.
