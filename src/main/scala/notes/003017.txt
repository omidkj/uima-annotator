Date of Birth:   [**2059-11-3**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mitral valve disease.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
male with a prior cardiac history including ASD repair in
[**2099**], mitral valve disease, atrial fibrillation/flutter,
status post ablation.  He was followed by serial
echocardiograms and a recent echocardiogram showed EF greater
than 55% with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.  He
was schedule for mitral valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mitral valve disease, atrial
fibrillation, status post ablation.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  ASD repair in [**2099**].

ALLERGIES:  None known.

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin 325 mg q d, Zestril 10 mg q d,
Amiodarone 200 mg q d.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent mitral valve
replacement with a #27 mosaic valve on [**2119-5-1**].  He was
transferred to the CSRU post-operatively.  He was A-paced on
arrival in the CSRU with intermittent loss of capture, with
hypotension.  His underlying rhythm was junctional in the
40's.  AV pacing was attempted but ventricular ectopic
activity occurred.  There was loss of both A and V capture
with inappropriate sensing despite various measures.  He
continued to be bradycardic with hypotension.  He was started
on Dopamine, and emergent pacing Swan was placed with
appropriate pacing and sensing.  He was also started on
Dopamine drip.  He was extubated later on in the same day.
His hemodynamic status stabilized.  He was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] who is his regular electrophysiologist.
Subsequently he continued to be V paced with complete heart
block.  He was continued on his Amiodarone.  A tentative
decision was made for pacemaker placement because of the
complete heart block.  On postoperative day #3 he had
converted to a junctional rhythm and was maintaining his
blood pressure.  He was transferred to the regular floor on
postoperative day #3 in a junctional rhythm with pacing
wires.  He was hemodynamically stable at this point.  On
postoperative day #4 he converted to atrial fibrillation.
His Amiodarone dose was increased per EP and he was started
on a Heparin infusion.  Decision was made for cardioversion
on [**2119-5-8**].  The following days he remained hemodynamically
stable while awaiting therapeutic PTT with Heparin and he
continued to be in atrial fibrillation.  On [**2119-5-8**],
postoperative day #7, he underwent cardioversion
successfully.  He converted to a sinus rhythm with a
prolonged PR interval.  He was stable with this rhythm.  He
was deemed ready for discharge by both electrophysiology and
cardiac surgery on postoperative day #8.  He was discharged
home on postoperative day #8.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 20 mg q day times one week, KCL
20 mEq q d times one week, Colace 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], Aspirin,
enteric coated, 325 mg q d, Amiodarone 400 mg q d for one day
followed by 200 mg q d, duration to be decided by EP,
Percocet 1-2 tablets q 4-6 hours prn.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) **]P:  His primary care physician in two weeks, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks.
