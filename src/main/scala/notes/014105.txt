[**2188-7-20**] Radiology CHEST (PA & LAT)
FINDINGS: Pleural effusions have increased in size since prior,
right greater than left. This is not accompanied by increased
distention of the pulmonary vasculature. The frontal perspective
is in a more lordotic position. Due to the sizable pleural
effusions, it is not possible to determine evolution of
underlying air space disease. No new sites of air space disease
in the upper lungs. IMPRESSION:
