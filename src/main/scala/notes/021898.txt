Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13534**] is a 73
year-old female with a past medical history remarkable for
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery
disease and type 2 diabetes who has been experiencing
worsening exertional angina for the past several years.  The
patient has noted that the pain is currently occurring once
monthly with exertion typically located midsternal and
radiating to the back.  A stress test that was done on [**2119-5-11**] showed the patient had [**Street Address(2) 48360**]
depressions during stage 2 exercise while the patient
developed chest pain consistent with prior anginal symptoms.
Imaging during this period revealed an inferolateral and
apical ischemia with an EF of 78%.  At this time the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization for further evaluation for
coronary revascularization.  The patient's left anterior
descending coronary artery showed 80% compromise, LCX showed
80% compromise and right coronary artery showed 80%
compromise with an EF of 60%.  Given these findings the
decision was made to take the patient back to the Operating
Room for three vessel disease coronary artery bypass graft on
[**5-18**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Gastritis.

2.  Left knee replacement.
3.  Hysterectomy.
4.  Bilateral leg stripping.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has been married living with her
husband, two children.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d.
2.  Glucotrol 10 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Folate 1 q.d.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.
5.  Vitamin E 400 international units q.d.
6.  Monopril 5 mg po q.d.
7.  Coreg 3.125 po b.i.d.
8.  Albuterol prn.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of discharge the patient's
temperature 98.9, pulse 63, blood pressure 112/37,
respirations 18, 97% on room air.  The patient is a well
developed, well nourished female in no acute distress at the
time of discharge.  HEENT sclera anicteric.  Cranial nerves
II through XII intact.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.  Mucous
membranes are moist.  No evidence of oral ulcers.  Chest
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Regular rate and rhythm.
Sternotomy site without any evidence of erythema and no
evidence of serosanguinous drainage.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds and no
evidence of inguinal lymphadenopathy.  Lower extremity had no
evidence of edema and graft site shows good healing without
any evidence of ulceration, erythema or serosanguinous
drainage.

LABORATORY:  CBC white blood cell count 9.8, hematocrit 31.1,
platelets 217, sodium 143, potassium 4.3, chloride 105,
bicarb 26, BUN 27, creatinine 1.2, glucose 133.  Magnesium
1.9.  The laboratory values were of [**2119-5-26**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 73 year-old female with a
past medical history remarkable for coronary artery disease,
type 2 diabetes and worsening anginal symptoms with cardiac
catheterization to find three vessel disease of left anterior
descending coronary artery, LCX, right coronary artery.  On
[**2119-5-19**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
graft times two with left internal mammary coronary artery to
left anterior descending coronary artery, saphenous vein
graft to right posterior descending coronary artery (lesser
saphenous) without complications.  Postoperatively, the
patient was taken to TSRU for close observation and extubated
on postoperative day number one and was saturating well.  On
postoperative day number two the patient developed acute
agitation, which required 40 mg of Haldol to maintain the
patient sedated.  Because the patient's confusion status
correlated well with narcotic administration all narcotics
and benzodiazepines were discontinued at this time.  A few
hours thereafter the patient's confusion status resolved and
the patient continued to improve postoperatively.  By
postoperative day number three the decision was made to
transfer the patient to the floor since the patient's mental
status had returned back to baseline and no additional Haldol
was necessary.  Furthermore the patient's Lopressor was
initiated successfully maintaining the heart rate at 60s to
70s without resulting in significant compromise of the blood
pressure.  The patient was also restarted on Plavix and
Glucotrol along with diet as tolerated.

On postoperative day number four the patient was evaluated by
physical therapy and was deemed to have achieved level five.
Shortly thereafter the patient's cardiac rhythm became
irregular and the patient developed atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response.  20 mg of Lopressor along with
total of 300 mg of Amiodarone bolus was administered.
Approximately three hours after the atrial fibrillation began
rate was controlled and the rhythm spontaneously reverted
back to normal sinus.  By postoperative day number seven the
decision was made to discharge the patient to home in good
condition, because the patient had not had any arrhythmias
for 48 hours after spontaneously reverting to normal sinus
rhythm.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Status post coronary artery bypass graft with saphenous vein
graft to right posterior descending coronary artery (lesser
saphenous).

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg po q.d. times seven days.
2.  Potassium chloride 20 meq po q.d. times seven days.
3.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d.
4.  Glipizide 10 mg po b.i.d.
5.  Amiodarone 400 mg po q.d.
6.  Metoprolol 75 mg po b.i.d.
7.  Vioxx 12.5 mg po q.d.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  The patient was instructed to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in six weeks and her cardiologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 48361**] in one week.
