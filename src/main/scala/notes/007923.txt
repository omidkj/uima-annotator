Chief Complaint:
ICD lead extraction and reimplantation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator lead extraction and
reimplantation


History of Present Illness:
77 year old man with hx of ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 30%, s/p
CABG [**2155**], COPD, prior CVA, Atrial Fibrillation, CKD, and a
prior dual chamber ICD referred for lead extraction and
reimplantation due to A and V lead fracture.  Under general
anesthesia, his A and V leads were removed and a new ICD device
was placed without complications.  His ICD has not fired in
several years since the amiodarone was started.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint pains.  He does
have a chronic intermittently productive cough.  No hemoptysis.
No black stools or red stools, but has some constipation.  He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  He does have SOB when
walking up his 13 stairs or walking [**1-2**] block.  He used to have
angina although this is much improved on ranolazine.  +
orthopnea (sleeps in recliner), no PND.  No current CP, SOB, no
palpiations, syncope, no new ankle edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 50479**] is a 77 year old man with history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy EF 30%, s/p CABG, COPD, prior CVA, Atrial
Fibrillation, CKD, and a prior dual chamber ICD referred for
lead extraction and reimplantation due to A and V lead fracture.

.
ICD Lead Fracture:  Under general anesthesia and subclavian
approach, his A and V leads were extracted and a new dual
chamber Guidant ICD implant was placed without immediate
complications.  He received one dose of Vancomycin and was
started on a 7 day course of clindamycin.  His warfarin will be
held 7 days post-operatively to help prevent bleeding in the
pacer pocket.  Post-implantation CXR showed proper lead
placement, mild pulmonary edema and a small left pleural
effusion.  He will follow up at our device clinic on [**2168-9-22**].
.
The patient's other medical issues including coronary artery
disease, chronic systolic dysfunction with EF 30%, atrial
fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, COPD, hypertension,
hypothyroidism were managed medically with his home medications
without complications.
.
The patient was found to have a normocytic anemia that is most
likely secondary to chronic renal insufficiency and/or anemia of
chronic inflammation.  He did not have any signs of acute
bleeding, but this should
