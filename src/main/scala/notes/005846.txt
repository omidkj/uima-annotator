Increasing DOE and fatigue


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Redo sternotomy with aortic valve replacement with 19 mm
    [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna ease tissue valve.

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old female who is
status post coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2165**]. Since that
time she has been followed for aortic stenosis. An echo from
[**2179-9-21**] showed severe aortic stenosis with a mildly diminshed
left ventricular function. She also has known vein graft
disease.
Prior to her redo operation, she underwent successful PCI of the
SVG-RCA graft with 3.0x15mm bare metal stent in [**2179-11-9**].
Currently, her symptoms include dyspnea with minimal exertion
along with a generalized fatigue. **She is on Plavix at this
time.**

Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with dyskinesis/aneurysm of
inferior base and severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral wall
and remaining inferior wall. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35%). The remaining
left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results in the OR.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is receiving epinephrine at 0.03 ucg/kg/min
LV systolic function remains essentially unchanged in the
setting of low dose inotropes (LVEF~35%). RV systolic function
remains preserved. There is a ring prosthesis in the mitral
position. There is trace MR. There is a well seated, well
functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. No AI is
visualized. The remaining study is unchanged from prebypass.
