History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59777**] is a 85 yo male with pmh of metastatic procedure
pouch 3 weeks ago transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to ERCP for
suspected cholangitis.  He had been admitted on [**8-21**] to an OSH
with an obstructing mass in his sigmoid colon s/p Hartmen's
procedure, small bowel resection, and cecostomy.  His course
there was complicated by respiratory failure and he was
intubated for almost two weeks.  He was eventually discharged to
Rehab on [**9-9**].  On [**9-14**] he developed chills and shortness of
breath and he was hypoxic to the 70's and tachycardic to the
120s.  He was taken to an OSH ED on a NRB for evaluation.  There
he was found to have an elevated Tbili of 4.1.  An abdominal US
showed a dilated CBD with sludge.  He was started on zosyn and
given 2.5L IVF.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED due to
concern for cholangitis for possible ERCP.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:99.8 P:103 BP:105/51 R:20 O2:98%
on RA sat. Patient was given 1L NS and 1 unit PRBCs for HCT
22.8.  Initial T. Bili was 4.1.  The patient was admitted to the
ICU on the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**].  His VS remained stable, he was
transfused another unit of PRBCs and this morning he was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to ERCP.
.
The patient was immediately taken down for ERCP where he was
found to have two stone, had sphicterotomy and stent placement.
When he returned he was alert and oriented but sleepy, he denied
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  He complained of thirst.

Pertinent Results:
ERCP: Impression: Normal major papilla Multiple stones that were
causing partial obstruction were seen at the biliary tree. The
CBD measured 10mm. The intrahepatic bile ducts were mildly
dilated. The stones were large and will require lithotripsy
prior to removal. Due to the patient's clinical condition,
lithotrpisy was not performed today.  A sphincterotomy was
performed in the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over
an existing guidewire.  A 5cm by 10FR double pig tail biliary
stent was placed successfully (sphincterotomy, stent placement)
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations: NPO overnight and keep well hydrated on i.v.
fluids. At the discretion of the primary team, juices P.O. may
be started in A.M. and diet may be advanced as tolerated if
stable and pain-free.
No aspirin, plavix, NSAIDS, coumadin for 72 hours.
Repeat ERCP in one month for lithotripsy and stone extraction.

Liver/Gallbladder U/S: 1. The common bile duct is not dilated
given the patient's age and postcholecystectomy state, however,
there is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, as well as
small stones or sludge balls in the distal common bile duct, as
seen on earlier same night outside hospital ultrasound.
2. Multiple liver lesions redemonstrated, as seen on outside
hospital CT
scans dating back to [**2109-8-21**]. Given the recent diagnosis of
colon cancer,
these are suspicious for metastatic disease. Trace perihepatic
fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59777**] is an 85 year old male with colon and prostate CA
and recent hospitalization for bowel resection for obstructing
mass who was found to be hypoxic at rehab, OSH abdominal U/S
showed dilated CBD and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.  PAtient
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to procedure given his relative
hypotension.
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course:
# Common bile duct stone/cholangitis:  S/P ERCP with
sphicterotomy and stent for 2 stones and residual sludge/stone.
Post ERCP patient remained abdominal pain free, normotensive and
afebrile.  He was initially kept NPO post procedure and his diet
was advanced the next morning.  He remained on unasyn for
antibiotic coverage of cholangitis and the morning post ERCP was
stable for transfer to the floor.
.
#Hypokalemia: Thought to be due to GI losses, given his high
ostomy output and he remained asymptomatic.  His potassium was
repleted without difficulty.
.
# Anemia:  Unclear etiology, may have been some component of
hemodilution but unlikely to cause such low levels.  He was
transfused 2 units PRBC with an appropriate rise in his Hct,
which then remained stable.  He may benefit from further
outpatient management of his anemia.
