Service:  OMED

HISTORY OF ILLNESS:  This patient is a 58-year-old woman with
a complicated hospitalization originally admitted for
debulking nephrectomy of the right kidney on [**2196-7-18**].  She
was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma in [**1-/2196**] after
having shortness of breath and anemia refractory to
intravenous iron.  MBS was found on bone marrow biopsy.  The
patient developed congestive heart failure at that time
through idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and
hepatosplenomegaly was found back on a CT scan that was done
in 02/[**2195**].  During that CT scan a right renal mass was
located.  Biopsy revealed renal cell carcinoma.  Patient was
also noted to have lung metastases, but a clear report of
this diagnosis is not well elucidated.

POST SURGICAL CARE AFTER HER NEPHRECTOMY ON [**2196-7-18**]:
1.  Was complicated by congestive heart failure and a 15
liter fluid overload.
2.  A left IJ clot after line placing requiring
anticoagulation and leading to hematoma at nephrectomy site
that required a 10-unit transfusion until stable.
3.  A 21-day intubation with multiple failed attempts
secondary to pulmonary edema.
4.  Recurrent hypertension urgency after extubation.
5.  Profound anxiety that was difficult to control as the
patient is intolerant, having paradoxical reactions to
benzodiazepines.

Patient recently had mental status changes in the Critical
Care Unit and had a head CT through which new brain
metastases were diagnosed.

Patient was admitted to the Oncology Medicine service on
[**2196-8-17**].  Prior to the admission, 29 days prior to this,
patient could ambulate well while walking for 30 minutes
without shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, or pain.
She had normal coronary arteries per catheterization at [**Hospital 336**]
Hospital in [**1-/2196**], and she had lost 30 pounds within six
months, and had presented with hypoalbuminemia.

On transfer to the Oncology Medicine service the patient was
on 4 liters of oxygen nasal cannula, had sats in the high 90s
but desaturated frequently overnight, requiring BIPAP, which
she often refused.  Her most recent ejection fraction was
documented as 55% improved from the 25% noted three weeks
ago, requiring a CCU stay.  She could not ambulate secondary
to weakness, and she spoke softly, if at all, due to vocal
cord dysfunction status post extubation.  She tolerated only
honey nectar diet and was on aspiration precautions.  She was
also being treated for a urinary tract infection.

VITALS ON ADMISSION TO THE ONCOLOGY MEDICINE SERVICE:
Temperature 96.6, blood pressure 119/58, pulse of 114,
respirations 28, and a 97% saturation on 4 liters of nasal
cannula.  She is obese, pale, and has atrophic arms and legs.
She is sitting up, awake, and alert, writing down on paper
that she is frustrated being a mute.  Pupils are equal and
reactive to light.  Her conjunctivae are anicteric.  She has
no appreciable jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular
exam:  She has a regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2
and a positive S3 with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Radial
and dorsalis pedis pulses are 1+ bilaterally.  Respiratory:
She has poor effort and better air movement on the left
versus the right without crackles or wheezes.  Abdomen is
obese, soft, mildly distended without tympany or tenderness.
Extremities are pale, dry, and have edema to the knees 2+.

IMPRESSION:
1.  The impression was that she was an unfortunate
58-year-old woman with right renal cell carcinoma and
metastases to her lung and newly diagnosed metastases to her
brain status post nephrectomy for 29 days, severely
malnourished, and deconditioned.

2.  Her oncologic issues were renal cell carcinoma in which
treatment options were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Neurosurgery
was considering stereotactic surgery for the metastases, and
Radiation Oncology was following the patient through the CCU
stay into the OMED stay.

3.  Her CHF was compensated, but she has hypervolemic, but
diuresis was continued with Lasix and well maintained.
Respiratory status:  She had clear lungs and a known history
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, and the
hypoxia was thought to be multifactorial.  She had large
metastases as well as CHF.  She was maintained on BIPAP every
evening and nasal cannula throughout the day.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was hypothyroid, and
Levothyroxine was continued.  For renal her creatinine was
1.8;  at baseline, was 0.8 on admission.  She had one kidney
and was expected to have compensation by that point.  It was
felt that she was intervascularly dry, and she was given
fluids occasionally in order to mobilize the edema that was
present and perfuse her kidneys better.

5.  Per Infectious Diseases she had a urinary tract
infection.  She was on Ciprofloxacin.

6.  For Hematology she had anemia present since [**94**]/[**2195**].  Her
hematocrit was stable.  She was maintained on iron every day
and was given only prophylactic doses of Heparin subq given
her risk of bleeding at her nephrectomy site.

7.  For gastrointestinal she had no acute concerns, but she
was covered with a bowel and nausea regimen and Protonix
prophylaxis.  She was given tube feeds to improve her
nutrition and was tolerating these well.

8.  For deconditioning Physical Therapy and Occupational
Therapy were consulted to improve her status and set up home
services for when she was ready for discharge.  All these
plans were discussed with the family as well as with Dr.[**Name (NI) 47540**]
team.

As her diuresis was maintained and she was preparing for
discharge, the patient was continuing to receive tube feeds,
and on the evening of [**2196-8-20**] she was found, by the nurse,
unresponsive in her room.  A code was called.  Patient was
found to have vomited on her tube feeds.  She was
resuscitated and intubated and taken to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  She was
maintained on pressors and mechanical ventilation until her
family arrived, at which time a plan of care was discussed
with them and the medical time.  The family felt that it was
best to extubate her and to provide comfort measures.  The
patient was pronounced dead at 9:26 a.m. on [**2196-9-10**] with
her family at her side.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and primary team were made
aware.
