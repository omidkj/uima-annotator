HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85 year old male,
status post motor vehicle accident.  He was the restrained
driver of a motor vehicle that crashed into a guard rail.
The etiology the guard rail is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] may have
fallen asleep at the wheel verus having a syncopal episode.
Patient states that he blacked out while driving and that the
next thing that he remembers is bring pulled out of the
driver by EMS.  Wife was with him at the time and states that
he hit the guard rail while driving.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for hypertension,
coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass
graft and "kidney problems."  [**Name2 (NI) **] has multiple allergies
to penicillin, Biaxin, Ceclor and Tequin and takes
medications Procrit, Colace, iron, lactulose, terazosin,
Lopressor, Diltiazem, Zocor, Plavix and calcium and Lasix and
atorvastatin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission temperature 99.6 degrees
Fahrenheit, heart rate 67, blood pressure 188/54, respiratory
rate 20 and breathing at 98 percent on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  Was alert and oriented times three in no apparent
distress.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm and he was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended.  He had no
edema in his extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  At this time the patient was admitted to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for further
management and evaluation.  Patient was assesses at length in
the trauma bay and was admitted to the surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  Laboratories were drawn.  Toxicology screen was
negative.  Electrolytes were within normal limits.  His
hematocrit at this time was 37.4.  Electrocardiogram revealed
some first degree AV block with normal sinus rhythm with
occasional ectopy but no ischemic changes.  Chest x-ray
revealed no pneumothorax or fractures.  Pelvis x-ray revealed
no fractures.  CT scan of the cervical spine revealed no
fractures or malalignment with some degenerative joint
disease.  CT scan of the head revealed blood in his right
frontal sulcus, left sylvian fissure and left quadrigeminal
plate cistern consistent with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Convex collection of blood was found in the right frontal
region likely representing epidural hemorrhage.  There was
small intraventricular blood.  There were no fractures.

The patient was started on Dilantin at this time per
neurosurgery's request.  He was given morphine as needed for
pain control.  Goal blood pressure systolically was less than
140.  Patient had an arterial line placed at this time.
Nicardipine was started as well for blood pressure lowering
purposes.  The patient received a full syncopal work up and
ruled out for myocardial infarction via enzymes.  The patient
received an echocardiogram that revealed trace aortic
stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation.  Patient was
receiving intravenous fluids at this time.  A Foley catheter
was placed.  The patient was wearing pneumboots for
prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis.  The patient was
receiving Pepcid for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  The
patient receiving a regular insulin sliding scale.  On
hospital day number two the patient was noted to be stable
and received a CT scan of this head that revealed no changes
in the size or severity of his bleeds.

On hospital day number three the patient was restarted on all
of his home medications and had an MRA of his head and neck
which was also negative.  On hospital day number three the
patient was transferred to the floor from the Intensive Care
Unit without complaints.  At this point neurosurgery had
signed off and suggested that he receive a repeat head CT
scan in two weeks and a follow up appointment in clinic.  On
hospital day five the patient started to have somewhat
declining mental status and on urinalysis appeared to have
likely urinary tract infection.  He was started on Bactrim at
this time.  The case was also discussed with his primary care
physician and the results of his syncopal work up were
relayed and later in the day on [**2147-12-4**], hospital
day five patient had somewhat decreased oxygen saturations in
to the mid to high 80s requiring larger amounts of oxygen by
cannula.  The patient was ruled out again for myocardial
infarction by enzymes.  An arterial blood gas was drawn that
was within normal limits.  Lasix 10 mg was given intravenous.
An electrocardiogram was performed that revealed no
significant changes and a CT scan of the head was performed
which revealed no new changes or no new increase in size of
bleed.  Patient was also seen by physical therapy and
occupational therapy at this time.  They suggested that this
patient would likely benefit from an intensive rehabilitation
stay and on hospital day number six the patient had been
switched to aztreonam as the patient had spiked a fever to
101.4 and didn't appear to be improving from his likely
urinary tract infection with white counts of 20,000.  The
patient was to receive aztreonam fro one week and on hospital
day number seven patient was improving.  His mental status
appeared to be clearing.  The patient had been off one to one
sitters for greater than 24 hours at this time.  The patient
was taking a regular diet, cardiac heart healthy.  His sodium
was repleted with a recent level of 127.  He was receiving
salt tablets at this time and there were no other active
issues.  Thus the patient was able to be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

   hemorrhages.
2. Hypertension.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Congestive heart failure.
5. Renal insufficiency.

RECOMMENDED FOLLOW UP:  The patient to follow up in
neurosurgery in two weeks to re-evaluate these hemorrhages
with follow up CT scan of his head, to call to schedule an
appointment, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 52776**].
