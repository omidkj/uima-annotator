Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath [**2131-7-26**]: 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed a LMCA with a 70-80% ostial stenosis.
The LAD had an 80% distal stenosis. The LCX had mild diffuse
disease. The RCA was found to be 100% occluded proximally. 2.
Resting hemodynamics revealed low-normal systemic arterial
pressure with an SBP of 110/68. 3. Left ventriculography was
deferred. 4. Successful thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty of
the mid/distal RCA and PL.
Carotid ultrasound [**2131-7-27**]: IMPRESSION: There is a less than 40%
right ICA stenosis and a less than 40% left ICA stenosis with
antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries..
Echo [**8-1**]: Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
left atrial appendage. The remaining left ventricular segments
contract normally. EF=40-45%. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending [**Month/Year (2) 5236**] is moderately
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the ascending [**Month/Year (2) 5236**]. There
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic [**Month/Year (2) 5236**]. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion. Epi-aortic scan: Grade 1 plaque
posteriorly, minimal disease anteriorly. Helped decide best
cannula and X- clamp placement. Post-CPB: NSR, on phenylephrine.
EF now 45-50%, with improved inferior wall motion. RV systolic
fxn preserved. No AI. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5235**].
CXR [**8-13**]: In comparison with the study of [**8-12**], there is
indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm with some suggested
increased opacification in the left retrocardiac region,
consistent with atelectatic change or pneumonia. Otherwise, no
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt underwent cardiac catheterization and was found 3-vessel
disease, 70-80% left main stenosis and diffuse disease distally
with successful thrombectomy & angioplasty of the RCA vessel.
Transfered from cath to the CCU. Due to his hx of subarachnoid
hemorrhage, integrillin was stopped following angioplasty.
Heparin was continued, after discussion with neuro who indicated
that no contraindication for heparin as pt's CVA > 1yr ago. He
was started on beta blockade and ACE inhibitor, atorvastatin,
and a daily aspirin. Given his left main coronary disease, he is
to be taken to the operating room for CABG. He was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service.
He was taken to the operating room on [**8-1**] where he underwent
CABG x5 (LIMA->LAD, SVG->DLAD, SVG->OM, SVG->PDA-PL). Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU in critical but stable condition for
invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically [**Month/Year (2) 5235**] and extubated. On post-op
day one he was started on diuretics and beta blockers. He was
gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Also on post-op day
one he was transferred to the SDU for further management. Chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed pre protocol. He
had several episodes of atrial fibrillation which were
appropriately treated and amiodarone was eventually started. He
remained in sinus rhythm for several days prior to discharge.
Beta blockers were titrated for maximum hemodynamics.
Electrolytes were also repleted. He worked with physical therapy
for strength and mobility. Antibiotic was started for small
amount of sternal drainage. On post-op day nine a left chest
tube was re-inserted for small pneumothorax and effusion. Chest
tube was eventually removed on post-op day eleven. He appeared
to be doing well the following day and was discharged home with
the appropriate meds and follow-up appointments.
