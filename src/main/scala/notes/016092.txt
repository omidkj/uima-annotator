MICRO:
Urine Cultures: No Growth To Date

STUDIES:

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2122-11-5**]: No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in either leg.

ECHO: Severe pulmonary hypertension (~[**1-27**] systemic). Dilated
right ventricle with mild systolic dysfunction and pressure
overload. Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. No intracardiac shunting seen.

CXR: There is a right upper lobe relatively peripheral opacity
that might represent a pulmonary infarct giving the history of
pulmonary embolism although infectious process cannot be
excluded and comparison with outside chest CT is recommended.
The rest of the lungs are unremarkable except for left upper
paramediastinal opacity most likely representing atelectasis.
There is no pleural effusion and there is no pneumothorax. The
heart size is top normal although might be exaggerated by the
study technique and the low lung volumes.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia @ 110. Diffuse non-diagnostic
repolarization abnormalities. No previous tracing available for
comparison.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: Patient initially evaluated at
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital where she was found to have positive D-dimer;
CT scan done showed bilateral PEs. Patient recieved Lovenox at
approximately 5pm on [**2122-11-4**]. Lysis was deferred because she
was hemodynamically stable and there was no evidence of either
significant clot on LE ultrasound or PFO or significant right
heart strain on TTE.  Patient was put on a IV heparin drip in
the unit rather than Lovenox due to her body habitus. Warfarin
was started with a goal INR of [**1-27**]. She was kept on a heparin
drip until her INR was therapeutic. She was discharged on 5mg
Warfarin daily with instructions to have her INR checked on
Friday, [**11-13**] (2 days after discharge) and to have her
primary care physician follow up on her anticoagulation. The
cause of her pulmonary emboli were not clear, but her risk
factors included family history of blood clots (cousin), recent
oral contraceptive use, and smoking. While lower extremity U/S
during this admission showed no evidence of DVTs, per report
there was some evidence of a small DVT on previous LE U/S at an
OSH a few months prior to the current admission. Further work up
of potential coagulopathies was differed to after discharge
given her current clot burden.

2. Respiratory Failure: Patient was initially admitted to the
MICU on a non-rebreather with respiratory failure due to her
pulmonary emboli. PNA was considered to be unlikely given her
lack of fevers, lack of crackles on exam, and lack of clear
evidence of PNA on imaging. Asthma was also considered unlikely
given her lack of wheezing. She was given nebulizer treatments
to help with subjective shortness of breath and cough. She was
then successfully weaned to room air and remained stable,
without labored breathing or other signs of respiratory
distress, and saturating > 95% on room air for the remainder of
her hospitalization.

3. Hypothyroidism: Patient was admitted with PMH of
hypothyroidism but with current and recent non-compliance on
levothyroxine and uncertainty about her current dose. Her
primary care physician was [**Name (NI) 653**] and she was started on her
previous dose of 50mcg daily. A TSH was checked and was normal
but was considered unlikely to be accurate given her current
medical state. This issue should be followed up as an
outpatient.

4. GERD: Patient was continued on Omeprazole.

5. FOLLOW-UP: Patient should have her INR followed regularly and
her Coumadin adjusted accordingly.

levothyroxine - not taking
PPI - not taking
OCP - was taking until 1 month prior to admission when ran out
Albuterol inhaler (has not needed since [**2117**] until recent
