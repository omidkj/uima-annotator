CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever of unknown origin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 61-year-old male
with a history of atrial fibrillation, obstructive-sleep
apnea, and right MCA stroke with result in hemiparesis, who
has been in a nursing home environment since a stroke in
[**2176-9-10**].  While at the nursing home, the patient had
multiple Clostridium difficile infections and urinary tract
infection treated with Bactrim and Augmentin.

On [**2177-2-24**], the patient presented to the Emergency Room
with fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and urgency.  At
[**Hospital 46516**] Hospital, urine culture at that time was positive
for E. coli.  The patient had mental status changes with
fevers as 105.  Patient was hypotensive requiring Levophed.
The patient was intubated for airway protection at the
outside hospital and taken to their Intensive Care Unit,
where he was treated with Zosyn, Vancomycin, and Flagyl with
a diagnosis of septic shock, Clostridium difficile, and blood
cultures subsequently grew out Staph coag negative organisms
on [**2177-2-26**] which were thought to come from an indwelling
PICC line.

At the outside hospital, this PICC line was subsequently
removed, and revealed Staphylococcus aureus.  Chest x-ray
revealed bibasilar infiltrates and sputum revealed
Staphylococcus aureus [**3-4**] and there was some concern for
aspiration given the patient's poor mental status.  The
patient was made NPO at that time.  A random cortisol level
was drawn at that time and was 18.  Patient was given
hydrocortisone for borderline hypoadrenalism with improved
blood pressures.  The patient had persistent febrile episodes
while on antibiotics and workup for tumor fever ensued.

Abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed bilateral pneumonia, no
abscess, 3.5 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm, 1-1.5 cm
paratracheal lymph nodes, mild asymmetry of the breast tissue
on the right, splenomegaly with small posteroinferior
infarct.  Endocarditis was entertained.  Echocardiogram
revealed an ejection fraction of 55%, no wall motion
abnormalities, no vegetations, but was a limited study.

Hematology/Oncology was consulted.  At that time tumor
markers were done.  CEA was normal.  CA-125 was noted to be
moderately elevated.  Alpha fetoprotein and CA-99 were
negative.  A trial of Clinoril was performed with no
improvement of the patient's fevers.  CH-50, C3, and C4 were
also done and were within normal limits.  A Rheum consult was
asked.  Rheumatologist noted increased LDH of 1,522, ferritin
of greater than 1,300.  Rheumatoid factor and [**Doctor First Name **] were
negative.

Patient was subsequently extubated, though his pulmonary
status remained tenuous.  Patient remained afebrile on
numerous antibiotics for 24 hours prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 1444**].  Patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for workup of his fever
of unknown origin and treatment of his pneumonia, Clostridium
difficile colitis, and urinary tract infection.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit service and a workup for fever of unknown origin ensued.
Patient was continued on his aggressive treatment of a
Clostridium difficile colitis as well as his urinary tract
infection and his aspiration pneumonia with the current
antibiotics.  Infectious Disease consultants followed the
patient closely throughout his course.

The cause of his persistently high fevers were thought to be
most likely infectious, but given the patient's extremely
high LDH levels and some lymphadenopathy noted on CT scan at
the outside hospital, the possibility of malignancy was also
considered and Hematology/Oncology consult was also
requested.  Patient subsequently had a whole body CT scan.

CTA of the chest was a limited study due to the patient's
habitus, but revealed numerous mediastinal and hilar lymph
nodes, multiple paratracheal lymph nodes, the largest of
which was 1 cm in diameter.  There was also a 1.4 x 1 cm left
hilar lymph node as well as a 1.2 x 1 cm right hilar lymph
node as well.  There were two large carinal lymph nodes
present as well, and there were numerous nonpathologically
enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes as well.  There were
areas of atelectasis within the left lower lobe, and there
was no evidence of pulmonary embolus on examination.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a splenic infarct,
which was known from outside hospital.  No intraabdominal or
intrapelvic abscesses were identified and small bilateral
pleural effusions were noted.

The interpretation of these findings was difficult given the
fact that patient had numerous infectious etiologies and
possible malignancy.  Patient's numerous enlarged lymph nodes
were thought to be consistent with a reactive process.  But
given the possibility of malignancy, it was thought that
tissue biopsy would be appropriate.  Unfortunately, the lymph
nodes were not amenable to percutaneous biopsy, and
mediastinoscopy was thought necessary.

The patient's wife deferred mediastinoscopy given the
patient's poor prognosis and worsening condition.
Cardiothoracic Surgery consultants were requested at this
time, evaluated the patient, but held off on any further
workup given the family's hesitation for invasive procedures.

Patient also had an abdominal ultrasound performed to check
for any lymphangitic involvement of the liver given the
patient's mildly elevated LFTs.  Ultrasound revealed an
enlarged liver, but no focal masses were seen.  There was no
evidence of intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  No
pericholecystic fluid was seen, and it was thought to be a
relatively benign study.

Patient also had a CT scan of the head performed given the
patient's mental status change and given the patient's
history of prostate cancer, and right MCA stroke, it was
desired to determine that there was no intracranial process
that was contributing to his condition.  CT scan revealed
only evidence of chronic infarctions involving the right
anterior division of the MCA with a small posterior left
frontal infarction which were all thought to be old.  The
