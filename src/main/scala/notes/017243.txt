Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2158-6-22**] for h/o sigmoid
diverticulitis with new onset [**Date Range **], chills, n/v.  She was found
to have a pelvic abscess.  During the workup, the patient was
noted to have elevated cardiac enzymes and cardiology was
consulted.  She was deemed to be unstable for surgery and her
abscess was drained on [**6-23**] and she was treated with
antibiotics.  Cardiology recommended to postpone surgery [**3-30**]
weeks to treat her NSTEMI.  She was started on plavix.  She was
kept as inpatient until her surgery date.  On [**7-3**] she was taken
for a cardiac cath, but it was aborted due to inability to reach
distal occlusion.  She was started on TPN on [**7-9**] and remained
on it until [**7-31**].  On [**7-10**] she had an abd/pelvis CT that showed
drainage catheter curled within 5cm improving complex pelvic
abscess.  On [**7-18**] the plavix was held for surgery per cardiology
recs.  On [**7-24**] the patient underwent an ex lap, sigmoid
resection, colostomy and [**Doctor Last Name 3379**].  She had an uncomplicated
perioperative course and was transfered to the SICU postop for
closer monitoring.  After surgery her TPN was resumed and she
remained on TPN until POD 6.  She stayed in the SICU on POD [**12-26**],
during which time she had a period of low urine output, for
which she was restarted on lasix since she has a history of
being lasix dependant.  Her pain was controlled with an
epidural, then transitioned to a PCA, then to PO dilaudid as per
acute pain service recs.  On POD6 she complained of back pain as
she was standing up to get out of bed.  An MRI showed possible
compression fracture at T11 and degenerative and disc changes.
Acute pain service and ortho spine were consulted and she was
started on conservative pain management per pain service and
both services will see her as an outpatient.  PT evaluated the
patient on POD7 and determined that she is able to walk but will
need physical therapy upon discharge.
