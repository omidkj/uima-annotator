chest pain

left heart catheterization,coronary angiogram


History of Present Illness:
This 69 year old white male with a history of coronary stents x2
was admitted with substernal chest pain for 3 days.  He
described it as sharp with acute onset epigastric pain after
dinner 3 days ago, worse on lying in bed, improved with sitting
up and patient has thus been sleeping in a recliner. The pain
resolved after 30 minutes and improved with TUMS. He has had 2
subsequent episodes of chest pain not clearly associated with
eating, but denies any shortness of breath, or association with
exercise.no nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis. Shortly after arrival
to the ED his pain resolved and he has been angina free since.

On ROS he complains of dyspnea [**1-6**] deconditioning following fall
between truck and dock 2 years ago with fracturing of L leg. He
is able to walk [**12-8**] mile or two flights of stairs before
experiencing shortness of breath. He denies any orthopnea, pnd,
syncope, or palpitations. He also reports left greater than
right lower extremity edema since his leg fracture and surgery.
The edema is worse in the evening and greatly improved in the
am. He denies any claudication symptoms but has night time leg
cramps.
.
On general review of systems, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors.he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain.
.
In the ED: The patient was chest pain free. EKG revealed ST
depression II, V-6, ST elevation V-1, T wave inversion V2 V3,
V4. The patient was discussed with the cardiology fellow who
advised admission to [**Hospital1 **], observation of symptoms and no
treatment (no plavix or heparin) initially. However, CE then
returned with Trop 2.0, CK 1300; heparin gtt started. He was
started on ASA, metoprolol and high dose statin. He was noted to
be in [**Last Name (un) **], received prehydration with mucomyst, bicarb for
anticipated cath in future. On arrival to the floor he was also
started on integrillin, reopro had been preferred given his
[**Last Name (un) **],however there were logistical limitations to administering
reopro [**1-6**] nursing/pharmacy comfort, and integrillin was started
instead.In addition, plavix was not given as patient had known
hx of 3 vessel disease, and it was unclear whether he would go
to cath versus being triaged straight to CABG.

noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus
hyperlipidemia

Social History:

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2121-12-2**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.


RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Calcified tips of papillary muscles.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion echo dense,
c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. Effusion is
loculated.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
entire ventricle with the exception of the basal inferior,
inferolateral and anterolateral walls.. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is a small pericardial
effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood,
