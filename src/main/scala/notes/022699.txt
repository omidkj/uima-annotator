         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.  PENICILLIN SENSITIVITY AVAILABLE ON
REQUEST.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 y/o M with HTN, DM2 who was admitted to OSH with fever
and LBP and found to have a discitis and epidural abscess at T9;
transferred here for further care.
.
1) Epidural Abscess/Discitis/Vertebral Osteomyelitis:
Unclear source at present time, although is having persistent
bacteremia that suggests an endocarditis. No evidence of
peripheral splinters or lesions to suggest embolic phenomenon.
Has +blood cxs as major criteria, and fever as minority Duke
criteria. His embolic complications include the
abscess/discitis/osteomyelitis as above. Unfortunately has PCN
allergy as above that prevented first line therapy with
Nafcillin or Ancef.  He was restarted on Vancomycin IV 1g [**Hospital1 **]
for coverage of his MSSA given his ? PCN allergy.  He had a
repeat Thoracic MRI that again demonstrated the T9-T10 epidural
abscess.  He was seen by the ortho spine service who took him to
the OR on [**2115-4-17**] who performed a laminectomy and epidural
abscess drainage.  Fluid was sent to the lab for cx and a JP
drain was left in place until POD#5.
Pt was taken to ICU for PCN desensitization w/o complication.
Per ID the pt will require at the very least a 6 week course of
naficillin and will be re-imaged at that time w/ neck MRI and
Chest CT to determine if and how long additional nafcillin will
be required. a Picc line was placed under fluro on [**2115-4-24**].

2) Empyema
On admission, he was found to have greatly diminished breath
sounds and a CXR demonstrated a loculated anterior pleural
effusion.  The IP service was consulted who performed a
thoracentesis which demonstrated an empyema with GPC growing
from the fluid.  The thoracics service was consulted who placed
a chest tube in place for drainage of the collection.  He was
taken to the OR on [**4-19**] for a VATS/decortication.  Fluid and pus
were removed from the pleural space and again sent to the lab
for culture.  2 chest tubes were left in place.  Post-op he
developed worsening stridor and SOB and he was re-intubated in
the PACU.  He was transferred to the SICU x 3days anfd thought
to have lost hypoxic drive secondary to incrased O2 and
worsening COPD/resp acidosis. He was bronch'd on ICU day 3 and
found to have tracheobronchitis w/ copious secretions. His resp
and metabolic disturbances were corrected and he had aggressive
pul tiolet and was extubated successfully on ICU day #4.

2) DM2
His Januvia was continued for coverage of his FS.  He was
initially started on short-acting Insulin, but given his high
insulin requirement, long acting Lantus was started and titrated
up for goal FS < 200.


3) Psych
Continued his home dose of Abilify 40mg and Lexapro 30mg.

4) Hyperlipidemia
Continued statin and Tricor

5) Asthma
Continued Albuterol/Atrovent nebs, Flovent [**Hospital1 **]
