Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 15685**] was admitted to the CSRU and started on heparin and

condition. He was extubated later that same day. He remained on
neo through POD #3. He was transfused 2 units PRBCs. He was
transferred to the floor on POD #3. He did well postoperatively.
His BUN and creatinine rose slightly and his lasix was

void. Flomax was started. His foley catheter was removed after
24 hours and he was able to void. Mr. [**Known lastname 15685**] developed atrial
