History of Present Illness:
40 year old female with long standing history of
psycho-affective disorder, who has been on lithium and multiple
other antipsychotic medications transferred from [**Hospital1 1474**] for
management of continued respiratory failure.  She initially
presented to [**Hospital1 1474**] with fever, cough, and worsening dyspnea
on exertion for 3 days.  She had a CXR there which was
consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia and was started on IV
antibiotics, Ceftriaxone and Zithromax.  She also had an
elevated BUN and creatinine.  She was intubated within 24 hours
of admission for an ABG of 7.40/38/77.  Bronchoscopy performed
but reportedly was unrevealing, and blood cultures were
negative.  Antibiotics were broadened and on transfer here she
was on pip/tazo, azithro, vanco and fluconazole.

Brief Hospital Course:
40 yr old female with hx of schizoaffective disorder transferred
from [**Hospital 1474**] hospital with LLL pneumonia and resp failure
requiring intubation.
.
1. Respiratory Failure: The etiology remains unclear. The
patient exhibited some dystonia secondary to her antipsychotic
medication use. The possibility was raised that the initial
insult was antipsychotic induced dysphagia, with subsequent
massive aspiration and pneumonia. However this cannot be
confirmed as the patient was not alert on admission and her
capacity to swallow at that time is unknown. At OSH, pt was
diagnosed with pneumonia and then intubated due to respiratory
failure.  An echo at the OSH showed an EF of 70%. CXR showed a
layering left sided pleural effusion that was tapped out of
concern for empyema; nothing grew on culture, although it was
exudative. As pt's mental status improved, the vent was weaned.
On HD #8, pt was ready for extubation but due to severe airway
edema, extubation was deferred and she was given steroids. The
following day, anesthesia extubated the pt over a cook catheter
and she remained extubated, breathing well on a nasal cannula.
For her pneumonia, pt was intially on ceftriaxone and azithro at
[**Hospital1 1474**] then broadened with pip/tazo and vanco after
intubation. Azithro and ceftriaxone were d/c'ed shortly after
arriving at [**Hospital1 18**]. Vanco and Zosyn were d/c'd [**7-17**] once pt had
completed a 14-day course. Since being extubated, pt was weaned
off oxygen and oxygenated well on room air.  She was continued
on albuterol and atrovent nebs for reactive airway disease. Due
to her ineffective cough reflex, she is advised to continue
incentive spirometry and nebs on discharge.
.
2. Dysphagia: the patient has failed three swallow tests,
including video swallow. The last test was on [**7-26**] and showed
aspiration of solid and fluids and ineffective cough reflex. The
patient had an NGT inserted and, after failing the last test,
she was offered the choice of a smaller NGT or a PEG. A PEG was
inserted [**7-27**] by GI. She should remain on prophylactic Unasyn
through [**2153-7-31**], as well as continue to receive local wound
care.
.
3. Fever:  Pt had fevers up to 103 during her first several days
in the ICU. She was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics
(azithro, vancomycin and zosyn) for a total of 14 days. The
differential diagnosis of her fever included meningitis,
epidural abscess, resolving pulmonary infection and antibiotics.
An LP done at [**Hospital1 1474**] was unremarkable. An MRI of the spine was
negative for spinal or epidural abscess. The pt defervesced
after her antibiotics were discontinued; her fever was
ultimately attributed to drug fevers. Blood cx, urine cx and cx
from the pleural fluid were negative.
.
4. Mental Status Changes:  On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, pt was
unresponsive on propofol.  After the propofol was weaned off, pt
continued to be unresponsive.  A head CT was negative. There was
concern for central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) given that her Na
in [**Hospital1 1474**] was 123 and rapidly corrected to 145 within one day
there. An MRI was negative for intracranial processes and
changes associated with CPM.  Neurology was consulted and an EEG
revealed non-specific bursts of generalized slowing. As sedating
medications were discontinued, pt began to slowly become more
responsive and was able to be weaned off the vent.  Psych
followed the patient and recommended slowly starting back her
outpatient meds, depakote and haldol.  Given her persistent
swallowing difficulties and concern for tardive dyskinsesias
caused by haloperidol, this medication was stopped [**7-23**] (see
below). Psychiatry recommended starting Zyprexa 10 mg qd [**7-28**],
so the patient is discharged on this medication.
.
5. Schizoaffective Disorder:  As above, pt was followed by psych
and after her mental status improved, she was restarted on her
home psych meds, depakote and haldol.  As noted above,
haloperidol was stopped out of concern for tardive dyskinesias
and was replaced with olanzapine.  She should be followed
closely by a psychiatrist while at [**Hospital1 700**]
and then return to the care of her outpatient psychiatrist
thereafter.
.
6. Hypernatremia: Reportedly, the pt was admitted to the OSH
with a Na of 123 which was rapidly corrected to 145 within one
day.  As above, there was initial concern for central pontine
myelinolysis but MRI was negative.  Pt then had problems with
hypernatremia.  This was corrected with free water via NGT and
D5W. The hospital course has been characterized by a tendency to
normal sodium or hypernatremia, with Na values between 146-155.
Due to her inability to swallow and drink water, it is not clear
whether
