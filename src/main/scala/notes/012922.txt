Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
bleeding, hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Laryngoscopy and biopsy of right tonsil.
2. Right Neck Biopsy
3. Rigid esophagoscopy.
4. Flexible bronchoscopy through the endotracheal
tube.
5. EGD (2)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of
HIV (viral load in [**2126-4-5**] was undetectable) and COPD on 3.5
liters of oxygen at home who presents from the PACU. She was
noted to have a right neck mass, presumably squamous cell
carcinoma based on earlier biopsies, with unknown primary site,
and had presented today for surgical biospy of right tonsil.
According to the ENT team, today in the OR the patient underwent
a biopsy of an enlarged right tonsil, which was inconclusive
based on frozen path sections. A right neck mass excisional
biospy was then completed, which was also inconclusive on
pathology sections. After the procedure, she was extubated, and
reported to vomit approximately 200cc of blood. At that point,
she was re-intubated by anesthesia and her oropharynx was
re-examined. There was some bleeding of her right tonsil which
was treated with electrocautery and stitches. She was noted to
have some blood in her nose, felt to be from her tonsils. Per
ENT team, an organzied clot was then noted in her ETT.

At that point, the interventional pulmonary team was contact[**Name (NI) **],
and patient underwent bronchoscopy. She was noted to have clot
in her distal airways that was cleaned out, without any evidence
of active bleeding.

After bronchoscopy, her sedation was lightened, and again she
was noted have an episode of hematemesis. GI was consulted and
patient underwent EGD. She was noted to have a large amount of
clot in the antrum of her stomach without visible bleeding or
ulcer. It was recommended that she remain intubated and be
transferred to the ICU for further monitoring, with IR
intervention in event of re-bleed, and plan for repeat EGD in 1
day.

The ENT team also noted that she was transiently hypotensive to
a systolic of 70 during the surgery, possibly due to being given
labetolol. She was briefly on pressors however those were
weaned. She received 2.5 liters of intravenous fluid in the OR,
and a type and cross was sent.

She was stabilized in the ICU, successfully extubated and then
transferred to the floor.

Review of sytems: The patient denies hematemesis prior to
present episode.  Also denies hemoptysis, reflux, dysphagia,
hoarseness of voice, abdominal pain, fevers/chills, night
sweats, lymphadenopathy, hematochezia, melena, diarrhea, change
in bowel habits, cp, increased sob above baseline.

Past Medical History:
- HIV, last viral load undectable [**2126-4-5**]
- Neck mass, biopsy at [**Hospital3 **] [**2126-5-6**], consistent with
squamous cell carcinoma
- COPD on 3.5 liters oxygen at baseline
- Psoriasis
- Status-post tubal ligation
- Status-post lung biopsy, further details unknown
- Question of sleep apnea (noted in anesthesia chart)


Social History:
She lives with her brother and one of her daughters.  She used
to be a long-term smoker for about 30 years, she quit five years
since the diagnosis of COPD.  She does not alcohol abuse.  She
used to work as a house painter, but not
being able to work because of her respiratory compromise.  She
contracted HIV from her second husband who died from
complications of HIV and lung cancer.  She denies use of herbal
supplements, recreational drugs.


Family History:
Her father died at a young age of 30 of coronary artery disease.
 Her mother lives alone.  Her mother had uterine cancer in her
50s.  There is no other history of cancer.

Imaging:
[**2126-8-15**] CXR: Bibasilar atelectasis, cannot rule out infectious
process, would recommend followup if clinically warranted.

[**2126-8-15**] CXR: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with
patient in
supine position. Available for comparison is a preceding similar
study
obtained three hours earlier during the same date. The ETT
remains in
unchanged position. An NG tube has now been placed and is seen
to reach far below the diaphragm. No pneumothorax has developed,
and no new parenchymal infiltrates are seen. On previous
postoperative supine film identified atelectasis in the left
lower lobe area is clearing up and only a plate atelectasis
remains.

[**2126-8-16**]: CXR: Opacities at the right and left base have worsened
since a day prior, with increase in size of a small left pleural
effusion. The upper lungs are clear and there is no
pneumothorax. An endogastric tube courses below the diaphragm,
tip off the film. The endotracheal tube is unchanged in
position.  IMPRESSION: Worsening bibasilar opacities may reflect
aspiration.

[**2126-8-16**]: CXR: The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Compared to the prior
study, there is improvement of basilar aeration with no new
abnormalities such as consolidation to suggest infectious
process/aspiration.

[**2126-8-17**]: CXR: The current study again demonstrates development
of volume overload and bibasal opacities that appears to be very
similar to [**2126-8-16**] study obtained at 06:16 a.m. thus
suggesting fluctuations in the lung appearance; it might be
consistent with pulmonary edema. The ET tube tip is 6 cm above
the carina.

[**2126-8-16**]: EGD: Blood clot at Fundus. Clot not movable. No active
bleeding.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

[**2126-8-21**]: EGD: In the posterior pharynx there was oozing noted
and an area of irregular ulcerated mucosa. Normal mucosa in the
esophagus. Normal mucosa in the duodenum. Normal mucosa in the
stomach. Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
