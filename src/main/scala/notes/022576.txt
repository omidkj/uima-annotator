Chief Complaint:
Shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with COPD (home O2 requirement= 4LNC) requiring multiple
ICU admissions (three in the last 2 months) and intubations,
hypertension, coronary artery disease, GERD and diverticulosis
with hospitalization in [**2-14**] for presumed diverticular bleed p/w
hematochezia this morning. He was discharged most recently on
[**7-12**] after COPD flare was treated with short burst of steroids
before dropping down to his home dose of 20mg prednisone.  He
reports 1 episode of crampy abdominal pain with 2-3 episodes
BRBPR this morning around 4-6am precipitating presentation to
ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5, 90/50, 96, 16, 97% on RA. His
lowest BP [**Location (un) 1131**] was 84/50. He received 1L NS and had one
peripheral IV and a triple lumen CVL placed in the right IJ.
His Hct was elevated from baseline of 30-33 at 39. GI was called
in the ED; planned to admit to MICU for serial HCTs and
potentially a scope. Two units of blood were crossmatched.
Vitals prior to transfer were 98.7 80 95/47 24 100% 4L NC.
.
On arrival to the MICU pt denied any pain.  He stated his
breathing was at baseline. No chest pain. No lightheadedness
with ambulation. Abdominal pain resolved.  He did have 1 further
small episode of BRBPR in the ICU.  He reported eating West
Indian food yesterday which he notes will sometimes upset his
stomach. Eats multiple seeded fruits as well. Typically is
constipated, had diarrhea this am. He denies EtOH or NSAID use.
Otherwise ROS unremarkable. NGL performed at bedside with 200cc
instilled, bilious gastic contents removed, no blood or coffee
grounds.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68 yo male with extensive history of hospitalizations
for COPD exacerbation as well as multiple lower GI bleeds
admitted for hematochezia.
.
# Hematochezia: likely diverticular bleed given history of
signficant diverticula.  He has had 1 prior hospitalization for
a lower GI bleed in [**2-14**] for which only sources identified on
scope were diverticula. Other potential etiologies include
internal hemorrhoids.  Colonic mass is less likely given
multiple prior scopes in past 9 years. Upper GI bleed less
likely given absence of [**Date Range **] and clear nasogastric lavage.  Is
on chronic steroids so is at risk for gastritis. Given no prior
source definitively identified previously, small bowel sources
are also possible.  Was transfused 1 unit pm [**7-22**] for
persistantly low but stable Hct.
Had one episode of maroon stool early morning on [**7-22**]; since
then, he had one episode of "trickling" blood on [**7-23**]. No
bleeding after that. Throughout this hospital course, patient
had one 20G peripheral IV in place. IV PPI was started in the
MICU and patient transitioned to home PPI PO dose upon arrival
to floor. Stool cultures were done [**2-7**] crampy bowel movmements,
which came back negative.
.
-GI was consulted in the MICU, no intervention now due to
patient's known history of diverticulosis, confirmed on recent
colonoscopy ([**2107-3-2**]).  Due to recurrent episodes of
hematochezia, colectomy/partial colectomy was discussed in MICU
to reduce future bleeding risk. But given the extensive
distribution of his diverticulosis, a segmental resection may
not be curative and a total colectomy would carry increased
morbidity. Per GI recs, should patient have another bleed, a
bleeding scan should be done (despite relatively poor accuracy)
to better localize soruce of bleeding. This may aide
interventional treatment, guide resection localization. Home
aspirin was held due to the bleed. Patient was hemodynamically
stable in the MICU and transferred out to the floor, where he
remained hemodynamically stable until discharge. Hematocrit
q6hrs per GI in MICU --> q8hrs on CC7. Hematocrit stabilized on
[**2107-7-23**] (26.5 --> 28.7 --> 30.4 --> 27.8 --> 29.2)
.
# sustained VT: Pt had 16 seconds ventricular tachycardia with
mild chest "tightness" and SOB overnight [**7-21**]. When asked where,
pointed more towards his neck. Started on nebulizers and got
EKG, cardiac enzymes and electrolytes. SOB and "tightness"
quickly resolved. Felt not very likely to have an MI.  Cardiac
enzymes came back negative X2. Lytes were normal. Patient does
not have a history  of VT and last ECHO done in [**2103-8-6**]. No
more episodes of VT in MICU or on the floor. Patient was advised
to follow up on this with an ECHO or stress test as an
outpatient. His PCP is [**Name Initial (PRE) 12309**].
.
# COPD. Remained at baseline (4L O2) throughout this hospital
course. Pa
