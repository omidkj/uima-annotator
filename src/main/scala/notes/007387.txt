CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Epistaxis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old
woman with a history of hypertension, severe degenerative
joint disease who is recovering from a C1-C2 fracture at
rehabilitation.  The patient suffered a repeat fracture of
C1-C2 region in mid [**Month (only) 404**], question of acuity of fracture.
Her hospital course at [**Hospital1 2025**] was complicated by an
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, neck
edema, and poor swallow with subsequent malnutrition.  The
patient was recovering at rehabilitation with a Dobbhoff
nasogastric tube in place.  She was treated at that time with
anticoagulation medications, including aspirin, low-molecular
weight, heparin and Vioxx.  The patient was noted to have
decreased hematocrit two days prior to admission and received
two packed red blood cells with appropriate bump in
hematocrit, to her baseline, up 30 to 32.  On the day of
admission the patient had an nasogastric tube, attempted
replacement, [**Name6 (MD) **] the RN note there were several attempts were
unsuccessful to place nasogastric tube in the early
afternoon.  The patient was then noted to have bright red
blood per rectum in the afternoon, and in the evening
developed a brisk nosebleed.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] as [**Hospital1 2025**] was on divert for
further evaluation.  In the Emergency Room, the patient
received nasal packing by the Otorhinolaryngology Team.  She
was noted to be hypertensive with blood pressure greater than
200/100 and was started on Labetalol drip, given Fentanyl and
Morphine for pain as well as enteric coverage with Ancef.
she was transferred to Medicine Intensive Care Unit for
further evaluation.  Of note, the patient also was started on
Levofloxacin at the nursing home on the day of transfer for
Klebsiella urinary tract infection.

manipulation.  She may be able to tolerate time out of collar
while resting in bed at this point.  The patient also has
evidence of bilateral knee replacements as well as right
shoulder repair.  2.  Saccular aneurysm causing cranial nerve

History of alcoholism, no seizures, no tobacco, no illicits.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No bleeding disorders.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.7, heart
rate 82, blood pressure 168/77, respiratory rate 17, 97% on
room air.  General:  Frail, elderly woman, debilitated,
sitting up in bed, in a cervical collar, uncomfortable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 9.0, hematocrit 36.8, platelets
344, chemistry 132, potassium 5.7, chloride 93, bicarbonate
30, BUN 22, creatinine 0.6, glucose 98.  Cardiac enzymes,
creatinine kinase 53, 13.  Coagulation screen, Patient 12.2,
INR 1.0, PTT 27, fibrinogen 1000.  Chest x-ray, no acute
cardiopulmonary process.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Epistaxis - The patient was followed by
Otorhinolaryngology Service.  Her nasal packings were slowly
deflated over the course of four days and eventually removed.
Her hematocrit remained stable.  Given the patient's normal
coagulation screen, fibrinogen and age and intrinsic bleeding
disorder felt unlikely.  The brisk bleed is likely secondary
to anticoagulation with aspirin, Fragmin and Vioxx.  These
medications were discontinued.  The patient was transfused a
total of 3 units of packed red blood cells with appropriate
bump in her hematocrit.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient has a history of
Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection,
discontinued on Penicillin, Oxacillin through [**2118-3-2**],
to complete her course, as started at [**Hospital1 2025**] as well as for
empiric coverage while nasal packing is in place.  The
patient completed a three day course of Levofloxacin for
Klebsiella on admission.  On [**2118-3-2**], the patient was
noted to have an elevated white blood cell count from 11 to
15.  Chest x-ray demonstrated right lower lobe infiltrate,
question of aspiration.  She was started on a ten day course
of Levofloxacin and Flagyl.

3.  Pulmonary - The patient was maintained on high-flow
facemask with stable oxygenation.  She required frequent
suction.  She will need to continue to get out of bed and
needs incentive spirometry to prevent further atelectasis or
development of pneumonia.

4.  Gastrointestinal - The patient was evaluated by the
Gastroenterology Service for question of gastrointestinal
bleed with history of bright red blood per rectum episode.
The patient demonstrated no further episodes of rectal
bleeding.  Her stool was guaiac positive, although expected
given her epistaxis.  She should continue to follow with
gastrointestinal as an outpatient for further workup of her
gastrointestinal tract as warranted.

5.  Nutrition - The patient presented with very poor
nutritional status, albumin 2.9 on admission.  She underwent
placement of a gastrojejunostomy tube by Interventional
Radiology on [**2118-2-28**], tube sites were commenced on
[**2118-3-1**].  The patient should not have further
nasogastric tube placed given previous trauma.

6.  Hypertension - The patient was maintained on Labetalol
drip until gastrojejunostomy tube placed.  She was then
restarted on oral medications including Lisinopril 20 mg p.o.
q. day, Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Clonidine patch 0.2
transdermal q. week.  The patient's blood pressure was stable
130s to 140s systolic on these medications.

7.  Pain - The patient was continued on her Fentanyl patch as
well as small dose of Morphine Sulfate prn, will continue on
Tylenol prn once on the medical floor.

8.  Anxiety - The patient received Ativan prn.

9.  Prophylaxis - The patient wore Pneumo boots through the
duration of her stay.  No further low-molecular weight
heparin recommended given her bleed.  She was also maintained
on initially on intravenous proton pump inhibitors and
subsequently changed to Pantoprazole per gastrostomy tube.

10. Physical therapy - The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy at the time of discharge from the Intensive Care Unit
and was out of bed to chair.  She will continue to need
rehabilitation in the coming week.

11. Code - Full.  Proxy is patient's daughter and son.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to Medicine
Floor for continued management of he
