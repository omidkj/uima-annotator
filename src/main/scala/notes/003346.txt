Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
substernal chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72 y/o M with h/o CAD (known 3VD, declined bypass x5
yrs), CKD (cr 3.5), dCM (EF 25%, declined ICD previously), DM,
BRBPR (not yet worked up) p/w 1 week SOB, substernal chest
discomfort and left arm pain, also with bloody stools. Pt was
admitted to floor where he received 1u pRBC, O2, morphine, lasix
and NTG. Pt then went into acute respiratory distress and was
admitted to the ICU. Found to be hypotensive, tachycardic and
diaphoretic and agitated. given SL NTG then on IV NTG gtt.
received total of 6mg IV morphine and was calmer. For his
tachycardia he was given IV lopressor. CXR done at that time
showed RLL infiltrate that was worsening on followup CXR with
"intermittent infiltrate" (not always seen) in left lung. Pt
only put out 300ccs of urine to 280 IV lasix (40mg IV bolus
followed by gtt). Trop T 0.11 and went up to 0.67. FSG in the
600s, GAP unknown at presentation but down to 13 prior to
transfer (glucose in 200s by then). pt placed on insulin gtt
with resolution of blood sugars to 200s. Pt hyperkalemic with K
6.4 --> 7.2 --> 6.1, 1 dose kayexelate given. Pt was taken off
bipap and nitro gtt but developed acutely worsening SOB, BP down
to 70/40 and levophed was started. Pt started on azithro/unasyn
out of c/f PNA. Pt had fever last week but was afebrile at OSH.
EKG showed LBBB, wide QRS with elevated K. TTE yesterday showed
mildly dilated LV, LVEF 30% akinesis of anterior wall, apex,
septum, inf/inferolateral wall, moderate MR, mod TR, mild pHTN
PAP 40, small effusion. Pt also received steroids. Pt was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Vitals prior to
transfer were HR 91, BP 85.46 SpO2 99%.
.
On arrival pt was on levophed 20, insulin 6u/hr, protonix drips
and bipap. Vital signs were AF T97.4 HR 93 Bp105/50 (63) RR19
100% on nonrebreather (50%FIO2).
.
ECG showed NSR at 100bpm with no ST changes suggestive of
ischemia but with peaked T waves in antero-lateral leads. Labs
showed: trop 1.46 CKBM 49, Cr of 4.1 up from b/l 3.5, K of 6.1,
bicarb 19, sodium 134, glucose 285.  WBC 10, HCT 30.  Lactate
0.6.  Pt was placed on bipap at 40% for ABG of 7.11/60/318. Was
given lasix 200mg IV without much urine output, placed on lasix
gtt of 20 and metolazone 5mg given. After 30 minutes ABG showed
7.14/54/93.
.
Of note, family very conflicted about goals of care, pt has
refused multiple interventions in the past and recurrently
noncompliant with therapy. Conversations with family through the
language line were extensive. Daughter in law speaks English and
knows medical terminology and stated that the interpreter??????s
accent was difficult to understand. Pt refused to make decision
regarding dialysis, code status, and HCP. At first refused
anticoagulation and PR medications but bipap was removed to make
him more comfortable and have a conversation effectively and he
agreed to these measures.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
- ECHO:
[**2122**] at [**Hospital1 18**] TTE: EF 25%
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include akinesis of the lower third of the LV with inferolateral
akinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. No pericardial effusion seen.
.
TTE [**2128-2-11**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and
extensive apical akinesis with focal dyskinesis. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2122-5-8**], inferior wall contractile dysfunction is more
extensive, with consequent worsening of mitral regurgitaton.
