Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypotension

PICC placement


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 63 male with a history of end-stage liver disease secondary
to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, seizure disorder, type 2
diabetes, hypothyroidism presents with fevers and hypotension
and profound dehydration from [**Hospital1 **].  Per their records, he
had been having fevers for several days.  It was considered that
he could have a nasal source from chronic dobhoff.  Ceftaz was
started, and then was changed to meropenem several days prior to
admission.  He has continued to spike through that and motrin.
.
He has poor baseline functional status, and is not able to
relate any complaints.  Comparing records, his mental status
appears to be better on admission than it had been since his
discharge.  He had some green diarrhea on the day prior to
presentation and his blood sugars had been very high for the
past several days (300's).
.
Of note, patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-10-26**]
after prolonged admission since [**2198-8-2**], originally admitted for
convulsive status epilepticus. He was treated for his seizures,
which were felt secondary to his elevated ammonia level. He also
developed sepsis and was started on CVVH. His blood cultures at
that time had coag negative staph and vanco-sensitive
enterococcus. He also had an episode of VT and an echo at the
time revealed a decreased EF of approximately 40%.
.
ED Course: He was hypotensive to 60s on arrival.  He was given
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was in in acute renal
failure.   A subclavian line was placed.

Physical Exam on Admission:

Physical Examination:
VS Tm 101.2 Tc 97.4  98/52  78  28  100% on 35% trach mask
General: Elderly, ill appearing male, lying in bed, NAD
HEENT: MMdry, white film on tongue, poor dentition, PERRL
Neck: supple, no LAD, trach in place, JVP flat
Lungs: Coarse BS bilaterally
Cardiac: Regular, II/VI HSM at apex, no S3 or S4
Abdomen: obese, sl distended, nt, pos BS
GU: No scrotal edema
Extr: Trace LE swelling.  Upper extremities with 2+ pitting
edema in the forearms.
Skin: Stage 2 coccyx ulcer.
Neuro: Arousable, followed simple commands like open mouth or
eyes.  Can barely move hands, and is not able to move toes.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: NSR 78 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, deep q in II, III, aVF.
GOod RWP.  Consistent with prior from [**2198-2-14**].
.
Imaging:
.
CXR: Persistent atelectasis within the right perihilar region
and left lung base. Tip of right subclavian central venous
catheter overlie the proximal right atrium. Recommend partially
withdrawing.
.
Abd u/s [**11-2**] FINDINGS: There is no ascites identified in the
abdomen. No new liver masses are identified, and there is no
biliary dilatation identified. Doppler examination of the TIPS
shunt demonstrate flow within the shunt which is wall- to-wall,
however, the distal portion of the shunt shows some narrowing.
Velocities within the TIPS shunt are 30, 96, and 282 in the
proximal, mid and distal portions respectively. Elevated
velocities within the distal portion are concerning for a distal
stenosis. Flow in the main portal vein is hepatopetal and is 44
cm/sec. Some flow away from the TIPS shunt is identified within
the anterior right portal vein. Flow within the left portal vein
is still demonstrated towards the TIPS shunt on this exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P [**11-11**]: 63M h/o ESLD [**1-19**] NASH, HCC, seizure disorder, DM2,
hypothyroidism, poor baseline mental status (unable to speak,
unable to move extremities at baseline per wife), admitted from
rehab via [**Name (NI) **] with fevers, hypotension, profound dehydration, and
electrolyte derangements, now with improved mental status after
rehydration.
.
# Fevers/hypotension: His initial presentation was felt to be
concerning for sepsis in light of fevers prior to admission.
Patient was determined to be severely hypovolemic in the ED, and
was given 7 liters of normal saline.  His BP improved and has
since remained stable.  The possible sources of infection were
felt to include decubitus ulcer, GI/diarrhea, UTI, pulmonary.
He was initially covered with linezolid with history of VRE,
which was switched to daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and
metronidazole for broad coverage.  His chest x-ray showed no
pneumonia.  He had no recurrent fevers and blood and urine
cultures and stool C. diff were negative.  His antibiotics were
subsequently removed and his vitals remained stable.  Given this
clinical picture, hypovolemia from dehydration rather than
sepsis was considered the most likely cause of hypotension.
.
# Seizures: Patient had a recent prolonged admission with
refractory seizures, necessitating pentobarbital coma at one
point.  Seizures during his prior admission were primarily
absence in nature, as he would stare off and become
non-responsive, but no rhythmic motions were noted.  The
Epilepsy service was consulted to assist with management of his
several anti-epileptics.  Given his low albumin, corrected
phenytoin levels (goal 20-30) and free phenytoin levels (goal
2-2.5) were followed.  His phenytoin dose was slightly
decreased.  Continuous EEG monitoring x 2 days demonstrated slow
background but no rhythmic epileptiform activities, ruling out
subclinical seizures.  He was continued on his prior regimen of
phenytoin (at a lower dose), zonismaide, levetiracetam, and
topiramate.  He was also placed on lorazepam 0.75 mg TID for
seizure prophylaxis in the setting of lowered seizure threshold.
 His phenytoin dose was further decreased to 150mg per PEG TID
after his free phenytoin level returned elevated at 2.9.  He
should have a free phenytoin level checked on [**2198-11-16**] and again
on [**2198-11-19**], and the results should be communicated to Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3506**].  She will determine any further dose
adjustments.  He should also continue on his current dose of
lorazepam until [**2198-11-26**], when it should be decreased to 0.5mg
IV Q8H.  He was discharged on these medications with follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70525**].  Please contact her at the above number for
any questions regarding his antiepileptic medication regimen.
.
# AMS: Although patient is minimally responsive to commands,
this current mental status and functional status (rigidity and
limited ability to move extremities) is his new baseline. Wife
stated patient is the "best" he has been since [**2198-7-18**].  He
had periods of increased lucidity with orientation to person and
place.  His ammonia was followed and was found to be higher than
previous levels.  He was maintained on lactulose and his
rifaximin was increased.  Antiepileptic management as above.  He
remained at his baseline mental status for the remainder of his
stay.
.
# UGIB: On [**11-8**], patient had coffee-ground emesis.  His Dobhoff
was removed and tube feedings were held.  Noticed some brown
mucous at trach site.  NG lavage showed coffee grounds but no
bright red blood.  His Hct was stable from prior days at 24.9.
He received 3 U PRBCs with an increase in his Hct to 30.9.  His
aspirin and SC heparin were held, and he
