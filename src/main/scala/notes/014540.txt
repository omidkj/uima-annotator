History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5715**] is a 49 year old woman with h/o genital herpes who is
being transferred from the MICU to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7 because of improvement
of her hypoxia, but now with resolving nausea and vomiting
likely causing metabolic alkalosis.

Two weeks prior to admission, while driving home after visiting
her daughter at [**Hospital3 15054**] [**Name (NI) 5169**], she had sudden aches in her
hips, knees, and ankles. She also noticed swelling in her
ankles. The following day, she noticed a rash on her left leg
that eventually spread throughout her body. Per her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
rash was diffuse, erythematous, and blanching. It covered her
chest, back, arms, and legs, but spared her palms and soles. Her
PCP instructed her to use hydroxyzine and ibuprofen for relief,
but the rash persisted and because purpuric. At the same time,
she had fevers, with temperatures to 103.9. She began having
worsening dyspnea and cough. She also had body aches and joint
swelling. She was seen in rheumatology clinic and, from there,
was sent to the ED for further workup.
.
In the ED, her vital signs were 100.9, 102, 110/69, 22, and 99%
on RA. Neurology was consulted and an LP was attempted but could
not be performed. She received 2 L NS, acetaminophen, albuterol
and diazepam. She was then transferred to CC-7 for further
management. While on the floor, the patient triggered twice for
tachypnea and low oxygen saturation down to 84% on RA. Her
pulmonary symptoms dramatically progressed and CXR findings were
consistent with multilobar PNA (especially LLL). She was started
on Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, and Doxycycline. She was then
transferred to the MICU for further work-up of her hypoxia.
.
In the MICU, her vital signs were 98.2 112/58 112 28 93% on 6L.
She was continued on vancomycin, zosyn, levofloxacin, and
doxycycline. Viral serologies were already pending. ID was
consulted, but urine legionella Ag returned positive. Repeat CXR
showed interval progression of multilobar pneumonia and she
underwent thoracentesis of L pleural effusion. She did not
require intubation. While in the MICU, she began having nausea
and vomiting on and off. She was treated with zofran with good
improvement, but the nausea and vomiting continued.
Occasionally, the nausea comes on while eating, but improves
with cessation of eating. Percocet and anything with codeine
seemed to make the nausea worse. Over the next few days, her
respiratory status improved significantly, pt weaned from NRB to
4L NC. On transfer, she continues to have nausea and vomiting
and diffuse jt aches/fatigue. Otherwise denying CP/abd pain.

Social History:
She is married with three children. She has a 20 pack year
smoking history and currently smokes one pack per day. She
denies alcohol or illicit drugs.

Pertinent Results:
Labs on transfer to the medicine floor
Chem [**7-28**]: 139/4.3/100/36/6/0.3/104
ABG [**7-28**]: 7.46/56/93/40
Hct 27.0 Plt 470
.
CXR [**7-27**]:
1. Left-sided PICC terminating in the mid SVC.
2. Slight improvement in apical consolidations, but persistent
diffuse bilateral airspace opacities.
.
CXR [**7-26**]: The current study demonstrates interval progression in
the right lower lobe consolidation with unchanged appearance of
extensive left lower lobe and left upper lobe airspace
opacities, finding consistent with progression of the known
pneumonia that might be complicated by interval development of
ARDS. Bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded. Overall,
no findings to suggest pulmonary edema.
.
LE US [**7-25**]: No evidence of lower extremity DVT bilaterally.
.
CXR [**7-23**]: Marked interval worsening of airspace opacities and
bilateral pleural effusions, particularly worse on the left side
when compared to [**2113-7-20**]. Pneumonia is not excluded. There is
likely superimposed pulmonary edema.
.
CTA Chest [**7-21**]:
1. Negative examination for PE.
2. Left lower lobe consolidation and multifocal pneumonia in the
other lung fields.
3. Small left parapneumonic pleural effusion.
4. Bilateral left more than right axillary lymphadenopathy.
Clinical
evaluation is recommended since the patient is status post
breast implant.
.
CXR [**7-20**]: In comparison with the study of [**7-18**], there has been
development of increased opacification, consistent with a lower
lobe pneumonia. There may well be an associated pleural
effusion.
.
EKG: sinus at 90 bpm, normal axis, normal intervals, low voltage
in limb leads, ? LAA, no RAA, LVH or RVH, No ST-segment or TW
changes in lateral, inferior leads, TWI in lead V2 anteriorly,
but no ST-segment changes.
.
CXR [**7-18**]: AP chest radiograph compared to [**2107-6-21**] shows no
change. The lungs are clear. The heart, mediastinum, hila and
pulmonary vascularity are normal.  There is no pleural effusion
or pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5715**] is a 49 year old woman with h/o genital herpes who is
called out from MICU after course with severe legionella PNA,
never requiring intubation. Pt is currently sating well on 4L NC
with metabolic alkalosis thought due to N/V.

1)Pneumonia/ respiratory distress- On admission the patient had
a clear CXR.  Had an asthma attack in the ED, and then another
asthma attack on [**7-19**].  Both responded immediately to albuterol.
 Since the second attack she has had persistent coughing
productive of clear sputum.  Found on CXR on [**7-20**] to have a
large pneumonia and she was started on azithromycin and
ceftriaxone.  She continued to require increasing O2 to maintain
her saturation.  On [**7-21**] she went for CTA which was negative for
PE.  It is unclear if this PNA is related to her underlying
presenting symptoms or if this is a superimposed process.  On
[**7-21**] her antibiotics were broadened to vanc, increased dose of
ceftriaxone, azithro, and doxycycline.  She continued to receive
albuterol and atrovent nebs as needed.  Pulmonary was consulted
and a sp
