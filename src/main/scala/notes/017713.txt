Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Lasix / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
L-anterior CP; hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 89F from [**Hospital3 **] with L ant CP [**4-2**] worse w/ deep
inspiration, + nausea/emesis, no diaphoresis. Duration of CP x1
hour. Brought in per EMS, EKG difficult to interpret, LBBB HR
80s-paced, initial CE negative x1. Was unable to give any
Nitrates or morphine due to low SBP. CP resolved w/o any
medications or interventions. She was given ASA 325x1, CTA done
to r/o PE, which was negative. Pt stated that she has been
having trouble swallowing x1-2 weeks due to nausea and inability
to swallow. She's had poor PO intake since then, with some fluid
intake and weight loss. She has no idea why she can't swallow
and is frustrated by this. Of note, she had a recent admission
to [**Hospital6 4287**] where she was found to have oral thrush
and was presumed to have oropharyngeal [**Female First Name (un) **]; a barium swallow
was normal.  Has also had diarrhea for several days.
.
ED course: Initial VS T 100.8 Rectally, HR 80-paced, BP 95/56
then dropped to 88/44 MAP 60; RR 13 95%RA. Received 1.7 LNS
w/improvement in her SBP. Attempt at placing R and L-IJ
unsuccessful, unable to pass guidewire. Successfully placed
R-femoral line. Pt also noted to be guaiac + w/brown stools,
also noted to have Bright Red Blood in vaginal vault. ?
prolapsed uterus. Given increased INR did not proceed w/vaginal
exam w/speculum due to ?friable bleeding tissue. CT
chest/abd/pelvis done. She received Levo/Vanco/Flagyl.
.
Of note this is her 3rd hospitalization in 1month. 1st
hospitalization at [**Hospital3 2568**] Hosp-Kidney stones s/p stent. 2nd
hospitalization at [**Hospital1 96085**], Bacteremia, unclear about [**Name (NI) **] and
duration. At her baseline A&Ox3, bed bound per [**Hospital3 **]
staff. Uses diapers not due to incontinence but b/c bedbound.
Staff at [**Hospital3 **] denied documentation of BRBPR or blood
in stool or vagina. She's had a swallow study/barium
study-->report not in record at [**Location (un) **].
.
On review of systems, the pt. denied recent fever or chills.
+HA, No vision changes. Hard of hearing R-ear. Denied cough,
shortness of breath. Chest pain-resolved, no palpitations. +N/V
x1-2 weeks, no abdominal pain. No dysuria. She's unsure whether
she's had blood from below-rectally or vaginally. Denied
arthralgias or myalgias. Per niece has had ~50pound weight loss
this year.

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis [**2187-12-3**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
3. Severe coronary artery calcifications.
4. Multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, too small
to characterize.
5. Dilatation of main pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension.
6. Right ureteral stent.
7. Multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes, which do not meet
size criteria for pathologic enlargement.
8. Large calcified uterine fibroids.
.
CXR [**2187-12-4**]:
Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions new
since [**12-2**] are unchanged over two hours. There is no
pneumothorax. No central venous line or drainage tube projects
over the chest. A transvenous right ventricular pacer lead is
unchanged in position and at least one nephrostomy tube is seen
in the right upper quadrant. No pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**2187-12-3**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
KUB [**2187-12-9**]: The right double-J stent is again visualized.
Calcified fibroids in the pelvis are again seen. Contrast is
seen in nondistended colon. Small bowel loops are mildly dilated
up to 3.5 cm. No air-fluid levels are seen. This most likely
represents an ileus. Small bilateral effusions are present.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 89 yo F w/ h/o CAD s/p MI, pacer, CHF, AF,
p/w hypotension, N/V and poor PO intake, improved with aggresive
IVF, with likely candidal esophagitis contributing to poor PO
contributing to hypotension, with clostridium difficile colitis.

.
1 Hypotension: Pt has had poor PO intake x1-2 weeks (likely
longer), nausea, vomitting, diarrhea as well. Hypotension most
likely hypovolemic in nature. Pt w/some note of bright red blood
in vaginal area in ED, however this may have been secondary to
attempted line placement and her HCT remained stable. Cardiac
etiology less likely despite chest pain, ECG unchanged here,
cardiac enzymes negative x3 on admission. Sepsis was possible
given elevated WBC on admission (now normal), source possible
UTI though culture did not grow anything except yeast (not
present in UA), no tachycardia but paced, lactate normal, blood
cultures [**2187-12-2**] no growth x4. She was mentating normally, with
good urine output. Diarrhea was noted prior to admission, no BM
from admission thru [**12-7**], then diarrhea, c.difficile positive,
may have been contributing to initial presentation. She was
treated with 7 days of ciprofloxacin for potential urinary tract
infection. She was started on oral flagyl for clostridium
difficile infection and will need to complete a 14 day course.
She was restarted on metoprololXL on [*
