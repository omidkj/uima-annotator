Chief Complaint:
61 y/o male adm. to OSH 12 days PTA w/C/O abd. bloating, LE
edema & fatigue, found to be in CHF, natrecor started.  Cath
revealed LM & 3vCAD, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for CABG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CABG X 4 ([**2186-7-17**])


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who presented with congestive
heart failure, left lower extremity edema and ascites. He has a
history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction. It was elected to
proceed with bypass surgery. The patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**Hospital **] Medical Center and was treated for heart failure and
liver dysfunction prior to surgery. A Cardiac catheterization
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease with an ejection
fraction of 25%, He was thus referred for CABG

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to hospital, on cardiac surgery service.  Heart failure
service consulted, recommended diuresis pre-operatively.  He was
subsequently started on a Lasix drip. Hepatology also consulted,
recommending preoperative ultrasound and abdominal CT scan. The
RUQ ultrasound showed normal portal venous flow and two small
gallbladder polyps. The abdominal scan was essentially
unremarkable - there was no focal liver lesions, with only a
small amount of perihepatic ascites. He otherwise remained
stable on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for
surgery.

On [**7-17**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed four vessel coronary artery
bypass grafting utilizing the left internal mammary artery to
the diagonal branch of left
anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the distal
left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex, saphenous vein graft
to the posterior descending coronary artery. Postoperative echo
was notable for a LVEF of 20% with no mitral regurgitation or
aortic insufficiency.

After the operation, he was brought to the CSRU. Within 24
hours, chest tubes were removed and he was extubated. He was
slow to wean from inotropic support and initially required AV
pacing for junctional rhythm. Beta blockade was initially
withheld. The EP service was consulted to evaluate for permanent
pacemaker plus/minus AICD(given his severely depressed LV
function). He concomitantly experienced aphonia. Bedside swallow
examination showed bilateral vocal cord paralysis, diffuse
pharyngeal weakness and silent aspiration. He was subsequently
made NPO and started on tube feedings. Over several days, his
native heart rate improved to the 80's. Epicardial wires were
eventually removed without complication. He otherwise remained
stable on medical therapy. It was decided that a pacemaker was
not indicated at this time but the need for an AICD will need to
be assessed three months postoperatively.

On postoperative day five, he transferred to the Step Down Unit.
 He continued to require diuresis and remained stable from a
cardiac and liver standpoint. Beta blockade was not resumed.
Over several days, he made clinical improvements as he worked
daily with physical therapy. At discharge, his oxygen
saturations were 99% on room air.

His aphonia gradually improved. Repeat bedside swallow
examination showed no signs of aspiration with pureed diet.
Aspiration was however noted with thin liquids. Videofluroscopic
evaluation on [**7-24**] confirmed aspiration but functional
swallow was achieved with pureed/ground solids and honey thick
liquids. Medications were subsequently crushed in puree and
repeat videoswallow was recommended in one week to evaluate for
diet advancement. By discharge, he was tolerating solids without
difficulty.

He was eventually cleared for discharge on postoperative day
five. He will follow up in [**Location (un) 37361**], RI on [**7-27**] and again
in two weeks.
