Mrs. [**Known lastname 83534**] was admitted to the hospital and urgently taken
to the Operating Room due  to her anemia and hypotension post

and returned to the PACU in stable condition.

Following her post op recovery she was transferred to the
Surgical floor where she continued to make steady progress.  Her
pain was controlled with a PCA and her hematocrit was followed
on a daily basis and stable in the 27 range.  She had return of
bowel function and her diet was gradually increased from clears
to regular and tolerated well.  Her blood sugars were well
controlled post op on her home doses of insulin.

She was seen by the Physical Therapy service for a full
evaluation and required assistance early post op but was
gradually able to ambulate on her own.  Her wound was healing
