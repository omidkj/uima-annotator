Allergies:
Tetracyclines

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a [**Age over 90 **]yo woman with dementia who presents with CHF
x 2 day likely due to a three day medication holiday.  Her
daughter stopped all of pt's meds after developing a hot red
rash on her trunk and back, likely due to addition of glyburide.
 After all of her meds were discontinued, visiting nurse [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 38561**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 608**] found pt to be in new A fib with slight CHF.
Restarted pt's meds and added Zyrtec for the rash.  Pt reported
slight improvement the following day (Friday).  Over the
weekend, pt's shortness of breath worsened.  Pt presented to ED
via EMS with O2 sats to 80's% on RA, which increased to 90's on
100%NRB, with CXR showing moderate CHF.  Rash is improving, and
pt diuresed in ED with IV Lasix.  Still in A fib at rate of 125.

[**2128-9-7**] 08:00AM   TSH-1.8

EKG:
Rapid atrial fibrillation. Scooped ST segment depression in
leads I and II.
Horizontal ST segment depressions in leads V4-V6. T wave
inversion in lead aVL.
QS deflections in lead VI and QR complexes in lead III,
unsupported by
neighboring leads for infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities. Scooped
depressions suggest the possibility of digitalis effect.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2126-2-26**] sinus rhythm was previously present
with atrial
ectopy.

CXR:
Moderate left ventricular heart failure. Increased opacity at
the right lung base which may represent an evolving infiltrate.

Transthoracic ECHO:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened.

Transesophageal ECHO:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 3.
There are complex (>4mm and/or mobile) atheroma in the aortic
arch and descending thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo woman presenting with decompensated CHF
due to new A fib with RVR, right lower lobe pneumonia, and rash
thought to be due to Glyburide. Protracted stay complicated by
recurrent Afib.

1.Pump: Decompensated CHF due to three day drug holiday, causing
volume overload and hence atrial fibrillation. Pt was diuresed
with IV lasix.  Echo revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy
with LVEF of 50-55%. Pt will continue an ACE inhibitor for
afterload reduction.

2.Rhythm: New onset A fib on admission with rapid ventricular
response to 140's. Pt was initially rate controlled with a
diltiazem drip, and then switched to oral metoprolol.  Digoxin
was not started due to left ventricular hypertrophy and 50-55%
ejection fraction.  Pt was cardioverted on [**9-9**] after a
negative TEE, and remained in normal sinus rhythm.  She was
started on disopyramide for rate and rhythm control and for the
negative inotropy effect given the hypertrohphic LV.  After
determining that she has not fallen in four years, pt was
anticoagulated with coumadin using a heparin bridge, with an INR
goal of 2.0. She remained in NSR until [**2128-9-15**] when she had
transfusion reaction and dropped her BP. She went back into Afib
and could not be rate controlled by lopressor x3 and BP not
responsive to fluid. DCCV was tried, she converted to NSR for 10
beats and then back in Afib again. She recieved ibutilide until
convert to NSR and transferred to the unit b/c still hypotensive
and started only on amiodarone 400 QD. She was in sinus until
[**9-17**], when she converted back to rapid AF with hemodynamic
compromise. After 1mg of ibutilide, she converted back to NSR.
Amiodarone dose was increased to 400 TID and she remained in NSR
since then.

3.Coronories: Pt has a history of hypertension, presenting with
lateral ST elevations on EKG.  She ruled out for MI.  She will
continue beta-blocker, ACE, and aspirin.

4. Lungs:
Patinet had Right lower lobe pneumonia on admission and was
started on Levofloxacin 250mg po qd on [**9-7**] for a seven day
course. During her second Afib episode, she may have aspirated
during sedation for DCCV. CXR could not exclude left basilar
infiltrate and she was then started on levoflxacin and flagyl.

5.Acute renal failure: Pt presented with a creatinine of 1.3
which improved during hospitalization.

6.Multi-infarct dementia: Stable.

7.Drug rash likely d/t Glyburide: Rash was improving on Zyrtec
and off Glyburide.

8.Type II Diabetes: Pt's blood sugars were initially controlled
with an insulin sliding scale given her rash to each Metformin
and Glyburide.  She was started on Repaglinide without adverse
effects and with better blood glucose control.

9. Heme:Patient had dropping Hct, presumably from bleeding into
skin due to over anticoagulation. Hematology consult excluded
warfarin induced necrosis. DIC panel and hemolysis were negative

10. Abdominal pain:Patietn developed acute abdomen. CT abdomen
on [**9-13**] showed hematoma in subcutaneous tissue of left lateral
wall, no obstruction, no stool impaction. Symptoms gradually
resolved. She was very constipated and given fleet enema with
good result. She was guiac negative.
