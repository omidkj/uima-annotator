Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 46126**]
Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain, jaundice, malaise



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-27**] ERCP
[**8-31**] Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative
cholangiogram, umbilical hernia repair.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65yo M with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy
who was transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with progressive RUQ
pain, jaundice and malaise found to have cholangitis. The
patient presented to the OSH after experiencing 5 days of
subjective fevers, chills and progressive malaise, jaundice,
diffuse epigastric pain,nausea and diminished appetite/po
intake. Pt also noted darker urine and lighter stools and
difficulty urinating despite sensation of bladder
fullness/abdominal distention. At OSH pt was found to be
hypotensive with sbp 80's-90's, and labs notable for elevated
WBC 20.5, 21% bands, Cr 4.4. Tbili 13.6 Dbili 13.2.RUQ
ultrasound showed cholecystitis with CBD dilatation 8cm, no
stones. Right IJ was placed and fluid resuscitation with NS was
started, but pressors were not started. Pt was started on zosyn.
Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

On arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt had received 3L NS. Initial VS were:
98.1 80 98/50 16 99% on 2L. CVP 10. Pt was started on levophed
ggt at 0.06mcg/kg/min (wt 80mg, set at 9ml/hr) for hypotension
despite fluid resuscitation. Labs notable for: wbc: 15.8
(N:86.9%) h/h: 12.6/36.8; plt 57, ALT: 164 AST: 100 AP: 142
Tbili: 10.5 Alb: 2.7, trop 0.03. Pt was evaluated by surgery who
recommended admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ERCP.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. 98.7, 108/58, 96, 20, 90%
on 2L.Pt received 280cc NS and levophed weaned off before ERCP
was performed.

Of note, Pt was admtted to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**2148-10-21**] with new
onset CHF. TTE during that admission showed an EF<15%, a
severely dilated left ventricle, severe global hypokinesis of
left ventricle, right ventricular systolic function is mild to
moderately reduced and moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.

[**8-27**] ECG Sinus rhythm. There is a non-specific intraventricular
conduction delay. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to
tracing #1 there is no significant change.

[**8-28**] Liver/gallbladder U/S
1.  Coarse heterogeneous echotexture of the liver, consistent
with underlying
liver disease.  Intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation,
recommended an MRCP for further assessment to evaluate the cause
of obstruction.
2.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

[**8-28**] Echocardiogram
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis.
The anterior wall and apex contract best (LVEF = 25-30%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). The
left ventricular apex is heavily trabeculated, but no discrete
thrombus is seen. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
marked cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.

[**8-27**] ERCP
Procedures: Given cholangitis, a 5cm by 10mm double pig tail
biliary stent was placed successfully in the main duct.

Impression: Normal major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary
duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome using a
free-hand technique.
Multiple stones were seen at the biliary tree. The CBD was not
dilated.
Given cholangitis, limited contrast injection was made. Given
cholangitis, a 5cm by 10mm double pig tail biliary stent was
placed successfully in the main duct.

[**8-28**] Abdominal KUB
Diffuse prominent gas-filled  small and large bowel loops with
paucity of gas distally may represent ileus. Early distal
obstruction is not excluded.

[**8-31**] Intraoperative cholangiogram shows contrast opacification
of the
common bile duct, flow of contrast into the extrahepatic and
intrahepatic
biliary tree.  There is also flow of contrast seen into the gut.
 No filling defect was seen.

[**9-1**] CXR (AP)
Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance including

mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly.  There is interval development of
interstitial pulmonary edema but no focal consolidation to
suggest infection or pleural effusion demonstrated.  The
evaluation of the patient after diuresis is suggested.

[**9-1**] CXR (AP)
Lung volumes have improved and previous mild pulmonary edema has
cleared.  Heart is mildly enlarged as before, but azygous
distension has resolved indicating an improvement in central
venous pressure.
