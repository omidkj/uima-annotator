Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 10493**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
transfused 4 units pRBCs
transfused 2 units FFP

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81F with a hx of CHF (EF 50%) and PE diagnosed in
[**3-15**] (on Coumadin) who presented after OSH labs showed a Hct of
18.1 (baseline Hct since [**7-15**] 28-33)and INR of 11.7.  Her PCP,
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] was notified and informed the patient.  The
patient reports that she is on alternating doses of coumadin
daily.  She thinks that she may have doubled the doses the past
couple of days.
.
Her ROS is significant for episodes of LH within the last week,
as well as 2 episodes of diarrhea.  She also reports chest/abd
pain in a "horseshoe" distribution. She denies any hematemesis,
hematochezia, BRBPR or melanotic stools.
.
In the ED the patient's Hct was noted to be 15.2, INR was 22.8.
WBC was elevated at 13.0 and her UA was positive.  NG lavage
(500cc) was negative.  Per report rectal exam was significant
for frank melanotic stools.  EKG showed NSR 82, LBBB unchanged
from prior EKG on [**2198-10-22**], and poor R wave progression.  In the
setting of LBBB pattern, difficult to interpret ischemic
changes.  The patient received 2U FFP, 2 PRBCs, vitamin K 5 SC,
and 40mg IV PPI.

trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
2) PE: Diagnosed in [**3-15**], on Coumadin. INR subtherapeutic last
admission so she was heparinized until INR > 2.
3) GERD
4) HTN
5) Meniere's disease
.
SURGHX:

Brief Hospital Course:
81F with MMP who presents with LGIB in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR in setting of coumadin doasge errors.
.
# LGIB:
Patient was admitted with Hct 15.2 and INR 22.8.  NG lavage was
negative.  Transferred to the ICU where received total of 4
units of pRBCs with good response in Hct to 26.8 and 2 units FFP
with good response in INR from 22.8 to 2.8.  Also received Vit K
5 mg sc.  Patient refused endoscopic intervention.  Her vitals
and Hct remained stable in the ICU and she was transferred to
the floor. Hct remained stable while on the general medicine
wards.
.
Patient' PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] expalined the purpose, risk, benefits
of EGD and colonoscopy. Pt stated that she has lived a long life
and now just wants some peace and quiet. She is not worried
about the procedure itself or the pain/discomfort she may
experience. It is a quality of life issue and since she is
stable now, she does not wish to undergo further interventions.
She simply wants to be with her cat at home.
.
# H/o PE:
Spoke with patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**], who said that patient
has been on Coumadin since [**Month (only) 547**]. He left it to the discretion
of the ICU team if Coumadin should be stopped since she's been
treated for 9 months. In the past, per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has not
taken coumadin as instructed and, at times, taking too much. In
setting of GI bleed of [**Last Name (un) 5487**] etiology, uncertainty regarding
whether patient acutally had a PE in the past, and pt's
inability to follow dosing instructions, she is at risk for
life-threatening bleeding and the coumadin was stopped.
.
# CHF:
Pt with hx of CHF with EF 50%. Cardiac enzymes negative during
hospital course. Pt with hx of pulomary edema secondary to heart
failure. Pt resucitated with blood and ffp, without diueresis as
respiratory status stable. Sats >94% on RA. Held ASA and BP meds
in setting of GIB. BP meds restarted on discharge, PCP will
determine when to restart aspirin at followup visit.
.
#. UTI:
Patient had no symptoms or signs of UTI despite equivocal UA.
Received fluoroquinolone initially but was subsequently held for
concern of increasing INR.
.
# PPX:
-no anticoagulation now
-PPI
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
.
# DISPO
Discharged to home as patient did not prefer GI evaluation. To
followup with PCP.
