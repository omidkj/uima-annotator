Service:  ACOVE Medicine Service

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54-year-old
Asian male who originally presented on [**2133-5-29**]
complaining of a several day history of shortness of breath,
cough with the production of yellow sputum, with bilateral
lower extremity edema times three weeks (which is new for the
patient).  He described as sudden in onset and worse with
exertion.

In the Emergency Department, a chest x-ray showed a large
left pleural effusion.  Negative for pulmonary embolism.  He
reports a chronic cough for three years (occasionally
blood-tinged).

At the time of admission, the patient denied chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, or
sick contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] reports a prior history of a left pleural
effusion consistent with pneumonia which was not tapped and
resolved on its own.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's urine noted to be
light brown with dark tinge in color which was new for him.
Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 32 and 1.8.  His
baseline creatinine is 0.8.  Originally felt to be prerenal
secondary to dehydration.  The patient was hydrated with
resolution.  Urinalysis revealed microhematuria.

For pleural effusion, underwent thoracentesis on [**2133-5-30**]
with 4000 cc removed.  The patient reportedly felt transient
relief of shortness of breath; however, he had an episode of
chest tightness.  Tachypnea overnight; from [**2133-5-30**] to
[**2133-5-31**] with decreasing oxygen saturations to 89% to 90%
on 3 liters nasal cannula.

On [**2133-5-31**] the patient underwent ultrasound-guided
thoracentesis with 1400 cc of pleural fluid removed.  A small
left apical pneumothorax was noted after repeat
thoracentesis.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit on [**2133-5-31**] for increased work of breathing,
hypoxia, and tachypnea.  Felt need for closer oxygen
monitoring by Pulmonary Intensive Care Unit team.

male, age appropriate, well-nourished, comfortable, and in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat

anicteric.  Oral mucosa were moist.  The neck was supple.  No
masses.  No lymphadenopathy.  Positive jugular venous
distention to the angle of the jaw at 45 degrees.  Lung
examination revealed right bronchial breath sounds.  Left
lobe with decreased breath sounds at the bases.  Crackles to
one-third of the way up.  Cardiovascular examination revealed
tachycardia.  First heart sound and second heart sound.  No
audible murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Question third heart
sound.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.
Positive bowel sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremity
examination revealed positive lower extremity edema.  No
clubbing or cyanosis noted.

hematocrit was 26.7, and platelets were 441.  Sodium was 136,
potassium was 4.4, bicarbonate was 23, blood urea nitrogen

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia [**Company 104132**] wave inversions in V1.  No ST
changes.

A chest x-ray on [**5-31**] revealed apical left pneumothorax,
right opacification of hemithorax, a small pleural effusion
(decreased from [**2133-5-29**] study).

A renal ultrasound revealed both kidneys were swollen and
echogenic in appearance; in keep with the patient's stated
history of acute renal failure.  A small amount of fluid in
the pelvis. No hydronephrosis.

A computed tomography angiogram on [**5-29**] showed no pulmonary
embolism.  Stable right axillary lymphadenopathy.  Multiple
patchy opacities in the left upper lobe with ground-glass
basilar opacities.  Moderate left pleural effusion.

SIGNIFICANT HOSPITAL STUDIES:  (During the patient's stay,
the patient had numerous radiologic studies performed)

1.  A computed tomography angiogram of the chest with and
without contrast and reconstruction with findings which
demonstrated an interval development of left-sided pleural
effusion and patchy opacities in the left lung.  Clinical
picture could represent infectious cause although there was
concern for the development of metastases.  No pulmonary
embolism.  Multiple cavitated vegetations of the right lung.

2.  Multiple chest x-rays repeatedly showing a left-sided
pleural effusion with opacification of the right chest wall.
Most studies were used to gage the extent and reaccumulation
of pleural fluid.

3.  A renal ultrasound showed swollen echogenic kidneys; in
keeping with a history of possible acute renal failure.  No
evidence of hydronephrosis.  No evidence of a mass or stone.

4.  A magnetic resonance imaging of the chest and mediastinum
with and without contrast following was recent ultrasound
examination demonstrated thrombosis of the left internal
jugular vein, occlusion versus narrowing of the left
brachiocephalic vein, consolidation of the left upper lobe
and lingula, multiple cavitations in the right upper lobe,
and a large left pleural effusion.

5.  Bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies showed no
evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

6.  Magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography
of the abdomen, pelvis, and kidneys showed no evidence of
tumor within the abdomen, pelvis, or kidneys.  It showed a
moderate left-sided pleural effusion.  No evidence of renal
vein thrombosis.  This was considered negative for
malignancy.

7.  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was obtained to
evaluate for pericardial constriction showed a normal left
ventricular cavity size, with normal regional and global
ventricular systolic function, normal right ventricular
cavity size.  No myocardial infarction evidence, pericardial
thickening, adhesions, or reconstruction.  A large left
pleural effusion and evidence of increased intravascular
pressure.  Overall, no evidence of pericardial constriction.

8.  The patient refused two additional studies that we
