History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old male who
underwent tissue aortic valve replacement in [**2150-12-29**] Medical Center. While recovering in [**State 108**] in [**2151-3-29**], he experienced left sided chest pain at rest. Cardiac
catheterization revealed significant multivessel coronary artery
disease with preserved EF. Cardiac surgeon in [**State 108**]
recommended
surgical revascularization but he has decided to return to
[**Location (un) 86**]
for medical care. Since [**2151-3-29**], he has experienced no
further
chest pain. He currently admits to exertional shortness of
breath
and increasing fatigue. He denies orthopnea, PND, pedal edema
and
syncope.

Pertinent Results:
Intra-op echo:
Pre-bypass: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis leaflets
appear to move normally. The mean transaortic gradient is 13 mm
Hg at a cardiac output of 5.5 L/min and is normal.. Mild (1+)
transvalvular aortic regurgitation is seen with no paravalvular
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass: The patient is receiving no inotropic support
post-CPB. Biventricular systolic function is preserved and all
findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings. The aorta is
intact post-decannulation. All findings were communicated to the
surgeon intraoperatively.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2151-7-6**] where the patient underwent CABG X5
(LIMA-LAD, SVG OM, SVG to RI, SVG to PDA, SVG to Diag).  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.  On POD #1  the patient weaned and
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on
no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD four the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
