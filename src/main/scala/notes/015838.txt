escalated in the context of generalized malaise. She developed a
pleuritic component and fevers and chills. She had small

ibuprofen, vancomycin 1g, levofloxacin 750mg, metronidazole
500mg, osteltamivir 75mg, and started on norepinepherine. She
was fluid resusitated with 4L NS. A chest xray showed a large
RML infiltrate and abdominal CT was benign. Her vital signs
improved and she was sent to the MICU on 0.30mcg/kg/min with VSS
of T 97.4 BP 95/34 P 88 R 17 98% on 2L NC.

.
[**10-27**] CXR:  There is no significant change in the widespread
parenchymal opacities which potentially might represent a
combination of pulmonary edema with infection.  Right upper lobe
consolidation is unchanged. Overall, the lung volumes are lower
than on the prior study.
.
[**10-26**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Right upper lobe consolidation, partially imaged, consistent
with
pneumonia. Please refer to chest x-ray obtained earlier for
further
characterization.
2. Small right pleural effusion.
3. No evidence of bowel obstruction.
4. Right adnexal cystic lesion, slightly increased in size.
Further
evaluation with non-urgent pelvic ultrasound is recommended,
given presumed postmenopausal state.
.
[**10-26**] CXR:  Right mid lung zone consolidation worrisome for
pneumonia. Follow-up chest radiograph after completion of
treatment is recommended to ensure resolution.

Brief Hospital Course:
58F with HTN, hypothyroidism, and likely COPD admitted with
fever, hypotension, and infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA
and sepsis. UA is also concerning for a UTI. Stablized on
pressors with improved oxygenation.
.
# Sepsis: Most likely source pneumonia vs. urosepsis. BCx were
negative to date, UCx contaminated but UA positive for UTI.  DFA
for influenza negative.  Patient initially maintained on
Norepinephrine for goal MAP > 65 and CVP > 10.  Patient
stabilized, weaned off pressors. She remained hemodynamically
stable and afebrile.
.
# Hypotension: Likely relate to sepsis. [**Last Name (un) **] stim test abnormal,
placed on Prednisone (stress dose). Repeat [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim was normal
x 2. She was discharged on steroid taper over 12 days.
.
# Pneumonia: CXR shows evidence of R mid lung pneumonia,
differential included typical vs atypical CAP, including
mycoplasma and Legionella, and influenza.  DFA for influenza
negative.  Urine Legionella antigen negative.  Patient
empirically started on Ceftriaxone for CAP and UTI, Azithromycin
for atypical coverage, and Osteltamivir for flu.  Respiratory
status improved, patient given Lasix with improvement of
respiratory status.  Patient will complete 10 day course of
antibiotics with cefpodoxime and azithromycin at home. Patient
should have CT chest with contrast to elucidate question of
malignancy, once stable.
.
# positive UA: UA consistent with UTI with elevated WBC, LE, and
nitrates, urine cx contaminated.  Treated with Ceftriaxone 1g IV
daily for PNA and transitioned to cefpodoxime at discharge.
Patient had no symptoms of UTI, no infection unlikely.
.
# Hypertension: On amlodipine 10mg daily and valsartan 160mg
daily at home. Antihypertensives held in the context of sepsis.
BPs remained borderline low for this patient (100/70 range) and
antihypertensives should be held at home until seen by PCP and
BP improved. Unclear why this patient is not on ASA PPx, and
should be discussed with PCP.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Medically managed. Thyroid studies nl.  Home
Levothyroxine [Levoxyl] 75 mcg daily.
.
# COPD: Exam finding of clubbing, hyperinflated chest, and
prolonged expiration consistent with chronic SOB and
obstruction. History of recurrent URIs also consistent with
chronic bronchitis. Recommend outpatient PFTs. Will follow up in
pulm clinic. Patient treated with nebs and discharged on steroid
taper.
.
#. chronic pain/neuropathy: Patient had hand tingling and
chronic back and knee pain. She was started on low dose
gabapentin with good effect and should be titrated as necessary
as outpatient. She was continued on home regimen tramadol and
percocet.
