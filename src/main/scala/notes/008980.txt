PROCEDURE NOTE IN DETAIL:

Informed consent was obtained outlining the risks, alternatives
and benefits
of the proposed procedure. The patient was then brought to the
CT department
and placed supine on the imaging table. A limited noncontrast
examination of
the lower abdomen was performed which again demonstrated a 4.6 x
8.1 cm
(axial)air and fluid collection in the anterior abdominal wall
near the
midline. The collection has increased slightly from the CT of 24
hours
previously. Note is made of some curvinear hyperdense material
lying
dependently within the fluid collection. This may represent
residual contrast
medium from the previously ingested oral contrast from the CT
examination of
24 hours previously. A suitable point for percutaneous catheter
placement was
identified slightly to the right of midline to avoid the
adjacent ostomy. An
appropriate axial section was marked on the patient's skin. The
area was
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure
huddle and
timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 18**] protocol.

Following administration of 6 cc of 1% buffered lidocaine to the
skin and
subcutaneous tissues, a 2-mm incision was made using an 11
blade. Under
intermittent CT fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-gauge [**Last Name (un) 4300**]
needle was advanced
and placed centrally within the fluid component of the
collection. Purulent
fluid was obtained. An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was then coiled within
the fluid
collection and the needle was removed. The tract was dilated
using a 7 French
fascial dilator and an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] pigtail catheter was
then advanced
into the fluid collection with the pigtail formed. 50 cc of
purulent fluid was
removed and the catheter was attached to a suction JP bulb. A
sample was sent
for microbiological assesment. A sterile dressing was applied
and the
catheter was secured using adhesive StatLock device ( the
catheter was not
sutured given the surrounding cellulitis).

Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well and there were
no early
complications. The patient was then transferred in stable
condition to the
ICU for further post-procedure monitoring.

IMPRESSION:
Uncomplicated placement of an 8 French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] pigtail catheter
into the
complex air and fluid-containing anterior abdominal wall
collection. 50cc of
purulent fluid was removed and a sample was sent for laboratory
assesment.
The collection contains hyperdense material which is of
uncertain etiology but
may represent delayed accumulation of oral contrast from the CT
of 24 hours
previously.
Overall, the patient tolerated the procedure well with no early
complications.

FINDINGS: Prior to the procedure, a non-contrast study of the
upper abdomen
was performed. This again showed an anterior abdominal wall
collection with
measuring 4.9 x 7.2 cm (series 2, image
