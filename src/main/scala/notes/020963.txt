Service: SURGERY

Allergies:

Attending:[**Known firstname 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatic head necrosis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Exploratory laparotomy.
2. Retroperitoneal exploration and drainage of abscess.
3. Open cholecystectomy.
4. Duodenostomy tube placement.
5. G-tube placement.
6. J-tube placement.
7.  Tracheostomy
8. Incision, drainage and debridement of right inguinal canal
and the suprapubic space.
9. Incision and drainage of scrotum.


History of Present Illness:
73M transferred from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for necrosis of pancreas
seen on CT s/p emobolization of pancreaticoduodenal artery 2
days ago for upper GI bleed.  He was in usual health 4 days ago
when he had two episodes of bright red blood per rectum with
associated light headedness, no CP or SOB.  Was seen in ED
and admitted to medicine service.  Tagged RBC showed possible
bleeding proximal transverse colon but EGD 2 days ago revealed
"welling up" of blood in 2nd portion of duodenum with no
identification of source.  IR was consulted and embolization of
the duodenal portion of the pancreaticoduodenal artery was
performed the same day [**2200-5-23**].  Patient has not had any
subsequent episodes of BRBPR.  CT today was significant for
ileus and low attenuation of head of pancreas worrisome for
ischemia/necrosis and thickening of wall of duodenum. Patient
was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and care.

During hospitalization patient received a total of 5 units PRBC
with 2 of those units being transfused overnight of [**5-24**].  He
had an NGT placed prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  Colonoscopy was
never performed to evaluate proximal transverse colon.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2200-5-26**] 4:17 AM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2200-5-29**] 2:01 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Large gas- and fluid-containing retroperitoneal collection
extending from the region of the second portion of the duodenum
and pancreatic head, along the right flank, through the right
inguinal canal into the right scrotum. The findings are
consistent with duodenal perforation, likely related to reported
recent embolization.
2. Necrosis of the pancreatic head, largely replaced by a gas-
and fluid- containing collection. No pancreatic ductal dilation.
3. 11-mm cystic lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas.
This could possibly relate to the patient's acute syndrome, as
in the case of focal pancreatic necrosis, versus a primary
cystic lesion of the pancreas or dilation of the uncinate
process duct. If this lesion is not resected, further followup
will be required after the patient's acute process has resolved.
4. Massive scrotal edema and right-sided hydrocele directly
extending from the retroperitoneal collection. The marked
enhancement about the periphery of the collection and marked
scrotal edema are consistent with inflammatory process.
5. Bilateral hypodense renal lesions, too small to characterize.
6. Probable gallbladder adenomyomatosis.
.
SCROTAL U.S.  [**2200-5-29**] 1:58 PM
TESTICULAR ULTRASOUND: Comparison was made with the CT scan
performed on the same day dated [**2200-5-29**]. Right testicle
measures 2.8 x 2.6 x 3.6 cm. Left testicle measures 2.8 x 2.2 x
3.5 cm. The vascularity to the testicles is preserved without
evidence of focal lesion. Echotexture of the testicles is
normal. Within the bilateral scrotum in extratesticular
location, there is markedly heterogeneous and echogenic complex
fluid, due to extension of the pancreatic fluid tracking down in
the retroperitoneum as seen on the CT study. The skin is
thickened; however, there is no evidence of subcutaneous air.
IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous complex material and fluid within the
scrotum bilaterally in extratesticular location, due to tracking
and accumulation of the pancreatic fluid seen on CT study.
Normal testicles with preserved flow without focal lesion. The
findings were discussed with the referring physician.
.
ECHO
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2200-6-1**] 10:23 AM
CONCLUSION:
1. Interval improvement in the patient's right flank
retroperitoneal collection, status post surgery. Multiple drains
are identified in situ. No evidence of intraperiotneal spillage
of contrast pd connection with the residual collection .
2. There has been dramatic interval worsening in the patient's
pulmonary status and consideration towards a formal chest CT to
further evaluate these is made. There is a wide differential
including pulmonary edema, infection and ARDS.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2200-6-5**] 4:24 AM
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
slight improvement. The extent of the left-sided pleural
effusion has decreased, the right lung has increased in
transparency. There are still moderate opacities at the right
lung base and extensive retrocardiac atelectasis. The size of
the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. Also unchanged are the
positions of the monitoring and support devices. There is no
evidence of newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2200-6-13**] 1:01 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of large amount of air and fluid within
the right scrotum, which extends into the right lower anterior
abdominal wall. A catheter is identified extending from the
right retroperitoneal flank into the right inguinal canal.
2. Splenic hypodensity and renal hypodensities, too small to
characterize.
3. Interval improvement in bilateral patchy opacities at the
lung bases.
4. Unchanged appearance of bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2200-6-25**] 3:51 PM
As compared to the previous radiograph, the intrathoracic tube
has been exchanged for a tracheal tube. The left-sided central
venous access line has been removed. Increase in extent of the
left-sided pleural effusion. Unchanged extent of the
retrocardiac atelectasis. Unchanged extent of moderate pulmonary
edema, there is no evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal
opacities suggestive of pneumonia.
