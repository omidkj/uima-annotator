Brief Hospital Course:
82 M with CLL, hypogammaglobulinemia, h/o astocytosis
"anaphylactoid" reactions presents with sore thorat, subjective
fever and hypotension found to have clostridium difficile. The
following issues were investigated during this hospitalization:
.
Anaphylaxis/Hypotension: Resolved. Most likely mastocytosis and
anaphylaxis given presentation. Initially on broad spectrum
antibiotics but later found to have clostridium difficile which
was likely trigger in this setting. He was started on PO Flagyl
with downtrending WBC, stable vital signs and improving clinical
appearance, allowing him to be called out to the medicine floor
where he was discharged the following day on enough Flagyl to
complete a 2 week course as well as a regimen of Zyrtec,
Prednisone and Ranitidine per the instructions of his allergist.
