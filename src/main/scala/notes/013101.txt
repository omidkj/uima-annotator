Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1620**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
78M with Parkinson's disease, CAD s/p CABG and multiple PCI's
with stents, CHF with EF 30%, osteoporosis, and history of
multiple falls who is being admitted to MICU for sepsis from
presumed urinary source. Patient with multiple falls in past,
the last 2 days prior to this admission felt to be mechanical
(tripped on shoe) with head laceration treated with staples. Pt
unsure if he loss consciousness during this but knows that he
hit his head. Denied LH, dizziness, CP, palps, SOB, tongue
biting, incontinence surrounding event. Head CT nml and C-spine
with T3 compression fracture, old. Patient was cleared in ED and
sent home. This a.m. he was getting OJ out of refrigerator and
lost balance, falling backwards. No vertigo, LOC, CP, SOB,
palps, LH, dizziness preceding event ('unsteady on feet'). He
called for help and was brought to the ED this a.m.

In ED had temp to 102.8, HR 118, BP 138/42. BP dropped
transiently to 92/60 but he was repositioned and BP increased to
115/73. Recieved 3L NS in ED, was pancultured, and was given
levofloxacin 500, vancomycin 1g, and flagyl 500 (for abd pain
and h/o diarrhea x 4 months), ASA, ticlid. CE's cycled and
monitored on telemetry. Patient and family do not want central
line placed. Also had inferolat ST depressions on EKG while
tachycardic, and cardiology was curbsided and felt they were
rate related.

Upon arrival to the floor he states that he is comfortable and
without pain. This a.m. patient noted dysuria and frequency, no
urgency. On ROS mouth is dry, he is fatigued, and he has been
having diarrhea x 4 months (W/U as outpt unrevealing - improved

CT of C-spine ([**2117-12-8**]):
There is a [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] anterior wedge compression fracture of the
T3 vertebral body. The presence of adjacent osteophytes raises
the possibility that the fracture is chronic, but this
observation requires clinical correlation.

CT Head ([**2117-12-8**]):
No intracranial hemorrhage, no fracture. 7mm rounded lymph node
in the right submental region.

CT Head ([**2117-12-10**]):
1. No definite acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Mild atrophy and left more than right basal ganglia chronic
lacunes, with some volume loss.
3. Chronic-appearing ethmoid inflammatory disease with extensive
opacification of bilateral ethmoid air cells, right more than
left.

CXR ([**2118-12-10**]):
Interstitial pulmonary edema.

Renal US ([**2117-12-13**]):
No renal stones or hydronephrosis on either side.

ECHO ([**2117-12-13**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and   cavity size are normal. There is [**Month/Day/Year 1192**]
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the basal 2/3rds of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments are mildly hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal with mild free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [**Month/Day/Year 1192**] (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [**Month/Day/Year **] [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen.  There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis:
Patient with SIRS based on tachycardia and fever with evidence
of end organ damage with lactate of 4.0, qualifying for sepsis.
Was not hypotensive.  CXR without evidence of infiltrate.  CT
scan did show sinusitis.  Overall, the source was presumed to be
urinary as had WBC on UA - urine culture did not grow any
organisms.

In the unit, the patient was treated with IVF.  HR and urine
output were followed.  Broad spectrum antibiotics were used
initially levofloxacin and vancomycin for urinary and nasal
pathogens.  Flagyl was started initially with d/c as there was
no evidence of aspiration or bowel pathogen.

The patient did well in the unit and was called out to the
floor.  Treatment was a planned 10 days of levaquin.

On the day of discharge, the patient had an episode of
diapheresis.  Oral temperature was 97 with a rectal temperature
of 100.  His finger stick was ~170 and an EKG showed no changes.
 Given that his WBC had increased slightly from the prior day
(12.3->14.8), blood and urine cultures were drawn.  At the time
of discharge, the patient felt well.

2. CAD:
In the setting of sepsis, the patient had an EKG with
inferolateral ST depressions with and a troponin that peaked at
1.6.  Cardiology saw the patient and felt this was demand as
opposed to an ACS.  As such, they did not feel that an acute
cath was needed.  The patient was placed on heparin and
integrillin on the 17th - the heparin was stopped two days later
and the integrillin was stopped the next day.  The patient was
followed by cardiology - cardiac cath was considered, but not
pursued.  Plan was for outpatient stress test once the patient
was impro
