Endotracheal intubation and extubation

History of Present Illness:
68 yo woman with Parkinson's s/p deep brain stimulator admitted
to ICU post-op [**2148-1-1**] from removal of hardware (L glenoid
component) placed during total shoulder arthroplasty in
[**2147-3-20**]. Post-op from shoulder surgery on [**2147-3-20**], the
patient had violent dyskinesia that led to dislocation of her
left shoulder. In fear of repeat episode of violent post-op
dyskinesia, transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] was requested to keep patient
intubated. Reason for transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] is to keep patient
intubated and sedated overnight with plan for slow wean from
sedation in the morning while assessing her level of dyskinesia.


Deep brain stimulator was deactivated prior to surgery. In the
OR patient was noted to have 350 mL estimated blood loss. She
received 1500 mL of crystalloid and had a urine output of 150
mL. Deep brain stimulator was reactivated in OR post-op by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] (neurology).

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]  resumed original DBS settings, states that she may
be tipped easily into encephalopathy and that dyskinesias could
resemble restlessness [**1-2**]. Extubated in afternoon [**1-3**], did
well. Minimal dyskinesia. Febrile to 100.3 with tachycardia, got
1L ivf bolus. [**1-4**] decreased hct, transfussed 2 units red
cells, NG lavage +, pink tinged, stool guaiac negative, GI
called, rec outpatient eval.

[**2148-1-1**]: Left Shoulder film: Probable persistent anterior
dislocation of the left humeral head prosthesis. Glenoid
component not visualized on this examination.

[**2148-1-2**]: Chest xray: In comparison with study of [**7-10**], there is
now an endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 7 cm above
the carina. Nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
Stimulator devices are in place. The cardiac silhouette is
slightly enlarged. Probable atelectatic changes at the left
base. However, in view of the new fever, the possibility of
supervening pneumonia can certainly not be excluded.

[**2148-1-3**]: Chest xray: Status post placement of a right-sided PICC
with the catheter terminating in the lower SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the OR on [**2148-1-1**] where she underwent
the above procedure without complications.  Pre-operatively, she
had a left supraclavicular block placed by anesthesia and had
GETA for the procedure.  Her deep brain stimulator was shut off
immediately after intubation in the OR by her neurologist, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  It was then turned back on immediately upon
completion of the procedure in the OR prior to transfer to the
ICU.

ICU COURSE:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the ICU intubated post-operatively in
order to monitor her closely for dyskinesias given her
post-operative course after her initial total shoulder
arthroplasty.  On POD#1, she spiked a fever to 102.5 and she was
started on Vanco, Levaquin, and Cefepime for broad coverage of a
possible early pneumonia.  She continued on the Levaquin, but
the Vanco and Cefepime were stopped on POD#2 once she was
afebrile and her CXR cleared.  She completed an 8-day course of
Levofloxacin.  A PICC line was placed for access on POD2.  Her
surgical incision remaiend clean, dry, and intact without
erythema or drainage.  The ICU team weaned to extubate while
monitoring her closely for any signs of overt dyskinesias.  She
was continued on her Parkinson's meds per her strict schedule
and did not miss a dose throughout the procedure or post-op. She
was extubated on POD#2.  On POD#3, her hematocrit was 25.9 and
she received 3u PRBCs. The ICU team did a gastric lavage whch
came back gastroccult positive and GI was consulted. GI
recommended careful monitoring with a PPI. Given that she showed
no signs of any active bleeding, she did not require an EGD.
Her hematocrit remained stable after transfusion.  She was
transitioned to a PO diet and her Parkinson's meds were
transitioned from NGT to PO once able to tolerate.  She was made
NWB on the LUE in a sling with a plan to wait on pendulum
exercises or ROM at least until follow-up.  She was discharged
from the ICU to rehab once stable.
