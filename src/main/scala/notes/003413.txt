Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 111059**] is a 43 y/o lady with a PMHx of type I DM x 7 yrs
with h/o multiple admissions for DKA due to noncompliance,
admitted with DKA. Her hospital course by problem is summarized
below.
.
#DKA : Patient has a history of type I DM and noncompliance,
with previous admissions for DKA.  She received 3.5L of NS in
the ED, 10u of regular insulin, and was placed on an insulin
gtt.  She was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for close monitoring
and management.  She had an arterial line placed to monitor her
blood pressure.  Her initial VBG showed a pH of 6.8, with an AG
of 36 on admission.  She was given large volume resuscitation
over the first 24 hours, received 10L of NS, which was
transitioned to D5 1/2NS once her glucose dropped under the 300s
range.  She was given 3 amps of bicarb, and received 1L of 3amps
of bicarb in D5W to help correct her acidosis.  Over the first
24 hours, her AG closed, and her hemodynamic instability
corrected.  She was eventually weaned off an insulin gtt and
placed on her home Insulin SS.  The etiology of her DKA remained
unclear but may have represented a prior viral gastroenteritis
with poor compliance with her insulin regimen.  Blood and urine
cx's  were sent which remained NGTD throughout her hospital stay
and her empiric Abx given on HD#1 were discontinued.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted to help with BS management. Pt was transitioned to her
previous Insulin SS and transferred to the regular medicine
floor for further management. She remained stable with good
glucose control and tolerating POs. She was discharged home on
her prior regimen with [**Last Name (un) **] followup.
.
# Leukocytosis:
Unclear etiology, likely due to severe stress response given
DKA, although can not rule out bacterial infection given
elevated WBC.  No definite source was identified; u/a (-) and
CXR (-) for consolidations.  Possible source may be intraoral
given poor dentition; no abscess seen on PEX.  Received empiric
dose of Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]/Flagyl in ED but these were not continued as
no source was ever isolated. Patient's WBC trended down with
appropriate rx of her DKA.
.
# ARF: Patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.5  which was
felt pre-renal from severe dehydration due to DKA as this
returned to her baseline of 0.9 after IVF hydration.
.
# Hypercholerolemia: Stable.  Lipitor continued.
.
# Pump:  Patient has a history of mild systolic and diastolic
dysfunction and is known to be noncompliant with medications.
Her beta blocker was held secondary to hypovolemia and her
clinical exam was closely followed to assure patient did not
become grossly fluid overloaded.  Once hemodynamically stable,
patient was restarted on her prior medications including ACEI.
.
# AG metabolic Acidosis: Admitted with an anion gap of 36, due
to DKA as above.  It resolved once the DKA was treated with IVF
and Insulin.
.
# F/E/N:  Patient was hydrated with normal saline IVF with
aggressive repletion of her electrolytes.
.
# PPx: Patient maintained on Hep SQ for DVT prophylaxis, PPI,
and bowel meds as needed.
.
# Access: Patient initially had a R femoral cordis placed in ED,
which was removed in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
