Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was found to have EKG with ST elevations in V3-V6 and II,
III, aVF to a lesser degree, concerning for anterior STEMI; CK
was 20,000, but neg CK-MB, index, trop. Pt received cath w/2
stents placed in LAD, hemodynamics were notable for elevated
wedge pressure indicating L heart failure so she was a/t CCU for
closer management.

Cath results:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
3. Successful stenting of the LAD.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this left-dominant circulation
revealed
single vessel CAD. The LMCA was free of angiograpic disease. The
LAD had
an ostial 80% lesion, followed by a 70% stenosis. The LCX had no
flow-limiting stenoses. The RCA was non-dominant and free of
disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics showed severely elevated right and left
heart
pressures and a reduced cardiac index.
3. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD with two 2.5 mm
Cypher
drug-eluting stents. Final angiography showed no residual
stenosis, no
apparent dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
HEMODYNAMICS:RA 18 RV 51/17 PA 51/27 PCW 30 PA sat 65% CO 2.44
CI 1.69

The patient was noted to be confused on arrival to the CCU and
it was not clear if this was new or not, though after discussion
with family it seems to be a worsening of a baseline confusion
that the patient has exhibited for the past 6 months or so.

1. Cardio

A. Coronaries--received stents as above to LAD; was started on
ASA, Plavix, Lipitor 80mg po qd though with difficulty as pt was
initially refusing to take all medications; she never missed a
dose of Plavix however.

B. Pump--fluid overloaded initially in CHF, diuresed with lasix
while in the CCU, echo performed that revealed EF 20-25%; pt was
started on metoprolol tid and captopril tid, but eventually
switched over to atenolol 100 mg PO QD, lisinopril 5.0 po qd
with adequate control of her BP and HR

C. Rhythm--NSR with occassional ST from agitation during the
overnight hours; not a candidate for ICD given DNR/DNI status
and narrow QRS; was initially not started on heparin or coumadin
because of history of falls, but then her PCP was emailed (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3142**] and he said that he would like her started on
anticoagulation, which she was prior to d/c with coumadin and
briding heparin drip (no initial bolus); she will need careful
monitoring given her mental status and history of falls
(including the one that got her into the hospital on this admit)

2. Pulm: pt presented with CHF/pulmonary edema, which responded
well to lasix diuresis; the pt did not require more than a nasal
canulla to keep her oxygenation adequate.  She was noted to have
evidence of COPD on her CXR so atrovent and ipratropium nebs
were prescribed with good effect. ?RUL infiltrate on CXR at OSH,
pt was started on Flagyl/Levaquin for coverage of asp pna.

3. ID: pt was noted to have elevated WBC count though she
remained afebrile; she came from the OSH with possible
aspiration pneumonia from a CXR read at the OSH that we did not
have access to at [**Hospital1 18**]. We started a 7d course of Levquin 250mg
po qd and Flagyl 500mg po tid for presumed asp pna; a CXR on
[**8-16**] showed clear pulm parenchyma. WBC trended down with the
antibiotics.

5. GI: the patient was noted to have difficulty eatting solid
foods when she arrived to the floor after being in the unit, so
a Speech and Swallow consult was sought that recommended thin
liquids and pureed foods. The patient had poor PO intake, denied
hunger or thirst, but was encouraged to eat.

6. GU: foley cath was removed once patient was transferred to
the floor; UA showed trace blood but otherwise negative

7. Heme: stable

8. Endo: SSI qid

9. Neuro: patient was unreliable historian; in speaking with her
son and daughters, it seems that she has had some mental status
decline over the last 6 months or so with worsening in the weeks
prior to her admission; the patient initially would not
cooperate enought to perform a detailed Neuro exam; she was sent
for a head CT which revealed a right lacunar infarct that was
old, no new CVA evidence; Geriatrics consultants felt that this
was likely a delirium on top of a baseline dementia,
