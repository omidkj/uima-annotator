Service: Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
woman who is status post a coiling of a left internal carotid
artery aneurysm in [**2140-4-7**], after which she had
complaints of severe occipital headache and left eye ptosis.
She states that she continues to have headaches frequently
and denied a period of significant improvement.  Moreover,
now the headaches are localized in the left ocular region
radiating down the neck and toward the occipital region.  She
states that the headaches are so severe that she now takes
Percocet for the pain.  She notes nothing else that relieves
the headaches.  She also notes no particular inciting stimuli
for the headaches.  She denies associated visual changes,
numbness, weakness, or difficulty speaking.  She denies any
recent illness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Coiling of the left internal
carotid artery aneurysm in [**2140-4-7**].  2. Hypothyroidism.  3.
Coronary artery disease.  4. Congestive heart failure.  5.
Hypertension.  6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  7.
Status post hysterectomy.  8. Status post hemorrhoidectomy.
9. Status post pacemaker placement.  10. Status post
depression.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature was 96, blood pressure
132/68, pulse 75, respiratory rate 20, saturations 99% on
room air.  In general she was an elderly woman in no acute
distress who appeared younger than her stated age with left
eye ptosis.

Neurologically she was awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Speech
was fluent.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light,
2 mm down to 1 mm.  Extraocular movements were full.  She did
have a left ptosis.  Spacial sensation was intact.  Her face
was symmetric.  Tongue was midline.  Her muscle tone was
full.  Her strength was 4+ in the biceps on the right, 4+ in
the triceps bilaterally, and [**4-11**] in all other muscle groups.
Her deep tendon reflexes were 2+ throughout.  Sensation was
symmetric to light touch and temperature sensation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and hydrated for
angiogram, which she had on [**2140-6-17**].  The procedure
consisted of an additional coil embolization placement of the
residual aneurysm with the use of a Neuroform stent to cover the
neck. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
There were no intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively
the patient has had no headache, no visual changes, no
difficulty with moving extremities.  She continued to have
persistent left ptosis, was awake, alert and oriented x 3,
moving all extremities with good strength.  She was monitored
in the intensive care unit postoperatively.  She remained
neurologically intact with persistent left ptosis and was
transferred to the regular floor on postoperative day one.
Her vital signs were stable.  She has been afebrile.  She did
have an episode on [**2140-6-20**] of respiratory distress with
decreased saturations.  She had a chest x-ray which showed
some evidence of congestive heart failure.  She was given
some Lasix and nebulizer treatments and some chest physical
therapy and her respiratory status improved greatly.  She is
now back at her baseline respiratory status, which is stable.

She was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and
found to require a short rehabilitation stay prior to
discharge to home.  She will continue on Plavix and aspirin
and will be evaluated with repeat angiogram in two months.
Her vital signs are stable.  She has been afebrile and
without headache.  Her motor strength in all of her
extremities is [**4-11**].  She has no drift and currently no
headache.
