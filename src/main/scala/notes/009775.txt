Chief Complaint:
chest pain, DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yoF with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, prior admissions for
pneumonia here with shortness of breath/DOE x1 week. Patient was
in her usual state of health until 1 week ago when her BP was
elevated. She went to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who started her on
hydralazine. Then, starting a few days ago, she began to notice
centrally located chest pain as well as dyspnea with minimal
exertion (walking from elevator to her apartment) which would
normally not be a problem for her. Over the last 2 days her
chest pain remained with her at rest and with exertion. She had
been taking SL NTGs at home w/o significant change in her CP.
She denied SOB at rest but had persistent dyspnea w/ minimal
exertion. Today, as her symptoms persisted, she presented to the
ED.

In the ED, 97.4, 183/72, 83, 20, 100% NRB.  On exam, chest pain
reproducible and atypical. CXR was unremarkable. However, ECG
with lateral ST depressions. Given NTGx1 with no effect. Aspirin
given as well as morphine. ECG repeated w/ second set of CEs. ST
depressions then diffuse w/ 2mm STD in precordial leads and some
elevation in AVR. With ECG changes, patient received plavix
600mg, heparin gtt, and nitro gtt. She also received 1 dose of
mucomyst w/ expectation of cath. CEs negative x2.  She became
chest pain free in the ED w/ nitro and heparin gtt.

Upon arrival to the floor, she continues to be chest pain free.
On review of systems,  she denies any recent fever or chills.
She does note some recent wheezing which she attributes to a
[**Male First Name (un) 20181**] rug in her apartment. Denies any bowel or bladder
symptoms.

ECG [**2141-2-27**]: NSR @ 70. Nl axis and intervals. Inferior TW
flattening w/ <[**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in II, aVF. 1 mm STD w/ TWI
in V5-6.

ECG [**2141-2-26**] 17:23: NSR@90. Nl axis and intervals. TWI in lateral
leads c/w strain pattern of LVH. 1-2mm ST depressions in V4-6. [**Street Address(2) 13234**] depression in II. Compared to prior [**2139-5-6**], ST changes
are new.

CXR [**2141-2-26**]:
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The left CPA is not
included in this study.  The upper lungs are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of CHF or acute cardiopulmonary
process.

CARDIAC CATH [**3-1**]:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe
three vessel disease. The LMCA was normal. The LAD had 60-70%
tubular
diffuse disease. The LCX had 80% tubular diffuse disease. The
RCA had
80% tubular diffuse disease.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic arterial
pressures
during the case with an SBP of 139 mm Hg.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. After the diagnostic procedure, the patient complained of
throat and
eye itching. She subsequently developed facial erythema plethora
with
whole body pruritus and developed angioedema of the tongue and
had
difficulty speaking and breathing consistent with anaphylaxis.
Arterial
pressure rose to 220 mm Hg systolic. The patient was given
benadryl, IV
solumedrol, nitro gtt and IC nitro, albuterol nebulizers,
pepcid, 100 mg
IV lasix and epinephrine 0.3 mg SC x 1 with close respiratory
monitoring. Anesthesia was present but intubation was not
necessary and
the patient was stabilized and transferred to the CCU for closer

monitoring.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Anaphylaxis to IV contrast.

Brief Hospital Course:
CAD:  The patient presented with unstable angina, she had ST
depressions in her L anterior precordial leads which were 2mm
depressions and seemed significant.  She ruled out for MI.  She
was started on aspirin, plavix, statin, heparin, and a beta
blocker.  She underwent a cardiac cathterization which revealed
severe calcified 3 vessel disease and no intervention was made.
Decision was made for medical management.  Started on Toprol
200mg daily, Losartan increased to 100mg daily.  Norvasc 5mg
daily continued, ASA 325mg daily, Plavix 75mg daily, Lipitor
80mg daily, hydralazine 25mg po tid.  She should continue on
these medications as an outpatient.
