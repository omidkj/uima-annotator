History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 81858**] is a 61M with DM who presented to an OSH with right
neck and L forearm pain. He describes the pain as a dull ache
that started while walking and did not resolve until he was
treated at the OSH. He denies any history of similar neck and
arm pain. He reports mild shortness of breath with pain but
denies any other associated symptoms such as diaphoresis,
nausea, palpitations, or dizziness. In the OSH his EKG
reportedly showed inferolateral ST depression and initial
troponin I was 0.35. He was given nitroglycerin SL, fentanyl,
and then started on nitroglycerin and heparin drips. He also
received plavix 300mg. Pt was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management and cardiac catheterization.

Pt initially went to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service where his EKG changes
resolved and he was chest pain free and was planned for cath in
AM. Pt does report retroactively that he had some chest pain
overnight that he did not report and AM cardiac enzymes
continued to trend up: CK 1579->1550, Trop 1.4->3.3.

In the cath lab, pt had venous and arterial sheath placed,
received 381ml dye, had SBPs in the 70s requiring 1200ml IVF,
dopamine drip and 1mg atropine. He also received heparin,
integrillin. Pt reported pain with placement of stents (3BMS to
OM2 and 2BMS to midLAD).

On presentation to [**Name (NI) 42137**], pt was off pressors and chest pain
free.

[**10-18**] ECHO: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the
inferolateral wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 55 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with focal
regional dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Dilated ascending aorta.

CATH [**10-17**]: No formal results

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old smoker without recent medical following, presented
to OSH with arm pain and found to have NSTEMI. Pt transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] and is now s/p cath where he was found to have a total
occlusion requiring 2 BMS to OM2 and 2BMS to mid LAD.

# NSEMI - On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] pt was pain free with minimal STD
on EKG. His cardiac enzymes continued to [**Last Name (un) **] up and peaked at
CK of 2550 and Trop 3.3 on [**10-17**]. That morning pt underwent
catheterization and found to have total occlusion of the OM2 and
mid LAB with multiple bare metal stents placed in both. Pt was
medically managed with aspirin, plavix, statin, heparin gtt,
integrillin gtt. Beta blocker was initially held for hypotension
and started prior to discharge. Pt will also need addition of
ace inhibitor.
- Continue Toprol XL 25mg daily
- Continue Simvastatin 80mg daily
- Continue ASA daily

# DMt2: Pt not medically managed as outpt. His HbA1c was
measured for risk stratification and found to be 6.9. His blood
sugars were monitored and treated with insulin sliding scale. At
discharge pt was asked to follow up with [**Last Name (un) **] diabetes clinic.


# Tobacco abuse: Pt was given nicotine patch for symptomatic
control and counseled re importance of smoking cessation for
both himself and family.
