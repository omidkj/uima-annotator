Central line placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 year-old female with a history of Alzheimer's
dementia, hypothyroidism, htn, and recent hospitalization for
PNA who presents from her nursing home with persistent
leukocytosis after completing a course of levo/flagyl for recent
PNA and hypotension to he 70's today.

She had a recent admission from [**2160-1-3**] to [**2160-1-8**] for mental
status change and pneumonia.  She was discharged to complete a
course of levaquin which finished on [**1-9**].  A week after
discharge she began to have fevers and her WBC was found to be
26.  She was started on levo/flagyl with improvement of her WBC
to 13.  Her course of levo/flagyl was completed on [**1-23**] vs
continued (conflicting reports in the signout from the nursing
home).  Since then she has had low grade fevers and became
hypotensive to the 70's to 90's today.  C.diff negative per
nursing home testing.  Antihypertensives have been held.  Was
restarted back on levo and flagyl prior to admission.

In the ED, her inital VS were: T 96.5  BP 90/53  HR 106  RR 18
Sat 100% on RA.  Her lowest BP recorded in the ED were in the
high 80's.  She was given 2 L of NS.  A CXR showed a RLL
consolidation.  She was started on vanc and zosyn broad spectrum
coverage.

ROS: The patient is unable to provide ROS (she admits and denies
symptoms, but her daughter states her answers are not accurate).
 Her daughter states that she had had a cough for the past few
days and that many patients in the nursing home have had a
similar cough.  Per her daughter has not had diarrhea.

ECG: Atrial fibrillation at 95 bpm, nl axis, no STE or STD.

Imaging:
CXR:  RLL infiltrate present



Brief Hospital Course:
# Septic Shock/Aspiration PNA: The patient met SIRS criteria
with leukocytosis and tachycardia in the ED.  Likely source is
pulmonary given the infiltrates seen on CXR.  Also with a
slightly positive UA.  Aggressively fluid recussiated, treated
with vancomycin (dosed by level) and zosyn.  Cultures were
negative with the exception of a single blood cx on [**1-26**] that
showed VRE.  Flu negative, urinary legionella negative.  The
night of admission a central line was placed and her CVP was
found to range from [**7-4**].  She was given additional IVF and then
started on levophed for low MAPs even with CVP of [**8-4**]. This was
weaned off within a day, but on [**1-26**] was seen to aspirate during
lunch and later became hypotenisve to the 80??????s with decreased
UOP.  IVF had minimal impact on her SBP so levophed was
restarted.  It was turned off on [**2160-1-28**] and has remained off.
She was called out to the floor on [**1-29**] but was hypoxic on
arrival, possibly secondary to mucous plugging versus
aspiration.  She returned to the floor later that day but was
satting well on 4L on arrival.  The results of the
speech/swallow study (trace to mild aspiration) were discussed
with her family, and they agreed that she was 1) OK to eat, 2)
would not return to the ICU, and 3) should be made comfortable
were she to have any further events of respiratory distress. She
continued to improve to time of discharge

Of note the patient was to be discharged on [**2159-1-31**], but just
prior to leaving pulled her PICC line. On discharge she had a
repeat PICC placed by IR. Unfortunately this too was pulled
prior to discharge.

# Acute on chronic renal failure:  The patient's Cr in the ED
was eleavated to 3.7 (baseline Cr of 1.1 to 1.3). Likely
prerenal with a FeNa of 0.2% or intrarenal from hypoperfusion
leading to ATN.  UA was moderately positive with 3-5 WBC, few
back, and small leuk.  Trended down to baseline.  Medications
renally dosed, nephrotoxins avoided.

# Atrial fibrillation: The patient was noted to be in a.fib on
her ED EKG which is new per her cardiologist. Last TTE in '[**55**]
showed normal systolic function, mild pulm art systolic htn, and
slightly dilated right atrium.  Monitored on tele.  TSH WNL, two
sets of cardiac enzymes were negative.  Did not treat medically
initially given her hypotension.  Her outpatient cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw her and recommended starting a heparin gtt,
however this was dc'ed due to Hct drop and guiac positive
stools.  She was started on low dose metoprolol for rate control
when her BP stabilized.

# Acute Blood Loss Anemia due to GI bleeding NOS: The patient
has a baseline Hct in the low to mid 30's.  In the ED her Hct
was 28.6 and her MCV was 85.  Had been recently hospitalized and
now presents with sepsis so likely had marrow suppression from
acute infection.  She also had guaiac positive stools throughout
her hospitalization.  Her Hct dropped actutely from 25 to 21 in
the setting of initiating heparin for her a. fib, so this was
discontinued.  She was not transfused because her Hct
stabilized.

# Alzheimer's Dementia:  The patient has a history of
chronically worsening dementia.
She was initially continued on her home regimen of donepezil,
memantine, and risperdone.  Zxyrexa given prn for agitation.
These were held while she was kept NPO but restarted afterward.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine.

# Hyperparathyroidism: The patient is s/p parathyroid resection.
Continued Ca and Vit D until she was made NPO, and they
restarted them afterward.

# FEN:  Speech and swallow saw her and she was initally given a
diet per their recs, however on [**1-26**] she was seen to aspirate at
lunch so she was made NPO.  Per discussion with the daughter she
did not want a NGT placed.  Video swallow study s
