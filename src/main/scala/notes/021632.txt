ADMISSION DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hyperkalemia.
2.  Ventricular tachycardia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 66-year-old
ischemic cardiomyopathy, complete heart block, status post
VVI pacemaker, ventricular tachycardia, status post
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in [**2110-7-9**] who
presented to [**Hospital3 17310**] with shortness of
breath and found to be in wide complex tachycardia with a
rate of 120, given beta blocker and sent to [**Hospital1 346**].
On the way, he received amiodarone 150 mg times one
intravenously and magnesium sulfate.  The patient's digoxin
level was 2.9, and potassium was 6.  He was given insulin to
correct his high potassium in the Emergency Department with a
repeat potassium of 4.9 and was evaluated by
Electrophysiology and pacemaker adjusted and now paced at 60.
Systolic blood pressure as low as 40/palp, went to higher
rates of ventricular tachycardia to 140 to 150.  The patient
was conscious throughout, systolic blood pressure of 110/60
once paced at 60.  Digibind given for increased digoxin level
of 2.9.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in [**2098**].
2.  Complete heart block from myocardial infarction; received
VVI and pacemaker, later replaced with dual chamber pacer/ICD.
3.  Cardiac arrest, ventricular tachycardia; received
amiodarone.
4.  Recurrent ventricular tachycardia in [**2110**], received
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
5.  Mmalnutrition.

ALLERGIES:  VANCOMYCIN.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.,
captopril 18.75 p.o. t.i.d., Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.,
Coreg 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d., Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.,
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 160 mg p.o. q.d.,
digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A 40-pack-year history of smoking.  No
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, cerebrovascular
accident, coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
afebrile, heart rate of 60, blood pressure of 100/60,
breathing at 14, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air.  In
general, he was a well-appearing, thin, white male in no
apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
revealed sclerae were clear.  Cardiovascular revealed second
heart sound and second heart sound, regular.  No murmur.
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen
with positive bowel sounds, soft, and nontender.  Extremities
were thin.  No lower extremity edema.  Neurologically, he was
alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through
XII were intact.  Strength was [**5-13**] throughout.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 16.1, hematocrit of 47.2, platelets of 328.  PTT
was 37.5, INR was 4.  Sodium of 132, potassium of 6, chloride
of 93, bicarbonate of 23, blood urea nitrogen of 58,
creatinine of 1.9.  A repeat potassium
after insulin was 4.9.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed previous wide
complex tachycardia at 110, QRS was -77, later AV paced
at 60.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was given digoxin.  His digoxin
level was less than 0.3 after Digibind was administered.  The
patient was also given Kayexalate.  The patient was ablated
by the Electrophysiology Service and tolerated this procedure
well.  He was sent transiently to the Coronary Care Unit for
management and observation.  The patient's creatinine was 1.9
on admission.  It decreased to 1.3 with hydration.  The
patient's Coumadin was initially 4.  He was given vitamin K,
and his Coumadin was held over the weekend before his
pacemaker was adjusted and the ablation was performed.  Later
his Coumadin was reloaded at 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.

The patient did well after his VT ablation and was observed
while he was reloaded on his Coumadin.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged home on [**2114-5-31**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  (He had the same discharge diagnoses as
his admission diagnoses).
1.  Hyperkalemia.
2.  Ventricular tachycardia.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], in two to three weeks at
[**Hospital3 17310**] and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**] at [**Hospital1 1444**] in one month.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Captopril 12.5 p.o. t.i.d.
3.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.o.d.
5.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
6.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. (until INR is
therapeutic).

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable
condition.
