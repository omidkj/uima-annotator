History of Present Illness:
History could not be obtained per pt. Per records:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5655**] is an 84 yo F with recently diagnosed metastatic
ovarian CA thought not to be a chemo candidate, with recent
admission [**Date range (1) 62824**] during which she was admitted for SOB, had 2
abdominal paracenteses, one of which showed adenocarcinoma via
peritoineal fluid culture c/w ovarian origin.  She also had an
IVC filter placed for a VQ scan which was intermediate
probabillity for PE.  Anticoagulation was not started [**3-2**] head
CT c/w possible metastatic disease and overall poor performance
status, however brain MRI showed no metastatic disease.
Palliative onc was consulted during that admission with the
patient and her son deciding that chemo that was aggressive
enough to shrink her tumor would not be tolerated by the pt
given her poor functional status and they thought palliative
care would be most appropriate.  She was planned for a
peritoneal portacath, but this was not done [**3-2**] logistical
problems for the [**Name (NI) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (to which she was being
discharged).
.
Additionally she had ARF with Cr up to 2.8, which resolved with
fluid boluses, however there remains concern about possible
tumor infiltration into the bladder.  MR urogram was not
revealing in this regard and was consistent with metastic
ovarian ca.  She was discharged to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], however in
discharge summary it states that code status was attempted to be
discussed several times and the patient was unwilling to
discuss, rendering her full code on discharge to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
for hospice.
.
Today she was seen by her family and was not ready to be DNR.
She wanted other interventions, including peritoneal cath for
ascites. She was noted to be hypotensive to 73/37 at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and no urine output was noted since her arrival there on
[**5-5**]. Her foley was flushed and was patent. Her bladder scan was
negative, and her abdominal girth over 2 days grew two inches.
She was sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER for further evaluation.
.
In the ER she received 4L of NS and urinated 75cc.  She was
given levo/flagyl and vanco and was started on peripheral dopa
until a RIJ could be placed, and then was started on levophed
drip and quickly weaned off dopamine. Initial temp was 99.2 and
BP was 89/45. Her family tried to convince her to be CMO per ED
documentation,  however she wanted to be full code, thus she was
transferred to the ICU.


Past Medical History:
1) ovarian cancer, likely metastatic as above
2) D2M: Diagnosed [**2126**], last A1C 6.6. On glyburide 2.5mg PO
3) HTN: On metoprolol, amlodipine, valsartan, and HCTZ


Social History:
Originally from Barbados. Lives at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] but previously
lived with her son. [**Name (NI) **] report neg tobacco, neg EtOH.  Pt has
never had pap smear, mammogram, or colonoscopy.


Family History:
No known family history of heart disease or cancer. Has son with

DM2.

[**2130-5-8**] Renal US:
FINDINGS: Left kidney measures 8.4 cm. The right kidney measures
8.9 cm. Again seen is a rounded hypoechoic structure within the
left kidney measuring approximately 1.3 cm in greatest
dimension. Allowing for technical differences, no significant
change is seen within the cyst compared to prior study. There is
no evidence of hydronephrosis or stones. Again noted is free
fluid within the abdomen.

IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior study. No evidence
of hydronephrosis or obstruction. Unchanged cyst within the left
kidney. Ascites.
*
[**2130-5-12**]
Chest AP
AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: A right internal jugular central
catheter remains with tip at the level of the junction of the
SVC with right atrium. Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours
are not changed given differences in patient position. There is
prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with volume
overload. There is atelectasis at the left base and a small
right pleural effusion. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Volume overload. Left basilar atelectasis and small
right pleural effusion
*
ECG [**2130-5-12**]
Sinus tachycardia with frequent atrial ectopy. Technically
limited study.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2130-5-10**] the rate has
increased and frequent
atrial ectopy has appeared. Possible prior inferior myocardial
infarction.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo woman with advanced metastatic ovarian CA who initially
presented on [**2130-5-7**] in septic shock, admitted to MICU for
hypotension/sepsis, transferred to the floor  on [**2130-5-26**] with
acute renal failure.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypotension and possible
sepsis. She was started on a ten day course of ceftriaxone and
was initially on Levophed but was weaned off of pressors. Renal
US was performed to evaluate oliguria and was negative for
hydronephrosis. She was stabilized overnight and transferred to
the floor the next day. Repeat paracentesis performed on [**5-17**]
demonstrated malignant cells, and given the advanced stage of
her ovarian cancer and her performance status, she was not a
candidate for palliative chemotherapy. While in the ICU, Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] of Palliative Care met with her, and tried to re-address
her goals of care and code status. Patient was full code when
transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor she continued to be followed by the palliative care
consult service. She continued to be oliguric. Urine
electrolytes were sent and were consistent with a prerenal
azotemia. She was hydrated initially with crystalloid, and
subsequently with blood, but with no response. Her creatinine
continued to rise. A urine sediment was significant for muddy
brown casts. Her worsening renal failure was thought more likely
to represent ATN from her presenting hypotension.
.
Her creatinine continued to rise and urine output remained low.
Concurrently the patient's anasarca, which was attributed to her
ovarian cancer and peritoneal seeding, worsened. Gentle diuresis
was attempted , however, given her renal failure and tenuous
blood pressure, the patient remained volume overloaded.  When
transferred from the unit to the floor patient's mental status
was noted to be altered. Head MRI was negati
