Admission Date:  [**2104-2-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2104-3-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2046-3-16**]       Sex:  M

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY/GREEN

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 57 year old man
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which has rendered him
ventilator dependent and requiring chronic care.  He has a
gastric tube which is used for tube feedings.  He can only
communicate through a series of eye blinks.  He was admitted
to the Medical service on [**2104-2-27**], with a lower
gastrointestinal bleed.  He had required a transfusion of six
units of blood over the four months beginning in the year
[**2103**].  While on the Medical service, he was prepared for
colonoscopy.  Colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated mass at 20
centimeters in the sigmoid colon.  Biopsies would later prove
to be adenocarcinoma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ventilator dependent.
2.  Pulmonary embolus, [**2103-12-15**].
3.  Placement of inferior vena cava filter following
pulmonary embolus.
4.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed.
5.  Occasional tachyarrhythmias which are self resolving.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Depression.
8.  Status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

Although the patient suffers from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, he is quite capable of making his own medical
decisions and does so with the help of his brother, [**Name (NI) **],
who is quite involved.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Prevacid 30 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Senna two tablets p.o. twice a day.
4.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4hours p.r.n.
5.  Dulcolax one per rectum once daily p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of discharge revealed the
patient to be afebrile with a heart rate of 80 and a blood
pressure of 140/80.  He is on a ventilator with the following
settings:  Respiratory rate 12, tidal volume 550, FIO2 30%,
PEEP 5.  The patient has a gastrostomy tube and is receiving
Promote with fiber tube feeds at a goal rate of 70cc per
hour.  On neurologic examination, the patient is atrophic and
has no motor tone.  He is capable of moving his eyes and
communicates by eye blinking.  He is competent and capable of
making his own medical decision making but often does so with
the help of his family.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The heart is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1
and S2.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, nontender.  His
staples in the wound can be taken out one week postdischarge.
His wound is healing quite well and his stoma is functioning
well.  The mucosa of the stoma is well appearing.
Extremities - no edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior
tibial pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.0, hematocrit
29.0, platelet count 470,000.  Chem7 revealed sodium 141,
potassium 4.0, chloride 111, CO2 21, blood urea nitrogen 8,
creatinine 0.2, blood sugar 121, calcium 7.9, magnesium 1.4,
phosphorus 3.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the adenocarcinoma complicated by
bleeding, the family and the patient decided to proceed with
surgery.  Two nights prior to the operation, he had a
nonsustained run of ventricular tachycardia, 22 beats in
length.  Cardiology evaluated the patient and recommended no
further workup.  His only other cardiac rhythm abnormality
was a short run of atrial bigeminy on postoperative day
number six which was also self limited.

On [**2104-3-7**], the patient was taken to the operating room
after a bowel prep and underwent a low anterior resection,
permanent end colostomy.  Preoperatively, a Foley catheter
could not be placed secondary to urethral strictures.
Urology service placed a suprapubic tube preoperatively in
the operating room.  The patient received 24 hours of
perioperative antibiotics.  His remaining postoperative
course was unremarkable.  He was started on tube feeds three
days postoperatively and slowly advanced to a goal rate of
70cc per hour.  His wound looked swell and there was no
evidence of a wound infection.  His stoma began to function
on postoperative day number six and he will require a bowel
regimen to keep his colon empty.  We have suggested
discharging him on Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day, Senna two
tablets p.o. twice a day and p.r.n. Lactulose.  This regimen
may be adjusted to effect as needed.  He has been on a
ventilator for several years and his discharge ventilator
settings were a respiratory rate of 12, tidal volume 550,
FIO2 30%, and PEEP 5.  His staples should be discontinued in
one week.  He had a negative urinalysis on the day of
discharge.  He will be at risk for developing urinary tract
infection and, if he develops a fever, this should be
considered.  We recommend follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] in two
weeks.  Please call his office for an appointment, telephone
number is supplied on page one.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous twice a day.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Prevacid 30 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Senna two tablets p.o. twice a day.
5.  Magnesium Oxide 400 mg p.o. once daily times one week.
6.  Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q4hours p.r.n. If this is not
adequate for pain control, then one could consider Percocet
or Roxicet Elixir 5 to 10cc p.o. q6hours p.r.n.  However, he
seems to be doing quite well with the Tylenol at this time.
7.  Lactulose 30cc p.o. twice a day p.r.n.
8.  Albuterol two to four puffs q4hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Colorectal cancer.
2.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, chronic ventilator
dependence.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Urinary retention.
5.  Lower gastrointestinal bleed.
6.  Status post lower anterior resection and suprapubic tube
placement.
7.  Depression.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The instructions are detailed on
page one and in the text of this discharge summary.  In
short, please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 1745**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 49516**], to
make an appointment for approximately two weeks from now for
follow-up.  The staples should be discontinued at the
rehabilitation facility one week from now.  His tube feeds
presenting are Promote with fiber at a goal rate of 70cc per
hour.  His ventilator settings are respiratory rate 12, tidal
volume 550, FIO2 30% and PEEP 5.  He will require standard
colostomy care.
