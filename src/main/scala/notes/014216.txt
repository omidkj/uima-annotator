History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 88363**] is a 55 year old female with a PMH significant for
HTN admitted for salicylate overdose. The patient was found this
morning by a friend to be confused and agitated with associated
tachypnea and tremors. She was brought to an urgent care clinic
in [**Hospital1 **], and immediately sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of a
stroke.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 98.1 114/64 85 24 100%4lnc.  She was
reported to have been feeling unwell for the past week, for
which she had been taking daily doses of aspirin.  She denies
taking any other drugs or alchohol. She was found to have a
respiratory alkalosis with anion-gap metabolic acidosis and an
elevated ASA level. She received a 150 meq bolus of bicarb, and
had a RIJ placed and was started on levophed for hypotension
with a SBP 80s. She was then admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further
management.
.
Currently, the patient is confused, but denies any CP/SOB or HA
but endorses tinnitus.

ADMISSION:
VS: 96.8 72 108/75 (0.18 lecophed) 16 100%2Lnc
Gen: Confused
HEENT: pupils 3->2mm reactive.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2138-1-1**]): Mild blunting of right costophrenic angle. RIJ
ending at cavoatrial junction.
.
CXR ([**2138-1-3**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-1**], the central
catheter has been removed and the patient has taken a better
inspiration. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is again
seen. There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
with mild fullness of pulmonary vessels that could reflect some
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Some opacification at the
bases most likely represents atelectasis, though in the
appropriate clinical setting the possibility of pneumonia cannot
be definitely excluded.
.
CXR ([**2138-1-6**]):
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-3**], there is little
overall
change. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
prominence of
interstitial markings consistent with increased pulmonary venous
pressure.
Bibasilar atelectasis is again seen, though in the appropriate
clinical
situation, the possibility of pneumonia would have to be
considered.

ECG: Sinus with 1:1 conduction. NA-NI. LAA. No acute ST-T wave
changes.
.
Head CT-FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage,
edema, mass effect, or large vessel territorial infarction. The
grey-white matter differentiation is well preserved. The
ventricles and sulci appear normal in size and configuration.
There are no fractures. The visualized portions of the paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 88363**] is a 55 year old female with a PMH significant for
HTN admitted for salicylate overdose.  The patient was treated
with a bicarbonate drip and was given charcoal.  Her aspirin
level decreased and her mental status improved.  The remainder
of her hospital course will be summarized below by problem.
.
#. Salicylate overdose: Patient presented with respiratory
alkalosis and anion-gap metabolic acidosis, tinnitus, and
elevatd salicylate level >50 consisetn with salicylate overdose,
which was complicated by distributive physiology causing
hypotension requiring pressor support.  She was also
coagulopathic at the time of her admission. She was treated with
a bicarb drip, and her ASA level came down. After her bicarb
drip was stopped, her repeat salicylate level further decreased
to 16.4. Her mental status improved and returned to baseline,
and she states that she had been taking [**2-27**]
