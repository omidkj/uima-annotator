Brief Hospital Course:
64 year-old man with cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery
disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure with EF 40%, and
seizure disorder presenting with cough, fevers, and
consolidations on chest x-ray consistent with pneumonia.
.
1.  Pneumonia: Chest x-ray from admission showed right middle
and lower lobe consolidations.  His oxygen saturations remained
above 92% on room air.  He was monitored in the intensive care
unit overnight and transferred to a general medical floor the
morning after admission.  He was started on vancomycin and
ampicillin-sulbactam to complete a two-week course for
hospital-acquired versus aspiration pneumonia.  A PICC line was
placed [**2199-10-23**] for intravenous access to complete the course of
antibiotics, ending [**2199-11-4**].
.
2. Hypernatremia: Asymptomatic and due to free water depletion.
His free water flushes were increased to 400 cc q4h with
improvement in sodium.  His sodium should be monitored
intermittently and his free water flushes should be adjusted
accordingly for hypernatremia.
.
3. Question urinary tract infection from nursing home: The
patient was on nitrofurantoin on admission, and it is unclear
whether this was for treatment or prophylaxis of urinary tract
infection.  This was discontinued when the above antibiotics
were started for pneumonia.  He can restart nitrofurantoin if
this was being given for prophylaxis when the course of
vancomycin and unasyn is complete.
.
4. Mental status: It was believed that the patient was delirious
on admission, however, after discussion with the patient's wife
and the nursing home his mental status was thought to be at
baseline.  He was treated for pneumonia as above.  He was
frequently redirected.
.
5. History of nonacloholic steatohepatitis/cirrhosis: The
patient is status post TIPS.  He is not [**Month/Day/Year **] candidate
currently due to his multiple comorbiditis. His MELD score was 5
on admission.  He was continued on rifamixin and lactulose.
.
6. Chronic systolic congestive heart failure: EF is 40%.  His
metoprolol was continued during admission.  The patient was
hypovolemic on admission and lasix was held.  Lasix was
restarted prior to discharge.
.
7. Seizure disorder:  No active issues.  The patient was
continued on keppra, topomax and zonisamide.  There was initial
confusion regarding his dose of keppra, and the patient was
initially given 2250 mg on admission, however, this was
subsequently changed to his home dose of 500 mg twice daily.
.
8. Type 2 diabetes: No active issues.  The patient was continued
on glargine 100 units twice daily as per his outpatient regimen.
 He received humalog sliding scale insulin as needed.
.
9. Coronary artery disease: No active issues.  The patient was
continued on metoprolol.  He is not on aspirin or statin at
baseline, likely due to his liver disease, and this can be
readdressed as an outpatient.

10. Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on his outpatietn
dose of levothyroxine 400 mcg daily.  During admission, his T4
was elevated to 1.9 with normal TSH.  His laboratories should be
checked after resolution of this acute illness and his dose of
levothyroxine adjusted accordingly.
.
11. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient was followed by the
[**Month/Day/Year **] care nurse.
.
12. Pancytopenia: His blood counts were at baseline during
admission.  His pancytopenia is believed secondary to liver
disease.  This should be monitored intermittently.
