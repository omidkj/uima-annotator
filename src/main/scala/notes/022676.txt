Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 58 y.o male with h/o DM, htn,
hypercholesterolemia, with known 3VD per cath in [**2114**] where pt
had 95% mid RCA stenosis, 70% Lcx, 60% LAD and 40% L main with
global hypokinesis with EF = 29%. (CI was wnl and PCWP = 16) who
has been medically managed. During the last 18 weekjs he has
noted changes in his chronic cough and is s/p treatment for
GERD, and asthma without relief. In the last [**3-6**] dys the patient
complained of anxiety with severe cough.  The patient reported
having an anxiety attack at 2:00 am amd felt SOB. Patient took
extra prn klonopin then went to PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] PCP's office the patient
was noted to be diaphoretic,cyanotic, w O2 sat = 80%RA and 98%
on 8L face mask. EKG at PCP's revealed old LBB and HR = 95 w/o
CP. Pt given ASA, lopressor, 5mg IV by EMS and brought to ER. No
reported episodes of CP, palpitations, or tachycardia. In ER pt
was on 82% 8 L FM with RR = 30s with bilateral crackles and LE
edema with CXray revealing CHF and ABG 7.19/75/77 and pt was
intubated for hypercarbic hypoxic respiratory failure secondary
to CHF. Patient was then urgently taken to the cath lab. OF note
after intubation and initiation of propofol pt SBP decreased and
dopamine was started.  Pt was then given lasix 40 mg IV in ED.
In cath lab no significant change in 3 VD observed and no
intervention performed. Mean PCWP =37, CO = 4.9on pressors. Cath
c/b intra-procedure atrial fibrillation with cardioversion.
Patient given 80 mg IV lasix in cath lab at 11:42 am.  Patient
then transferred from cath lab for management of volume
overload, CHF and respiratory failure.

Cardiac Catherization
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

revealed three-vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
The LMCA
had a 60% distal stenosis.  The mid LAD as well as D1 each had
60%
stenoses.  The LCX had mild luminal irregularities.  The OM1
branch had
a 60% stenosis.  The RCA was totally occluded proximally and
received
collaterals from the LAD as well as right to right collaterals.
2.  Hemodynamic evaluation revealed markedly elevated
right-sided
pressures (mean RA was 22 and RVEDP was 23 mmHg), markedly
elevated
left-sided pressures (mean PCW was 31 and LVEDP was 32 mmHg),
and
moderately elevated pulmonary pressures (PA was 51/35 mmHg).
The
cardiac index was low-normal at 2.4 L/min/m2 (using an assumed
oxygen
consumption index).  There was no gradient across the aortic
valve on
pullback of the angled pigtail catheter from the left ventricle
to the
ascending aorta.  The central aortic pressure was supported with
both
dopamine and subsequently norepinephrine.
3.  Left ventriculography (using 36 cc of contrast injected at
12cc/sec)
revealed a severely reduced ejection fraction of 18%.  There was
global
hypokinesis and minimal mitral regurgitation.
4.  The right heart catheterization was complicated by atrial
fibrillation.  The atrial fibrillation was cardioverted with
200J of
biphasic current.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58 y.o. male with h/o severe CAD, CHF, DM, htn,
hyperlipidemia who p/w acute exacerbation of CHF requiring
intubation in the setting of PNA/URI.
.
[**Hospital **] HOSPITAL COURSE:
.
CAD:
-3 vessel disease -- severe but no interval progression in 8
years; s/p cath [**1-11**] w/o intervention. As there was no change in
CAD, it was felt to CHF was most likely d/t PNA or viral
infection. The pt was felt to not currently be a candidate for
intervention.
-Continued ASA and statin. Started metoprolol for BP control as
well as CAD benefit.
.
CHF/Pump/fluid status:
-EF = 15% on new cath, decreased from 40% on echo in [**2119**].
-S/p 3-4 L diuresis in CCU; Cr rose from 1.3 on admission to 2.2
peak, in addition to a slight increase in bicarb suggesting
close to overdiuresis.
-Lasix gtt was d/c'ed as the appeared to respond better to
boluses o
