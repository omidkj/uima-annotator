[**5-7**] ECG: Irregular supraventricular rhythm with baseline
artifact possibly atrial fibrillation, but cannot rule exclude
sinus mechanism with supraventricular premature depolarizations.

[**5-8**] LE u/s: IMPRESSION: Acute DVT involving entire right lower
extremity. Left lower extremity veins patent.

[**5-8**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Limited imaging of the lung
bases demonstrate left basilar stable bronchiectasis. There is
bibasilar atelectasis.

Imaging of the intra-abdominal organs is limited due to lack of
IV contrast. There is a stable low-density lesion within the
left hepatic lobe, too small to characterize. Calcified
gallstones are demonstrated within the gallbladder. The spleen,
pancreas, right adrenal gland, and right kidney are
unremarkable. The patient is status post left nephrectomy. Again
seen is a small left abdominal wall hernia containing small
bowel without evidence of bowel obstruction, unchanged. Bowel is
normal in caliber. The patient is status post transverse loop
colostomy. Scattered colonic diverticula are demonstrated
without evidence of acute diverticulitis. There is thickening of
the cecum focally, differential diagnosis includes infectious or
inflammatory causes, and less likely ischemic. Specifically,
there is thickening of the haustra of the cecum in this region,
which can be seen in C. diff. colitis. There is stranding of the
mesenteric fat, which is unchanged. No focal fluid collections
are demonstrated to suggest abscess.

CT OF THE PELVIS: A Foley catheter is demonstrated within the
bladder, which is relatively decompressed. There are prosthetic
calcifications. There is no ascites, lymphadenopathy or free
intraperitoneal gas. There is stranding of the presacral fat,
which is of uncertain significance. There is stable
retroperitoneal fat stranding, which may be post-surgical. No
focal fluid collections are demonstrated to suggest abscess.
There is a stable infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring
4 cm in maximum dimension. The patient is status post sigmoid
colectomy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post sigmoid colectomy and transverse loop colostomy.
Scattered colonic diverticula without evidence of
diverticulitis.
2. Stranding of the retroperitoneal fat, unchanged, may reflect
post-surgical changes.
3. Stable 4-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
4. Status post left nephrectomy.
5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
6. Left lateral abdominal wall hernia containing small bowel
without evidence of bowel obstruction.
7. Thickening of the haustra of the cecum.

[**5-8**] Stool: C. Diff positive

[**5-8**] PICC tip: negative growth

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ED with a WBC=31 and diverticulitis
on CT Scan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU, the PICC line
was removed and tip sent for culture, the foley catheter was
changed, blood cultures were taken, coumadin, plavix, and
aspirin were held, urine cultures was taken, a CXR was done, was
made NPO, and IV Zosyn and Linezolid were started.  A CVL was
placed on HD2.  Serial abdominal exams continued and improved.
On HD2, it was noted that the patient's RLE was more edematous
compared to the LLE.  A LE u/s showed complete DVT of the RLE.
A heparin drip was started. On HD3, an IVC filter was placed.
On HD4, there was gas in the ostomy and the patient's diet was
advanced.  The patient was restarted on his PO cardiac meds to
allow for proper rate control.  WBC was drifting back toward
normal.  The patient was transferred to the floor in stable
condition and was placed on a telemetry bed.  On the floor, the
patient tolerated a regular diet. The heparin drip was
discontinued. The patient was started on SC Lovenox and
restarted on coumadin.  On HD7, the patient remained afebrile,
was receiving Lovenox [**Hospital1 **], and continuing to tolerate a regular
diet.  The INR was subtherapeutic at 1.5, so will continue with
coumadin (3mg given [**5-12**] PM) and SC Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]).  In
addition, the patient was on a prednisone taper on admission
(initially given IV hydrocortisone due to NPO status).  On HD7,
the patient's prednisone was decreased from 10mg to 5mg, and the
taper will continue at the rehab facility.  The patient was
discharged to rehab on HD7, PPD4.
