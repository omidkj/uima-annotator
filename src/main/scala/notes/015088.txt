ECHOS

[**9-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The gradient was not
assessed and the leaflets are not well seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets and supporting
structures are thickened. At least moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low
normal systolic function. At least moderate mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**9-30**]: Repeated echo (unchanged, except for only MILD mitral
regurgitation)

RADIOLOGY

[**9-21**] CT ABDOMEN: Interval development of worsened pulmonary
opacities, most pronounced in the right base. This appearance is
concerning for aspiration, with note of reflux of oral contrast
into the esophagus.  Interval development of a large amount of
ascites throughout the abdomen with decrease in the previously
seen free fluid. This may reflect underlying sepsis, CHF or low
albumin state, particularly given the associated anasarca and
edematous changes in the bowel as noted above.

[**9-22**] US: Successful paracentesis. Approximately 400 cc of clear
yellow
fluid were recovered & sent for culture.

[**9-30**] CT abdomen: 1. No evidence of intra-abdominal abscess. 2.
Few tubular gas-filled structures within the left liver lobe. It
is unclear whether these represent air within the portal venous
or biliary system. There is no air within the mesenteric
vessels, or loops of intra-abdominal large or small bowel. 3.
Slight interval increase in right lower lobe consolidation,
conc
