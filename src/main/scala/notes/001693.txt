ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  White blood cells is 10.6,
hematocrit is 38.6, platelets of 341,000.  PT is 12.2, PTT
21.4, INR is 1.0.  Sodium is 141, potassium is 4.6, chloride
is 96, CO2 is 32, BUN is 35, creatinine is 1.2, glucose is
148.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus
rhythm with a rate of 64.  No significant changes from
[**2184-8-16**] electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
following an aortogram with bilateral leg run-off with
ultrasound guidance.  The arteriogram confirmed that both
grafts were occluded.

On [**2184-12-10**], the patient underwent an uneventful left common
femoral to above-the-knee popliteal bypass graft with a
reverse right basilic vein.  Postoperatively, the patient's
feet were warm.  Patient had strong Doppler signals at his
left pedal pulses.

On postoperative day #1, the patient's pulse examination had
deteriorated.  He was taken to the operating room for a
thrombosed graft.  He was re-explored and the proximal
anastomosis was redone.  At the end of surgery, the patient's
left foot was warmer than his right.  He had a triphasic left
posterior tibial Doppler signal.  He was maintained on IV
Heparin infusion.  He received perioperative Kefzol.

On [**2184-12-13**], postoperative day #3 and two, patient was
scheduled to be transferred from the VICU to floor status.
Beta blockade was resumed.  He was continued on IV Heparin
and anticoagulation with Coumadin for his bypass graft was to
start.  However, patient had an episode of hypotension with a
systolic blood pressure in the low 70s.  He was asymptomatic.
His electrocardiogram showed no changes.  His CK MB band
started at 19, 14, and then 13, which corresponded to a MB
index of 1.4%.  Patient's troponin peaked at 24.5 and then
subsequently went down to 20.9 indicating a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction.

Cardiology service was consulted.  Patient was transfused
with packed red blood cells for hematocrit of 25.  Pressors
were recommended if necessary, but were not needed for
patient to maintain his pressure after transfusion.  IV
Heparin was continued.  Addition of aspirin was recommended.
A loading dose of Plavix was given and followed by 75 mg of
Plavix po q day was started.

Cardiac catheterization was considered, but not recommended.
Patient was asymptomatic and he had just had a cardiac
catheterization in [**2184-5-1**].  An outpatient stress test
four weeks after discharge was booked.

The remainder of patient's postoperative course was
uneventful.  He was followed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Endocrine Service
to manage his insulin requirement.  During hospitalization,
patient's 75/30 insulin was supplemented with NPH insulin and
a sliding scale of regular insulin.  At discharge, [**Last Name (un) **]
recommended resuming patient's 75/25 insulin with 18 units at
breakfast and 22 units at supper.

Anticoagulation with Coumadin for his bypass graft was
started.  His goal INR was 2-2.5.  Patient was to have PT/INR
draws Monday, Wednesday, Friday by the VNA with results
called to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1720**] office.  ................... and
Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly.

At time of discharge, patient's left leg incision was clean,
dry, and intact.  He had a warm foot.  His right arm incision
was clean, dry, and intact.  There was minimal arm swelling.
Patient was to followup in the office for staple removal two
weeks after discharge.  He was to followup with the
Cardiology service one week after discharge to followup for
his perioperative myocardial infarction and also for
adjustment of cardiac medications as necessary.
