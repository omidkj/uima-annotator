History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4464**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old male with a history of diastolic
CHF (EF 60% in [**2165**]), sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker that has
been nonfunctional for 20 years, transfusion dependent anemia
with nondiagnostic bone marrow biopsy [**2168**], atrial fibrillation,
mild AS, dementia, who presented to the hospital with three days
of malaise, generalized weakness, unsteadiness on his feet, and
poor appetite.  He lives at an [**Hospital3 **] community and has
daily nursing care.  His RN referred him to the ED for the above
symptoms.  He very seldom complains of pain or discomfort,
though requested evaluation today. He commonly feels fatigued or
confused when he needs a blood transfusion, though the current
symptoms are significantly worse.  He is not complaining of
cough or shortness of breath at rest, but notes significant
dyspnea on exertion limiting to 20ft. He stopped daily group
exercises recently as well.  His appetite is poor and he lost 2
lbs recently.  He has not suffered PND or orthopnea.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98 60 82/45 18 96% RA. He was
aggressively resuscitated with 4L of normal saline and a right
subclavian line was placed. Chest xray showed evidence of
bibasilar opacities, worse on the left, with venous engorgement.
 He was treated with 1000mg vancomycin, 750mg levofloxacin.
.
On admission to the ICU, his vitals were T96.9  P74  BP120/89
RR27 Sat99/2LNC.  He is breathing comfortably.  He has no acute
complaints, though is agitated and frequently tries to get OOB
during interview while grasping at subclavian site. He's had a
dry cough for months.  He's had intermittent diarrhea for the
past few weeks due to an aggressive bowel regimen intended to
"clean him out."  On review of systems, denies abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, sore throats.  No
PND/Orthopnea, weight gain, lower extremity swelling.  No
hematuria, dysuria, muscle or joint pains.

HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, no cervical
adnopathy
Neck: supple, right subclavian in place, obscuring measurement
of JVP

anteriorly.
CV: Irregularly irregular rhythm, variableS1 + S2, loud 3/6 SEM
at the second RICS without radiation.
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema
Neuro: moving all extremities, AAOx1, no sensory deficits.


Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2170-5-17**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar opacities, raising concern for infection and/or
aspiration. Low
lung volumes. Small left pleural effusion.
2. Central pulmonary vascular engorgement.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS; CT BRAIN
PERFUSION
Study Date of [**2170-5-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. CT head demonstrates prominent extra-axial spaces,
predominantly on the
right side indicating atrophy. However, the head CT without
contrast is
limited and a repeat study can be obtained as clinically
appropriate to
exclude subtle hemorrhage.
2. CT perfusion demonstrates no large area of perfusion
abnormality.
3. CT angiography of the neck and head demonstrates no vascular
occlusion or
stenosis.
4. Pleural parenchymal changes in the lungs as described above
are partially
visualized
5. There is enlarged right lobe of thyroid that extends to
superior
mediastinum with bilateral thyroid calcifications. Clinical
correlation and
ultrasound can help for further assessment if clinically
indicated.
6. Degenerative changes in the cervical region.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with history of dCHF, anemia secondary to
chronic GIB presented with hypotension, fatigue, shortness of
breath and was found to have HCAP vs aspiration pneumonia. He
was initially managed in ICU, and was treated with Vanc/Levo,
which was later changed to vanc/levo/flagyl due to concerns of
probable aspiration etiology.  After calling out of the ICU, he
was found to be very somnolent with L facial droop, so called
stroke team.  Pt at risk for CVA given afib, not on
anticoagulation d/t transfusion dependent chronic GI bleed.
Head/neck imaging performed, and it does NOT appear that he had
a stroke.  Mental status changes likely delirium/encephalopathy;
he had been getting prn doses of olanzapine overnights while
agitated, and was likely sedated in the morning.  Has been doing
significantly better with improving mental status.  Pt was
started on very low dose haldol [**Hospital1 **], and trazodone at 8pm to
hopefully get him to sleep through the night without the need
for additional anipsychotics - ultimately he was transitioned to
25 mg of seroquel daily for agitated delerium.  He continued to
improve on this regimen with some excessive daytime somnolence
and sedation.  The seroquel should be titrated back to 12.5 mg
nightly and discontinued as needed provided that the pt. remains
calm and without agitation.  He did suffer a fall while in the
hospital with a notable superficial hematoma on the occiput.
Head CT was performed and was negative for fracture or bleeding
- hematoma noted on exam was not overtly evident in soft tissues
over occiput.

His pneumonia gradually improved with antibiotics, and he was
narrowed to Levo/Flagyl (d/c??????d vanc).  Incidental note of a
thyroid mass, TSH was checked which was fine.  D/w family, and
we are all in agreement for no further w/u of thyroid mass.
Antibiotic course was completed while in the hospital.

Pt had a foley in place, as he had period of gross hematuria,
which appears to have been d/t pt pulling his foley in the ICU.
He was on CBI and hematuria cleared. His foley was discontinued
and he was able to void on his own.

Pt had an episode of acute dCHF in the ICU for which he was
diuresed.  Episode of CHF was likely due to additional volume
from blood transfusion.  His CHF resolved, and his lasix was
later changed to daily dosing of 60 mg - this will require
further titration during his rehabilitation, as needed, for LE
ed
