Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, pt is a pleasant 82 yo male with a hx of CAD s/p MI in
[**1-/2174**], CABG [**2151**], CHF, DM, HTN, atrial fibrillation on
coumadin, who originally presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Medical
Center on [**2174-3-12**] with diarrhea for 2 weeks, subsequently
confirmed to be C diff on po vanc and IV flagyl, with hospital
course complicated by GI bleed requiring 14 units of PRBC's, who
refused further GI intervention, transitioned on [**3-25**] to CMO.

# GI Bleed: The patient was initially brought to the ICU for
melena in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. He required
many blood transfusions, and interventional radiology
recommended a tagged red blood cell scan to identify the source
of bleeding. Unfortunately, the amount of IV contrast that this
would require would likely result in worsening renal failure and
the need for dialysis, which the patient noted he would not
want. With his family present, he elected to decline further
interventions and work up of the bleeding, and the goals of his
care were changed to comfort-oriented care.

We continued to treat his c diff in an attempt to prevent
uncomfortable symptoms from the infection with po vacn q6h.  Pt
did not endorse any abdominal pain or nausea and did not require
any medications on the medical floor.  After discussion with the
family on [**3-29**], pt wished to remain CMO, but was restarted on
torsemide 100 mg daily for symptomatic respiratory distress.

Transitional Issues:

-After disucssion with the family, pt was DNR/DNI.

-Pt is amenable to re-hospitalization for non-invasive
treatments.
