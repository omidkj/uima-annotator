History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1537**] is a 56 year old man who was discharged on [**8-6**] after
plasmapheresis x 5 for [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome complicated by
ileus. He was recovering at [**Hospital **] rehab when he woke on day
of admission ([**8-19**]) with dyspnea. Vital signs were obtained and
he was found to be sating 82% on 4L NC. He improved to 90% on
ventimask. Patient was sent to ED at [**Hospital1 **] on [**2195-8-19**] and went to
MICU overnight prior to transfer to medicine due to respiratory
improvement.
Patient says he has had SOB for 6 days, when he developed SOB at
rest and while lying down.  Patient has not ambulated since
discharge secondary to weakness in LE from GB.  He says he has
difficulty eating secondary to reflux, coughing, and choking on
food, and difficulty swallowing.  His SOB worsened through the
day of admission. CXR on [**2195-8-17**] at [**Hospital1 **] revealed
infiltrates in the lower lobes in addition to the RML. He was
treated with levofloxacin and Timentin at [**Hospital1 **]. He also
developed a cough productive of yellowish sputum.  He complains
of reflux that worsens his dyspnea.  The CXR at [**Hospital1 **] was
also thought to be consistent with CHF so he was diuresed with
80 mg IV lasix resulting with a UOP of 850 cc at [**Hospital1 **].
Patient was receiving standing dose of 80 mg po qd lasix at
[**Hospital1 **].
A WBC count was obtained and was elevated at 10.9 on day of
admission to MICU. Bilateral LENIs were obtained that were
negative for DVT. An EKG was obtained that showed fist degree AV
block, and nonspecific ST changes. BNP 2 days prior to admission
was high at 140  (upper limit of normal is 99). On the day of
admission, an ABG was obtained that showed 7.46/47/117.
.
As the patient had abdominal pain, an ultrasound was obtained on
[**8-17**] which showed normal gallbladder, kidneys, common hepatic
duct, pancreas, and spleen. It was remarkable for a mild right
sided hydronephrosis and bilateral renal cysts. KUB was negative
for obstruction. A day prior to admission, his lipase was found
to be elevated at 107 but his amylase was normal.
.
In the ED, he was given vanco and flagyl. Prior to this, he
received levofloxacin.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory.  Patient was sent to MICU for O2 saturation in
80's on RA.  He was treated on 4L of 02 and his respiratory
status improved.  His po medications were held, as the patient
was found to have an aspiration risk given his dysphagia.
Patient was treated for likely aspiration PNA confirmed on CXR.
He was started on IV 500 mg qd Levofloxacin and 500 mg tid IV
Flagyl x 14 days (day 1: [**8-19**]).  Patient was transferred to the
medicine floor the following day due to improvement in
respiratory status and an ABG within normal limits.  Patient was
evaluated by speech and swallow given his difficulty swallowing
secondary to his recent [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **] Syndrome and was placed
on aspiration precautions.   He was transitioned to PO 500 mg qd
Levofloxacin and PO 500 mg tid Flagyl after he was evaluated and
taught by speech and swallow andtransitioned to pureed solids
and nectar thick liquids, later advanced to thin liquids after
repeat video swallow. Patient was initially requiring 4L NC with
an 02 sat of 95% and his 02 requirement decreased during his
hospital stay and he was sating 95/RA on [**8-21**].
.
# Neuro: Patient was followed for his recent diagnosis of
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 30065**] [**Location (un) **] and was status post plasmapheresis x 5 prior to
readmission. On exam, the patient had 4+ strength in his LE's
and 1+ reflexes in his LE's.  The neurology service followed the
patient during his admission to ensure clinical improvement of
his symptoms and recommended pain control for his LE pain
related to [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 30065**] [**Location (un) **] with Ketorlac and Morphine.  A lyme
titer was sent and was pending upon time of discharge, this lab
should be followed up outpatient.  Patient was kept on
gabapentin for pain symptoms.  Patient states neurontin makes
him drowsy in the am so dosage given in the afternoon.  Patient
given 300mg at 6pm and 11pm.  If needed and patient stable can
titrate neurotin to 300mg at 6pm and 600mg at 11pm.
.
# Renal: Patient has a history of chronic renal failure with
baseline 1.6 secondary to cystinuria for which he was taking
penicillamine. His BUN and Cr trended down during the course of
the admission and he was transitioned to oral captopril,
allopurinol and Polycitra-K for his cystinuria once he was
transitioned from NPO to liquids and pureed solids.  Patient
[**Name (NI) 8213**] and Lasix were held secondary to increased Cre, however
[**Name (NI) 8213**] restarted when Cre back to normal.  Lasix continued to be
held.  [**Name (NI) 8213**] was restarted at lower dose 25mg tid from 50mg tid,
can be titrated up if patient tolerates.  Since lasix being held
would closely watch volume status as patient with history of
flash pulmonary edema.
.
#Anemia: The patient has a documented baseline Hct of 30-35 and
a history of iron deficiency anemia.  The patient discontinued
use of iron supplementation since his previous admission given
his intolerance of iron and constipation.  His [**Name (NI) 3390**] scheduled the
patient for a capsule study and evaluation for anal nodularity
as an outpatient but it was delayed due to hospitalization.  His
HCT on [**8-21**] dropped to 24.5 from 25.1 from the day before.  He
was found to be guiac negative the even
