Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery Service.

DIAGNOSIS:
Massive hemoptysis from right middle lobe aneurysm, bronchial
artery aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 20-year-old normally healthy woman who
developed shoulder pain and took two ibuprofen.  She went to
bed and awoke in the middle of the night coughing up massive
amounts of blood.  She was taken to the emergency department
and was found to be again, coughing up massive amounts of
blood.  She was emergently intubated and transported to the
Intensive Care Unit where she underwent a flexible
bronchoscopy and clearing of the airways by the Intensive
Care Service.  She was then taken to the operating room later
that day by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] ___________________________ of Invasive
Pulmonology and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy.  He found a
 2 cm tracheal tear of the distal right trachea at the
tracheal bronchial angle.  Additionally, flexible
bronchoscopy demonstrated a pulsatile mass in the right
middle lobe which upon evaluation opened up and began
bleeding massive amounts of blood.  He evacuated the airways
of 600 cc of blood and placed a bronchial blocker down the
right main stem bronchus and inflated it.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] of
Thoracic Surgery was then consulted.  The bronchial blocker
balloon was deflated and there was no further bleeding.  We
elected to temporize this situation by performing a medial
sternotomy and placement of a mediastinal drainage adjacent
to the tracheal tear and placing a double-lumen to isolate
the right lung from the ________________ circuit.  The
following day she went to the invasive radiology angio suite
and had a aortogram which demonstrated a right middle lobe
bronchial artery aneurysm.  This was successfully embolized
due to desaturations and in the radiology suite she was
placed on double lung ventilation and subsequently developed
massive mediastinal air and high fevers.  High fevers,
hypotension and sepsis.  She was therefore taken to the
emergency department by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**] to the operating room
where she underwent a small right thoracotomy with repair of
the tracheal tear.   After several days of intubation in the
Intensive Care Unit she was finally extubated when her sepsis
cleared and was eventually discharged in good condition on
[**2146-6-7**].

PLAN:
The plan was to have her come back in one month's time to
undergo a flexible bronchoscopy and evaluation of the airway
to assess the right middle lobe bronchus in the area where
the aneurysm had been.  Additionally we will obtain a CT scan
to rule out a parenchymal mass.  I am dictating this it is
three months past the time of her discharge.  We have
subsequently performed a three month bronchoscopy and CT scan
of the chest.  There is no evidence on bronchoscopy or CT
scan of any residual mass or aneurysm within the right
frontal lobe.  Thus we will perform one more CT scan and
bronchoscopy at the six month interval to confirm the absence
of any new masses.
