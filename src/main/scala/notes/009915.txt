History of Present Illness:
79 yo F with GI stromal tumor most recently on Sutent with
recent CT scan showing progression of disease now on sorafenib,
past admissions for intraperitoneal bleed [**2-14**] omental metastasis
while on coumadin (now off), DM, hypothyroidism, atrial
fibrillation, dCHF who presented to the ED yesterday ([**2154-4-14**])
with fatigue, weakness and sob for three days. Patient was found
to have a hematocrit of 16 (baseline 28-30). She was
hemodynamically stable and transfused 2 units of pRBCs. Patient
was guaiac negative. She had a CT of the abdomen with contrast
which showed hemoperitoneum with the origin of hemorrhage likely
near known soft tissue mass. Surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said that
she was not an operative candidate. IR was consulted, reviewed
the CT, did not see any evidence of active extravasation and
felt that there was no indication for intervention at this time.
Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring. Patient
was transfused a third unit of packed cells early this am and
kept NPO. During transfusion of third unit of packed cells
patient developed a red pruritic rash thought to be a
transfusion reaction, given iv benadryl. She had a new 2L oxygen
requirement which was thought to be due to increased cardiac
demand due to severe acute anemia. She was found to have new TWI
on ECG for which cardiac biomarkers were checked and negative x
3. Patient's sorafenib was held and per discussion with oncology
fellow, patient to restart at home after discharge. Patient had
mild [**Last Name (un) **] thought to be prerenal that improved with transfusions.
Patient started on clears today, hematocrit continued to
increase to 26.9 then 30.7 this evening.
.
Of note, patient had a recent admission [**12-24**] for acute on
chronic diastolic heart failure which improved with diuresis.
Also with multiple admissions in [**2153**] for intraperitoneal bleed
due to omental metastasis in the setting of coumadin use for
atrial fibrillation. Patient also has a right medial thigh wound
that has been persistently open after cellulitis in [**2153**].
.
Currently patient denies any abdominal pain. SOB and fatigue
have improved. Her oxygen has been weaned to off. Patient does
have constipation with last BM 2 days ago. Also continues to
have pruritis and red rash, managed with sarna lotion and one
dose of po benadryl today.
.
ROS as per HPI, 10 pt ROS otherwise negative


Past Medical History:
- RIGHT MEDIAL THIGH WOUND: Developed after developing severe
cellulitis in late [**2153**] and underwent a biopsy of the area
[**2153-11-22**]. Did not heal due to DM and chemo, as was on sudent.
Was on sunitinib and this was put on hold to allow further
healing, but has since restarted low dose. Measurement of wound
was 8 x 0.5cm. The first 4 cm on the right was still open with
hypergranulation tissue present on [**12-26**].
- GIST: Diagnosed in [**2143**], treated with surgery and multiple
intermittant courses of gleevac, complicated by side effects.
She had partial gastrectomy and GIST resection in [**2143**], and a
GIST omental metastasis resection in 03/[**2153**]. Noted to have GIB
in [**Month (only) 205**] and [**2153-8-13**] due to enlarging GIST lesions. Started
on Sutent since [**2153-10-1**]. Currently on low dose Sutent
following poor wound healing as above.

EKG:Atrial fibrillation. Poor R wave progression. Non-specific T
wave inverions in leads V4-V6. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2154-1-4**] atrial fibrillation remains present but now is
slightly slower. Otherwise, no interval change.

IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Cardiomegaly.
