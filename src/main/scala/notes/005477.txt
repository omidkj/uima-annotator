CXR: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged including
cardiomegaly. Mediastinal silhouette is stable although widened
most likely due to portable technique of the study, but overload
cannot be excluded. No appreciable pleural effusion or
pneumothorax has been demonstrated.

ECHO: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
(Cardiology thinks the mitral inflows are concerning for
diastolic
dysfunction)

Brief Hospital Course:
84 year-old woman presents with right-sided chest pain,
shortness of breath, and tachycardia.  She was treated for
possible asthma exacerbation.  Chest pain and shortness of
breath resolved after the first night.  On telemetry, the
patient was found to have intermittent episodes of
narrow-complex tachycardia to the 140's.  Cardiology consult
determined that she was atrial fibrillation.  Metoprolol
uptitrated for heart rate control and warfarin started.  There
was some concern that the patient had mild diastolic dysfunction
on Echocardiogram and physical exam, so one dose of Lasix 10mg
PO given.  Patient was asymptomatic at the time of discharge.

# Asthma exacerbation s/p 5 days azithromycin, prednisone, and
nebs.

# Atrial fibrillation: Metoprolol uptitrated to tartrate 100mg
Q8H with HR 50-70. For better compliance, dosing changed to [**Hospital1 **]
dosing with Toprol XL 100mg [**Hospital1 **].  Given that her CHADS2 score is
high (HTN, Age, Hx Stroke), Warfarin 3mg started on [**2191-12-14**].
INR to be checked by VNA on [**2191-12-19**] and f/u with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2191-12-21**].

# Hypertension: On Lisinopril, Metoprolol, HCTZ

# Lactic Acidosis: Lactate up to 8.6, but patient was not
septic.  Possibly from respiratory muscle exertion given
dyspnea.  [**Month (only) 116**] have been [**2-15**] Albuterol side effect.  Lactate down
to 1.3 on day of discharge.

# Diastolic dysfunction: Patient euvolemic, does not need lasix.

Facility:
[**Hospital 119**] Homecare

Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
- Asthma exacerbation
- Atrial fibrillation
- Hypertension

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:
- Seasonal allergies
- History of stroke


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with difficulty with breathing and very fast
heart rate.  You were given medications to help for possible
asthma exacerbation.

We found that you have an irregular heart rhythm called ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION.  This heart rhythm can cause your heart rate to
get very fast.  This condition also puts you at higher risk of
forming blood clots in your heart that can cause stroke.  This
is why we are recommending that you start taking Warfarin
(Coumadin), a blood thinner.  For this medication, you will
require regular blood checks to make sure you are on the correct
dose.

Your medications have been adjusted for your heart rate control,
blood thinning, and blood pressure control.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
- INCREASED DOSE - Metoprolol 100mg twice a day (every 12 hours)
for heart rate control
- NEW MEDICATION - Warfarin (Coumadin) 3mg each evening for
blood clot prevention.
- All other medications should be unchanged.
