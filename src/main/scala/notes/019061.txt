1.  PULMONARY:  Ears, nose and throat continued to follow the

humidified O2 via the face shovel mask and was encouraged to
have suction qid to the back of the pharynx and was continued
to be monitored.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  1.  Swallow study:  The patient had
failed swallow study previously in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit and was reevaluated.  Reevaluation via oropharynx video
showed aspiration on both thick and thin liquids.  However,
upon further discussion aspiration on nectar thick felt to be
one of patient's suboptimal efforts where the patient was
rushed using straw, therefore recommendation was made to
allow the patient to continue on a honey thick diet with
puree with careful supervision of all meals.  No straws to be
used, encouraged the patient to go slowly with three swallows
per bite.  The patient did well, was reevaluated and advanced
to nectar thick liquids.  Recommendations were also made to
have medications crushed and placed in puree, although
patient did do well with small pills without being crushed.
The goal is for the patient to receive rehabilitation and
then have the swallow study repeated to monitor for
improvement.

recommendation was continue to swallow and make
recommendations.  The patient was continued on his doses of

liver which showed moderate ascites, splenomegaly and a liver
contour consistent with cirrhosis.  No abnormal liver masses
or enhancement were found and the portal vein was patent.
