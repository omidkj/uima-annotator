MI in [**2156**] followed by CABG, DM, s/p PPM for bradycardia, and
LUE DVT on coumadin who was admitted on [**7-10**] for elective R hip
replacement.

Post surgical hospital course was complicated by orthostatic
hypotension requiring overnight MICU stay with response to fluid
boluses, and, after transfer back to floor, blood loss anemia in
the setting of hematoma formation at the right hip surgical site
during re-initiation of chronic anti-coagulation.

the right leg compared to left leg, mild swelling of r leg c/t
left leg.  Good ROM at b/l knees, full sensation.

Pertinent Results:
HIP FILMS: Two postoperative films are obtained. Surgical
staples are present. Patient is status post total hip
replacement. The films are technically limited by body habitus.
The prosthesis appears to be within near anatomic alignment. No
complication is grossly evident.

On discharge hct is 28, wbc 12.3, plt 171, creat 0.6, inr 1.1.



Brief Hospital Course:
1)Post op hypotension:  Felt secondary to hypovolemia and
narcotics.  Responded to fluid bolus in ICU. Monitored overnight
in ICU.  No MI by cardiac enzymes and EKG.

2)Blood loss anemia: Pt has been on coumadin for 6 months for UE
DVT.  He has a defibrillator/PM and it is unclear as to whether
the course for anti-coag should be the usual 6 months or longer
given the threat of thrombus to the wire.  He was started on
heparin with a plan to bridge to coumadin on post op day 4 and
developed a hematoma at the right surgical site with assoc blood
drop from hct 28 to hct 20 over 36 hours.  There was no evidence
of compartment syndrome and orthopedic surgery team felt there
was no need for evacuation of hematoma.  His hct responded to 3
units of prbc and his past 2 hct checks on dc have been 26 and
28.  The coumadin was not restarted but should be considered
once at rehab.

3)CHF: Afer fluid resuscitation pt remained euvolemic.  He was
very concerned about restarting his chronic CHF meds after the
hypotensive episode and refused throughout the hospital course.
Home CHF meds include carvedilol 25 [**Hospital1 **], lasix 40 daily,
captopril 50 qd.

4)Diabetes: Controlled on insulin sliding scale while inpatient,
should restart home dose of metformin 500 daily.

5)CAD: patient is s/p MI and CABG [**2156**].  Currently CP free and
no signs of active ischemia.  Restart aspirin if hct remains
stable. Titrate on beta blocker and ace-i as above (CHF).

6) Hyperlipidemia: cont. statin
