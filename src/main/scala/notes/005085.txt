Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2123-4-17**] Transthoracic ultrasound, Insertion of #24-French chest
tube in the right hemithorax.
[**2123-4-20**] Right decortication and creation of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 72968**]
window (2 rib resection and open thoracoplasty).

History of Present Illness:
61-year-old man with end-stage liver disease on [**Month/Day/Year **] list,
CAD, HTN, past heroin use on methadone, recurrent right pleural
effusion, presented with hypotension. He was supposed to go to
his follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today, [**2123-4-15**],
in [**Hospital Ward Name 23**], when he mistakenly presented to the [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] lobby,
complained of lightheadedness, was found to have SBP in the 70s,
HR 80s, 98%RA. Patient was mentating well throughout this
episode. He was brought to th ED. Pt claims that SBP is normally
in the 80s.
.
Of note, patient has had recurrent right-sided pleural
effusions, s/p Pleurex catheter placement, multiple chest tubes.
Most recently he was admitted from [**2123-3-18**] to [**2123-4-2**] for
right-sided pleural effusion  complicated by an empyema.
Initially he had a drainage cathether placed. Due to the
inability of his lungs to expand, on [**2123-3-18**] patient underwent a
right VATS decortication. Perioperatively patient required 4
units of FFP and 3 units of PRBC. Three chest tubes were
inserted and kept in for over a week. Patient was discharged
with levofloxacin for Stenotrophomonas from pleural fluid.
.
In the ED, T 97.4, BP 94/palp, HR 80, 94%RA. Labs revealed WBC
16.3 with a left shift, Hct 31.6 (at baseline), plts 119
(baseline). INR 1.9 (baseline). Cr 2.4 from baseline of 1.3 (1.6
on discharge on [**2123-4-2**]). His LFTs were unremarkable. CXR showed
reaccumulation of R pleural effusion. RUQ u/s showed no ascites.
Patient was given 2.5 L of NS with SBP consistently in the high
70s-80s. Got vancomycin and pip-tazo. Admitted to MICU.


Past Medical History:
1. Hepatitis C: diagnosed [**2113**], received 7 months IFN treatment,
but was not responsive.
2. Cirrhosis: secondary to Hepatitis C, patient also has history
of long time alcohol use. History of esophageal varices seen on
EGD ([**2115**]), though most recent EGD ([**2121-12-11**]) showed normal
mucosa but gastric varicies on US. Had esophageal varices s/p
TIPS in [**12-3**].
3. Coronary Artery Disease: s/p DES to 70% mid-LAD [**11-30**]
4. Hypertension: uncontrolled, not currently on any medications

      ONLY ANAEROBIC BOTTLE RECEIVED.

   Fluid Culture in Bottles (Preliminary):
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).

.
[**4-15**] CXR
1. Reaccumulation of a large probably loculated right pleural
effusion with an air-fluid component noted posteriorly.
Diagnostic considerations with air-fluid component include
sterile and nonsterile etiologies such as a possibility of
recurrent or new empyema. Bronchopleural fistula may also be
considered.
2. Right middle libe collapse.
3. The reticular interstitial lines in the left lower lung have
been
documented on prior studies including [**2123-2-24**] CT.
.
[**4-15**] Abd U/s: No ascites.
.
CT chest:
1. Right chest tube now in place, with slightly increased air in
the right pleural space. Right pleural thickening has increased,
consistent with reactive change to known empyema.
2. Unchanged reticular interstitial opacities in the upper
lobes. Given
absence of change over several studies, interstitial lung
disease may be more likely than hydrostatic edema.
3. Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
4. Stable emphysema.
5. Cirrhosis.

[**4-21**] Echo: LVEF=30 %. Compared with prior, extensive regional
left ventricular systolic function is now seen and suggestive of
interim ischemia/infarction in the LAD and PDA territories

[**2123-4-30**] EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and

disorganized background and the bursts of generalized slowing.
This
finding suggests widespread encephalopathy. Metabolic
