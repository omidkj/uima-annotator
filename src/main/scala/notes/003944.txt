[**2157-12-23**] - Cardiac Catheterization
Successful placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump.

[**2157-12-23**] - ECHO
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated. A patent foramen ovale is present. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is moderate
to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the entire anterior and anteroseptal
walls. There is akinesis of the inferior wall with a possible
basal aneurysm. Remaining segments are all hypokinetic. LVEF
20-25%. . The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is a moderate calcifed aortic valve with an
aortic valve area which averages 1.8-2.2 cm2 representing
borderline mild aortic stenosis.. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen and is central and
dynamic, vena contracta 4.5 mm. There is no pericardial
effusion. IABP seen in descending aorta 8 cm below the Left
subclavian- surgeons notified of position.

Post Bypass: Patient is AV paced on epinepherine 0.07 mcg/kg/min
and phenylepherine 2mcg/kg/min. The anterior and Anteroseptal
wall motion is improved. The septal wall motion is consistent
with AV pacing. The inferior wall remains akinetic. Overall LVEF
35%. Mitral regurgitation remains [**11-26**]+. There is mild TR. Aortic
contours intact. IABP is readjusted to a position 1-1.5 cm below
the left subclavian takeoff. Remaining exam is unchanged. All
findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

[**2157-12-28**] Upper Extremity Ultrasound
Cephalic vein thrombus and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 85873**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2157-12-23**] via transfer
from [**Hospital3 **] for surgical management of his coronary artery
disease. Ipon arrival he had 10/10 chest pain. A Nitro drip was
started and an emergent intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in
the cardiac catheterization laboratory. He was then taken to the
operating room where he underwent urgent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring on serveral vasoactive infusions: esmolol,
vasopressin, milrinone, epinephrine and an insulin drip. IABP
and vasoactive medications were slowly weaned off once
hemodynamic stability was achieved. He remained intubated for
acute CHF and PNA. He was aggressively diuresed with a lasix
drip and treated with a 10 day course of vanco/zosyn which was
completed on [**2158-1-9**]. He was extubated on POD#5 but remained in
the ICU for aggressive pulmonary tiolet and NT suctioning. Mr.G
was confused post-op requiring short term haldol prn. He is
presently clear and cooperative. His chest tubes and wires were
removed per protocol. On POD#5 he was noted to have LUE swelling
and an ultrasound revealed cephalic vein thrombus for which a
heparin drip was started. Enteral feedings via a dobhoff tube
were intitiated for nutritional support which have since been
d/c'd and Mr. G has a healthy appetite. He was noted to have  a
sternal click on POD# 11 which has remained stable and does not
[**Doctor Last Name **]. He NEEDS STRICT STERNAL PRECAUTIONS. He was transferred to
the stepdown unit on POD#14. Mr. [**Known lastname 85873**] developed rapid afib
which was treated with betablockers and amiodarone and has
converted to sinus with brief periods of atrial fibrillation
which is rate controlled. He was on a heparin drip bridge to
coumadin. He has been receiving low dose coumadin while on
amiodarone- Most recent INR 1.6 on [**2158-1-9**]- and recieved 3mg
coumadin. He has failed repeated voiding trials -most recently
[**2158-1-8**]- foley remains in place. Of note, he has a stage 1 area
on his coccyx.

His post operative course was complicated by Afib, coag +Staph
PNA, respiratory failure and sternal click.
