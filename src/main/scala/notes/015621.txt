Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 77 year old man, Nursing home resident, w/ multiple
medical problems including dementia, HTN, CAD, DM, CKD who
presents from NH with increased agitation, found to have acute R
thalamic stroke, as well as acute on chronic renal
failure/hyperkalemia.
.
# Right thalamic stroke:  Pt presented with mental status
changes/agitation, in work up found to have Right thalamic
stroke - per CT scan report, likely hypertensive.  Patient with
history of hypertension, and is on aspirin as an outpatient.
Neurology was involved with his care and he was closely
monitered, maintaining his blood pressure initially at 140-160
with IV labetalol PRN.  Repeat head CT day after admission
showed no change in stroke.
He was discharged off of his antihypertensives except on lower
metoprolol, with holding parameters and instructions to increase
as needed for blood pressure control.  He will have a repeat CT
scan done in 4 weeks and follow up with neurology after the CT
scan.
.
# Hypertension:  On metoprolol, dilt SR 120 [**Hospital1 **], and hydralazine
as outpt.  Likely stroke above is hypertensive in nature.  His
antihypertensives were held on admission for more control over
his blood pressure, and as above, he was discharged on only
lower dose metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **], no other BP medications, with
plans to adjust as needed to maintain SBP 120-140 over the
coming weeks.  Please consider restarting Dilt SR 120 [**Hospital1 **] after
4 weeks to recontrol his BP.
.
# Mental status changes/agitation:  Patient presented from
nursing home with increased agitation/confusion on top of
baseline dementia.  Likely caused by acute stroke above.
Further work up included infectious work up given leukocytosis
(see below), as well as sending off ammonia, TSH, LFTs, depakote
level which were all normal.  Mental status improved to baseline
during hospital course.
He was given seroquel as needed for agitation, as initially he
was given haldol, but this caused alot of rigidity and
parkonsonian features, so should be avoided.  Only give Seroquel
if truly needed as his MS had improved to baseline at time of
discharge.
.
# Leukocytosis:  Initial lab values demonstrated elevated WBC,
no bandemia.  Infectious work up was initiated including blood
and urine cultures which were unremarkable, and a CXR that
showed possible aspiration pneumonia.  He was known to have had
a recent admission to [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] (d/ced [**2162-12-30**]) with
an aspiration pneumonia, so it was unknown if the CXR was
actually improved from this admission.  He was initially
maintained on Vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl for possible
nosocomial/aspiration pneumonia coverage, but the patient's
respiratory status remained stable, he had no fevers or
hypothermia, so these were discontinued after 48 hours.
The patient also reportedly had a history of c diff and was on
PO vancomycin on admission.  C diff was rechecked during
hospital course and returned negative, but due to family
insistence, he was continued on oral Vancomycin.  His diarrhea
was completely resolved and this should be discontinued in
discussion with his Primary care doctors.
.
# Renal failure/Hyperkalemia:  Patient has a history of CKD,
baseline Cr 2.8-3.1 per records from [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 **], as
well as history of hyperkalemia in the past.  On admission, his
Cr was 3.2, K was 6.7.  He was given IVF with resolution of his
Cr to normal.  His EKG initially did show peaked t waves,
evidence of his hyperkalemia.  He was given sodium bicarbonate,
calcium gluconate, insulin/D50, kayexalate x multiple times with
eventual resolution of his hyperkalemia.  Given his difficult to
control potassium, renal consult was obtained, and recommended
starting the patient on lasix 40mg PO daily.  He was started on
this regimen, and his potassium stayed stable during remainder
of hospital course.  His Potassium was stable prior to discharge
and Lasix was discontinued.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus:  Patient is on glyburide and insulin
sliding scale at his nursing ho
