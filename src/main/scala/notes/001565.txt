Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain/Dyspnea on Exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2137-6-6**] Cardiac Cath
[**2137-6-10**] Aortic Valve Replacement with 23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Regent
Mechanical Valve

History of Present Illness:
66-year-old male with aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation,
coronary artery disease and type II diabetes who was admitted
for cardiac catheterization following an abnormal stress test.
He had been doing well until [**2137-5-1**] at which time he developed
chest burning and dypnea on exertion. He was admitted and
underwent nuclear stress test on [**2137-5-2**] where he was able to
exercise 6 minutes on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol and stopped due to
fatigue. Nuclear images revealed a new partially reversible
inferolateral wall perfusion defect and a fixed inferior wall
defect. He was referred for cardiac catheterization. In the cath
lab he was found to have single vessel coronary disease as
previously but his aortic valve area was 0.68 cm2. He is being
admitted for aortic valve replacement.

Past Medical History:
Aortic Stenosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Atrial Fibrillation, Chronic
Diastolic Heart Failure, Chronic Kidney Disease, Chronic back
pain, Gout, s/p Tonsillectomy

Social History:
He is married and works as a French and Spanish teacher in a
high school. He does not smoke or drink. He has two daughters.

Family History:
His mother had CABG @ age 80. Father died of Lung ca (smoker).
HTN and DM in family.

Physical Exam:
T: 97.9 BP: 117/73 HR: 83 RR: 18 O2: 97% on RA
General: Well appearing male, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
CV: RRR, s1 + s2, II/VI SEM radiating throughout
Resp: clear to ausculation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
GI: obese, soft, non-tender, non-distended, +BS
GU: no foley
Ext: WWP, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema
Skin: No rashes
Pulses: DP and PT pulses palpable bilaterally

Pertinent Results:
ECG ([**6-6**]): Atrial fibrillation at a rate of 82. ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**6-6**]): 1.  Selective coronary
angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated single
vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main demonstrated no
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease.  The left
anterior descending artery demonstrated mild diffuse disease
throughout without any significant stenosis.  The left
circumflex demonstrated a totally occluded obtuse marginal
filling via right to left collaterals.  The right coronary
artery demonstrated no angiographically apparent disease. 2.  LV
ventriculography was deferred. 3.  Limited resting hemodynamics
demonstrated normal right (RVEDP 7 mm hg) and left (LVEDP 7 mm
Hg) heart filling pressures.  The cardiac index calculated via
the Fick method was preserved at 2.0 L/min/m2. 4.  The mean
pressure gradient across the aortic valve was 47 mm Hg and a
peak of 60 mm Hg.  The calculated aortic valve area of 0.68 cm2.
  The aortic valve was heavily calcified.
Echo ([**6-10**]): PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). 2. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is lateral wall hypokinesis of the
mid to the apical segments ). Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). 4. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 5. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. 6. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation,
the pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an
OVERestimation of true mitral valve area. 8. There is no
pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study,
the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including
phenylephrine and is being AV paced. 1. A well-seated bileaflet
valve is seen in the aortic position with normal leaflet motion
and gradients (mean gradient = 15 mmHg). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. 2. Left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 45%). 3. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 4.
Aortic contours are intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted following his
cardiac cath which revealed Aortic Stenosis and single vessel
coronary artery disease. He received medical management for
several days and underwent pre-operative work-up while awaiting
for surgery. On [**6-10**] he was brought to the operating where he
underwent a aortic valve replacement. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-operative day one
his chest tubes were removed. He was started on beta blockers
and diuretics and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight.
Also on this day he was started on Coumadin with Heparin bridge
for mechanical valve. Coumadin was titrated. On post-op day two
his epicardial pacing wires were removed and his was transferred
to the telemetry floor for further care. Cleared for discharge
to rehab on POD #11 Target INR is 2.5-3.0 for mechanical valve.

INR in uptrend on DC 2.1.
