Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 87 yo F with metastatic lung CA refractory to
chemo, hx breast CA, COPD, recent admission for demand ischemia
who presented with complaints of heart burn. The patient has a
history of lung CA and followed Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17535**], and has undergone
partial wedge ressection, chemo, and XRT with continued disease
progression. The patinet also has a substantial smoking history,
and continues to smoke. She has had recent mild COPD flares,
with symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and wheezes, with improvement
on a prednisone taper.

The patient was recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**1-6**] -
[**1-7**]. She presented with complaints of SOB, and was treated
with IV solumedrol and avelox. Cardiac makers were cycled due to
precordial TWI, with a midly elevated troponin I at 1.10. She
was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization, which
showed no focal lesions. Her elevated cardiac markers were
attributed to demand ischemia, and she was treated through
medical management.

She was seen recently by per PCP and was doing well in follow
up. Of note, Omeprazole was d/c'd and replaced with ranitidine
to avoid interaction with Plavix. Over the last three days, she
has been experiencing increasing fatigue, nausea, and decreased
appetite. She complains of feeling an acid like burn in her
stomach. She denies any frank chest pain, shortness of breath
from baseline, fevers. Similar to prior, she endorses symptoms
of fatigue and a non-productive cough. With these symptoms, she
was reffered to the ED for evaluation.

On arrival to the ED, T 97.1, BP 84/55, HR 94, 100% on 4L. She
was given 2L of NS, and SBP quickly improved to 100 and has
remained there since. She was given a dose of CTX and ASA 325mg.
She was admitted to the MICU for further management.

Social History:
Lives alone in a senior home on the [**Location (un) 448**]. She is a widow
and has no children. Niece is health care proxy. Smoked for 70
years and currently smokes 4 ciggarettes a day. No EtOH or drug
use.

two others with cardiac disease; one brother with cardiac
disease and one with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer; mother w/ cardiac disase and
father died of PNA.

Studies:
[**2183-2-6**] Transthoracic ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no
mass/thrombus in the right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no systolic anterior motion of the
mitral valve leaflets. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global
biventricular systolic function.

[**2183-2-6**] EKG - Sinus rhythm. There is borderline resting sinus
tachycardia. Borderline left axis deviation. Possible prior
inferior myocardial infarction. Relatively low limb and lateral
precordial voltage. Non-specific ST-T wave change. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2183-1-6**] repolarization abnormalities
are less apparent.

[**2183-2-6**] AP CXR - IMPRESSION:
1. New increased area of opacity in the left upper lobe may
represent pneumonia or progression of neoplastic disease.
Multifocal ill-defined pulmonary opacities represent patient's
known metastatic lung cancer.
2. Grossly stable right pleural effusion-thickening.

[**2183-2-7**] PA & LAT CXR - Nevertheless, the pre-existing bilateral
opacities, likely to represent a combination of malignant and
inflammatory disease, have increased in extent.  The cardiac
silhouette is unchanged, the right pleural effusion is
distributed in a slightly different manner, but its overall
extent is unchanged. Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 17536**] is a 87 year old female with a history of COPD,
CAD, metastatic NSCLC, who presented with chest pain, likely
secondary to worsening GERD symptoms, and was found to be
hypotensive.

# Hypotension: Hypotensive to 80s on presentation, but had
resolved and remained stable with IVF hydration. Did not require
pressors. Most likely volume depletion in the setting of
nausea/vomiting and poor PO intake, as well agressive
antihypertensive regimen in the setting of 25 lb weight loss. No
evidence of cardiogenic shock, with normal TTE, no EKG changes,
and essentially stable cardiac markers. Additionally, no
evidence of active infection, without fever, white count, and no
concerning infiltartate on CXR. Blood pressure medications were
held in the ICU and on the floor and her blood pressure remained
well controlled with SBP 110 - 140.  Given her stable blood
pressure and tachycardia with ambulation, as well as known CAD,
her atenolol was restarted on discharge.  Her lisinopril and
hydrochlorothiazide/spironolactone were not restarted.

# Heartburn: Given recent discontinuation of PPI, her symptoms
were most likely from uncontrolled reflux. Given her known CAD,
she was ruled out for an MI. EKG was without ischemic changes
and cardiac markers did not rise above 0.03. She was restarted
on a PPI since plavix was on for medical management of CAD. Both
the PCP and oncologist were emailed by the ICU team.

# Shortness of breath / COPD flare. The patient's symptoms were
difficult to distinguish from those caused by her underlying
lung cancer.  Advair and albuterol were continued per home
regimen along with standing atrovent nebs in the ICU. The
patient was started on a Predisone taper.  On the floor her
wheezing improved on this regimen and she kept her oxygen
saturation
