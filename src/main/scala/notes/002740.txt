Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
GIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is an 81 yo f with a history of diverticulosis and 2
recent episodes of GIB who had another GIB on [**2101-8-31**] prompting
her admission to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital. In the AM of [**8-31**], patient
had mild incontinence followed by a bloody bowel movement,
accompanied by clots. She described a dark hue to the contents
of her BM. Then, on the AM of [**9-1**], she had another bloody BM.
She denied any lightheadedness, changes in vision, abdominal
pain or chest pain with these episodes. (Though, a note from the
[**Hospital1 8**] ED notes that the patient had a syncopal type episode
while in the ED) She had a tagged RBC scan which was unable to
identify the source of bleeding. Hence, she is being transferred
here with the objective of IR guided embolization. On admission
to [**Hospital 8**] hospital, her Hct dropped from 30->22. She was
transfused with 2U PRBC and given 2 PIVs. Her Hct rose from 22
to 25.4 and thus she was transfused another 2 units PRBCs.

Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: 81 yo f with PMH diverticulosis and history of GIB was
transferred from OSH with recent GIB. Per report, source was
identified on tagged RBC at OSH and she was transferred here for
IR embolization. We obtained records from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
which showed that the tagged RBC scan didn't reveal any source
of bleeding. Pt had a previous colonoscopy which showed severe
left sided diverticulosis. Pt's source of recent GIB was most
likely secondary to diverticulosis. During this hospitalization,
pt didn't have any bowel movements. Serial hematocrits remained
stable. Pt was evaluated by IR and surgery who didn't feel that
any immediately intervention was indicated. Pt was evaluated by
GI who recommended a repeat colonoscopy. If pt were to re-bleed,
she will need a repeat tagged RBC scan and possible
embolization. Please continue to check serial [**Hospital1 **] hematocrits.
Pt has not had a BM in 4 days - please titrate bowel
medications, for a BM.

.
# CRI:  Lisinopril was held in setting of elevated creatinine.
Further data revealed that baseline creat is around 1.8, and pt
was restarted on Lisinopril. Urine lytes showed low FeNa and
FeUrea, suggestive of pre-renal state; however, urine Na was not
low. Clinically pt appears to be volume overloaded.
.
# CHF: Pt noted to be in mild CHF, likely in setting of volume
rescusitation. Pt has bilateral pleural effusions. Pt was
diuresed with IV Lasix. Pt needs to continue with diuresis. Echo
was performed - final read is pending. Prelim tech read is
normal EF with evidence of obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.
.
# HTN: - Initially BP meds were held in setting of GIB. Then, pt
was restarted on lopressor and lower dose of nifedipine.
Lisinopril was initially held in setting of elevated creatinine,
and pt was put on IV hydralazine. Further data revealed that
creatinine is at baseline, so Lisinopril was restarted. Pt was
also restarted on home dose of nifedipine.

.
# RUE swelling: Pt was noted to have RUE swelling, which is most
likely secondary to IV infilatration. RUE U/S was negative for
DVT.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Pt was continued on lipitor.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI - confirmed with patient.
