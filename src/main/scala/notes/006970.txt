History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 13257**] is a 86 year old female with a history of
breast cancer, DM, HTN, CKD Stage III/IV, PVD, HCC and cirrhosis
who presents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The pt
reports that she has had abdominal pain for weeks, but that on
[**5-3**] after eating lunch the pain got so bad "that she couldn't
stand it anymore" and was "shooting across the stomach." The pt
had never had pain similar to this before. Currently her pain is
a constant dull pain that is diffuse. In the ED, the patient's
daughter reported that her mother had no fevers at home but had
been having chills. On arrival to the floor the pt developed
nausea and non-bloody vomiting, but had not had these symptoms
prior. Pt's dtr denied any altered mental status. She did report
some diarrhea, no melena or constipation. The patient also
reports that she has had some dyspnea on exertion recently,
unable to relate how long. She currently feels like she is
"panting."
.
In the ED, triage vital signs were: 98.2 66 117/39 16 100% 2L.
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, which was positive for
SBP. RUQ ultrasound showed gallbladder wall thickening and
possible acute cholecystitis. Foley was placed. Ceftriaxone,
flagyl, morphine and zofran were given. Cipro was started
originally, but pt began to develop "red blotches" ([**Name8 (MD) **] RN
notes) so cipro was stopped. Transplant surgery saw the patient
and recommended an ICU bed for monitoring of SBP and broad
spectrum abx for SBP and UTI, as well as HIDA scan to further
evaluate for cholecytitis.
.
.
On floor, patient began vomiting, reported mild shortness of
breath and reports that her abdominal pain is improving.
.
