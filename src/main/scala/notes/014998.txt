Brief Hospital Course:
# Hyponatremia:
Patient was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit
for closer monitoring. He received hypertonic saline, and was
carefully monitored as his sodium was corrected nicely to his
goal of 125-126, taking care not to correct no more than [**10-30**]
mEq in the first 24 hours. His hypertonic saline was
discontinued  and he continued with fluid restriction and a high
salt diet. He was monitored on telemetry and neurological checks
were completed frequently. It was felt that he had SIADH, given
that his hyponatremia worsened initially with intravenous
fluids, his low urine osmolality, and his euvolemic state. Due
to his known brain metastases and concern over worsening edema
and risk of seizures, he was treated with keppra and steroids to
minimize the edema and seizure risk.
- The nephrology team was consulted and also assisted with
management of the patient's hyponatremia.
.
# Small cell lung cancer: Patient had recently completed cycle 1
of cisplatin and irinotecan on day of admission. His allopurinol
was continued.
Outpatient radiation oncology appointment was set up in
[**Hospital1 1474**], closer to the patient's home, for the week following
his discharge.
- He was continued on keppra and steroids, which were slowly
tapered down, for his known brain metastases.
- His chemotherapy was held due to continued diarrhea and
neutropenia.
- Patient was neutropenic, but his cell counts trended upward
prior to discharge and he was no longer neutropenic at that
time. He had no fevers or signs of infection while neutropenic.
.
# Diarrhea: The patient noted diarrhea that was worst during his
first few days of hospitalization. Studies for c. difficile were
negative, and his diarrhea was managed with immodium as needed.
It resolved prior to discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Patient initially was hypertensive, and his home
medications of atenolol and lisinopril were continued. However,
during his course his blood pressure was on the low side, so
these medications were held.
.
# Bipolar disorder/Anxiety:  Depakote had been discontinued 1
week prior admission due to concern over possible interaction
with chemotherapy. Although hyponatremia was felt to have some
role in the patient's agitation, it was also possible that the
discontinuation of depakote was also playing a role. Psychiatry
was consulted and followed along during the patient's stay, and
recommended seroquel and ativan to assist with his agitation. He
was not felt to be manic during his stay.
Follow up appointments with psychiatry were coordinated and set
up as well.
.
# Hyperglycemia: Patient was noted to have elevated blood
sugars, which were felt to likely be secondary to steroids. His
steroids were tapered down, but the hyperglycemia persisted.
Insulin and glucometer teaching were completed with the patient
and his wife, and he was sent out on NPH and a sliding scale of
insulin.
.
# Thrush: Patient noted to have thrush, thought to be secondary
to steroids. Nystatin swish and swallow cleared his thrush
nicely and was continued along with clotrimazole.
.
# Fluids, electrolytes, nutrition:
  - Heart-healthy diet was followed
  - 1L fluid restriction
.
# Prophylaxis:
  - Proton pump inhibitor was initiated due to steroid use.
  - Subcutaneous heparin was used for DVT prophylaxis.
  - His home statin was continued for cardiac prevention.
  - Physical therapy worked with patient and he was felt to be
safe for discharge to home.
