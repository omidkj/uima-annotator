ASSESSMENT:  This is a 65-year-old woman, with a history of
alcohol abuse, who presents with hypophosphatemia and
alcoholic ketoacidosis.  In the ED, she also had coffee
ground emesis, although her hematocrit remained stable.

HOSPITAL COURSE - The following is a summary of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course by systems:

1) HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA:  The patient received ample phosphate
repletion while she was in-house, and on her day of discharge
was no longer hypophosphatemic.

2) ALCOHOLIC KETOACIDOSIS:  The patient was aggressively
treated with Insulin and glucose, fluids, and electrolyte
repletion in the Medical Intensive Care Unit to the extent
that her anion gap and acidosis resolved.

3) COFFEE GROUND EMESIS:  The patient was seen by the
gastrointestinal team while she was in-house.  Her hematocrit
was followed in the hospital and did not drop significantly.
She was started on PPI.  She was made NPO at first, but then
slowly advanced in her diet.  She underwent an EGD prior to
discharge which revealed no [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, erythema, and
erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis, no
esophageal varices, and an otherwise normal EGD.  She was
continued on her PPI and will be continued for 4 weeks.
Biopsy results at the time of this dictation were pending.
The gastrointestinal team recommended follow-up appointment
as an outpatient, as well as a screening colonoscopy.

4) ALCOHOL INTOXICATION:  The patient was maintained on a
CIWA scale to monitor her for withdrawal.  She received
valium accordingly.  The patient was visited by the substance
abuse team, and the patient requested transfer to an
inpatient psych facility for treatment of her alcohol
dependence.

5) ESSENTIAL TREMOR:  The patient was treated with nadolol
with subsequent improvement of her essential tremor.  She
continued to have one, however, at baseline.

6) DEPRESSION:  The patient was continued on her Zoloft.

7) FEN:  The patient underwent aggressive electrolyte
repletion, as mentioned above.  She was made NPO at first,
but as her hematocrit remained stable and she had no
abdominal complaints, she was advanced as tolerated to a full
diet.

8) PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was treated with Protonix, as
mentioned above, as well as Pneumoboots and a bowel regimen.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Hospital1 **] for inpatient substance abuse
treatment.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Alcoholic ketoacidosis with hypophosphatemia.
2. Essential tremor.
3. Depression.
4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
5. Gastritis.
6. Alcohol abuse.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient will follow-up with GI for a
colonoscopy, as well as follow-up of her coffee ground
emesis.  The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician as needed.  The patient will receive inpatient
psych care at [**Hospital1 **].
