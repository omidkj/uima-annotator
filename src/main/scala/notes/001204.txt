Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 14820**]
Chief Complaint:
acute dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with DM2, HTN, and recent dx of a-fib 1 month ago
presents with acute dyspnea and found to be in afib with RVR.
The patient recently started taking diltiazem and coumadin 3
weeks ago. He was feeling well until he acutely felt short of
breath yesterday morning. He presented to his PCP's office where
an EKG was significant for afib with RVR in the 140s. He was
then sent to [**Hospital3 **] for further evaluation.  CXR
revealed pulmonary edema and fluid overload. He was started on a
hep gtt for a sub-therapeutic INR, diltiazem gtt, nitro gtt, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vitals BP 96/68  HR 107. He was given 80 then
160 mg IV lasix with approximately 1L urine output. In spite of
a diltiazem gtt, his HR remained in the 110s. A repeat CXR
showed small bilateral pleural effusions and mild pulmonary
edema.  Labs were significant for a troponin leak up to 0.66
with flat CKs, BNP [**Numeric Identifier 39390**], INR 1.5, and Cr 1.7.  While in the ED
overnight, he desatted down to low 80s and was placed on BIPAP
and then a NRB with sats improving to >94%.  He was unable to be
weaned off the NRB in spite of putting out approximately 1 L
urine to IV lasix.  Due to continued tachycardia, respiratory
distress, and ? hemodynamic instability, the pt was taken for
TEE/cardioversion.  TEE revealed a left atrium thrombus.  He was
then admitted to the CCU for further care.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He reports having calf pain on exertion and is on cilastazol for
peripheral arterial disease.  He also reports have 2 incidents
of hypoglycemia in the past month; his beta-blocker was stopped
and he was started on a CCB.  All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea, but the
absence of chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.

IMAGING:
.
[**2137-11-12**] CXR
IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly with bilateral small pleural effusions
and mild
pulmonary edema
.
[**2137-11-14**] CXR
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**11-12**], there is
continued
cardiomegaly with apparent worsening of the pulmonary edema.
Generalized
haziness bilaterally is consistent with large pleural effusions
.
[**2137-11-15**] CXR
There is marked
improvement in the bilateral perihilar parenchymal opacities
representing
marked improvement of pulmonary edema.  There is no change in
bilateral
moderate pleural effusions and bibasal atelectasis.  The
moderately enlarged heart is stable and there is no change in
the mediastinal contours.
.
[**2137-11-17**] CXR:
Previous pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions have
resolved.  Mild cardiomegaly and upper lobe vascular congestion
remain following substantial improvement in congestive heart
failure.  No pneumothorax.
.
[**2137-11-13**] TEE:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus/ mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). A probable thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the
body of the right atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the right atrial appendage. The right atrial appendage
ejection velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in
the right atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. LV systolic function and right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (severity
of mitral regurgitation may be UNDERestimated due to limited
views). There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Probable left atrial appendage thrombus. Moderate
mitral regurgitation (may be underestimated). Biventricular
systolic dysfunction.
.
[**2137-11-18**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are moderately thickened with characteristic rheumatic
deformity/restricted anterior and posterior leaflet motion..
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial
mitral stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Minimal rheumatic mitral stenosis. Mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Low normal left ventricular systolic
function Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2137-11-12**] ECG:
Atrial fibrillation, average ventricular rate 100-110.
Non-specific
repolarization changes. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2135-3-21**] normal
sinus rhythm has given way to atrial fibrillation and the
ventricular rate has increased.
