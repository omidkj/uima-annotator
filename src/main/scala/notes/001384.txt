Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
Vomiting, lethargy, and headache.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EVD placement


History of Present Illness:
63-year-old male with history of ESRD secondary to diabetic
nephropathy on hemodialysis MWF, Hepatitis C with cirrhosis,
pacemaker for ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, recently discharged from [**Hospital6 2561**]
[**8-21**] for a middle ear infection and has continued to feel unwell
since discharge.  History is provided by wife and brother as
well
as chart review.  On the morning of admission, the patient was
in
the bathroom vomiting and his wife had heard a fall.  He was
found on the ground and complained of right occipital headache
and generalized weakness.   He was initially responsive and able
to converse with his family however became for somnolent over
the
next thirty minutes and continued to vomit.  He had to be
carried
to bed but family did not note any focal motor deficits.
Patient
was taken to [**Hospital6 2561**] by EMS and was noted to be
arousable only to painful stimuli.  He was noted to have BP
244/128 and CT head showed a thalamic bleed with
intraventricular
extension.  He was given vitamin K 5 mg, mannitol 50 gm,
labetalol 100 mg IV (total), ativan 2 mg x1, etomidate 20 mg,
rocuronium 70 mg, and loaded with dilantin.  He was intubated
and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  In the Emegency
Department an EVD was placed by neurosurgery.  He was started on
a nicardipine drip and transferred to the SICU.  As per
patient's
wife, home SBP ranges 130-190 and had been "very high" during
his
recent hospitalization at [**Hospital3 **].


Past Medical History:
HTN
HLD
Diabetes Mellitus
ESRD on HD MWF
Central retinal vein occlusion (R)
Pacemaker for ischemic cardiomyopathy
OSA
Depression

CT head; Extensive interventricular hemorrhage extending from
the
lateral ventricles to the third and fourth ventricles with
associated ventriculomegaly.  Focus of acute hemorrhage
immediately adjacent to the left lateral ventricle likely
involving the left thalamus and may represent source with
interventricular extension, an underlying mass/lesion/vascular
malformation cannot be excluded in this region.

CT C-spine; no fracture or malalignment.

EEG [**8-27**];
IMPRESSION: A diffusely slowed and monotonous record was seen
representative of a diffuse and moderate to moderately severe
encephalopathy.

CT head [**8-30**];
There has been removal of the right ventriculostomy catheter
with a small
amount of residual blood tracking along the prior path through
the frontal
lobe. Overall, the left thalamus hemorrhage appears similar in
extent to the
prior examination. There remains unchanged amount of
intraventricular
hemorrhage layering posteriorly within the lateral ventricles.
There is
persistent diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is unchanged
from the prior
examination. The ventricles sizes are enlarged, but unchanged.
There are
areas of periventricular low attenuation likely related to
chronic small
vessel ischemic disease.

The left mastoid opacification is unchanged from prior
examination. There are
no new bony abnormalities on this exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 931**] is a 63-year-old male with hx ESRD on HD, DM,
HTN, HLD, ischemic
cardiomyopathy, and HCV, presented with large left thalamic
bleed with significant
intraventricular extension, s/p EVD in ED (OP at 30 cm H2O).
Given location of hemorrhage as well as his longstanding history
of uncontrolled hypertension, etiology was most likely thought
to be hypertensive, and his fall was likely secondary to his
bleed.

Hospital course by problem;
1) Neurology; The patient was admitted to the NeuroICU after an
EVD was placed given the hydrocephalus on exam.  He was started
on a nicardipine drip for blood pressure control.  He was
started on labetalol and carvedilol in attempt to wean the
nicardipine drip with goal SBP < 160.  Norvasc 5 mg daily was
added [**8-31**].  His EVD was removed [**8-29**] and a repeat CT head has
been essentially unchanged.  He was started on keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **]
[**8-31**] for anti-seizure prophylaxis given his recent EVD and it is
thought that he may continue this for one month.  He could not
have an MRI because of his pacemaker. A CT head was done showing
with early uncal herniation, increased cerebral edema. EEG with
flattened activity. The patient expired on [**2159-9-5**].

2) Respiratory; The patient was intubated at time of arrival and
had a tracheostomy [**8-28**].  There are no other active respiratory
issues.

3) ID; The patient had a recent diagnosis of otitis media.  In
addition due to his EVD he was maintained on cefazolin for
prophylaxis.  This was discontinued when his EVD was removed on
[**8-29**].  He has been afebrile with no leukocytosis and cultures
from the time of admission have been negative.  However on [**8-31**]
a repeat CXR showed a possible RLL consolidation suggestive of
pneumonia.  He was started on ciprofloxacin [**8-31**].

4) CV; The patient was monitored on telemetry and troponins were
stable at 0.30.  It was thought this was secondary to his stroke
and end stage renal disease.  As the cardiac enzymes were level
during the hospital course it was not thought to be cardiac in
etiology.  Initially he was hypertensive and managed as
indicated above. During the course of his ICU stay the patient
developed hypotension requiring mulitple fluid boluses.

5) Heme; The patient's hematocrit, coags, and platelet count
have been stable.

6) Metabolic/Endocrine/Renal; The patient was followed by the
nephrology service, receiving dialsyis qMWF.  His fingersticks
were well-controlled with a regular insulin sliding scale.

7) Abd/GI; The patient was followed by the liver service as he
was already known to them given his hepatitis C.  He had been on
inteferon prior to admission but it was recommended to
discontinue at this time as it has not been effective.  Tylenol
intake was limited to 2g daily.  A PEG tube was placed [**8-28**].
