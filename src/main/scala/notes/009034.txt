Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital3 **] with hypothermia, hypoglycemia,
sinus bradycardia, altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Fistulogram ([**2120-12-10**]).


History of Present Illness:
A 62 year-old female with type 2 diabetes, chronic systolic and
diastolic congestive heart failure, history of stroke and
seizures throught secondary to prior stroke, transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] with altered mental status, hypoglycemia,
hypothermia, and sinus bradycardia. She was brought in by EMS
[**2120-11-28**] at 0830 after a call from family members that the
patient was hypoglycemic - they had given glucagon and glucose
was 80 on check by EMS. In the OSH ED, core temperature was
initially 84 and increased to 89 degrees on heating blanket.
Pulse 34, sinus bradycardia on EKG, increasing to 44. Blood
pressure 159/86, and then 111/56. Laboratories significant for:
Sodium 147, creatinine 1.8, glucose 126, TSH 25, free T4 0.86,
normal serum cortisol, urinalysis indicative of urinary tract
infection with WBC> 100 and positive leukocyte esterase. Urine
and blood cultures were sent. Chest x-ray clear per report. She
was given atropine 0.5 mg IV, levaquin 750 mg IV, and
approximately 2L NS. The patient was seen by endocrinology who
recommended giving hydrocortisone 200 mg IV and synthroid 150
mcg IV for concern for myxedema coma or adrenal insufficiency.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she initially was alert but nonverbal.
PERRL and no deviation. She cooperated with simple commands and
was moving all extremities well. She then developed a
generalized seizure and was administered ativan 2 mg IV. She had
left deviation of the pupils immediately following, which then
corrected.
.
Of note, the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for
hypoglycemia, hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia
[**Date range (3) 70559**], presumed due to [**Date range (3) 3080**] from a urinary source
by urinalysis, however, urine culture grew only yeast (unclear
if sent prior to antibiotics). She required 11 liters IVFs in
her first 24 hours. She developed respiratory distress due to
volume overload and was intubated. She was treated empirically
with a ten-day course of vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin
with improvement after 24 hours. Blood, urine, sputum, BAL,
respiratory viral, stool cultures were negative. Superficial
wound culture from a foot ulcer grew VRE, however, this was not
believed to be responsible given her improvement without
antibiotic therapy directed against VRE.

IMAGING:
.
Endometrial biopsy ([**2119-12-15**])
Pathology report PENDING.
.
Small bowel follow-through ([**2119-12-12**])
No evidence of enterouterine, enterovesicular or enterovaginal
fistula is seen.
.
Pelvic ultrasound ([**2120-12-11**])
Transvaginal ultrasound only was performed. The uterus was well
seen and
measures 5.2 x 2.9 x 4.1 cm. The endometrial cavity is seen and
a small amount of fluid without evidence of echoes or debris is
seen. Some calcification of the arteries is present consistent
with a diabetes but no
evidence for fistula could be identified either within the
uterus or within
the cervix as visualized. Note is made of considerable amount of
wall thickening of the bladder and debris within the urine.
IMPRESSION: Fistula not seen.
.
Fistulogram ([**2120-12-10**])
1. No definite evidence of fistula.
2. No evidence of obstruction.
.
MRI Pelvis ([**2120-12-8**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No rectovaginal fistula demonstrated. No fistula to the
uterus seen on images covering the entire uterus, however,
contrast-enhanced imaging did not cover the entire uterus.
2. Trabeculated, thickened urinary bladder wall, likely
neurogenic.
3. Trace free fluid in the pelvis.
4. Small uterine fibroid.
.
MRI Brain ([**2120-12-5**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings in the right parietal lobe likely represent subacute

infarct. Recommend follow-up imaging for further evaluation.
2. FLAIR hyperintense foci within the white matter of both
cerebral hemispheres and brainstem, nonspecific. The
differential diagnosis is extensive and includes chronic
microvascular ischemic changes. Other entities including
vasculitis, lyme disease and sarcoid cannot be excluded.
Clinical correlation is recommended.
3. No hypothalamic abnormalities.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2120-12-1**])
IMPRESSION:
1. Irregularly thickened bladder wall. While the relatively
large amount of air within the nondependent portion of the
urinary bladder may relate to recent catheterization, cystitis
with gas-forming organism cannot be
excluded.
2. Anasarca and free fluid within the pelvis, unchanged from the
prior, likely related to right-sided CHF.
3. Progressive focal aortic ulceration, consistent with
penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer.
4. Unchanged findings of chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic
duct stent in place. Mild biliary ductal dilation also
unchanged.
5. Narrowed celiac artery, unchanged.
6. Residual faint nodular infiltrate at the lung bases,
significantly improved. Persistent interlobular septal
thickening likely due to congestive heart failure.
.
EEG ([**2120-11-29**])
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to a slow and
disorganized background indicative of a moderate encephalopathy.
