HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 74-year-old gentleman
presented to the Cardiology service with history of
intermittent chest pressure and dyspnea on exertion for
approximately 4-5 weeks.  He had an episode of chest pain on
the day of admission.  He said it did not radiate, but it is
also not associated with any nausea, dizziness, vomiting,
palpitations, diaphoresis.  He said it usually happens when
he is lying down while he is short of breath and is relieved
by walking around and it seems to happen frequently to him
and it lasts about 25 minutes.  Recently he complains of
shortness of breath even with minimal walking in his house.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes type 1.

Hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He drinks approximately 1-2 drinks per day
and has a 30 pack year history of tobacco.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

He was admitted to the Cardiology service for workup for his
chest pain and was started on Heparin, aspirin, beta-blocker,
nitroglycerin.  Placed on telemetry to determine whether or
not he would rule in or out for myocardial infarction.
Lisinopril was held because of his renal function.

At the time of admission, over the next 48 hours, he was
covered by the Cardiology service in preparation for cardiac
catheterization, which was determined when he had elevated
troponins and ruled in for non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction.  Creatinine preoperatively was 1.5.  It is
unknown what the patient's baseline creatinine was, but the
patient was aware of chronic renal insufficiency and patient
received hydration prior to going to cardiac catheterization
and was covered by Cardiology service, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].

Cardiac catheterization was performed on the [**8-3**],
which revealed severe three-vessel disease with plaquing in
the left main, heavily calcified LAD with subtotal occlusions
of first septal and diagonal 2.  Diagonal 1 had a 70 percent
lesion.  Circumflex was totally occluded in the A-V groove
with moderate plaquing in the OM-3.  The right coronary
artery had proximal and ostial 80 percent lesions and was
totally occluded in the mid portion.  Patient also had
moderate-to-severe LV diastolic heart failure.  His LVEDP was
23 as well as moderate pulmonary artery hypertension and
mitral regurgitation.  Patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Also includes appendectomy at age 6.

ALLERGIES:  He had no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME HE WAS SEEN:
1. Glyburide 1.25 mg by mouth daily.
2. Lipitor 10 mg by mouth daily.
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg by mouth daily.
4. Multivitamin by mouth daily.
5. Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth daily.
6. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth daily.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On exam, he is 6 feet tall, 109 kg or
240 pounds with a temperature of 96.6, blood pressure 118/62,
in sinus rhythm at 76, respiratory rate 20, and saturating 94
percent on room air.  He was sitting upright in bed in no
distress.  He is alert and oriented times three and
appropriate.  He had no carotid bruits.  He had diminished
breath sounds at the right base and fine rales at the left
base.  His heart has regular rate and rhythm with S1, S2
tones and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  His abdomen is soft,
round, nontender, and nondistended with positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities were warm and well perfused with no
peripheral edema.  No varicosities noted, but some
superficial spider veins.  He had 2 plus bilateral radial
pulses, 1 plus bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses, 2 plus PT
pulse on the right, and a 1 plus PT pulse on the left.

PREOPERATIVE LABS:  White count is 7.8, hematocrit 29.5,
platelet count 261,000.  Sodium 139, K 4.3, chloride 105,
bicarb 25, BUN 31, creatinine 1.4 with a blood sugar of 137.
PT 12.9, PTT 28.7, INR 1.0.  ALT 17, AST 17, alkaline
phosphatase 38, amylase 36, total bilirubin 0.6.  Urinalysis
was negative.

Preoperative EKG showed sinus rhythm at 71 with PVCs, a left
atrial abnormality, and a question of both anteroseptal old
myocardial infarction and an old inferior wall myocardial
infarction.

Additional laboratory work done showed a calcium of 9.0,
magnesium 2.0, hemoglobin A1C at 5.8 percent.

Preoperative chest x-ray showed background COPD with probable
mild CHF and small effusions.  Please refer to the x-ray
final report dated [**2175-12-2**].

Preoperative CTA of the chest showed no evidence of pulmonary
embolism as well as bilateral pleural effusions and increased
septal thickening consistent with interstitial edema from
mild LV congestive heart failure.  It also noted calcified
coronaries and aortic atherosclerotic disease.  Please refer
to the final report dated [**2175-12-2**].

On [**12-6**], the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting times four by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a LIMA to the
LAD, vein graft to the PDA, vein graft to the OM, vein graft
to the diagonal.  He also underwent mitral valve repair with
a 30 mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] annuloplasty band.  He was transferred to
Cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on a propofol drip at
10 mcg/kg/minute, Levophed drip at 0.03 mcg/kg/minute,
milrinone drip at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute, and an insulin drip at 2
units/hour.

On postoperative day one, he was on a lidocaine drip for
premature ventricular contractions.  Remained on Levophed,
which was weaned during the day, milrinone drip at 0.25,
lidocaine drip at 1 mg, and insulin drip at 5 units/hour.
Postoperatively, his white count was 11.1, hematocrit 29.4,
platelet count 138,000.  BUN 34, creatinine 1.6.  He remained
sedated and intubated on ventilatory support.

On postoperative day two, the patient was extubated, remained
on milrinone drip, and Natrecor was started at 0.01 for his
heart failure.  He remained on a lidocaine drip at 1.
Aspirin was started and he also began IV Lasix diuresis.  He
received some Ativan for agitation.  His creatinine rose
slightly to 1.8.

Preoperative echocardiogram estimation of his ejection
fraction was 15 percent.  Patient was seen by Cardiology
everyday for assistance with his congestive heart failure
management.  He was also seen by the clinical nutrition team.
Patient was started on carvedilol beta-blockade, transitioned
off his Natrecor.  He was weaned off the Levophed and
milrinone and remained on the Natrecor drip at 0.01.
Diuresis continued.  Creatinine decreased slightly to 1.6.

He was also seen by Electrophysiology service.  At that
point, he was off all his drips.  The patient was awake and
alert on exam, and was also seen by Physical Therapy for
initial evaluation, though he remained in the ICU.

On postoperative day four, he was hemodynamically stable on
no drips.  Receiving IV Lasix and carvedilol.  Creatinine
continued to improve to 1.4.  White count dropped to 9.8.
Hematocrit was stable at 29.  Foley was discontinued.  A line
was also discontinued.  He remained in Cardiothoracic ICU an
additional day pending resolution of his ATN and to monitor
him closely for ectopy.  He was restarted on his lisinopril
and seen by Case Management in preparation for moving out to
the floor.

On the 15th, the patient was transferred out to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 to
begin work with Physical Therapy.  He was seen again by the
EP fellow to evaluate him for workup for possible ICD in
approximately one month postoperatively, also pending whether
or not his ejection fraction improved.  Patient was also
evaluated by the CHF service from Cardiology.

On postoperative day six, the patient did have one run of
nonsustained V-tach and continued on all of his oral
medications.  His exam was unremarkable and incisions were
clean, dry, and intact.  He had positive bowel sounds.  Had 1
plus peripheral edema.  Decision was made that the patient
would follow up with EP postoperatively in one month.
Patient was strongly encouraged to work with his incentive
spirometer and improve his pulmonary toilet as well as
increasing his by mouth intake in all preparation for his
probable discharge t
