Pertinent Results:
pt deceased during this hopital stay. Pertinant studies / labs
on this admission.

Echo [**2182-10-3**]:

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
anteroseptal, anterior, and apical akinesis (the basal lateral
wall moves best). No apical thrombus seen (but cannot exclude).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe 3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. EF of 25%

CT head [**10-3**]:

IMPRESSION:

1. No intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, infarct, or mass effect.

2. Stable appearance of an ill-defined area of low attenuation
within the
right temporal lobe, corresponding to a cystic lesion with
surrounding edema  seen on the previous MRI examinations.
Recommend follow up MRI with contrast  to monitor lesion
size/characteristics.
3. Chronic microvascular infarction and lacunar infarction

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted on [**2182-9-22**] to [**Date Range 1106**] service for b/l lateral foot
pain / b/l gangrene of the feet.

[**2182-9-23**] - [**2182-9-24**]

Pt pre-op'd in the usual fashion / consented

Broad spectrum AB started.

Cx taken.

Pt set up for HD through nephrology for CRI.

[**2182-9-25**]

Pt undergoes a Bilateral transmetatarsal amputation, toes one
through five. Extubated in the OR. No complications noted.
Extubated in the OR. Transfered to the PACU in stable condition

Once recovered from aneshtesia. Pt transfered to the VICU in
stable condition.

[**2182-9-26**] - [**2182-9-29**]

Pt transfered to floor status / has increase temperatures. C/O
pain.

[**2182-9-29**] - [**2182-9-30**]

Pt difficult to arouse / somolent - CT head negative

Pt improves after narcotics stopped.

Pt with cardiac enzymes / EKG / CXR

CXR shows - pna - AB started

pos troponin ( could be secondary to CRI ), ckmb pos (
cardiology consulted ), pt transfered back to the VICU [**2182-10-1**]

[**2182-10-1**]

Becomes hypotensive with bradycardia / chest pain / repeat EKG
shows t wave inversions

SL nitro improves chest pressue

ASA given

Cardiology sees pt -

* Started on heprin drip

* Ischemia: Continue ASA, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, lipitor to 80.
Will consider addition of integrillin and plavix, however, if
remains stable will hold off. Will need to check with pharmacy
if there is a HD dosing of integrillin.
- Holding beta blocker given 1st degree AV delay and
bradycardia.
- EKG findings concerning for antero-septal-infero
ischemia/infarct ((?high LAD).
- NPO after midnight for possible cath in AM.
- Continue cycling enzymes -> if chest pain recurs and persists
or enzymes rise again will need to consider earlier cath.


* Pump: Last echo suggestive of diastolic dysfunction, though
this was prior to recent events. Will need to repeat echo or LVG
ASAP. At present does not appear volume overloaded and will not
need diuresis.
- Pending evaluation of EF, will likely need ACE. Consider
spironolactone if evidence of heart failure, but none at
present.

* Rhythm: First degree AV delay, sinus brady. No interventions
at present given asymptomatic. If becomes hemodynamically
unstable, will need to consider pacer wire vs.
pharmacotherapeutics (dopamine, isoproterenol etc.)
- Continue Amiodarone (presumably for afib)

* ESRD/HD: Will need dialysis in AM.
- Recheck lytes now given asterixis concerning for uremia.
