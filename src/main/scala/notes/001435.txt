History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 26442**] is a 82M with history of CAD s/p CABG (LIMA to LAD,
SVG to diagonal), HTN, HL presents transferred from [**Location (un) **] with
an NSTEMI. He had a recent hospital stay at [**Hospital3 **] for
hip pain that had a negative workup for fracture 1 week prior
and discharged to rehab.  The patient states that he has been
having "indigestion" over the last week that was relieved with
Alka-Seltzer.  The patient reports that on the day of admission
to the OSH he had epigastric/substernal, non-radiation
pressure/burning sensation.  He rated the pain [**2170-7-2**] and notice
some diaphoresis, but no other associated symptoms of
N/V/SOB/palpitations.  Vitals at OSH were 98 163/64 73 95% on
55% venti mask. CXR showed left lower lobe infiltrate.  The
patient denied F/C and reported a chronic productive cough that
was unchanged.  WBC of 12.1 HCT of 35.3. BUN 67 CR: 2.2 CK 277,
CK-MB 33.2 Trop 2.3. He was given plavix 300mg, aspirin 325mg,
solumedrol 125mg IV, lopressor 50mg, norvasc 10mg. He was
transferred on heparin drip and nitro drip. No antibiotics were
given.

The patient underwent cardiac cath that showed: native LMCA and
3 vessel CAD with known chronic total occlusion of the RCA with
progression with another subtotal occlusion in the distal AV
groove CX with successfull BMS.  The patient had a patent
LIMA-LAD with a 75% stenosis in the mid-distal LAD downstream of
the anastomosis that was not intervened on. He had occluded
SVG-diagonal. The patient had an end LV pressure of 44mmHg and
given 40mg IV lasix. He received a total of 270ml of dye and was
started on a bicarb gtt. The patient had worsening hypoxia
during the case and required non-rebreather and ABG during the
case was 7.34/30/71/17.

The patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.
On arrive he was 99% on a non-rebreather.  He diuresed 700cc to
the lasix. Denied chest pain or SOB.  He stated he was tired and
wanted to sleep.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of c paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this co-dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel disease. The LMCA was a moderately
calcified
vessel with a distal 50% stenosis. The LAD was a heavily
calcified
vessel. There was an ostial 60% stenosis immediately before D1,
after D1
there was a 70% proximal LAD stenosis. The mid LAD has difuse
70%
stenosis and showed competitive flow. The 1st septal branch had
a
proximal 50% stenosis. The D1 had a proximal 70% stenosis before
a
bifurcation in the vessel and a 40% stenosis in the small branch
of
vessel immediately after the bifurcation. The Cx had diffuse
disease
throughout. There was 60% stenosis in the proximal LAD prior to
the OM1.
There was 50% stenosis between OM1 and OM2 and 60% stenosis
between OM2
and OM3. There is a series of heavily calcified 90% stenosies in
the
distal AV groove Cx. The distal AV groove Cx supplies a long
LPL1 branch
and a small LPDA. The LPL has only TIMI2 flow. The RCA had a
proximal
70% stenosis prior to the atrial branch as well as a mid total
occlusion
after the acute marginal. The distal RCA and distal acute
marginal
filled via right to right collaterals.
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the origin of the LIMA
to have
a 35% stenosis which improved to 20% after intra-atrerial
nitroglycerine. The LIMA was patent therafter to the mid LAD.
There wasa
75% stenosis in the mid-distal LAD downstream of the LIMA
touchdown and
diffuse 60% stenosis of the apical LAD. The LAD provided septal
collaterals to the RPDA. The SVG to D1 was occluded at the
origin.
3. The left subclavian artery had a proximal 30% stenosis with
midl
plaquing throughout.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revelaed severely elevated left
sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 44 mmHg. The central aortic
pressure
was 165/56 mmHg. There was no transaortic valve gradient on
pullback of
the catheter from the LV to the aorta.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
