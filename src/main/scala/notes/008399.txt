Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M with h/o HTN presenting with NSETMI and 3v disease on
cath with mild cardiogenic shock.  Patient was taken to the cath
lab on admission and found to have L main disease and 3vD.  An
emergent CT surgery consult was made, but the decision was made
to delay surgery until the end of the weekend for vein mapping
and carotid ultrasound given the patient's recent Plavix load
and lack of symptoms at time of presentation.  An IABP was
placed, the patient was started on ASA, Lipitor, nitrate drip
and heparin, and his cardiac enzymes were trended with a peak CK
of 155.  On HD2, he developed new TWI in V1-V6, but remained
asymptomatic.  His metoprolol was restarted as his HR and BP
were able to tolerate it, and his nitrate drip was discontinued.
 A TTE showed a preserved normal LVEF. Following pre-operative
work-up, patient was cleared for surgery, and taken to the OR on
[**2142-2-26**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 4.
Please see op note for surgical details. He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in stable
condition on minimal Inotropic support. On post-op day one he
was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was
then extubated. Inotropes were weaned off but he then required
Nipride for hypertension. All drips were weaned off later this
day and he appeared stable and was transferred to the cardiac
surgery step-down floor. B blocker and diuretics were started
per protocol. During his post-op course he was gently diuresed
towards his pre-operative weight. Chest tubes were removed on
post-op day one. On post-op day two his heart rhythm went into
atrial fibrillation and he was bolused with Amio and started on
a drip which was eventually converted to po. By discharge his
rhythm was NS. His epicardial pacing wires were removed on
post-op day three. Physical therapy worked with patient during
entire post-op course for strength and mobility. He appeared to
be recovering quite well, with stable labs, vital signs and
physical exam. He cleared level 5 and was discharged home on
post-op day four with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
