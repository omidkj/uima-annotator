Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. No ASD by 2D
or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Top normal/borderline
dilated LV cavity size. [Intrinsic LV systolic function likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV free wall thickness. Normal RV
chamber size.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. No MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] vena contracta is >=0.7cm Severe (4+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. The patient received antibiotic
prophylaxis. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
4. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
mitral regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a central jet with
bilateral leaflet retraction. The annular size is enlarged at
3.7 cm.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of Phenylephrine, epi, milrinone.
Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral position with 1-2+
residual Mitral regurgitation. The LVEF is 40% on inotropic
support, but may represent an overestimation due to mr. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
remains 1+. The aortic contour is normal post decannulation.



Brief Hospital Course:
He underwent the usual preoperative work up and on [**4-8**] went to
the Operating Room for mitral repair and single vessel graft.
He weaned from bypass on Milrinone, Epinephrine and
NeoSynephrine infusions.  He transferred to the CVICU intubated
and sedated.

Over the next few days he weaned from vasoactive drugs and was
extubated.  He required reinstitution of milrinone for support
and again weaned off, this time with Lisinopril for afterload
reduction.  He had heart block post operatively and EP saw him,
there was no indicastion then for a pacemaker.
rapid atrial; fibrillation recurred and Amiodarone was given.
Coreg was then added due to his underlying heart failure. He
continued to have a ventricular rate in the 110-130 range and he
was digitalized with good rate control into the 80s.  As he was
on three nodal agents EP was reconsulted and they recommended to
continue the current regimen and wean Amiodarone as usual.

Coumadin was resumed and arrangements were made for the Greater
[**Hospital 487**] Health Care Center to follow this as before. Follow up
apppointments were made and instructions discussed with the
patient and his wife.
