Date of Birth:   [**2105-12-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery Service

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
female with a known history of hypertension who presented
with the rapid onset of substernal chest pain which radiated
down her left arm at 9:30 p.m. on the prior evening.  On
[**11-16**], she had some shortness of breath.  She rated her
chest pain at approximately [**8-11**] to [**9-10**].

At [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency Room, at 10:13 p.m., an
electrocardiogram showed 3.5-mm elevations in leads I, aVL,
and V2 through V5 and 2-mm ST depressions in leads III and
aVF.  She received RPA 10 units times two, intravenously
heparin, and aspirin.  She remained pain free, and she had
some improvement in the ST elevations.  About 30 minutes
later she had about 3/10 chest pain.  Electrocardiogram had
further improvement and some normalization of the ST
segments.

She was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department and was pain free.  When she presented
to the Emergency Department she was seen by Cardiology.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypercholesterolemia.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Degenerative joint disease.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications with unknown doses
included Celebrex, Fosamax, Protonix, and verapamil.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient was
seen by Cardiology in the Emergency Department.  The first
set of laboratories came back revealing her sodium was 137,
potassium was 4, chloride was 103, bicarbonate was 24, blood
urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 0.9, and her blood
glucose was 137.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The plan was to
stabilize the patient given the successful fibrinolysis, and
last dose of RPA was at 2330 the night prior.

The patient was continued on intravenous heparin, and the
plan was to give the patient aspirin and a beta blocker and
start the statin, and leave her nothing by mouth for
catheterization, and give her intravenous hydration prior
cardiac catheterization, and also perform an echocardiogram
in the morning.

She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.  Her white blood
cell count was 13.4, her hematocrit was 40.7, and her
platelet count was 230,000.  She was monitored in the
Coronary Care Unit.  Her INR was 1.5.  Her partial
thromboplastin time was 150.  Prior to cardiac
catheterization, her creatinine was 0.9.

She had no evidence of heart failure on examination on
admission.  She had no jugular venous distention.  Her heart
was regular in rate and rhythm.  Normal first heart sounds
and second heart sounds.  Her abdominal examination was
benign.  Her lungs were clear bilaterally.  Her abdomen was
soft, and she had 2+ distal pulses in her legs.  Prior to
going to the Catheterization Laboratory, her pulse was in the
60s.  She was saturating 97% on 2 liters via nasal cannula.
Her blood pressure was 90s to 100 systolic.

She was continued on a beta blocker, and intravenous heparin,
as well as Protonix.  She was started on captopril 6.25 mg
three times per day and was started on aspirin and Lipitor
prior to going to the Catheterization Laboratory.  She did
have several episodes of ventricular tachycardia overnight.

The patient was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory on the morning of [**9-17**].  Please refer to the
cardiac catheterization report.  In essence, the patient had
coronary artery disease and a ventricular septal defect from
her acute myocardial infarction.

She was brought from the Catheterization Laboratory directly
to the operating room.  A call was placed emergently from the
Catheterization Laboratory with the notation of the
ventricular septal defect and an apical aneurysm.  The
patient was immediately transferred to the operating room.
The patient still had the femoral arterial sheath in place,
and an intra-aortic balloon pump was also in place.

The patient was transferred emergently to the operating room.
Please refer to the Operative Report by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].  The patient underwent emergency repair of the
ventricular septal defect with multiple patches a left
ventricular aneurysmectomy under general anesthesia by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] with assistance by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].

The patient did not survive the operation and expired in the
operating room during surgery at 7:36 p.m. on [**2179-9-17**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  (For coding purposes, the following
should be listed)
1.  Status post emergent repair of ventricular septal defect
with patches and left ventricular aneurysmectomy.
2.  The patient also has hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Degenerative joint disease.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient expired in the operating
room on [**2179-9-17**] at 7:36 p.m.
