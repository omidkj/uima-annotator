HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
87-year-old female who was transferred from her nursing home
after a fall.  She is diagnosed with a urinary tract
infection on [**2105-3-22**] at her nursing home which grew
MRSA and was sensitive to Macrobid and thus was started
treatment on this.  Per the patient, she felt ill for one to
two days prior to admission and friends said that she looked
pale.  The patient reports leaning over in her wheelchair to
pick up a Kleenex and fell out, hitting her head.  She has no
specific complaints and denied dysuria, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, chest pain, shortness of breath.  The patient has a
history of falls.  In the Emergency Room, the patient was
found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response to the 120-140s and decreased systolic blood
pressure to the 60s to 70s.  Her temperature was 97.1.  It is
of note that she is an DNR/DNI.  The patient's white count
was elevated to 17.7.  She was begun on the sepsis protocol
and was transferred to the ICU for management.  She received
4 liters of normal saline, ceftriaxone 1 gram, vancomycin 1
gram, and was started on Levophed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple history of falls felt to be multifactorial.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  CVA in [**2092**] and small CVA or TIA in [**2105-2-1**].

5.  CABG with porcine aortic valve replacement in [**2092**], on
Coumadin.
6.  Degenerative joint disease.
7.  Right total hip replacement in [**2100**].
8.  Cataract surgery.
9.  CHF, questionable diastolic heart failure.
Echocardiogram in [**2105**] showed an ejection fraction greater
than 65% and atrial myxoma 2 cm, symmetric LVH, mild dilation
of the left atrium, 1+ aortic regurgitation.
10. History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
11. MRSA UTI in [**2105-2-1**].
12. Questionable aspiration pneumonia in the past.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Total abdominal hysterectomy.
2.  Appendectomy.
3.  Hemorrhoidectomy.

ALLERGIES:   Sulfa.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a resident at the [**Hospital3 14109**] Home.  She is a DNR/DNI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature
97.1, pulse 107, blood pressure 113/45 on Levophed,
respirations 22, saturations 100% on 4 liters nasal cannula.
The patient was in no acute distress.  Lungs:  Bilaterally
clear to auscultation.  Heart:  Irregularly/irregular.
Extremities:  The lower extremities were with edema.
Abdomen:  The belly was soft, nontender.  Sensation was
intact.  Neurologic:  The patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Rectal:  Guaiac negative.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cells 17.7,
hematocrit 34.2, platelets 207,000.  The laboratories were
significant for a creatinine of 1.4, lactate 4.0.  The
urinalysis showed small leukocyte esterase, large blood,
trace protein, a few bacteria.  There were 2 epithelials.
The LFTs were within normal limits.

Head CT was negative for hemorrhage, showed no acute changes.

A CT of the C-spine showed degenerative changes but no
evidence of fracture.  A chest x-ray showed a right IJ line
tip in the right atrium and diffuse bilateral interstitial
opacities consistent with CHF.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation, rate 150s, T wave inversions
in V4 through V6, lead II and aVF, new versus [**2105-2-1**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former three pack per day smoker, stopped 20
years ago but smoked for 40 years.  Former heavy alcohol use,
currently none.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  SEPSIS:  It was thought that the
patient had urosepsis due to her recent positive culture with
MRSA in her urine.  The patient was pan cultured upon
admission; however, there is no growth to date of this
dictation.  The patient had an elevated white blood cell
count with a left shift; however, remained afebrile.  She was
treated empirically with vancomycin and Levaquin upon
admission to the SICU; however, Levaquin was discontinued
within 24 hours and the patient was simply treated with
vancomycin.  The patient was fluid resuscitated, received 1
unit of packed red blood cells.  Levophed was weaned within
the initial 24 hours.  The patient's lactate trended
downwards.  The patient's cortisol was 36.  She was not given
steroids.  The patient's blood pressure returned to her
normal baseline of systolic 130s/diastolic 70s.  Her
Lopressor was held during her SICU course and should be
restarted upon normalization of her blood pressures.  The
patient will likely receive a seven to ten day course of IV
vancomycin for her MRSA urosepsis.

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Upon admission, the patient
received 2 units of FFP for an elevated INR of 6.6 upon
admission.  Her Coumadin was held until her INR reached 2.2.
She was restarted on her Coumadin at a lower dose than prior
to admission since the patient is being treated with
antibiotics.  At the time of this dictation, the patient is
currently on 1 mg p.o. q.h.s. but this should be adjusted as
needed to keep her levels 2.5 to 3.5 as indicated for her
aortic valve replacement.  The patient's rate was better
controlled during her course in the SICU.  The patient was
slightly tachycardiac to the 100 teens.  However, she was not
given nodal blockers due to her borderline hypotension.  The
patient was asymptomatic of her rapid rate and will likely be
started on her Lopressor in the next 24 hours once her blood
pressures are stable.

3.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  An echocardiogram in [**2105-2-1**] shows likely diastolic dysfunction with an ejection
fraction of greater than 65% and symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy.  The patient will start on her beta blocker once
blood pressure has normalized and has started Lasix diuresis
in the SICU prior to transfer to the floor.  She had crackles
on examination likely due to her aggressive fluid
resuscitation upon admission as well as pitting edema in her
lower extremities.  The patient will benefit from gentle
diuresis as her blood pressure allows.

4.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has a history of
CABG.  She was continued on her statin and aspirin therapy.
Her beta blocker was held for her urosepsis.

5.  ANEMIA:  The patient's anemia was new during this
hospitalization.  Trended hematocrits were within normal
range prior to this hospitalization.  The patient has no
history of anemia.  Her stools were guaiaced and initially
negative.  Iron studies, B12 and folate were sent and are
pending at the time of this dictation.  There is no record of
a colonoscopy in the medical record; however, it is noted
that she had a polypectomy in her surgical history.  This
should be followed as an outpatient.  With the exception of a
blood transfusion upon admission, the patient did not require
any further packed red blood cells.  Her hematocrit remained
stable in the low 30s.

6.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient's Lopressor was held because
of borderline hypotension.  This will be restarted once the
patient is stabilized.

7.  AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT:  The patient was on long-term
Coumadin which was restarted prior to transfer to the floor
at low dose.

8.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  The patient has
questionable safety to swallow.  She was seen by Speech and
Swallow during her admission and was approved for thickened
fluids and soft solids.  She was continued on this diet
during her admission.

9.  RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had mild acute renal failure
upon admission likely due to a prerenal state and sepsis.
Following aggressive IV fluid hydration, the patient's
creatinine decreased to 0.7.

10.  STATUS POST FALL:  The patient's fall is presumably due
to hypotension and tachycardia as well as sepsis.  The
patient was ruled
