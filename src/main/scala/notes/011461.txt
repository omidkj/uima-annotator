                            **FINAL REPORT [**2115-10-8**]**

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2115-10-8**]):
      FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
      Reference Range:  Negative.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2115-10-8**] 10:00 AM
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT
Reason: BILATERAL SWELLING. R/O DVT
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
28 year old man with fevers
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o dvt
INDICATION: 28-year-old man with fever.
COMPARISON: None.
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color Doppler examination of the deep
veins of both thighs and posterior knees demonstrates normal
compressibility, color flow, respiratory variation, and
augmentation. There is no sign of intraluminal thrombus.
IMPRESSION: No DVT.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-10-8**] 11:42 AM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: eval s/p bronch
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
26 year old man with high resp rate and lot of secretions
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval s/p bronch
INDICATION: Tachypnea and secretions; status post bronchoscopy.
PORTABLE AP CHEST: Comparison is made to examination performed
10 hours earlier. Tracheostomy tube, enteric tube, and right
subclavian central venous catheter remain in stable position. Of
note, right subclavian central venous catheter remains within
the proximal right atrium. In the interval, there has been
improvement of previously evident diffuse bilateral multifocal
air space opacities, with bibasilar opacities persisting. There
are no definite pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is
identified.
IMPRESSION: Interval placement in diffuse bilateral airspace
opacities, consistent with resolving pulmonary edema. Persistent
bibasilar air space opacities are noted.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-10-7**] 10:25 PM
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Reason: please eval interval change in intracranial hemorrhage
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
28 year old man s/p gunshot to head
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval interval change in intracranial hemorrhage
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
INDICATION: Evaluate interval change and intracranial
hemorrhage.
COMPARISON: [**2115-9-21**].
TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.
CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again, seen are multiple
bone fragments within the brain parenchyma in the right parietal
lobe and soft tissues secondary to the gunshot wound. Since the
examination of [**2115-9-21**], there has been evolution of
multiple hemorrhagic foci within the right temporal and parietal
lobes. There is, however, increase in hypodensity within the
anterior aspect of the right temporal lobe consistent with edema
or infarction, and stable hypodensity within the posterior
aspect of the right temporal lobe and parietal and frontal lobes
consistent with stable edema in these areas.
Although the images are limited by motion artifact, no definite
new intracranial hemorrhage is identified. There is near
complete resolution of the small amount of blood previously seen
in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. The
tentorial subdural hematoma is poorly visualized.
There is continued compressive mass effect upon the right
lateral ventricle and mild right to left subfalcine shift,
somewhat improved from prior study. A left frontal burr hole is
new in the interval since the examination of [**9-21**], and
there is hypodensity within the subjacent brain parenchyma
likely due to prior placement and removal of a transcalvarial
device such as a bolt. No evidence of foramen magnum or
transtentorial herniation is seen.
A tiny focus of pneumocephalus is again seen within the frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle.
Bone windows demonstrate new burr hole in the left frontal
cranium and continued osseous fragments within the brain
parenchyma and subcutaneous tissues on the right at the site of
gunshot wound injury. There is opacification of the left
maxillary sinus. Bilateral mastoid air cells are opacified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Continued evolution of blood products at the site of
contusion within the right parietal
