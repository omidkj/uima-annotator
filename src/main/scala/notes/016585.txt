History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 66yo lady with Afib on Lovenox, ESRD on HD, dCHF,
HTN, DMII, restricitve lung disease on home O2, necrotizing
breast infections from Warfarin skin necrosis, admission 1 month
ago for hypoglycemia and pneumonia who was brought to the ED due
to mental status changes and is initially admitted to the MICU
due to hypotension.
.
Today she was taken to [**Known lastname 2286**] by EMS as usual.  Initially she
was appropriate, but as the EMS ride continued, she began making
strange comments and ultimately became obtunded so they brought
her to the ED instead of HD.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  98.2 68 121/36 24 100% 4L.  She was
initially unresponsive except to noxious stimuli, but them
spontaneously became alert, interactive, and oriented x3.  Knew
that she was brought to the hospital because she was "acting
funny in the ambulance, I guess."  Labs were unremarkable except
Cr 5 (she is on HD).  CXR suggested volume overload but could
not rule out pneumonia.  During her evaluation, she again became
unresponsive except to noxious stimuli, with myoclonic jerks,
associated with SBP 50-60.  Blood pressure improved to SBP 100
with 500cc IVF, and she became alert again.  ABG did not suggest
hypercarbia.  No suggestion of pneumonia, but there was concern
for leg infection so she was given Vanc/Zosyn.  Given her
hypotension and periods of unresponsiveness, she was admitted to
the MICU.  VS prior to transfer were: T 99, HR 68, BP 101/51,
RR22, 97%RA.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she is only reponsive tovigorous sternal
rub.  Responds slowly to questions and falls asleep before
answering them fully.  [**Known lastname 4273**] taking any pain medications today.

EEG [**2109-3-5**]:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and

disorganized background indicative of a diffuse encephalopathy.
Infrequent sharp waves were seen in the bilateral frontal
regions, but
no clear electrographic seizures were seen. If clinical
suspicion for
seizures is high, prolonged bedside monitoring may be helpful
for
further diagnosis.

EKG [**2109-3-5**]:
Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. There are
tiny R waves in the anterior leads with a late transition
consistent with possible infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Low voltage in the precordial leads. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2109-1-16**] late transition is new.

CXR [**2109-3-5**]
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with congestive failure.
