Hematochezia

History of Present Illness:
This is a 77 y.o. male w/ Wegner's diverticulosis, AS, ESRD, and
multiple lower GI bleeds who presents with hematochezia. The
patient reports his recent medical history was notable for
development of some shortness of breath and wheezing over the
last few weeks in the setting of a viral illness. He was given
ipratroprium by his PCP with good improvement of his symptoms.
Then, today the patient awoke at around 7am and felt some
discomfort in his lower abdomen and a need to defecate, he
expected to pass gas but instead had a large bowel movement with
gross blood and clots. He has has multiple similar bowel
movements throughout the day. He denies any fevers or chills.
Endorses mild lower abdominal pain. No nausea or vomiting. No
diarrhea or symptoms preceding this. No presyncope, chest pain,
or current SOB.
He came into the ED this afternoon with these symptoms. In ED
initial vitals: T 98.7, P 75, BP 172/72, RR 18, O2 Sat 100%. He
had a right sided EJ placed and a 20 gauge IV. He did not have
any bloody bowel movements in the ED. He is being admitted to
the ICU due to a history of these bleeds becoming quite
fulminant (bled to a Hct of 17 during the previous one).
ROS: Negative for fevers, chills, night sweats, or unintentional
weight loss. He denies chest pain or SOB. No nausea or vomiting.
No hematemesis. He denies melena. No dysuria or hematuria. No
rashes or skin changes.

Imaging:
[**2122-10-4**] CXR: Moderate left and small right pleural effusion are
new. Aside from attendant atelectasis in the left lower lobe,
lungs are clear. Heart is normal size.

[**2122-10-5**] Colonscopy: A single medium angioectasia that was not
bleeding was seen in the cecum. A gold probe was applied for
tissue destruction successfully. One triclip was successfully
applied for the purpose of hemostasis.  Protruding Lesions Grade
1 internal hemorrhoids were noted.  Excavated Lesions Multiple
diverticula with medium openings were seen in the sigmoid colon.
 Other No avms seen in ileum. Impression: Grade 1 internal
hemorrhoids.  Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.  Angioectasia
in the cecum (thermal therapy, endoclip). No avms seen in ileum.
 Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and ileum.

[**2122-10-6**] Tagged RBC scan: Active bleeding at a site within the
sigmoid colon with activity moving retro- and anterograde.

[**2122-10-6**]: Capsule endoscopy progress report: GI bleeding at the
distal ileum, fresh blood seen in thecolon as well.

[**2122-10-7**] Colonoscopy: Diverticulosis of the whole colon, Clip
seen in Cecum. Capsule seen in Cecum. Of note, capsule was noted
to be in cecum about 16 hours ago. Terminal Ileum could not be
intubated despite multiple attempts. Otherwise normal
colonoscopy to cecum.

[**2122-10-7**] CXR: The interpretation of this study is limited given
the presence of respiratory motion. A small right and moderate
left pleural effusions have improved. Cardiomediastinal contours
are unchanged. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or new lung
abnormalities. Opacity in the left lower lobe is a combination
of the pleural effusion and atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 y.o. man with Wegner's granulomatosis and history of multiple
lower GIB's with known AVM's as well as diverticula and internal
hemorrhoids presenting with hematochezia.

1. Hematochezia: The patient presented with grossly bloody bowel
movements, from lower GI source, likely from angioectasias vs
diverticulosis.  Initial HCT was 29, which was at/slightly above
baseline.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.  Of note,
following admission to the ICU, the patient had a presyncopal
event on the way to the bathroom.  Vital signs measured
following event were within normal limits, but repeat Hct showed
decrease to 21.5. Initially resuscitated with 2 units pRBCc with
semi-emergent colonoscopy revealing no source of active
bleeding.  An angioectasia was visualized and clipped, although
this was not felt to be the source of bleeding.  Following
colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy was pursued to r/o bleed from
small bowel.  On [**10-5**], patient complained of recurrent
hematochezia and tagged RBC scan performed.  Tagged RBC scan
showed bleeding from sigmoid colon while capsule endoscopy
revealed hemorrhage at distal ileum.  Given conflicting results
of imaging studies, a repeat colonoscopy was performed on [**10-7**]
which showed diverticulosis of the whole colon but no active
source of bleeding.  The terminal ileum could not be intubated.
On [**2122-10-7**], the patient was felt to be stable for transfer to
the general medicine floor. The hematochezia appeared to be
self-limited, HCT was stable, and the last bloody bowel movement
was the evening of [**2122-10-6**].  His diet was slowly advanced, and
he was tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge.  He was
initially placed on a PPI, but this was stopped prior to
discharge as the etiology of his bleeding was felt to be lower
and not upper GI source.  Due to unclear etiology of the
hematochezia, the patient has been instructed to present to the
ED for emergent angio/CTA
