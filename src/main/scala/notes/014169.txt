Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 458**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization with placement of bare metal and drug
eluting stents.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 53 year old male with history of "borderline"
hypertension and hyperlipidemia who is transferred from [**Location (un) **],
where he initially presented with substernal chest pain
radiating to his left arm, shoulder, and back. This was
associated with nausea and "indigestion." He reports the pain
began at  about 7:30 pm on day of presentation while he was
fishing. He first noticed an ache in is left arm. Eventually
pain severe enough that it stopped him from fishing. He walked
[**12-5**] mile back to his car, having to stop & lay down multiple
times due to the pain. He thought pain secondary to strained
back muscle. He drove himself to [**Location (un) **] ED, stopping at
pharmacy along way to get aspirin. He took 4 aspirin tabs--he
does not know dose. At [**Location (un) **], his temperature was 98.1, heart
rate 100-120s, and blood pressure 130-150s/80-100, with oxygen
saturation 98% on room air. An EKG demonstrated 2-3mm STE in
III, aVF, V1-V3, aVR and ST depressions in I & aVL (3-4mm). He
was given plavix 600mg, heparin gtt, Aggrastat, nitro gtt,
morphine and metoprolol 2.5mg IV 2. He was transferred via
med-flight for emergent catherization for presumed STEMI--no
cardiac enzymes were available. Of note, patient also describes
a similiar, though less severe episode of chest
pain/"indigestion" about 3-4 weeks ago. Symptoms occured after
eating a large meal and resolved on their own.
.
At catherization, patient had total occulsion of LAD with
collaterals (thought to likely be old) and 90% proximal RCA
stenosis, the former was treated with DES and the latter with BM
stent. There were also lesions at LMCA (20% ostial lesion) and
D1 with 60% ostial stenosis. Patient had elevated R & L filling
pressures with preserved CI. He tolerated procedure well & was
transfered to CCU for further monitoring.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


Past Medical History:
"Borderline" HTN
"Borderline" hyperlipdiemia
.
Cardiac Risk Factors: Dyslipidemia, Hypertension


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is a remote history of alcohol abuse.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death, though multiple family members have coronary
artery disease .

Cardiac catherization:

COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had a 20% ostial stenosis
--the LAD was totally occluded after D1.  D1 had a 60% ostial
stenosis.
There were right-to-left collaterals filling the LAD
--the LCX had mild disease.
--the RCA had a 90% proximal stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures, with RVEDP 17 mmHg and mean PCWP 29 mmHg.  There was
moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 52 mmHg.  Systemic
arterial
systolic pressure was high-normal with SBP 138 mmHg.  The
cardiac output
was preserved, with CI 2.3 L/min/m2.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal right coronary
artery
with a Vision (4x12mm) bare metal stent postdilated with a 4mm
balloon.
Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent
dissection,
no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow (See PTCA comments).
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid left anterior
descending
artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug eluting stent postdilated
with a 3mm
balloon.  Final angiography demonstrated no angiographically
apparent
dissection, no residual stenosis and TIMI III flow ([**Name (NI) **] PTCA
comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Two-vessel CAD with ST elevation MI, likely proximal RCA
culprit
lesion with totally occluded LAD also noted (and filled by
collaterals
from RCA).
2.  Elevated right- and left-sided filling pressures.
3.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal right coronary
artery
with a bare metal stent.
4.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD with a Cypher
drug
eluting stent.

Chest X-ray:
IMPRESSION: AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest
radiographs:

Supine positioning may be responsible in part for hilar and
mediastinal
vascular engorgement. Heart size is top normal. Lungs are clear
and there is no appreciable pleural effusion. Widening of the
upper mediastinum
indentation in the right side of the trachea at the thoracic
inlet suggests an enlarged thyroid gland. Although a combination
of mediastinal fat and tortuous vessels could give the same
appearance.

EKG [**2165-5-17**]:
Sinus rhythm. Ventricular premature beat. ST segment elevation
in leads V1-V3

infarction, age
indeterminate. No previous tracing available for comparison.

Normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in leads V1-V4 consistent with
prior anterior myocardial infarction. There are prominent T
waves which are biphasic in leads V1-V4. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2165-5-17**] T wave inversions are suggestive of
evolving myocardial infarction or anterior ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior,
anteroseptal and apical akinesis. There is also
mid-inferior/inferolateral hypokinesis (EF 25-30%; findings c/w
multivessel CAD). A large (2.5x1.4-cm) apical LV thrombus is
seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
