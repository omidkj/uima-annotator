Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation for mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
83M with esophageal CA, recent admission for FTT, pneumonia. The
patient was sent from nursing home, reportedly ill-appearing. We
do not yet have any history from his facility, [**Hospital3 537**]. I
have left a message with the nurse on duty. The patient's sister
reports that he had been treated for pneumonia two weeks ago at
[**Hospital3 **]. (Our records suggest the patient was discharged on
[**2200-3-3**], but not treated for pneumonia at that time.) The
patient did have a prescription for levaquin in his records from
[**Date range (1) 105283**], so he probably was diagnosed with pneumonia
recently. His sister spoke to him the day before this
hospitalization and says he sounded fine. He was able to go to
lunch and dinner that evening. The patient's sister also reports
that his usual nuring support could not reach him due to the
inclement weather this week.
.
In the ED, the patient was tachycardic, hypoxic on RA on
arrival.  He was brought in looking unwell, hypoxic, and with
altered mental status. In addition, the patient was exteremly
cachectic. The patient's CXR showed PNA and he received
vancomycin, levaquin, zosyn (recently admitted with
Pseudomonas). The patient had terrible IV access and so was
underresuscitated. A Right IJ triple lumen was placed. The
patient was progressively tachypneic to low 40s, and his lactate
was 4.9. After failureo f NRB, the ED felt the need to intubate,
with sedation via fentanyl and Versed.  Though his SBP was 115
before intubation, afterward he had transient periods of SBP
around 60-90. Phenylephrine was then started. Though altered, pt
wished to be full code. (His sister was unaware of her brother's
exact wishes but felt he would probably want to be full code and
would agree to all of the items on the ICU consent form.)


Past Medical History:
Esoph Ca s/p esophagectomy with ? gastric pullup at [**Hospital1 2025**] ~ 10
years ago
Prostate Ca
Nephrolithiasis


Social History:
Immigrated from [**Country 4754**] in 62. Worked for Sears-[**Last Name (un) 40191**]. Smoked
until his esophagectomy ~ 10 years ago. No recent EtOH. Lives
independently at [**Hospital3 537**], takes his own medications,
sporadic nursing checks.

CT torso [**2200-3-18**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia and signs of atypical infection
including tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities (which can be seen with
endobronchial PNA or tuberculosis) as well as centrilobular
ground-glass nodules (which can be seen with atypical pneumonia
such as mycoplasma or viral pneumonia). Secretions within the
right main stem bronchus and trachea are likely due to extensive
infection as the patient is intubated and aspiration is less
likely.
2. Extremely limited evaluation of the abdomen, however,
possible right
hydronephrosis. If clinically indicated, a renal ultrasound
could be
performed for further evaluation.
3. Small-to-moderate axial hiatal hernia.
.
ECHO [**2200-3-19**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. No mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Very small pericardial effusion.
.
[**2200-3-19**] Renal ultrasound:
IMPRESSION:

1. Echogenic kidneys compatible with medical renal disease,
although without atrophy. Indeed the parenchyma seems mildly
swollen. No evidence of hydronephrosis or abscess.
2. Extensive ascites.
.
[**2200-3-26**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Minimally increase in opacities at the left lung base,
the other
opacities in both the left and the right lung are constant.
Unchanged high
position of the endotracheal tube, the tube could be advanced by
1 to 2 cm. No newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
Unchanged bilateral
symmetrical apical thickening.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient had a complicated hospital course including a MICU
stay where he was on pressors for quite a while as well as
refractory respiratory failure.  He was treated with multiple
courses of antibiotics for HCAP but failed to improve.  Given
his failure to improve and the severity of his illness, a goals
of care conversation was conducted by the MICU team.  The
patient's sister did not feel that pursuing a tracheostomy, a
PEG tube and prolonged intubation were consistent with his
wishes.  As such, the patient was made DNR/DNI and was extubated
on [**3-30**].  He actually did well initially.  As such, a code
conversation was had with the sister and he was made [**Name (NI) 3225**].  He
was transferred out of the unit on [**3-31**].  He initially did well
and was able to communicate with his sister and with myself.
However, his respiratory status deteriorated.  He was given
morphine for pain and for respiratory distress.  He ultimately
passed away on [**4-2**] at 1:40 PM.  His family was at his bedside
at the time of his death.
