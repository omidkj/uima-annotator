CX: [**2157-3-15**] MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2157-3-17**]):    No MRSA isolated.

CXR:
[**2157-3-18**]: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**3-17**], the IJ
sheath has been removed.  There is continued enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with bibasilar atelectasis. Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable.
[**2157-3-14**]: Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate top
normal
cardiac size. Perihilar interstitial markings are prominent,
difficult to
assess chronicity without prior study. There are streaky
opacities in
bilateral lung bases, which could represent a combination of
mild interstitial edema and/or subsegmental atelectasis. There
is no focal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION: Minimal interstitial edema and/or trace bibasilar
subsegmental
atelectasis.

Echocardiogram: [**2157-3-15**]
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying
velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal abnormalities in mid and apical
inferolateral and inferoseptal walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS:
Intact thoracic aorta. Intact ascending aorta.
Trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) 5544**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Normal RV systolic fx.
Overall LVEF 35%. LV wall motion remains the same.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88375**] was admitted on [**2157-3-14**] for anticoagulation IV
heparin. On [**2157-3-15**] he was brought to the operating room for
Coronary artery bypass graft x3, left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to
posterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal. Maze procedure, right and left pulmonary vein Ablation
and Left atrial appendage ligation. Endoscopic harvesting of
long saphenous vein. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. Bronchoscopy was
done on [**2157-3-15**] for Right Upper lobe collapse.  He was
extubated, alert, oriented and breathing comfortably on 50% face
mask.  The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable and was weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.
Beta blocker and amiodarone were continued for atrial
fibrillation.  On POD#2 the patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes were
discontinued without complication on POD #2.  Physical Therapy
was consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility.

Respiratory: Successfully extubated POD1.  Aggressive pulmonary
toilet, nebs, incentive spirometer and ambulation were
continued. His oxygen requirements improved to 98% room air.

Cardiac: pacing wires removed [**2157-3-18**]. Coreg for systolic heart
failure EF 35% and amiodarone for chronic atrial fibrillation
were continued.  ACE was held until his blood pressure would
tolerate.  Statins continued.

GI: aggressive bowel regime and H2 blockers were continued.

Nutrition: diabetic diet continued

Renal: gently diuresed. Renal function remained within normal
limits with good urine output.  His electrolytes were replete as
needed.

Heme: Platelets trended down to 62 (base 159) HIT was negative
on [**2157-3-17**], platelets slowly recovered.  His Coumadin was
restarted on [**2157-3-16**].

Endocrine: insulin sliding scale and 75/25 Lispro were started
immediately postoperative.  Pain: IV MSO4 transitioned to PO
narcotic and acetaminophen with good control.

POD# 6 he was cleared for discharge to West [**Hospital **] Rehab and
Nursing Center. All follow up appointments were advised.
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Last Name (STitle) 6700**] will resume outpatient warfarin follow-up.

Patient is expected to be in rehabilitation <30 days
