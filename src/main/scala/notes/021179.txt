PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] catheter tip
remains at the level of the distal superior vena cava with PICC
line (midline) tubing from the right ending at the level of the
mid right subclavian vein. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits. The pulmonary vasculature is normal. The
small right pleural effusion has further decreased in size. The
osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Decreasing small right pleural effusion.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND

INDICATION: Abnormal LFTs.

through 17:

Bilateral pleural effusion, moderate on the right and small on
the left has decreased since [**9-23**]. Right basal
consolidation has also cleared aside from residual bronchial
wall thickening and minimal peribronchial infiltration
appreciated best on the lateral view. Left lung is clear. Heart
