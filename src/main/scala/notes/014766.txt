History of Present Illness:
82-year-old female with a history of HTN, Hyperthyroidism,
likely cholangiocarcinoma, recent PE/DVTs on coumadin p/w
progressive dyspnea. Patient was recently admitted for dyspnea
on [**2110-4-6**] and found to have RUL segmental branch PE on CTA. CTA
also showed a liver lesion with scattered pulmonary nodules
concerning for malignancy. Subsequent MRI showed a large
ill-defined
heterogeneous mass concerning for an intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma with multiple satellite nodules. Biopsy not
done due to need for anticoagulation for acute stage of PE. She
was seen in oncology clinic today and was felt to not be a
candidate for chemotherapy given her low performance status. She
was noted to be sob in clinic and was admitted for further
evaluation.

Notably, patient c/p progressive dyspnea since her last
admission. She felt OK initially and using supplemental oxygen
intermittently. Over the course of the past 3-4 days she has had
increasing dyspnea on exertion, where walking [**9-2**] feet caused
significant dyspnea. Once she rested, her breathing improved.
She denies cp, cough, fevers, chills N/V/D/C. She does admit to
decreased appetite, abdominal fullness, and persistent right leg
swelling. She has been taking all of her medications and her
last INR was 2.5 2 days prior, and notably has never been
subtherapeutic since starting this coumadin.

On the floor, the patient appears quite dyspneic, but after
sitting for some time, her tachypnea and dyspnea improved.
Patient states she has problems with her liver, but per her
family is not aware she has cancer. Per the family, she cannot
understand her disease process so they are trying not to tell
her to much detail.

Past Medical History:
-Lower extremity DVT
-PE anticoagulated on Coumadin
-Pulmonary nodules
-Live mass concerning for malignancy
-Hypertension
-Hypothyroidism status post thyroidectomy on levothyroxine
-Cholecystitis status post cholecystectomy
-Scoliosis
-Hypersensitivity to heparin
-H/o intracranial and cervical spinal meningioma s/p posterior
fossa decompression, C1-C2 laminectomies, tumor resection and
grafting([**2107-12-17**])

Social History:
Patient is origally from [**Country 651**]. She lives in a senior housing
apartment. She has been independent with her ADLs until recently
including cooking and grocery shopping. She has no history of
alcohol or tobacco use.

Family History:
-No family history of cancer
-No family history of liver disease

Studies:
[**2110-5-21**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion. No right ventricular
diastolic collapse or overt tampoande is seen. There is brief
right atrial diastolic invagination.  Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-7**], the pericardial effusion
appears larger. There remains no overt tamponade. The degree of
pulmonary hypertension detected has slightly increased. The
degree of AR and the LVEF are similar.

[**2110-5-24**] CXR: 1. Apparent slight increase in right pleural
effusion with predominantly
subpulmonic distribution. Persistent collapse of right middle
and right lower lobes.  2. Persistent peripheral left mid lung
opacity probably due to infarct in the setting of known
pulmonary embolism.

[**2110-5-20**] Pleural Fluid: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS consistent
with metastatic adenocarcinoma.

[**2110-5-19**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 86. Frequent atrial
premature beats. Low voltage in the standard leads. Generalized
non-specific repolarization abnormality.  Delayed precordial R
wave progression of indeterminate significance. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2110-5-2**] atrial ectopy appears somewhat more
frequent and the overall ventricular rate is marginally
increased.

[**2110-5-16**] Liver Biopsy: A.  Liver, left lobe lesion, core needle
biopsy: Adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, see note.  B.
 Liver, hilar lesion, core needle biopsy: Adenocarcinoma,
moderately differentiated, see note.  Note: Immunostains for CK7
and CK19 are positive.  CD10 is focally positive.  CD20 and
HepPar1 are negative.  CEA is non-contributory.  The
immunophenotype and morphology are consistent with a tumor of
pancreatico-biliary origin in the appropriate clinical setting.

[**2110-5-9**] CT Head:  No acute intracranial process. No evidence of
metastases or acute hemorrhage. Findings were discussed with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at 12:35 am on [**2110-5-10**].

[**2110-5-9**] CT Abdomen/Pelvis: . New pulmonary embolism within a
segmental left pulmonary artery extending to the left lower
lobe. Stable appearance of the posterior right upper lobe
segmental artery pulmonary embolism.  2. Large thrombus in the
lower infrarenal IVC extending into the proximal bilateral
common iliac veins.  3. Right common femoral, superficial
femoral, and deep femoral veins thrombosis as seen on recent
lower extremity ultrasound. This thrombus does not extend
superiorly into the right external iliac vein. Short segment of
left common femoral vein thrombus.  4. Stable appearance of
multiple nodules throughout the lungs, concerning for metastatic
disease. Stable appearance of moderately sized right pleural
effusion and adjacent compressive atelectasis. 5. Stable
appearance of known cholangiocarcinoma with intrahepatic biliary
dilatation. Stable dilatation of the common bile duct and
pancreatic duct.  6. Moderate ascites.  7. Stable pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13004**] is an 82 year old Cantonese speaking female with
history of DVT, PE, pulmonary nodules, and liver lesions
concerning for malignancy who presented with progressive dyspnea
found to have extensive thrombus burden despite therapeutic INR.

#. Dyspnea:  Likely related to her numerous and progressive PE's
in setting of therapeutic INR. Patient's right leg appeared
quite swollen on presentation and an ultrasound was performed.
This showed extensiv
