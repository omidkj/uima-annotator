HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 37202**] is a 64-year-old
male with a known history of coronary artery disease who was
recently admitted to an outside hospital due to substernal
chest pain and pressure and ultimately ruled in for a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a peak creatine
phosphokinase of 117.  The MB and troponin fractions were
unavailable at the time of this dictation.

This outside hospital admission prompted the patient to
undergo cardiac echocardiogram showing an ejection fraction
of roughly 20% to 25% with left ventricular end-diastolic
filling pressure of 21 mmHg as well as evidence of severe
3-vessel coronary artery disease by wall motion
abnormalities.  Cardiac catheterization was a "poor study."
It showed a correlated ejection fraction of 35%; and again,
3-vessel coronary artery disease.  The lesions found on
catheterization were not known at the time of this dictation.
The remainder of the information regarding the patient's
coronary arteries are outlined in detail within the patient's
Operative Note.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was evaluated at the preadmission testing clinic
on [**2184-12-2**] and was scheduled for elective coronary
artery bypass graft by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] on [**2184-12-8**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   (The patient's past medical history
was significant for)

had cardiac catheterization in [**2165**] and recently on
[**2184-11-18**].
2.  The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.
3.  History of congestive heart failure.
4.  History of hypercholesterolemia.

6.  Known coronary artery disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  He is status post tonsillectomy as a child.
2.  He had his humerus replaced in [**2181**].
3.  Status post injury to his left arm recently.
4.  His wisdom teeth were removed in the [**2142**].

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

FAMILY HISTORY:   He has a significant family history for
coronary artery disease and diabetes.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is currently retired, but was a former
PhD professor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 37203**] and multiple other universities
teaching Business and Marketing.  He has had a previous
history of tobacco as well, but quit in [**2165**].  His
cardiologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2184-12-8**], and
taken to the operating theater where Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
performed a coronary artery bypass graft times four including
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending
artery.  A right saphenous vein graft was harvested and used
as a bypass conduit to the right coronary artery posterior
descending artery, as well as the oblique marginal one and
oblique marginal three.  At the time of the operating a left
ventricular aneurysm was also found and three separate
sutures were utilized to plicate this aneurysm.  It was seen
in the anterior wall and was consistent with probable damage
that he had sustained from previous myocardial infarctions in
the [**2162**].  Her pericardium was left open at the end of the
operation.  He had an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter
used for monitoring.  Two ventricular and two atrial wires
were present, as well as having two mediastinal chest tubes,
and one left pleural tube.  His mean arterial pressure coming
off of the bypass run was 60 with a central venous pressure
of 5.  His pulmonary artery diastolic pressure was 9, with a
mean of 16.

He was sedated on propofol and being maintained on
Neo-Synephrine.  He was brought out of the operating theater
and into the Cardiothoracic Surgical Intensive Care Unit
where he was weaned on the night of surgery.  He did well and
was neurologically intact postoperatively.

Cardiovascular wise, his Neo-Synephrine was weaned from a
drip of 1 mg/kg per minute down to 0 support.  After that was
weaned he was started on aspirin.  His Lasix and Lopressor
were subsequently held for blood pressure issues.

Pulmonary wise, the patient was given chest physical therapy
and incentive spirometry.  His chest tubes remained in place.
Gastrointestinal wise, he was advanced to a diabetic/cardiac
diet.  Renal wise, he was making adequate urine.  His Foley
catheter was left in place, and he was transferred to the
floor.

On postoperative day two, the patient was ambulating with
assistance.  He had received [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consultation who
recommended utilizing a regular insulin sliding-scale until
he was started on appropriate oral feedings, at which time
they recommended utilizing Metformin 250 mg p.o. b.i.d. and
to titrate to 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. for blood sugar control.
Additionally, they recommended that the patient receive a
dilated eye examination as an outpatient.

On the floor, on postoperative day two, the patient was doing
well until he was on the commode using the bathroom; at which
time his telemetry monitor had picked up a 32-beat run of
wide complex nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  The
patient did develop syncope as a result of this.  He was
immediately brought to the bedside.  His blood pressure at
this time was 120/70.  He was back into a sinus rhythm
immediately and was able to recover his affect and
consciousness without difficulty.

At this time, the patient had his electrolytes repleted.  He
was given empiric magnesium sulfate 2 g intravenously as well
as 2 g of calcium gluconate for an ionized calcium of 1.1.
Additionally, he was given 20 mEq of K-Dur p.o. times one.
The patient was placed on Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Given the fact that he had his aneurysm plication, as well as
a low ejection fraction with documented 30%, a history of
mild mitral regurgitation, the Electrophysiology consultation
service was consulted to evaluate the patient.  They
recommended the patient be studied outside of the 96-hour
window from perfusion, as it is typical for patient's post
coronary artery bypass graft to have nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

On the same day, postoperative day two, after the
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the patient ultimately
ended up in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular
response.  His blood pressure was in the 100s to 110s
systolic.  His heart rate was 130s to 150s.  He was given
intravenous Lopressor 20 mg total over one hour which had
little effect.  He was loaded with intravenous
amiodarone 150 mg intravenously and started on an amiodarone
drip at 1 mg per hour times six hours and then changed to
0.5 mg times 18 hours.  He was ultimately transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours on postoperative day days
two through three for heart rate control.  He remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the entire time and had no
further ectopy.  He actually converted to sinus rhythm once
he was immediately transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.
However, he stayed there overnight until postoperative day
three when he was admitted back to the floor.  He was
maintained oral amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.   His Lopressor
was titrated to affect, and Electrophysiology recommended
that the patient undergo a formal study on [**2184-12-13**].

Note, during the patient's postoperative course he remained
afebrile; however, he did have an elevated white blood cell
count on postoperative day three.  His white blood cell count
to rose to 24,000.  He had no identifiable source of
infection.  He had a chest x-ray that was completed after
removal of all of his lines and tubes, and at that time there
was no focal infiltrate.  There was evidence of bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, as well as some
basilar atelectasis, left greater than right.  However, the
cardiac silhouette was stable with no evidence of effusion.
There was no pericardial friction rub noted.  He had no
