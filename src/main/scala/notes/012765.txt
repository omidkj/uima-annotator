Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 101878**] is a 63-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia,
end-stage renal disease secondary to lithium toxicity,
papillary thyroid cancer status post tracheostomy and
complicated by vocal cord paralysis and Crohn's disease who
was admitted through the Emergency Department on [**2155-10-13**], with hypotension, shortness of breath, fever and
leukocytosis.  The patient states that she had been in her
usual state of health until a few days prior to admission.
She described shortness of breath as well as some slight
increase in her baseline thick sputum production.  She denied
cough, denied night sweats, denied sick contacts.  She also
denied any other physical complaints.  Specifically, she
denied abdominal pain, no diarrhea or constipation, no
headache or visual changes, no urinary symptoms, no weakness.
On the day of admission after the patient had gone to
Hemodialysis she developed a temperature of 103 and was
subjectively short of breath.  Upon arrival to the Emergency
Department her blood pressure was 50/30 and the patient was
started on Levophed.  Her temperature at that time was 101.9
degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient's oxygenation was also
slightly decreased from baseline.  She was 96% on four liters
nasal cannula.  A chest x-ray in the Emergency Department was
negative for focal infiltrate.  There was also no evidence of
volume overload/congestive heart failure.  Blood cultures
times two sets were sent from the Emergency Department.  The
patient was also given a dose of one gram of vancomycin and
80 mg of gentamicin.  These intravenous antibiotics were
chosen for empiric coverage of sepsis and were also chosen
after consultation with Infectious Disease as the patient has
multiple drug allergies that will be listed below.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Again the patient only complained of
slightly increased shortness of breath and slightly thickened
mucus production from baseline.  She also described some
nausea but no vomiting.  Otherwise review of systems was
negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia
left lower lobe diagnosed in [**2153-10-18**].  MRSA screen in
[**2155-7-18**] during the patient's previous hospitalization was
positive.
2.  End-stage renal disease.  The patient is anuric at
baseline.  She has been on hemodialysis for 11 years.  The
end-stage renal disease is secondary to lithium toxicity.
She has a dialysis line tunneled into the left subclavian
vein.
3.  Papillary thyroid cancer status post tracheostomy that
was complicated by vocal cord paralysis.
4.  Intention tremor secondary to lithium.
5.  Osteoporosis.
6.  Crohn's disease status post ileostomy with a history of
chronic diarrhea.  Also has a history of perineal sinus
status post colectomy and a history of a perineal abscess.
7.  Basal cell carcinoma right lower extremity.
8.  History of recurrent right upper extremity arteriovenous
graft thrombosis and pseudoaneurysm formation.
9.  History of upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to
NSAIDS.
10. Hypoparathyroidism.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT:  Temperature
101.9 with a T-max of 103.  Blood pressure was 73/53 which
rose to 110/70 on Levophed and intravenous fluids.  Pulse was
113, respiratory rate 24.  Sat was initially 90% on four
liters nasal cannula which rose to 96% on four liters nasal
cannula.  In general, the patient was in no apparent
distress.  She was alert and oriented times three.  The
patient has no voice at baseline secondary to vocal cord
paralysis but is able to clearly mouth her words.  HEENT:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation,
extraocular movements intact, anicteric sclerae.  Heart:  S1,
S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation.  Abdomen was diffusely tender, greatest in the
left lower quadrant but no rebound and no guarding and
normoactive bowel sounds.  Colostomy was clean, dry and
intact with moderate amounts of stool.  Extremities:  No
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Good distal pulses.  Very warm
extremities.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  Significant for white count of
21.9.  Differential 95.7 neutrophils and 0 bands.  Hematocrit
was 43.9, platelet count 347,000.  Chemistries were within
normal limits aside from a creatinine of 3.7, baseline
creatinine [**4-24**].

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray showed no consolidation, normal
pulmonary vasculature.  Tracheostomy tube was in stable
condition.  There was minimal blunting of the left
costophrenic angle, however, this was unchanged from previous
chest x-rays.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Sinus, slightly prolonged PR interval at
210 milliseconds.  No ST changes.  No change from old
electrocardiograms.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  Patient's most recent echocardiogram was on
[**2153-6-29**], that showed a left ventricular ejection
fraction of greater than 60% and moderately dilated left
atrium and asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy of the
left ventricular apex.  This study was said to be consistent
with a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atypical variant.  P-MIBI
on [**2153-7-3**], showed no perfusion defects and, again,
hypertrophy anterior and apically of the left ventricle.

IMPRESSION:  This was a 63-year-old female with a past
medical history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
Crohn's disease status post ileostomy, history of MRSA
pneumonia, who presented with sepsis.  In particular, the
patient had hypotension, fever, leukocytosis with an
uncertain source.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Sepsis:  As stated, patient presented with hypotension,
fever and leukocytosis, thereby, by definition, sepsis.  It
was unclear on presentation the etiology of the sepsis.  Our
differential diagnosis included a pneumonia with her history
of shortness of breath, however, her initial chest x-ray was
negative.  Also in the differential was line sepsis and,
therefore, multiple blood cultures were sent.  Also in the
differential was an abdominal source with her Crohn's disease
and history of abscess.  For the workup of the sepsis sputum
cultures were sent and the chest x-ray was repeated, however,
no definite pulmonary source was found on the sputum culture.
The repeat chest x-ray was negative for infiltrate.  As far
as an abdominal source, an abdominal CT and pelvic CT was
performed on hospital day two that showed no evidence of
small bowel inflammation or obstruction nor abscess.
Clostridium difficile cultures were also sent that were
negative.  Multiple sets of blood cultures were sent that
were all negative.  The initial concern was perhaps that the
patient was septic from a hemodialysis line infection,
however, no blood cultures grew out any organisms.  The
patient was given empiric antibiotics including vancomycin to
cover for any line infection, gentamicin to cover for Gram
negative, specifically, Pseudomonas and any bowel organisms,
and Flagyl to cover for anaerobes.  By hospital day three all
cultures were negative and the patient's leukocytosis and
fever had resolved, therefore, it was decided to discontinue
gentamicin and Flagyl.  The patient was to receive vancomycin
on her day of discharge with hemodialysis and then continue
the vancomycin empirically for one week post discharge.

2.  Infectious Disease:  As above, patient was covered
empirically with vancomycin, gentamicin and levofloxacin.  No
blood
