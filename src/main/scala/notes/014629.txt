History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 88M w/ hx of CAD (100% ostial RCA occlusion, 90%
D1 stenosis), critical AS (Aortic valve peak gradient 71 mm Hg,
valve area <0.8cm2), systolic and diastolic CHF (LVEF 35%
[**3-/2173**]) and DMII, who was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital3 12748**]. He presented to OSH on [**2173-8-10**] with several
weeks of SOB. In [**Month (only) 958**], the patient had an echo and cardiac
catheterization that demonstrated critical AS and severe three
vessel disease not amenable to percutaneous intervention. It is
not clear why a revascularization procedure or valve procedure
was not brought up at that time.
.
He was recommended CABG and AVR by two cardiology consultants
during hos admission at LGH. The patient and wife were agreeable
and so he was transfered.
.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] he related that he has been having dyspnea
for months, but has gotten worse in the past few weeks. He now
gets out of breath just taking [**5-13**] steps. He has never blacked
out or passed out. He denies any chest pain now or ever. He does
have a cough, which he says is productive of occasional
white/yellow sputum. He says he has gotten pneumonia twice in
the past few months, but unclear when exact last time was. He
denies orthopenea (sleeps with one pillow at night), but does
endorse PND. He denies constipation or diarrhea. 1BM per day. He
denies any palpitations.
.
The patient denies pain, chest pain, fevers, chills.
The patient does note he has had some loose stools the past few
days, and was admitted for a pneumonia, as recently as a few
weeks ago.
.
On the floor the patient was doing well until the time of
transfer. He was being activly diuresed with IV lasix but he
initally did not make much urine in response. He was given
additional IV Lasix on the morning of transfer to the CCU.
Overnight he had been acutely desating but continually recovered
his O2 sat on his own. He was empircally covered with
Vanco/Cefepime for HCAP due to fever and respitory status.
Shortly prior to transfer to the CCU at that time he acutely
desaturated and required intubation due to inability to tolerate
the BiPAP on the floor. He was transfered to the CCU.

DISCHARGE:

STUDIES:
Echo: [**2173-8-12**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferolateral and anterior hypokinesis (multivessel CAD). The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Critical calcific aortic stenosis. Symmetric LVH
with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

.
Echo: [**2173-8-15**]
Post-AV Valvuloplasty
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35%) with regional variation
consistent with multivessel CAD. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Symmetric LVH with
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Moderately dilated RV with normal systolc function. Trivial
mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation, mild aortic
regurgitation.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2173-8-12**], LV size and function are similar. The mitral
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are less apparent, but
this could be related to sub-optimal imaging quality. The degree
of aortic regurgitation appears similar, but assessment of the
aortic valve is limited by sub-optimal imaging quality and
severity of aortic stenosis was not directly assessed.
.
CXR: [**2173-8-12**]
PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes,
likely due to low inspiratory effort.  There are bilateral
pleural effusions. Pulmonary vascular congestion is seen.  The
aorta is tortuous, and there is a prominent left pulmonary
artery seen in the left hilum.  There is nopneumothorax.
Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable
.
CT Chest: [**2173-8-12**]
1.  Patient is known with aortic stenosis and coronary artery
disease : aortic valve and coronary arteries are heavily
calcified.  The aorta is mildly dilated in its ascending portion
and is moderately calcified.  The vast majority of upper portion
of ascending aorta is not calcified.
2.  Bilateral pleural effusion with septal thickening and
ground-glass opacities are compatible with mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema.
3.  Complex right kidney cyst is not completely included in this
study.
Because it has some calcified portion, an MRI is suggested.
.
Carotid US: [**2173-8-13**]: Findings are consistent with less than 40%
stenosis bilaterally.
