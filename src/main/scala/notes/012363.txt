Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old male with a adenocarcinamatous mass in his right
neck s/p DIC.
.
On admission the patient was found to be in DIC and was bleeding
from the gums and month, he was transfused two units of FFP.
Source of the DIC was unclear and [**Name2 (NI) **]/onc was consulted, it
resolved on its own and as per [**Name2 (NI) **]/onc recs, pt was on a heparin
drip. source suspected to be sepsis or Ca.
.
In the ED, since the patient had a neck mass with tracheal
deviation, an emergent cricoidotomy was done. ENT was consulted
re conversion to trach, but this was cancelled after the patient
wanted CMO. The neck mass continued to grow clinically, however,
repeat imaging did not show enlargement of the mass. There was a
positive blood culture with Coag neg staph which was treated
with vanc and zosyn. The cancer was thought to be a reemergence
of the tounge cancer that the patient was previously txed for in
FL, the evidence of mediastinal adenopathy suggested metatasis.
A PET/CT was contemplated but the patient decided to have CMO
before the procedure could be done. [**Name2 (NI) **]/onc was onboard. Goals
of care and prognosis was disucssed with the patient and his
family before the decision to become CMO was made.
. Id was consulted in the care of the pt as well.
The patient was in afib which was resistant to rate control with
metoprolol and diltiazem.
.
The patient's blown pupil was found to be long-standing as there
was previous eye surgery done. the patient's neurologic status
was intact and he was competent.
.
PE- there was evidence of a small PE on CTA scan, patient was
stating well and this was addressed with a heparin drip and
pneumoboots.
.
Partial SBO- patient was able to pass flatus and has small BM,
this was not an active issue during the admission. the patient
was kept NPO. Maintaince was done with D5W.
.
After multiple family meetings with the HCP, his son, [**Name (NI) **],
and the girlfriend, the course of care was determined. The
patient was initially DNR/DNI. On saturday evening, the
patient's sedation was completed weaning so that he could be
competent and made a medical decision re his care. He determined
that he wanted CMO, all medications were DC'ed, including the
vent, and the patient was placed on a morphine drip titrated to
comfort.
.
The patient expired of apena and resp failure at 1812 hrs on
[**2151-8-8**]. He was pronounced by [**Name6 (MD) 78557**] [**Name8 (MD) 40583**] MD.
