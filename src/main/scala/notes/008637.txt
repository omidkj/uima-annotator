Chief Complaint:
SIRS, acute on chronic systolic heart failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation x 3
right heart catherization x 2
left heart catherization
surgical debridement of right foot ulcer
central line placement (and subsequent removal)
PICC placement

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with a PMH of DM type 2, [**Hospital3 9642**] mechanical AVR
([**2168**]), Ascending aorta repair with graft ([**2168**]), hx of VF
arrest s/p AICD [**2175**], recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE BSI s/p
removal of leads now presenting with suprapubic pain and fever.

.
The patient has a history of s/p CAD s/p three-vessel bypass
surgery and mechanical AVR in [**4-/2169**], with multiple subsequent
coronary interventions underwent a biventricular ICD
implantation [**2176-7-19**] after a VF arrest for which he underwent
evaluation at [**Hospital6 1129**]. He then sustained
an MRSA AICD pocket infection and it was explanted on [**2176-8-22**].
After one month treatment with IV vancomycin, he underwent a
second ICD implantation on [**2176-10-25**].
.
He was then admitted [**2-2**] with high grade CoNS BSI of unclear
source. At that time had a negative TTE/TEE. He was dishcarged
on vancomycin for a planned 4 week course given a hematoma was
found around ICD. He was then readmitted [**Date range (1) 100253**] with
recurrent high grade CoNS and VRE bacteremia while on 5th week
of Vancomycin with adequate troughs. TEE and CT chest were
unremarkable. ICD leads X 3 were removed on [**2178-3-26**].
.
He was then admitted [**6-5**] with a pseudomonas UTI and was treated
with cefepime for 14 day course ended on [**6-22**]. He was also found
to have ascending colitis on CT scan of unclear etiology,
thought secondary to ileus and was improved with conservative
management.
.
The patient was again admitted [**Date range (1) 100254**] for an elective surgical
debridement of R lateral foot chronic ulcer by vascular service.
He was not evaluated by ID at this time. Gangrene ulcer was
debrided on
[**6-29**] with a fifth metatarsal head resection. Wound vac was
placed. No bone specimen were sent to path or micro. Tissue
revealed 3+PMNs and culture grew out proteus and MRSA. Pt was
discharged to
complete 14 days of Zosyn.
.
He was seen in follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**7-29**]. Further
antibiotics were held given it was felt good tissue margins were
obtained intraoperatively.
.
The patient presents now with complaints of 1 day of suprapubic
pain and fever. The patient reports a 4 day history of
constipation. He then passed a large BM and subsequently
developed suprapubic pain. Denies diarrhea. Denies
melena/hematochezia. Denies dysuria. No chronic foley. Denies
CP/SOB. Reports chronic cough, minimally productive. His
suprapubic pain persisted and he presented to the ED.
.
In the ED, intial vitals: T 100.2, HR 99, BP 102/59, RR 16, O2
99% on RA. He had emesis X3 without evidence of blood. UA with
WBC >50, Leuks Mod, Nit Pos, Bact few. WBC 19 and lactate 2.1.
He was given vancomycin 1gm IV and Zosyn 4.5g IV. SBP dropped to
80s systolic and he was given 1L NS with improvement in BP to
97/52. Blood cultures sent. CXR demonstrated no acute process.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient is resting comfortably.
Denies current pain. Denies CP/SOB.

RADIOLOGY:
CXR [**2178-8-17**]:
.
TEE [**2178-3-26**] - The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe hypokinesis of the inferior, lateral, and septal walls
with somewhat better function of the anterior and anteroseptal
walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is about 25 to
30%. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aortic graft is poorly seen. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic
