HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
gentleman with a past medical history of syringomyelia with
residual left hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease on home oxygen.  He presents
from an outside hospital after two days of worsening
shortness of breath. By report, the patient had stopped his
Lasix two weeks prior to admission to the outside hospital
and had begun home oxygen around the clock instead of at
night only.

On admission to the outside hospital, he was found to have a
collapse of the left lung, initially thought secondary to
mucus plugging, since he did improve with suctioning at that
time.  On [**2101-11-17**], the patient was diagnosed with a right
lower lobe pneumonia at the outside hospital and started
empirically on Vancomycin and Zosyn.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit there for respiratory
failure on [**2101-11-21**] and intubated at that time.  Bronchoscopy
was performed on [**11-22**] which found a mass in the left medial
basilar lobe, with intrinsic compression of other bronchi.
Biopsy done on that lesion came back as collagen, with a
question of possible chondroma or bronchial cartilage.  The
patient was transferred to our hospital for a possible
endobronchial intervention by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

On receiving the patient from the outside hospital, he was
alert and responsive to voice.  He was in restraints but
denied any pain or discomfort.  He was resting comfortably on
the vent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Other past medical history of peptic
ulcer disease, complicated by gastrointestinal bleeds.  He
has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
Zosyn 3.375 grams q. 8 hours, day 15.
Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q. day.
Theophylline 50 mg p.o. four times a day.
Albuterol.
Reglan.
Celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day.
Timolol eye drops.
Xalatan eye drops.
Dulcolax.
Milk of Magnesia prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Lives at home with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was
afebrile; blood pressure 101/65; heart rate of 65;
respirations of 20; saturating 93% on the vent.  In general,
he was alert and appeared comfortable. He had dry oral
membranes.  His neck was supple.  Cardiovascular examination
noted a normal S1 and S2, with no murmurs.  His lungs were
clear on the right.  He had decreased breath sounds at the
left base.  Abdomen had positive bowel sounds, was soft and
nontender.  Extremities:  Warm and without edema.  Left upper
extremity was somewhat atrophic with 1/5 strength.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 9.9; hematocrit was 29.8;
platelets were 392.  Sodium was 139; potassium was 4.1;
chloride 100; bicarbonate was 35; BUN was 9; creatinine .6;
glucose 115.  Liver function tests were all within normal
limits.  Calcium, magnesium and phosphorus were all normal.

Chest x-ray showed complete white-out of the left lung.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with frequent premature
atrial contractions.  Rate was 65.  He had a left axis
deviation and early R wave progression but no acute ST or T
wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  78 year old gentleman with left
hemi-diaphragmatic paralysis secondary to syringomyelia and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, transferred from an
outside hospital for further work-up and management of
possible endobronchial lesion and left lung collapse.

On hospital day number three, a rigid bronchoscopy was
performed in the operating room which showed a distal lesion
with granulation; question of a possible foreign body.  An
attempt at biopsy was aborted secondary to heavy bleeding.

A rigid bronchoscopy was repeated on hospital day number five
and a successful biopsy of the lesion was obtained and sent
to pathology for further review. In terms of the patient's
questionable pneumonia status, the patient had received 15
days of Zosyn at the outside hospital and it was felt that
the patient did not currently have a pneumonia; thus, the
Zosyn was discontinued on admission to our hospital.

In terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the
patient was on a vent and got nebs and inhalers as needed. In
terms of his hematologic status, the patient received two
units of packed red blood cells on hospital day number six,
after he had dropped his hematocrit.  This was after the
second bronchoscopy and he dropped his hematocrit to 20. His
hematocrit following the two units increased to 35.  He
remained stable.

In terms of his cardiovascular status, he had no known heart
dysfunction and that remained stable.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient had a tracheostomy
performed on hospital day number six, along with a second
rigid bronchoscopy.  The patient was weaned off the
ventilator for approximately two hours on hospital day number
seven. He tolerated that well.  The patient was placed back
onto the ventilator, secondary to some desaturations into the
high 80's, however, his respiratory rate remained at around
20.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Back to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 805**] Hospital.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
