_____

History of Present Illness:
82M with multiple medical comorbidities s/p sigmoid colectomy
with end transverse [**Hospital 47427**] transfered from OSH for further
management of a retroperitoneal abscess.  Pt initially presented
from his nursing home to [**Hospital3 **] [**2103-5-4**] with fever to
102.6 and increasing leukocytosis. He was found to be
hypotensive
to SBP 85, which improved with resuscitation, and WBC 33.  CXR
revealed a LLL pneumonia and UA was consistent with a UTI, for
which he was started on empiric Vanc/Zosyn and admitted to the
ICU.  He underwent CT A/P which was interpreted as showing left
hydronephrosis with a 16x10x8cm peri-nephric / retroperitoneal
abscess with air, along with a LLL pneumonia.  Given the lack of
interventional radiology capabilities at the OSH, the pt was
directly transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] TSICU for anticipated percutaneous
drainage pf the per-nephric abscess.

Imaging:

CT A/P (OSH [**2103-5-6**]):
1. Obstructed left kidney with a large perirenal/RP abscess
(16x10x8cm) with air, involving psoas muscle and extending to
the
lower pelvis to just above the acetabulum.
2. RLL consolidation with air bronchograms
3. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta
without aneurysm
4. Aneurysmal dilitationof the common left iliac artery with the
lumen narrowed.
5. Bladder calculi


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 M  who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **]
[**2103-5-4**] with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension found to have
16x10x8cm peri-nephric / retroperitoneal fluid collection and
pneumonia he was started on vancomycin and zosyn and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] surgery service for further management
.
#PSOAS / PERINEPHRIC ABSCESS: The etiology was unclear although
most likely from complication of GU infection in patient with
chronic indwellling foley catheter. He was initially admitted to
surgery service but was not a surgical candidate. Patient
underwent IR guided drainage on [**2103-5-8**] with removal of 400cc of
fluid resulting in partial decompression of hydronephrosis.
There was evidence that the collecting system was communicating
with the fluid collection during the procedure. Subsequently
fluid from the drain was found to have elevated creatinine c/w
urine. Likely he developed GU infection with nephric/ureter
abscess with loss of collecting system integrity and spread to
perinephric/psoas. Unclear if calculi (bladder calculi seen on
imaging) or ureter mass (not found on imaging) predisposed to
rupture. He was startd on vancomycin and zosyn. Urine culture
and fluid collection culture returned with no growth (although
had already been on antibiotics for several days. Urine and
drain cytology returned without evidence of malignant cells.
Infectious disease was consulted. Repeat abdominal imaging on
[**5-15**] showed a well placed drain and signficant improvement in
fluid collection. Plan for percutaneous nephrostomy tube and
eventual removal of abdominal drain was was discussed with the
son [**Name (NI) 382**].  However, the patient continued to slowly decline and
there was concern about his ability to tolerate the procedure
and whether it was consistent with his overall goals of care
given his poor overall prognosis. In coordination with the son,
it was decided to not pursue further procedures, such as
nephrostomy tube placement. At [**Doctor First Name 391**] Bay, in discussion with
the son, if the abdominal drain were to accidentally come out
the, then he would not be rehospitalized to replace it. Zosyn
was stopped on [**2103-5-17**] as, in consultation with the son, it was
felt to not aid in patient comfort.
.
#HYPERNATREMIA: Patient's sodium was 137 at OSH and on admission
to [**Hospital1 18**] was found to be 154. The most likely etiology is
over-resuscitation with normal saline in setting of reduced
access to free H20.  His sodium continued to remain slighly
elevated in the setting of decreased access to free water. He
was given D5W at a rate of 75-125cc/hr while he was NPO. Per
discussion with the son, he wants to continue the PICC line and
continue D5W (rate of 75cc/hr) for hydration at this time to
have family members the opportunity to come in this weekend and
see the patient.
.
#HCAP: Patient is nursing home resident found to have fever,
increased secretions and cough, and radiographic evidence with
opacity in the right lung base of pneumonia with differential
icluding aspiration vs HCAP. During his hospital stay he was
noted to have a weak cough with difficulty managing secretions.
He completed an 8 day course of vanc/zosyn on [**5-15**]. Legionella
negative.
.
#NUTRITION: The patient has failed several speech/swallow
evaluations and was determined to be high risk of aspiration.
This was discussed with the HCP, who was not interested in NG
tube placement. We held off on oral nutrition initially in the
hope that his condition may improve. At discharge, the risk of
aspiration was again addressed with the HCP and the options to
either continue NPO status or have the patient be allowed to
have nectar thick liquids for comfort if he verbalizes. The HCP
felt that it could be ok for him to eat/drink for comfort
knowing that this might lead to the patient's demise. Please
continue aspiration precautions.
.
#RUE SWELLING: He was found to have a PICC associated
non-occlusive subacute-to-chronic right subclavian thrombus.
PICC functining appropriately. He was discharged with the PICC
line given his healthcare proxy wanted the pt to continue
hydration during the weekend so family could come and see him.
.
#HEMATOCRIT DROP: His hematocrit trended down on [**5-16**] from mid
twenties to 18. He was transfused four units of blood with
improvement up to 26. His hematocrit trended down to 23 on [**5-17**]
and he was given another unit of blood. The etiology of blood
loss was unclear. GI bleed considered, particularly stress
ulcer, although no melana or bright red blood in ostomy. He was
evaluated by the GI service.  RP bleed considered but CT abdomen
negative. No evidence of hemolysis on labs.
.
GOALS OF CARE: Addressed with [**Doctor Last Name **], the healthcare proxy,
[**Name (NI) 6028**] the hospitalization. We discussed that even with
standard medical care in this situation that he has a poor
prognosis. The HCP informed us that his father would not want
extraordinary measures and would want to focus more on comfort
in this situation. [**Doctor Last Name **] agreed with stopping antibiotics at
discharge, as well as no additional transfusions, or further lab
testing, or re-hospitalization. If the abdominal drain were to
