Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22401**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer to MICU from OSH s/p intubation and status epilepticus

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old man with past medical history significant
for Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ETOH abuse and psoriasis who
presented to OSH in status epilepticus and then transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Apparently, patient was found
unresponsive and so EMS was called. He was found to be in status
epilepticus (several witnessed seizures, +tongue biting) but due
to the cluttered nature of his house, it took a long time to get
[**Last Name (un) **] out. He was taken to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital. He was
given ativan and his seizures stopped. He also received
ceftriaxone. For unclear reasons that were not documented
(possibly airway protection), patient was induced with propofol
and intubated after attempting to obtain a head CT.
.
Of note, patient had been recently discharged from [**Hospital1 2025**] on
[**2201-5-17**] for a question of seizure and transient neurologic
symptoms. He had been admitted to the neurology service for long
term monitoring and the EEG showed no epileptic seizures. Per
family report, the patient was having seizures at home ([**4-30**]
times in the past occasionally requiring hospitalizations).

Patient was transported to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and
management. In the ED, patient was febrile to 101.6 with normal
CXR and WBC. Neurology was consulted and felt seizure could be
secondary to either ETOH withdrawal vs seizure disorder from
non-med complaince vs infectious.  Patient's dilantin level was
noted to be low and so he was given a loading dose. Patient was
seizure free while in the ED.

Past Medical History:
1. Hepatitis C cirrhosis w/esophageal varices (Followed by
heptatologist at [**Hospital1 2025**])
2. ETOH abuse
3. Psoriasis
4. Hypothyroidism
5. Seizure disorder, generalized tonic/clonic and complex
partial in setting ETOH withdrawal (Followed by neurologist at
[**Hospital1 2025**])
6. Hydrocephalus, unclear etiology
7. ? CHF


Social History:
NOTE: social history and family history obtained post-extubation
Patient report having difficulty with binge drinking ETOH. Last
binge occurred last weekend [**Date range (1) 25243**]. Denies tobacco or drug
use. He is unemployed and had been an engineer. His brother and
father live nearby.

Family History:
Mother died of MI at age 68. Brother has DM.

Imaging:
[**5-25**]: IR guided LP - Successful fluoro guided lumbar puncture.
Samples were sent for routine laboratory analysis as requested
by the referring physician
.
[**5-23**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): An endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm
above the carina. The nasogastric tube tip is not visualized but
is below the diaphragm. The patient is supine, rotated, with low
lung volumes. Therefore, the cardiac and mediastinal contours
are difficult to assess. The lungs are grossly clear. No clear
pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are identified.
Appropriately placed endotracheal tube.
.
[**5-23**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST - No intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect. Involutional change of the brain, which is prominent for
a person of this age.
.
[**5-23**]: ABDOMEN U.S.(PORTABLE) - Four quadrants were evaluated
for presence of ascites, which was not identified. Therefore, no
suitable spot was marked for paracentesis.
.
EKG: NSR @ 79, nl axis, no ST changes

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course: Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] while intubated
and sedated. He was found to be febrile in the ED to 101.6,
afebrile on admission to MICU. He did not have a leukocytosis.
His phenytoin level was 5.8 (low). He was continued on dilantin,
his dose was increased per neurology, and started on keppra.
Paitent's seizure was felt to be either due to infection, being
subtherapeutic on AEDs, or EtOH withdrawal. He was changed from
AC to PSV, had failed LP attempts x 3, and was continued on
vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone. He remained afebrile
and was been successfully extubated. He had some residual MS
changes / post-ictal confusion. Patient also was
thrombocytopenic and anemic which was thought to be due to
alcoholism. He had a mild transaminitis, c/w alcoholism and
chronic hep C.
.
On review of systems post extubation, patient felt confused with
"lack of memory." He denied pain, stiff neck, difficulty
breathing, cough, dysuria.

Briefly, 52 year old man with past medical history significant
for hepatitis C cirrhosis, etoh abuse, psoriasis who presents
from OSH intubated and s/p status epilepticus.
.
## Seizures - Differential diagnosis for seizures included
infectious etiology such as meningitis, non-complaince with
medication as dilantin level low, or possible etoh withdrawal.
Unclear what resulted from the recent neurologic/seizure work-up
that was performed at [**Hospital1 2025**]. Regardless, patient's outpatient
neurologist was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed that patient should be on
both dilantin and keppra for prevention of seizure and that ETOH
withdrawal was also a possibility.
.
Due to subtherapeutic levels, patient got Dilantin 500mg in ED
and his dilantin dose was titrated up to achieve a goal level
between 15 to 20. Keppra was also continued. Head CT was
negative for intracranial hemorrhage or mass. Several attempts
were made at a lumbar puncture on initial admission to the MICU
but were unsuccessful. Patient subsequently underwent
fluoro-guided lumbar puncture post-extubation, a few days after
he was started on empiric antibiotics. Patient was initally
treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin which were
discontinued once the gram stain of the CSF was negative and
since patient's mental status had improved dramatically. It was
agreed by neurology given the absence of white blood cells and
micro-organisms in the CSF and how well the patient looked that
bacterial meningitis was very unlikely. Patient was also kept on
a CIWA scale with PRN valium (watching to avoid hepatotoxicity).
At time of discharge, patient was not requiring coverage with
CIWA scale and patient's dilantin level was 16.2. Patient was
seizure free throughout the hospital course.
.
## Fever - Most likely secondary to seizures. CXR negative and
pt without elevated WBC. Urinanalysis and urine culture were
negative. Lumbar puncture was performed as above. Abdominal US
was negative for ascites.
.
## Hepatitis C cirrhosis - Slight transaminitis and elevated
bilirubin which remained stable throughout hospital course.
Patient had a benign abdominal exam. Continued aldactone and
