Pertinent Results:
[**2188-2-13**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. The apical anterior and anteroseptal
wall segments are thinned and akinetic. The apex is also
akinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). A large globular thrombus
is seen in the apex of the left ventricle, measuring 1.5cm x
1.7cm. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: The LV thrombus is no longer seen. The LV continues to
have regional wall motion abnormalities as described pre-bypass.
The estimated EF is 40-45%. The RV systolic function is normal.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

[**2188-2-13**] Carotid U/S: Limited study particularly of the right
carotid due to the central line but no evidence of stenosis seen
bilaterally.

[**2188-2-14**] CTA: 1. Thrombus in mid-to-distal right below-knee
popliteal artery extending into the proximal right anterior
tibial artery and filling the entire right common
tibial-peroneal trunk. Multiple filling defects in right
posterior tibial and peroneal arteries. Multiple filling defects
in left anterior tibial artery and diminutive flow in the left
distal peroneal artery. 2. Bilateral small pleural effusions and
adjacent opacities at the lung bases, likely atelectasis.
Patient is status post CABG with air within the mediastinum
post-surgical. 3. Ventral abdominal wall hernia with loops of
bowel; however, no stranding and no evidence of bowel
obstruction. 4. Colonic diverticulosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Was admitted to same day surgery and was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 2. Please see operative report for surgical details, of note
there was LV thrombus noted on TEE seen at start of case, not
present after bypass.  He had dopplerable pulses in both groins
and both extremities in the OR and following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. He underwent an urgent carotid duplex to further
examine for thrombus which was negative. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Shortly after extubation there was a loss of Doppler signals in
his right lower extremity both DP and PT. Vascular surgery was
immediately consulted and he underwent a CTA which showed a
thrombus in mid-to-distal right below-knee popliteal artery
extending into the proximal right anterior tibial artery and
filling the entire right common tibial-peroneal trunk. He was
then brought to the operating room where he underwent a right
popliteal/tibial artery embolectomy. Following surgery he was
again transferred back to the CVICU. Heparin was started and
later that day he was weaned from sedation and extubated without
incident. Beta blockers and diuretics were started and he was
gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day two he
was transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He
continued to make good progress while working with physical
therapy for strength and mobility.  He was initiated on coumadin
for LV thrombus and right leg thrombosis.  He was ready for
discharge home with services on [**2188-2-18**].  He was unable to be
started on ace inhibitor due to blood pressure and needs to be
considered as an outpatient.
