Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
52M with h/o non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%),
COPD, who presents with shortness of breath, worsening acutely
today while at home, but getting progressively worse since [**2-13**].
 PT also reports malaise for the past couple of days, without
fevers but with chills, no nausea or vomiting.  He does report
some diffuse chest tightness in association with his acute
dyspnea.  The pain does not radiate and has resolved somewhat
with oxygen therapy.  He reports cough productive of yellowish
white sputum over the last three days.  There have been no other
upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient has history of similar
episodes of dyspnea, usually after smoking crack cocaine, but
reports that this time he was not.  His last reported crack
cocaine use was five days prior to admission (Thursday).  When
EMS found him, he was found to 70% on RA with SBPs in 120s,
respiratory rate about 40.  He was placed on a non-rebreather
and transported to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] and discharged on [**2195-2-3**]
for acute respiratory decompensation and bilateral lung
opacifications requiring ICU admission, thought to be due to
acute crack inhalation lung injury.  He was admitted to the MICU
for respiratory monitoring and required a period of BiPAP use
with improvement with symptomatic treatment, namely nebulizers
and agressive respiratory therapy.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 99.0 116 123/66 40 96% nr. Patient
had JVD while sitting upright, and lung sounds with rales in
bases.  He was tachycardic to the 140-150, with O2 saturations
88% on NRB, with supraclavicular retractions.  ECG was
consistent with prior with no ST or T-wave changes.  CXR was
performed and significant for new alveolar opacities suspicious
for pulmonary edema.  He was placed on a nitro gtt and BIPAP,
and administered furosemide 40 mg IV x 1, urine output was not
recorded.  Labs were significant for initial venous blood gas of
7.29/53/45/27.  Troponin was 0.03.  BNP was measured at 8381.
There was leukocytosis with WBC count. 13.1 with 80%
neutrophils.  Arterial blood gas after being on BIPAP was
7.45/35/63/25.   On transfer, VS were 103, 118/66, rr34 100% on
50% CPAP 5+5, nitro gtt @ 0.667.  There are two 20g peripheral
IVs in place.  He has put out about 1.3 liters of urine after
receiving his dose of Lasix.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools.  He denies recent fevers or rigors.  He
does report some chills.  He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain.  All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING:
PLEASE ADD FINAL REPORT OF CT

Brief Hospital Course:
52M with h/o non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (LVEF 20%),
COPD, presenting with acute respiratory decompensation.

# Hypoxia secondary to crack pneumonitis: Patient presents with
acute respiratory decompensation, over the course of hours,
associated with hypoxemia, with bilateral opacifications in the
bilateral lung fields consistent with likely pulmonary edema and
pneumonitis/pneumonia.  In the past, patient has had similar
presentations, usually following crack cocaine use, thought to
be due to acute crack lung inhalation injury.  His most recent
reported crack cocaine use was five days prior to admission, and
his symptoms of dyspnea started 3 days prior to admission, which
is consistent with crack cocaine pneumonitis.  Patient also had
elevated JVP, rales on lung exam, and imaging suggestive of
fluid overload, making CHF exacerbation a likely diagnosis.  The
patient was aggresively diuresis 4.5 litter over the next 36
hours until his creatinine bumped and he was at his dry weight.
His respiratory status did NOT marketly improved  with diuresis
(continue to require 50-100% O2 by face mask) and pulmonary was
consulted.  Per pulmonary, the patient's clinical presentation
was most consistent with crack cocaine pneumonitis, but an
atypical penumonia could not be ruled out.  He was started on
levofloxacin on [**2-16**] for a 7 day course.  He was also started on
solumedrol 60mg q6 hours and was tappered to oral prednisone and
stopped 2 days prior to discharge.  The patient's oxygen
requirement decreased and was weaned off oxygen. A repeat chest
x-ray showed marked improvement in his lung fields. Patient was
discharged with a normal ambulatory oxygen saturation.

# Acute systolic congestive heart failure, non-ischemic dilated
cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of LVEF 20%.  Despite
his clinical presentation (see above), the patient reported
taking his medication faithfully without dietary indiscretions.
Given his clinical presenation, the patient was given lasix 40mg
IV and started on an lasix gtt.  The patient was aggresively
diuresis 4.5 litter over the next 36 hours until his creatinine
bumped and he was at his dry weight.  His home medications were
intially held.  He was initally started on Captopril 6.25 mg
TID.  On the floor the pat
