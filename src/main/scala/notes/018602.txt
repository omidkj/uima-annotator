PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs revealed blood pressure
110/palpable ranging to 129/107, temperature 98.9, heart rate
69 to 97, oxygen saturation 91 to 97% in room air.  The
patient was awake and alert, GCS 15, with a head laceration.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart

nondistended.  The pelvis was stable.  Rectal examination was
normal tone, no blood.  Skin noted with a road rash right
abdomen, right thigh, normal shoulder, arm.  Extremities
noted with a degloving injury above the right elbow, no clear
fractures.  Below the left elbow, there is a bump 2.0 by 5.0
centimeters on the forearm.  According to the patient, it is
chronic.  The patient does not know the cause of the finding.
There are +2 radial pulses.  On the right leg, partial
amputation at the level of the ankle on the right foot.
Dorsalis pedis seen pulsating.  Posterior tibial pulses were
palpable bilaterally.  The patient can move his toes and has
sensation over the foot on the right.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 9.8, hematocrit
39.9, platelet count 273,000.  Prothrombin time 12.7, partial
thromboplastin time 24.9, INR 1.1.  Fibrinogen 218.
Urinalysis was negative.  Sodium 143, potassium 4.1, chloride

glucose 140, amylase 55.  Arterial blood gases revealed pH
7.43, pCO2 35, paO2 156, bicarbonate 24, base excess 0.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  CT of the abdomen was negative.  CT of
the chest noted minimal atelectasis over the right.  Cervical
spine plain films were not taken.  Right elbow shows a medial
epicondyle fracture.  Right knee films - no fractures.  Right
tibia fibula shows a comminuted oblique fracture of the
fibula.  Right ankle and foot films show the tibia fibula
completely disconnected from the foot.  On the right ankle,
there are multiple fractures including the fibula but no
tibia fractures.  First metatarsal fracture of the intrinsic
bones of the foot were also noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Orthopedics was consulted regarding the
patient's partial amputation and degloving injury.  Initial
attempt of orthopedic surgery was to take the patient to the
operating room for an attempt to save the right foot and also
for washout of the right elbow degloving injury.  There was a
traumatic disruption of the right ulnar nerve.   Therefore,
an incision and drainage of the ankle foot crush with
application of X-fix was tried.  Incision and drainage, open
reduction and internal fixation of the right elbow fracture
was also performed.  Plastic surgery was consulted via
telephone and plastics and vascular surgery were consulted
regarding the assessment of salvageability of the right foot.
 In the meantime, the patient was admitted under Trauma
Surgery service into the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.,

The patient was maintained on sedation with Propofol as well
as pain control with Morphine Sulfate initially in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was extubated on
[**2199-6-30**], in the morning.  The patient was made NPO, and
Protonix was started for gastrointestinal ulcer prophylaxis.
Hematocrit was followed and regular insulin sliding scale was
instituted for the patient's blood sugar fluctuations.

On [**2199-7-1**], orthopedics requested vascular surgery
consultation regarding the patient's salvageability of the
right foot.  It was discussed with Trauma.  On [**2199-7-1**], a
central venous line was placed in preparation for the
surgery.  Vascular surgery saw the patient on [**2199-7-1**].
Thoracic and lumbar spine films performed on [**2199-7-1**], were
negative.  A pulmonary artery line was put in the patient on
[**2199-7-2**] and the patient was started on tube feeds.  On
[**2199-7-2**], the patient had an incision and drainage of the
right foot by orthopedic and noted that the right foot was
compromised given soft tissue, bony and vascular injuries.
Therefore, the patient would need primary amputation and
therefore it was felt per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] that this was the
patient's best option.

On [**2199-7-3**], the patient was noted to have respiratory
failure with decreasing saturation.  Chest x-ray was obtained
which showed bilateral infiltrates consistent with adult
respiratory distress syndrome, but no pulmonary embolus was
noted.  It was agreed per vascular surgery, orthopedic
surgery as well as plastic surgery that a right below the
knee amputation of the patient would be the best option.

Right below the knee amputation was performed on [**2199-7-6**],
done by vascular surgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Postoperatively, the
patient was continued on ventilator support, one unit of red
blood cells was transfused postoperatively.  The patient was
started on Vancomycin and Gentamicin as well as Ceftazidime.
Morphine Sulfate was given for postoperative pain control.
The most likely etiology due to pneumonia, sepsis related.
The patient was continued with antibiotic treatment.  On
[**2199-7-8**], Ceftazidime was changed to Ceftriaxone.  The
patient was continued on Vancomycin and Gentamicin.

The patient was followed daily by the vascular surgery, as
well as orthopedic surgery staff.  Dressing changes were
daily.  Per nutrition, the patient had TPN as well as tube
feeds implemented for the patient's nutrition and diet.  On
[**2199-7-9**], the patient had TPN discontinued but continued on
tube feeds.  On [**2199-7-10**], cultures of the sputum grew
positive for Serratia as well as Streptococcus pneumonia.  On
[**2199-7-10**], the patient's Vancomycin, Gentamicin and
Ceftriaxone were continued although there was consideration
on whether to change the antibiotic regimen in light of the
new sputum culture results.  On [**2199-7-13**], the patient again
extubated.  The patient's Morphine Sulfate was decreased and
interval was increased between doses.  Chest physical therapy
was continued.  On [**2199-7-14**], Vancomycin was discontinued, and
Gentamicin and Ceftriaxone were continued.  On [**2199-7-16**], the
patient's Ceftriaxone was discontinued.  The patient was
transferred to the floor on [**2199-7-16**], as well, having made
very significant improvements in the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit.

On [**2199-7-16**], case manager was consulted to start
rehabilitation screening for the patient since per physical
therapy, the patient would not be able to be discharged home
immediately due to disposition.  Case manager spoke with the
patient who prefers [**Hospital3 **].  Orthopedics
was following and on [**2199-7-16**], did note that the patient had
an ulnar nerve palsy, and noted plastic surgery would repair
the ulnar nerve in two to three weeks after discharge.

On [**2199-7-17**], the patient had splints removed.  The patient
needed a cast now that would allow weight-bearing as
tolerated on a platform crutch.  The patient's tube feed was
discontinued on [**2199-7-17**], and diet was converted to house
diet with supplemented protein shakes, which the patient
initially had a question of toleration, question of
aspiration, but upon further examination of the patient while
eating, in conjunction with calorie counts that were started
on behalf of nutrition consultation, the patient appeared to
be doing well and improving p.o. intake during the rest of
hospital stay.

On [**2199-7-18**], a psychiatric consultation was suggested.  The
patient was continued on calorie counts.  The patient was
also seen by psychiatry on [**2199-7-18**].  Their impression was
that the patient had resolving
