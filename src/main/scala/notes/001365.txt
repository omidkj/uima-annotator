Micro:
Blood cultures pending x2

CHEST (PORTABLE AP): IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary
process. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
[**1-7**] EKG:
Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response rate.
Intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block
morphology.
Probable prior inferior myocardial infarction. T wave inversions
in the
lateral and high lateral leads consistent with possible
ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2183-1-7**] the
findings are similar.
.
EKG [**1-7**]:
Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response. Left axis
deviation.
Intraventricular conduction delay of left bundle-branch block
type. Since the previous tracing of [**2176-6-6**] the rate is slower.
QRS voltage is more prominent in the limb leads. ST-T wave
abnormalities may be more prominent. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2183-1-7**] 1:41 PM
There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass
effect,
or new infarction. There is slit-like encephalomalacia in the
region of the right basal ganglia suggesting prior hemorrhage
with ex vacuo dilitation of the rigth lateral ventricle.
Prominent periventricular white matter hypodensities are seen,
most commonly due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The
basal cisterns appear patent and there is preservation of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation elsewhere.
No fracture is identified. The paranasal sinuses, mastoid air
cells and
middle ear cavities are clear. No facial or cranial soft tissue
abnormalities are present.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. Slit-like encephalomalacia in the area of the right basal
ganglia is
suggestive of prior hemorrhage.
3. White matter hypodensities most commonly due to chronic small
vessel
ischemic disease.
.
ECHO [**1-8**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 20-25%). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25%). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis with severely depressed systolic
function (EF 20-25%). Normal right ventricular size with mild
right ventricular hypokinesis. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.
Mild mitral regurgitation

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77-year-old male with a history of systolic CHF with EF of
20%, atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, COPD, CAD who was admitted
to the MICU [**1-7**] with hypotension thought to be due to
hypovolemia now resolved after iv hydration.
.
#Hypotension: likely hypovolemia due to dehydration from
diuretic use and drinking of ETOH at home. Pt did not have any
infectious symptoms such as fever, leukocytosis or other
localizing symptoms. Hypotension resolved with 2L IVF. EKG not
suggestive of ischemia and cardiac enzymes were negative. TSH
and cortisol not pursued as pt's symptoms resolved after IV
fluids. However, BP still ranged at times from high 90's-110's
and pt was asymptom
