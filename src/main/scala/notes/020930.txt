History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90564**] is a 67 year-old Spanish-speaking male with history
of sCHF (EF of 20% as per OHS report), HTN who presented to an
OSH with leg pain, and abdominal pain and was found to have [**Last Name (un) **]
and acidosis. He states that his leg pain has been ongoing for
the last several years, but worsening in the last few weeks. He
has been taking on average 12 ibuprofen and ASA for his pain for
several years and in the last 3 days he was several tablets per
day without much resolution of his symptoms. Yesterday he felt
worse to the point that he came to the ED at [**Hospital3 15402**]. He
initially had US of his LE as per report it was negative. He
labs and was found to have a Cr of 7.1, ASA level of 15.9, and
bicarb of 8. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent HD.
.
In the BIMDC ED, his initial VS were 97.5 76 116/53 28 97%. He
remained tachypneic and repeat labs which showed low bicarb of
6, BUN 91/Creatine of 7.8. Serum Osms:292 UricA:15.2/VBG was pH
7.23/ pCO2
18/ pO2 80/ HCO3 8. His ASA level was 15 and there was concern
for aspirin intoxication, toxicoloy was consulted and
recommended giving fomepizole, although they thought this was
less likely to be due to true intoxication giving levels. Renal
consult was also called. He was given 1L of NS, and D50 (for
hypoglycemia) and admitted to the [**Hospital1 12145**].
.
Currently he is very drowsy, but responsive.  Ox 3. Jaundice
with increase in resp rate to 30s. He denies having any pain or
discomfort, able to answer most questions appropriately. Renal
is present to place HD line. He was given 2gm of calcium
gluconate (freeCa:0.75) and 1 amp of bicarb (bicarb of 11).

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI, + nausea, generalized body aches and pain.
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias. All
other review of systems are negative.

IMAGING:
Brain MRI
IMPRESSION: Multiple FLAIR and T2 hyperintense lesions in
bilateral frontal and parietal periventricular white matter and
right cerebellar hemisphere showing slow diffusion. The etiology
of the lesions is unclear and the location of the lesions is
unusual for septic emboli. Consider the possibility of
vasculitis perhaps in combination with hypotension leading to
infarction.

Abdominal MRI:
IMPRESSION:
1. Non-occlusive non-circumferential plaque projecting into the
lumen of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Findings favor
ulcerated plaque versus chronic penetrating ulcer, possibly with
hemorrhage within the wall of the aorta. No definite vasculitis.

If clinical suspicion for for ongoing infection within this
region, then a
radionuclide-labeled white cell scan may be helpful.
2. New splenic lesions concerning for either septic emboli or
areas of
infarction.
3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
'
CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Compared to the prior study, there has been further
progression of dense consolidation in both lower lobes. Findings
are consistent with ARDS.
2. New multiple low-attenuation splenic lesions. These are
difficult to
completely characterize without IV contrast. However,
differential diagnosis could include infarcts versus abscesses.
Malignancy cannot entirely be excluded, although much less
likely. Clinical correlation is advised.
3. Stable loss of paraaortic fat plane as described above. This
may be
secondary to enlarged lymph nodes, vasculitis, or
retroperitoneal
inflammation.
4. Colonic wall thickening as described above. Differential
diagnosis would include infectious or ischemic etiologies.
Evaluation for ischemia is very limited due to the lack of IV
contrast.
5. Tubes and lines in good position.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90564**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12145**] course was complicated by multiorgan failure
with ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH, active TB with cavitary lesion,
splenic and brain lesions concerning for infection vs
thromboembolic disease, liver failure of unknown etiology,
hypotension thought to be from sepsis, acholic cholecystitis,
bilateral pneumothoraces, peripheral ischemic necrosis in the
setting of pressor use.  The initial insult was never
identified, though it was initially speculated that Mr. [**Known lastname 90564**]
developed acute renal failure from toxic injestion of
medications...

? Aspirin toxicity: With metabolic acidosis and respiratory
alkalosis; however his ASA level was normal at 15 (unclear where
he was on the curve with this though). He was concurrently
taking a large amount of Ibuprofen which could have con
